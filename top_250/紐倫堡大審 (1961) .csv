0,11 September 2017,gbill-74877,9," Fantastic acting, script, and direction in a thought-provoking movie","Outstanding film. Star-studded with several fantastic performances. Highly emotional given the subject matter, but presented in a very intelligent, balanced way. I was struck at once by that, and by how well director Stanley Kramer gives us both sides of the argument – and avoids simply paying lip service to the defense of the German judges on trial. Maximilian Schell is brilliant as the defense attorney, well worthy of his Oscar, and is forceful and compelling in his arguments. There are also so many brilliant scenes. Spencer Tracy walking in the empty arena where the Nazi rallies were held, with Kramer focusing on the dais from which Hitler spoke. The testimony of Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland, both of whom are outstanding and should have gotten Oscars. Burt Lancaster in the role of one of the German judges, the one tortured by his complicity, knowing he and others are guilty. The devastating real film clips from the concentration camps, which are still spine tingling despite all we 'know' or have been exposed to. Marlene Dietrich as the German general's wife, haunted but expressing the German viewpoint, one time while people are singing over drinks. Her night stroll with Tracy, as she explains the words to one song, is touching. It just seemed like there was just one powerhouse scene after another, and the film did not seem long at all at three hours. Heck, you've even got Werner Klemperer and William Shatner before they would become Colonel Klink and Captain Kirk! In this film, the acting, the script, and the direction are all brilliant, and in harmony with one another.",/
1,1 February 2007,littlemartinarocena,9, Cinematic Theater Of A Remarkable Kind,"Beyond its compelling subject matter ""Judgement At Neuremberg"" revolutionizes the court room drama genre. The camera swings and swerves and dives between the lines of this exemplary Abby Mann script. Stanley Kramer conducts his orchestra of iconic stars with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker. The language barriers and the confinement of the action masterfully resolved. Spencer Tracy is simply magnificent and, as per usual, we believe every word that comes out of his mouth. His judge is an American monument of unsentimental humanity. Twentynine year old Maimilian Schell won the Oscar as best actor and his performance survived the test of time with the vigor of his conviction. Montgomery Cliff makes his short minutes on the screen, one of those memorable moments that nobody that has ever seen it will be able to forget. The man and the character merging into one chilling, shattering truth. ""I am half the man I've ever been"" Marlene Dietrich gives to her German aristocrat a legendary star quality. And Judy Garland, overweight and almost unrecognizable breaks your heart and gets her last Oscar nomination. My only troubles came with the stoic Burt Lancaster because I could never forget it was Burt Lancaster and with Richard Widmark's strident prosecutor. I have seen ""Judgement At Neuremberg"" more than a dozen times and it never ceases to amaze me that no matter the darkness of the subject it always manages to entertain and inspire.",r
2,11 April 2008,lastliberal,8, Hollywood's best in an important film,"It is so easy to dismiss this as a story of other people in another time in another land.

3,28 January 2009,alexkolokotronis,10," ""My counsel says we were not aware of the extermination of the millions. He would give you the excuse: We were only aware of the extermination of the hundreds.""",This quote is one of the most shocking and yet truthful quotes I have ever heard. It is one of many shocking and intense quotes in the movie. Furthermore Judgment at Nuremburg is one of the most absorbing movies I have seen. Even though most if not all of it is dialog it is very much a haunting film. This film is loosely based on the trials in Nuremburg in 1948. Right from the start the movie captures your mind and never lets it go. ,v
4,8 May 2005,Lechuguilla,10, A Film Of Enduring Value,"They say that time heals all heartache. In the case of the Third Reich, I'm not sure that the old saying is true. Out of respect for the Holocaust victims, and as an important history lesson, there's something to be said for not forgetting the evils of Hitler. Fortunately, we have this great film to help us not forget.",i
5,23 December 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Quite grim, but also very gripping","What can I say? Judgment at Nuremberg was just wonderful. At three hours, it is just mesmerising from start to finish. The subject matter of the story is admittedly grim and hard-hitting, but in the way it is put across and acted it is also incredibly gripping. The production values are striking, Ernest Gold's music is memorable and Kramer's direction is superb. Then there is the script, intelligent, thought-provoking, poignant, quite simply a brilliant screenplay, and the cast is for me one of the best on film. This film does have a lot of dignity, exemplified by Burt Lancaster's thoughtful performance as Ernst Janning, and a startling turn from Maximillian Schell. Marlene Dietrich is also great, and I also have to mention Judy Garland's touching Irene and Montgomery Clift's Rudolph. Overall, gripping and intelligent helped enormously by adept direction and acting. 10/10 Bethany Cox",e

Even Spencer Tracy, that universally beloved actor whose appeal has always escaped me, gave an honest and heartfelt portrayal of a ""simple man"" who was also a deeply conflicted judge.",r
9,14 June 2010,The_Fifth_Echo,10, ~One of the most Powerful Films ever made.~,"Judgement At Nurmeberg is a 1961 film about four Nazi Judges are in trial for crimes against humanity. Well let me just start out by saying that this is a very sad, powerful film. I was expecting it to be very boring and I guess I underestimated it. The film is also very well written, so well written that actually it makes you really think. I'm happy that it won an Oscar for writing. ",w
10,25 November 2006,bkoganbing,10, The Complainant At the Bar is Civilization Itself,"Following a trail first started by Marty, Judgment at Nuremberg is one of the first films to be taken from television.

Others in that cast were Claude Rains as Judge Haywood and Paul Lukas as the defendant Ernest Janning.",1

The focus isn't on Nazi atrocities (though they are here, in horrific images). But, this being a trial drama, ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" attempts to answer questions about humanity, beginning with HOW? ""How could this have happened?"" And, while only four mid-level Nazis receive justice, the film makes you wonder ",1
12,20 April 2010,ma-cortes,8, Magnificent film based on actual events with top-notch performances by all star cast,"A stimulating portrayal of the Nuremberg trials in which members of the German judiciary were brought to response their crimes in the immediate post-war period.The movie initiates with scenes of Nuremberg, Germany, 1948. The destruction of the war is clear everywhere. Judge Haywood(Spencer Tracy) is driven through the rotten buildings. Judge Hayward along with two other judges (Ray Teal, Kednneth Mackenna), to preside over the trial of Ministry of Justice, judges and Nazi prosecutors for their complicity in Third Reich. Hayward is helped by his assistant Harrison (William Shatner). In its opening declaration , the prosecution (an excellent prosecutor played by Richard Widmark) calls these defendants to account not for violation of due process or other constitutional violations but for killings, tortures, and cruelties committed during WWII. The accuser statements that the accused cannot claim ignorance that they should have known better for their high position and knowledges.Defender Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell) counsel's opening statement he declares that the aim of this judgment is the reestablishment of the code of justice with honor and innocence, because of judges don't make the laws . He argues the disobedience to the Fuehrer would have been choice between patriotism and treason for the justices with the subsequent firing squad. Finally the defending explains that not only are the judges on trial, so are the German people.One of the more dramatic portions of the film centers around Judge Janning's (Burt Lancaster) performance during the Feldenstein case (in real life, the Katzenberger case). Fedlenstein was charged with race mixing, of having relations with an Aryan, Irene Hoffman (Judy Garland). The trial was to be used as a showcase for National Socialism. Emil Hahn (Werner Kemplerer) had been the accuser and he was determined to find Feldenstein guilty despite evidence that he had merely been a family friend to Irene Hoffman. Hahn had told Irene that it was no use to deny having relations. That if she protected Feldenstein she would be arrested for perjury. She said she couldn't lie and was arrested. She said that Emil Hahn mocked Feldenstein, ridiculed him. Janning had been the presiding judge and he took no action to prevent the injustice. He had been the only hope for the defense since he had a reputation for being fair. Feldenstein was found guilty and executed.Prosecutor Lawson (Richard Widmark) submitted documents by which the judges and prosecutors had sent thousands to their deaths. A film was shown , a short-documentary is based on real events by means of photographs and stock-footage. As appears work camps are transformed into extermination centers to implement the policy of genocide thought at the Wannsee Conference . At the concentration camps was some minor industrial activity linked to the war effort but the main work was the execution of inmates.Millions of prisoners died in the concentration camps through mistreatment, disease, starvation, and overwork, or were executed as unfit for labor. More than six million Jews died in them, usually in gas chambers, although many were killed in mass shootings and by other means . As the documentary showed a gas chamber at Dachau , but it is a mistake because of it was never used, prisoners died from mistreatment or from execution by means other than gas. The archival footage shows tattooed skin , but Buchenwald prisoners with unusual tattoos were killed , then their skin was preserved for the tattoo collection of convicted war criminal Ilse Koch. Defense counsel speaks to the content of the films shown the previous day. He states that there is no justification for what happened, but, that it was wrong and unfair to show such films in court against these defendants. He claims that the extremists are responsible, not the defendants. He says that very few Germans knew what was going on. He claimed that the defendants stayed in their positions to keep things from getting worse. The defending then calls Irene Hoffman. In this unseemly portion of the defense, the defense counsel tries to portray Irene Hoffman as a law breaker and Judge Janning as merely doing his duty. The hypocrisy is evident and seems to bother even defense counsel Rolfe. Yet he continues to badger Irene, trying to break her down, to show that she did in fact have an affair with Feldenstein. Janning interrupts him and stops him from continuing.The next day Janning testifies about the Feldenstien case. He tells that there was fear in the country. That Hitler told the people to lift their heads. That once the gypsies, Jewish, and others were destroyed all would be well.Janning was content to sit by during his trial until he realized the same arguments were being used in this trial in his defense that had been used in the Feldenstien trial. Janning denies that Germans were unaware of the exterminations. He says that all were aware of what was going on, maybe not the details, but only because they did not want to know the details.Judge Hayward affirms the value of a single human life, and the responsibility of the justices, and by implication the German people, for their actions and inaction.

13,3 June 2002,sddavis63,10, Questions Without Answers - Which Is The History Of Nazi Germany,"Lacking the big names of what people normally think of as the ""Nuremberg Trials"" - the trial of Nazi leaders such as Goering, Hess and Speer - this movie focuses on the lesser known people who were tried for war crimes: the German judges whose responsibility it was to dispense ""justice"" in Hitler's Germany. Although the big names are missing, the movie is powerful and masterfully deals with the troubling questions around Nazism: how could normally good, decent people (represented in this movie by Ernst Janning, played by Burt Lancaster, on trial with three others) have allowed themselves to be sucked into the evil that was Hitler and National Socialism? How could the German people have turned a blind eye to what was going on and simply denied all responsibility? And the movie also considers a troubling question about the United States: if Nazism was evil enough to have warranted a war and then all the effort of the Nuremberg trials, why were the Americans suddenly so willing to ""forgive and forget"" with the onset of the Cold War and the threat of communism?",0
14,26 August 2006,Doylenf,8, Probably one of the most important films of the 1960s...still highly relevant...,"JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG was adapted from Abby Mann's TV play and turned into a masterful piece of work by director Stanley Kramer. His sterling cast included SPENCER TRACY and RICHARD WIDMARK (American judge and prosecutor, respectively), German defense attorney MAXIMILIAN SCHELL in his award-winning Best Actor role, and such impressive defendants as MARLENE DIETRICH, JUDY GARLAND and MONTGOMERY CLIFT, all giving deeply felt performances.",1

16,9 October 2006,mianaliilyas786,10, One of the most thrilling and thought provoking movie of all times,"I have always been fond of Stanley Kramer's work , but this movie proved to be quite extraordinary and exceptional .The movie has every thing you can desire and human sentiments are at there level best. The plot is written by Abby Mann who won best screenplay Oscar from that and quite deserving one. The story based on Nuremberg trials held after fall of Nazi's in Germany but this movie is nice blend of history with fiction as the major characters were fictional but the evidences and indictments presented in the trial ever authentic and truly depicts the conditions of Nazi occupied Germany. The most intriguing thing of the movie was the true representation of aftermaths of Nazi's occupation in Germany and the feeling of German toward the trial and immaculate direction of Kramer made possible to convey these types of sentiment on cinema for the very first time. The cast was also fascinating with big names like Tracy and surely he did justice with his role as he was very compelling and humble as Judge Haywood. Maximilian Schell was at his best as a compassionate enthusiastic zealous and patriotic attorney to defend the dignity of Nation. He won best actor Oscar for his role. Montgomery Clift was also the one who made this movie special as he played a role of feeble minded sterile man who was nominated for best actor in supporting role though he only played for 9 min in the movie. Burt Lancaster gave one of the most extraordinary cinematic performances as Ernst Janning. This is one of those movies which provokes our mentality and also our morality and is a treat to watch.",9
17,23 May 2021,gcsman,9, They don't make films like this any more -- and it's entirely our loss,"This 1961 film is just about as close to timeless in its impact as you can get, in its searing treatment of the universal themes of law, justice, and humanity. This far downstream, it's worth recalling that the movie was made just 15 years after the end of WWII when the aftermath of the war was still reverberating. It's set during the ""Nuremberg Trials"" of 1947-49 during which high-ranking German generals, judges, politicians and others responsible for the atrocities of the Nazi regime were tried against still-evolving standards of international law. The movie takes us through just one of these, the trial of four high-placed judges, and I was actually surprised to learn that there was an earlier, much shorter version of this drama shown 2 years earlier on the prestigious old TV series Playhouse 90. But the movie carries a wallop that no TV show could have given.",/
18,25 November 2017,lee_eisenberg,10, there are several things to consider,"Stanley Kramer's ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" is one of the most intense courtroom movies ever. Focusing on the Nazi trials after WWII, it shows how the prosecution sought to remind people that complicity extended to every segment of the population. Indeed, there were people in the courtroom who thought that Germany should forget about what happened and just move on, but the prosecution reminded everyone that forgetting about what happened could lead to a repeat of the atrocities.",?

21,25 February 2001,buckboard,10, Revelation of Horror,"This is a fine film by a fine director, but I can only hope that Stanley Kramer, in committing to full length film a television story, knew at heart the message his movie was trying to say. Because this is truly a message movie, for all mankind, but if the reviews I've read on this site are any indication, the message has been lost to some degree.",f
22,1 February 1999,rondine,10, One of the most important films about the war and its meaning in the perspective of history.,"SPOILER: This is perhaps one of the best movies regarding WWII because of the point that Spencer Tracy's character makes towards the end of the movie in his summation. He points out that the defendants were people of ability and intelligence- some were even remarkable.  If all of the people that helped this terrible thing along were depraved criminals and monsters, then these events would have no more moral significance than an earthquake or a flood. That good, even remarkable people in a time of crisis can delude themselves into heinous crimes against humanity is something to remember, to be guarded against. Personal morality is more important than the good of the state or going along with someone else's idea of right. The movie is a bit long, it actually takes the time to go into depth with the characters. It is definitely a powerful statement about personal responsibility. In one of the closing lines, Burt Lancaster's character (a defendant) tells Spencer Tracy's character (a judge) that he never knew it would come to that- all those people, he never knew. Tracy's character tells him that is came to that the minute he sentenced a man to death that he knew to be innocent.",_

In its day, JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG was a sensation ; the first film to deal seriously with the trials of Nazi war criminals. The chief Allied judge, Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy), has been sent to Germany after failing to be reelected to the bench in New England, a political payoff that does not go unnoticed by his adversaries. Prosecuting attorney Tad Lawson (Richard Widmark), an Army colonel, indicts several Germans who have committed war crimes in enforcing Hitler's mad mandates. Defense attorney Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell) roars that his clients were merely upholding Hitler's laws, and that to place them on trial is to judge all of Germany. Meanwhile, Haywood, in his off hours, wanders the ancient city of Nuremberg trying to understand what went wrong with a whole people and a great culture.",=

30,10 December 2008,thinker1691,9," "" Just for laughs general, what was the war all about? ""","There are many people in the world today who suffered the tattooed numbers, visible scars, tortured memory and indelible atrocities of the Concentration Camps. It's strange for a history teacher to hear that many want to forget the past, the pain and agonizing suffering inflicted on the innocent. For those who were actually there, or had friends, family or loved ones murdered by the Nazis, there can be no erasing the past. Occasionally a courageous film arises which endeavors to bring to light the black memories which so many wish would go away. In this black and white film called "" Judgement at Nuremberg "" the audience is offered a dramatic depiction of the War Crimes trial of the German Judges who themselves sent so many to die to appease their Nazi leaders. The star power of this movie is what makes it a monumental triumph and a fitting tribune to the victims of the Germanic court. In this story, based on the courtroom dockets of the Nuremberg trials, we have Spencer Tracy playing Chief Judge Dan Haywood, an American judge who makes an obvious observation and says, 'I've been here for some time now and as far as I can tell, No one, knew what was going on.' Burt Lancaster is Dr. Ernst Janning, the most senior judge on trial, who tried to explain the fervor of the times, the 'passing phase', saying, ""I never meant for things to go that far."" Richard Widmark plays Col. Tad Lawson, who's despite his serious and sober evidence, is asked to show leniency. Maximilian Schell is brilliant as Hans Rolfe, the defense attorney. Werner Klemperer is Emil Hahn and William Shatner as Capt. Harrison Byers. True there are other stars of great distinction, but you must see the movie, to see how each contributed to make this incredible movie into a film Classic. ****",

Some of the thoughts I had about that picture I would second here as well. Neither one of these movies has made it into the American Film Institute list of Top One Hundred films, and only ""Judgment at Nuremburg"" cracks IMDb's own list of Top 250 films. That is an oversight I can't really understand, given some of the films that have been accorded such rank.

Except for Tracy and Dietrich, everybody has bursts of overacting. Schell is interesting to watch not because his is a great performance, but because he is so incredibly hammy.

We don't get a simplistic presentation of them as monsters. They were men who were forced to make decisions that may not be moral but which put country first. There is a real sense that we are the flies on the walls of Spencer Tracy's office. He is determined to make the correct decision and decide whether these men should be executed.

41,24 June 2021,nickenchuggets,9," ""We must forget if we want to go on living""","Out of all the movies I've seen that pertain to the second world war, Judgement at Nuremberg has got to be one of the best. It does have some problems, but for the most part, this is one of the most impressive and important movies ever made. It doesn't really concern world war 2, but involves itself with it in an indirect way. The year following the end of the war (1946) saw many of the remaining leaders of Hitler's Germany rounded up and made to stand trial before an international tribunal in the city of Nuremberg. The defendants included such men as Albert Speer, Hitler's architect and armaments minster, as well as Karl Doenitz, head of the german navy, and Hermann Goering, leader of the luftwaffe. The defendants were made to watch horrible footage of the ""final solution"", which was Hitler's plan to rid Europe once and for all of people he said were racially inferior. After the trials, most of the former leaders were convicted of crimes against humanity, basically meaning what they did was so atrocious it was offensive to everyone, and then they were executed. Goering committed suicide before he could be hanged. This movie's title is a bit misleading, because it's not about those trials done right after the war. It concerns itself with different trials later in the 40's. Spencer Tracy plays judge Dan Haywood, who is the leader of the judges overseeing the trial against former nazi judges. It soon becomes clear that the former nazis are not going to be the pushovers the tribunal is expecting. One of the defendants (Janning) is a highly intelligent and imposing man, and he's unwilling to go down without a fight. One of the movie's highlights is the lawyer Hans Rolfe, played by Max Schell. He is probably one of the best things the movie has to offer, since he tries to defend Hitler's actions several times in the courtroom, saying how America did things just as bad as the germans (if not worse). He brings up eugenics programs conducted in the US and the nukes dropped on Japan at the end of the war. Horrendous exhibits are shown to the court, including USA serial number ""254""; a shrunken human head used as a paperweight. The trouble is, it's easy to show the evil of the nazi regime. Even the men who used to wear swastikas on their way to work each day can't defend what was just shown, but none of this is enough to connect them to a major crime committed during the war. Later on, Judy Garland appears as the character Irene Hoffmann, who is accused of having a sexual relationship with a non-aryan. It shows how the average german also had to be complacent and accepting of the reich's laws, no matter how absurd they seemed. Near the end, the Soviets blockade Berlin, and Americans are forced to fly in food and supplies to them in what would eventually become known as the Berlin Airlift. By now, Judge Haywood knows he has to do what he has to do, even if he doesn't feel it's right. He understands the importance of giving the former nazis a light sentence, because it will help bolster german support against the USSR. At the same time, he can't turn a blind eye to the things these men did during the war. All four defendants are found guilty and receive life imprisonment. At the end, the movie says as of 1961, none of the 99 defendants tried at the second Nuremberg trials were still serving jail time. This is an excellent movie. There's some things to nitpick, like how Marlene Dietrich plays Tracy's love interest but mostly disappears towards the end, but this one's got it where it counts. Burt Lancaster as Ernst Janning is one of the most believable characters in the movie, and as a former nazi, he understands the shameful past his countrymen wants to put behind them. He barely speaks in this movie, but his actions speak louder than words. Schell is without a doubt one of the movie's strong points, and he really starts to lose his temper several times during the trial, even screaming at Garland when she doesn't admit to being in the ""blood defiling"" relationship. It is a very long movie, but that's just because there are a lot of things to experience in it. It was made so we may never forget what that horrible conflict 80 years ago did to everyone who was involved, and those who forget history are forced to relive unpleasant events. Schell also walked off with the oscar for best actor due to this film, which is hardly surprising.",

JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG could have fallen into such a trap. Its subject matter is no doubt important, but the movie never feels dry or self-important, if that makes any sense.

Brilliant.,"Bought this some time ago but then found the prospect of a three hour courtroom drama somewhat daunting and have only just got round to it. I needed to have no such concern. Not only is it not completely restricted to the courtroom but filled with great acting performances and superbly paced. Of course it is affecting and worrying with ghastly moments but it is completely involving and riveting from start to finish. This must have been a considerable enterprise for director Stanley Kramer to embark upon but, presumably with his help and guidance, everyone seems to have stepped up to give amazing performances. Spencer Tracy, Montgomery Clift, Richard Widmark seem at the top of their game whilst that of Burt Lancaster is sublimely remarkable. Maximilian Schell maybe overdoes it occasionally but within the context this seems appropriate enough whilst the utterly controlled performance from Judy Garland is a sensation. Marlene Dietrich is a welcome participant if not quite a match for the others but the real surprise is William Shatner. Here the man gives an immaculate performance with no intent of the tendency to overdo things that would seem to plague him hereafter. The whole is a wonderful experience and if the three hour running time is off putting watch it in two sittings. Essential viewing that is a really engrossing and heart stopping experience.

The film concerns an American judge (Spenser Tracy) sent to Germany to preside over a war-crimes trial at a point when American politicians are less concerned about justice than about securing German support re the Cold War. As such, the film concerns not only the Nazi atrocities on trial, but the American government's willingness to become accomplices after the fact if such will buttress America's own military interests. The film repeatedly raises questions concerning the price of such deliberate, feigned public ignorance--both as it was manifest in Nazi Germany before and during the war and as it is now becoming manifest in America and its allies after the war.",

In this movie, the issue is the leadership of the country and its accountability for the war, and how that accountability will be handled.  No one escapes criticism as the protagonists try to assign blame.  Stunning performances all around (even from William Shatner!) and cinematography that proves why b/w films were art.  In the end, though, it all comes down to the moral decisions we each make as individuals and our willingness to live with our choices.

55,12 August 2016,barryrd,9, Court drama in postwar Germany,"Directed by Stanley Kramer, this movie is the story of a great courtroom drama involving judges of Nazi Germany. The judges, including a great jurist who became the Minister of Justice, administered laws aimed at imposing racial purity and mandatory sterilization. Human beings were treated as pawns in the hands of these men in the name of the Nazi state. The presiding judge, played superbly by Spencer Tracey, is a model of integrity. In the role of the former minister of justice is Burt Lancaster, a cut above the other small-minded tyrants who had no conscience in carrying out their cruel sentences to produce the master race. Despite his character and his great legal mind, he too was complicit in the tragedy. In fact, his sharp sense of revulsion about these crimes, made him even more repellant as he went against his own conscience and training. The other cast members include Maximilian Schell as the defence attorney, Richard Widmark as the prosecuting attorney, Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift as key witnesses as well as victims, and Marlene Dietrich as the widow of wartime criminal already executed. All the cast are outstanding. While the story is overly long, we get a strong sense of the characters and how Tracey as a judge lived and mingled with the people of Nuremberg during his time in the occupied post-war country. The director, Stanley Kramer, made movies that showed people of conscience in conflict with the established order. He made use of great acting talents like Burt Lancaster and Spencer Tracey to issue strong statements of principle. This movie is a prime example of his great legacy as a director.",

However, Abby Mann's grave and somewhat verbose teleplay is never particularly entertaining. Spencer Tracy is a Maine judge sent to Germany to oversee the trial of four German judges accused of crimes against humanity. Tracy is quite stoic and the film offers a number of great parts for a number of great actors: Montgomery Clift; Burt Lancaster; Marlene Dietrich; Judy Garland. Garland in particular is astounding in the role of a German woman forced to relive the horrors she endured under the Third Reich. Richard Widmark is the American prosecutor and he's well matched against Maximillian Schell as the fiery German defense attorney. Filmed both on location and on a Hollywood sound stage, the film is decidedly non-cinematic; as though Kramer did not want to present such a serious subject in any way that may seem too flashy. Werner Klemperer, Edward Binns and William Shatner are in it too. The music score is by Ernest Gold and the B&W cinematography is by Ernest Laszlo. Clift, unable to remember his dialog, reportedly improvised much of his part. Director Kramer would lighten up considerably with his next film (IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD).",

65,17 November 1999,joe7,10, Powerful Stuff About Postwar Germany And Human Nature,"World War II has just ended. Nuremberg, like the rest of Germany, is to a great extent still rubble but people are already starting to try to forget the whole thing and frequent bars and restaurants again, along with members of the American occupying forces. Most seem to be relieved the war is over and to get on with life. The last of the war crime trials against lower-ranking Nazis are taking place.                                  In this setting we meet several characters: Madame Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich), the aristocratic German lady who disliked Hitler but is now nevertheless suffering the consequences of the war, having lost all including her military husband; the American Col. Lawson (Richard Widmark), the prosecutor at the war crime trials who, in a moment of drunkeness, admits his discomfort in occupying a country with an older and grander history than his own; Hans Rolfe, defense attorney for the defendants, who just might feel an underlying guilt over the ruthlessness he'll have to show in the courtroom but which nevertheless is required by him to best serve his legal calling; and the great Spencer Tracy as the presiding American Judge Haywood. The judge has been given Madame Bertholt's grand house to live in for the trial, and a perfect example of how this film shows the wide range of emotions in most human beings is his obvious guilt of invading this fine lady's house (even though she was the enemy) and the instant attraction between them. The wide range of emotions are so well portrayed in this film, which probably accurately represent the spectrum of people in Germany at this time. Nothing is black and white, no one is a total villain, everyone is a complicated human being. The dialogue is always electrifying, and this isn't even taking into account the courtroom drama (which is about half the film's time); which is genuinely disturbing..though this is primarily through the acting: Judy Garland as a woman reliving her past nightmare of inprisonment for having associated with a Jew; and Montgomery Clift as a man who underwent forced medical sterilization for being a Communist (Clift's portrayal of this wreck of a man is one of the best most heartbreaking pieces of acting you'll ever see). There's also an incredible speech by defendant Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster) at the end which just might be the greatest insight, perhaps,  into why the Third Reich was so successful at sweeping Germany.          This film absolutely rates a ten.",

Spencer Tracy portrays the chief trial judge on a three-judge panel; Burt Lancaster is defendant Ernst Janning, a legal scholar and an exterminator of lives; Marlene Dietrich is the widow of a German general who had been executed by the Allies; Maximilian Schell is Hans Rolfe, the German defense attorney who suggests that U.S. forces committed acts that were as bad as those of the Nazis. Producer-director Stanley Kramer and screenwriter Abby Mann, adapting his ""Playhouse 90"" presentation from 1959, cook up an intense (if long-winded) verbal sparring match in the courtroom, and each of the actors is given a solo moment in the spotlight to sound off. While the material is certainly gripping, Kramer's presentation is so baleful and lumbering as to seem occasionally inert. This was the social message drama of its year, so naturally the Oscars came calling (the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences loves prestige, and this anguished epic ups the ante by casting A-list actors in every key role). Nominated for 11 Academy Awards (winning two, for Schell as Best Actor and Mann for his writing), the picture served its purpose and brought a devastating chapter to light--but, in the end, it's a Hollywood light, and there's a smug, self-congratulatory air about the film that keeps it from being a truly emotional document. **1/2 from ****",

'Judgement at Nuremberg (1961)' wears its pretensions on its sleeve, a film so utterly convinced of its own importance that Kramer must surely have already known about the eleven Oscar nominations before he opened production. Fortunately, much of this self-importance is quite justified. The epic 186-minute courtroom drama tackles some of the fundamental issues in the aftermath of WWII, such as the accountability of higher citizens for the Holocaust and how patriotism has the ability to corrupt human morals.

I never thought that one day I myself would want to watch this three-hour court drama, where there is practically nothing but dialogues, but it happened. In general, pictures in the genre of ""court drama"" were very popular in the West in the second half of the twentieth century, and before this picture I saw several of them - and they did not really impress me, but not this picture. All three hours I watched as if I was under hypnosis, unable to take my eyes off the screen. Looked - and now I'm ready to beat myself with sticks for not having appreciated this masterpiece earlier, which has earned several Oscars, deservedly belongs to the classics of world cinema, and has a cult status both in the West and in our country. And here's my brief opinion - Judges judge judges. I want to say right away that I did not find any shortcomings in this picture, but I have a small comment, which I will express in a separate paragraph, but for now, let your humble servant focus your attention on the expressive merits of this masterpiece directed by Stanley Kramer.
So, here they are:
1. The story told - the script of the picture is based on the so-called ""Little Nuremberg"" - a trial in the American occupation zone in post-war Germany, where judges appeared in the dock, who enforced the monstrous laws and policies of the Third Reich and Adolf Hitler personally. Of course, the real names were changed, because this is an art picture. For three hours we have to watch a loud trial, where all the horrors and atrocities of Nazism will appear before us, the duel between the chief prosecutor - the American colonel and the defense lawyer - who has no less weighty arguments, and the judge - an ordinary provincial who arrived in Nuremberg in order to deliver an honest and just judgment. Each of the heroes presented in the picture (both primary and secondary) are bright and interesting personalities, for one can see competent and high-quality script work. Even if the hero has only a few lines, you can still see his essence, no matter how hard he tries to hide it.
2. Nazism - or fascism, whichever pleases more (I am used to calling fascism). This picture is very detailed about this phenomenon, its causes and consequences. Both sides of this ideology are shown. After all, for example, in the Soviet film ""Ordinary Fascism"" director Mikhail Romm considered only one side, while Stanley Kramer described and showed it in full. Who is to blame for the establishment of fascism? Who brought Hitler to power? Is it true that the German people knew nothing about the mass extermination of people? Of course, the German people are to blame for fascism (to one degree or another), and of course the Germans knew about the monstrous atrocities. But we never learned anything, which is why Hitler and other leaders of the Reich have long been dead - and their ideas are alive, and will live on until we understand what this phenomenon is - fascism, and why he won in Germany. Only after learning this lesson of history, society is able to develop a strong antidote to this, because we are waiting for a repetition of this nightmare (even in Russia, which is especially offensive).
3. Politics - during the trial, the Cold War and the first Berlin crisis have already begun, which can greatly influence the court's decision, and this is bad when the political situation prevents the establishment of the truth and the passing of a fair verdict. The atmosphere of those years is perfectly conveyed, you can't even argue here. And how difficult it is at this moment for people who want justice, and nothing more. Post-war Germany, all in ruins, the aspirations of the German people, foreign soldiers in their native land, hope for the mercy of the victors - all this is also present.
4. Music - a lot of German songs from the Second World War, some of which I know. They fit perfectly into the atmosphere and perfectly dilute the tension in the courtroom.
5. Timing - the picture runs for three hours, but it looks in one breath, and this is a judicial drama, where the basis is dialogues and a competition between the prosecutor and the defender. This is what a great script means that doesn't let the viewer get bored. Learn, modern screenwriters!
6. Final - I confess to you that I was looking forward to the final of this trial, because I found reasonable arguments from each of the parties, and politics also put a lot of pressure on the judge, but he delivered the only possible sentence in this situation, although I was strongly disagree. I have no right to describe it, so as not to spoil the viewing for those who have not yet had time to get acquainted with this picture, but I will say only one phrase that accurately describes both the final and the whole picture ""We have not learned anything!""
7. Thoughts - the picture makes you think, reflect, ask yourself questions. Not only about fascism, but about human existence, society, state, politics. This sounds especially relevant, given that a year after the release of the picture, the Caribbean crisis happened - which almost led to a nuclear war between the USSR and the United States, which would be the end for humanity. And only at the last minute was it possible to save the world and millions of lives from this threat. The United States is shown honestly, with its laws and the atomic bombings of Japan. This movie makes you think, and not just catch delight from explosions, like most modern films.
Comment. The fact is that in one of the scenes the Munich Agreement was not mentioned, which gave Germany the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia (without the participation of the latter). It was signed by Germany (Adolf Hitler), Italy (Benitto Mussolini), France (Daladier) and Great Britain (Chamberlain), this is for reference. This is a small addition, and nothing more.
A little about the main characters:
1. Dan Heywood, played by Spencer Tracy, is a former district court judge who arrived in Nuremberg to pronounce an honest and fair verdict on the German judges. An elderly gentleman, keenly interested in this process and all its materials, for the sake of which he studies Nuremberg and its inhabitants. Spencer splendidly played the role of the venerable judge, for whom truth and justice are above politics and momentary goods. Bravo!
2. Colonel Ted Lawson, played by Richard Widmark, is a US Army officer, a prosecutor who wants the defendants to be punished for their heinous crimes. Harsh, honestly, he is driven by exceptionally high motives, despite the tense political situation. Richard played this role equally convincingly and superbly. Bravo!
3. Ernst Young, played by Bert Lancaster, is a Juris Doctor and one of the defendants in this trial, who is kept separate from the rest. His fiery speech was so strong and convincing that one wonders. I even developed respect for him, because he showed himself as a real person who realizes his sins. Bert perfectly portrayed this image on the screen. Bravo!
I would like to mention Maximillian Schell as the lawyer of Hans Rolf and the famous beauty with a cold look Marlene Dietrich as the widow of the executed general.
The picture has earned its place in the history of cinematography, and what a pity that mankind has not learned anything! Despite my tiny remark, I can only give the picture the highest rating.
As a result, we have an excellent historical drama about the trial of fascist judges, with an excellent script, excellent music and atmosphere, analysis of the phenomenon of ""fascism"" and great acting work.",

Film Versions)--A Cast Comparison,"Judgment at Nuremberg (JAN) is an award winning teleplay by Abby Mann that was originally directed for TV by George Roy Hill. It was first presented to the public during the Golden Age Of Television in a live 1959 Playhouse 90 broadcast. Two years later, it was produced and directed by Stanley Kramer as a major Hollywood motion picture that eventually has achieved something approaching classic status. JAN continues to interest us, provoke us to serious thought and discussion, and motivate us to question the meaning of responsible behavior during a time of national crisis.

102,31 July 2013,MrSpark,10, Thought provoking,"This film is a masterpiece which ever way you look at it. Directed by the master, Stanley Kramer, it shows us the trial of four Nazi judges in 1948. The acting is most intriguing, Spencer Tracy delivers a very fine performance while Burt Lancaster enhances his character with both disgust and empathy from the viewers. But the most astounding performance in this film is given by Richard Widmark who profoundly enchants the viewers and actually is able to persuade them, at least to a point, and creates a cloud of doubt amidst the thought provoking premise of the film. The story of the film elopes with a distorted ethical and moral thought provoking atmosphere that leaves the viewers in total awe. It brings out questions of morality and surpasses boundaries that even the most disturbed people find repulsive. It is simply one of the best courtroom dramas. The cinematography is simple yet sophisticated. Most of the film takes place in a courtroom but there are scenes that add to the elegance of this films such as scenes around post-war Germany. The film also shows us original footage in concentration camps during the war that inclines the viewer to explode emotionally either with disgust or pure horror. The final lines in the film truly change every perspective of human morality that might have been conceived by the viewers. To summarize, Judgment at Nuremberg is a thought provoking courtroom drama with moral and ethical questions that pushes the viewers understanding of humanity to the limits. It is comprised by beautiful acting, great directing and fine cinematography. The film ends with a moral message that many interpret differently. As such and with nothing further to add this film deserves a 10/10.",

The particular trial, based on an earlier TV film also written by Abby Mann, is fictional, but founded on fact. A very high quality cast keeps the viewer engaged.

Of course. what the defendants did was horrific, and they ought to have been held accountable for it, but was it illegal? By what law? By whose law? Shouldn't there be a distinction between acting against a Nazi law and acting against a moral law? Aren't we really looking at a sort of self-righteous 'victor's justice'?

Although both movies hang their hat on historical events, neither film is actually about the surface events in the film. Directed by the same man and released within a year of each other, their purpose was to get audiences rooting for the forces of reason, and oppose the irrationality of the herd mentality Judgment at Nuremburg is about a fictional trial of German judges who let themselves be swept up in the ethnic hatred promoted by the Nazis, delivering verdicts that they had decided upon before the trials over violations of racial purity laws had even begun. The film was written as a reaction against McCarthyism, which had gripped America for a decade and burned out just five years before the film. The film intended to show the danger of movements of mass hysteria, and how easy it is for an entire society to commit atrocities in the name of defending their country. The movie's tactics are heavy-handed. You can almost see the defense attorney getting rabid as he uses the same vicious illogic to attack the prosecution's witnesses as he used to shred the defense's witnesses when he prosecuted defendants on behalf of the Third Reich. If that weren't obvious enough, the movie drives the point home with a monologue from one of the defendants about how the judges lied to themselves -- first to protect their country from the Russian threat, then to save themselves at the expense of innocent people. A modern American audience might be entitled shake their heads at the absurdity of Nazism and McCarthyism, if it weren't for the same phenomenon taking place today, with Muslim terrorists being the scapegoats and justification for a range of brutalities and civil rights restrictions.",

It is a difficult subject, to be sure, because they were acting, in the statement of the defense attorney, for the benefit of their country, right or wrong. Patriotism, an American virtue, is to be practiced by German patriots who felt that Germany was correct in its quest to rid the world of certain undesirable groups.

The Germans acted exactly as portrayed in the movie in the post-war era. No one knew anything, and no one saw anything. Millions disappeared, no one noticed. OK. That's believeable. Additionally, the interactions between the Americans and the Germans was perfectly depicted in the film, and as to Klemperer's character being a joke, it should be remembered that many Nazis acted exactly like that--totally defiant--during the trials. Meanwhile, to say that the Germans were not well defended by Schell's charater is totally wrong. Perhaps that is where this reviewer was wrong more than any area.

This movie is about shame.  It is about the shame that some people should have felt right after the war when the US decided that it was politically necessary to forgive Germans for their criminal conduct in order to obtain their help in fighting communism.  The major Nuremberg Trial (of Goering, Hess, Speer et al) was over.  The subsequent trials were not prosecuted by Justice Robert Jackson, but were handed over to other prosecutors.

Namely, that it is the responsibility (not the right) of good men to disobey bad laws. When you commit an immoral act, the fact that it is legal, or in keeping with the law at the time, is not a good enough excuse. This point was driven home by the script of ""Judgment"". When Spencer Tracy tells the Nazi judge that he destroyed his creditability the first time he sentenced a man to death that he knew to be innocent, the power of this movie comes into focus.

The final words of the judge to the convicted Nazi judge are, roughly, ""You became responsible for the millions of victims the first time you sentenced a man to death whom you knew to be innocent."" It's a fine sentiment, and one we hope we would try to live up to today. But how realistic is it? Is it anything more than poetry, high-sounding phrases? If it is truly meaningful, then I don't think the lessons have been learned, because similar things are still happening. While they are not comparable to the atrocities of Nazi Germany, the same kind of corruption is still with us. When America feels threatened by terrorists, its justice department finds legal justifications for torture. In Texas a governor refuses to save a man from execution even when DNA evidence proves his innocence, for political reasons, as the public, frightened by crime, cries out for blood and a scapegoat.

141,26 February 2006,irajoel,2, judging Hitler,"Yes the film raises serious questions about Nazi Germany and the role that Germans played in the terrible destruction that the third Reich wrecked on the world, but the film is seriously dated and terribly preachy with some very over the top acting and in your face direction. Kramer's direction is obvious with lots of zoom shots and close-ups and is also terribly stagy and slow. Maxmillian Schell in a very overrated performance plays the defense lawyer, and his work is no where as good as Paul Newman's stunning performance in ""The Hustler."" Schell won the Oscar that year over Newman, but his performance is all one note or two. Judy Garland and Monty Clift give some depth and feeling to their small cameos, but both also have done much better work through the years. I will say that Dietrich was terrific in her small role and Tracy was also fine and low keyed as he usually was. The worst performance was given by Burt Lancaster who was way to young to play this part with any conviction and had to depend on his badly done hair and make-up to give any feeling that he could come up with. You can see how bad he is in his big confession scene at the trial and also his stance,posture and walk are all wrong, and way too young. I also had trouble with the static camera work and the poor art direction and process shots, and the throwing in of actual concentration camp footage was a cheap shot and the only real emotional moment in the film and points up to how badly directed the it was. The view outside the courtroom never changes and the trees and foliage look way to fake I know this is minor criticism but it makes the film look tacky and cheap. At times the film resembles a television drama which in fact it originally was. The film was a big critical hit in 1961 and received an amazing 11 Oscar nominations include one for best costume????. This was serious stuff with a capital S back then, and was the verso of the other big reserved seat film of the year ""West Side Story.""

Perhaps the strongest point made by the movie is raised by Maximilian Schell as the defense attorney when he reads the majority opinion of the US Supreme Court written by Oliver Wendell Holmes in the Virginia eugenics decision where he justifies the sterilization of women, and it is rejected by the court. The justices at Nuremberg, both in reality and in the film, exercise the legal argument of tu tuque to reject the defense. (What we have done doesn't count - what you have done does count.) This is further exemplified many years later in the US military court's handling of the My Lai massacre in Viet Nam.

The message of the film helps to weigh the circumstances of the human side and the consequences of the Nazi regime, but with the duration of 3 hours, after a while it becomes tedious. On the other hand the performances are very good and all are delivered with vigor to their characters, which always helps to maintain interest.

149,27 April 2005,coop-16,9," An extremely powerful, if slightly ""preachy""film.","Stanley Kramer was a good, if often over-emphatic director of ""message""movies. this, is,undoubtedly, his finest effort.The title, Judgement At Nuremberg, might lead a naive viewer to think that it was about the Nuremburg trial of the major Nazi war criminals. Instead, he focuses on a lesser known, but historically-and philosophically even more interesting trial, the trial of the Nazi JUDGES.How was it that German judges-some of whom were, cultured, liberal, sensitive men, like the Burt Lancaster character-became collaborators with the Nazi regime? this film features fantastic performances by Tracy, Lancaster, Schell, Dietrich, Widmark, Clift, and even Judy Garland. This is an interesting film, because it is a film about Moral and political dilemmas. Each of the major characters faces a moral choice. Lancaster was a liberal Wiemar intellectual/Judge, who thought he could ""work with' the Nazis, and became corrupted by them. Dietrich plays the widow of a German general, who claims to have been a ""good"" German. Tracy plays an American judge, who is under political pressure to go easy on the Judges, and who is also fascinated by the Dietrich character. Widmark is the American prosecutor, a military officer who is under pressure from his superiors to ""let up"" in prosecuting the Germans( the cold war is getting underway,and the American high command does not want to antagonize a potential ally.).The most complex-and fascinating-character is played by Maximilian Schell,as Lancaster's brilliant, sometimes frighteningly. convincing, defense attorney. Clift and Garland play two victims of the Nazi ""legal system"". Underlying the whole narrative are two profound philosophical questions. 1.Is the law merely a set of commands by the sovereign, or should it reflect moral imperatives? 2. Why do liberal societies-like Weimar Germany-succumb to totalitarianism? In short, a very powerful, interesting film. I should add one comment in response to a previous reviewer.Let me say that even though I am a conservative-and a reluctant Bush voter-I am highly critical of many aspects of the current administrations policies.Still, to draw some sort of facile parallel between The Bush administration and the Hitler regime is more than an exercise in poor taste, it is absurd. Bush has many, many faults but he is no Nazi. The People who constantly make facile comparisons between modern America and the third Reich are utterly irresponsible.",

The concept of a war crimes trials congers up scenes of outraged, indignant prosecutors who, with exaggerated self-righteousness, are loudly and vociferously denouncing the defendants who sit passively and take it. This movie, however, presents a different slant. Here it is the defense that is outraged, and with good reason. Did the defendants actually break any laws? After all, were they not respected judges? Is somebody to be found guilty for being a mere hack? And what right did the court have to try these judges anyway? Okay, the judges may have been Nazis, but was being a Nazi a crime? Indeed, was the trial itself a sham? Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland give powerful performances as victims of Nazi persecution, yet was their testimony sufficient to establish guilt, and of what? This is one of the most powerful movies Hollywood as ever produced.

As well as this film featuring Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, Maximilian Schell, and Montgomery Clift all in superb performances. The film is loosely based on the 1948 Nuremberg trials which originally had 99 defendants but with this film only having four of five, the movie stars Spencer Tracy as Chief Judge Dan Haywood who presides on the case against the defendants Ernst Janning (played by Burt Lancaster), Emil Hahn (played by Werner Klemperer), Friedrich Hofstetter (played by Martin Brandt),and Werner Lampe (played by Torben Meyer). Abby Mann's very suspenseful screenplay is also a very intense one because we don't know whether the four defendants will be found guilty or not because of the reasons that the prosecution and the defense bring to the table all because of the rivaling performances from Richard Widmark (who played prosecutor Tad Lawso)n and Maximilian Schell (who played the defense attorney Hans Rolfe and ended up winning an Oscar for his performance), this is Kramer's absolute best film as a director and also one of 1961's 10 best films.",

The trial accounted for most of the film, but many of the most intense and exciting confrontations occurred outside the court. There are many elements in this world. Although I am not willing to admit it or believe it, sometimes you have to compromise for reality and make sacrifices. When the American judge listened to the consideration of his colleagues and looked at the German judge outside the window, he found that the one outside the window was the same fellow who cherished his sympathy. He had the same justice execution ideals and the same cynicism. It is a pity that not all questions have an accurate answer. From the perspective of hindsight, everyone can become a saint. This is a ridiculous world. Justice is at most a pursuit and never a state, not a second, because this world is not black and white, or either. One judge goes to judge another, and looks at the world from the standpoint of another person. This is the virtue of man, because the world is full of people's evaluation and judgment of others, but no one comes from the future. Comprehension and love are the solutions of this world, not the answers. The trial is just a conclusion, not justice, and the answer to justice does not exist. After receiving the harsh verdict, the German judge realized that he was trying himself, so in the end he thought that he had received a fair trial and asked to meet with the American judge.

Long before ""Schindler's List"" however, there was a film that was just as controversial, a film that didn't so much emphasize on the struggle of the Jews during the holocaust, but more so on the war criminals who butchered them close to extinction and the trials that sent them for life imprisonment. But unlike a lot of films regarding this era, this court room drama didn't just pin it on the Nazis, but questioned the world about the tragedy. It turns out, that the three hours ""Judgment At Nuremberg"" ran for were some of the most engaging, hair-raising and heart-wrenching experiences of my life.",
190,1 April 2013,huzefakl,9, An unbiased and thought provoking look at whether German citizens must be made accountable for large scale crimes committed by there fellow countrymen.,"I was completely engrossed in this movie from the very first scene. What surprised me the most was that a movie that was made so soon after the war and the trials could give an unbiased and thought provoking perspective about German's and their middle tier of leadership. There is struggle shown about how one should stand up against their leaders and still remain patriotic. How can one report or stop mass murder, wide scale racism and human rights violations when it is being committed by the authorities. Should all citizens be blamed for the crimes of their fellow countrymen?",
191,25 February 2004,Krippler,7, 7 out of 10,"""Judgment at Nuremberg"" features great performances from Lancaster, Garland, Clift and Oscar winner Schell. Spencer Tracy is rather boring until the finale. The length and the strange cinematography really took away from the overall strengths of the movie, which were the performances. A good historical story which I think is worth watching if you have 3 hours to kill. I don't know about anyone else, but the fact that William Shatner was there bothered me. He'll always be Kirk to me I guess. Also, be prepared to see Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland looking very very old. The non-courtroom scenes really were boring and seemed rather awkward, like they didn't belong in the film.",

196,14 June 2011,rdukeesq,10, one of the best films of all time,"So I watched the award winning ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" from 1961, and directed by Stanley Kramer. So is this movie a classic, I say yeah! So not only is this movie a classic, I would rank it among one of the best films I have ever seen. This movie has twists and turns like a suspense thriller, but is very subtle in those twists and turns, they are neither obvious nor are they possibly even intentional. This film is brilliantly written, it is brilliantly acted, was wonderfully cast, and directed by a master. This film is both unflinching at times, and surprising at other times. These surprises aren't typical surprises in the traditional sense, these are the twists and turns you feel. Every moment you feel is building to some sort of sympathy by the head Judge played by Spencer Tracey for the German's particularly one of the defendants played stoically by Burt Lancaster, but he is pragmatic and unforgiving without being angry or vengeful in the end. I personally think his performance was better than Maximilian Schell's, which garnered him a well deserved Oscar. In addition to these brilliant roles, there are strong roles played by Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, and Richard Widmark. Additionally, there were roles performed by iconic characters of the small screen, by Captain Kirk in one of his first film roles, and Colonel Klink from ""Hogan's Heroes"" (Werner Klemperer). So basically this movie is moving, surprising, exquisitely acted, wonderfully written, perfectly cast, classic in every sense of the word, and award winning. So yeah I think it is one of the best films of all time, even if you don't agree with that sentiment, I would be surprised if you watch this film and don't love it. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",
197,11 September 2010,thrwmbsbgkdoepmcjrmrdw,1, Not the greatest,"I think that it went a little too far with all the footage of the real camps. Yes, those things happened and while it may have been important to the story to show some, I don't think it was necessary to show as much as they did. The movie was also very long and got a bit boring. I think that it would have been better had they cut it down some. Though I do think that CLift was robbed of yet another Oscar. Shell did deserve his Oscar. I think that all the acting was very well preformed. Lancasters should have been nominated. He did a wonderful job just sitting there with a blank expression on his face for most of the movie.",

A story within stories, not all of which I would have wanted but perhaps needed to see. If it weren't as brilliant and engrossing, I wouldn't have held out for 3 hours.

As we ignore the cries of a suffering world be it the unwanted of Africa's war torn continent or the voiceless who find themselves but chess pieces in a power struggle over oil in the middle east or those who have no worth to a world which only finds worth in one's ability to consume, the simple truth that all of the world's ills and guilt can be found in the degeneration of a single human life is as sadly true today as it was when the world's first victim's cries went unheard by the ""decent"" who watched on in silent self satisfaction.",

204,1 May 2011,stephenrtod,10, The Greatest Generation - on Film,I have watched this movie countless times since it came out in 1961 when I was 16. My father and I often watched and commented on movies that delved deeply into character and ethical issues. It was his way of sharing and discussing his most fervent beliefs and values - and I did the same for 40 years of teaching: using film to augment literature and life issues.,

Great courtroom drama about the Nazi Germany and moral code & responsibilities of domestic and world powers!,"This movie is a great courtroom drama! It is interesting as it speaks of a very evil time of Nazi Germany. The plot of the movie is very well done, but this movie is about 30 minutes too long. Some ""non-courtroom"" scenes could easily be cut. I loved the cast in this movie. Which is always pretty much the most important factor determining the greatness of a particular movie.",
208,19 February 2008,zeedunn,10, We are all susceptible,"Although Judgment at Nuremberg was made back in 1961, the questions raised in this film are as relevant today as they were back then. The movie is a fictionalized account of a real trial that took place in 1947. Judges that helped send Jews, liberals, and other ""undesirables"" to their deaths inside Nazi Germany concentration camps were put on trial for their part.",
209,30 June 2016,cosmonema,9, The Burden of Responsibility,"Are you responsible for heinous acts sanctioned by you even when you were ""just following orders""? How true is the mantra ""My country, right or wrong""? The movie delves deeply into this issues, while touching on topics of justice, race, eugenics, feeble-mindedness (WTF?), forced sterilizations, and other horrors of Nazi Germany. Also, a particularly poignant moment in the movie was the infamous Feldenstein Case, where a German woman was to testify. Just imagine the wrath of neighbors and fellow countrymen that person has to tolerate to contemplate doing this. This is just one nugget, the movie is chock full with these. Performances of Spencer Tracy (Chief Judge Dan Haywood) and Maximilian Schell (Hans Rolfe) were particularly good, the latter netting an Oscar for his stellar work.",
210,10 September 2007,m_palmer45,7," Great dialog, but unconvincing characters","The makers of this movie deserve credit for taking on a difficult subject - the culpability of dutiful servants of a terror regime - and for trying to illuminate it from both moral and legal angles. The choice of judges as defendants is perfect - as spelled out in a remarkable speech by the prosecutor, these men were well educated and mature when the Third Reich began to make a mockery of the rule of law. And yet, they consented to serve within this warped legal system that degraded them from independent servants of justice to accessories in crimes against humanity.",
211,18 May 2006,markmahong,10, An excellent movie,"I just watched the movie and didn't know it is so good! The opposing opinions of the prosecutor and the defense are pretty much balanced without giving either side's arguments an overwhelmingly convincing edge. The four judges are found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. However, Dan, the presiding judge, says at the end of movie that nothing on this earth is both logical and right, which hints that he has to come to this verdict and sentences though he thinks it is not absolutely fair to the former Nazi judges. The movie starts with a famous Nazi song ""Wenn Wir marchieren,..."" a military march famous during the reign of the Third Reich. The purpose is unknown, but a few lines of ""Lili Marlene"" in the middle of the movie are beautiful, especially with the explanation of Mrs. Berthold---The soldier is going to the front and he knows he is going to lose the girl and the life he loves.",
212,9 December 2021,XY43137,8," Powerful, but no one is listening.","Powerful performances. Powerful points. The sentencing is not the important part.

213,30 November 2007,christian_gil88,10, A disturbing and thought-provoking masterpiece,"Of the large output of movies that concern themselves with accounts of the Nazi era and its aftermath, there are perhaps only a handful that can be called 'great'. This is certainly one of them. This film is about the (fictional) tribunal of 4 of the German judges, who 'legalised' the atrocities enshrined in the so-called 'Nuremberg Laws' and were swayed by political rather than legal considerations when making their judgements. By 1948, there was increasing political pressure for the trials to cease. Germany was becoming regarded as a bastion against the threat of communism from the East. As one character in this film remarks : 'You do not get help from the German people if you constantly keep putting their leaders on trial.' Spencer Tracey plays the principal judge, who is determined that the tribunal shall go ahead, and makes every effort to understand how such terrible events could occur in a 'civilised' country. As the trial progresses we are shown, not just from witnesses brought in and the courtroom drama itself, (and very dramatic it is), a country that permitted the most horrendous crimes to be committed in its name, now shamed and defeated, trying to regain a semblance of normality and self-respect. All seven principals (The cast list reads like a Hollywood who's who) give stunning performances and the direction by Stanley Kramer makes for an unforgettable experience.",
214,1 April 2023,capncack-71131,8, Over the top but well worth watching,"Younger viewers would perhaps find the black and white, as well as the slower pace, difficult. However, this movie is well worth viewing for the excellent performances from several of the actors, particularly Dietrich and Tracy. For my part I found Schell's performance too over the top to be anything but melodramatic, nor did I find his arguments logically compelling (maybe the whole world is guilty, but only these four people were at trial, and a real judge would have shut him down), but I guess the Oscars found it otherwise. This movie finds a good middle ground between demonizing al Germans and letting them all off the hook.",
215,12 June 2015,gdematties,8, An acting seminar...,"An all-star cast delivers top notch performances in Stanley Kramer's excellent courtroom drama, ""Judgement At Nuremburg"". Maximilian Schell is a revelation in his Oscar-winning turn as the defense counsel for four German judges being tried for war crimes during the Third Reich's reign in Germany.The judges are charged with handing out morally wrong convictions handed down to citizens who opposed the state, or were politically affiliated with parties who opposed the Nazis, and then passing cruel sentences to those citizens, which included women and children. Heinous punishments which included sentences to concentration camps, sterilization of citizens and mass executions are discussed at great length. Kramer gets superb performances out of Montgomery Cliff and the great Judy Garland, as broken victims of these verdicts. It includes messages of how the military establishment will continue to repeat mistakes of the past, as well as the message to the whole world that we should never forget the sins of war, whether it affects millions, or one human life. A powerful film, whose 3 hour length flies by as the drama grips you.",
216,13 June 2012,firozhossainchaudhuri,10, riveting!!,"One of the greatest films ever made. A superlative piece of work. To think, that an American director made this atrociously spellbinding film in those times is remarkable in itself. Pointing fingers in the right direction can not be done in a manner better than this. This was a film that just had to be made. It asks the kind of questions which to my knowledge are not even considered in most circles, the topic itself being taboo. Since the World Wars American hegemony has only grown worse and it is no surprise that such a masterpiece is hardly if ever, talked about. I am familiar with the Director's oeuvre having seen 'Inherit The wind' most notably, but this work is much more than just a film. It is a monumental achievement. This film is profoundly accurate, be it in terms of history or in acting. Each of the actors is brilliant, there being not a single letup anywhere in terms of intensity or mood or anything of the sort. The film is much more than just a courtroom drama, it is a trial for justice with the defendants being, the World at large. Highly recommended.",
217,5 March 2022,mikestone1948,10, Great Moral Question. Where Does the Buck Stop?,"Despite its title, this film is not about the war crimes trials of 1945/6, which tried and condemned the top Nazis.

219,28 January 2013,dutch7219,10, Expectted excellence,"Having a predominately German side of the family and a best friend with fathers that fought on both sides we come across films like this and choose to watch them together. Judgement Day (the film) is a fictional account of some actual events. His mother and grandmother told tales of the horrors, and the blessings until the party rule. During my time in Derfatherland, I can say I was only happy to see cousins and relatives still living in the ancestral villages. Found my great great Grandfathers grave at the Luthern church. It is special and the people are by in large special. The film captures much of the spirit of the people. We may be defeated but we are not lost. Many of the convicted had sentences revoked, or repealed. Some are apologetic about what when on. Some have no true understanding. The issues at hand in this film is the judiciary liable for carrying out the sentences as described in the laws of the land. From watching it, I can see both points, Maximillion Schell did an outstanding job. I think it pretty easy to see how many rights you'll let slide comfortably before you realize that reform is the only way change will occur. Once there is a nation a sheep there are no wolves for the Sheppard to watch out for.",

222,6 February 2011,cazonaquest,10, An outstanding Film,"I don't know why I have never seen this film before. As an actress and writer myself, it is quite an oversight on my part, now rectified. The film offers a complex and thoughtful screenplay by Abby Mann on the subject of moral and social responsibility within Nazi Germany. It is also unveils shockingly how easy it is to lie to oneself and puts into question the necessity of passing judgement if it betters suits the time and circumstances to be lenient. Kramer has drawn from a first rate cast some of the finest screen performances I have ever seen. Montgomery Clift's cameo is mesmerising. As are the performances of Maximilian Schell, Spencer Tracy and Burt Lancaster. Stanley Kramer as director and Ernest Lazlo as superb cinematographer have never been better. It has left me quite shaken. Unforgettable.",
223,15 August 2015,linuxnutcase1,10, Wonderful film must see for the Lover of Liberty,"This film is above most films made, it has not adventure no actions not pictures of lovely ladies. But it contains something much more important, justice. This film may or may not be a totally true story. Although if it was totally true it would carry more merit. What is does show has more merit then almost all the words our of people on TV today, for the most part. The judges in the film had to judge people who were right in their own land. The judges showed though that we as humans are responsible to a much higher power. Some called it God, whatever it is there is laws above all society and governments which every one is responsible for and their actions against. This film address that problem in much more detail, with much drama. And even shows pictures and films of the terrible operations of the concentration camps. A part of history we don't see enough of by a long shot. It makes each of us think of our own lives and what we stand for. Over all this is truly a must see film, for all, I would strongly say every school kid needs this in their education.",

This movie is from an era when the United States had superlatives actors and directors. Stanley Kramer did a movie about Americans that was not a good (americans) vs evil (everybody else) film. There is something here that we cannot almost never find in American cinema nowadays, and it is call subtlety. All the actors are great, and as good Yves Simoneau is, his 2000 version would have been better with Spencer Tracy, Marlene Dietrich, Richard Widmark and Maximilian Schell. This movie belongs in the top 10 of all time, along with the Schindler's List.",
227,11 June 2005,geoffreynuelle,10, An important film for all future generations to see if we are to avoid the mistakes made in the thirties in Germany,The film is a fairly faithful portrayal of one of the Nuremburg trials. It presents some hard choices for the viewer because we are invited to sit in judgement on the defendants and also to criticise the possible hypocrisy between the defendants and their judges. It really is a film that everyone should see.,
