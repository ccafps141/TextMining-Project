0,15 January 2004,the-evil-cult,10, Entertaining and Thought-Provoking.,"Of the 250+ films I've seen and rated on IMDb, only one other (Schindler's List) is as good as American Beauty. A film like this not only entertains while you're in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality. After watching this movie, viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them. The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can't really grasp.",/
1,29 May 2000,RueMorgue,10, An Oscar well deserved.,"This film is one of a kind.  After seeing this film last week, I was left with a hole in the pit of my stomach.  It left many questions in my mind, and most of them cannot be answered. In my view, a film that makes me think after I watch it is second-to-none, and this film certainly delivers in that aspect.",r
2,14 August 2001,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, An American Masterpiece,"This is by far one of the best, if not THE, movies of the 90's.

5,26 February 2000,ryan_lynch,10, A little masterpiece...,"""American Beauty"" is tour de force cinema. Sam Mendes' brilliant debut feature depicts a web of characters who yearn for their own 'American Dream' - yet, in the end, only one character truly attains it.",e
6,29 November 2003,Philip_Pugh,10, Beautiful...,Probably the best film of 1999. This dark comedy drama marks two fantastic feature film debuts with Alan Ball as writer and Sam Mendes as director (both winning oscars for their sterling efforts).,w
7,12 November 2007,uhmartinez-phd,10, Close To Perfection,"The intention is so clear that everything else falls into place, perfectly. Kevin Spacey's suburban husband and father reminded me of his character in ""The Ref"" and that could only be a good thing. Annette Bening and her giggle works wonders here. Their marriage is a tabloid version of a ""Who's Afraid To Virginia Woolf"" Which means very close to someone we know. The biggest surprises in the film. besides the amazing dexterity of Sam Mendes at his first outing behind the camera, are West Bentley. Chris Cooper, Thora Brch and Allison Janney. As I'm writing this 8 years after its first release, the Oscars and the whole hullabaloo, I'm very surprised that West Bentley hasn't become a major star. He is amazing in ""American Beauty"" the complexities of his character are based on recognizable human stands, the hardest to face up to and I went where he went. Thora Birch is lovely as the object of his attention and the film, I believe, is here to say.",/
8,5 November 1999,The Woof,10, One of my faves of the year...simply great.,"This movie was a joy to watch.  I didn't know what to expect when I came into it.

10,7 July 2001,reesew18,10, a very well done film that continues to amaze me...,"When I first saw this movie in theaters, I found it to be very funny. When I rented it at home, I found it to be very sad and complex. Looking at it now, I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched, or maybe too un-ordinary to be worthy of its praise, but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After you've seen it, you know you've seen something.",0
11,14 December 1999,bootsy-4,10, Far and away the best film of the year,"What can I say, except that this film really knocked me on my keaster.  I went in to the theater not knowing what to expect, but was pretty sure it would be worth the ticket price.  Boy was I happy when I left.  Not only was it worth the ticket, I paid to see this film two more times.  This film is virtually perfect.  The acting is superb, the story is magnificent, the narrative is brilliant, and the structure of the film is truly groundbreaking (absolutely loved the last 20 minutes).  What really surprised me about this film was how well the cinematography was done.  In a small, character driven film such as this, it is very unusual to have such great cinematography.  With this film, there is something interesting going on in every scene, not many films you can say that about.  In a year where first time directors have made some of the best films, Three Kings, Being John Malkovich, etc...  Sam Mendes seems to have out-done them all.  Though I have yet to see The Green Mile or Magnolia, I find it hard to believe that either film will out-shine American Beauty.  This film should easily win a substantial amount of the Oscars this year.  What's up with all the cirtics awards snubbing it so far?",9
12,21 October 2004,Galina_movie_fan,10, My Favorite Film From the 90s,"American Beauty is a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" film, and you never know if it has more 'love it' or 'hate it' viewers. Personally, I love it -from the first sight, from the last sight, from the eternal sight. It is my favorite film of the 90s, one of my personal twenty favorites ever. I think that American Beauty is an instant classic, and it will stay that way as long as people watch movies.",6
13,19 April 2022,gsh999,10, Perfectly captures the dystopia of the USA at the turn of the millenia,"Greed and hate has destroyed the fabric of society in the USA and this film depicts a broken family that could be millions of families in suburban USA. I often think acting doesn't take much skill but movies like American Beauty help me appreciate truly fine acting. The film shows how one man finds redemption by breaking out of the cage his life had become. Despite a tragedy, the film ends on a positive note with the narration of the central character. One of my top 5 favorite movies. Congratulations to everyone who took part in the making of this movie.",8
14,12 November 2007,Pulpthatsfiction,10, Look Closer...,"The first time I heard about this movie I thought it was this movie and about a man with cancer and then read a lot of good things about and then say some trailers and then I saw it. At first I did not like this movie but than say it again on T.V and then loved it ever since. This is one of the most original films I have ever seen. The performances are one of the best and more Oscars should have been handed out. The directing by Sam Mendes is superb and I'm glad that he won the Oscar. Alan Ball wrote one of the best screenplay and story's ever thought and there's a reason why he won the Oscar and most deserving. This is the Best of the 1990's and that decade had a lot of great movies came out( Goodfellas, L.A Confedintil, Pulp Fiction to name a few). This was the first movie that I saw that was perfect and I had to see it over and over so I can just uncover everything that was in this movie. This movie is in my top ten movies of all time and I'm glad that it's rank number 35 and that one of the reason why I joined this because it was the only website people respect my opinions and agreed with me. Keven Spacey gives his best performance and one of the best of time. Spacey brings a great performance for a really deep and is just a great character. Annette Bening does a great and for some reason missed the Oscar. Chris Copper does a great job and didn't get notice that much, also did Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari and thora Birch did a great job and should have more notice. Sam Mendes does a great directing job and is one the best film debut ever. This film was one the best ever made and should be seen by everyone hows looking for great movie or how just want have fun watching a movie.",8

16,13 June 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Mayn't be the most original movie I have seen, but it is still an outstanding movie","I wasn't expecting to like American Beauty, but I did, loved it more like. The story mayn't be original at first glance, but how the film is written and constructed more than compensates you completely overlook. You may argue the characters are weird and unlikeable, maybe so, but they are quite complex. Lester is a self-described loser who is unwanted by everyone, Carolyn is uptight and sexually frustrated, Jane is the epitome of a sulky teenage daughter and Allison is like a incipient Lolita who Lester becomes smitten with. American Beauty is probably an example of a movie that you may need to see more than once to truly appreciate it, I was like that with Vertigo.",3

19,21 October 2019,UniqueParticle,10, My 600th review on IMDb and such a perfect movie for it!,"Makes me smile at so many scenes, well deserving of the 5 Oscars! The writing and emotions are exquisitely powerful yet somber. I absolutely love Kevin Spacey despite his personal life troubles and Annette Benning blows me out of the water every time. I'm delighted to own such a piece of art on Blu-Ray; American Beauty has been among my top favorites for a very long time I'd say number 8. The Soundtrack is one of the greatest things ever, to me this film is like a perfect tapestry after using the paint brush and Sam Mendes created it so well! Hope my thoughts aren't to over the top I just very much enjoy this movie!",r
20,11 August 2006,kenjha,6, American Ugly,"Much-praised film about a man facing mid-life crisis in suburbia, dreaming of playing Humbert Humbert to a Lolita that is his daughter's friend. There is only one word to describe this film: pretentious. Mendes thinks he is making the Great American Motion Picture but it is populated with cookie-cutter characters and it superficially touches on what the filmmakers regard as important themes. The acting is mediocre at best. Spacey gives the kind of performance that the Academy loves and awarded him with the Oscar but his acting here can be best described as mugging. Benning does not fare much better as his desperate wife.",e

23,13 October 2020,PCC0921,9, The best of 1999.,"In an interesting shout-out to Sunset BLVD you already know the fate of the main character, played wonderfully by Kevin Spacey, as soon as the beginning credits end. This is an excellent film. The best from 1999 and well worth the Best Picture Award it got from the Academy that year. This is a great exploration of life and the hang-ups that accompany it. Spacey's character is a clown, but a person we can all relate to. Taboos are covered, like voyeurism by the daughter's boyfriend, the relationship that develops between Spacey and a young 17 year old girl and homosexuality that appears at the most unlikely time. Chris Cooper plays a tormented father who has no real idea who he really is. A great play on the misinterpretation on feelings too. An excellent commentary on the mid-life crisis phenomenon. The film travels along with a wonderful soundtrack. Oh! There also is a Scott Bakula sighting.",=
24,6 November 2012,asda-man,10, Beautiful!,"The first time I saw ""American Beauty"" was when I was around 8 years old so it's a hazy memory. Unfortunately I had to go to bed about 40 minutes in, but some scenes have stayed with me since (I'm 17 now). The second time I saw American Beauty was on the eve of my blonde friend's birthday party (I must've been around 15) and I was totally gripped. Unfortunately I had to force myself to bed as it was on late, and left 40 minutes in, in order to be awake-looking for the early morning start the next day. Yesterday, I finally got the chance to see American Beauty the whole way through. And it was amazing.",t
25,6 April 2021,thedanny-10831,9, Pure poetry,"This film is not only about American Beauty, but also about the full concept of beauty, which concerns everybody. This deep theme is able to trap us into the story and make us feel the same feelings of the protagonist. The movie has a clear message: don't waste your time believing you're not going to make the difference in some way, get out, look around you and discover the spark that makes you feel at the highest level of your life. This is how I think of it. Sam Mendes, at his debut, already scored and the acotrs' performances were among the best of the decade. And you also find the poetry especially in the music by the incredible and underrated Thomas Newman.",t
26,31 December 2015,BA_Harrison,10, For anyone who has ever wondered what the future might hold or questioned what could have been.,"Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), 42, has spent years trapped in an unhappy marriage and an unsatisfying job. His relationship with his teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is almost as strained as that with his career-driven realtor wife Carolyn (Annette Bening). When Lester becomes infatuated with his daughter's friend Angela (Mena Suvari), it marks the beginning of a severe mid-life crisis that sees him revisiting the carefree ways of his youth, but at a cost.",_
27,5 February 2012,classicsoncall,10," ""Never underestimate the power of denial.""","I've read a number of the pro and con reviews of this movie and in a strange way, both sides of the argument seem to have it right. Perhaps that's the power of the film, it's ability to present opposing viewpoints as if they were two sides of the same coin. Personally, I thought the film was brilliant in it's portrayal of how vapid society has become in it's examination of wealth, success and having to get it right here and right now. That's where the Annette Bening character comes in, as the self-actualizing real estate salesperson measuring success by projecting the appearance of success. Caricaturing that position is her husband's (Kevin Spacey) complete disconnect from reality by blackmailing his employer, quitting his job, and looking for the least possible amount of responsibility in a burger flipping career. Along the way, Lester Burnham entertains grand delusions of buffing up and following through on his mid-life fantasies while those around him, daughter Janie (Thora Birch), Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) and creepy neighbor Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley) all dance to the different drummer in their own lives.",u
28,11 July 2011,planktonrules,8," Provocative, unique and well-crafted....but not exactly pleasant viewing.","""American Beauty"" earned five Oscars--including the biggie for Best Picture. However, I can't help but think that it just couldn't live up this hype when I watched it. Perhaps the competition just wasn't that great, but I can think of a lot of films that should have won this many awards but didn't. Perhaps you don't agree...and hey, that's life.",r
29,25 September 1999,DTL,10, One of the Best films of 1999!!,"A definite addition to my Ten Best List for 1999,  is AMERICAN BEAUTY which is sure to earn Kevin Spacey, Annette Benning  (robbed in the past for her work in BUGSY and THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT),  and Alan Ball (most original screenplay to come along in awhile), Oscar nominations. It is the story of what suburban life and the pursuit of the American Dream can do to an American Family. But unlike the critic's darling from a few years ago ICE STORM, which left me freezing, this film is genuinely funny and moving at the same time. The ideas projected by director Sam Mendes literally leap off the screen.  Spacey's edgy performance as the ad exec pushed over the brink by the pressures of having to have it all and his passion for ""The American Beauty""  he missed when he was young enough to enjoy it, offer a visual feast.  Annette Benning as the Queen of suburbia, Spacey's wife, is  a sort sexy, gorgeous, Martha Stewart gone mad, convinced if she has just one more motivational seminar she will reach nirvana.  She is in a word ""wonderful."" The boy next door is sort of cross between Timothy Hutton in ORDINARY PEOPLE and Benjamin in THE GRADUATE.  He deals drugs, observes life around him through a video camera and convinces almost everyone that he is the straight arrow next door.  We know immediately, that like everyone else in this movie, he is not as he appears.  AMERICAN BEAUTY peals away, layer by layer, this oh so imperfect world of suburbia and those in denial who live there. If you have already seen NOTTING HILL you NEED to see AMERICAN BEAUTY.",v
30,12 July 2020,marmar-69780,8, american beauty,"American beauty is a well good shown and represanted life of family that has a lot of problems in it and how they are trying to work around them and somehow trying it to fix them,i would say this this movie had some strong messages in it also,about how fast life can past fast and how regret about making some decisions can have a big mark and effect on us in a future and take a big toll on us,spacey for me give performance of lifetime here and for me he may be one of those actors that are able to put them selfs in a very difficult roles but somehow act like that is the easiest mission in a world,rest of cast werent on his level,except chris cooper but they were solid in their roles,american beauty was sometimes depressing movie but it had some really strong staff and messages in it",
31,4 June 2020,aidanratesmovies,10," Perfect, in every sense of the word","If I had to describe this film in one word, it would be 'brilliant.' Nothing has truly captured the mundane and inner thoughts and demons surrounding people and their human natures quite like this before, nor has any film been able to play it off in such a unique manner. It's a timeless film that somehow manages to be incredibly insightful, without ever feeling a slight bit dull or boring. It's interesting, entertaining, cleverly shot, well written, and fantastically acted. There is little to say the film didn't do right. Kevin Spacey gives one of, if not, the best performance of his career and he is well deserving of his Oscar win. His portrayal of the character Lester Burnham can often be imitated in many aspiring filmmakers works today, but even though it is often imitated, none can replicate the brilliance that Spacey puts into the performance. His acting is not only realistic, but also endlessly enjoyable to watch, and you won't want to take your eyes off the screen when he steals every scene he possibly can. The other actors in the film are quite great as well. Annette Bening gives a wonderfully poignant performance as Carolyn Burnham and provides a greater glimpse into the struggling suburban wife we have all come to know at some point in our lives. Her performance isn't just an advance on a stereotype however, and neither is the character, but rather a fresh perspective on how someone so mundane and yet trouble-filled can be living throughout their own life. Though no performance in the film shine quite as notably as these two; Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari, and Chris Cooper all give quite notable performances on their own- with somewhat less screen time to let their roles shine. The film is written beautifully, and its incite and story is so incredibly down to earth- and yet so wonderfully magical all at once. It's direction is perfect, with it being Mendes' first effort, it truly shows how impressive he is as a filmmaker. The film is also shot beautifully, and is well deserved of its Oscar win for cinematography, with its endlessly perfect and interesting shots that truly help the film to keep up its amazing stature. The one flaw I can see the film being ridiculed for, is it being slightly predictable at times, but even with this small flaw- American Beauty seems to make it not just a flaw but a quirk of its story- by providing such realistic values and lifelike scenarios- that you can't help but feel like if you were in the same situation, you could predict it yourself. In the end, American Beauty is a timeless effort from all those involved- filled with some wonderful writing by Alan Ball and wonderful direction from Sam Mendes. Spacey's performance, as is the film, is timeless and all in all both go in my personal favorite moments in all of film history.
My Rating: 10/10",
32,28 December 2022,fernandoschiavi,9," The harsh consequences of our contemporary society, shows how fear is the main culprit of trying to keep up appearances and not accepting ourselves as we really are","American Beauty is a chronicle about ordinary people living through relatively ordinary dramas and that, in a way, end up reaching equally ordinary conclusions. Perhaps this is precisely the secret of the film, which, at the end of the projection, manages to lead us to curiously intense emotions: the fact that its message is universal. How to avoid identifying with a man as normal as the one played by Kevin Spacey? Directed by Sam Mendes, following the routine of a group of ordinary citizens, the plot portrays a family in the process of breaking up. Lester (Kevin Spacey) and Carolyn's (Annette Bening) marriage is a sea of coldness and arguments. Suddenly, he starts fantasizing about Angela (Mena Suvari), a teenager who is his daughter's friend. From then on, the protagonist makes major changes in his life that end tragically.",
33,24 March 2004,majikstl,2, Anti-American Beauty,"They live in the suburbs, therefore they are losers.",
34,10 September 2021,nickenchuggets,8," ""You don't get to tell me what to do ever again""","As is often the case with relatively new films, American Beauty has to be one of the most provocative movies I've seen in a long while. I don't really know why, but cursing in old movies is pretty much unheard of, at least up until the mid 60s when that was changed. I say this because this movie is technically a comedy/drama, but is profoundly depressing for the most part. Just like Ghost World, there is a comedic element to it but the profanity makes you mostly forget about that. I feel it's no coincidence either that Thora Birch from Ghost World is also in this movie. The story is about a middle aged, seemingly ordinary guy named Lester (Kevin Spacey) and how unhappy he is with life, so he does something about it. The first few minutes, narrated by him, explain that his family thinks he's a total loser, and they're basically correct. He is constantly the butt of jokes made by his wife Carolyn and daughter Jane (Thora Birch), and is typically overlooked whenever he tries to participate in conversations. One day, a retired Marine Corps officer named colonel Fitts moves in next to Lester, and his son Ricky quickly becomes one of the movie's strangest (and most important) characters. The first time Jane notices him, he's filming her with a video camera with a blank expression on his face. This leads Jane and her promiscuous cheerleading friend Angela (Mena Suvari) to regard him as a schizophrenic, and as it turns out, his father has once sent him to a mental hospital. One night as Lester attends a cheerleading event to please his daughter, he has a very odd hallucination in which all the other girls disappear and his gaze is fixated on Angela alone. After the show, Jane urges her father to go home because she thinks her friend will be embarrassed by his wimpy and unkempt appearance. Secretly though, Angela finds him attractive. Some time after this, Lester suddenly stops caring about making progress in his life because everyone around him never has anything good to say about him. He blackmails his boss into giving him unemployment money, loses his job, buys a 1970 Firebird, and even starts smoking marijuana he secretly buys from Ricky. As stated earlier, Ricky is a strange kid to say the least but his father is extremely strict. Despite this, he's able to use his job as a smokescreen for dealing weed. Meanwhile, Angela and Jane are starting to become more alienated from each other because Jane has started to become attracted to Ricky, even though he was spying on her half naked earlier. After going to Ricky's house one day, they sneak into his father's office so that Ricky can show off a dinnerplate his father owns with a swastika painted on it. Concurrently, Carolyn is starting to get more frustrated by her husband's indolent new attitude and starts to cheat on him. Lester does not care, but as his new friendship and drug partnership with Ricky continues, he indirectly gets him into serious trouble. Because Ricky films almost everything with his camcorder, he filmed a shirtless Lester weightlifting one day by accident. Once Ricky's father discovers this, he barges into his son's room and brutally beats him under the false assumption he is gay. Not only this, but he also found out Ricky broke into his office to show Jane the nazi plate. Ricky's father tells him he'd rather see his son dead than gay, and Ricky lies to him and says he is, allowing his father to throw him out of the house. After getting rid of Ricky, colonel Fitts goes next door to Lester's garage, seemingly to start a fight. When the door lifts up, Lester just rebuffs him, and Fitts doesn't respond. By now, Ricky is trying to figure out what to do with his life now that his father doesn't want him anymore. He decides to go to Lester's house to talk to Jane, encouraging her to come to New York with him. Angela is enraged at the thought of her friend leaving for some drug addict, and voices her concerns to Ricky, who calls her ugly and vapid. Ricky and Jane leave, and Angela, deeply hurt by his comments, goes into Lester's living room to be alone. When Lester goes back in his house, he sees her waiting there, and finally gets to say what he wanted to ever since he first saw her. He says how beautiful she is, and the two become more acquainted because both now have difficult lives. Finally, Angela says she likes him back, and this puts Lester in such a good mood it seems like his mid-life crisis is over. As he stares at an old picture of him, his wife, and his daughter, an unidentified person (probably Carolyn) sneaks up behind him and puts a gun to his head. After having his brains blown out, Jane finds her dead father, appearing to be indifferent. Although he is dead, Lester's narration continues, and he says he can't be angry at being killed because the world has so much beauty. Widely considered the best movie to be released in 1999, I thought this was a pretty overblown statement. This movie is good, but quite disturbing for a ""comedy"". Yes I know it's supposed to be black humor, but it has the same problem that Ghost World had for me, that being the situations are too relatable. Spacey's character is portrayed as a meek, pathetic and frequently ignored person who just allows everyone to talk over him at all times. I hate to say this, but I've been in many situations like that, and when I see it in a movie, I just cringe. There's also the plot hole (if you can call it that) towards the end where Jane actually accepts Ricky's invitation to leave her old life behind and go to New York. I don't know about you, but the thought of a teenage girl dropping out of school to live with a drug dealer doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Ricky does already say his parents won't care if he dies. Thora Birch is one of the weirdest characters, since the first time she interacts with Ricky has her giving him the finger for filming her without permission. Later on though, she starts to like him more and more, even to the point of willingly undressing in front of her window for him. Right after, Ricky's father bursts into his room and beats him. In my opinion, Ghost World and this film have many similarities. They are both awkward to watch, meant to make the viewer feel embarrassed, and both feature Thora Birch as a social outcast. I also thought the intentionally ironic part toward the end where Angela is revealed to be a virgin was predictable. The filmmakers wanted to include a bit of irony by having the promiscuous cheerleader be one. In any case, American Beauty is surely an experience. Even though I don't think it earns such an amazing reputation, at least it made me think.",
35,18 February 2019,ohlabtechguy,6, Hollywood derives entertainment value from mental illness....,"Here we have yet another highly polished Hollywood flick that seeks to derive entertainment value by depicting two suburban families loaded with mental illness and/or behavioral disorders. Yet, the subject of mental disorders is not addressed and therefore, no meaningful message is given. Instead, the mainstream audience, not fully aware of signs of mental illness, are led to believe that characters with all the signs of mental disorder, are merely quirky, eccentric and at worst dysfunctional. Not a movie I would recommend and no meaningful message given. Hollywood just doesn't get it.",

The entire cast was great, including Chris Cooper as a closeted homosexual and the young Wes Bentley as an abnormal deceiver. While the infamous ""plastic bag"" scene both awful and stupid, pretty much everything else was fantastic. From the Smiley's discovery to the disturbing videos Ricky shot, pretty much all of the movie is important, interesting and quite thought-provoking. And what I think to be the best part: the lack of a resolution. Since the movie is from Lester's POV, it makes sense that he wouldn't know how it ended.

44,24 February 2000,Oro-Indiano,1, The greatest trick Kevin Spacey ever pulled...,"Kevin Spacey is a genius, or at least a veritable magician.  A couple of the folks with whom I saw ""American Beauty"" said afterwards: ""It was great - Spacey was incredible.""  His performance, it seems, is enough to have convinced people that they had just watched a decent movie, even though there is little else to recommend the film.  The other significant plus is the advertising campaign - marketing it as ""a funny drama"" and ""a moving comedy"" is an ingenious way of disguising the fact that it is neither. Since there are only two or three really good laughs in the piece it isn't really funny enough to be a comedy (but since it's written by someone who used to work on ""Cybill"", that's hardly a surprise) and since it only gets vaguely dramatic towards the end, it doesn't maintain the atmosphere of a ""drama"".  But the audience happily accepts this schizophrenic mess because the adverts told them to.  The adverts also told them to ""Look closer"". Again, this is a tip-top marketing ploy, since it implies hidden depth, significance and meaning, without the content actually being there.  The average audience member is going to think ""Wow, that plastic bag blowing around must be really poignant, because this is a DEEP movie.""  Heaven forbid that they should actually think for themselves.  Look closer, indeed.",

For all their flaws people are basically beautiful and that is one of the many threads of the fabric of this film.  I liked that it was revealed at the start of the film that Lester would soon meet his demise.  And I also liked at the ending, the identity of the person who took his life didn't really matter, just the sadness of the loss of his life.  'Look Closer' was the theme of this movie and Lester even had this motto in his cubical.  Kevin assumed the persona of Lester with a range of acting that is quite worthy of awards.  Bening inhabited Carolyn in much the same way.  Which one of us hasn't experienced the disillusionment of our teenage years, only to later re-experienced it again through our children.  And like Carolyn, who among us has not been intensely disappointed with ourself at some point?  That one scene was amazing, it looked so real that it transcended acting.  And can a movie actually move beyond entertainment by causing more than absorbing discussion, but real change in it's audience?  Perhaps.  But if this is true, then that movie would be American Beauty.  And for those who feel this movie doesn't achieve this lofty accolade.  To them I say, ""Never underestimate the power of denial.""

At times it is a biting satire with sharp wit and acute observations, at other times it is a deep drama about unhappy individuals in American suburbia, but all the time I found it an enjoyable film to view, both because of the things it has to say and the high cinematic quality of the production. ",
52,15 October 2020,cwbellor,8," ""I rule!"" Do you? Do you though?","Suburban life isn't all rose petals, jail bait cheerleaders and gay neo-nazis in the closet! Something much darker lies beneath the veneer and whatever it is, it's not only dark, it's beautiful. American Beauty is a mid-life crisis tale that's heavy on the men's lib message.
Spacey gives his I'm-so-bored drawl and every word he utters conveys the cynical sarcastic disdain he feels for the world. But his performance is not without levity. Watch him as he says, ""I rule."" It's fantastically subtle. Subtle in a look-at-how-funny-that-is way. When he finally begins to assert himself, it is remarkably poignant. Watch him throw asparagus against the wall. No, it's not a potential precursor to domestic violence. It's a declaration of independence whereupon you happily applaud Spacey's descent into me-me-me world. Meanwhile, his daughter Missy Miserable, played by Thora Birch is committed to the dead stare demeanor. Her only guide as she navigates the teenage wasteland is blonde bimbo Jenny Jailbait. Thora is a disillusioned youth in need of a more thoughtful peer. Enter the eccentric and creepy Ricky Fitts. As far as Ricky is concerned, Mena is a bland blonde and Thora is a glowing angel of tortured teendom.
Ricky is an immediately endearing character for the fact that he appears to have been born with a paralyzing birth defect - the inability to blink. Ricky's sole purpose in life is to mock the stuffy suburbanite pursuit of perfection. This is something he can do simply by standing in one place without blinking. Observe his psycho-killer stare as he balances sincerity with pretentious existential insights. The epic plastic bag dance is so stunning that wide-eyed Ricky feels like he might pass out from its beauty. For Ricky, a plastic bag is a bigger tearjerker than Lester's morning grip in the shower.",

57,30 March 2006,Hitchcoc,8, Obsessions can be deadly,"Ahh, the joys of middle age. I remember a day at work, when a customer referred to an old gray haired guy who had waited on him. I didn't know who he was talking about; then it dawned on me; he was talking about me. Middle aged men, like Kevin Spacey, do have these fantasies from time to time. The girl in question is so unapproachable and so unconquerable, it should never have been an issue. In the meantime, we have the guy next door, with the hangups and his sexual identity issues. It's a sick mix. It's intriguing, but who would want to be there? Of course, marriages begin to fall apart, people begin to try to be what they are not, and the dominoes start to tumble with great dispatch. Someone is going to get hurt; someone may even die. Like Gene Wilder in ""The Woman in Red"" if our lives ended right now, it may be worth it. Unfortunately, tomorrow is another day. What were we thinking? Is this bravery or foolishness or madness or hormones or what? The sense of betrayal that filters through everything puts a pall over the ether. ",

I've mentioned that the first half of the film was somewhat slow and ponderous. The second half was much better. The second half of the film has a darker edge to it and it finally seemed like the film was starting to make an attempt at social commentary. The character plot twists admittedly were somewhat predictable, I still liked the way that many of the characters became sort of an 'anti-cliche' in the end. This is a tough one for me as the film does have a mix of good and bad. If the first half of the film had been as good as the second half then I would have enjoyed it a lot more, but the lack of focus and general cringe inducing first half meant it wasn't an easy ride getting to the much more enjoyable second half.

It's nothing more than an overblown, exaggerated view of a dysfunctional family set to the backdrop of a suburban lifestyle that, for the most part, seems totally unrealistic. While Kevin Spacey usually turns in consistent performances (although he always seems to play rather offbeat characters), I felt his performance here was very weak. He plays a middle-aged man going through his midlife crisis period but to me, just seems unconvincing. Even Annette Benning's performance seemed way below par.

68,10 October 1999,Adrian-32,10, One of the year's finest,"Watching ""American Beauty"" is like looking into a handful of American lives slowly plunging into moral and emotional devastation. Although these people are gaining a sincerely fulfilling happiness, they are also slowly losing their grip on human value and order. This is not your average social commentary, it has something most satires lack; poignancy. On one hand, this is a scathing examination of the facades and truths that surround a seemingly ""perfect"" suburban family, displaying what it would be like if everyone's true colours emerged, as they liberate themselves from the painful phoniness that society forces them to live by. One the other hand, ""American Beauty"" is a thought-provoking and emotionally devastating character study of two families finally achieving joy for the first time in their lives, unaware of the profound impact they are having on themselves and each other, and neglecting the consequences that will inevitably follow. ""American Beauty"" shines in almost everyway, from it's stunning imagery of beauty fused with violence and tragedy, to it's darkly hilarious script, this is one of those rare films that stay with you for a long time. But the main thing that makes this movie soar are the performances, Kevin Spacey and Anette Benning are simply sensational as the feuding married couple exploring new realms of life,  Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Mena Suvari and Thora Birch also showcase excellent performances.

There are an astonishing number of themes that are each explored and strongly supported by the cinematography, and that makes this film different each time you watch it. I chose to recognize authenticity and redemption as the central themes, especially considering the 'look closer' tagline. The smart and subtle uses of color support several themes, but are also subliminally subversive. The cinematography in American Beauty and the myriad goals it accomplishes are nothing short of genius and quite nearly mind control. Mendes' direction here is a staple of self-control and fearlessness in Hollywood. Spacey's performance was shockingly powerful and resonant. Everything just works, even the mishaps. My only caveat: with so many themes, it feels as though they are wrestling for attention. I felt forced to focus on the satirical aspect of the film, which becomes lacking. It's not that the film is beyond comprehension, rather the themes begin to contradict one another, producing a sort of unwanted chaotic element that is detrimental to the greater lessons to be learned. But the achievements in American Beauty cannot be ignored. You can spend days watching this film, trying to wrap your head around the beautiful meaning of life that it presents you with.

That's because most of the scenes (including a misuse of shampoo in the shower) are completely over-the-top. The director should have cut out any dramatic pretenses and went with a Zucker-Abrams-Zucker comedy concept.

Then, he buys a sports car, smokes ""100% safe weed,"" and hates his life as it is, until he re-discovers ""puppy love."" Good for him?

So why don't I give it a 1 out of 10? To tell you the truth, it's because the film is very clever in the way that it goes about fooling people into believing that this is some sort of deep, artistic, multi-layered critique of modern suburban life with strong messages.

Example: after their epiphany with the paper/trash and Spacey's death, the two kids look coldly at the dead father and then turn to trash the cheerleader on their way out the door. What sort of humanity or beauty is there in this? Suvari turns out to be the only humane character in the flick, and these two droids tell her SHE'S got problems/is essentially trash? Please. If you listen to the director's comments, you hear that their actions are supposed to be the closing of a circle of sorts. I.e. The boy again sees beauty in an unlikely place. Again, please.

And Annette Benning, oh wow how the he'll did she not pick up the Oscar along with Kevin. Benning seems like a sort of Stepford wife kind of character at first, but you soon find out that she is hiding a whole lot underneath. I love the scene where Carolyn is trying desperately to sell a house and she runs out of luck at the end of the day and starts crying then slapping herself repeatedly saying ""you baby!"" and ""weak!"". That in my opinion is a crucial scene when it comes to Carolyn's character development and giving the audience a deep look inside of her. I was thoroughly impressed with thora Birch's performance too, haven't seen anything from her other than the underrated Disney classic hocus pocus. Chris Cooper is great as the horribly prejudice overly tough ex marine father of Wes Bentley, who also turns in a fine very mature performance. Cooper's is an incredibly sad example a closeted gay man who won't accept his own sexuality and in turn is extremely anti gay towards everyone and takes out his anger and frustration on his eighteen year old son. The movie does a wonderful job at telling the complex stories of each and every character and they all intertwine very well.

The story of the film is good and is told from the perspective of a Man named Lester. He is having trouble holding everything together and especially when his family doesn't show much respect to him. There are interesting things too when he gets attracted to one of a friend of his daughter and even fantasizes to have sex with her. While the film does not offer anything great in the story but there is a little feel of reality in that which might make you curious.

Do you ever wonder what kind of dark secrets and twisted tales might be lying just down the road from you? Wouldn't you like to know all of the harsh realities of your seemingly utopian suburb?

92,29 March 2000,harry-76,5, Cool Reaction,"""American Beauty"" frankly left me cool, unmoved, and repelled by its essence.  There seemed something sickly about its basic conceit, something off balance and disturbed.  While the quality of the acting and production was at a high level, the core of this work seemed unhealthy, exploitative, and overbaked. While there is room for exposing the homogonized and more sober aspects of suburbia, ""American Beauty,"" in a quest to make itself more competitive with other versions of the truth, tended to exaggerate its own emphasis. The result is a film which can be more appreciated for what it tries to accomplish than what it actually does.",

94,5 April 2000,Kronos-8,1, American Beauty isn't,"At the end of this film, Kevin Spacey's character talks about the idea of one's life passing before one's eyes at the point of death. If such a phenomena is true, then I fervently pray that, at the moment of my demise, the two-plus hours I sat in the theatre watching this dreadful movie will be omitted by the Great Film Editor in the Sky. I knew as I left the theatre, long before the awards, that this movie would win the Oscar for Best Picture. It's EXACTLY the sort of condescending, self-important tripe that Hollywood likes to honor. Both ""The Insider"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" were superior movies. I'm no genius, but I demand that a movie be smarter than I. I knew every plot ""twist"" five minutes before it happened, only erring on when Lester would be killed, but not by whom. Unbelievably stereotyped characters. Not particularly funny. I guess that because Lester beats off in the shower or lusts after an underage girl, we are supposed to think this movie is worthy of praise. I wonder how many people would praise the movie if Lester had lusted after an underage BOY? The ONLY good scene was the film within the film -- lovely and poetic. But one scene does not a good movie make, let alone a Best Picture. ""American Beauty"" is nothing more than an extended sitcom (though one that would only be shown on HBO). An utter waste of time. The Hollywood marketing machine has pulled off another cultural coup.",

The impact it had on first viewing didn't quite last. The film was praised for its deconstruction of the American dream and portrayal of the dark undertones of suburban life, but the fact is that was done more powerfully in Todd Solondz's movies, and American Beauty just doesn't seem very shocking - maybe it was more so in the 90's, I'm not sure. As a drama, though, it's still very powerful, and the characters are compelling, lovable and despicable at once, and it does a very good job of making the viewers care about them - in complete contrast with Happiness, with deliberately keeps a wall of coldness and distance. The wonderful acting helps, especially from Thora Birch, who at that point had the potential to become one of the greatest actresses of the new millennium.",

98,21 October 2006,moonspinner55,6," Thinly-conceived, but arrogantly brilliant...","Black comedy from screenwriter Alan Ball is alternately cynical and satirical as it examines life behind the Red Door in garden-filled suburbia. Unhappily married husband and father fantasizes about his teenage daughter's sexy girlfriend while his uptight real estate agent spouse has an affair with her mentor; meanwhile, their daughter gets to know the troubled youth next door, who has icy, dysfunctional parents so rigid they're like horrible cartoons. Overrated picture is thin--and so preconceived to be shocking that it seems rather embittered (although most audiences were not put off). Conrad Hall's Oscar-winning cinematography is exceptionally handsome and the cast is excellent (especially Kevin Spacey, who gives a slyly intricate Oscar-performance), yet the film is hampered by an over-ambitious third-act, unnecessary bursts of melodramatic nonsense (often with a sexual undercurrent), and smarmy vulgarities.

Soon Lester finds himself in a midlife crisis, his wife in an affair, and his daughter in a relationship with the pot smoking neighbor Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley). ",
107,21 June 2020,dr_clarke_2,10, An impressive cinema debut for director Sam Mendes,"When American Beauty won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1999 and numerous other accolades it was instantly hailed as a masterpiece and widely praised by critics and cinemagoers alike. In the two decades since it was released, its star has waned somewhat, with accusations that it was simply overrated when it was first released. But that's probably because it was over-analysed and over-scrutinised: it has aged well and remains an impressive cinema debut for director Sam Mendes.
Alan Ball's screenplay concerns a handful of characters living in an American suburb, and is focalised through Kevin Spacey's Lester Burnham, who narrates parts of the film. In a foreshadowing of the story's end, the story opens with Lester describing his death; aside from a deliberately misleading scene from the middle of the film at the very start, the plot has a linear narrative: once the scene in question is reached, it marks the beginning of Lester's final day on Earth. The plot is driven entirely by the interactions of the characters and has been subject to multiple interpretations, but it sees Lester deeply bored with his tedious suburban lifestyle and rebelling against it by blackmailing his boss, smoking dope with his neighbour's son, and fantasising about having sex with his daughter's friend Angela. It's often very funny, usually in a cringe-worthy way, for example when Lester is hopelessly besotted with Angela to the horror and embarrassment of his daughter Jane.
The characterisation is strikingly effective, from Lester, through his wife Carolyn and daughter Jane, to his uptight, repressed neighbour Frank Fitts and Frank's rebellious drug-dealing son Ricky. Every character is inherently flawed, which is used to generate both drama and humour; the only characters who seem content with their lot are Jim and Jim, a seemingly happy and well balanced suburban couple who are atypical only in the fact that they are gay. Towards the end of the film, Angela says ""I don't think there's anything worse than being ordinary"", which is arguably the film's point.
The casting is perfect, with Spacey giving a typically brilliant performance that conveys Lester's sheer boredom with his life perfectly: his face lights up when he first meets Angela, and again later when Ricky offers him a joint. Annette Bening is just as good as Carolyn, who finds her own freedom by having an affair but is mortified when Lester finds out about it, thus shattering her carefully cultivated image as part of the perfect suburban couple. Chris Cooper is astounding as Frank, and once you know that the character is a repressed homosexual, watching the film again reveals whole extra depths to Cooper's performance. During the scene in which a tormented Frank approaches Lester and kisses him, having completely failed to understand the situation, Cooper's expression says far more about what Frank is thinking than his sparse dialogue. In the face of such strong competition, then relative newcomer Wes Bentley almost steals the show as the complex Ricky.
Conrad L. Hall's cinematography is crucial to the film's success, and his dynamic camerawork lends itself well to the ingenious editing by Tariq Anwar and Christopher Greenbury: the iconic first fantasy scene of Lester imagining Angela naked but for the red rose petals is a perfect example. Close-ups and slow motion are used with surgical precision. Thomas Newman's often subtle, often whimsical soundtrack perfectly suits the film's mood and includes perfectly placed diagetic music at key points.
American Beauty may not be held in quite the high regard it once was, and in its blistering satire of American family life it is perhaps a product of its time. But even at its very worst, it's still enormously entertaining, endlessly interesting and brilliantly made, and those reasons are more than enough to make it worth watching.",

""I showed my breasts on screen gimme gimme gimme"". Whats more, American Beauty also tries to suck so much sap out of you, you'll be blowing your nose with a pancake. The ""plastic bag blowing in the wind"" scene was another pathetic attempt at winning an oscar. There were so many better movies that year that should have won an oscar, or even the best picture,(American Psycho, Dogma,Fight Club). Not much can be said about the acting. Kevin Spacey's skeptical portrayal was overrated it didn't deserve the oscar. The rest of the acting was bland, basic and with bad range. Annette Bening was probably the only good actress, although Geena Davis or Madaleine Stowe would also have done well for the part.

All the characters in this movie are freaks.  They're violent or mean, and you really don't care for any of them.  You don't feel sympathy, and half the time you're afraid one of them is going to just flip out and kill everyone. The movie is too graphic for it's own good.  The violence and non-stop sex related material are enough to get the point across without the excessive drug use as well.

It just made me see the beauty of life, how even though there are painful and messed up things (as well as beautiful things), it doesn't mean we have to act like they don't exist. We just have to realize that every little thing in our ""stupid little lives"" (as the main character says) is meaningful. It's when we take all that for granted that unnecessary problems start to occur, families get broken up and we resort to lesser means of finding fulfillment. I think the scenes/story of Angela and Lester is meant to signify coming alive. Angela made him feel things he hasn't felt in a long time, and actually wanted to take care of himself. At first, he thought his end goal was to get with her, but eventually he realized that it was to see his life from a positive perspective.

In this story Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham who is a burned out magazine salesman and after fourteen years, suffers a a mid-life crises. With his bosses planning to down-size him, his wife and daughter abandoning him and his future becoming mundane, Lester feels he is stuck in a dead-end life with nowhere to go but down. However, into this spiraling, bleak existence enters, youthful. teenage Ricky Fits, a next door neighbor who teaches him that life does not have to be taken so seriously. To add imagination to this idea he is further captivated and sexually tempted by beautiful Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) who encourages his admiring, lustful stares and fertile day-dreams, creating a Lolita like romance. However, situations in his life cause Lester to become unaware of the murderous dangers arising from his neighbors, adulterous wife and patristic daughter, so much so, that what he sees as freedom, others consider destructive family threats.

181,14 January 2001,sosodop,1, The zenith of self-consciously pseudo-profound inanity!,"Someone put it best in one of the reviews I read earlier: This movie is exactly the result of people trying to make a so-called art movie and still win the best picture oscar. American Beauty shamelessly trots out every imaginable convention of what an art movie is and then glosses it over with cute shooting, a relatively short run time and face pace. It says virtually nothing about any of the supposedly unusual or profound content that ostensibly is its subject matter. Apparently issues of would-be gravity making cameo apperaances constitutes a profound social comment. It is a great jumble of clichés (spoilers here maybe): The neurotic wife, the homophobic army man (That he turns out to be gay is not of any consequence since anything serious is not given attention in the film, it is a cute afterthought. Though it would be a serious point if this movie had anything to do with reality)The white collar dick with a mid-life crisis, the artist who sees beauty where no one else can, the pretending promiscuous cheerleader. Are there any characters that aren't stock? I cant believe anyone commented that this is in any way realistic. This is not a portrayal of of American life. In reality the teenager with an abusive psychotic homicidal father does not have 40,000$ and cannot conveniently run away to his friends in NYC. The middle-aged man unjustly fired from his job does not conveniently have information he can use to blackmail his bosses for 60,000$ and live happily ever after. Living in a duplex as a teenager is nothing resembling duress; that would be living on less that one U.S. dollar a day as millions of people do. This could easily qualify as propaganda: When you are rich you dont have to worry, your problem is only that you are not looking ""beneath the surface"" to see the true hedonistic beauty that life is really made of. Well I agree that this beauty does exist. Unfortunately though I am going to burst the bubble of one of the supposedly most profound scenes in the movie: The plastic bag. Look closer, they say, and you will see the beauty in reality. Yes! but this is not reality! Plastic Bags do not blow in circles for 15 minutes. That scene could practically never have occurred in nature; Im sorry I did look closer and it was so obviously being manipulated off camera that it was absurd. That sums up the movie fairly: Look at what we call beauty, we say it is natural but we are really manipulating it. If wind machines (or whatever they are technically called) are really the wind then this movie is really based in reality. Sam Mendes and Alan (whatever his last name is, the writer) are daring the viewer to be as dumb and gullible as they hope they can be. And to my amazement they succeed. If we throw together a whole bunch of artistic clichés and it doesnt make sense to you then you are dumb. Anyone who has a modicum of sanity and any concept of criticism has seen this movie as the charade it is and I stand firmly in their camp. I literally exclaimed out loud (though I was by myself) ""What the F**k??!!"" at the beginning when Kevin Spacey says ""In a way I am already dying (paraphrased)"". It is the zenith of self-consciously pseudo-profound inanity.",
182,10 October 1999,Adrian-32,10, One of the year's finest,"Watching ""American Beauty"" is like looking into a handful of American lives slowly plunging into moral and emotional devastation. Although these people are gaining a sincerely fulfilling happiness, they are also slowly losing their grip on human value and order. This is not your average social commentary, it has something most satires lack; poignancy. On one hand, this is a scathing examination of the facades and truths that surround a seemingly ""perfect"" suburban family, displaying what it would be like if everyone's true colours emerged, as they liberate themselves from the painful phoniness that society forces them to live by. One the other hand, ""American Beauty"" is a thought-provoking and emotionally devastating character study of two families finally achieving joy for the first time in their lives, unaware of the profound impact they are having on themselves and each other, and neglecting the consequences that will inevitably follow. ""American Beauty"" shines in almost everyway, from it's stunning imagery of beauty fused with immorality, to it's darkly hilarious script, this is one of those rare films that stay with you for a long time. But the main thing that makes this movie soar are the performances, Kevin Spacey and Anette Benning are simply sensational as the feuding married couple exploring new realms of life,  Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Mena Suvari and Thora Birch also showcase excellent performances.

184,7 November 1999,GluStick,10, Thought-provoking movie about our lives with great performances.,"I just saw this movie with my mom and sister. I know it had a lot of things in it that would probably make you feel stupid when watching it with your mom but I didn't feel that embarassed. I wanted to watch a movie about real life with my mom so we could have something more interesting to talk about and I thought this would do it. It did. This movie tells the very truth that, I think, most people block out of there minds. Life is full of problems and we all have them. Even if they are differant than other people's problems, they still affect us all in the same way. I would give the movie an A just for that message. Also, most people on this Earth are too preoccupied with their life because they think they have it so bad, that they never stop to look at what they've got. If they were to look and see the many beautiful things in life just once, they'd see that their life is great for that reason alone. Well about the movie, it's great. I think it's the best movie this year so far. The performances are undescribable. Everyone does outstanding jobs, but the best by far is, of course, Kevin Spacey as the ever so true Lester Burnham. He does so good at bring the character to life that it's the best performance I've seen in my whole life and the best in movie history. He is your average person who starts to get fed up with his whole life and lives like he should've lived his entire life: doing anything he feels like doing. Even if that means masturbating right in front of his wife. His life being changed sets off the whole mess that messes his family up more than it already was, which was to say, a lot. He smokes weed, works out, listens to his music he used to when he was a wild teen, even falls in love with his sisters friend. More and more he changes, so does his family. Well, you can figure the rest out for yourself, can't you? Go see it. You'll look at life in a whole new way. You'll realize that your not the only one with problems. Even the people who live in a nice house with nice jobs have it bad. I just hope we can all learn that someday. We might not now, but trust me, you will. American Beauty: A+",
185,16 March 2019,lumieretrain,9, American Beauty by Sam Mendes,"The beauty is one of the most important themes, which has been often explored in songs, poetries and plays. They would transmit different kind of emotions, as they still capture the audience attention. The songs about beauty describe the desperate pursuit of it, in the darkest moments through the most miserable places. The singers would express their emotions in the saddest way, which is often filled with poetic rhymes and touching musical notes. In the poetries, the authors express their feelings with difficulties, when they would find something touching. In the plays, the main characters often act long monologues and soliloquies, to express their feelings and most of the time their doubts. Especially when they would try to move on, by facing unexpected tragic moments. Some plays would end in bad way, which the main characters die only after, they have found something precious that they have been looking for. Others would end in good way, which the main characters live in the peaceful places, where they express their happiness through a long final monologue. After Sam Mendes has directed some plays, he seems interested to explore the theme about beauty. Especially after he read the script written by Alan Ball, which has been offered by Steven Spielberg who saw a potential in Sam Mendes. In 1999 came out American Beauty by Sam Mendes, with Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper and Mena Suvari. The movie's plot: Lester Burnham is a depressed 42 years old man who is unsatisfied with his job, he has also difficulties to talk with his wife Carolyn and his daughter Jane. But since Lester falls in love with Angela Hayes, who is Jane's best friend, he starts to change his life. Carolyn and Jane change their lives as well, until an unexpected conclusion would happen. The movie from the beginning to the end, is filled with mise-en-scènes to create images to look like paintings. These mise-en-scènes are helped by the lightnings to make the scenes more atmospheric, especially when the main characters express their emotions in the specific moments. All the actors played characters who have in common, that they are searching for something important in the course of the story. Kevin Spacey was excellent as Lester Burnham, who initially was excluded like he is not as important as Carolyn and Jane. Until Lester would meet Angela Hayes to change his life, as he starts to do sport to get physically fit, he quits his job to find another one and befriends with the new neighbor Ricky Fitts who would give Lester pots to smoke. Annette Bening did a well done performance as Carolyn Burnham, who tries to be as successful as her real estate competitor Buddy Kane. Then Carolyn would have an affair with Buddy, to have found the success she has been looking for. Thora Birch was really good as Jane Burnham, who would initially act like her friend Angela Hayes. But since Jane falls in love with the neighbor Ricky Fitts, she would be herself to not imitate anymore the behavior of Angela. Wes Bentley did a well done performance as Ricky Fitts, who once he meets Lester and Jane Burnham, he would show both of them a way to find something they missed. Since Lester starts to smoke pots, thanks to Ricky, Lester would kind of live again the youth he missed. Jane would initially not trust Ricky, by looking him with bad eyes. Until she finds a way to be confident with him, as they would have a relationship to be close with each other. Then Chris Cooper was excellent as Colonel Frank Fitts, who would be initially seen as a restricted and homophobic character to not express any emotions. As he would often hit his son Ricky for a foolish discipline, until something would change him to be more emotional and less restricted. Finally Mena Suvari was also excellent as Angela Hayes, who would be seen as an avoided teenage girl. Especially when she tells stories on the time where she had sex with a lot of men, until it would be find out she is a girl who wants to be just a popular teenager. The script was elaborated to see how the story would be developed, from the beginning to the end by creating a workable narration. The score by Thomas Newman creates the emotions needed, to make the scenes poetic and atmospheric. As the tracks of the score are compatible with the most important scenes, by making them unforgettable and emotional. American Beauty is one of the best Sam Mendes' movies, it is also one of the best movies of the 90s.",

190,11 June 2000,shrine-2,5, Shallow and overwrought,"Moviegoers must be suffering from some kind of pre-millennium fatalistic malaise to mistake ""American Beauty"" for a work of depth.  Written by Alan Ball who produced CBS' ""Cybill,""  this movie shares with the sitcom that contempt for anything outside its own narrow sphere of values.  What's worse is this time around Ball tries to pass them off as universal.  Its basic pieties are embodied by one Lester Burnham (played way over the top by the sly Kevin Spacey), and we are asked to trust that his newfound ""freedom"" (Burnham quits his thankless job of 14 years after blackmailing his employer for a year's salary and benefits.) is an example for his control-freak wife (Annette Bening in an embarrassingly overwrought performance) and maybe the rest of us anal-retentives in the audience to follow and quit wallowing in the worship of things and missing the point about the meaning of life. Question is did it ever occur to Ball that there are a lot of us out here who manage to experience the beauty that life has to offer, even when we still sit squirming over where we are going to make the next mortgage or car payment?  I don't expect a Hollywood insider like Ball has to worry about that, and Lester Burnham uses blackmail to avoid the money-grubbing trap that's caught the rest of us poor 9-to-5 lunkheads.  Is it any wonder that Burnham's daughter (Thora Birch) is mortified by her father's behavior? The movie languishes over his getting wistful over her underage confidante (Mena Suvari) so unabashedly, that the same queasy feeling you had when Woody Allen was eying Mariel Hemingway up and down in ""Manhattan"" overtakes you all over again.",

192,23 February 2019,justin-fencsak,10, Worthy of a bargain despite all the Kevin Spacey news...,"20 years ago this fall, American Beauty became a huge hit and won the first Oscars of the 21st century , starting a three year dynasty for Dreamworks SKG. It tells the story of an American family dealing with growing pains. Kevin Spacey is the OCD dad who has a crush on his daughter's best friend, played by Mena Suvari, fresh off the success of American Pie; Wes Studi plays the brunette (Thora Birch)'s boyfriend who is taping the girl on his vhs cam. The cinematography and pacing are pretty good yet what you see what happens when Kevin Spacey spies on the girls is a an accurate prediction of what's to come recently in real life. Look closer and you'll see a classic of the 90s.",
193,4 October 2019,benowen-91207,10, American Beauty,"My biggest fear before watching this movie was that I felt I was going to be unsatisfied with the product, I mean American beauty is considered the best movie of 1999 and hell some say of all time. I'm happy to say that did not happen, yes American beauty is a masterpiece in its own right
The brilliant direction by Sam Mendes and permanence from Kevin Spacey (less we forget) is really what pulls it together. The dialogue was also fantastic and had me laughing at several moments ( seriously that dinner scene after spacey quits his job is absolutely hilarious).
Honestly my biggest problem of the film was the whole 'Spacey's character is going to die at the end' draw. It felt unnecessary in the theme of the plot, the ending voice over of spacey talking about his life felt quite out of place honestly.
Regardless, you should check it out, this film is only a hair away from being a perfect 10 in my eyes. Maybe you'll love it even more",

195,2 April 2020,yuenyeeac,8, A Male Perspective,"Don't old stories from a male perspective say that women are too material, too fickle, and too hypocritical to make marriage unfortunate. Would it be an unfortunate tragedy if men could become responsible, not boring, and work hard to care for their families and children as well as their mothers did? It'd.
Because people are things without conscience. The male perspective and the female perspective are insatiable, hoping that others will clean up the mess for themselves. The misfortunes of love, marriage, and sexual desire are those who have no mind, do not think, self-depress, or suspect that others are not open to this.
When has marriage and love been a one-man business?",
196,31 January 2008,bobsgrock,10, One of the 10 best films I have ever seen.,"This is a masterpiece, perfect in every way. It has completely changed the way I view films and the way I look at life. The acting is excellent, especially with Spacey and Bening. The directing by Mendes is one of the best I have ever seen in a film. The cinematography is so beautiful with the strong contrast between the red and other colors. Aside from being visually beautiful, the story itself is this film's best feature. It is original, with hints of humor, noir, drama, and sadness. Overall, it is thought-provoking in a way very few films are. It is hard to watch what these characters are doing because we know that they are only leading themselves to their own demise. Ball's screenplay is one that should be required reading in film schools and the final sequence is perhaps the most beautiful thing ever filmed. It is a stunning achievement, deserving of every award it got. It is, in my opinion, one of the 10 best films I have ever seen and the best film of the 1990s after Schindler's List. It is so real, so poignant, so heartbreaking. Powerful and serene, this is why I love movies. They can change your thinking.",

It's ""message"", if one could call it that, is little more than a bad joke. Contrary to what you may hear, this film is not, I repeat, NOT a social commentary on current-day life in suburban America, mainly because it has absolutely nothing to do with life in the suburbs. Believe or not, most suburban fathers do NOT lust after their teenage daughter's friends, do NOT try to blackmail their employers, do NOT obtain drugs from the youth next door, and do NOT quit decent jobs to flip hamburgers and ride around in sport cars. Another amazing fact is that most suburban mothers do NOT cheat, or cart their lovers around in their SUVs for a quick bite to eat after having wild sex at the local motel. You'll probably be surprised to learn that the vast majority of suburban daughters are NOT plotting to kill their fathers, that they do NOT expose themselves for the camera of a voyeuristic ""boy-next-door"", or that their friends do NOT try to seduce their fathers with the skill of a street hooker. I also daresay that the ""welcome wagon"" is NOT likely to be led by a local gay couple, and I wouldn't be too concerned about the macho military man next door letting loose with his repressed homosexual tendencies and kissing his male neighbor. And last but not least, most suburban fathers need NOT worry about someone sneaking into their homes and blasting them to eternity. All of this, incredible as it may sound, is what this film asks us to accept.",

203,16 June 2011,compi24,10," Review of ""American Beauty""","What to say about ""American Beauty""? Hmmm. I have never seen a movie that cogently blends together elements of a pragmatic social satire and a poignant domestic tragedy. Though, this is by far one of the most messed up films I have ever seen. . .it is also one of the best. Kevin Spacey gives one of his most memorable performances with his Academy Award Winning Turn as Lester Burnham - a character that is definitely flawed, but you just can't help but like him. Another aspect of the film I admired was the soundtrack. Thomas Newman really succeeds in creating a provocative, yet beautiful score that adequately complements the movie's overall tone. In the end, I feel that ""American Beauty"" is a movie that most people can and will enjoy.",
204,5 February 2017,BeccaGudd,9, One of the best films ever!,"I doubt by now many people haven't seen American Beauty by now. There is so much I love about this movie. It tells the story of the Burnham family who are dysfunctional. Lester is not happy in any aspect of his life and his wife, Carolyn, who is a Realtor pretends everything is fine. Their daughter Jane is a typical high school girl who keeps a lot to herself. After Lester meets Jane's friend Angela his life changes. Jane's life also changes when she meets Ricky the new next door neighbor. As the film goes on you see Lester change and become more confident and more assertive to his wife and daughter. I love how the film touches on problems that every family could face but does it in away that makes you want to keep on watching. I think the soundtrack had a big part to do with it for example the music that plays when they watch Ricky's video of the plastic bag. Although the end of the film is quite sad, I think in a way Lester died happy because before it happened Angela asked him how he was and he said ' I'm great'. It's definitely a film that looks at the darker side of family life in suburban America. If you haven't seen it by now then please do, you won't regret it!",

In each character is a desire to be somewhere else, and in each character there is a major flaw, a weakness. In creating characters like these, Steinbeck has given each character redeeming features in such a way, that however hard you try, you cannot pick out a villain. Each and every character is a 'good guy', but each has their flaws that lead them to tragedy, and that is an excellent dynamic. ",

236,15 December 2014,bsbulldogs,10, Such a beautiful gem of a movie,"I am writing this review for American Beauty after the third time in three weeks that I have watched it and it grows on me each time I watch it. The first time I watched it, I thought maybe this movie is more of a comedy than a drama but after watching it today, I can say this is definitely a drama with some funny moments in it which is what I want from a drama rather than it taking itself too seriously. Kevin Spacey, who is simply brilliant stars as Lester Burnham , a sexually frustrated, average American husband/father who is undergoing a mid-life crisis as he hates his job and his relationships with his wife Carolyn (played superbly by Annette Bening) and daughter Jane (Thora Birch) are strained due to a number of reasons, one being that he becomes attracted to his daughter's best friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari). Add to that, the arrival of their new neighbours, the Fits, Frank (Chris Cooper), Ricky (Wes Bentley) and Barbara (Allison Janney) who seem to have problems of their own. All of these intertwining story lines, acting, music, directing and the script make this movie, in my opinion, an underrated classic of the 1990's which churned out some great movies and what a way to end the decade with a fantastic movie such as this. Hard for me to find a negative with this movie but positives from the movie are the storyline, the beautiful music and score of the movie, directing and of course, the cast of the movie which won the SAG Best Ensemble Award. With the cast, everyone knew their roles in the movie and played them accordingly, Kevin Spacey as the lovable loser, Annette Bening as the ambitious and materialistic wife, Thora Birch as the self esteem-less daughter and in one of her first big roles, Wes Bentley as Ricky, the likable next door neighbour who loves his camcorder and Jane's friend, Chris Cooper as Col Fits, a homophobic, strict disciplinarian father, Allison Janney as the silent wife, Mena Suvari as the egotistical best friend and even Peter Gallagher as Carolyn's real estate rival, Buddy Kane. This film deserved it's Oscar's for Best Picture, Best Director (Sam Mendes), Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography as well as the other nominations including Best Actress-Annette Bening but in saying that, I thought the acting standouts besides the two leads could have been nominated as well including Best Supporting Actress- Thora Birch or Best Supporting Actor- Chris Cooper who put in one of the performances of the year 1999 and has stuck with me ever since or Wes Bentley; either one, take your pick, they were both great.",

244,20 July 2007,FilmCriticLalitRao,8, Midlife crisis : it is no crime to lust and have a cuckold tag.,"Sam Mendes comes from the field of theater and it is a nice surprise that his film doesn't suffer at all from the ghosts of theatricality. American beauty is an intelligent film as it deals with many themes. All of them are rolled in a single,major theme of midlife crisis.It seems to me that midlife crisis is not the only reason behind the protagonist's weird behavior as it has got more to do with the two other people around him :his wife and his teenage daughter.Both of them harass him emotionally on different occasions.It is a good thing that this film has been appreciated by many people especially male viewers. By doing so they are getting ready to face the life when someone reaches 40 year of age.The film has a dream life quality and there are good traces of ""stream of consciousness"".It is sad that after this film Sam Mendes has not been able to make quality films.This is no wonder as sometimes most of the artists prove out to be a one hit wonder.However Sam Mendes will be remembered for American Beauty:a film that addresses some of the fundamental moral questions.",
245,26 May 2020,o-43050,8," Under the watchful eye of the soul, the world is naked","The film is full of extremes, and the appearance is completely opposite to the reality. Violence and sex are staged. When everyone takes off their disguise, they seem to be confused, but they are extremely calm and smile.
The state of everyone in the movie is very similar, so chaotic that there is no protagonist, but why should the movie be described from the first perspective?
Lester was the only one who died, his soul was free.
When a person is about to die, the brain will look back on life, and the soul will stay above the flesh. I think this movie is about gazing at the world with the eyes of the soul. Under the gaze of the soul, the world is bare. The movie perspective previously mentioned is actually the soul's eye.
When I first watched the movie, I was thinking that human beings are too keen to pretend to be ill.
After careful thinking, I feel that the director will not just want to bring us this emotional and extremely pessimistic thought. I think the director wanted to tell us that our soul and body should get along well, not bullying, not occupying, let alone abandon each other and hurt each other.",
246,25 March 2000,Cindy-39,5, overrated,"After months of resisting the hype for this movie, I figured, hey, I like Sam Mendes's work - maybe American Beauty will turn out to be better than it looks in the previews.  Unfortunately I was wrong.  American Beauty really is just the same old recycled view of suburban family life wrapped in a slightly more intense package to grab the audience.  I don't see anything about Lester and Carolyn Burnam that is different from the various frustrated husband and wife roles that have come before.  The film's only saving grace is Wes Bentley and the concept of the intensity of life's beauty.  But that concept only surfaces a couple of times in the movie and is only *talked about* by the characters.  It is never supported by any events or by any of the characters.  It's as if American Beauty was just a very mediocre story about an unhappy family, and somehow the writer managed to throw in a very 'deep' quote.  Perhaps that plastic bag floating in the wind deserves the Best Actor nod - it was the only figure that really inspired.",

American Beauty, like it's namesake, is aesethetic, with nothing  deep below the surface.      Sam Mendes is betrayed by his theatrical background, which renders his images as 2D tableau. It has impressive moments, and Kevin Spacey is a fine actor, but a lack of motivation, drive or substantial plot means it is incapable of providing a satisfying message or characterization. The teenagers exist as a limp sub-plot, the neighbour is a cartoon caricature worthy of Dick Dastardly (but not as funny) Annete Benning's falseness goes way beyond her character, and the whole thing  is nothing more than pretty pictures. I was told (by a v. close friend) , ""You take what you can from it, you draw your own opinion."" This was the case.

The movie is basically all about the lives of American suburbanites but put in a very realistic way. This is a great psychology movie because it shows a large amount of information on developmental processes. The acting and the dialogue in the movie are of course the best part. The movie is primarily based on Kevin Spacey's role which he captures and absolutely stunned me when seeing him. Wes Bently was also very good. It's his script that really moved me and made me think hard about life after hearing some things he said. It's truly a wonderfully well made movie.

But anyone with half a brain will see through this tired male fantasy pretty soon. Mendes shows us a Edward Scissorhands-type of suburbia: perfect lawns, identical homes, etc... We are expected to know (since we've seen ES, Ice Storm, Happiness, Serial Mom, etc.) that these people must lead shallow, empty lives - look where they live! And... they do! This is just the first of many obvious themes that we have seen so many times before. And we haven't even reached Spacey's character's midlife crisis yet. (Surprise! He falls in sexual lust with a gorgeous high-school blonde. Sooooo subversive! Look closer, and you'll find even more cliches.) Spacey's wife is, predictably, a self-centered shrew who won't satisfy him sexually but cooks delicious nutritious dinners and sells (surprise) real estate. His daughter is a misfit (wow!) with whom he can't connect. The new kid on the block (of course there is one) is a weird, sensitive (but handsome) loner type (shocker) who (believe it or not) falls for Spacey's moody daughter. Don;t even ask about the gay neighbors. Mendes does nothing but condescend to his characters, his setting, and above all, the audience.

264,13 June 1999,Fortune-2,10, A beautiful movie,"I saw a sneak preview of American Beauty recently and all I can say is that I intend to see it again.  This is a WONDERFUL movie that is worth the money to see in the theaters (the only movie I've been to where half the audience broke into applause during the film).  Kevin Spacey plays Lester, a man who, while going through a mid-life crisis, begins to lust after a teenage friend of his daughter's.  Spacey is, of course, a fabulous actor and really shines in this role.  There are a few interwoven story lines involving Spacey's relationship with his control freak wife (Annette Bening, who is good if a little bit over the top in this role) and daughter, and the family next door, which includes a military general father, a mother who is apparently clinically depressed, and a very interesting son who is obsessed with filming beautiful things (including Lester's daughter Jane).  What is unusual about this movie is that the plot is not unusual or particularly unique--it's a couple of families in an anonymous American suburb and how they relate--but the filming of the movie is absolutely beautiful, and is done in a way that makes the film alternately hilarious, heartbreaking, and horrific.  It is definitely for mature audiences--there is some violence and a couple of frontal nudity scenes (both of which are essential and very tastefully done)--but older teens might enjoy it as well.  Be wary of how the media chooses to portray this movie--it may be called a ""black comedy,"" but, while sometimes hilarious, it is definitely a drama.  Go see it--I don't think you'll be sorry.",

However, after you've seen it a few times, the rose begins to wilt, unmasking contradictory characters and inexplicable events that unfold just to appease its themes of confinement, conformity, redemption and sexuality—why does Lester lecture Carolyn about materialism right after HE's the one that bought a Pontiac Firebird?

Kevin Spacey plays Lester your average man in the late 90s who begins to tire of his day to day life and after seeing one of his daughter's friends he begins to try and make sexual advances towards her. The film centers around the ideas of identity and beauty as characters seek to find themselves such as discovering that times have past them by. Beauty is a common thread in this movie as the title suggests even if it is a small things like a bag blowing in the wind. The use of music in this film is one of the best I have ever heard as every song reveals emotion or how a character is thinking. Kevin Spacey is great in this movie and I still respect him as an actor(maybe not off screen though). Kevin Spacey is great at playing the pathetic character looking for more out of life. The use of the rose in this movie is very important as it symbolizes desire whether it be the desire for sexual relations or to be through with an average suburban life. The movie is a borderline watch on Netflix as many will probably not enjoy the film as it does not offer too much in terms of action but does in terms of message and cinematic merit.,

This movie portrays the America I grew up in. It shows a couple stuck in their dull American corporate lives. This movie opened my eyes when I was coming of age that adults don't have it all together. They miss their youth and simple pleasures that made them feel alive. The mundane routine of a job you hate and a stale marriage makes you feel dead inside. This movie made me understand what a midlife crisis is. The nostalgia of a car that made you feel alive when you were young and the desperation to feel anything at all when your life has become a prison with no surprises or adventure left. Parents can grow to resent each other and become toxic, fighting over the most trivial things. The perverted fantasy and attention of a young pretty girl woke something he hadn't felt in years, and unfortunately sometimes fantasy gets confused with reality. It's supposed to be disturbing.

The film is extremely well made with excellent cinematography, storytelling, direction and acting. The themes of dysfunction in suburbia are still relevant and American Beauty was an excellent social commentary/satire that is very engaging and well executed. The dialouge is clever and the film is equally effective with its more serious, tragic scenes as well as really funny in the more humorous ones. Say what you want about Kevin Spacey, but his skills as an actor can't be diminished. He is brilliant in this and this is one of the best films of its time. American Beauty is great, thought provoking entertainment that went long on characters and story. Everything the film did, it did very well. Flawless film in my opinion.",

Gender relations had turned upside down: his wife dominated him to where Less-stir stirred less. He literally sat in the back seat. Family broke apart: his daughter wished her parents could ""get a life of their own."" Computers proliferated: profits, losses, and suckers ran glowingly across Lester's face for 17 years. His boss was not a leader or a mentor: his boss was a Brad. With human leadership assassinated, corporate tentacles extended everywhere. Homosexuality became open—to some—scary, to others. Drugs earned a secure place in the culture: Lester gave up drugs maybe too soon and now the kids were into them, making it convenient to have a peddler next door. That's the setup.",

Basically Lester Burnham (deserved Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Kevin Spacey) is a troubled man who seems bored with life. He is getting sick of his wife Carolyn (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Annette Bening), who is having an affair with her rival estate agent, Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher). His daughter Jane (gorgeous BAFTA nominated Thora Birch) meanwhile is falling for neighbour Ricky Fits (BAFTA nominated Wes Bentley), while Lester is having fantasies about her friend, the slutty (?) Angela Hayes (American Pie's BAFTA nominated Mena Suvari). Ricky's father Col. Frank Fits, USMC (Chris Cooper) finally is pretty much being influenced to becoming homosexual. This film is basically the struggles of relationships, mixed with some great comedic moments, and an unexpected ending. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Music for Thomas Newman and Best Editing, it won the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Film, and it was nominated for Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound and the David Lean Award for Direction, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Original Score.

What surprises me is that so many real people, the folks who surf the IMDB , have voted such high honors for this movie, it deserves much, much less than what it has received.

Annette Benning is also scathingly funny as a mother with more problems than meets the eye.  And finally, the passion of the daughter, Jane, with the guy next door, Spacey's passion for his angel (and Jane's best friend) Angela.  There is a lot of funny moments, tragedy, and beauty.

Sometimes I associated, sorry, an ordinary sitcom setting... This genre is called, normally, Tragi-Comedy, but this movie doesn't place the tragic and comic elements at the right places: You don't laugh about a mirror of your own ridiculous and poor lives, but about slapstick sequences in totally dramatic and severe contexts.

I knew none of my favorite films would get any kind of quality Academy recognition, like Director, Picture, or any of the acting categories.  My four favorite films, The Matrix, Go, South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut, and The Sixth Sense, are sure to be virtually shunned of Oscars except for the possible script nomination for either Go or Sixth Sense, and the virtual lock on special effects for The Matrix.  No one can really explain why these films won't get awards and nominations, except ""they're not typical Academy material.""  What is Academy material?  American actors speaking in awful British accents while wearing overly exotic clothing.  Maybe the Academy SHOULD make these types of films ""typical Academy material"", because judging by the fact that all four are on IMDb top 250, the general population feels this way as well.  My fifth nominee, which will most likely be Dogma (based on the script), will almost invariably be dismissed from award consideration.  I figured the Academy would give the movie to some god-awful and pointless art film that no one liked anyway, and everyone would be disappointed, like last year.  Then came American Beauty. This film....is spectacular.  There is nothing to compare it to.  A black comedy that succeeds where Happiness and The Ice Storm failed, American Beauty is a tremendous film that may be enough of an Academy film to snag an Oscar, or two or three, or even, say, half a dozen.  It doesn't have any snazzy costumes or whizzing bullets or superb cinematography, but it does have a solid script.  It does have excellent directing.  It does have the performance of a lifetime from Spacey.  I think I'd be satisfied, though, if this took away only Best Picture.  That's really all it needs, because that's the whole point of American Beauty.  It's not an epic, or heart-wrenching drama, it's a film that asks you to.....look closer.",

Now I know why; how can you not love this movie. A raw satire that doesn't show life from a perspective, it just shows it, period! It shows us that life is very beautiful, you just have to do something with it and not let others run it for you. And that's exactly what Lester Burnham does. Wow,  at least I didn't overlook Mr. Spacey's performance the first time around. His performance deserved all the positive attention it got and I know exactly what won over the Oscar people. It was the smile when Jane Burnham(Mena Suvari) tells him his daughter (Thora Birch) is really happy because she's in love. Perhaps the most endearing, most authentic(if you put yourselves into his shoes) and most wonderfully sincere smile I have ever seen. For real. What an immature person I must have been less that two years ago to find this movie both boring and sad. It is one of the highlights of the previous decade and to those who found my first comment, shall I say, offensive- I truly apologize and hope that I've learned to become a more experienced movie fan to not let pieces of sheer beauty like this slip by me.

It focuses on the trials and tribulations of ostensibly happy, humdrum daily life with all of the idiosyncrasies engendered by the bored, frustrated and jealous people whose lives are pretty empty of meaningful experiences from day to day. I struggled from the outset to see why anyone would be besotted with the rather skeletal ""Angela"" (Mena Suvari); perhaps that is what makes Kevin Spacey's performance so appreciable as the pretty unlikeable voyeur (""Lester""). Are we supposed to like him; sympathise with him, hate him - all of those? I didn't know - and I don't suppose that I really bothered much either. His self-induced mid-life crisis was rather tedious as a storyline, regardless of the actor's (superb) quality of character delivery. Clearly Sam Mendes had a vision for this - but like life itself, it is all over the place. By the time we get to the repressed gay aspects of ""Lester"" and the shame/depression and brutality that it appears to evoke from his thoroughly flawed personality I needed to come up for air...

The screenplay is sharp on these points with each character representing a different amount of sensitivity to the beauty of the everyday world. The script builds these themes around a 42 year-old men having a mid life crisis and having a erotic re-awaking by lusting after a 17 year old girl. The script and direction handle *that* about as well as one can expect. Angela is given a believable characterization to motivate her flirting with Lester. Furthermore, the most overt sexual material is explicitly flights of fancy on Lester's part. Critically, Lester saying no to the ultimate act shows the necessary respect for the issues of consent, age and proper behavior. The film is on a knife's edge throughout its run time with this stuff and it is critical the actor playing Lester does not come off as (too) creepy or predatory.

I thought the neighbor was homophobic at the beginning, but he wasn't. It showed us that things are often different from what they might be.

We can't stop cheering for him, because he's clearly a good guy that has been oppressed. He, and every other character in this, is brilliantly written, with several layers to them. Everyone cast is the exact right choice, and the acting is completely beyond reproach. I did not realize that Bentley was so talented, or Bening. However, I did already know that Birch, Suvari, Cooper and the impeccable Spacey had immense skill, and they certainly show it here. The dialog is excellent and the delivery is spot-on. This is well-written and well thought out. The script is marvelous. This is also hilarious, no attempt at humor falls flat, and it never tries too hard. There is something in this for anyone who is at least a teenager. This has frequent strong language, some violence and brief nudity. I recommend this to those who are mature enough for it. 10/10",
411,16 September 2015,anaconda-40658,9, Rose Pettals.,"American Beauty (1999): Dir: Sam Mendes / Cast: Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper, Mena Suvari: Observant portrait of suburban downfall. Title refers to the ordinariness people accept and the secrets they hide. Lester Burnham hates his job. His marriage is a function for his wife's publicity. He explains that the high point of his day is masturbating in the shower. And he is fixated on his daughter's cheerleader friend. A marine and his family move in across the street. His son works catering jobs to afford drugs, and his watches Lester's daughter via camera from across the street. Stunning directing by Sam Mendes with skilled cinematography. Kevin Spacey is humorous as a man unaware of the consequences of new choices but he plunges full force into a privileged agenda without care until he is placed at the crossroads of the needs of others and appreciating his life. Annette Bening hides her affair under professionalism while slowly caving to the maddening affects of no control. Insecure Thora Birch as their daughter is secretly flattered as the object of an ominous camera. Chris Cooper plays the neighbour whose marine training is crossed with family. Mena Suvari plays a teenage fantasy rebelling innocence within the fluttering red of descending rose peddles. Ads say ""Look Closer"" at the person within trying to break free. Score: 9 / 10",

Each of the characters in this film are flawed in some way and are really interesting. I really loved Spacey in this one, Lester is a character that, although he has a pervy infatuation with his daughter Jane's (Thora Birch) best friend Angela (Mena Suvari), is awesome to root for. I love the moment that he just stopped caring and just through caution to the wind, it reminded me of another late 90s movie about a guy stuck in a dead end job with nowhere to go in life (""Office Space"").",
414,26 June 2018,mehdiblcn-09740,5, Didn't age well.,"1999 was the year of cinema in the US of A. I don't think I have ever had seen as many movies in terms of quantity, but also in terms of quality. It was the year of the Green Mile which I still don't like, but many cinephiles would argue otherwise. It's also the year of ""The Sixth Sense"" the outsider that year and the popular choice.
In that year, the Academy chose American Beauty. They should have picked M Night Shyamalan's movie instead.
Don't get me wrong, I love American Beauty, and still think it's a masterpiece, but I don't like the message it conveys and the agenda it tries so hard to push. 
The performances are all top notch. Whether you like him or not amidst the Me Too movement and its ramifications, he delivered what some still argue as the performance of his career. Again, the cast is top notch and my favorite character is Jane, beautifully played by a young Thora Birch. 
The movie tackles issues that are actually non issues if that makes sense. Living in the suburbs can be seen as the epitome of happiness. Not in American Beauty, where the characters are so bored they're looking for things that make them happy, only to end up completely disappointed. I'm not gonna spoil the movie for those who are yet to enjoy it, but for me, the movie is not really worth watching anymore, expect for the performances.",

It is also an unbelievably unique experience. I know of no other film with the same intriguing, beguiling twists and turns--of scenes and surprises that sometimes take the breath away. There are moments in the film where the laughter is genuine, where the intense drama is almost unbearable, where dreamlike visions spark to life with such magic, we almost can't believe what we are seeing, and where tears flow freely with heartfelt understanding and identification with the characters. . And that brilliant color red--in scene after scene--we can almost smell those roses and recoil at the blood. The great film makers that filmed dream sequences--whether it is Fellini or Bergman or Hitchcock--are joined now by Sam Mendes. There are images and scenes and details in this movie destined for classical status: Angela in the bath of roses (what an image!), Ricky's beautiful heartbreaking film of the flying bag, the extraordinary use of music--whether the pop music from Lester's youth or the gorgeous, haunting Newman score which compliments the scenes so perfectly, Lester's scenes at work (who doesn't fantasize about speaking up the way he does?), the gorgeous, gorgeous meditation on the simple, beautiful images of his life passing before his eyes (bringing to mind Wilder's ""Our Town"" soliloquy that Emily gives detailing the simple, tender, but oh-so-meaningful moments in life, that make life worth living), the emotional roller-coaster, and off-kilter experience the viewer has as Angela and Lester's final scene goes from genuine eroticism, to tenderness, to wistfulness, to wise and profound understanding. On so many levels this film is one of the great cinematic experiences--as a work of art it can be studied and seen over and over again for myriad details, and as a work of the heart--it can be cherished.",

His wife Caroline (Annette Benning in an equally stunning performance) is a workaholic real estate agent. Both are frustrated with their marriage which is basically just for show. Sexually frustrated Lest lusts for one of his daughter's (Thora Birch) girlfriends,Anglea (Menna Suvari). This lust begins Lester's search for happiness in life, so he quits his job and begins to flip burgers just like when he was a kid. Caroline is very frustrated with the fact that she has to be the breadwinner of the family and has an affair. Meanwhile the boy next door,Ricky is videotaping the Burnhams the daughter Jane in particular. The two strike a chord with each other and begin a romantic relationship. Ricky's father, Frank is a homophobe who suspect Ricky is homosexual because he is spending some time with Lester, of course this is not true. All Ricky is doing is scoring Lester some drugs. As the story progresses Lester gets used to Angela, and Angela starts to warm up to Lester. ",

431,25 January 2011,mnpollio,6," Some brilliant parts, but the whole is underwhelming","Interesting, but staggeringly overrated comedy-drama focusing on the rot and discontent underneath the pristine front of suburbia. The film opens with narration from Kevin Spacey advising us that he is dead and detailing the events that led to his demise. Spacey is a typical example of the depressed suburban husband and father. His marriage to shrewish Realtor wife Annette Bening is miserable and he is barely on speaking terms with truculent daughter Thora Birch, who is developing a flirtation with the shy young videographer/drug dealer next door (Wes Bentley). Spacey cracks when he is forced out of his company and goes through a complete life change - including striking up a friendship with Bentley and a flirtation with his daughter's jailbait high school friend Mena Suvari. This is something of an odd film tone-wise. I can find few people that will say they out-and-out love it, but instead they will concentrate on certain elements and praise those factors to the exclusion of others. The acting is really a selling point for this film. Spacey simply has never been better and will probably always be identified with this role. The young cast members are all quite compelling. Suvari's arrogant pretensions give way to a rather touching vulnerability late in the film, while Birch reveals an appealing side with Bentley that is missing from her interactions with her parents. Bentley has also never been better as the intense guy next door, who sells drugs and copes with abusive homophobic dad Chris Cooper, but manages to find beauty through his video camera in the most unlikely places. The remainder of the adults fare less well. Allison Janney has a thankless role as Bentley's catatonic mother, while Cooper is largely a one-note caricature. Much ink has been spilled about Bening and while one can give kudos that she is unafraid to tackle head on a thoroughly unappealing character, it is undeniable that she is really playing a nasty harpy on one strident note. Spacey keeps reminding us that she ""was not always like this"", but our only indication is a flashback to her laughing on a carnival ride, which is hardly conclusive of any range to her character. Some of her scenes - beating herself up after failing to make a sale and the laughable sex scenes with Peter Gallagher - are downright amateurish. There are a number of sequences in this film that are truly arresting and memorable, but for every one that astonishes there are an equal amount that go no where or just completely fizzle. Indeed the film seems to carry an attitude that it is much more insightful than it truly is. The entire scenario of dysfunction underneath the surface of suburbia and its denizens revealing themselves to be polar opposites of what their surface may hint is an old plot device used often well before American Beauty discovered it, so what this film presents is hardly novel or groundbreaking. The end result is a polished film featuring some strong performances and a handful of amazing moments, counteracted by a number of forgettable plot contrivances, a surprising shallowness and an uneven tone that often keeps the viewer at an emotional arm's length.",

Let's just forget everything else and simply stare at Lester's life as he narrates to us. The fact is it is not just Spacey who breathes life into the film, almost every character shines in their respective roles, giving a perfect team work. What the film demands for is, how you, the viewer studies the various characters. What supports Spacey's brilliant performance are an excellent support from Annette Benning, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari. Apart from them the rest other cast give a worthy support. You can't help but gaze at the entire cast performance and get involved with them each mentally because you are forced to see situations from their individual perspectives. Nothing more to say, watch out this film yourself and you will realize that a life can be much more than you ever thought.

But then at school she realizes that he likes her, so they walk home together, and, of course, they end up together at the end. This movie is great, I can't fathom how much I love it. All the characters are amazing, and well acted! The ending is pretty interesting, because all he does is smile at the dead body of Lester Burnham. And the way they show how they all reacted. I have to say, I did cry. And I was shocked to see who killed Lester! Watch this movie, it's worth it, and each time you see it, it won't get boring!",

Before the sixties it had been the privilege of most families on U.S. soil to say that ""The bonds which hold our family units together make us the greatest nation on this planet."" Nevertheless we should not disparage the family values of the rest of the world for our country consists entirely of the indigenous populations of a multitude of states around the globe. We ought to be fair and unbiased when judging ourselves and everyone else, indeed. But as far as fairly judging ourselves is concerned we have come to the point when all our illusions can no longer shield us from the bitter truth.

Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Wes Bentley & beautiful Thora Birch. Witty & intelligent dialogue that's rare in today's cinema, and the structure of Alan Ball's script is just perfect - the best plot narration I can imagine. Marvellous cinematography - one of the rare pictures in current cinema that denies fast-paced camera moves, but instead just sits there in static images that tell you so much more than every camera move ever could. I'd like to say more about that film, but my breath is still taken from watching it the fifth time last night. Besides, I fail further words that could describe it.

475,19 January 2005,apparentlyblue,9," ""Never underestimate the power of denial""","American Beauty is an exploration of midlife crisis and the illusion of a 'normal' family. Lester Burnham (Spacey), his highly strung wife Carolyn (Bening) and resentful daughter Jane (Birch) each struggle to find a sense of purpose to their lives as the facade of their happy home deteriorates. The story follows Lester on a journey to turn his life around after meeting his daughter's provocative friend Angela (Suvari). His lust for the teenage girl inspires a new lust for youth which he captures by discarding all of adult life's responsibilities in an attempt to re-live his youth. As he quits his respectable job, takes on a position flipping burgers in a fast food joint, and starts smoking pot he finally gets the object of his desire  but was it really what he was looking for? Kevin Spacey's performance as the world-weary and rebellious Burnham is magnificent. The honesty which Lester gives off while everything around him radiates artificiality is astonishingly powerful - aided in no small way by Sam Mendes' use of lighting and colour which is remarkable. Visually, every shot is a work of art, a portrait of discomfort. You can really feel the unease as the camera takes you on a journey through the Burnham household, furbished in blue-greys and white  not so much as a fork out of place - mixed with the stark contrast of red roses. In short, an absolutely breath-taking film, American Beauty is shocking yet humbling, sad yet tranquil and ultimately beautiful.",

Mena Suvari is the highlight of the film, with the famous red flower bath scene. Mena looks incredibly sexy playing the girl with dirty intentions.

Movies that I like make me think, laugh, cry, or be p***ed off, but this one drains the dopamine out of my nerve centers. Its another depressing movie that Hollywood uses to promote cynicism of the American dream and to stereotype suburbia. The movie portrays middle class as mean spirited, oppressed, unfaithful, fake, hypocritical, gun toten homophobes who would pluck the gold from your molars before the ink dried on your death certificate. Its not by accident that liberal Hollywood depicts in this film a gay couple as the happiest, healthiest, friendliest and most wholesome of the entire neighborhood while attempting to portray a Norman Rockwell lifestyle as a bogus facsimile of an old American fantasy.",

It's one of the most cynical movies you will ever see. It offers a true honest view of what a typical American family living in the suburbs is like and what happens behind the closed doors. It also has a closing monologue that affected me for life: a lesson about what happens to you the second before you die. How it's true that your life flashes in front of your eyes.

Put some of the sick and twisted at the top of my list of favorite movies-Clerks and Four Rooms for example. My reaction is not prudish. This movie made me ill at the first scene, and more so as soon as the premise was established. My biggest fear is that the vast public acceptance of this trash will lead down the slippery slope into even more disgusting and presently taboo subject matter in an attempt to normalize immoral, unethical, illegal behaviors, and dress it up as movie 'art'.

Yes, Kevin Spacey did a brilliant job in this role. He always gives his best in any role. He lives to act in my opinion. Contrary to other people's opinions. He puts 100 percent in the film and he will go down as one of the great American actors in history. Well anyway, I still think and believe that another actor like Richard Farnsworth should have won for his role in Straight Story because it was his last great role and he has spent a lifetime in the movie industry but that's my only complaint. I do have another complaint and that's the gay couple that lived next door. They just seemed almost functional in my opinion in a neighborhood where straight families are generally dysfunctional in the first place. I don't believe there is anything functional about any family regarding their sexual orientation--straight or gay. Everybody's dysfunctional, it would have been nice to see some of it in the gay couple. They just seemed too happy if you know what I mean. Well anyway that's another little problem with the film but it's otherwise a great film overall. I think Annette Bening should have won Best Actress Oscar beating Hilary Swank who won for Boys' Don't Cry that year. Again she was beaten for her role in Being Julia. Kind or ironic? Annette is brilliant. Sam Mendes has a tough act to follow after winning his first Academy award for his first film. Anyway, I thought Mena Suvari and Thora Birch were pretty good in their roles. I didn't even recognize the great Allison Janney as the depressed wife next door. Maybe her son should give her his stuff to make her happy. She's almost zombie like. I love the scene at the drive-thru restaurant. That's American suburbia in my opinion. I loved Peter Gallagher in his small role. I did feel that the main characters did love each other despite their problems. It's heartbreaking at the end of the film. A great film like this makes you think about your life in suburbia or anywhere. Is anybody really happy? Why do we take on roles like working at jobs we hate and pretend to be happy? That's what American Beauty is really about, are we really happy in our lives? Maybe not as much as we could be. I think everybody can be a great actor or actress-pretending to be happy in an unhappy world called the living. Not to sound depressing but when I saw Carolyn trying to sell a house. The scene of her breaking down and crying was the heartache of life in general. It didn't matter if it was the city, suburbia or rural.

But the symptoms of his crisis (lusting after his daughter's best friend, buying a fast car, etc.) are all quite unoriginal.  Annette Bening plays his ambitious, shallow wife (and there's a degree of misogyny in the way the film takes Spacey's side over hers, when coupled with its portrayal of Mena Suvari's teenage bitch): the other adult characters (the repressed bigot, the cheesy salesman) are similarly cliched.

510,22 December 2005,pgear83,10, A great film,"The debut film of director Sam Mendes was an outstanding satire and was one of the last great works of art of the twentieth century. It tells the story of a tragic hero named Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) who realizes that there is something missing in his life but cannot tell precisely what. He quits his job, blackmails his boss and even resorts to drugs. Tragically, he realizes too late that he has taken for granted what is truly important in life. When I gave a valedictory address at my high school graduation I talked about what is important in life, what is not and knowing the difference. I used this character as an example of both how to look at the world and how not to behave. Indeed, we must try to take a world view more akin to that of Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley), the heart and soul of American Beauty, who finds beauty everywhere. Winner of 4 out of 5 major Oscars (could have easily won all 5) in 1999, the strongest single year in the history of cinema. 10/10",

There was no film, nor role, that he could not handle. He was versatile, had a sense of humor, and could play deadly dramatic roles with the greatest of ease. He excels in this film about the alienation of a middle-aged man with his unfortunate lot in life. He wants to be successful, but he hates being a yes-man, a man who has no substance, merely form. In other words, his two-faced insincerity begins to gnaw at his inner self. His hypocritical behavior is temporarily halted by a pretty young thing, but eventually, his true character comes to bear, and that is not in any way, shape or form like the pretty young thing. There will be millions of middle-aged men who will be able to relate to this film.",

The title refers to a type of rose also featured in the poster, a symbol of superficial and regular beauty that hides an inner, everyday kind of joy that is missing from the characters' lives. A few days ago I watched Fight Club and the comparisons are apt. Released in the same year, they both cover a middle-aged man deeply dissatisfied with his life. He quits his job in a dramatic way and finds an outlet for youthful masculinity in risky activities. Ultimately they come to see the self-destruction immanent in trading one form of trap for another, and end up shot in the head. What separates this from Fight Club is the inclusion of many more characters, all of whom have their own issues revolving around projecting a meaningless fantasy identity and not being able to find true beauty or happiness in the interactions in their lives.",

520,23 September 2011,The-Sarkologist,9, An outstanding movie looking at the mid-life crisis,"This is one damn impressive movie. The advertisement caught me at first - a single rose draped across the naked belly of a woman, and then Triple J gave it a very high rating. At first I thought it would probably be a simple feel good movie, but it is far from that. In fact it is a very intelligent and deep movie with lots of imagery and a deep theme. The movie is about a pathetic man named Lester. He is in a boring job with a wife that cares little about him and a daughter that wishes he would be a role model. In fact, from the beginning of the movie we know that he is going to die. The movie does not let us know who is going to kill him, but the deeper we go into it, the more we come to understand the nature of his death and come to narrow down who will do it. Acceptance of oneself, strength in oneself, and the nature of beauty are the major themes of this movie, and we see this in the major characters. The wife is an important character because she is constantly searching for strength but never seems to find it. She is a real estate agent and wants to be like the King of real estate sales, he main competitor in the suburbs. By the end of the movie, we see her building herself up, learning what it means to be strong, only to collapse into a fit of hysteria at her husbands death. In fact, throughout the movie, the stronger that she becomes, the stronger those around her become and she can never actually reach the goal that she so much desires. Ricky is a guy who moves in next door. He is the character that has everything worked out. His father is a marine corps sergeant and has had to put up with brutal bashings by him. What this has done for him is make him appreciate life, and grow strong in himself. We learn that he has become a very competent dealer with people that owe him favours everywhere. What he knows though is that he knows beauty and he sees beauty in everything. At first we think that he is a pervert, but as we come to know him better, we come to learn that the reason he videos everything is that he wants to capture the beauty of the world around him. When we first see his room, we see a huge collection of video cassettes, and his pride and joy is the video of a plastic bag literally dancing in the wind. I can understand this passion, but as he says, recording it on video does not capture the beautify essence of nature, but rather creates an imperfect carbon copy, yet he desires to capture this beauty forever. Then it comes to the two girls, Jane and her best friend. Ricky tapes Jane constantly but ignores the girl who thinks she is beautiful. Jane considers herself ugly and her mother does little to help this. Her friend says that she gets off on people thinking that she is beautify because people who lust after her push her belief that she will be a model. Yet there is a hidden secret about this woman, and we learn it later in the movie when she professes to be a virgin. Jane never learns of this, but we see a big difference here. Jane has slept with Ricky and is very silent about it, while the other, who has never slept with anybody, but makes up stories goes into explicit details. Now Lester is the main focus of this movie, and he is the character that develops the most. He starts of a pathetic man who's only joy in life is tossing in the shower. Slowly, after seeing his daughter's friend for the first time, gains purpose in his life. He desires her, and when he learns that she desires him, he begins to exercise and to change. The exercise comes first, but he also meets Ricky and begins to buy drugs off of him. Slowly we see him become physically and mentally strong, and by the end of the movie he is standing up to his wife and being desired by the girl that he finds beautiful. His final words to her are, ""yes, I am glad"". He is then killed, but when he dies, and when Ricky finds him dead, he finds the smile of contentment on his face. Lester has died, but he has died a happy man. His life as been fulfilled. Thus this movie is about an epithany. Lester comes to learn and understand himself. He no longer cares that his wife is having an affair with the real estate king, nor does he desire his daughter's friend any more. He is simply content that he is who he is. As such, literature says that he must die. He has this epiphany and has reached the high point of his life. From this point on there is no more so his must die. Life cannot get any better than this so his life has ended and he moves on. This is different to other movies such as Bullsworth, where the main character has an epiphany yet still has things that he can do. Here he has reached the end, done everything that he needs to do, and thus can end life a happy man. The smile on his face when he dies shows us that he has finally fulfilled himself.",

This movie dealt with a lot of egotism in everyone's lives. Kevin Spacey really played his role well enough to get an Oscar. Being an unhappy yutz is one thing, but living the life he now would be murder(hence the fact). Spacey will make magic in just about any movie he makes. ""The Negotiator"" was suspenseful when learns the truth about his superiors. In the movie here, learns how to regain his ""lost youth"" at a time of crisis. Thora Birch was really awesome playing a daughter who downright insecure, and is spooked by the next door neighbor with a camera watching her every move. The most intriguing part of the movie is when she really came out of her ""shell"" to the neighbor. BOLD MOVE, but I'm not going too far with that detail, NO WAY!

It is about a man of the family who wants to revolt a la Michael Douglas in ""Falling Down"", but he does not use violence he use hash and hippie music, blackmailing his boss and making a pass on a 15 year old girl, TRAGIC. Well thats the point of the movie, some might say now. Well if it is I think It is a really bad movie. Due to what I have said I think it is worth seeing, if you don´t have anything to do and you don´t waist any money on it. I voted 4 on IMDb because the film have good photo and good solutions to scenes, and I have seen  worse. The point I wan´t to make is that it so totally overestimated",

A new vision of beauty, revealed not even in the well-known beauty / ugly story, but in a small bag, silently circling along with a bunch of leaves. At that moment, such an unshakable harmony was felt that I really wanted to think about the beauty of our life with you. Of all the heroes, I would single out, perhaps, Ricky. As odd as he may be, and perhaps not exactly a good person, his view of the world is truly amazing. What is the meaning of our life?

Kevin Spacey has just become the frontrunner for the Best Actor Oscar. There will be reason to suspect if he does not get nominated. You could beatty I mean bet that Annette Bening will also get nominated. Co-star Chris Cooper's performance is gripping, insightful, and simply sensational. It will not be too cool if Cooper does not get nominated for a Supporting Acting Nod. Young stars Mena Suvari, Thora Birch, and Wes Bentley execute some real cool thespian stuff also.

The characters are multi-layered, convincing, and full of surprises. It moves from human drama about dysfunctional families to a thriller and mystery over how the lead character dies (that's not spoiling it - the voiceover at the beginning announces that he only has a year to live). A bit less money spent on it and it would be the American equivalent of the European movie, acutely observed, natural-seeming characters as they go about their lives - a bit like The Ice Storm.

The story doesn't have a very good flow, it's like forcing pieces of puzzles together.  Sure if you throw in murder, nudity, in-closet homosexuality, adultery, drug, child abuse, dysfunctional family, insanity, masturbation into any one movie, it'll be disturbing (I think that's the director's purpose). So I am not sure what the other movie reviewers were talking about, the overall impression I got from the movie is anything but beautiful.

But in the end, he can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of his stupid little life. If that's not beautiful, I really don't know what is. The side characters are all so well-written, so fitting. I particularly like the actress playing Ricky's mom, a character that's just kinda waiting until she can finally die. The climax of the movie featuring Ricky's dad is also a great example of a thorough character study. Not to mention that it's just really funny in a weird way. I could go on and on, but I probably wouldn't end up saying anything no one else has said before. Incredible movie.",

I saw it and didn't think it was particularly exceptional. The movie is sort of a sex, lies and videotape meets I Love You Alice B Toklas. Kevin Spacey plays a harried father who decides to ""break out"" of the mold. The somewhat stereo-typical supporting cast is good, but this movie is driven by Spacey's performance. Problem is, once everyone has been introduced and after about the first hour, we're all dressed with no place to go. And there's no place to go here, at least no particularly interesting place that the movie takes us. To a younger crowd this movie might seem ground-breaking and I guess it was in some ways, but not in any way I found particularly significant. What I guess was the primary message - that sex with beautiful women/girls really isn't everything in life - seems pretty obvious to me even without seeing this movie.

Once I saw it, I told everyone I could and they went to see it -- and I am so glad we all did. What a fresh change for a film at the time! This is a film about middle aged adults, being a teen, suburbia, ideals and what goes on beyond those pretty houses in those pretty areas with those pretty schools. It's not a popcorn movie, there aren't any car chases - in other words, this is a film that tells a story. And the story isn't a pretty one although at first it may seem to be. This film is one of those ""good"" films about adults that actually lets you get ""on the inside"", and you see whats happening from several perspectives, including the teens who are in their lives.

They brought a whole new level to the screen as they took their characters from one end to the spectrum to the other. They also showed the raw feelings of how life can take you into a rut with how tough and hard it can be.

You can read all the glowing reviews and believe all the hype about this small, wonderfully moving movie that is making people fall in love with film all over again, but there is truly nothing that you can say or hear that will justify what this movie is all about. I really believe that this is one film that has more to say than almost any film that I can think of and it has more to give than you can possibly imagine. When I walked out of the theater I was smiling for hours and when I went to work I told all of my cronies that this is a film that will change your life. Not only is this the best film of the year, but this could really be the best movie ever made. And to consider a film to be on that level is tough for me because I believe the two best films ever made are ( in order ) Jaws and JFK.

I didn't find this movie entertaining at all, and I didn't find it insightful, or revealing of American suburbia.   Virtually every character in the movie is grossly dysfunctional to a comical degree. Perhaps the most being the wife of the neighbor.  She is comically catatonic, and unresponsive to her surroundings, and her husband doesn't seem to notice, or care.  The Kevin Spacey character is nearly completely estranged from his wife and daughter, but doesn't really seem to be all that concerned about either as he pursues a relationship with his daughter's friend, and smokes pot, and works fast food as his wife cheats on him. His daughter seems to appreciate the attention of the neighbor.  Anyone else would have been treating him as a stalker, and getting a restraining order against him.  And the young man (who sees beauty in everything), seems to have a rather elaborate and open drug selling business out of the home, that seemed comical given his relationship with his tyrant father.",

Or are they?  For who among us, living in this finely woven tapestry that is modern American life, can really define `typical?'  Or for that matter, `normal?'  In what is to be the final year of his life (though he doesn't know it), Lester Burnham (Spacey) finally acknowledges to himself that he is in a loveless marriage, has a dead end job, and has for some time (too long) been a mere observer, rather than a participant, in his own life.  His wife, Carolyn (Bening), a fledgling real estate broker, disdains him, and his teenaged daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), accords him nothing but disrespect.  He has a new neighbor, Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper), a U.S. Marine who is the virtual embodiment of the `Corps,' with a wife, Barbara (Allison Janney), he has disciplined into a trance-like state of existence, and a teenaged son, Ricky (Wes Bentley), who sees beauty in the least likely of places.",

The subplots contribute to the overall feel of the film, so mysterious and magical. The characters are extreme but mirror our society so perfectly that they are outright fictional caricatures and yet remind us of people we all have known. This is a modern fairy-tale motion picture which holds as a main theme the despondency of all members of our society, each layer (teenagers, young adults, parents...) with its own specific existential fracture. The story is excellent, right from the start and throughout the bulk of the movie, up until the excellent climax at the end that is oh so fitting and a true powerful finish - and there is a romanticism about the atmosphere whether through narration, music or image; like a poetry of death.

The movie is near flawless in direction, acting, cinematography, pace, writting, charecter development, entertainment value, and accuracy. Kevin Spacey has the performance of his career and yet it is equalled by the brilliant acting of several others most noticably newcomer Wes Bentley and sexy young Thora Birch. The movie portrays suburban America better then anything I've ever seen and manages to be funny, dark, dramatic, violent, and sad. A virtual roller coaster of a movie that flows perfectly between scenes that are on all opposites of the emotional spectrum. The flow from a dinner scene where Kevin Spacey explodes with rage is hilarious smoothly into the next scene of Thora Birch teaching Wes Bentley about beauty thats dramatic, and finally into a violent confrontation between Bentley and his on-screen military father. The filming of it goes hand in hand with the marvelous directing. The theme of each person seeking out what is beautiful to him or her also teaches the drawbacks to finding it. Spacey does a hilarious and convincing stoned seen. And I'll never be able to get the image of him lifting weights and smoking weed out of my head. I'd like to see Kevin Spacey from Se7en argue with Kevin Spacey from this.

632,17 December 2019,andrewroy-04316,4," In trying to provide clever satirical commentary and be deep and thoughtful, American Beauty exposes how shallow and underdeveloped it really is","It makes perfect sense how American Beauty has aged so poorly, but I am surprised by how much both audiences and critics loved it at the time of release. More than anything, American Beauty is completely all over the place thematically and has uninteresting and motivationless characters. Mendes wants to make a satire on suburban life and how a family's life falls apart in many tiny ways, but the pieces simply don't cohere. Lester is the protagonist and vehicle for the surburban crisis and upheaval the family goes through, but Mendes (and honestly more so Ball's script) can't decide what light to paint him in, or even what moral message his actions are meant to send. Once the scene is set with this seemingly average suburban family, we see Lester's frustrations mount and his small rebellions, from his lust for Angela to his smoking weed to quitting his job. As he becomes more open and shameless about these transgressions (which, it is worth noting, are framed and reacted to by Lester and his family as equally reprehensible, which is another frustration I had), he gets happier and his body language is noticeably freer. Gone is the hunched over, quiet dad, replaced with the dad who throws asparagus at the wall and says what he wants. I guess this says don't bottle up your frustrations? Then, after seeing his wife is having an affair and Angela offers herself to him, Lester is played as the hero, given an easy out and framed as happy and doing an honorable thing by not having sex with her, only to die right after as a martyr. His character certainly didn't deserve such an ending, and the final voiceover rings hollow as can be - Mendes tries to hand wave a larger message about how the world is beautiful and he feels nothing but gratitude looking back at his life? If I'm taking any coherent message from this jumbled film (which, I want to be absolutely clear, I am not), it would be far from something about the world having beauty and instead something about how people have expectations of the people they should be and hide their true desires behind these false personas. Even this is contradicted in some cases, as Carolyn is a perfect example. She never feels like a real person, and after having Lester find out about her affair she is prepared to shoot him only to find someone else had done it for her. It's not clear what she wanted all movie (except to sell that one house early on), and it couldn't be less clear why she was muttering ""I will not be the victim"" repeatedly as she prepared to confront her husband with a gun. Her character is extremely poorly written and has a nonsensical arc. Angela is actually a pretty good character, injecting some humor into the film and with a strong performance. The interplay between her and Jane is good, if nothing more than standard high school social screenplay, and the late reveal that she was a virgin emphasized the degree to which she was performing the role she was expected to have, and wasn't really who she claimed to be. Jane is also on the more nuanced side of characters in this movie, written much more realistically than the adults in this movie and one of the only characters we can sympathize with. Ricky is a decent character, but the events with his father at the end, culminating in his father trying to kiss Lester and then coming back and shooting him were really forced. The gay repression storyline was a prime example of the movie trying to be smart and deep and coming off as extremely shallow - the father is ashamed of his sexuality so he sees the worst in his son and lashes out, and then when he finds someone he thinks he can trust, the father finds out he was wrong and kills Lester. The ""twists"" of who actually killed Lester were truly stupid, especially because it adds literally nothing to the story since both were prepared to kill him. The score also didn't work for me at all, with several montages using the score to act like a character is doing well and getting things done as the marimba plays faster, and it feels contrived and heavy handed. It's not a dull film, and I don't even think it's particularly poorly made, with some good cinematography (I like the rose petals evoking fantasy sequences and the allure of lust and love) and mostly believable performances, but the script is so bad and so convinced that it's clever as to ruin the film. While not similar in any way in type of film, as I ponder the themes and messages that pervade the film, I feel more and more that none of these pieces fit together or make any sense, similarly to how I felt as I thought about Vice. It's the ending, trying to tie everything together as a message of beauty in life, that really convinces me that this is simply not a good movie, that the director's vision falls flat here. As this is my first Mendes film, I'm strongly hoping and expecting to like Jarhead and 1917 more.",

640,24 May 2000,jhaggardjr,10, Brilliant dark comedy,"""American Beauty"" was without question the best movie of 1999. Five well-deserved Oscars (including Best Picture) went to this brilliant dark comedy about a dysfunctional family and the lives that they live. Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, a man who is ignored by his wife, and hated by his daughter. Then he starts to have a mid-life crisis when he starts to lust after his teenage daughter's best friend. What Spacey goes through during the course of this movie is something else. Spacey has given lots of great movie performances in movies such as ""A Time to Kill"", ""L.A. Confidential"", and ""The Usual Suspects"" for which we won his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. He very deservedly won his second Oscar (this time for Best Actor) for his performance here, the best of his career. Annette Bening also gives a great Oscar-nominated performance as Carolyn, Lester's real estate agent wife. In addition to Spacey and Bening, there are terrific performances turned in by Thora Birch as their daughter, Jane; Mena Suvari as Jane's best friend Angela; Wes Bentley as Ricky, the new boy-next-door to the Burnhams; Chris Cooper and Allison Janney as Bentley's parents; and Peter Gallagher as Bening's real estate rival who starts to have a little something with Bening. Even former ""Quantum Leap"" actor Scott Bakula has a great bit part in the movie. Director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball made their feature debuts with this film and what a spectacular job they have done their first time out. I can't wait to see what feature films they're going to do next. Beautiful cinematography, terrific production design, and a memorable film score are also major factors in the film. ""American Beauty"" is a movie that is sometimes very funny, and sometimes very sad. It ranks up there with ""Titanic"", ""Forrest Gump"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Driving Miss Daisy"", ""Terms of Endearment"", and ""Kramer Vs. Kramer"" as my favorite movies that went on to win the big Oscar for Best Picture. An outstanding movie.",

643,6 July 2001,chrisbrown6453,8, A wonderful depiction of midlife crisis.,"American Beauty, directed by British theater director Sam Mendes (Cabaret, The Blue Room) and written by Alan Ball, is a film which focuses on a suburban-American family, portraying its characters' dysfunctional relationships as a direct symptom of their unorthodox conceptions of what beauty is. As its title implies, the film begs the question ""What is American beauty?"" and without providing a concrete answer, it explores the endemic problems haunting many contemporary families: consumerism, unemployment, drugs, peer pressure, loneliness, discrimination and violence. American Beauty opens by having its protagonist, Lester Burnham (a convincing Kevin Spacey at his best) declare: ""I'm 42 years old. In less than a year, I'll be dead. Of course, I don't know that yet. In a way, I'm dead already"". In this simple manner the film establishes its somber tone, its dry sense of humor, its non-linear narration, and its character's fate. Having revealed the fatal outcome, what follows is a brief view of the final days of Lester's frustrated life; of his wife Carolyn's, amazingly enough played by Annette Bening, systematic belittling of him and all things associated with him; and of their daughter's (Thora Birch) overpowering contempt towards both of them. Coupling and/or contrasting these characters' conflicts with those of their repressed neighbors (Ricky Fitts and his ex-Marine dad, played by Wes Bentley and Chris Cooper) and their sexually uninhibited peers (Angela and Buddy King, played by Mena Suvari and Peter Gallagher), American Beauty discovers those harsh elements that lead to infatuation, adultery, murder, and --lastly-- self-reflection.",

""American Beauty"" is a comedy because we laugh at the absurdity of the hero's problems. And a tragedy because we can identify with his failure. The movie is about a man who fears growing older, losing the hope of true love and not being respected by those who know him best. The movie is the story of his rebellion. It's more about sadness and loneliness than about cruelty or inhumanity. Nobody is really bad in this movie, just shaped by society in such a way they can't be themselves, or feel joy. Thora Birch and Wes Bentley are the most grounded, talking in the tense, flat voices of kids who can't wait to escape their homes. Bening's character, a real estate agent who chants self-help mantras, confuses happiness with success--bad enough if you're successful, depressing if you're not. And Spacey, an actor who embodies intelligence in his eyes and voice, is the right choice for Lester Burnham. He does reckless and foolish things in this movie, but he doesn't deceive himself; he knows he's running wild--and chooses to, burning up the future years of an empty lifetime for a few flashes of freedom.

The topic will be interesting as long as the American Dream exists and if there is a good film about it, it's this one. Kevin Spacey was the logical cast for the male lead, but Annette Bening gives a surprisingly superb performance as his wife. Also the young actors do a good job.

665,25 June 2000,rlcsljo,7," Competent, but others are better","This film was generally well made (a typical ""formula"" movie), but I personally didn't get it.  I cant tell you why without spoiling the ending, but I can say that I didn't understand Annette Benning's motivation to do what she did to Kevin.  If you want to see a much better(and funnier!) treatment of pretty much the same subject, I would recommend ""Serial(of Marin)"".  This movie covers marital infidelity in a much broader social setting and never fails to entertain me, despite its 80's bent(although the teenage love interest is not as cute).    This film getting the oscar was kind of like ""Ordinary People"" getting an oscar--I dont think it will hold up 5 years hence.  I  will say now, and many others will say later:  ""Why didn't 'Eyes Wide Shut' get the best picture instead'.",
666,14 September 2013,jedmonds-691-762586,10, Philosophical and Thought Provoking,"American Beauty (1999) is a film about Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), a suburban father slipping deeper and deeper into depression, struggling to deal with his bitch-on-wheels wife and a daughter that hates him. When he meets his daughter's attractive friend, that sparks a mid life crisis, and he decides to turn his life around. The plot sounds trite when you describe it; A man going through a mid life crisis dealing with family issues, lusting after his daughters sex kitten teenage friend. The characters are all cliché; the midlife crisis dad, his bitch-on-wheels wife, his sassy teenage daughter that hates her parents, the homophobic military man next door, and the promiscuous high school girl. We've all seen those characters in movies before. What amazes me about this film is how they brought all these characters together and produced a philosophical movie that makes you think about society. ""My wife and daughter think I'm this chronic loser."" Lester complains, and they see him like that for good reason. ""Just look at me, jerking off in the shower, that's the high point of my day, it only goes downhill from here"" Lester comments as we see a visual of a body blurred by the glass door of a shower, facing away from camera as his arm moves up and down. When you see his infatuation with his daughters friend, Angela (Mena Suvari) you find it amusing and somewhat comical. You see how he acts during his midlife crises, what he says and his actions are also very amusing, and you wish you could get away with doing stuff like that. Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening) is a real estate saleswoman who is obsessed with the idea of success. ""That's my wife, Carolyn. You see the way her pruning shears match her gardening clogs? That's not a coincidence"" Lester remarks introducing her in the beginning of the movie. Carolyn has an obsession of her own, her public image. Jane Burnham (Thora Birch) is the stereotypical teenage girl, sassy, parent-hating, and insecure. She's the opposite of her friend Angela. She's solemn, non-promiscuous, and she's not attractive in the way our society defines it. ""I need a father who's a role model, not some nerdy geek boy who's going to spray his pants every time I have a girlfriend over."" She remarks to her boyfriend Ricky. She's embarrassed by his dad, and the way he lusts after Angela. Most people that review this movie see her as a bad person, but as a fellow teenager, I can empathize with her. To me, the most thought provoking and intriguing character is Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley), the strange boy next door who video tapes all of his life experiences and sells drugs. Ricky seems to find beauty in everything he sees, and seems strange from the outside. When you look into his family though, and you see his abusive, homophobic, marine father and his defeated mother, you realize what's going on behind closed doors. This movie has so many different lessons about society. First of all, the tagline, ""Look Closer"" is a lesson in itself. If you just look at everybody without paying attention to detail, you won't notice anything wrong, but if you look closer, you realize that everybody is in some way or another, trying to fit in. It also taught me that if you look close enough, you can find beauty in everything. For example, the plastic bag scene where Ricky films a plastic bag floating in the wind for fifteen minutes. While people may say ""It's just a plastic bag, what so beautiful about that."" To which I would say that beauty is subjective; what one person finds beautiful might be repulsive to another person. This movie also beautifully illustrates the disillusionment phenomenon we all have experienced, which is when you realize something is not as good as it once seemed. It also taught me to not judge a book by its cover. From the outside, the Burnham's look like the perfect family, but behind that bright red door, it's a totally different story. This is one of those movies that if you get it, you'll love it but if you don't, you'll hate it. If you come in to it watching with an open mind, all you need to do is sit back and watch, and be amazed by its beauty. If you want a philosophical drama movie that will make you think about the society we live in, then this is the movie for you. If you're going to watch a movie, I encourage you to watch it with an open mind. This movie taught me many valuable lessons about society, all while being entertaining and funny at times. 10/10",
667,19 February 2021,ioanpop_,9, Good stuff,"I did not expect that! Sex, drugs, obsession, it has it all. What seems as just another movie about returning, it's actually the definition of deconstructing a character just to build it again in a more powerful way. All this while an amazing soundtrack helps create the scenes. I'm a big fan of classical music in film, or no music at all. A good example of that is ""No country for old men"", where we as spectators can enjoy pure cinema. Sam Mendes, the director did a great job at painting on a canvas with few characters and using a visual effect to his advantage. One of my favourite scenes was early in the film, when Laster was in his bed and from the ceiling roses were coming down. And there she was, a projection of a perverse imagination. Speaking of the protagonist, Kevin Spacey was amazing, as usual. The one actor that surprised me was Mean Suvari playing Angela, the hot girl. She is known for so called comedies like ""American Pie"", this was probably her most important role so far. The star how shined the brides was Alan Ball. You have not seen him in the movie, but you most certainly felt him. I guess the rolle coaster big success continues because besides this, I don't know what else did he wrote. Yes, he's the genius behind all the monologues and cringe dialog that was just so good. But there are some aspects that I would've like to seen made batter. First, there were 'dead' scenes where nothing really happened. As a viewer I was floating around in space, hoping for something. The scene where Carolyn went into her daughters room just to slap her, or the scene with Laster flirting with his wife got interrupted by a potential spill of a bear. We already know the grounds of their marriage, no point in rubbing that in our face. Second, more Laster! I wanna know how he feels. After some monologue lines the movie just abandoned him. The 'it' factor was so big because of the end. I enjoyed it!",
668,8 May 2005,nickmonsta21,8," ""American Beauty"" is a film that is seen through a lens.","The main focus that was taught about ""American Beauty"" was that it was ""Reality vs. Appearance"". I think that the entire movie was scene though a lens. It was obvious that Ricky taped everything and saw everything in his video camera; but the rest of the movie was seen and talked by a dead narrator. This is related to everyday life for some people and it showed a story through experience. I also strongly agree that Angela is a symbol in the movie, and she represents Lester's old wife, and the way his wife used to be. He fantasizes about Angela, and whenever he thinks about her there are always roses in the scene. Lester sees how Carolyn used to be through the representation of Angela. There is definitely a comparison of these two women throughout the film.",

This movie talks about this middle-age pervert for a father, named Lester Burnham, with a an obsessive wife, a quiet daughter, with a friend he secretly crushes for, and meets a strange guy with a video camera filming strange things that refer to him as beauty. Although this movie is completely awkward, that's what makes this movie good. Throughout, there's humor on sex, drugs, profanity, and beauty, duh! Director Sam Mendes is a unique director and brought a wild movie that actually entertains in its own way. Kevin Spacey delivers one of the best performances of the year, and one of the best in his career. Annette Bening is super awesome, and she delivers a lot of charismatic humor. Chris Cooper is golden choice, and Wes Bentley is just wonderful. Alan Ball provides a well-written script that contains perverted humor and some heartwarming messages. This is a well-made film, but it's sometimes awkward and uncomfortable. This leads to some of my problems with the film. This movie is not the type of movie that you and your whole family can see. This contains so much humor that's too unbelievable to notice. It wouldn't be nice to sit there in the middle of the couch with your family, watching something like this. But the rest of ""American Beauty"" is pitch-perfect. The script is beautifully well-written, the cast is amazingly talented, and the premise of this movie is special in an awkward way. ""American Beauty"", in my review, ""a well-made piece of entertainment, but it's just super uncomfortable"".",

677,27 June 2000,barberoux,7, Adolescent.,"This was a good movie, not as good as the hype but worthy.  I thought the theme was rather adolescent though.  It was like a good teenager movie where youth is wise and knowing, in touch with their feelings and adults are louts obsessed with money.  Kevin Spacey played a character who, supposedly, found himself and shucked off all the social crap holding him down.  I guess I saw that whole theme as the rather adolescent.  He could work at a minimum wage job and not have any worries about money and drive his cool fast Firebird. Who doesn't want to return to the carefree days of being a teenager where clean clothes appeared in your drawers and meals were placed before you in a spotless tastefully decorated single home where you hung out in your room and got high listening to music.  I've worked at minimum wage jobs and lived in the hovels you could afford on that salary.  It is not as portrayed in this movie. I saw this movie at a local mega-plex and listened to the crowd afterwards comment on how deep and heavy the movie was as they got into their SUVs and drove to the mall to kill some time shopping. I can understand why this movie won awards since it mirrors the wishes of our pathetic, youth obsessed society.",

As a result the family is completely dysfunctional. All the characters have something weird about them. The society they live in is imperfect, they live in a very imperfect world and the imaginative use of all the neuroses make it a great and suspenseful script, an Oscar winner. The actors were nominated for and Spacey won an Oscar.  American Beauty also won  Best Director,  Best Picture, and Best Cinematography Oscars. I say it deserved them. It mirrors society extremely well. Carolyn Burnham represents the materialistic society we live in. She puts more value into her couch than she does to her husband.   I found it interesting that all the furniture and scenes carry a lot of minimalism and simplicity.  There is in contrast much going on with the characters.  An instant classic, Sam Mendes' American Beauty,   to me parallels Robert Redford's Ordinary People.  Outside everything is beautiful and perfect but inside it is viciously ugly,  full of lust and sin. That simplicity and the primary colors such a the red door, made me pay closer attention to the dialogues.  I found the young adult neighbor weird as far as been a peeping Tom, but had a unique sense of  beauty. I recommend this movie!",

We need to understand that phrase if we want to get any-where near --understanding American Beauty. We also have to know Ricky has been in a mental hospital, and he is a marijuhana dealer. I have read a few reviews about this movie--and I know we all have our own views. I don't think it is about relationships, or individuals. The ""look closer"" message is the key. Its a bit like Mulholland Drive --not really complex. If we all looked closer perhaps we would all see the beauty in things like dancing plastic bags. Or (as Ricky does near the end of the movie).....he sees beauty in blood pouring out of Lester Burhams head (Kevin Spacey). We can talk about the neurotic Carolyn , the mis-shaped daughter , the lost in space friend , the violent father---and on and on and on. This is fundamentally a beautiful movie. We are asked to ""find all that beauty in the world"" We are asked to --LOOK CLOSER. This was Sam Mendes first movie.

All the Usual Suspects are heaved at the viewer (spoiler alert here!):  psycho teens who are really just misunderstood, self-absorbed materialistic suburbanites, middle-aged men who suddenly see clearly and toss off their chains, and of course, right at the top of the checklist, the cruel son-beating homo-hating-but-really-self-loathing-homo-himself military dad.  The sheer pretentious awfulness of this movie is breathtaking!  This is not art, it is anti-art, which seems to fill a need to believe in a hyper-corrupt middle class suburbia, much like UFO abduction stories fill another need to believe.

Birch doesn't quite hit the mark here for me - her character borders on obnoxious and I can't decide if it's meant to be.

The film is an odd, upbeat satire on conventional suburban life, an allegory for breaking away from the 'trap' of normality. However, the intense analytic view the film begs and the ironic tone that encompasses it should not conceal a lack of something genuinely compelling for the average viewer, there's nothing and nobody to admire or sympathise with and little to remember but convoluted messages.

717,13 January 2000,moviebuffcole,5, A mixed-bag of much brilliance but also much condescension,"""American Beauty"" has been praised exorbitantly by both film critics and audiences across the nation. The time has come for a real assessment of this picture. The truth is, that perhaps the hype surrounding it has clouded how good it actually is. Do I think it's a bad picture? By no means. Do I feel it's a strong work, flawed by good intentions? Yes. Let's start off with the character of Carolyn, the burnt-out suburban wife who grows tired of the same-old life. She is played with gusto by Annette Bening. I think the role is written as a bit too much of a caricature to be as affecting as it's meant to be. Bening is memorable in a difficult role, but I do wish Mr. Ball would have taken greater care in making her seem like a woman, rather than a shrill schoolgirl. I almost think a slight bit of misogyny runs underneath this portrayal. However, this role is retrieved with the role of Janey, played by Thora Birch. She makes a sharp contrast to her mother, and perhaps is the way it's meant to be. I hope so. Then much of my hesitancy about the film will be quelled. Kevin Spacey is astonishing in a role both funny and feeling. He captures the innocence and the devastation life causes. He's a man who has become a puppet, and he wants revenge. Spacey is dynamic and quite amazing. The rest of the actors, with the exception to the underwritten Mr. Fitts, are all terrifically appealing. Another strong aspect of the film is its writing (excluding some minor problems in the structure of the conclusion). Alan Ball's screenplay is ribald and haunting, true and beautiful. Seeing it come to life on the screen is a tragic, moving experience, as is the film. Sam Mendes' first-time direction is never less than hynotic. The way he uses the camera and the widescreen is admirable. Every shot seems to be perfectly set, and somehow the camera is in tune to this cold, harsh environment. The direction is first-rate, and among the best of 1999. The first hour of this picture is among the finest I've seen. It's a stunningly biting comedy about suburbia and the hell it brings. Everything is told sharply, with the edge of a scalpel. Satire is wonderful if handled right, and boy is it. The only problem with the film is its climax, which feels a bit preconceived. There's a plot element, involving something using an Austin Powers-like gag that leads to misunderstanding, which sets the final machinations in order. Nevertheless, the ending works because we know it from the beginning. The plot comes full circle. Seeing the last 10 minutes of the movie were akin to an avalanche of emotion, most of them sad and eerie. ""American Beauty"", much more so than ""Happiness"", is a sad work, one in which there's no perfection to be had. The point is told well, and in memorable fashion. AB is a memorable picture in many ways. Anyone not in tears as the inevitable death is played out is doubtful to ever cry. The movie also doesn't force its emotions. It earns them through character observations. All in all, AB is a fine motion picture experience, even if I was a bit bothered by the mechanism that it took to get there. Grade: B+/A-. A fine, sad, penetrating picture. AB is flawed, but at its best, it's moviemaking of the first order",

I can appreciate the artsy way it was handled (for some reason it reminded me of a Napoleon Dynamite type project) but ultimately wound up being just another of Hollywood leftists' attempt at socking it to American values they loathe just so that those in the same little bubble with whom they live and socialize can award them the Oscar.

724,10 November 2016,cdjh-81125,8, A Unique and Compelling Experience,"Sam Mendes' ""American Beauty"" is a strange movie but one that is interesting and relatable and has an interesting way of looking at its characters in a relatable and human way lead by an incredible performance from Kevin Spacey. Spacey just eats this character up he makes him human and sympathetic, every time he's punched around by his family or just life in general Spacey pulls it of with class and defiantly earned his Oscar for this movie. Annette Benning was also great in this film she completely sinks herself into the character of this horrible and cruel wife while I do have some problems with her character Bennings performance is not one of them. I have seen very little of Wes Bentley but he blew me away in this movie I loved his character he at first comes off as an outsider but you come to realise that he has the freedom that very few others do and in a way come to envy him. I love Chris Cooper but I had no idea he was capable of giving such a terrifying performance he's so good in this film and his character arc is such a delight to watch, you come to understand why he is the way he is and come to feel as much sympathy for him than you do for Spacey. Everyone in this movie has a compelling character arc that always gives its characters something to do. Spaceys arc was easily the films best it's just encases everything that anyone would ever want to do if they just let go of the what's expected of him. The way this movie looks at suburban American is done just right it's not done in an insulting way but in an eye opening way, we are able to see how it can tie people down and limits their capabilities. Every decision made by a character in this film makes sense, no matter how bad the choices may be we get why they make them even the eventual murder of Spaceys character is done in an understandable way. However I do have a few problems with this movie for one every character was understandable except for Bennings she just was a horrible person and we never really understood why, she's clearly The one to blame for the bad marriage and they should have devoted more time to build her character up more. I didn't mind the fact that Spaceys character dies in the end but I really wish that they had left it open ended, like me have to guess which one character was responsible for the murder and would have warranted more repeat viewings and made the film all the more compelling.

The premise I thought to be a pretty typical premise, the main theme I thought to be a pretty typical main theme, the characters and acting I thought to be pretty typical. In the end though, the thing that turned me away from it was the execution. I just thought everything about this movie was soooo cookie cutter. For example, we took a break in the middle of the movie (I was watching it with friends) and they all started to talk about how cool it was that the main character smoked weed and was an adult. I rolled my eyes because that is the kind of hip bullcrap that directors and writers put in movies to sell to audiences. My final assessment of the movie was that it was Office Space, but without the comedy. Before people think that I am crazy I will explain this theory. So the main character goes through a religious style experience that shows him he should stop living life by other people's rules. It goes well for a while, but then it starts to alienate the man from his wife/girlfriend and drives her away. He ends up really hurting his best friends/neighbors and daughter. Then at the end of the movie the main character realizes that this lifestyle he has been leading really has no substance and that everything that he had before that lifestyle got out of hand is what gave his life substance. Of course, Office Space has a happy ending and American Beauty really doesn't, but the main theme is the exact or close to the exact same thing. Except American Beauty has not comedy...",

The first time I saw it, I realized I had seen something profound... that's very, very rare. Not only is the story line engrossing, but so are all of the performances. There is not one weak link. But it is the dialog which drives the movie, as it should for people who want to think. No car chases, cats jumping out of closets, animated space ships with wooden characters or people riding brooms. Just words...words which lead to cataclysmic consequences for our protagonist. It's the way of the world. Words are what drive our lives in whatever direction we choose, if we're lucky or doom us if we're not. The wonderful irony of this movie, besides all its other attributes, is that Burnham is executed (for that's what it is) not for any of his foibles, nor his confronting his wife for her vapid existence or confronting her for her infidelity, nor for his romancing what surely must be an underage cheer leader, nor for the hatred professed by his daughter toward him, nor for blackmailing his employer... no he's killed because the father of the next door boy thinks he's gay and finally confronts his own homosexuality, makes advances to Burnham, is rebuffed and can't handle it.",

So, let me get this straight; everyone at the Academy Awards chose this film over ""The Green Mile,"" The Insider, and ""The Cider House Rules?"" Where is the justice?

I love this movie, not only for the great directing and screenplay but the Academy Award winning performance of Kevin Spacey. I had read 'American Beauty' before I watched it, and the way that Spacey acted Lester out was superb. Often you don't get actors who can physically and mentally get into character, usually one is enough. I was also impressed with Annette Bening's performance. She is the complete opposite of her real life self in the film and it really proves the length an actress would go to achieve a the directors true perspective of the character. The story didn't bore me whatsoever, the color could have been much brighter and possibly more uplifting but it doesn't collide with the story. The story is a 'dull life' of a man and when he isn't upset and/or fed up you can see change in brighter color. Like in the memorably famous rose petal scene with the beautiful Mena Suvari, this is Lester's fantasy, it's liberal for him to fantasize and with his life that tends to take forever to end Lester becomes self involved in his fantasy. This movie is totally unique, It's Real, bold and honest. In shorter words, American Beauty is a fantastic movie that I would recommend to any people (Over the age of 15) to watch and maybe take a moment to think about life itself.",
791,21 September 2004,CurtMan@LVCM.com,10," Beautiful, Insightful, Important American Masterpiece","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""American Beauty"" is one of those rare films which succeeds marvelously both in its entertainment and cinematic values, in delivering on a variety of latitudes. It offers a fascinating, simple tale, of a frustrated, ordinary suburbanite finally deciding to reverse the injustices and slums of his life in being everything he has always desired to be. This epiphany comes in the midst of a mid-life crisis, as he becomes estranged from his family, leery of his career and his recent state of life, where ""the highlight of (his) day is in the shower"". Couple this with his sudden fascination with his daughter's beautiful friend, and you have one entertaining, funny, and hearty tale reflecting the American way of life. In the process of entertaining us with whimsical, hilarious, and valuable lines and the actors delivering brilliant, unforgettable performances, we examine some crucial problems in society (e.g. homophobia, drug addiction, obsession with appearance, etc.), in the life of the Burnham family and their new neighbors. This is a funny, genial, and satiric classic of the contemporary American conscience, and the willpower deep within ourselves to correct our seemingly miserable lives. Lester Burnham provides many of us a heroic example of how we can reject everything which has consumed us in our misery, and begin recreation, in quitting our petty jobs, announcing our voice at the dinner table, and perhaps getting in shape to be as impressive as we can be. We learn about the beauty of life not belying in a materialistic, operational society, but rather, in the brilliant blowing of the wind, causing such an insignificant object as a plastic bag to appear marvelous as it dances in the air. This is a film that reminds us that it is never too late to recognize the true beauties of life, to improve upon our own lives, and to strive towards achieving those unreachable subjects of our dreams. This is a cinematic masterpiece, featuring not only an indelible, valuable story, but brilliant, passionate direction, wonderful, biting performances, engaging, unforgettable dialogue, and rich, poignant music. ""American Beauty"" will definitely be remembered and treasured as one of the most important and insightful films in cinematic history, a beautiful gem of a movie. **** out of ****",

Scattered are scenes of some promise, industrially the technical work is competent, and the teenage performances are fine.

812,16 December 2003,Canino-4,3, Watch it Fade,"It's nice to see this overrated film fade from the memory, alongside other Oscar ""winners"", like the silly Thelma and Louise or Sitcom-ish As Good as it Gets. Make no mistake that Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening and Chris Cooper can bring the goods, but this slice of baby-boomer angst is hardly their shining hour. I can also express no surprise, whatsoever, as Mena Suvari is now appearing in one of the endless parade of Cheerleader/Dance films. Critics had her sized-up as the next Susan Sarandon. I had my doubts when I first saw this, that maybe, just maybe I was wrong. Maybe the two gay guys bringing by the fruit-basket/housewarming present had some esoteric,deeper meaning, and wasn't really fit for a Jim Belushi sitcom. Maybe the fact that Chris Cooper paid such maniacal attention to his son (Wes Bentley) it was predatory, and then failed to observe him making thousands, damn near millions, selling the cool-sounding ""Thai Stick"", maybe, just maybe, that, in and of itself had some deeper meaning. I thought maybe Peter Gallagher's bad acting was also part of the spice of the movie. Maybe Annette Bening hitting the target range wasn't really a cliche, but a sly poke at inferior movies that do such stuff. Maybe Kevin Spacey's ""Can we take you to the pizza-joint, huh, huh, huh, huh?????"", maybe that's supposed to be high humor, too. I think of these things, and say... Naahhh. This movie just over-rated. Has my anger about the ridiculous snub of Russell Crowe for The Insider, and that film's complete shut-out surfaced yet? Just checking. All I can say is, fade away, American Beauty, fade away.",

814,7 June 2002,fisherforrest,6, Is this really what life is like in the USA at the beginning of the 20th century?,"""What we have got here is a failure to communicate!"" That's mainly what I derived from watching this worm's eye view of a ""typical"" (?) moderately affluent neighbourhood. Apart from one household consisting of two homosexual males who seem fairly well adjusted to life, every other one in view is totally dysfunctional. Could that hint at an ""agenda"" on the part of writer or director? The film could be viewed as ""Chekovian"" comedy perhaps, but the eminent Russian's characters while living lives of quiet (mostly) desperation at least maintained some hope for the future. You could say they ""tried"". Or perhaps it is a ""modern film noir"". Certainly, almost all the characters are losers. ""Lester Burnham"" may have ""turned his life around"" as has been said, but if so it was in a direction of almost certain ultimate chaos. Only ""Angela Hayes"", late-teenage girl friend of ""Lester's"" daughter ""Jane"" seems capable of salvaging something from the mess.",

822,13 December 1999,Deckard-16,10, An absolutely dark and beautiful film.,"This is an amazing piece of work and it probably tops ""The Insider"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""EdTV"" and ""Bringing Out The Dead"" as my favorite film of the year. Alan Ball's screenplay is one the modern wonders of the world and Sam Mendes's direction matches it (I can see why he bested Michael Mann as the L.A. Film Critics director of the year). Where did these guys come from? This story of an American family and the tiny slice of the world they live in is unspooled before us with the precision and fascination of a geneticist unravelling a strand of DNA through an electron microscope. This is not to suggest that the film is cold (far from it). It just felt like I was watching the characters lives from beneath their skins. Rarely have I felt like I knew an entire cast so well. This will be a hard movie to reward at Oscar time because every single performance hit exactly the right key (""L.A. Confidential"" had the same problem), but obviously Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning should lead actor noms. Spacey has played laconic many times before (I can't think of a film where he hasn't been this way before), but not with the dry wit and comic timing he displays here. Even when he blows up it is dry. Benning has her best role since ""The Grifters"" and makes the most it. She is a Stepford wife with real ambition. They are a married couple who long ago gave up on the American Dream but are too comfortable to give up the Amercian Facade and this is Ball's key contempt. It is a very unique view. While the adults know that they are screwed up the kids still fight to have hope. It is their rebellion. Thora Burch is outstanding as the lone child of Spacey and Benning who is getting killed by her parents' cynicism. The most frightening performance is given by Wes Bentley as the next door neighbor kid who is constantly peeping and taping other people's lives, but also finding beauty amid the ugliness and chaos in some of the film's most moving scenes (a lot people will not get the significance and meaning of the paper bag, but those who do understand the film completely --I thought is was awesome). I think he is acting as the filmakers. Finally Mena Suvari is a revelation as the smart-ass and all-knowing teenage friend who reveals a heartbreaking vulnerability. This film is very dark but like ""Bringing Out The Dead"" there is a redemptive quality leaves you with hope at the end. I was floored by this. It is also a very funny film. American Beauty may be the best film of a very good year.",
823,16 February 2001,Wilbur-10,10, Simply stunning - a cinematic masterpiece.,"I was really unprepared for what I saw when I first watched 'American Beauty' - having seen various clips from the film I was expecting a middleweight comedy-drama about a man in mid-life crisis. I assumed the fixation that Kevin Spacey has with his daughters Lolita-like schoolfriend would allow for some poignant humour all concluding in an upbeat happy ending. On realising instead that the film offered a bleak examination of the meaning of life, it was difficult to adjust my perspective in time.",

826,1 May 2020,furqan-00774,8, American Beauty redifining the meaning of beauty and living life,"The meaning of beauty differs from perspective to perspective. Some people may find beauty in simple things which is without any desires or wishes and some may find beauty in material things filled with lust and hunger. Sam Mendes in this masterpiece tries to tell us that the meaning of beauty in this modern world is not letting your life waste and living it upto its fullest. The movie revolves around the daily problems of an ordinary middle class man named Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) who is trying to find happiness and balance in his life. He is having a hard time in his marriage with Carolyn (Annette Bening). Their daughter Jane (Thora Birch) despises and hates them for interfering in her life often. Amidst this, Lester develops an infatuation for Jane's cheerleader friend Angela (Mena Suvari) and starts having sexual fantasies about her. I was amazed by how delicately Sam Mendes puts forth the idea of beauty and combines this with the American dream. Kevin Spacey delivers a mind blowing performance. No wonder this movie bagged five academy awards including best picture, director and actor in a lead role. This movie is a definite watch for those who want to introspect deep into their lifestyles along with some good drama and fabulous acting.",

In the very second minute, the wife of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), Carolyn Burnham, is shown pruning those blood-red beauties. Seven minutes in, they make an appearance on the dinner table, followed by another at Carolyn's work table. Their significance could have been of some value, just when things get a little creepy, because rose-petals start appearing from inside a teenager's top as she opens it. They fall like fresh snow on Lester as he lies in bed. However, they do not feature merely in the imagination of a forty two year-old cougar. They have also been, and this by far is the most creative use of rose petals I have ever seen, used for tactfully covering exposed parts of a female's body as she lies in a pool full of, guess what, roses. And just in case the movie didn't make it obvious enough so far, it is titled American Beauty. ",

840,5 October 1999,cinemel,9, Entertaining comedy/drama beautifully photographed and performed,"Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, the husband/father in a dysfunctional family, in Sam Mendes latest film, `American Beauty'. His wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), is a real estate agent, and his teenage daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), is suffering from typical adolescent angst. Into their lives come three people who will change their lives and upset the precarious balance of everyday existence. Lester becomes obsessed with Jane's beautiful cheerleader best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). Carolyn falls for Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher), a competing real estate agent, whom she lusts after and idolizes professionally. Jane meets Ricky (the excellent Wes Bentley) who conveniently lives next door and furtively photographs her at every opportunity. Of course this is all a prescription for disaster. Alan Ball, screenwriter, has devised some wickedly funny daydream sequences for his characters.  These are all stunningly photographed by Conrad Hall and scored by Thomas Newman. There is a passionate synergy of all these parts sweeping these characters toward the tragic conclusion which is more than hinted at in Lester's ongoing narration. This is only weakened slightly by a rather predictable last half-hour. Spacey continues to add to a gallery of extraordinary performances (Usual Suspect, L.A. Confidential). Beautiful Annette Bening displays her growing range as a mature actress. Both Thora Birch (Now and Then) and Wes Bentley give career-making performances. Chis Cooper and Allison Janey, as the next door neighbors who are even more dysfunctional that the Burnhams, also etch fine portrayals. This comedy/drama will probably be on many `best lists' and hopefully won't be forgotten at award time. All creative hands here have brought an entertaining tale to brighten the fall film season.",

847,28 November 2004,raymond-massart,9, Our desperate attempts at finding a deeper meaning,"Have seen the movie for the third time and once again enjoyed it immensely. As in all worth while classics, the theme is about our everyday lives and our desperate attempts at finding a deeper meaning. Kevin Spacey, who is once again superb,has reached a point in his existence where he suddenly realizes what life is, has been and what the future has to offer:the only possible answer is: death. This cruel insight (which hits us all like lightning one day or another)is so overwhelming that he sets off on an ultimate search for fulfilment, hoping to find it in a glorification of earthly love. His wife ( an excellent Annette Benning)who is also a victim of the sense of doom does exactly the same although her desperate attempts at finding ""love and understanding"" are more down to earth and do not carry the inherent dramatic message of disaster which Spacey irradiates from the opening scenes on.In the background are the young ones who also have to cope with their search for meaning:their doubts and feelings of insecurity are delicately portrayed by means of exquisite dialog and excellent camera work. Are their ways of escaping from the boredom and predictability of life in general? The inherent message of the movie is ""yes"" but .. the price we pay may be much higher than we initially believed.Another important aspect of American Beauty is that it illustrates how difficult it is to communicate in present-day society: we are all so preoccupied with appearances and how others see us that we refrain from expressing our true selves or feelings of doubt and insecurity.The weak part of this movie is the ending: both the husband and wife reach a form of catharsis as a result of their sudden insight into what they have lost by trying to take on a new identity. Admittedly,too far-fetched and gratuitously moralizing. A special mention for Thomas Newman: ""Dead Already"" & ""Any Other Name"" are beautiful musical themes.",
