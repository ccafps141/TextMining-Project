0,25 December 2005,bkoganbing,10," ""To My Big Brother George, The Richest Man In Town""",I've always thought that the reason It's A Wonderful Life has had such enduring popularity is that more than in any other film it shows what can be the value of a single individual and the contribution to the greater good they can make.,/
1,4 March 1999,Coxer99,10, A Great Influence...,"No movie ever made has influenced me more than this classic. I had the honor of doing a play version of it about 5 years ago. I had seen the film thousands of times, had loved it, but I never really knew what it meant. During the course of the production, I suddenly felt alive. I felt that I wasn't having enough fun. I felt that I wasn't doing enough in my life. Crazy things, like kissing my mother or my father. I hadn't really hugged one of them in a while. It makes you think. It's more of a thinking person's film than a mere Christmas film. If you think it's just a Christmas film, I insist you watch it again and again, until you get the message.",r
2,28 March 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10, One of those quintessential Christmas movies....,"It's a Wonderful Life is something truly special, and along with Scrooge, the original Miracle on 34th Street and Home Alones 1 and 2, it is something I watch every Christmas. Why? Because I love this movie, seriously I do. Looking through my 1000 or so reviews here, I couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed this movie; I have seen movies that I have loved and cherished since childhood and I have seen movies that belong at the bottom of the garbage. It's a Wonderful Life belongs to the former, although I am 17, I appreciate a good movie when I see one. This is more than a good movie, it's a timeless masterpiece, that holds up on repeated viewings and never loses its magic.",e

When the movie is over, when you feel useless in life, watch the movie and your thinking will change and you will know that you have a positive impact on the lives of the people you know. The events of the film were fun. The characters of the film were good. Two characters were prepared, James and Clarence. They were very interesting characters and I really enjoyed watching them. The end of the film is one of the best movie endings in history. I recommend watching it especially the black and white version. The black version is better than the color version.

8,5 November 2002,brianlion,10, IT'S NOT OFFICIALLY CHRISTMAS SEASON UNTIL I WATCH THIS MOVIE,"I am so glad Frank Capra had a vision to make ""It's A Wonderful Life"". I'm glad he chose Jimmy Stewart to play George Bailey. There are some little gems in life that help make life pleasant. It is not officially the Christmas season without watching this little gem. The supporting cast is perfectly matched. Donna Reed is wonderful as well as all the characters of the town. This would be a great movie, even if it were not in a Christmas setting. The holiday flavor makes it even more charming and memorable. A angel trying to get his wings is a little far-fetched, but Capra pulls it off. The impact of living a good life cannot be underestimated. What would life be like for your family if you had never been born? Our actions do speak loudly. In an age of 9-11, we need this movie more than ever. The values of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" still hold true today. Yes, I'll say it, it's a wonderful movie.",r
9,14 March 2010,jon-larsen,10, One of the greatest movie ever made in cinema history!!,"When I heard about this movie for the first time, I thought it was just a forgettable and funny movie. But I was wrong. I saw this movie last Christmas and I did not find it funny, but I loved it, though! Everything is so great in this movie. The story is amazing. The characters are great, and the character's development is fantastic! the cinematography is grea, and the acting is fantastic. James Stewart was mind blowing. The whole movie is amazing,touching and encouraging. You cannot describe how good this movie is. Nor can you describe how good the message is.",w
10,29 October 2003,MovieAddict2016,10, So is the movie...,"Review edited and therefore quite choppy due to maximum word limit.   Has there ever been a truer and more heartfelt character than George  Bailey? This is a man whose life is one of great significance, but he,  like all of us, does not always realize that this is so. He does not  recognize his impact on the world until an angel erases his existence  like chalk on a board. It is then that he is hit by the fact that one  man's failing life isn't always as inconsequential as it may seem.  We all remember when Clarence (Henry Travers) first appears on that  snowy bridge and saves George Bailey (James Stewart) from committing  suicide. He explains nonchalantly that he is an angel and George is  incredulous--until Clarence wipes away his entire past. His mother  doesn't recognize him. George tells her about his uncle as a source of  belief. She states that his uncle has been dead for some time, now.  The best scene in the entire film is that following when George is  thrown out by his mother. He runs towards the camera in an intense wide  shot, his face registering emotions of fear, horror, and ultimately the  horrid understanding of what has happened. This role is the highlight  of James Stewart's career--he never came anywhere close to the superb  performance he gives in this movie. There is a reason it was his  favorite film he ever starred in.  Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey is the grown image of all of us:  As a child he dreamed of nothing but exotic locations and adventurous  travels to foreign lands. But now he is a family man, a father and a  husband. He has left behind his silly bachelor notions, but they still  come back to haunt him. Bailey owns the town savings and loan, left to  him by his father. The cranky Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) wants  complete monopoly over the town, and all that stands in his way is  Bailey and his little bank. But Bailey, an inner disgust and hatred  towards Potter brewing since his childhood days, refuses to cave in and  give it all away.  Then one day, George's absentminded and quite eccentric uncle (Thomas  Mitchell), misplaces a large sum of money, leaving George hopeless and  Potter with a serious advantage. After blowing up at his wife (Donna  Reed) and kids at home, George gets drunk at a local bar, is scorned at  by a schoolteacher's wife, and left dazed and confused, walking through  the snowy town at night during the happy Christmas season without a  hope in the world. Battered and delirious, thinking back over his  apparently pointless and wasted life, he contemplates suicide. He prays  to God and wishes that he had never existed. Which is why Clarence  comes down from heaven to sort things out and answer his prayer.  Essentially bombing at the box office when it was first released, and  then proceeding to fall into copyright problems for years, ""It's a  Wonderful Life"" resurfaced only years later when it was brought back  into the public domain circa 1970. When other channels were airing  expensive Hollywood movies during the Christmas season, PBS picked up  the film and played it as a counter attack, a weak hope prevailing in  them that the classic film buffs out there would tune in. They did. And  so did families across the nation. Every year the ratings got stronger  and stronger and now, almost sixty years following the movie's initial  release, it is considered a holiday tradition.  George considers suicide as a way of escaping his problems without  really thinking over the possible outcomes given his final choice. He  looks back upon his life as wasted potential; he wanted to become an  adventurer, break his family's small-town tradition and become  something huge. Mentally scanning his life to the point in time when he  stands on that bridge, George Bailey believes that he has simply and  truly created a waste of space. He's ready to end his (assumed)  pointless life when his entire point of view is wholly altered by the  power of God. George suddenly realizes that though he never lived out  his boyhood fantasies, he did so much more than he ever dreamed of. He  saved his brother's life, which resulted in a huge impact in later  years; he made an influence in the lives of others and brought peace  and harmony to an otherwise small town by prevailing at the requests of  Mr. Potter; he married a beautiful wife and had children, all of whom  will no doubt have some measure of significance later in the world. And  his wish on that bridge was that he had never been born.  Often I am asked to name my favorite movie, and though I ignore  requests and state that I have not seen every existing movie and  therefore my judgment carries no significance, I have the lightest  whimsy that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" may be my favorite motion picture  to date. I cherish few other films just as close, but to me, ""It's a  Wonderful Life"" is more moving than ""Casablanca,"" a better study of one  man's life than ""Citizen Kane,"" and a movie that will live on in the  hearts and memory of viewers long after we are gone. I believe that  this is the definitive Americana motion picture, regardless of how I  compare it to my other favorites, which may carry the same weight but  not the same true significance. Few films come as close to the heart as  ""It's a Wonderful Life."" And few films come as close to ""It's a  Wonderful Life"" at all, for that matter.  5/5.",1
11,18 December 2010,classicsoncall,10," ""Each man's life touches so many other lives"".","If there's one movie I probably haven't watched enough times, it would be ""It's a Wonderful Life"". The characters, the situations, the message all come together in a way that intrinsically defines it as a Christmas movie, but when you get right down to it, the film transcends Christmas in a way that's truly heartwarming and magical. Jimmy Stewart had that unique ability to put the Everyman into his roles, and this picture certainly qualifies as one of his finest performances. Donna Reed could not have been a better choice to play Mary, displaying a wholesome sex appeal to go along with those traditional home town American values that pictures of the era were so skillful in portraying. Had Director Frank Capra made only this one picture, it would have earned him recognition as one of the true masters of cinema. I could go on and on, but there's really no point in trying to heap further accolades on a picture that has earned it's place in American film right at the top. Watch it, and watch it again, and in taking the picture's message to heart, reach out and help an angel earn it's wings.",7
12,5 January 2007,claudio_carvalho,10, One of the Most Beautiful Movies of the Cinema History Ever,"On the Christmas Eve of Bedford Falls, the guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers) is assigned to convince the desperate George Bailey (James Stewart) to not commit suicide. George is a good man, that sacrificed his dreams and his youth on behalf of the citizens of his small town. He inherited the loan business of his father and he gave up traveling the world and joining the university as scheduled. Later he resisted the proposals of the evil banker Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) and has never sold his business to protect the poor community of Bedford Falls and offer a means to afford to buy their own house. He married his beloved Mary Hatch Bailey (Donna Reed) and had four children with her and a tough life with his family. When his uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) loses US$ 8,000.00, found and stolen by Mr. Potter, George decides to commit suicide, since he believes he worth more dead than alive.

14,25 December 2018,mark.waltz,10, Each man's life touches so many others.,"In looking at this glorious Christmas classic, it's easy to get so involved in the psychology behind it. we obviously become so caught up in our own lives that we often forget about how others around us have influenced who we become and vice versa. This film, which has been redone in many different forms, including taking popular characters from TV shows, both daytime and nighttime and putting them in the same situation as Jimmy Stewart, truly stands the test of time. Not only is it watching one man's slow destruction from things that seem to be beyond his control, it's seeing how one person can deal with the ruthless machinations of the pure evil around him and open the eyes of everybody else to see what's really going on.",9
15,24 December 2021,nickenchuggets,10, No man is a failure who has friends,"Even though it is nowadays considered one of the best christmas movies ever, It's a Wonderful Life was not always seen that way. People at the time thought it was barely mediocre, and that it would probably be forgotten about in a year or two, but 70 years later it has endured. So why is this? At first, I didn't really know whether or not I should consider it a christmas movie, because it does have the aesthetic of the holiday, but a big middle portion of the film doesn't really have a holiday feel to it. In fact, it's actually pretty depressing. I think this movie is constantly remembered as one of the best because it has a very original idea. The story is about a guy named George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart), who intends to kill himself on Christmas Eve because his life is turning into a disaster. An angel is sent from heaven in order to show him how even though he might not realize it right now, his life has meaning to others. Before the angel, Clarence, decides to interfere in George's life, we are shown the events that happened throughout his life starting with his childhood. We see how as a 12 year old in 1919, George is sledding with his brother Harry but falls into a pool of ice water, costing him the use of one of his ears for the rest of his life. We also see how George is lusted after by a young girl named Mary (Donna Reed), who later comes back into his life during his time in college. Sadly, George's father dies soon after, and Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), wants to dissolve George's father's former business now that he is dead. George, with the help of his uncle Billy, run the company now. Under George's direction, his company builds Bailey Park, which is a housing project designed to challenge Potter's control of the town. Potter even calls George into his office and offers to make him his assistant for almost half a million (modern) dollars, but George declines, knowing his real objective is to shut down his father's business. Later on, World War 2 is underway, and George is not drafted because of his partial deafness. His brother Harry becomes a fighter ace and shoots down a japanese plane that was about to bomb a transport ship. Billy goes to rub in Potter's face the fact that one of his relatives is a war hero, but inadvertently misplaces a huge amount of money in Potter's office. A bank examiner then calls out George's company on the missing money, and George realizes he's now in serious trouble, possibly facing jail time. He tries to figure out where in the world the missing money could be, and takes out his bad mood on his innocent family members in the meantime, since he is now married to Mary. Desperate, George heads to Potter in order to surrender his life insurance policy to him to make up for the lost cash, but Potter tells him he's calling the police anyway. George runs away and eventually comes to a bridge, where he sees someone drowning in the freezing water below. After diving in and saving him, it's revealed that the man is Clarence, George's guardian angel, but George doesn't believe him. He says he wishes he never existed, and the angel grants this wish. George's town is now called Pottersville, there's crime everywhere, and nobody (even his own family members) recognize him anymore. He learns that Bailey park is now a cemetery, and George finds that his brother Harry is dead, drowned in a lake at age 9. This means all the men on the transport ship in ww2 were killed, since Harry wasn't there to rescue them. George even sees his wife Mary, who's now a librarian, but she doesn't recognize him either. Now convinced the world is horrible without him in it, George pleads with Clarence to give him his old life back. It does come back, and George rushes home to eagerly await being arrested. Just when it looks like he is actually going to be taken into custody, the townspeople pull through and show up at George's house to make up for the missing 8000 dollars. George also receives a final thank you note from Clarence, saying that he finally has wings now because he was able to successfully help George. What a wonderful movie. It isn't everyday when I watch something that is worth seeing every holiday season, but now that I've seen this, I can completely understand its legendary reputation. Everything about this film is great. There's way too many aspects of it that are worthy of praise, so I'm not going to go over all of them. I will say though that the acting is truly worthy of a classic movie, and both Stewart and Donna Reed live up to their reputations. As George, Jimmy Stewart is an anxious, depressed person who doesn't know what his next move is going to be. He's shown to love Mary a lot, but is more frustrated the longer the film goes on by the threat of Potter blackmailing him. He takes his hate out on his family who simply don't deserve it. He knows he shouldn't, and he feels bad that he did, so he mistakenly assumes that by just literally dropping dead, he would be doing the world a favor. Clarence later shows him how wrong he is. Donna Reed as Mary is the love of George's life ever since he was a kid. It's clear to see why she hates to see him so bitter, especially around christmastime. Lionel Barrymore as Potter does his job really well. He's everything you want to see in an antagonist. He always belittles George and makes him feel unimportant, and intends to make life really difficult for him by closing down his company. Even Gloria Grahame shows up at one point. In my opinion, this is an odd holiday movie because there is a big portion of it that doesn't feel like christmas, but the second half of it makes it worthwhile. It reminds me a lot of A Christmas Carol, because Scrooge sees how horrible his world will be if he doesn't change, and so he decides to become a better person. To be clear, It's a Wonderful Life truly earns its praise as not just one of the best christmas movies, but one of the best movies, period. Capra really did know how to make films.",0

It's a Wonderful Life is a truly great movie and I, like many others, have a habit of watching this movie very year on Christmas Eve, so I am this year. From where to start, this is from music, acting, screenplay, camera, directing, scenery, plot to adorable little details (squirrel on Uncle Billy's shoulder) the wonderful movie.

22,20 December 2022,thelandofoo,10, A Deeply Moving Holiday Classic,"Shortly after the end of WW2, the tastes of the American people yearned for something more real like the war, which lead to the underperformance of Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life as it was deemed too sentimental. After years of being played on television, it eventually got the attention it rightfully deserved. George Bailey, played by James Stewart, yearns to leave Bedford Falls, but one unfortunate event after another calls for George to make sacrifice after sacrifice, until it all culminates to one crucial moment on the night of Christmas Eve when he is at his lowest and most vulnerable. James Stewart presents a wide range and a layered character and one we can root for as his dreams go further out from his reach. How the writers brought Christianity into the story was appealing to me and is approached in a way that makes it universally digestible. We have ourselves a great cast of memorable characters that show some growth and then there is the easily detestable Mr. Potter, who seeks to take over the town and is continuously at odds with the Baileys. The tone of the movie itself I found to be perfectly balanced as we get plenty of heartfelt moments, but also some dark and intense ones as well. It's a Wonderful Life proves to be more than a holiday classic, as it excels with its story that everyone can take something away from. Final verdict: 10/10.",_

Life affirming and relentlessly hopeful (and cynical) it portrays a world where people matter and life is worth living.

It also has messages regarding materialism, and how money and ""things"" aren't really what's important in life. Despite George's failed dreams, he still touched people's lives in ways he couldn't measure until his guardian angel showed him.

28,9 December 2021,HotToastyRag,10, Sentimental and Timeless,"The wonderful (pun intended) thing about this Christmas classic is that you can appreciate and fall in love with it all over again as you age and reach different stages of your life. When you're a kid, you enjoy the fairy-tale elements of the story, and you laugh at Clarence the Angel's lines. As a teenager and young adult, you identify with George Bailey's famous speech: ""I know what I'm going to do today, and tomorrow, and the next day after that."" He has so much hope, idealism, and the time to spend on righteousness. But the older and older you get, you see the tragedy in George's journey. You feel sorry that he never achieves what he wants and that he spends his life taking care of other people and holding down the fort for the reserves that never arrive. That's why, no matter how old you are, you always cry at the end of It's a Wonderful Life, and that's a wonderful thing.",r
29,31 December 2015,ironhorse_iv,9," Director Frank Capra's bittersweet, heartwarming Christmas movie is a wonderful movie!","'Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings'. That is the quest for the guardian angel, Clarence Odbody (Henry Travers) when he was assign to take care of a suicidal man named George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart). Clarence must try to show George, the tremendous impact he has had on his community before it's too late. Can Clarence, change George's mind or will this Christmas, be the last for George Baily? To find out, watch the movie! Made just after World War 2, this movie was a favorite for both leading man Jimmy Stewart and director Frank Capra. It's easy to see why. There's so much things to like, about this film. The film is full of delightful moments, from music and a dance sequence, funny comedy, and heart-warming romantic scenes. While, some critics might see this film as too sentimental and syrupy. In fact, in my view, most of the movie's vision is something out of a more modern complex, dark-edged sophisticated film. Yes, there are some really dated dialogue, sayings and behavior, but for the most part, I think modern audiences can still, watch this movie and find something about it, that they can related to. No matter how often, you get to see this Christmas favorite, there is always something timeless with this film, when you do. Important message about the value of an individual life and how one person's actions affect all those around him/her is a great life moral for people to take. Themes about family and friendship are also very important. Another great message is having faith, and belief in yourself and the future. After all, director Frank Capra himself said he made the film in large part to ""combat a modern trend towards atheism and Nihilism"". While, a lot of people say, that this movie isn't really a Christmas movie, due to the fact, that 90% of the movie is a story about George's life and takes place at some point in time other than Christmas; in my view, the whole Clarence arch, wouldn't had work as good as it did, on any other day of the year. There is something about Christmas, that makes the whole magically redemption story with Clarence somewhat believable. Based on the short story ""The Greatest Gift,"" by author Philip Van Doren Stern, It's a Wonderful Life was never intended to be the Christmastime staple that it is now. In fact, when the film was first released back in 1946, it was generally considered a box-office flop. This film had a resurgence for a while in the U.S. during the 1980s when it was discovered that the copyright on the film was never renewed, which meant the film was in the Public Domain and any television station could legally show it as often as they wanted without paying for a license. Many stations across the country would run it, around Christmas time, to the point, that people label it as a Christmas movie. No matter, if it's a holiday movie, or not. A lot of critics, has point out, that the film protagonist's action are very similar to a Christ figure in all. I have to say, they're somewhat right, but there were some moments that George Bailey got really problematic to sympathize with. Some people feel that brought all his problems on himself by choosing to run an over-leveraged, illiquid bank business even though he's given many opportunities to do something else. However, I didn't find it, too abrasive to watch. What I didn't like, is how he treat Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) for most of the film. He was a little too mean-spirited to her; mostly in the beginning of the film He nearly ruin his first date with her. I really didn't like that. Thank heavens, he got more likable, as the film goes on. Still, the drunk driving scene was a bit hard to watch. Anyways, Jimmy Stewart is wonderful as George. I'm glad, he didn't quit, acting after the war. He gives the performance of a lifetime, here. Alternately affable and bitter, he is the movie's little-man hero. All of his emotional were, mostly play as for real. Seeing this, Capra had to reframe the shot in order to get it closer than was actually filmed because he wanted to catch the expression on Stewart's face. At the time, this shot was an extremely time-consuming project, each frame had to be done individually, making it only one step away from stop-motion animation. Capra spent the whole night doing it. Thank Goodness, he did! Most of the supporting cast are just as good as Stewart, but one-person stands out. Donna Reed is wonderful, despite her character being a one-dimensional manic pixie dream girl. She was really able to show the character's beautiful, supporting and caring nature. Just say the word, Mary, and I'll lasso you, the moon, indeed! I just don't buy the idea that George and Mary are somehow supposed to be soulmates. It's a bit unrealistic to think that Mary can only love George. Nor, do I believe, without spoiling it, that the ending of this film seen can be seem as ""happy"". After all, George is still in the same position he was before Clarence show up. An investigation is still looming. There are tons of others puzzling questions, still worth debating. So a rewatch, is needed. One thing, when watching it, is not to watch the color version. The black and white works well, to show the symbolic snow of the peaceful Bedford Falls, when compare to the cold and dark sleet of Potterville.

30,4 October 2001,Hitchcoc,10, A Wonderful Film with a Cutting Edge,"Once again, my two cents' worth of a film that is the darling of so many people, myself included.  It has its uplifting conclusion, and the theme that every life has its purpose in the great scheme of things.  George Bailey is in trouble.  He has decided to end it all.  The thought of jail and disgrace is more than he can handle.  George's life has been a continual parade of missed opportunities.  There is a layer of pain just above the surface of nearly every scene.  George is a victim and this series of disappointments takes its toll.  He eventually becomes hardened and frustrated, but because he is honorable, he goes about the business of living.  He has gifts he doesn't realize.  He has family.  He has status, and while not often appreciated, he is.  Unfortunately, we don't always share our love and admiration with those who deserve it.  His sense of adventure from birth has been clutched from him over and over.  His bad ear makes the army an impossibility, his father's death forces him to run a business he wants to run away from, and even his honeymoon money is used to prevent a run on the bank.  George never knows his importance until Henry Travers' well meaning angel comes along.",

33,19 December 2002,Senator_Corleone,10, The fable still holds up,"I just re-watched this film with my family as an annual Christmas tradition (first time on DVD though). I have to say, despite the 10-11 times i've seen this, it still holds up with magnificent strength and emotion. The scenes where Bailey has ""never been born"" with Clarence the angle and the triumphant concluding scene in Stewart's house where all his friends come to his aid are famous beyond comparison, but still are mesmerizing and emotional. What often is overlooked is the mountain of great dialogue in this film. Barrymore and Stewart have so many great lines-""I'm and old man and most people hate me, but I don't like them either""; ""Oh, why don't you stop annoying people!""; ""Is it too much to ask that people can live their lives with a few nice rooms and a bath and not have to live in your slums? We need this run-down old building just so there can be somewhere people can go and not crawl to Potter."" Jimmy Stewart gives one of THE performances of all time as the ultimate put-upon good guy George Bailey. All he wants to do is get out of Bedford Falls, travel the world and go to college. But, because of a string of coincidences and occurences where George puts others above himself, he ends up never leaving the town. Donna Reed is his loving wife Mary, who waits around for George to realize that he loves her. This situation leads to one of the most touching and romantic scenes on film, where as the plastic magnate Sam Wainwright talks to George and Mary on the same phone, they look into each other's eyes and you see the what they truly feel for eachother. George grabs Mary, saying ""I don't wanna get married to anyone anywhere at anytime"", but he is cut off in the middle of his speech by the emotion, and they embrace. Rob Reiner claims he can't watch or discuss this scene without tearing up. How Stewart and Reed didn't win Oscars for this scene alone is unthinkable. Also, Lionel Barrymore is great as the evil Mr. Potter (with his wheelchair pilot/crony, Potter is the predecessor to everyone from the Beatles ""Mean Mr. Mustard"" to Mr. Burns on ""The Simpsons"")-who you believe is just a mean old man at the beginning, but then when he gives his final major speech to Stewart you realize what a twisted and cruel monster he truly is. The director, Frank Capra, must also be given credit when praising this film. He directs the actors and frames them in such a way that the true relationships and actions between them are so much more meaningful. He really knew what he was doing when making this film. The make-up and lighting department also successfully show the wear of 18 years on the principle actors-this movie takes place with the same actors from the period of 1928-1946, and Reed's and Stewart's make-up jobs are extremely convincing. Some great moments: The close-ups of Stewarts face when 1.) He lears if he doesn't take over the Bailey Building and Loan, the board of trustees will vote with Potter and drive the institution out of business, and 2.) In the fantasy scenes, where he runs away from ""Ma Bailey's Boarding House"" and realizes that not even his own mother regognizes him. The speech Bailey gives condemning Mr. Potter after Pa Bailey's death and Potter's appeal to liquidate the Building and Loan. A young George Bailey reveals to the pharmacist Mr. Gower that because he was so grief-stricken over the death of his son that he put the wrong medicine in the wrong tablet, and the look from Gower when he realizes that if not for Bailey, he would have done a terrible, terrible thing (this moment always gives me goosebumps). The look of disgust and horror on Stewart's face after shaking Potter's hand after being offered a job, then wiping his hand on his jacket-symbolising his realization that if he had agreed to work for Potter, he would have been selling his soul to the devil. This scene is followed by the wonderfully tender moment between Stewart and Reed where he stares at her in the dark as she tells him she is pregnant. Capra's greatest gift to the common man, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" still holds up beautifully. It is a morality tale with a timeless message that no man is poor who has friends. It's the ultimate happy ending, and the ultimate Christmas story.",

It was intended to be released in 1947, but when a Technicolor print of ""Sinbad"" couldn't be delivered on time, this film was put into release. For that reason, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" - possibly the most wonderful film ever made - was overshadowed by ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" But you can't keep a great film down, and as the years have passed, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" has found its place as an iconic film that means Christmas. It's survived the public domain (due to a clerical error, when the copyright was not renewed in 1974), where it was cut to ribbons and shown so often on television (and why not, networks could show it for nothing) that people were sick of it.

At first, I thought there was no way I could enjoy something so outdated; however, I was wrong. This movie was amazing, and had a storyline that I think can be applied for centuries of Christmas times to come. My favorite part of this film was when the main character George Bailey was stuck in a town where he did not exist. He kept trying to find all the people from his life that were most important to him, yet no one knew him. Feeling isolated made him crazy, and he wanted his old life back. The lesson of this movie is to not take life for granted and that even if it doesn't seem like it at the moment, you do have an effect on others. I give this movie a 10/10.

I can't think right now of a reason why it's not a perfect movie. There must by a flaw in there somewhere but right now I can't think of one. It truly is a movie that gets better every time I watch it. I find new things to focus on each time I see it. Sometimes it's the dialogue. Sometimes it's religiousness. Tonight I focused on Jimmy Stewart. Wow, he gives a performance of a lifetime. As I watched him tonight, I wondered about Stewart losing the Best Actor Academy Award. Who beat him out? Fredric March in ""The Best Years of Our Lives"". March was great but I'd give the edge to Stewart. He's in almost every scene.

46,10 January 2005,Freddy_Levit,10, An inspirational heartwarming experience. A Timeless Classic!,"George Bailey is a man with goals, ambitions - a man of courage, integrity and pride. But all he has ever done his whole life is assist those in need, never for a second thinking about himself. Wanting to see the world before he sets off to college for an architect degree, he finds that he can't let his town crumble against the miserable, hateful, greedy and powerful 'Potter' and so he decides to stay. His father passes away, and so he must find a way to run the 'Loans' business that his father has kept from the mad man 'Potter'. All goes well for Bailey - a beautiful wife, a few children and a lot of friends. Although still handing out loans like his father before him, he pursues his dream of building and constructs a home village with affordable houses despite Potter's mass influence on the township. Unfortunately for Bailey, things begin to point downhill following the Depression and later bankruptcy where Bailey just can't handle the weight of burden of all the people's money he cannot repay. He comes to the harrowing conclusion that he should never have been born and decides to leave his family and friends and take his own life off a bridge. But the world cannot dispose of itself such a man, so god sends an Angel on a mission to get its wings, or better yet to save George Bailey's life. The Angel shows George what life would have been like had he not been born at all and of what became of the people he took dearly. Miserable under Potter's absolute influence, the town looks like an over indulgent, over spent, money making machine. George gets a glimpse of his own powerful influence on his friends and family and realises just what a wonderful life he really had.",

The other night I felt the urge to see it again, from beginning to end, after that fun compilation from the AFI, 100 movies, 100 Cheers. The most surprising thing about this perennial classic is that it's not just a good movie but a sort of miracle. Age has made it more relevant, more powerful. Frank Capra is, without question, its miracle worker. His narration style was a first and in a way unsurpassed. As you may very well know, the film wasn't an instant success. A peculiarity it shares with most of the great works of art. The truth is something that needs time to be confirmed even recognized. James Stewart's performance lived from a 2006 stand point is, quite simply, extraordinary. Capra's films were known as ""capracorn"" in their day. Strange to think about it now because its sentimentality wasn't really sentimental but a need to find goodness in the darkest places. The great Capra not only found it, it unmasked it with the same relish that he unmasked evil and greed. My only regret is that on this times of technical prowess we'll never see again the likes of ""It's Wonderful Life"" But, trying to look on the bright side in the most Capraesque kind of way.

That ending is such a huge release after such as a dark and depressing alternative reality. I'm always left shaken up by it and need a break before I can watch another movie as well as making me want to make amends with loved ones. I'm sure everyone who watched It's a Wonderful Life thinks to themselves what the world would be like if they were never born. The struggle of George Bailey is relatable to a wide spectrum, and I know for myself it really hits home. Being stuck in a dead-end town and feeling you will bust if you don't get away from it; having your life not going the way you intended it to while your siblings appear to be doing so much better than you. But in at the end George Bailey realises what he's got when it's all gone, above it all, God's greatest gift. It's a Wonderful Life takes placed in a world in which God exists (and can focus his time on this one person over the rest of the world, but I digress).

67,21 December 2014,zardoz-13,10, Nothing Short of Superb!!!,"Three-time Oscar-winning Hollywood filmmaker Frank Capra made one of the greatest Christmas movies of all time ""It's A Wonderful Life"" starring James Stewart, Donna Reed, Thomas Mitchell, and Lionel Barrymore. This warm-hearted Yuletide yarn about life in the small town of Bedford Falls and its protagonist George Bailey (James Stewart), who wages an eternal war with a despotic, Ebenezer Scrooge-type banker Potter (Lionel Barrymore), personifies the idealistic spirit of American enterprise. Basically, the theme Capra's movie explores is the individual does matter in our society. The ultimate value of any movie is its capacity to stand the test of time, and this memorable Capra-esque fantasy has succeeded splendidly in this respect. Initially a box office washout because it barely recouped its $3 million budget, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" (1946) didn't languish long in obscurity. Incredibly, the Capra film acquired a new lease on life when National Telefilm Associates mysteriously neglected to renew its copyright in 1974. Consequently, tv stations aired this family friendly film ad nauseam until Republic Pictures intervened in the 1990s and renewed the copyright. Now, most critics have acclaimed Capra's film as a timeless Christmas classic. Ironically, Christmas doesn't play an integral part in the plot until over half of its absorbing two-hour plus running time has elapsed. Meantime, as its altruistic hero, George Bailey epitomizes America's competitive spirit and crusades tirelessly to spare honest, industrious Americans, largely immigrants, from the autocratic few who would subjugate them without scruple. Of course, life has changed radically since this Oscar-nominated film came out. Nevertheless, its message of compassion and humility in the face of heartless cynicism and material exploitation has survived. Unlike too many Christmas movies which venerate the occasion strictly for consumerism run amok, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" tackles one tough issue most of these sugar-coated narratives shun. Suicide sullies the minds of the less fortunate during the holidays, but Capra and his screenwriters treat it in an imaginative manner.",

I know that's a minority opinion; my family thinks I'm nuts. But look, Bailey's a dreamer, brimming with a youthful ambition that gets snuffed out time and again by his obligation to Bedford Falls. Sure, there's a message here, that he protects the town from predatory capitalism, but to see the man struck down by one cruel twist of fate after another is beyond frustrating; and the payoff feels cheap in comparison.",

80,19 December 2009,TheUnknown837-1,10, an enduring classic that has only gotten better with age,"James Maitland Stewart was one of the most inspirational and admirable actors who ever lived. Although his range of talents allowed him to effectively play whatever kind of role he wanted, he is remembered most for the roles where he stole the audiences hearts. He was nominated several times for an Academy Award, but won it only once and at that time felt that his friend Henry Fonda deserved it more. In my opinion, James Stewart should have won the Oscar at the very least three times. He deserved the one who received for ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940). And he should have won it for his performances in ""Vertigo"" (1958) and his most beloved classic, ""It's a Wonderful Life."" This improving-with-age classic is generally marketed as a Christmas classic, but that's very one-dimensional. Yes, the perfect season to view it is during the said holiday season, but it's about much more than that.

105,15 March 2005,jboothmillard,10, It's a Wonderful Life,"This is the best Christmas film ever made from Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated director Frank Capra.

Also, Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) is threatening George with asking for money and trying to tempt George into buying the Baileys business. When money goes missing, Potter won't help him (for being rude) and he has a fit with his wife and kids, he soon thinks about ending his life. Until he meets Clarence (Henry Travers), who calls himself an angel without wings, he can only earn them by helping George. To prove himself, Clarence grants George the wish that he never existed. When George goes back to town everything has changed, the twon is called Pottersville instead of Bedford Fals, members of his family are no longer around, and nobody recognises him, not even his wife. When George discovers how much of a difference he makes to the city he wishes to be back again. It is heart-warming when he is so happy to be back to normal and he ends up as a millionaire, and Clarence got his wings.

106,16 August 2007,dataconflossmoor,10, Perspective!!!!,"This will be my 100th comment on this website, and, it stands to reason that I should pick an all time classic movie such as ""It's A Wonderful Life""!! This film is Frank Capra's best film ever... A statement of this nature tells you how remarkable this movie truly is!! Jimmy Stewart was voted by one magazine as the second best performer ever in the history of Hollywood!! Only second behind Katherine Hepburn, making him rated the best actor in the history of movie making!! While some people may question this assessment of Jimmy Stewart, due to Jimmy Stewart's innocuous Huckelberry Finn disposition, I can empathize with this verdict of Stewart's acting on account of his precisely executed latent tendencies which ultimately resonated into an articulated anger!! Jimmy Stewart's acting is very itemized, and thus, it establishes emotions which are genuine, these emotions relegate Stewart to a vulnerability which was pertinent to the fact that his feelings which could no longer be bottled up inside of him, would make him obtusely erupt!! Donna Reed is in this movie, and her performance is very believable as well!! Lionel Barrymore is extremely adept at playing the role of the ogre (Mr Potter) who is metaphorically writhing in his acquisition of the Baily Building and Loan!! This movie is the classic Christmas movie of all time!!, ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""Fantasia"" as well as any other Christmas movie, do not capture the spiritual camaraderie related to the yuletide association with caring and benevolence that ""It's A Wonderful Life"" exemplifies so flawlessly!!What the film ""It's A Wonderful Life"" accomplishes is the ideology behind the true meaning of what Christmas signifies... This phrase in of itself sounds very rhetorical, however, with a movie like ""It's A Wonderful Life"" such an accolade is the genuine article!! ""It's A Wonderful Life"" resembles the movie ""Best Years of Our Lives"" in the manner by which a happy ending is attained the hard way!! Often times, we look at our lives and become demoralized at the uneventful banalities which perpetually plague us!! We are depressed at how money dictates virtually everything, and, as was the case with George Bailey, we become trounced by failure and despondence!! Adversities are what make us cohesive, considering that this film was made right after World War II concluded, we as Americans were thoroughly aware of such a fate!! The fatal predicament which besieges George Bailey in this movie arouses occasion for all of the good citizens of Bedford Falls to bond together and realize the importance of caring for each other!! Such a homespun philosophy was anything but an artificial panacea, and with it, Americans immersed themselves into a nationally guarded perspective of good will and compassion!! This film is outstanding!! The talent and the ideological premise to this film, has out-shined virtually every other movie made!! A socially responsible movie is entitled to the luxury of a heartfelt happy ending, especially if it has been earned!!! Films which make people feel fortunate are not breaking any rules which compromise the quality of a film!! All of these carefully devised components to this film make ""It's A Wonderful Life"" an absolutely magnificent movie!!",
107,21 September 2015,Forest-G,8, Arguably James Stewart best performance,"To be honest before I watch It's a Wonderful Life, I really don't like James Stewart. I watched him in Vertigo, Rear Window, and other Hitchcock's movie, and I don't like him at all, I think he was so typical and 1 dimensional. After I watched him in this movie, I start to like him, especially when he acted in the last part. Well I guest I just hate Hitchcock as a director, not Stewart as an actor. ",

Watching it, whether it is the first time or 50th time, reminds the viewer of the meaning and significance that was once ubiquitous in film. Movies in the modern day are largely filled with cheap thrills, one liners and constant stimuli. It's a Wonderful Life is the complete opposite. It tells a story that is so fundamentally important that it almost NEEDS to be told. The lessons that can potentially learned from watching this film are invaluable. The beautiful and talented Donna Reed gives one of, if not the best female acting performances I have ever seen, and James Stewart portrays George Bailey so well that it is hard to imagine separating the man from the character.

Was it crafted for suicidal maniacs maybe? No, no, it can't be that; too dark for children and too childish for adults. I don't like to use the word ""dated"", but this is what I would call a dated film with a dated (now cliched) message.
Well, it has an intensely naive positive message, but maybe necessary for that period. But why so much optimism? Could have been because of the post-war overoptimism? The Post-World War II economic boom? Could be.
The film is clearly flawed, objectively speaking. The main problem is the protagonist. With just a few occasionally bursts of anger towards the end, he has a flawless character. Altruistic, nice, tolerant, idealistic, etc etc. He is the perfect white boy. The antagonist is pretty much the antithesis of the main character. Stereotypical Walt Disney cartoons-like characters? Well, almost. Almost! Also, this is a fantasy film not because of the fantastic elements, but because characters act unnaturally during specific events. Some moments are too cartoon-ish and unrealistic. At least those moments are funny, so I can forgive this aspect (this is actually the case in many classic American movies).

For a movie fan, you will be happy because the movie has the same feeling as Spielberg comedies, it begins like Stand by me and ends like BTTF2: the nightmarish small town V2 is really well done. James Stewart looks like very much David Lynch and he is a true fine actor! The story is full of good values, hope and in addition is aware in punching greedy capitalism!

Hilariously parodied by more contemporary films and series, not excluding Married With Children, the idea and execution, let's be honest here, is trite and cloying. Stagy performances and a dragging screenplay is really all that there is for the viewer to mercilessly swallow while the lengthy running time of the film brutally tests one's patience. Had the director shaved off 30 minutes or so from the excruciatingly melodramatic and repetitive second act, the movie would have been far less exhausting, though the silly what-ifs the story puts forth wouldn't have been any less clunky and witless.

James Stewart plays George Bailey whose desire is to leave town and explore the world. His dreams are hindered when his father has a stroke thus leaving him in charge of the bank. His brother becomes a war hero, and he marries his high school sweetheart, played by Donna Reed. This is all observed by God and an angel named Clarence who is given Bailey's background through flashback observation before embarking on the moment where discouragement reeks him leaving him saying, ""I wish I'd never been born!"" Director Frank Capra is famous for films such as It Happened One Night and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. This is his masterwork. Stewart brings out the innocence of an individual driven by good, while Reed plays off the dreamy romantic who believes that Bailey can lasso the moon with his determined nature. Henry Travers brings wholesome goodness as Clarence who is out to earn his wings. Lionel Barrymore plays the villain Mr. Potter whose greed knows no end. Thomas Mitchell plays the forgetful Uncle Bailey who misplaces a large sum of cash. It shows what life would be like without our existence. It would not be wonderful. Score: 10 / 10",

For example, it's wicked to know that this film won an award for special scientific/technical effect involving a novel method of snow production (foamite, soap, and water highly pressurized then fanned out)! I thought that was cool. Regardless, the beauty of old films is that (due to budgetary constraints I think) shots are held for a lot longer. In my humble opinion, the fewer shots per scene (I would have to take data on this, but I think the claim would stand) allow one to become more emotionally invested and focused (aka not thrown left-right-left for a talking scene...I'm listening to people talk here, they're not getting 1-2 combo'd in the ring!).

And shock of shocks, it wasn't until today (of Christmas Eve of all times, ho-ho-ho) that I finally sat down and watched it- it wasn't a 'family staple' in my house- but I knew I had to watch it, if only to see James Stewart in the seminal role of George Bailey. It is, no doubt, with enough fantastical scenes to make up a couple more movies, and the heart that sits right in It's a Wonderful Life beats with all the vigor and pride of the most schmaltzy- and rightly proud of it- American spirit. That I ended up not finding it to be a truly astonishing movie may be that I'm just a cynic deep down, or that maybe this kind of story, and how it plays out, has ended up being done so many times I practically knew what the story was before going in. It's the most amazing of credits to Capra and his cast and crew that it does hold up this well, and that the sentimentality stringing together much of what happens is actually well earned. But it does teeter on becoming a bit too dated, or rather that it's appeal of being a fable really only works best when dealing with the crux of the character George Bailey, and almost becomes weird in how it leaps from great happiness to the terrible bleakness of modern American life.",

MY ALL TIME FAVORITE FILM : Perennial Christmas classic about George Bailey (Stewart's best acting performance, one for the time capsule), an idealistic dreamer whose out-of-reach plans for himself are constantly set aside for his family and the town he helped in more ways than one. One of the best films ever made about a man's universal struggle with what he wants and what he does resulting with the immortal question: What would life be like if I were never born? Stewart's performance depicts every emotion superbly and facing suicide shows just what a complex character interpretation he has. His salvation comes in the form of Clarence, his guardian angel still trying to earn his wings, who shows him exactly how things would be had he not existed. Best scene: after Stewart is refused entrance by his mother he races into an intense wide/close-up and the registering of fear, horror and finally understanding that spreads across his face is ultimately moving, chilling and heart-breaking all at once. My favorite moment; if you're not moved by this, you 're simply not human. Dare not to sing along at the end to ""Auld Lang Syne"" and dare not to cry. Definitely a film ahead of its time (originally a box-office flop and snubbed royally at the Oscars losing largely to the WWII American classic ""The Best Years of Our Lives""). Frank Capra's masterpiece was his and Stewart's personal favorite films.*Trivia note: characters named Bert & Ernie would eventually be paid tribute as ""Sesame Street""'s immortal buddies and Stewart's and Reed's characters, George and Mary are also my parents' names.",

I haven't seen the film since I was a wee youngin', but here's what I remember, in images and impressions: Stewart plays George Bailey, a kindly man who's spent his life looking out for others and putting his livelihood on the line to,help those who are less fortunate. The man is a walking ode to the meaning of Christmas, but when a financial disaster ruins his outlook on life, he contemplates suicide. A compassionate angel named Clarence won't have any of it though, coming to his rescue in a sequence that's now immortalized in cinematic Valhalla.

If you and your family have money problems like George Bailey it's not the end of the world because you have each other. Your children are everything and that's the feeling i got from this film.

Popular enough where it became an annual Christmas tradition for many families. It was surprising to learn the film received mixed to negative reviews upon release. Today's general consensus has the picture as a sentimental, sweet-hearted film that delivers an important lesson or two...a sentiment I can certainly agree with.

189,22 August 2009,lucianomarzo92,5, Seems overrated.,"This movie is depressing, which makes it quite inappropriate for a so- called ""Christmas movie."" I made the mistake of watching it on Christmas Day one year, and it turned out to be a damper on the whole holiday. Not just for me, but the whole family. The acting left a little to be desired. I will say whoever acted the angel was very good (I think it was Henry Travers). His character was also strong. But James Stewart's character was pretty depressing. He makes the small mistake of saying ""I wish I had never been born,"" and shortly after, his wish comes true! He still lives in his hometown and is the same person, but all of his old buddies ignore him when he tries to talk to him. Even his family shuns him. If you are going to watch this movie, make sure it is not actually on Christmas or any holiday, for that matter.",

This is what I would call a ""perfect film"", in that it accomplishes everything it sets out to do, and what it sets out to do is of the utmost ambition. This is, in every little detail, a magnificent masterpiece, like a modern tale that never leaves you.

197,12 January 2018,thejcowboy22,6, After the War James Stewart hasn't lost his touch!,"During the decade of the 1980's It's a Wonderful Life was aired constantly on television during the month of December. I really wasn't interested in the film but the power of repetitiveness and boredom or lack of an alternate shows made me take notice as I gave this movie a viewing. The movie starts with angels, (not shown) focus on the life of George Bailey (James Stewart). The angels or heavenly brethren discuss the self sacrifice George goes through his entire life starting in childhood from saving his brother Harry from falling through the ice to catching his distraught, drunken Pharmacist boss Mr. Gower (H.B. Warner) from filling a lethal prescription. Onward George attends Harry's (Todd Karns) Senior prom and meeting his future wife Mary (Donna Reed). On the way home George learns that his Father died and he has to sort out his Father's business affairs with his savings and loan. George saved up to see the world but the irascible Old Man Potter (Lionel Barrymore) wants to dissolve the savings and loan to avoid future competition. The board of director's vote to keep the savings and loan on one condition. George Bailey runs the operations with the help of his absent minded Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell). Another sacrifice as the world tour is quashed. George also gives his college tuition to his younger brother Harry in hopes of Harry taking over in four years. Four years later Harry has a better offer to work for his future Father-In-Law as he introduces his fiance to the Bailey's. George agrees to stay on and run the savings and loan. George and Mary wed and plan a huge world Honeymoon trip but the stock market crashes and there's a run on the bank. The Baileys dole out their wedding money to their customers with a whole two dollars left over. Another sacrifice. As time goes on George builds up his business and developed' Bailey Park affordable housing. An alternative for residence of Bedford Falls who currently live in the slum rentals provide by Old Man Potter. Potter attempts to lure George to work for him for an annual salary of $20,000 but George tells Potter bristling with anger to forget it. Meanwhile World War II is in full swing as Younger Brother Harry joins the Air Force and is decorated the Medal Of Honor for saving a Transport of troops from a Kamikaze fighter plane. The story is printed in the local paper on Christmas eve as Uncle Billy brags to Old Man Potter in the bank as he makes out a deposit slip for $8000.00. Absent minded Uncle Billy drops the money in Potter's lap as he goes off to the teller's window without the cash. Meanwhile back at the savings and loan the Bank examiner shows up to check their books. When Uncle Billy tells George he lost the deposit. George goes into panic mode with rage and despair. George comes home to his family in a disturbed manner. Then George runs off and our story takes a dark turn as George tries to kill himself but is intercepted by angel Named Clarence (Henry Travers). George wishes he was never born and Clarence grants that wish. What George witnesses is a lesson in the human spirit wondering how one human life can affect,touch another. In an interview with James Stewart toward the end of his illustrious life remembers being apprehensive in continuing his acting career at the conclusion of his part in World War II as he was highly Decorated for numerous flight missions over Europe. Director Frank Capra and co-star Lionel Barrymore wanted the down to earth prowess of Stewart for the role of George Bailey in this film. Jimmy didn't disappoint despite lack luster receipts at the box office this movie improved with age and is a classic film for the holidays. This was also Donna Reed's film debut as a leading lady. Honorable mention for some cameos in the picture. Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer as Mary's original escort. Frank Faylen as Ernie the cabbie. Ward Bond as Bert the cop.

Don't say just about blazing editing or unique cinematography, drama doesn't need those so much. Maybe just the soundtrack that counts to the synergy of movie construction.

The movie is legend in senses and to be fair probably doesn't need another review praising it but I will give it a go anyway, although as I said before the start for me is not flawless. I did feel the first maybe full half of it was although great, not at a level I expect from masterpieces but this movie showed me oh it did.

An American classic that all its residents watch on Christmas Eve, just like our "" Irony of Fate, or With a light steam!"". I wanted to see this picture for a long time, but all my hands did not reach it, and then they finally reached it, maybe not in vain. Maybe this time was needed? Who knows, sometimes accidents are not accidental! Here, I come to myself after watching this, I'm not afraid to say this word, ""masterpiece"", which was directed and directed by producer and director Frank Capra immediately after the end of the most terrible and bloody war in the history of mankind. And I took it off so that the lump in my throat does not go away for more than an hour after the end of the viewing. And here is my brief opinion for you - A deservedly cult American classic! I will say right away that there are no minuses in the picture, well, not at all, well, not a drop, well, not even a tiny bit, and do not even try to see them here - you will not find them, so I will dwell in more detail on the merits of this masterpiece, which I am sure will survive more than one century.",
205,27 September 2009,johnmschofield,9, A timeless enjoyable classic,I have only watched this film about 3 times but I like it for all sorts of reasons. It has an extremely powerful message and for me it is delivered in a subtle way by introducing it very early on in the film. Its almost as though its a very subtle product placement during one of the external scenes. All of the cast are perfectly suited and that is rare indeed. The film is a timeless enjoyable classic and it does not pull any punches when it could have. Due to the year it was made it could have been reduced to a slick waste of money but fortunately the professionals who were responsible for making this tale had the good sense to make it right and I suspect that the actors enjoyed the experience every bit as much as most of the people who have watched this film in the sixty odd years since it was made. At the time of writing this film is at number 30 of the IMDb top 250 and in my opinion it is there on merit. I would thoroughly recommend anybody watch this film but please pay attention and you will enjoy the experience that much more.,

But after going many years without seeing ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" I played the DVD at home just before Christmas this year and saw much more than I had remembered of the film in the past.

213,28 December 2009,oneillrobyn,5, I don't like it,"I am definitely in the minority regarding ""Wonderful Life"". I have avoided seeing this movie for years ... and I finally gave in just before Christmas 2009. It was Christmas Eve and I discovered why I was so depressed on the holiday. I really can't stand this movie. The original problem I had with it was when I first saw it many many years ago. I didn't like the idea that ""Mary"" needed glasses and was ""ugly"", and a lonely prim librarian without Jimmy Stewart in her life. No, I am not a librarian, but I love spending time in libraries with all the knowledge books have to offer. I felt this was gratuitous and insulting. In addition, couldn't ""Mary"" have found another husband? I resented those old movies where all the those poor, struggling people live in large, comfortable old houses, even if the hero's mother ran a boarding house. I think Frank Capra's films are phony and the products of an immature mind. Another Christmasy movie is my favorite one: ""The Bishop's Wife"". It's sophisticated, witty and beautiful, and has much stronger actors than any of Capra's films, with the exception of Henry Travers who, as far as I am concerned, is the real star of ""Wonderful Life"". Even Lionel Barrymore is wasted in ""Life"".",

The drama, comedy, and heartfelt sentimentality are all woven together into a seamless masterpiece. It portrays the bitter struggle for the future of Bedford Falls between egalitarian Bailey and hard-nosed miser Mr Potter (Lionel Barrymore). One of the best of James Stewart's films, and that is saying something, and given a magic touch by director Frank Capra, with Donna Reed looking unbelievable, and Thomas Mitchell as the kindly but careless partner who manages to misplace the deposit that ultimately sends the picture into overdrive, it is the best holiday movie out there with the possible exception of the 1951 version of Scrooge.",

216,26 December 2019,jayjaycee,10, Life is wonderful,"""It's A Wonderful Life"" is a 1946 drama directed by Frank Capra starring James Stewart and Donna Reed. Just as ""Die Hard"" belongs to Christmas Eve, this all time favourite belongs to the first day of Christmas. While the first one is still arguable, no one can deny that this Capra classic is the best Christmas film of all time. Not only is it featured or referenced in literally ever other holiday flick, it's the epitome of Christmas spirit. Even if you haven't been in the mood before, this film will get you right into it. Saying it's perfect still feels like an understatement to me. I hands down can't find anything that I'd consider as a flaw. It's flawless, least to say. With every year I get older, I get more and more into the phenomenally written narration about the life of a man who struggles balancing his personal dreams and his moral obligations. James Stewart acts brilliantly in this and I'd consider George Bailey as probably his best performance of all time. It's an outstandingly scripted drama, well paced and extremely detailed in its narrative structure. The dialogue and the characters downright brim over with originality and personality, the constellations between them are eminently well elaborated and enable the viewer to feel with each and everyone of them immensely. Although the film runs for roughly two hours it always felt like a three hour epic, but not even in a negative way. What the film furthermore managed to capture magnificently is the essence of the drama. One can literally feel the inner conflict of George when he over and over decides against his dreams and his desires in favour of what others expect him to do and what he feels obligated to do. In so many scenes, this everlasting conflict finds it's way back in and reminds him of his own misery. That's how the whole situation builds up to the final act. It's all sensitively narrated and although many consider it so, never becomes a bit cheesy. Also, it has a lot of classic metaphors and a prominent symbolism in it, particularly the scene when George throws a stone in the window of the old abandoned house. He wished for his dreams to come true, when Mary tosses her's she wishes for him to be with her forever. This is the exact moment when everything he's planned slowly begins to fall apart. It's scenes like these that make the amateur writer in my so happy, it's just a master class of a screenplay. But after all this drama, I'm glad that they decided to go in a more uplifting direction in the end and worship life instead of condemning it. No matter what, the final scene gives me goosebumps every single time. All in all, this drama is a masterpiece and a textbook example of a timeless classic, with both an excellent story and magnificent performances that will hit you right in the feels and remind you that life is the most precious gift of them all. It tells us that it's okay to sometimes be unhappy and struggle with serious issues, because in the end we are not alone and all have friends and family even if it doesn't seem so. Sometimes we feel less important than we actually are to our beloved ones, but we are never alone. Having said this, merry Christmas and remember: You are being loved!",

Frank Capra chose James Steward to play George Bailey, a young idealistic young man who believes he is destined to travel the world and make a fortune. It's a great dream, but unfortunately will never happen. Instead, George is forced into an obscure existence, as he admires his father so much it dooms him to replace the old man in Bedford Falls. The Bailey family establishes a tiny savings and loan and attempts to compete with the richest man in town, Mr. Potter played to the hilt by Lionel Barrymore. Things are bad enough when Mr. Bailey dies, just as George is about to go to college, but then he is forced to replacing him as head of the S & L. Years go by and Mr. Potter takes advantage of the 1930's depression and his domination of the town is nearly complete. The second world war descends on the town and directly after a economic calamity caused by George's uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) threatens the family business by accidentally losing $8,000. Facing bankruptcy, George panics and believes he is going to be arrested. Knowing this will destroy his family, ruin his reputation and send him to prison, George opts to commit suicide. Praying for a miracle, George is hoping his insurance policy will save his family. However, an instant before he jumps into the frigid, frozen winter waters of the river, George is startled to see a strange little man jumping in first. That is when George's life enters the world of the ""What if."" The stranger (Henry Travers) turns out to be an angel named Clarence, who shows him what life would be had he never been born. In this alternative world George watches with astonishment as all those he knew are changed forever by his absence. Potter is in fact the richest and most powerful man who indeed owns the town. George on the other hand becomes a total stranger and terrorizes his own wife (Donna Reed), mother (Beulah Bondi) and children. He is subsequently run out of town by his former friends Ward Bond and Frank Faylen and neighbors. Repeated yearly as one of the finest Christmas films of all time, the movie has indeed become a family Classic. One of Jimmy Steward's all time favorites. ****",

224,26 April 2011,geminiredblue,10, It Certainly Is!!!,"Frank Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, loved by critics and viewers alike. Well, most. So much has been said that praises this heart-warming tale of George Bailey that I won't bother going over the same stuff. What I will talk about instead is the other side of the film. While most see it as a holiday movie, at the core is a dark and powerful story. George has spent all of his life wanting to go out into the world, go to college, do amazing stuff, travel the globe, and whatnot. However, every chance he gets, he's faced with a moral dilemma: Do the right thing, or go his own way. Inevitably, George winds up doing the right thing, which almost always conflicts with what he really wants to do. As the years roll by, we see his life develop in unexpected ways. At the heart, George is a terrific guy who has chosen to put others before himself. He's made a ton of sacrifices, but in ways he's taken his life for granted. And on one fateful Christmas day, a ""monetary"" bomb is dropped into the midst of his life that totally throws him off. Distressed and hurting, George feels there is no way out but to end his life. And that's where the Almighty steps in and sends down help in the form of a kindly, rotund angel named Clarence. Ultimately, what Clarence grants to George is the opportunity to see what life would've been like without him. And this is the where the movie takes its darkest turn. We see that every person's life, even the town of Bedford Falls itself, has been corrupted by the absence of George. And after George asks to live again, we begin to understand that despite whatever trouble is coming for him, it's better to face it alive. Some have complained that the bad guy, Mr. Potter, doesn't get his comeuppance in the end. But I say, Mr. Potter will one day get his own tale, in the form of ""A Christmas Carol."" Until then, George learns what life really means: No matter the turmoils, no matter whether you're rich or poor, life is the richest reward you can be given. And that is what makes IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE such a classic, because anybody who lives long enough must face the reality of both the good and the bad in their own lives. When they sing Auld Lang Syne at the end, it does mark a new year. It's the new year for George Bailey, and anyone else who's faced similar dilemmas in life. Plus, if ever there was a mainstream (secular) movie to convince us that there is a God and angels that watch over us, this is the movie to do it. So, keep ringing those bells every Christmas!",

Due to a clerical error (or should we better choose to say, divine intervention?) the film even went into public domain, and well, now that it can be shown by every station on the planet it has turned into the ultimate Christmas classic, all ages aboard. The picture might look a tad dated in parts, but on the other hand this is exactly what embeds this fantastic journey even better between fairy-tale and harsh reality.

It's a Wonderful Life not only appeals to one's Christmas spirits, but is able to exhibit deep rooted human conditions of failure, lack of faith, and discontentness, while proving the love we share with each other, as individuals, is the true gift of both Christmas and life. Such messages and themes are uninfluenced by time and age. Not only is It's a Wonderful Life a perfect Christmas movie, but one that all can learn from.",
233,20 December 2012,bayardhiler,10, It Truly Is A Wonderful Life,"In 1946, America, and the rest of the world for that matter, had just witnessed and won the most destructive war in mankind's history. They were trying to rebuild their lives from this and the Great Depression as well and as such, Hollywood got into the act by producing a number of movies that instilled hope in their audiences. Perhaps the greatest of these movies is Frank Capra's timeless film ""Its A Wonderful Life"" staring the late, great James Stewart as everyday man George Bailey in small town America, Bedford Falls. George has spent his entire life in Bedford Falls, longing to see the outside world but never able to get past the confines of the small savings and loans that he is in charge of. Then, one Christmas Eve, George's Uncle, Billy (played by the memorable character actor Thomas Mitchell) makes a terrible mistake that could ruin them both forever and George begins to think that everything would be better without him. It just so happens that heaven hears his and others' prays and sends an angel named Clarence (played by the understated but talented Henry Travers) to show him how wrong he is. In a Scrooge like role, we also have the great Lionel Barrymore in an excellent performance of Henry Potter, ""the richest and meanest man in town"" and in her most famous role, Donna Reed as George's loving and devoted wife. This is a movie that will make you laugh, maybe make you cry, and leave you with a sense that no matter how bad things get, there is always hope. ""Its A Wonderful Life"" is by far the greatest Christmas movie that has ever been produced and for that matter, will ever have been produced due to the time that it was made in and its message of how we all affect our fellow man, often times without even realizing it. So, I urge you to watch this movie and take in its message of hope and also, remember, no man is a failure as long as he has friends. 10 out of 10.",

235,29 March 2006,moonspinner55,7, Fantasy Americana (with a somber undercurrent),"Heartwarming Frank Capra film which has become (quite unintentionally, I presume) a Christmas perennial. Set in small town America, James Stewart stars as a discouraged and suicidal banker who learns a lesson about life from an angel anxious to get his wings. Fantasy with a holiday theme took many years to garner its classic status, yet it's a shrewd mixture of comedic, dramatic, and emotional elements. Capra's direction is quite sensitive, creating an evocative overview of middle America and the struggling working class. Stewart gives his usual sterling performance, and Donna Reed is a good romantic screen match for him; Henry Travers is the perfect twinkle-eyed old angel. Capra also co-adapted the screenplay based on the short story ""The Greatest Gift"" (which seems to have a touch of Dickens as well). Later remade as the 1977 TV movie ""It Happened One Christmas"", which featured Marlo Thomas in the lead. *** from ****",

By God, I was stupefied, I did not write a review immediately just to see if this was not a flash in the pan, just an overdone, emotional blackmailer of a movie but this movie is simply brilliant.

237,27 December 2010,larry41onEbay,10," Notes from my recent intro, I have five favorite scenes...","Notes from my recent intro, I have five favorite scenes: the shared phone call; the hat tipping rainwater in the doorway; the prayer at the bar; when snow starts falling again on the bridge and the brother toast in the closing scene. IAWL partially succeeds because of its small town charm and values. James Stewart was from a small town -- Indiana, Pennsylvania (now his museum needs a Capra miracle). You may not know this but Stewart was a real WWII hero, enlisting as a private in 1941. He flew over 20 missions and when he finally retired from the reserves it was as a brigadier general. (true story) Frank Capra was from a small town, Bisacquino, Sicily and during WWII he made a series of films called, Why We Fight. And on a personal note, Frank Capra is my favorite director because his movies inspire me. Back in the 1980's I used to write him and call him on our birthdays to chat. Donna Reed in real life was an Iowa farm girl. She sweetens the film and is lovely, innocent and pure representing both Stewarts reward and proof that he made the right choice. Trivia: ""The Greatest Gift"" story did not sell so the author Philip Van Doren Stern had copies printed and included them in the Christmas cards he sent out in 1943. Just like The Wizard Of Oz, IAWL did not cover its high cost upon its original release and was deemed a box office flop. And although Oscar nominated for Best Film, Director and Star it received no Academy Awards. Frank Capra wrote in his autobiography that he closed his book on the film. He thought his dream was over But something had happened, fans found the film and wrote to him, mostly praising some complaining but they kept writing. Decades later he was still answering letters, but the studio forgot about the film and it fell into public domain. In the 1970s, hundreds of TV stations started to play it every holiday season because they did not have to pay royalties. And so people had the chance to see it more than once and with repeated viewings word of mouth began to build and spread. But I'm here to tell you it's not the only one. There are dozens, no make that hundreds of films nearly this good just waiting to be discovered. I'll toss out a few titles: MEET JOHN DOE; YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU; MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON; LOST HORIZON and MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN. Anybody know who directed those masterpieces? I have a hand written letter I got back in the 1980s that reads,""Dear Larry, Frank Capra was a fine director with high ideals who was able to put them up on the big screen without preaching. Sincerely, James Stewart."" Well find some friends & family to watch it with you and then sit back for some fun, and enjoy this gift from Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart. Or better yet, see it the way they meant for it to be shared, on THE BIG SCREEN just before Christmas. And one last thing, I am sure they would want me to wish you  be sure to have a Wonderful Life!",

I have seen it 50+ times & never get tired of it. During the year if I feel a little down I will pop in the DVD, (B&W only), watch a few scenes or the whole movie & I will feel much better!
The acting, directing, script & cinematography are spot on! It deserved to win many Academy Awards but had the misfortune of being up against The Best Years of Our Lives, also a very good movie. I recommend anyone not having seen it to give it a look see 👀!",
240,25 December 2020,annarcario,10, Every time a bell rings an angel gets his wings,"I am back, I have been busy with college, but now you hear a ton from me to make up for lost time. Earlier today, my mom suggested we watch. It's A Wonderful life, which I have wanted to watch ever since I watched The first episode of The Five Who Came Back, a documentary TV series. Though many people I talked to today. Hate black and white movies because of the length of the movie introduction. I find that kids today; are used to watching movies in color and faster intros to the characters and stories. It's a Wonderful Life is a beautiful classic for any time of year though most people will likely watch it at Christmas time. Yet, it could be possible to watch this movie at any time of the year because the movie's message. The main protagonist is George Bailey, who dreams of leaving his small town to explore the world. However, other things in his life get in the way and take over the family business. He starts putting the more needs of the town over his desires. Even though eventually, he slowly resent his actions. The hidden message that sometimes we must set aside our own wants in life for the greater good. The second message is more stands out more George Bailey eventually decides that it is better to end it all and never even be born. Luckily, he meets his Guardian Angel, who shows him how his life affects the people around him. This encounter enforces the message that even though sometimes we feel like our lives are insignificant. The movie's message shows us that we do touch others that we meet throughout our lives. This movie was directed by Capra, who creates a story of a human life that is not only one character but also involves the audience in the characters' lives. Overall, Capra Has shown throughout many movies in my research that many of his characters face adversity. Carp has an overall optimism about the human condition by showing the strength it takes for humans to overcome difficult challenges. It's a Wonderful Life additionally stars Donna Reed as George's wife excellent performance, a supportive wife, and inspirational throughout the film. Lionel Barrymore gives a convincing performance as the greedy businessman who wants to take over the town. after watching this movie, I glad I watched this it: put a smile on my face and made me forget about the times we live in for a little bit",

I like to think of this movie as something to watch whenever you are depressed or feeling low, cause it definitely helps.Not only to be seen as a Christmas movie, it shows us that anyone can make a difference.

Most of the reason people really enjoy this movie is because of the sentiment they have while watching it with family and friends. Although, while watching the movie, I wasn't constantly thinking about how old the movie was. The story and the acting was captivating enough to make me forget about the old style. I've seen some reviews about how the movie told a depressing message about why you shouldn't take risks in your life and just stay where you're needed. However, I think the movie just tries to tell a message that there is meaning in life even when things are looking down; a slight change of perspective can change your whole outlook on life. Overall, a lighthearted movie with a meaningful message.",

244,22 February 2021,miaalike,10, Most human movie ever,"This movie is not easy to watch. Al least that was my experience. At first I saw it on TV long time ago and mostly paid attention to the snowy, Christmassy atmosphere. Then one year I got caught into really watching it and it was the first time I understood it. Or at least I thought so. Then I watched it with the people I care about and it was a shared experience and I felt a bit bad for the tears, mine and thr other person's. Because having a closed heart can provide the illusion of safety, and movies that open those gates are, well, an intimate thing, as well as a risky one. You may feel again things that took an effort to set aside, in a protective move. Then there was a time I would avoid seeing it at Christmas, and someone else insisted. But no, I did not want to go there anymore, thinking about humanity in sad, yet kind and blisfull terms. Or perhaps not thinking, feeling... The most recent time I watched it, I saw new things. It seemed to me the movie has Easter Eggs here and there, also the main character story, I just understood it differently. It is about a man (it can be a woman, just anybody in fact, the story is just a ""guide""), who lives his life while dreaming of living a different one. He has a job, family and children and he has to fight some really evil type of a man, runs into trouble and just wishes he was never born to begin with. For him, the life he lead was plan B, anyways. Surely, he got attached to it, but his dreams were so different! And then he gets the chance to see why things were the way they were, why it was so important for him to live this plan B life. Watch the movie. You might find it helps, if only by reminding us what being human may be all about.",

246,12 January 2023,PaulusLoZebra,10, We need to watch a movie about pure Goodness from time to time,"It's a Wonderful Life is a film about pure Goodness. In our world we need to watch a film like this from time to time, to remind us that we have agency and that it matters what we and each individual does every day. Even if we think that do-gooders can cause problems, that what they do is not perfectly good, we need to see this film, because it reminds us to think about values. Frank Capra believed in social responsibility, in the community, in ordinary people helping each other. Jimmy Stewart's performance is justifiably legendary, but I was drawn to Donna Reed, because she is the true moral compass of the film, even more than the angel Clarence ! Jimmy is torn and goes back and forth about what to do with his life, although he always makes the humane decision, never the selfish one. But Donna is quietly decisive, unerring, instinctive, intelligent and radiant - no angst.",

The deep emotions and the role one can play in life is well expressed in one of the most wonderful ways. The angel is just symbolic of what if not.

What I like about this movie is that it isn't a classic Christmas movie: the movie isn't about how things get better overnight for the main character just because he/she 'believes in Christmas', or some idiocy like that. Christmas just plays a small, but great role in the final part of the movie, which is, ultimately, about life.",

Two special moments: Stewart's tears as he sits in martinis, and the scene where Mary and George both listen to the same telephone receiver. Its such a magical scene - one of the best scenes of all time. Neither of them listen to what Sam Wainwright is saying on the phone, because all of a sudden the two of them realise they are standing the closest they've been together in twenty or so years.

It's an American classic, you don't need more. If this was a European movie, it would get bad critics and ratings. But with the Americans we tolerate it. They are like that. The film they like best is the film with the happiest happy-end that is so happy that it's already in the title. Where I live, they dare to show it once a year, at Christmas, and that's it. It's typical for the American people that they adore movies where someone is shown by  God Himself how much the world needs him! That's what gives them hope that their own life isn't meaningless. The problem is: That man the film is about has in most cases nothing to do with them. He is an angel himself, saved two people's life and gave homes to many poor people in a small village. Who else can say that about oneself? The plot is constructed, so the film isn't valuable to give you hope and people who realize that are rather made sad then happy.",
259,8 September 2014,panchodh_12,10, I cried. A lot.,"I don't think I would be able of ever cast an objective statement regarding the quality of this movie. It's not one of this movies I can objectively say which rating does it deserve in a 1 to 10 scale, because it reached something in me way beyond objectifiable maths and numbers. Yes, it may sound super cheesy, but it did reach my heart. I don't even know how it happened, but it was definitely a slow, progressive proccess. The more you get to know George's life, the more difficult it is to wish the best for that man even if he doesn't exist beyond the flat screen. Art is very much about creating an illusion of reality, and some say that if an art piece doesn't cast a spell on you that makes you believe you're appreciating the real world, then it is bad art. When you're reading a novel and you're able to abstract from it and make sense of the fact that all the characters are just plane words on a blank page, is because the spell was not correctly cast and the book you're reading is a bad one. Well, at some point during the movie I stopped to think why on earth was I so touched by just a bunch of pixels in my computer's screen, because I couldn't understand how could I care so much for a person that doesn't even exist. I guess that the answer to that is that people like George do exist, and we're surrounded everywhere by those people who make our lives better, and that sometimes life doesn't give back to them what they deserve. I guess that's the reason why, in the last scene, I just started to cry like a baby, not just a timid tear, but lots of them, up until the movie finished. I don't remember having cried this way for a movie before. I still need to digest this movie, it'll take me a while.",

I watched this film for the first time last night on Christmas Eve, 2007, and all I have to say is that, besides being close to tears when it was finished, it made me feel blissful. Now feeling happy is not too exciting, but this film made me feel absolutely cherry. It is the kind of movie that, were I to be abandoned on an island and I could only choose five movies, this would most certainly be one of them. The film is oddly scary in that it is truthful...not in the sense that angels will come down and make a man continue to live, but in the sense that is shows what would have happened had someone never lived in a fashion that is entirely realistic.",

An era where people were forced to make do with less, Capra's movies featured a protagonist whose quaint, homespun values brought pompous powerbrokers down a couple of pegs.

It is a movie that opens with a fantastical scene of a star, later revealed to be an angel, talking to a faceless God, the voice-over obvious, stilted in sweet humour, and immediately suggesting the film is going to be one that is too saccharine a pill to swallow. The thing is, beyond that, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is the ultimate exercise in feel-good cinema, its virtue as such much parodied and referenced in TV and other films.",

The film follows the journey of George Bailey, a man who must learn the valuable life lesson that ""No man is a failure who has friends.""
George's major flaw lies in his belief that he is superior to others and doesn't need any friends.

274,5 December 2021,tarwaterthomas,10, I have got to review this movie....,"....because it is the greatest Christmas classic ever filmed, and what's ironic is that it was a box office bellyflop at its initial release in December, 1946 by RKO Radio Pictures. What's more, this movie wasn't even RKO's first choice. It was going to be SINBAD THE SAILOR with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. And Maureen O'Hara. But because IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE was filmed in black and white at the behest of master filmmaker Frank Capra, this movie was released first and the Arabian Nights epic was released in 1947. Anyways, this movie was a comeback for Frank Capra and James Stewart, both of whom has served during the Second World War; Capra made documentaries while Stewart was a bomber pilot in the European Theater of Operations. James Stewart owned completely the role of small town banker George Bailey who has spent his entire life in the little Midwestern town of Bedford Falls; repeated attempts to leave his little town have ended in complete failure. One night, George Bailey scrams out of his rundown house because he is about to commit suicide! Repeated prayers are heard by the Almighty, and there are two senior angels who are in deep discussion as to what to do about George Bailey, so they call on Guardian Angel Second Class Clarence Oddbody (played con brio by Henry Travers) who still hasn't gotten his wings and his fellow angels are starting to talk. So we enter flashback territory, when George as a little boy saves his brother Harry from falling through the ice and drowning as he slid down to the frozen pond on a spade. George loses hearing in his left ear, though. He works part time in a drugstore owned by Mr. Gower (H. B. Warner) and see the distraught druggist poisoning a child's prescription, and prevents Gower from doing so even though he gets a slap right across the chips but apologizes afterward. George Bailey grows up some and plans a worldwide tour before going to college and is reintroduced to Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) who has had a crushy crush on him ever since she was a little girl. It goes both ways. But before he takes off, his father (played by Samuel S. Hinds) dies from a stroke brought on by the avaricious Henry Potter (Lionel Barrymore in a once in a lifetime performance) who has wanted to get his meathooks on Bailey Savings and Loan; the greedy SOB controls everything else in Bedford Falls. Potter wants to dissolve it, you see. But if George Bailey runs the financial institution, the board will be able to keep the building. George gets to work alongside his absent-minded Uncle Billy Bailey (Thomas Mitchell), and gives his tuition money to brother Harry (Todd Karns) with the understanding that Harry will take over when he graduates. Unfortunately for George, Harry comes back to Bedford Falls from college having gotten married and with job offer from his rich father-in-law. Aw, damn. So George winds up running the savings and loan, and gets married to Mary Hatch. There's a beautiful wedding, lots of happy tears, and $2000 to start their lives together. But they have to pass by the bank in order to catch a train at the depot, and wouldn't you know, as it's the Great Depression there's a run on the bank and a bunch of panicked customers. George pleads with them to keep their money at Bailey Savings and Loan. But there's word that moneybags Potter will pay the customers 50 cents on the dollar. But just when the smelly stuff is hitting the fan and Potter is taunting George over the telephone line, Mary enters the bank with their honeymoon money and after reimbursing the customers, there is two bucks left over by the 6:00 pm deadline. In due course, a housing development known as Bailey Park is built, rivaling Potter's expensive slum neighborhoods. Potter offers Bailey a job worth $20,000 yearly but declines when it turns out that Potter still intends to shut down the savings and loan. George Bailey had no choice but sit out World War II because of his hearing loss. Harry receives the Congressional Medal of Honor for shooting down a Japanese fighter that was about to do a kamikaze number on a transport plane. Flash forward to Christmas Eve, 1945, as Bedford Falls is about to welcome home Harry Bailey and George and Billy are about to deposit $8,000 in the savings and loan and Henry Potter just happens to be at the bank. Billy goofs on the moneybags, accidentally stashes the eight grand in Potter's newspaper. Potter finds the money but the bastard says nothing, just steals the money. And Uncle Billy thinks he just misplaced the money. George harangues his uncle, calls him a stupid, weak, useless old man, and hares off to home, yells at his family, and runs off in the night. And just as he is about to take his own life, Clarence Oddbody jumps into an icy river, and George saves his life. And Clarence gets to show George what life would be like without him. Bedford Falls does not exist; instead it's called Potterville and it is a neon hellhole. Casinos, gambling houses, pawnshops by the bushel, dance halls. George Bailey's mother Ma Bailey (Beulah Bondi) is an embittered widow, ever since the savings and loan shut down during the Great Depression; Mary Hatch became a repressed spinster working at the library; town flirt Violet Bick (Gloria Grahame) is arrested by the cops and is dragged kicking and screaming into a paddy wagon; the crime rate is off the charts; there are amoral townspeople looking for cheap thrills of all kinds; Gower the drugstore owner went to jail for manslaughter and Is reduced to panhandling, on account of he poisoned the pills and killed a young boy; Uncle Billy Bailey was sent to a mental institution after the savings and loans went out of business; where Bailey Park once stood there is s graveyard where Harry Bailey is buried. Harry in this alternate world did not live to serve during WWII, so of course he didn't save the soldiers on the transport plane. In other words, George Bailey has been a tremendous influence. He pleads with Clarence Oddbody to return to his own world, and the wish is granted. So even though George Bailey may be off to the jailhouse, his friends and neighbors show up with money and checks, do it looks like the savings and loan will stay open. George Bailey has been the most selfless man around, which was why he got in big trouble. What a gray example of filmmaking. Did you know that this movie was remade for TV in 1977 as IT HAPPENED ONE CHRISTMAS with Marlo Thomas as Mary Bailey Hatch and Wayne Rogers as George Hatch. Yeah, that girl worked on this fractured flicker and shoved her feminist point of view down everyone's throat. She got Cloris Leachman to play Clara Oddbody and cast Orson Welles as Henry Potter. And then there was another TV movie called ODDBODY (1990) with Robert Carradine as Clarence Oddbody. But accept no substitutions. Stick with the original. It's hard to believe that IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE was in the public domain during the 1970s and,1980s. Every Christmas, this amazing movie was on every TV station. But then a revived Republic Pictures purchased this movie's copyright and took it out of the public domain; the copyright has since gone over to Paramount. And these days NBC has the exclusive broadcast rights to the film. But it's available on home video and you can stream it, too. You owe yourself the duty and responsibility to watch the James Stewart classic. Do that. You can thank me later.",

291,18 December 2006,tavm,10, Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart's It's a Wonderful Life is my all-time favorite,"Since I first saw this classic in 1981, I've seen an episode of Laverne and Shirley with this premise (it's Laverne who imagines this scenario), a musical version on stage with Ernie the taxi driver-not Martini-owning a bar, and last year a Baton Rouge Little Theater presentation with dialogue almost taken verbatim from the movie. Nothing however compares to the original film interpretation. How can one not laugh when George (Jimmy Stewart) and Mary (Donna Reed) accidentally fall into the high school gym swimming pool after Mary ditched a potential suitor (Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer)? Or not get touched by George's speech defending his late father to Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore)? Certainly the last hour as George feels the world tumbling before him and his eventual appreciation of his life are some of the most tear-and-laugh inducing scenes I've ever seen in the movies or television. It's a Wonderful Life has always been my favorite movie and nothing I've ever seen has even come close. Kudos to Stewart and director Frank Capra for such a life-affirming project. Thanks also to Barrymore, Reed, Switzer, Samuel S. Hinds (George's father Peter), Beulah Bondi (George's mom), Thomas Mitchell (Uncle Billy), H.B. Warner (Gower the druggist), Gloria Grahame (Violet Bick), Lilian Randolph (Annie the maid), Sheldon Leonard (Nick the bartender), Ward Bond (Bert the cop), Frank Faylen (Ernie the taxi driver), Bill Edmunds (Martini), and Charles Lane in his role as the guy who tells Potter about George's Bailey Park plans for filling the picture with, in Nick's words ""a little atmosphere"". Add to that all the various kid and adult actors I can't remember right now. And finally, special thanks to Henry Travers (Clarence) for making us all believe in angels. No truer words have ever been written as the one in Clarence's book gift (The Adventures of Tom Sawyer) to George: No man is a failure who has friends. Though one may quibble about Harry not being saved without George despite other friends near him or Mary becoming an old maid, It's a Wonderful Life is a flawless masterpiece that has stood the test of time for the last 60 years. May it stand forevermore. P.S. Look for the Blondie movie series' kid stars Larry ""Baby Dumpling/Alexander Bumstead"" Simms (George's son Pete) and Danny ""Alvin Fuddle"" Mummert (Little Marty Hatch). And Ellen ""Grandma Walton"" Corby as the woman George kisses in the run-on-the-bank sequence. Update: 12/25/2020-I just watched the colorized version from Legend Films. While I noticed some detail concerning background and extras I hadn't previously noticed before, I didn't let myself get too distracted by that colorization since except for the skies during the night scene, I didn't notice any scenes that seemed to still be in the original b & w like I did when the first colorization was done by Hal Roach Studios during the late '80s.

299,22 April 2008,film-critic,10, The Big-Box Swindle of Bedford Falls,"For many, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is a staple to their holiday traditions. With all major networks vying to get their hands on this mediocre blockbuster, this little film transforms from ordinary to cult status every holiday. As a viewer, outside of the final act, this Jimmy Stewart classic is more than just a Christmas movie, but instead a powerful Capra film that demonstrates an America from long ago. It shows a small-town America, without the plowed Wal-Mart roads or big-box makeovers. For this critic, it demonstrates the power of independent business, and why we may never find this type of service ever again. As an independent, downtown shop owner of about a year and a half myself; ""It's A Wonderful Life"" transformed this viewing from holiday pastime to dedicated film exposing the corruptive nature of capitalism as well as the realism of independent business. With this change in tact, Jimmy Stewart's words become more emotional, Donna Reed's actions become more honest, and our little Christmas film transforms into a man's journey to search for himself. I cannot denounce that this is a holiday film, Stewart screams ""Merry Christmas"" throughout the entire ending, but before that final conclusion there are about two hours of small town America and one man's struggle to escape. ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is a powerful blend of realism and fantasy, individualism and community, dreams and truth, as well as frustration and joy. The cast is superbly placed in their respective roles and Capra's action behind the camera stands boldly in place. This is not just a movie, but an experience coupled with foreshadowing  giving George not just a glimpse of a world without him  but also a glimpse of a world without small business ",

301,30 December 2018,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,2, It's Wonderful Tripe,"This is Hollywood saccharine at its most deadly.
Jimmy Stewart is the bumbling owner/manager of the local hick town's
Savings & Loan but his grasp of economics is so feable only a country of dirt farmers and unemployed laborers who think FDR was some kind of genius would buy this drivel. I was actually surprised to learn that upon release, movie-goers were wise enough to reject this movie. Only to see it revived for audiences decades later when it became part of the public domain so TV station could show it for free. Come to think of it, that explains everything - the movie sorta rests on a ''free sh^t for everyone"" theme so why shouldn't it have grown popular by being a feel-good movie families watched for free on TV at Christmas while the local TV station padded its bottom line at virtually zero cost to them.
The bank owner played by Barrymore is so broadly brushed as an evil capitalist I'm surprised Capra didn't get hauled in front of HUAC or Sen. McCarthy.
The first 2/3 of the movie where Stewart stumbles from one misfortune to another is so turgidly paced and insipidly acted I couldn't wait for him to, um, do something about it. The final 1/3 with the Ghost of Christmas Past shtick wasn't terribly fresh or interesting, either.
This movie is easily one of the most over-rated of all time.",
302,29 November 2019,ChristianLeFeuvre,10," Christmas wouldn't be the same without watching this classic, it's a 'MUST SEE'","Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed star in this incredible movie, which has now become a Christmas classic, with scenes from it even featuring in other Christmas movies, notably the 2 first 'Home Alone's, and it is frequently found on lists of the greatest films ever made.
It was directed by Frank Capra and, when first released in 1946, was not a box office hit at all. However, since then it has become almost a Christmas tradition, screened every year, especially in the States, and although the premise seems rather glum, it is one of the most uplifting and heartwarming films you could see.
The film follows the story of George Bailey, played by Stewart. We first meet George as a young kid filled with dreams. As an adult though, those dreams have to be set aside as he takes over his father's business so it doesn't fall into the hands of the town's nasty business tycoon Mr Potter, he puts the happiness and well-being of other people before his own, and he doesn't really realise the impact the good he does for others has on the people he knows, family, friends and the people of the town of Bedford Falls. All this good though has stopped him from fulfilling his dreams and desires, especially for travel and this leaves him slightly frustrated. Despite having a beautiful wife, four children and the affection and respect from the people of Bedford Falls, something happens which sends him into huge despair and he decides to end his life.
This is when we meet Clarence, an angel (second class, which means he hasn't earned his wings yet), who is sent down to Earth to save George and show him that his life is worth more than he knows, this help will also allow Clarence to gain his wings.
Showing George what life would be like for family, friends and the town if he had never been born, this sparks the realisation in him that he does have a 'wonderful life'.
There is a really strong message in this movie that you should be happy with what you have, and you never know just how much your actions affect the lives of others.
I love this film and the message it holds really speaks to me, I try my hardest to do what I can for others and make sure I put the well-being of other people before my own.
The pace of this movie is terrific, despite being over 2 hours, it doesn't feel like that, it moves along so quickly. Watching old black & white films from that time now, you can't help but notice the acting in so many, is very 'stage' like and quite overdone, the actors in this though give the most incredible performances which feel so genuine and real. Jimmy Stewart did say in an interview, that even though 'Harvey' was his favourite of all his movies, George Bailey was his favourite character to play.
Donna Reed who plays 'Mary' is terrific, Henry Travers as angel 'Clarence' is just superb, and his portrayal is beautifully child-like and naive. Lionel Barrymore plays the town's villainous 'Mr Potter' with suitable menace...just brilliant.
The set is truly astounding, and the movie received 5 Oscar nominations and won 1 for Technical Achievement as it broke new ground with special effects and visuals, including the first use in movies of a new kind of snow. The direction, cinematography, sound, and production in this film are all outstanding.
If you haven't seen 'It's A Wonderful Life' yet, even though it was made in the forties, it doesn't look dated at all, it is a movie that is timeless, and will remain so. It's a film that people enjoy watching alone or with their families, and don't mind watching again and again.
And remember, ""Every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings"".",

Although George Bailey was the almost perfected emotional core of every man and woman's heart, Frank Capra delivered the darkest yet of three movies featuring one of his best stars.

After all these viewings I have two questions for Frank Capra or anyone who loves this movie.
The first question is when George rescues his brother Harry. We are told by the second angel educating Clarence about George that he saved Harry's life - (George, Marty, Sammy and other friends were sliding down a snow covered hill on coal shovels onto ice and sliding across the ice covering a small pond open at the far end to the pond's water. Harry slid too far and fell in. George jumps in to save Harry), but he caught a bad cold and his left ear became infected and he lost his hearing in that ear. It was ""weeks"" before he was able to return to his after school job at Old Man Gower's drug store. The scene of the boys sliding was snow and ice - the next scene was George and his friends walking after school to George's after school job. The key word for me that raises my question is the word ""weeks"" because leaves were on the trees a very fast transition from the snow covered pond. I think a better word would be months. Another clue is that on the telegram the date is May. Any ice and snow would have melted back in March.
The second question is if Potter spends his time in a wheelchair, how does he get around with only the help of his large assistant? How would he AND the wheelchair get up the steep stairs at the Bailey Bros. Building and Loan? Does the assistant take the chair up first then returns and carries Potter. The chair looks like it's made of solid wood and is very heavy by itself. Are there duplicate chairs placed in Potter's office and places he does business so the chair does not have to be considered? And how does he get up into his horse drawn carriage? It seems so easy for Potter to be anywhere. Perhaps Capra is counting on our imagination? Any answers out there?",

311,13 September 2010,ThreeThumbsUp,9, A Christmas classic,"It's a Wonderful Life is as much a part of Christmas to me as stockings, candy, snow dusted-trees and shopping. It was a tradition for our family to watch this movie every Christmas Eve before my two siblings and I were tucked into bed in anticipation for Santa Clause to visit our front door (we didn't have a chimney). I will admit that I am not usually a fan of films from this era (I gave Casablanca 5 out of 10 stars), but this feature is different. It's long, but it has to be. The storyline truly covers the main character's entire life. It all comes together in the end in divine detail. It's uplifting and romantic.

318,7 September 2020,WitnessToIt,1, Possibly the most depressing movie ever made. Not good in these times of isolation and economic woe.,"Wow, I don't know where to start. This movie, which for the first half is filled with charm and has good acting and so forth, wounds up ultimately telling the viewer than UNLESS they have a ton of friends, their life means NOTHING.
The fact is - and it was easy to suspend disbelief while watching this for a while - that in real life, many people are in dire straits financially, and they don't have a group of friends let alone a whole town who will come to their rescue if they fall into a hole of economic disaster. This is a movie that should not be watched by those who suffer from depression, or are living alone, in isolation, such as 2020 has unfortunately brought upon us - we live in a time where the richest, most evil person who controls things is not obviously evil, does not scowl, and is considered a great person because he is rich enough to control most of the media and fool a lot of good people, trick them into disaster - we live in dire times.
This movie is fine for a good while; it takes its first descent when George sits down to listen to a proposition of Potter's for him to come work with him; it's to the character's ideals that he couldn't stand shaking that awful man's hand (be Potter a caricature of evil or not, this movie is quite effective many times). The scene where there's a run on the bank and the emotions after Mary pulls out money to be used on their honeymoon, by George and by some of the people there in the bank, moved me to tears; there ARE beautiful moments in this.
However, as the movie goes on, starting with the Potter-Bailey talk, it gets darker and darker, until finally, with the loss of $8,000 (equal to near $113,000 now - and what EIGHT grand would do for many of us), with that loss begins a spiral, with George ready to kill himself; so in steps our angel Clarence, who wants his wings (yes we all know that part) and he jumps in pretending he can't swim to bring out once again the person who, even as a child, saved lives in this movie, George, to come rescue him. And so George does. And then shortly later George says he wishes he was never born and is granted this wish.
Now what comes next, this part is really hard for me to watch - and BTW, I've seen this movie since I was a child, many many times, until around 10 years ago I found it incredibly depressing, and I gave it a chance then, and I tried to now - and it's not like none of it is not moving early on, but it takes a bad turn; the scenes with George not being born is like some nightmare straight out of the Twilight Zone, though The Twilight Zone's done it better (though oddly, Capra considered bars and nightclubs and such to be the worst thing that could happen to a town? We'd all be lucky to have them going again NOW). In this world where nobody knows his name etc. we find how horrible other people's lives are without his having been born.
Imagine if YOU never had that effect on other people - we can't all, and it doesn't mean our lives don't have value or that we don't care about others - we can't all have these incredible effects on others' lives like George did; so this makes the viewer, if they're failing at things in life, feel like HELL. It CAN, anyway. Unless one is very lucky (take someone who's rich; it doesn't mean all their problems are solved, but they're less likely to feel how incredibly terrible it can be to have economic hardship; many people are unemployed now, more than ever; many people are feeling desperation now. And social isolation.
So here is this movie, which starts out as beautiful escapism, but then goes on to much more serious subjects, and basically all it takes is George saying he wants to live again, and suddenly not only is his identity back, but he and his beautiful wife (and he has children too, and a house they fixed up nicely), have THE WHOLE TOWN running to his rescue when he's about to be arrested for being $8,000 short, all to GIVE HIM MONEY. Including a cable where Sam authorizes up to 25 grand. Gee, it's a real wonderful life, huh?
The thing is, for him it is; and ideally, this is the way life should be - people helping each other out when in trouble; sharing the wealth, what little they can - it can all help so much - so that message is a good one, an important one; the problem is, after we've just seen someone suicidal and about to drown themselves, most people who would find themselves in such a situation would NOT have a whole ton of friends, a town full, to help them, let alone an angel to help save them from suicide. This is REALLY not a movie for anybody depressed, or with economic worries, or lack of friends, to be watching. And unlike what some others said, the acting in this is fine. James Stewart is fine, the whole cast is - nice to see Gloria Grahame in this (I love the movie The Big Heat).
This movie just gets too depressing.",
319,10 December 2021,zacklearman,10, There is no worthier '10',"This movie encapsulates the post-world war 2 spirit of the times perfectly.

323,12 September 2008,Cosmoeticadotcom,10, Masterpiece,"At its center, the film works because we all have wondered what would the world be like if we were never born. Have we had an impact? After all, whether it's leaving behind descendants, works of art, discoveries, or just our name, we all want some recognition, that we mattered, or at least were here. It helps define our sojourn, and allow us to extrapolate meaning from a cosmos which is random, indifferent, and so large and eternal as to defy the meager human ability to fully comprehend. With that as a base desire, the film then goes nearly two hours showing us a life that has many tangents with ours- be you an American, Mongolian, or Zulu. We see the effect George has had, even if he does not, and know what can only await him when Clarence pulls out his life's rug from under his feet- if not the particulars, certainly the general effects, which can only be negative. Yes, George may be more involved with others than the typical person, but we are all connected, however peripherally. This film does a better job than any other film in espousing the notion of The Butterfly Effect, even more so than the recent film of that name. We all see ourselves in George Bailey, for the film does not focus on George's mere home nor business lives, but all the important moments they bound, and even fail to contain. We can easily extrapolate ourselves into his position, especially at his moment of crisis, when he literally, as Potter taunts, is worth more dead than alive- at least on a material level. This toweringly great film is all about corralling the material instincts and aspects of the world, and using them for the right reasons, while appreciating the values that lie beneath those instincts. The cynics, dummies, and willful misreaders of this film be damned! It is not corny, cheesy, hokey, nor a mere feel good tearjerker, like its many inferior copycats are. Too often the commercials or excerpts that are shown damage the overall film's perception, for it's a synergistic film, whose whole far surpasses its parts. It is great art, period. It is defensible not only on an emotional level, but on intellectual and artistic levels. It is also testament to the fact that great art always rises to the surface, even if bad critics pummel it. This has an extra resonance for me and those who produce excellence with no immediate reward nor recognition. But, even without that, It's A Wonderful Life deserves its plaudits, and your viewership.",

330,13 March 2006,johno-21,10, Over rated because it so darn good,"Once, in the mid 1980's I was visiting someone at a gated community where Frank Capra owned a home and there he was standing by the guard gate talking with the gate keeper. There was Frank Capra, the director responsible for such films as It Happened One Night, Mr. Smith goes to Washington, Meet John Doe, Lost Horizon, You Can't Take it with you, Arsenic and Old Lace, Platinum Blonde and so many others but as I passed by the first film that came to mind was It's a Wonderful Life. Is this film just too indoctrinated in my mind or is it that good of a film? Well, maybe a little of both but it is that good of a film. Is this film over rated? Maybe so but even at it's critical worst it's still a great film. Jimmy Stewart shines as he leads an excellent cast of Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Henry Travers, Ward Bond and Frank Faylen among others. This film was nominated for three of the major Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor for Jimmy Stewart. It was also nominated for Best Film Editing and Best Sound. Well photographed by cinematographer Joseph F. Biroc who would have a long career in film and beautiful art direction from veteran art director Jack Oakey with music from Dimitri Tiomkin this is a well balanced piece of American Cinema. It's amazing that Capra, who would live until 1991 would only direct five more theatrical features after Wonderful Life in his long life. My only fault with this film is of no fault of the film itself but because it has become somehow the benchmark of Christmas movies and gets too much airplay during the holiday season while other great and near great Christmas-themed movies get overlooked. It's a little sentimental but dark enough not to be a Norman Rockwell painting on film and as over rated as it has become I still can't give it less than a 10.",

332,9 December 2007,blue-7,10, Colorized Version VS Black & White,"I picked up Paramount's double DVD for ""It's a Wonderful Life"" to upgrade my earlier Republic release. This two disc set comes with both the original B&W edition and a newly colorized version on a separate disc. This is not the first colorization job on this film. Turner attempted it some years back and both James Stewart and director Frank Capra were appalled at the results. They did everything in their power to discourage this practice. Well the technique for colorization has greatly improved since those early attempts and I thought it worth taking another look at the results. It is quite amazing -- yet after watching it for about one hour I changed to the black & white version and have NO desire to watch it in color. Flesh colors are on the orange side and everyone has the exact same tone of color. The beautiful shades found in the b&w version are far more effective. Let's face it -- if a film was originally designed and shot in color then it should be seen that way. It's the same with watching a wide screen film in full screen or a full screen blown up to fill a 16:9 wide screen television set. The film itself remains one of my all time favorites -- and I will continue appreciate it in black and white!",

This movie is not only one of their best, but also one of the best of that era. Based on the basic principle of cherishing the greatest gift god has given to humans - Life, this movie takes the help of fantasy to explain this point very beautifully. The movie has a very simple story, the good virtues against the bad virtues and the triumph of the human spirit in the end. But, the treatment of the story is very fresh and it still remains evergreen. A Lot of suicides are reported nowadays due to various reasons, people ending lives without thinking of their near and dear ones. A Similar situation arises in the movie with the protagonist George Bailey (Stewart), who due to bankruptcy and other reasons decide to end his life leaving his wife and four children. He is about to end his life, when a guardian angel from heaven stops him and advises him against it by saying that every life is precious and ending it would change a lot of things around. He proves his point by showing George how his town, family etc would have been if he never existed. Seeing, the dreadful situation of his family and town if he had never being born, he understands the preciousness of his life and takes the suitable decision. The movie ends on a very happy note. Only a heartless person would not have a smile on the face or perhaps a tear in the eye during the course of the climax.",

That is Crazy is what he thought. How can you help people bye charging so much INTEREST????
So he had a lot more people TRUST HIM A LOT MORE.
If you noticed in one part of the Film. One Bank wanted him to go work for them. Back in those days, it was $20 Thousand a year they offered him.
That is like $16 Hundred a Month back in the 40s.
That is a lot of money. Loved how he just basically Laughed at them and walked out of there BANK.

Who could forget his guardian angel, Clarence? and the wonderful people who make Bedford Falls, New York. The film is long but it's worth watching. Before NBC bought it, it used to be shown repeatedly around the holiday season. There was never a day without It's A Wonderful Life! Still almost every show from Married with Children to Saturday Night Live has used the story line of what it would be like if George was never born. He learns at the end that he had a wonderful life and it sends chills down your spine and tears to your eyes. It's the kind of film that you don't forget or want too. It makes us all feel important.",

I would say that there are many funny jokes contained in this film from the jokes these characters make to their actions like crashing a car in a tree to having been kicked out of a bar on the snowy ground. I would say that this movie really did teach a life lesson about caring about life and what the actions and consequences could occur if something tragic or unexpected happened. For a 1946 movie, I really enjoyed the colorful and bright colors and themes this film had to offer. From the dialogue, screenplay, and etc, I really enjoyed this Christmas film.",

Good acting and directing make this vintage gem hold up well with James Stewart well cast as the common man thrust into the hands of fate and a supporting cast who seamlessly make the film whole.

367,8 December 2022,carmelitaperezalbarran,10, Wise Words from C.P.A,I liked this movie a lot mainly because it had a bit of everything. It was fun because of the way the story was well made. And the music helped tie all the scenes together well. There was ad moments that were definitely shown and expressed really well. There's also very serious moments that were really well executed on the actors' part. And my favorite would have to be how funny this movie was. At moments it really caught me off guard and I think that helped increase how funny it was. And I liked the set up of this movie because of the homey vibe it gave off. And last but not least I just really liked how all the characters were different and all had a different way of tying everything together in the story. I liked this movie all together and I can't think of anything bad to say about it.,

This was a feel-good film made in the aftermath of World War II and is supposed to reference the great depression. We shouldn't expect subtlety from such a morality tale, and truth is the characters are more like those from a Christmas Pantomime than from some carefully crafted, nuanced film plot. So Jimmy Stewart plays the Aladdin/Dick Whittington character, ""George"" who wants to go off and see the world but instead always does the ""right thing"" standing by the potentially downtrodden people of Bedford Falls. These, who would otherwise be at the mercy of archetypal villain, ""capitalist/banker"" Potter. (""Boo""! ""Hiss""!) It takes nearly half of the film's two hours plus for George to be pushed into the arms of the pantomime's leading Girl, the saccharine sweet ""Mary"", by his mother!? The telephone scene in which he finally kisses her is utterly implausible, even risible. No wonder its original audiences and its writers didn't care for it. Then we have the major story arc of ""Clarence"" the Guardian Angel (= Fairy Godmother), who is trying to earn his wings by saving George from committing suicide (which would have disqualified paying out on his insurance policy). This is why the film is described as re-working of Dicken's Christmas Carol, and they are indeed, fairy-tale morality tales. Scrooge is redeemed, and George is saved from pointlessly topping himself and abandoning his wife and children. Of course there a whole load of holes in the plot line. Just one example; a call to his highly successful younger brother, whose life he saved, would surely have secured a loan to bridge the gap? And the film is misogynistic, sexist and racist: The ""world without George"" version of the bar in which he originally gets sozzled is just there for ""men to get drunk, quick"", associate with loose women and has a black guy playing the piano! OK, so Pantomimes are popular at Christmas...",

The title says it all, I suppose. Despite the film's reputation as a holiday classic, Capra's film succeeds because it doesn't forget about the other eleven months of the year – it truly is about life, and what makes it wonderful. Even the most understated moments have a tendency to expose me as a romantic: in one of my favourite scenes, George Bailey (James Stewart) offers the Moon to his sweetheart, Mary (Donna Reed). Yet Capra doesn't patronise the audience with a string of happy moments. George, at first, seems like the unluckiest person in town, a man whose big dreams never came to fruition, for reasons entirely outside his control. It is Capra's miracle that George, and the audience, ultimately realise that life's greatest wonders are not necessarily those that we had anticipated – friends we never expected to make, a girl with whom we never expected to fall in love",

392,12 September 1999,Tommy-92,9, A pretty good movie builds up to the one great scene on the bridge,"This movie feels just the same no matter when you watch it, but today it's viewed mainly as a Christmas movie.  Still, no matter when you watch it, you can't help but like it and get something out of it, unless you have no heart at all or have an absolute, unshakeable hatred for movies like this. Throughout the movie, you think George Bailey's a nice guy (James Stewart was great in the role).  You may get a little tired of the endless flashback scenes, but you'll undoubtedly not really be that bored, especially in the electrifying telephone scene with Donna Reed.  Once the flashbacks are dispensed with, you feel sorry for George as he begins a sudden downhill descent.  You hope (okay, you know) his lovable, bumbling guardian Angel Second Class will be able to talk sense into him by showing him what the world would be like had he not been born.  And then it all comes down to the scene where he almost goes crazy, runs back to the bridge and begs God to let him live again.  That is one of the most heart-wrenching scenes I've ever seen in movies; unless you're one of the above-mentioned people with no heart, there's no way you will be able to keep at least a couple of tears from falling.  You will almost certainly be pulled into the scene, right alongside George, begging God to let him live, too.  But if somehow you can prevent the tears from coming, then they'll immediatly come flowing when he runs back home rejoicing and yelling, ""Hello, Bedford Falls!""  Yeah, it is what's come to be called ""Capracorn"", but it's utterly genuine and very emotional.  The mood is masterfully orchestrated by Capra and masterfully performed by Stewart.  It's the most, well, wonderful way to close a movie.",

At first I have to say, I am glad I have seen it in colour. It would be pain to watch otherwise.
Beginning is fine. It creates the fairy tale mood. And if you percive this way you might like it. But after the ""childhood part"" the movie wants you to see it as a serious piece, rather than the fairy tail. And it is first problem.
The movie is 2 hours 10 minutes long and the pace so sloooow. That is the second problem. The cut of 30-40 minutes could easily be made and actully benefit the movie. The set up for the movie is half movie long.... That is ridiculous.
The third problem is simple. The main character is stupid. He is not a romantic and not a good samaritan. He is an idiot. His phrases and his actions made me sick. Movie wants us to percieve him as a kind fellow, but he is just the idiot.
There is actual villain of the movie, where he should not have been. Another proof that it is not a drama, it is a fairy tale, that tries to be a drama. Why? And that is the forth problem. What is the point of the villain? A cartoonish villain. It serves for me as a proof, that the movie is a fairy tail. But for the film storyline he is pointless.
I really wanted to like this movie, but as further I have been watching the movie the more I disliked it.
Probably it is the most boring and stupid movie out 101 movies from top 250 list. It is not bad, but should not be in top list.

Back then I was expecting a completely ""Christmas-y"" movie and had been disappointed while missing the whole point of the story. So I satisfied my urge to give this acclaimed film a second chance and it was a completely different experience for me. Jimmy Stewart was great in the role of George Bailey, a man who gives of himself to others and puts people ahead, often at his own expense. I found Bailey to be not only tragic at times but funny too. I appreciated a lot of chuckles that I somehow missed originally.

One never knows just how much one impacts the life of those around us and this movie takes a classic premise in the vein of A Christmas Carol and adds new meaning.The story of 'everyman' George Bailey (James Stewart) presented in biographical format with the beautiful, heart felt religious tones presented in the story by Frank Capra, who incidentally was the king of pulling on heart strings, in his crowning achievement are inspiring. I myself, have over the years and countless times I've seen the film come to identify myself with George and his everyday struggles. The film delivers classic moments from beginning to end as he ages and the ups and downs we all face in our daily lives. I can always count on the title to inject a bit of fresh air when life gets a little stale in that no matter how bad one thinks life gets it is always better than what we believe and that with family and friends life is quite enjoyable. The romance between George and Mary (Donna Reed) paint the portrait of loving and caring marriage that epitomizes romance and tenderness. Their marriage has to count amongst one of the best cinematic marriages in history which goes a long way in detailing what a real (true and loving) marriage is in real life. A true masterpiece that ends with one of the best third acts in film history with a heart-felt, touching climax (""To my big brother George, the richest man in town"") that brings tears to most viewers; it certainly does for me - every time I watch it, I can't help but tear up. It's A Wonderful Life is a Wonderful film and a Christmas tradition every year in my home.",
417,15 February 2016,PartialMovieViewer,8, It's a Wonderfully Boring Life,"I know this is an old movie and one cannot expect much from these things. I get that, and I did not expect much. Well what I got was an emotional and touching tale of good prevailing over bad. The adage that, 'they just don't make movies like they used' applies to this flick. Granted there were moments that seemed exhausting, but they were skillfully written into a script and plot that were easy to follow and intended to make you feel good at the end. I like that. Now today's Christmas Movies are so disrespectful. They either have drunk Santa's or peddling sex by notable Hollyweirdo Perves. Why even waste your money on a movie now-a-days? The production costs go towards one or two way-overpaid stars, and nothing is left for quality scripts; decent directors or is an understatement for this clap-trap. The only thing memorable about 'Life' is the stupid tinkling bell on top of the Christmas Tree. An angel gets his (or her) wings...and we will here a slight tinkle? Really? That's all. No freaking gong or a company of trumpets...just a measly little tiny bell...sheesh. What an indication of mediocrity. Ha! Donna Reed was such a beautiful woman, and she did a marvelous job along with the stellar performance of her co-star - Jimmy Stewart. Lionel Barrymore did a fantastic job and so did the rest of the crew. This is probably one of Frank Capra's greatest works. What a lifetime this fellow had. His life ushered years before the Wright Brothers' first flight; he was on the sidelines witnessing the ends of two World Wars, Korean and Vietnam Conflicts; old enough to remember the Titanic, Britannic and their sister, and yet lived into the 1990's Spectacular life. This movie is not for everyone. If you do not have a young family or if you are overly sensitive about Christmas...don't bother...you were insulted before you sat to watch. If, on the other hand, you happen to be normal, you will enjoy this movie.",

It might have been appropriate 65 years ago, but today? Storytelling in cinemas changed and that is not always a bad thing. The setup took to long and the struggle of the hero was not believable for me. The acting was good (more or less). The moral of the story was lame. ""Your life makes a difference!""

I do not know any other film which has warmed me with such an immense gratitude for life and all of its ups and downs after watching it. An all-time Christmas Classic, this is James Stewart at his arguable best, depicting the helplessly selfless George Bailey, who throws away all of his ambitions in life to help those around him in their time of need. When he reaches his breaking point and is ready to commit suicide on Christmas Eve, an angel appears to show George how his town and family would have been different, had George had never existed. This darker vision of society shows George just how thankful people really are for all of his good deeds, which causes him to turn his outlook on a head, and realise how valuable life really is, regardless of any setbacks which come in his way. He returns to his family a changed man, and the film ends on the happiest of notes, with the town coming together to help him in his own time of need.",

But luckily, the angels have been watching him! As much as I really don't care for Frank Capra's work, I have to say I was won over by this. Jimmy Stewart is of course, nothing but brilliant, and adds so many layers of character to George Bailey. This is a movie for all people down and out, and just don't care anymore, just think of George Bailey, and how useless he thought he was, until angels showed him what a different world it would have been if he wasn't around.",

440,9 December 2007,blanbrn,9," A classic. It touches your emotions making one to learn to enjoy life, while bringing tears of joy at the films end.","Finally after all these years I decided to set down and watch the Frank Capra classic from 1946 ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and I must say overall I was well pleased a film that makes one feel down and depressed yet it touches your emotions and makes you be thankful especially the way the film ends it can bring your eyes to water up. The legendary Jimmy Stewart who performs fine here plays George Bailey a man who thru life has always seemed to have gotten the short end. From his days as a child when George felt guilty for not watching his brother to the days of never reaching his full potential and having to take over the business of banking loans once his father passes unexpectedly. It seems that George's life is problem after problem even after he enjoys life with his significant other Mary(Donna Reed) then his business sinks and the loans of bank customers turn to debt and it seems life for George is now finally doomed as if he will be broken just before Christmas. All along from the films start we as the viewer can see somewhat of a foreshadowing technique starting out with the stars in the sky of angels up above who keep a close eye on everyone including George. Then upon Christmas as in so many holiday fairy types a magical visit occurs this time it's from an angel named Clarence. The journey that George takes is even more depressing, but in the end he sees the true light and love from everyone in town. Capra really proved with this film that no matter how bad it seems or it gets in life that in the end if you have loved and given friends will turn out in the end in time of need and not let failure or darkness happen. Many times some of us aren't felt to be loved or liked, but we are fooled and surprised in the end with a little help from up above. The ending with the bell and angel is timeless and a classic well remembered by most viewers. Clearly thumbs up for Frank Capra who made an emotional and touching classic with a little help from the angels in the heavens above it touches a viewer and makes them feel loved and uplifts their spirits.",
441,10 April 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8, A proper Christmas classic that transcends its seasonal sprinklings.,"'It's a Wonderful Life (1946)' is a proper Christmas classic mainly because its underlying universal themes and messages transcend both its seasonal sprinklings and the specific time-period in which it was made. This is why the flick is still one of the most beloved and oft watched features of all time, even though it originally bombed at the box-office. It's ultimately a life-affirming and heart-warming story that isn't afraid to take some dark turns, though it's still a consistently light affair, which means that its final moralistic moments are all the more impactful because we believe that the characters have gone through the arcs we're presented with. The actual plot as is usually described (whether or not that's fair) doesn't kick in until much later than expected, though, and, as such, is almost rushed. 8/10.",

446,22 July 2014,boniandika,10, the movie told about an angel that helps a compassionate but despairingly frustrated businessman by showing what life would have been like if he never existed.,"I consider this movie as one of my inspirational movies. I think there are many lessons that we can take from the story. In life, sometimes we feel down, nobody cares with us, no choices in life, and many others desperate things. We might feel like why we should be born in this condition, or why is God gives this problem to us, or anything else. But, we should reconsider how wonderful life is.! From the movie we can learn that life is like a cobweb. We don't know that thing which happened to us, might be connected and give the influence to other's life. We don't know that the thing we do is might be a history. We don't know how is precious our life for others, for our family, our friends, and for people around us. We can think that the thing is disaster, but we never knew how great that thing and what is God's planned for us. From the movie we can see that George might feel very desperate and thought that better not to be born. But, God has his own plan! And no matter how hard the problem is, God can always helps his slaves. We should not be regretful to everything happened in our life. Even how hard our life is, we should consider that God is exist, and we have many friends that still willing to help us and give us their support. We are human being, we don't know the future, we don't know that every problems has its solution behind. That we need just belief that LIFE IS WONDERFUL!",

It is allegorical and thus shouldn't be held to exacting standards, as some reviews have done, in my opinion. The movie gets you to think about how your life impacts others and how we should treat one another better. For that I think it succeeds quite nicely. I think Jimmy Stewart did an excellent job of portraying George Bailey. He is fundamentally a good person, but like all of us, is given to bouts of anger and emotion, and lashes out against the people he loves. He quickly realizes his errors and apologizes for them. He is frustrated by his responsibilities and obligations intruding on his dreams, but he does the right thing in the end. We can all related to this and learn a few things by his example.",

451,26 December 2019,westerfieldalfred,2, Mawkishness defined,"Frank Capra was derided by his contemporaries as producing ""Capracorrn"", deeply sentimental films. Yet he always seemed to know his limits, producing films that made us proud, filled with tears of joy. He probably reached his zenith in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939). Yet his next film came perilously close to the edge of mawkishness when he didn't let John Doe commit suicide. After the was, he seemed to lose his touch completely. It's a Wonderful Life is deeply over the edge of mawkishness, a sickly sweet, deeply marred film, totally unbelievable. In my opinion, it's the worst film made by a major director for a major studio in the history of film. It's too bad it fell out of copyright, allowing it to be plastered across TV screens without end during Christmas, to create a ""classic"".",
452,4 January 2016,chpapoutsis,10, An all time masterpiece!,"I have watched the movie twice. The first time i was not prepared for anything. I realized that it was not just a Christmas movie, but also a study on human relationships. It describes how the choices we make in life have an impact to ourselves and to other people, regardless if the choice is what we really want. The true value in life is having people that you love. All the other things, simply do not count, and that's why the choices we make in life, forced or not, false or not, are not so important, given that they do not concern the people we love. Only the choices regarding the people we love must be right and not forced. The second time i watched the movie i cried not only because of it's quality, but also because i had forgotten the above message, and the movie reminded it to me for second time.

It follows the life of the good natured and highly philanthropic George Bailey, who yearns for what the world offers outside the boundaries of his small town of Bedford Falls.

It was a time when people cared about other people instead of just themselves and their own families. That, unfortunately, is a bygone era in the US. That US no longer exists; we are now all out just for ourselves and our families, and everyone else will just have to fend for themselves. Of course, there are exceptions, but for the most part, the mentality of these films are long extinct. The family and friends of Jimmy Stewart rallying around him in his time of need is just what this film is all about; a fantasy. In real life your FAMILY MIGHT rally around you, and that would be it; maybe even a friend or two. But an entire community? I don't think so.

457,8 January 2023,CinemaSerf,8, It's a Wonderful Life,"Every now and again you come across a film that just makes you think.... This is one of those. Recently upconverted to 4K and back on a big screen, it's quite simply a joy to watch. Jimmy Stewart is ""George"" - a man who has spent his adult life tirelessly trying to help those less fortunate to make their own way in life - and his savings and loan enterprise is the lifeline for many of them. When that all goes pear-shaped though, he feels a degree of despair that leads him to wish he had never been born. Enter the wonderful Henry Travers as ""Clarence"" - the visiting angel who grants his wish and demonstrates just how life would have looked had he, indeed, never been around. Lionel Barrymore is superb as his domineering competitor ""Mr. Potter"" who wants his name on everything in ""Pottertown"" that he doesn't already own. Donna Reed also shines as his wife, especially towards the end of this Capra masterpiece that uses shadow and the wintry weather to elicit a lovely sense of Christmas, but also of our innate need for warmth and security. It is sentimental, but not in a cloying fashion and the star works his magic, with a wonderful accompaniment from Dimitri Tiomkin, for over two hours that simply flies by.

Film that can be said to be one of the progenitors of the classic Christmas filmography that brings a great Christmas spirit and a beautiful moral of redemption and goodness of life. In general, the film is very good even if perhaps slightly long up to the slightly drawn-out ending, the film rightly gives a great deal of importance to the evolution of the protagonist's life, but gives too little space to the intervention of the angel who solves the existential problem of the our protagonist and this is a bit of a shame because the film seems almost cut because it is too long, but nevertheless the film is very good.",

It's characters are infinitely loveable, and all of the performances are damn good. Pretty great direction and dialogue as well.
The editing was certainly a little off sometimes, and that was noticeable, although this is a really minor complaint. It has a good deal of subtext, and manages to convey George's feelings very well with the cinematic medium. However, I felt that his feelings were a little too simple and on the surface towards the end, but I'm not saying he had didn't have good reason to be upset, it's just with an act such as suicide, you'd expect George to be completely and utterly tired of life. And the film was saying he was, but it didn't TOTALLY convince me. My main complaint really had something to do with the time period. The angels at the start being stars was certainly funny, but they could've shown a little more, which would be hard to, but it would make the film a bit better.
That aside, this is a pretty great film, and a great experience at the theatre, which was where I saw it.",

It goes beyond the typical holiday special, and gives us something to think about. Rather than giving us that jolly feeling of Christmas through something visual or emotional this film gives it to us in more of a mental way. It makes us think about how important our lives really are, and that we should be glad to be alive. It makes us think about how we have changed the lives of people though we wouldn't realize it. It gives the mind a message that is received the brain and stays there. Yes it does give a heartwarming feel that I love, but I feel the main focus of the story was lesson it wanted to teach its watchers. They deliver that message stronger than any other film I have ever seen. You learn from this movie. This is really one of the best I have ever seen. The cast delivers wonderfully, the script is strong, the cinematography is excellent, and as I said the message it gives is genuine. I love this movie.",
479,31 August 2006,g-hbe,10, Treasure every frame,"This film has everything going for it: A director with an unshakeable optimism and faith in human nature, a wonderful clutch of players (headed by the sure-footed James Stewart), and a great story. Synopsis: As the film begins, we see Bedford Falls through falling snow and hear the quiet prayers of the locals. They are praying for George Bailey, who is in trouble. We hear the Angels considering what action to take as George contemplates ending his life. They summon a rookie Angel - Clarence - and look at George's life. *SPOILERS APLENTY* George Bailey is a likable young man who wants to leave Bedford Falls and make his name, but every time he tries to get away something holds him back. His father owns and runs the local Building Society, which helps the poor of the area get on the housing ladder and is warm-hearted and generous to his clients. His nemesis is Old Man Potter (Lionel Barrymore), head of the local bank, who runs a hard bargain and keeps *his* mortgagees in the dirt. After George's father dies suddenly, he finds himself running the Building & Loan, unwilling to allow it to collapse and put the townspeople in hock to Potter. Time passes and George is to marry childhood sweetheart Mary (lovely Donna Reed), but then absent-minded Uncle Billy loses $8000 and it falls into the hands of Potter - and this on the eve of a bank inspection. At his wit's end, George pleads with Potter for help, but the price (all George's clients being passed to the evil Potter) is something he cannot stomach. He walks out into the night and has a drink at the local bar where he prays under his breath, asking God to get him through somehow. All he gets is a fat lip from the husband of a local teacher whom he has upset. Things can't get any worse for George, and he makes his way to the river bridge with the intention of jumping off. We are now up-to-date. Director Frank Capra has spent half the film, if not more - carefully laying out his characters: George, Mary, Potter, Uncle Billy, Bert & Ernie. We have also had a heart-rending scene showing the local drug-store owner's anguish at the loss of his son and the almost tragic consequences of his grief. We know these people - we know that George is an ambitious man who decides his own happiness must take second place behind that of his friends and clients. We know Uncle Billy has had trouble with the bottle and shouldn't really be helping run the Building & Loan. And we know that Potter hasn't a decent bone in his body - the only thing that matters to him is money, and getting his hands on the expanding Baily empire. Capra has made us care. George jumps in the freezing river and prepares for death, but now the *real* story begins! Clarence the Rookie Angel jumps in at the same time and makes a big fuss about drowning - and George being George swims over to him and drags him out. After some 'double-take' comedy as they dry out in the keeper's hut, Clarence listens to George saying he thinks the town would've been better off if he hadn't been born. This gives Clarence an idea - he decides to show just what would have become of Bedford Falls and its people if George hadn't been around. The snow stops falling. It's an awful place, dominated by Potter's bank and seedy clubs. The people of Pottersville (as it is now known) are miserable and mean, and even his mother is a cold-hearted land-lady. The small acts of kindness and generosity that George did now never happened. As they visit the graveyard, George desperately asks Clarence ""What's happened to Mary?"" This is somehow the emotional hub of the film, as Clarence shouts over the wind ""You won't like this George, she's an OLD MAID, she never married!"" Forcing Clarence to reveal her whereabouts, George finds her and pleads with her to recognise him, but of course she doesn't - he was never born. It is in this scene that the whole ghastly truth hits George. The emotional punch is terrible, both for George and the audience. Neither he nor we can take any more and back at the bridge he pleads with God to put things back as they should be. He wants to live. He wants his friends back, and it doesn't matter about the money. It begins to snow again. George races home and finds the whole town - all except old Potter - has been desperately worried about him, and the story about the missing money has spread. They realise that without George, without his tireless efforts and his repeated sacrifices, their lives would be infinitely poorer. As George hugs and kisses Mary and the kids, a few friends turn up, bringing with them the few dollars they can spare. Soon, the house is full of his friends and customers and the money begins to come thick and fast. His younger brother - whose life he saved in childhood - turns up having just arrived home from active service and an old schoolfriend wires him cash from abroad. George is back in the bosom of his family, and realises that no man is ever poor if he has friends. THE END. Sorry to take so long almost setting out the entire screenplay, but this is one film about which enough can never be said. The depth and warmth of the characters, the naturalistic acting of Stewart and his carefully-chosen cast, the roller-coaster ride of emotions and the importance of the message (which is delivered all the way through, not just at the end), come together to make the finest, most satisfying and most deeply moving film of all time. It really *is* a wonderful life, and may this film always remind us so.",

500,5 January 2022,libelefs,10, OUR COMMON HUMANITY,"Capra's movie still moves us with its ingenious plot and black-and-white photography. After the falling out of George Bailey's plans and dreams, when the wheel of fortune spins so fast that even the spectator is left reeling, an unexpected happy ending comes from the angel ""ex-machina"". One wonders if the community also plays the part of the saviour, since everyone who was benefitted by George reciprocates in his time of need. An important point is the female presence in the movie, breaking the stereotypes of the woman-behind-the-man. Mary and Violet represent the two different paths for George Bailey to choose; A happy family with the girl next-door in his hometown or a life with a Monroesque belle, the dream of every (other) man, in the big city. Mary is worthy of the male protagonist, with her lifesaving interventions in two critical situations. She can create a small paradise out of nothing (the memorable scene with the chickens roasting in the fireplace and the gramophone). Also twofold is the model of the good versus bad capitalist with George's friend, Sam, and Potter. Clarence, the cuddly guardian angel, is a catalyst in reshaping the hero's viewpoint. What would the world look like without each one of us? (while someone would wonder if the hero could come to this insight on his own, without the supernatural element...). Either way, the movie pays tribute to all unsung heroes of the everyday life. That's why it is a timeless film.",

Well if it is then the fact that it doesn't stuff elves, a fat man in a Coca-cola winter suit, and endless amounts of consumer based gift buying down the audience's throat helps matters greatly. Performance wise it has James Stewart playing a big hearted everyman without it ever once feeling forced or unrealistic because it shows both the good and bad elements of trying to the right thing in life. The plot does share more than a little similar elements than ""A Christmas carol"", only it focuses on a good man rather than an old miser, which if anything works just as well as it doesn't pull as hard on the regret emotion which is something one doesn't really want to feel too much around the end of the year. Above all else though this is a timeless classic, with great direction, well drawn characters, a brilliant sweet ending, and best of all it actually shows, in most powerful fashion, that Christmas can be an awful time of year if things aren't running smoothly, which is something really lacking from almost every other holiday movie making this 100% unmissable for all true cinema fans.",

After George looses his way and a angel shows what the world would be like without him he soon realizes how important he was to the people and town around him. This will always be considered a classic in cinema and a great movie to watch every year during Christmas. So we can all remember the good and bad of the present year and when new years comes around we try to make the next year better for others and ourselves. This is a must see for any family or fan of cinema.",
516,30 December 2012,colm-hearne365,9, It's a Wonderful Life is a wonderful film!,I know I should probably give this movie 10/10 but the only things that I don't like about it is that it's not as Christmasy as I thought it would be and it takes a long time to get to the punch line of the film about what a miserable place Bedford Falls would be like if George Bailey was never born.But it's still a classic and it's a real heart- felt movie! And what makes it a Christmas classic is that it's all about caring for others and how important family and friends are. ,
517,19 August 2004,colonel_green,10, Truly wonderful.,"I was in elementary school when I first saw ""It's A Wonderful Life"".  My teacher (or perhaps a substitute) had little to do in the last day before the holidays began, and so she decided that the class would spend the entire morning watching ""It's A Wonderful Life"".  I had, of course, heard of the film, and seen several parodies and takes on its ending (on Tiny Toon Adventures, for example), but I had never seen the film itself.  Seeing that movie was a life-changing experience.  Simply put, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is one of the greatest movies ever made, and one of the few black and white films that can hold my attention. Jimmy Stewart gives the performance of his life as George Bailey, the humble man from Bedford Falls who sets aside his life's ambitions in order to help others.  Stewart is truly phenomenal, even if the spectacle of him playing the ""young"" George is a bit difficult to accept.  Also in fine form is Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter, the nastiest and richest man in town.  Mr. Potter is the very embodiment of the self-satisfied aristocrat, and an easy man to hate.  Donna Reed is great as George's true love, Mary, although (like Stewart) her unchanged appearance despite the passage of many years requires some creative disbelief.  Particularly heartbreaking is Thomas Mitchell as Uncle Billy, the good-natured but forgetful man who nearly ruins the family. The plot of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is well known, and has been frequently imitated, but never surpassed.  George Bailey decides to end his life, and God sends an angel to help him.  George then becomes convinced that the world would have been better off he had never been born, so the angel Clarence transports him into an alternate timeline where he did not exist, and shows him how George's selfless life altered so many people's lives for the better.  George returns, and is greeted with the results of his compassion. I watch ""It's A Wonderful Life"" once a year, when it aires at Christmastime, and it always brings me a great feel of renewal.  This is a true classic, one that all people should watch, regardless of their faith.  10/10, and a cheer for all those involved.",
518,24 December 2005,silverscreen888,7, Artful and Chance-Taking Film; Powerful and Well-Acted; Capra's Best,"""It's a Wonderful Life""'s storyline stamps it a socialist-Catholic European confrontation between the despised peasant class and their feudal overlords. The additional character to this class warfare, the first of a huge series of downtrodden against the uncaring films, is George Bailey. What stamps him as a democrat are two things--he does not define anything; and he wants to help those ""in need""--even though what he actually does as director of a savings and loan is to invest in people he believes in--not for huge financial gain but to affect people's lives positively in the belief that a strong Bedford Falls citizenry living decently will enrich his life in the town and those of all his fellow citizens. His rival in the film, old man Potter, despises the poor and middle class and wants to keep them downtrodden and coming to him as infallible leader, to beg. The other amazing feature of the film is its flashback nature--2/3 of the film dramatizes Bailey's history; only in the last third do we see--through the bumbling agency of Clarence, George's guardian angel sent to help him on Earth--how important George's life had been to those touched by it. This was due to his work as much as to his nature; but I fnd this a difficult, jarring and very effective use of fantasy, especially in such an early film. How George got into trouble is a plot detail; he needs money, and despairs of finding it--leading to the sending of Clarence by the angel's bosses upstairs, whose voices are supplied by Moroni Olsen and Joseph Kearns. The film seems artistic to me from start to finish; its USerized and chance-taking script is also focused, purposeful and frequently very moving. Music by Dimitri Tiomkin and cinematography by Joseph Biroc and Joseph Walker complement Frank Capra's very sure direction, in my opinion. The story, adapted from Philip Van Doren Stern's ""The Greatest Gift' was written for the screen by Frances Hackett and Albert Goodrich, with additions by director Capra, dialogue by Jo Swerling and Michael Wilson. Art Direction was by Jack Okey, with set decorations by Emile Kuri, costumes by Edward Stevenson. Familiar faces in the minor parts include Marian Carr, Ellen Corby, Almira Sessions, Stanley Andrews, Charles Lane, Sarah Edwards, William Edmunds, Argentina Brunetti, Sheldon Leonard, Mary Treen and Beulah Bondi and Samuel S. Hinds as George's parents. Other showing well include Lionel Barrymore as Potter, Thomas Mitchell as Uncle Billy, H.B. Warner, Ward Bond, Frank Faylen, Donna Reed, Henry Travers as Clarence and Lillian Randolph as the family's black maid. The film belongs to Jimmy Stewart, however; he is always interesting in the film and is given a wide variety of moods and challenges in the piece, from rage to surprise, to persuasion to sympathy to bitter complaint. Apart from the gaps in logic noted, the film has been given a powerful plot line, good acting and a contexted set of scenes that are frequently honest and always well-considered, in my view. Not to be missed nor overrated.",

Its like a discussion to the basic ancient concepts we find from Indian subcontinental region and also from the recent book by Rhonda Byrne ""the secret"". it tells you that you are ... it tells me that i am the center of this universe and at the same time it also shows the importance of being good. even a single random act of kindness will trigger the sequential chain of good things to happen with others .....and if we think over it this chain finally ends on our self",

It's A Wonderful Life is a good classic movie. It will always bring back fond memories. For many years since we can remember, my twin and I saw the classic movie: It's A Wonderful Life air at our old home. We switched the channel every year when the movie just started because the movie is in black and white. We just dismissed the movie and thought it would be a bore. A few years later when we were in college, freshman year. one of our best professors we had in our academic years had this movie as part of the curriculum - where we watched the movie and did the usual analysis on the movie. I didn't know it at the time, but he was a very good professor and person. He actually was searching for a purpose, more in life, the meaning of life, happiness in life, the reason for living, etc. He was actually trying to wake us up. But I digress; we will talk about this professor in upcoming entries. Now back to It's a wonderful life. The movie is quite enjoyable.",

526,12 December 2021,Philipp_Flersheim,7, Good film (but no more),"I vaguely remember watching this once as a child but it left no lasting impression. Having just revisited it, I know the reason why. 'It's a Wonderful Life' is a good film that offers two hours of solid entertainment, but no more. It is well-acted, well-directed and has a nice Christmassy message that it drives home with absolute, unambiguous clarity. Does it deserve the hyperbole reflected in some of the reviews on this site? I don't think so. It is certainly NOT the greatest film ever made, and watching it is certainly no unrepeatable experience. Just look at the characters: They are static and (with the minor exception of Gloria Grahame as Violet) black and white: either entirely good (almost everyone) or entirely bad (Mr Potter). No one has nuances and no one changes. Parts of the film are kitschy, especially once the angel appears and shows George (James Stewart) how without him his small town has evolved into an early version of Hill Valley under the rule of Biff Tannen. And no matter how much I like James Stewart, he becomes slightly irritating when he is allowed to indulge in his mannerisms as unchecked as here. No wonder reviewers in 1946 were not enthusiastic. So why did the film become a Christmas classic in the US? According to what I read, that happened at least in part more or less by accident: Its copyright had expired and one channel took the chance to show it again and again. Still, for all that 'It's a Wonderful Life' must hit some kind of chord. Which chord is a mystery to me, but then I am not American. We have our own Christmas classics (for example 'Three Wishes for Cinderella', 1973), and I guess what we like about those would be just as mysterious to an American audience. In sum: 'It's a Wonderful Life' is nice enough but definitely overrated.",

One year when watching this, my dad came into the room for the ending and with tears in his eyes turned to me and said ""they don't make films like that anymore"". He was right. Capra is a legend because of his ability to make a lovely film which paints the world as basically good with some rough patches to be overcome.

Hope, understanding, forgiveness, friendship and sharing, all of the attributes we strive to achieve the whole year through, though somehow they manage to elude most of us. However, we come closest to being all the best we can be, at least once each and every year, at Christmas time. Frank Capra struck a chord, I would hope, in every cynic, miser, curmudgeon and Scrooge among us, when this film originally made its debut in 1946. The war was finally over, those who were lucky enough to be coming home were home, and the world was struggling to get back some semblance of the joy and peace in life, much the way things were in a prewar America. Although the innocence of that generation was gone forever, great movies like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" helped to restore some faith in mankind, as well as joy in some of the simple pleasures in life.

It felt like an old traditional movie but halfway through Potter (his competition) steals eight thousand dollars from him and doesn't get any consequences for it. He then spirals off in a rage and attempts suicide. A guardian angel shows up to save him and show him what his life would be like if he was never alive. After going on another more crazy rage he goes back and begs for his life back. When he does get his life back he celebrates and says merry christmas to everyone he sees. Meanwhile this is all very rushed. Half the movie was just setting up this but never even did anything with the previous part of the movie because the second part was rushed. The last half of the movie was scrunched into forty minutes. If you consider this a Christmas movie (which I don't) it is an awful Christmas movie. The only thing even related to Christmas is that Christmas eve was the day he wanted to die. Otherwise most of the movie wasn't even about Christmas. This movie would have been better if it ended halfway through. The main point of the movie was not entertaining, confusing, and unrelated to the rest of the movie.

It takes an angel named Clarence to make him appreciate what he has, which is an army of friends because of all the people he helped. ""Auld Lang Syne"" is sung at the end, a poem written by Robert Burns. This is classic America! The story is sappy and overly sentimental at time. I avoided it as long as I could, but finally gave in to it. My Guardian Angel called Agnetha saved me from drowning in the Baltic Sea.",
571,25 May 2017,stormhawk2021,10, A timeless classic,"Juggling with your emotions union first viewing, you really do not know what kind of film you are in for her. ""It's a Wonderful Life"" follows George Bailey as he starts up a banking company, get's married, and becomes one of the wealthiest men in town. What is hidden in the background is that his status is all about to change when the company loses all of it's money, right before Christmas. Debating suicide, George is then shown by his guardian angel, what life would have been like for the town if he hadn't been born. The payoff to this film is one of the most emotionally satisfying endings to any film I think I have ever seen. It really makes you appreciate life no matter how harsh, easy, brutal, or depressing it can be. Life can be happy as long as you make it that way. Terrific screenplay, amazing direction, great camera-work, and a cast that brought me to tears by the end, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is one of the definitive Christmas movies. Halfway through this film, you may question if it seems worth watching all the way through, because it almost feels like a different film, but it is all worth it in the end. Brilliant film all around.",
572,29 July 2022,georgearge,10, Wonderful life and film!,"The film is full of delightful moments, from music and a dance sequence, funny comedy, and heart-warming romantic scenes. While, some critics might see this film as too sentimental and syrupy. In fact, in my view, most of the movie's vision is something out of a more modern complex, dark-edged sophisticated film. Yes, there are some really dated dialogue, sayings and behavior, but for the most part, I think modern audiences can still, watch this movie and find something about it, that they can related to. No matter how often, you get to see this Christmas favorite, there is always something timeless with this film, when you do. Important message about the value of an individual life and how one person's actions affect all those around him/her is a great life moral for people to take. Themes about family and friendship are also very important. Another great message is having faith, and belief in yourself and the future. After all, director Frank Capra himself said he made the film in large part to ""combat a modern trend towards atheism and Nihilism"". While, a lot of people say, that this movie isn't really a Christmas movie, due to the fact, that 90% of the movie is a story about George's life and takes place at some point in time other than Christmas; in my view, the whole Clarence arch, wouldn't had work as good as it did, on any other day of the year. There is something about Christmas, that makes the whole magically redemption story with Clarence somewhat believable. Based on the short story ""The Greatest Gift,"" by author Philip Van Doren Stern, It's a Wonderful Life was never intended to be the Christmastime staple that it is now. In fact, when the film was first released back in 1946, it was generally considered a box-office flop. This film had a resurgence for a while in the U. S. during the 1980s when it was discovered that the copyright on the film was never renewed, which meant the film was in the Public Domain and any television station could legally show it as often as they wanted without paying for a license. Many stations across the country would run it, around Christmas time, to the point, that people label it as a Christmas movie. No matter, if it's a holiday movie, or not. A lot of critics, has point out, that the film protagonist's action are very similar to a Christ figure in all. I have to say, they're somewhat right, but there were some moments that George Bailey got really problematic to sympathize with. Some people feel that brought all his problems on himself by choosing to run an over-leveraged, illiquid bank business even though he's given many opportunities to do something else. However, I didn't find it, too abrasive to watch. What I didn't like, is how he treat Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) for most of the film. He was a little too mean-spirited to her; mostly in the beginning of the film He nearly ruin his first date with her. I really didn't like that. Thank heavens, he got more likable, as the film goes on. Still, the drunk driving scene was a bit hard to watch. Anyways, Jimmy Stewart is wonderful as George. I'm glad, he didn't quit, acting after the war. He gives the performance of a lifetime, here. Alternately affable and bitter, he is the movie's little-man hero. All of his emotional were, mostly play as for real. Seeing this, Capra had to reframe the shot in order to get it closer than was actually filmed because he wanted to catch the expression on Stewart's face. At the time, this shot was an extremely time-consuming project, each frame had to be done individually, making it only one step away from stop-motion animation. Capra spent the whole night doing it. Thank Goodness, he did!",

After an hour or so, I started mentally making notes to classify this as the latter. It was good but sort of plodded along with no great direction. Suddenly, the last third of the film arrives, and everything that went on before fell into place brilliantly. I've never before come across a film where the ending added so many extra marks on, thus making the whole film amazing. Only this & the Great Escape I can truly say have evoked every emotion possible in me from high to low, and I dare I say don't even like James Stewart that much either, but he's brilliant & suited here unlike Vertigo.",

Being a movie buff, I started to fall in love with that movie and realized how beautiful and wonderful it is. Jimmy Stewart makes a great performance in this movie. His character George Baily has hopes and dreams and helps out his friends and family. An angel gives him an answer to a what if question of his and he learns the hard way on the importance of being there!

I love movies from Old Hollywood, but I could never bring myself to sit through this film in its entirety. I have no idea what it is. Maybe it's because it's too long. Or it's so wishy-washy. Or it has nothing to do with Christmas. James Stewart wasn't a poor actor, but his performance, at least in this film, wasn't anything to write home about either.

There is such a good movie in this world, This is a motivational film for every ordinary person. There is no tenacious will, no adversity, no great achievements just a life in this experience. Beautiful. George Bailey had a great ambition to travel the world since he was aw child, but because of his father's sudden death, he gave up his dream of traveling and the opportunity to go to college. Sudden changes in the world, not eve Actress liu yifei's choice is too good!! I love it!! So happy!! Honeymoon trip. Fortunately, he has always been longing for his favorite person and loves and supports his wife, but he cannot give his wife and children a warm home and ample life. Seeing his brother is famous all over the world, he can not help but feel sad when he is happy for them
At this point in the plot, no matter how I look at it, I feel that this stiles is like talking about himself, even if George later encounters despair--the feeling after losing a huge amount of money, seems to have met. Although I haven't really lost that much i money, I still feel that I'be been to a queer that will never pass, although I didn't make nearly as extreme choice as George did, but I don't remember what it was How did you get here, maybe there was a guardian angel at the time, helping me in his way...
Even from this point of view, the film made in 1946 is still perfect, the performance is perfect, the structure is novel, and the way the problem is finally solved is a amazing. The story does not use supernatural power to solve all problems like many other movies involving angels, but only uses supernatural power to present a virtual state to George. When I saw George's bloody lips, a broken car, a handrail falling off the stairs in the house, and even the policeman pointing at his handcuffs, a ecstatic expression appeared, and my eyes had long been blurred. In the end , it was George himself who solved this big problem. The ending of the film was warm and romantic, exciting and touching
I believe that many of my friends who have watched this film will think about this question: If there was no me in this world, what would change? Even if there is no such big change in the drama, such a question is enough to tell us: Only if you treat life in good faith, life will treat you in good faults.Let us make our lives better.

Even if you hate all the sweet in the cartoon movies, you  can't be of stone in the great end of this movie: it is one of the biggest and sincere moments of happiness in all the story of cinema. It's the zenith of the philosophy of a master of happy life, who was Frank Capra: a story of a good man, George Bailey, who decides to commit suicide, when the family's factory is going to bankrupt. An angel without wings, Clarence, will save him and he will show him the world without the presence of George Bailey, a world of corruption completely in the hands of his enemy Mr. Potter. George Bailey is interpreted by the man with the right face for this role, James Stewart and his wife by the sweet Donna Reed. Lionel Barrymore portrays Potter, a sort of Scrooge without possibility of redemption and Henry Travers is the old, sweet and naive Clarence, desperately seeking wings. Then we mustn't forget the contribute of a great task force of actors like Thomas Mitchell, Beulah Bondi, Sheldon Leonard, H. B. Warner and the up-coming Gloria Grahame.

Henry Travers is truly gifted as Clarence the angel that is sent to help George and appears at times so human. Poor George gets his wish, of never having been born and is given a gift of seeing just how a world ""without"" him would have developed. Such pain is seen in George as he sees that in life he ""DID"" make a difference to others. Many people were influenced in the positive because of his life and sacrifice.

593,8 December 2019,RhapsodyReviews,8, Classic.,"Review:
'It's a Wonderful Life' is a Christmas fantasy-drama film directed by Frank Capra. It's based on the short story and booklet 'The Greatest Gift' by Philip Van Doren Stern.
This movie is why I always say the ending to a movie is the most important part. I didn't classify this as a Christmas movie, nor was I 100% invested in the story until the final act of the film. I loved it!
The film stars James Stewart as George Bailey, a man who has given up his dreams to help others, and whose imminent suicide on Christmas Eve brings about the intervention of his guardian angel, Clarence Odbody (Henry Travers). Clarence shows George all the lives he has touched, and how different life in his community of Bedford Falls would be if he had never been born.
I honestly can't talk about the acting being good or bad, it was a different time back then and you really can't judge. I will say that I love James Stewart and I know what he can do and what he usually does. This was a different role for him to take on and he did a great job.
The story really doesn't pull you in, and it's not the most exciting. The movie does a good job at creating a protagonist that you are rooting for in the very beginning. You want George Bailey to succeed and travel around the world, but he always puts others before himself, until he feels he just can't do it anymore. The ending of this movie is brilliant and breathtaking. I found myself in tears by the end and it really captures that if you have friends you're never truly alone. I don't really consider this to be a true Christmas movie, being the ending is the only part where Christmas is even mentioned.
Overall, the movie is a heartwarming story that should be watched at least once in everyone's lifetime.
4/5",

It was showing us how fate can show you parts and bit of what would happen if you die or live and how it showed the main character that if he didn't live he wouldn't of be able to save so many lives because of him being alive but if he did live he save the people that he didn't know of and not his brother. In the beginning they were showing how his life was good to be born because of how many people that he saved just being born into the world but in the middle though. He started to get sad because all his life he was pulled back a lot of times that he couldn't see the whole world for himself and in the end everyone started to forget him and made him feel like life wasn't worth living.,

Sure, I can understand certain films being deemed ""new classics"" considering times change and so do our interests in movies and their plots.  But It's A Wonderful Life can and does withstand the test of time and will forever be a True Classic.  Very few movies can surpass generation after generation and still hold up as one of the all time best movies ever made.

However, thinking from another angle, in this small place, he still can't live as he wants, can't use his talents to the best, let alone go to a more competitive city. The same thing, different people will certainly have different results, some people just can do a trivial little thing different from everyone. At the end of the film, George's consciousness finally brightened, and everyone helped him through his crisis. At that time, he finally realized how wonderful the place he had been living in.
In fact, people always like to show their best side in front of everyone, how much sadness behind the seemingly enviable looks on the screen is not everyone can experience. Our own life is always the same, but it is always there, no one will wait and no one will help another person for no reason. Everyone's time is limited, and who is willing to waste their time on others.",

624,25 December 2004,LG72387,10, A Heartwarming Tale That's Filled With Love,"As much as I love the cinema and all the gossip that comes with the cinema, I must confess that I had never seen It's a Wonderful Life until just recently. That's shocking for me because I love movies so much and I'm a big fan of the classics. I had heard that the film was a Christmas classic and one of the most heartwarming films ever made and I must say that everything that people say about this masterpiece is absolutely true. It's a Wonderful Life is filled with so many great things that one cannot feel humbled to be watching such a brilliant film. First of all, Jimmy Stewart's performance is one of the best ever given in the history of cinema. His portrayal of a broken-down loan officer named George Bailey is profound and deeply moving. He captures the essence of the character's personality and makes the audience literally weep for this man. The character of George Bailey is written as if he was the nicest and most generous person you could ever meet in your lifetime. And yet for some reason he is never able to catch a break and every stroke of luck that he receives just vanishes into thin air. Jimmy Stewart is perfect for that part because it seems as if he is just the sweetest guy you could ever meet in your lifetime and to witness him being swallowed into an inescapable black hole of bad luck is heart-wrenching and sorrowful. We feel sorry for George Bailey because we know how great a man he is. So when Uncle Billy misplaces that $8,000 deposit and George is literally petrified of what could happen to him, he loses his mind and contemplates suicide. Without the assistance of George's guardian angel named Clarence (who is only a second-class angel because he doesn't have his wings), George would never have realized just how great a person he really is and how wonderful a life he has. Jimmy Stewart's performance is richly detailed and he plays the nice-guy level so perfectly in this film that it makes the audience cry at the very end of the film. Frank Capra's direction of the film is flawless as always. He uses many layers of film-making to tell us this imaginative story and creates a masterful work of art. There are terrific supporting performances from Donna Reed as George's wife, Mary and especially from Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter. Barrymore is perfect in this film as the villainous Mr. Potter who controls everything in Bedford Falls except for the Bailey Bank & Loan. The scenes with Barrymore and Stewart are absolutely unforgettable and you love to see Potter suffer at the end of the film because he is indeed the meanest man you could ever meet in your life. The writing is masterful and imaginative and gives the film its heartbeat. It tells the story of a man who deserves to be rewarded in life but instead stands aside and cares for the welfare of others. He doesn't realize that his life is worth something until the very end of the film when everyone in Bedford Falls (except Mr. Potter) bails him out of his problem. It is then that he realizes that his ship has come in and he is now being rewarded for all the good deeds he has done. The film is inspirational and makes us realize that we should always have hope because without hope, we can never be able to realize just how wonderful life can truly be. ""No man is a failure who has friends"" That is the basic moral of It's a Wonderful Life and it teaches us that you don't need money to be happy. The film is not necessarily a Christmas movie but it still preaches the ideology of the holiday and that is what characterizes it as a Christmas film. Indeed, it is perhaps the greatest Christmas movie of all time and one of the best films ever made in my opinion. Thank You Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart for giving us this masterpiece of the cinema.",

And there really is no arguing with that. It is a movie rife with sentimentality and a sugary touch by the great Frank Capra. But if that's a crime, so be it. If this holiday classic doesn't pull at your heartstrings, I can't help but feel a little sorry for you. For if you let it, 'It's a Wonderful Life' will whisk you away on an unforgettable journey.",

Like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) and You Can't Take It With You (1938) it focuses on the common man and claims they can have a stay in the system despite rich people like Jim Taylor in the first film and Mr. Kirby in the second. This film features George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) as a buildings and loan banker, who fights against the evil banker of the town, Potter. He, George, has a guardian angel who shows what it is like if he was never born. Still the movie is not really socialist or a criticism of capitalism at all, as the banker suffers no consequences for causing problems in the town, so it is strange American smultzy movie.",

It doesn't say anything about Christmas until at the end when he came back and everyone knew him again.

There's one part of the film that I'll never forget. It's what the bank is trying to do. I've heard that some American towns and streets are named after banks, and this movie made me realize that America was created by banks. A similar episode is also in ""Duel at Noon"". It was about a conflict in the city because they didn't like the city planning that the bank was aiming for, that one. I also heard that the famous Wyatt Earp actually had a fight with the bank after ""My Love Clementine"" and lost and left the town.

It is a loving tribute to everyone who knows the value of making a house a home, and making a place a community. Jimmy Stewart, as George Bailey, is able to effortlessly give us such a man, but he is also able to give us a flawed hero who is at the end of his rope. It is when he sees what life would be like without him that he truly appreciates his ""wonderful life.""  While this film was billed as a romance, and Donna Reed and Jimmy Stewart do not disappoint on that end, director Frank Capra is going for something deeper than romance.

670,25 December 2016,JosephPezzuto,8, Reel Look: It's A Wonderful Life,"""Remember, George: no man is a failure who has friends."" Frank Capra's portrayal of the average American everyman through his direction has been seen in his previous films, such as It Happened One Night, Mr. Deeds Goes To Town and Mr. Smith Goes To Washington. But none shines the brightest and boldest except here. Capra's American Christmas fantasy drama and personal favorite film (including Stewart's), 'It's a Wonderful Life' has initially, and belovedly, become a holiday favorite the years over. The story was originally written by Philip Van Doren Stern in November 1939, entitled ""The Greatest Gift"". Unsuccessful in getting his story published, he decided to make it into a Christmas card, mailing two hundred copies to family and friends in December 1943. In April 1944, RKO Pictures bought the rights to the film for $10,000, upon coming to the attention of producer David Hempstead, of whom showed it to Cary Grant's Hollywood agent. Hoping to make the story into a vehicle for Grant, RKO created three unsatisfactory scripts before finally shelving the planned movie, as Grant went on to make another Christmas movie staple, The Bishop's Wife. At the suggestion of RKO Studio chief Charles Koerner, Capra read ""The Greatest Gift"" and saw its potential immediately, later stating that this was the picture he was born to make. RKO sold the rights to Capra's own production company, Liberty Films, in 1945, of which had a nine-film distribution. The script underwent many revisions throughout pre-production and during filming. With the final screenplay credit going to Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett and Frank Capra (with uncredited input from Dorothy Parker, Clifford Odets and the infamously blacklisted Dalton Trumbo), the film was thus put into production after much anxiousness from RKO. Though a flop upon its release, losing $525,000 at the box office for RKO, it had to stand the test of time. By the 1960s, the film's copyright had expired, thus opening the floodgates for a ""public domain"" to be circulated for cheap and recurring television broadcasts. The film became a mainstay due to wholesome family viewing, especially due to the fact that it was repeated excessively during the holiday season. In the 1970s, public broadcasting stations set the film's reputation of quality in stone by scheduling the picture against the tactless network's commercial and materialistic costs, even becoming a victim of the colorization craze. By the 1980s due to numerous television showings, it had become a traditional holiday viewing during the Christmas season. So does this American holiday classic hold up even by today's standards to provoke even still to feel post viewing? Let's take a look.",

I didn't expect to get much out of it, since it didn't really seem like my kind of movie. After watching it, I realised how wrong I was. It was an absolutely beautiful movie, and really pulled at my heartstrings (although, as I've said in one of my other reviews, I'm an absolute sucker for emotional stuff like this). I won't go into too much detail about the plot, in case you don't know what it is, since it's a great experience going in not knowing about the plot. I'll simply say that it is a great portrayal of what one man can do without even realising it. Jimmy Stewart is in the starring role as the lovable George Bailey, a role that he is charming in. Some of the movie may seem a little corny by today's standards, but don't let that turn you off! It is also probably one of the most thought provoking movies I've ever seen as well. After watching it, I found myself thinking of what effect my own life has had on others, whether I could make a difference in anyone's life. It's the sort of movie that makes you want to be a better person. The movie is brilliant, and I'm glad I gave it a chance. It currently tops my Top 50 movies list, which is funny, considering how it doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of them. I've even been accused of faking my love for the movie! This is definitely a movie that needs to be seen. I've never seen anything else like it.",

677,25 October 2019,mill-48145,10, One of the Best,"The 1946 film, It's a Wonderful Life is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in history, mainly for it's histoprical depression-era storytelling and suicide prevention awareness. The film praised artistically for its precise editing and terrific acting. The film takes place during the Great Depression anShows the panic that ensued when the stock market crashed in 1932 and the true horrors of losing everything in the blink of an eye. The act of sacrifice is also a key point in the film. George and Mary sacrifice their honeymoon savings by loaning it out the bank customers until the bank can fully pay back all the money that was lost. The film also shows how serious suicide truly is and that even though your life may seem ruined and hopeless, its is still worth living for the people who surround and support you. PTSD is also a main theme of the story for George. Thankfulness is probably the biggest theme of the film. Throughout the story, George experiences his life without the things that he realizes truly how lucky he is. He learns that you have to be thankful for everything that life gives you. James Stewart really gives it his all as George Bailey, the main character. During his life journey throughout the film, you can feel the pain and sadness and when he is humbled at the end of the film, you feel his happiness and thankfulness through his terrific acting. He was awarded an Academy Award nomination for his performance. No wonder he was in 170 film & television productions. The supporting cast also does a great job. The 2 standouts are Donna Reed as Mary Hatch and Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter. Reed is great as Hatch due to her loyal and true love for George. She shows all of her emotions perfectly and helps create a likeable love interest for George. Barrymore is possibly even better as George's work rival, Mr. Potter. He really gives Potter a sinister twist. He helps act like a real villain whose intention is to corrupt the main character. He does a great job and it truly shows in the film. The film is set during winter, with the streets full of snow. Capra was used to the industry norm of using painted cornflakes, but wanted to create a new method. The special effects team created a new way to show film on screen. They mixed the foam from fire extinguishers with soap flakes, water, and sugar. The mixture was then sprayed onto set using a wind blower. This was revolutionary and earned the team an Academy Award. Another special effect used to express the film's weather, was the sound technique. Instead of later dubbing the actor's lines over the loud sounding snow in post production, they did it their own way. They recorded audio from filming and used it raw. They made the snow sound smooth and not so thick, so the actor's lines could be heard. These techniques were extremely important are still being used for films today and for years to come. Overall, the film It's a Wonderful Life is a very important film due to its historical significance and artistic brilliance. This film is still considered one of the best nearly 70 years after its release and will remain one of the best for years to come.",

I found it annoying that when the angel was showing George how other peoples life would be if he hadn't been born, and he kept thinking that everyone knew him. The angel told him that no one would know him, yet he kept on insisting that they knew him. I also didn't like that it was bad for Mary to become an old maid. I understand that back then if a young woman didn't get married it was considered bad. But that is just something that I didn't like that they had in the movie. Besides all of this it was a good movie. I'm most likely not going to watch it again, but the theme behind the movie was a good idea.",

But then it came into public domain and was revived by TV where it came into classic status as a beloved holiday film. Having seen it so many times, I almost forgot how good the acting, set design, and direction are. Look and you will see the subtleties crammed into every nook and cranny. The movements of the extras. The lived in feel of the town. The sidewalk walkers and animals roaming around. Everything breathes realism, yet the story is not one of stark realism, but of ideals.",

By the end of the movie, when all his friends and family come together to help him, the tears came flooding thick and fast. I think it is a sad thing that I'm only 16 and that seeing such brotherly love between him and people who barely knew him was so strange to me. I cried not only for the happy ending, but for the fact that this movie, made less than 70 years ago and that the world it shows no longer exists.

693,17 January 2006,dantown,10, The finest American movie ever made,"Jimmy Stewart doesn't merely act this role, as a sad, yet monumentally blessed man of the people. He almost SINGS it, due to his gift for vocal histrionics. This story of one man against the planetary tides of fate is an absolutely thrilling exposition of film excellence. Each centimeter of this movie is filled with Life. That is the sly double-meaning of this movie. I command you to find another movie its equal. This is a movie even the great philosopher Aristotle, and his Poetics, would love. All film-makers, and all film-lovers should fill their souls with this great achievement. It is the archetypal story of grandeur in plainness. But not too plain. It is a Deus Ex Machina, where a little itty bitty man, struggling against evil, is suddenly and magically healed, and yet, finds himself pushing the same rock up the same hill. The Gods have transformed his struggle into a spiritual triumph. Same Old Sisyphus, same old rock. This movie collapses and conflates a monumental struggle into a warm, and sappy and beautiful Christmas card. There will be a long time, if ever, that a movie ever accomplishes as much. I approach this movie the way a grasshopper appreciates a spider's web, once his leg is fatally caught. I cannot escape it. I marvel at the art it displays.",

695,20 April 2006,icu_999,6, Average movie,"I think it's an average movie. It's got classical Hollywood propaganda- and politics. I think people tend to ignore the undertones of trying to get people to stay in the 'homeland' of America. There's also political messages about democracy and individualism, as well as small messages about family life and propaganda about the war. It's good in that it gets people to appreciate life, yet it seems to discourage people to aim higher. For some people having a wife and kids and friends is nice, but for some they have other goals. Seeing the world and achieving ones goals is important, we can't all accept second best. We have to be selfish in some ways if we are to get what we want.

I was never a fan of films from pre-1960's, and had always thought they were inappropriately dramatic, poorly acted, and boring.  It's a Wonderful Life may be one of the few exceptions to this.  I thought the movie was phenomenal.  The acting, script, and plot was incredible.  Some of the lines were so simple and yet the acting made it all come alive.  At the end of the movie, there is a featurette called ""The Making of It's a Wonderful Life.""  It was revealed that the actor/actress forgot several pages worth of script lines in several scenes, but the acting was so great that the director decided to trash that segment of the script.  This might might have been the ingredient that saved this movie from the boredom that plagues most films from this era.  Without going into the spoilers, I will just say that this is definitely one of the top 5 feel-good dramas of the century, and the IMDB votes certainly reflect this.  So why didn't this film do well in the box office?  The featurette covers this in detail, but watch the movie and decide for yourself.",

Capra was unsophisticated, we're told. His film is unsophisticated, we're told. But there is such a thing as emotional sophistication, and often the other kind serves only to render a man unable to articulate just what life is like, emotionally, how deep the despair and how high the exultation. This movie should be a book of the Bible.",
