0,1 November 2019,acedj,10, Just wow,"When this came out, I was living with a roommate. He went out and saw it, came home and said, ""Dude, you have to go see The Matrix."" So we left and he sat through it a second time. This movie is splendidly done. The mystery about what the Matrix is, unravels and you see a dystopian future unlike any we as a race would want. I have watched this over and over and never tire of it. Everyone does a great job acting in this, the special effects are above par and the story is engaging.",/

Never before has a film made me question the nature of reality before. At first glance, The Matrix at the surface might have looked like a really good action movie with some cutting edge special effects with a kinetic and engaging story, and it definitely has that, but on my first viewing of this movie back in 2006 when I was 9 years old and slid this DVD into my small box TV at the end of my bed.

6,2 December 2005,MinorityReporter,10," Immensely entertaining, intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!","Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.",w

20,20 August 2019,Hitchcoc,9, Wow! I Finally Saw It!,"This is one of those movies that ""everyone"" has seen, except me. I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years. But, it keeps one on edge with its special effects and its non-stop action.",e

30,24 September 2013,zardoz-13,10, Cyberescapism Galore!!!,"Co-directors Andy and Larry (now Lana) Wachowski fashioned one of the most revolutionary science fiction sagas of all time with the cyberspace thriller ""The Matrix"" with Keanu Reeves, Lawrence Fishburne, Carrie Ann Moss, and Hugo Weaving. The first of a trilogy, this 136-minute, allegorical actioneer pits a group of resistance fighters led by Neo and Trinity against the status quo villainy of 21st century henchmen who wear suits and ties with sunglasses. The pioneering ""bullet time"" cinematography is as incredible as the action is audacious. Nothing is what it appears to be in ""The Matrix."" The Wachowskis have appropriated a little bit of everything for their derivative but striking cyberescapism. They have incorporated philosophy, martial arts combat, Greek mythology, Biblical themes, and ideas from movies such as ""Strange Days"" and ""Dark City."" Legendary martial arts choreographer Woo-ping Yuen has staged some kinetic gravity-defying, close-quarters combat sequences. Carrie Ann-Moss never made another movie that matched ""The Matrix."" The first scene when she runs up walls to elude the police, bounds across rooftops, and hurls herself like Peter Pan over a street is sensational. This computer generated scene gets the action off to a dynamic start and the Wachowskis never let the pace lag even when things get a little convoluted. Laurence Fishburne behaves like John the Baptist from the Bible, and Hugo Weaving makes a diabolical villain. ""The Matrix"" belongs in the top 100 science fiction films of all time.",
31,18 December 2021,aidanratesmovies,10, Once in a lifetime film experience,"Never will there be a film that can harness the creative worldbuilding, mind blowing story, and intricate themes of social commentary as well as The Matrix can. I first watched this film when I was merely 12, and was absolutely blown away by it, and rewatching it now, i'm so glad to catch so many little things that add to the depth of this film and its storytelling. The Wachowski's have created something masterful here, creating a dystopian sci-fi world unlike any other before it and managing to not only build upon it greatly throughout the film but allow the audience to be immersed within it as well. It's a movie that makes you think, and it may start off a bit slow because of that, but it knows what it's trying to do, and it doesn't need to apologize for it. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss provide for excellent leads throughout the film. The cinematography is unique and gritty, its action style more than entertaining, and its deeper themes of societal norms and challenges make for quite an interesting commentary. Its special effects may not have aged very well today, but at the time they were quite unique and it fits the films vibe in a way that truly has to be seen to be believed. In the end, The Matrix is a sci-fi masterpiece and no one can tell me otherwise. Its an intricate and beautifully executed blend of action, sci-fi, and potential and just may be one of my favorite films the 1990's had to offer.",

33,26 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,9, Effects-fuelled sci-fi extravaganza,"What is THE MATRIX? Well, let me tell you: it's a crowd-pleasing science fiction adventure, which took audiences by surprise as it came out of nowhere and totally destroyed the year's other big sci-fi epic, THE PHANTOM MENACE. The reason for its success is quite obvious when you look at it. The film isn't just about special effects, although they do play a big part; it also has a rather complex and classic sci-fi set up. While STAR WARS was all bad special effects and little else, THE MATRIX is all good special effects and a lot more besides.",

Previous to this movie, most science-fiction movies consisted out of scene's in space with spacecrafts, aliens, all set in a futuristic world. Most movies that tried to be different from this, mostly failed. ""The Matrix"" does however does not fail and it redefined the science-fiction genre and has taken it to a whole different and more seriously taken level of movie-making. The movie has inspired many different movies ever since and showed that science-fiction and action elements are a great and spectacular combination.

The camera angles really work for the action sequences and the choreographed fight scenes made me yearn for more.  Say what you want about Keanu Reeves' acting.  He may not deliver the best dialogue, but his look can carry a film.  He was a great choice for the role of Neo.  Carrie Anne Moss was great as was the underrated Laurence Fishburne.

74,9 April 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, Could this possibly have been any better?,"I base this on the Ultimate 10-Disc Set. An entire decade after this came out, it still holds up incredibly well. It simply has so much to offer... all that food for thought, different beliefs, tons of themes that are explored and such immense room for interpretation, with very little in this being certain or definite. The plot is excellent, develops well, and combines various interesting ideas(and no, they weren't original, they weren't meant to be... this puts a lot of fascinating concepts together, and presents them all for the mainstream audience). Granted, it spawned a ton of suddenly enlightened pocket philosophers with little doubt as to their own prowess, but with anything this influential, there are going to be some negative results. The pacing is spot-on, not a moment of this is too long or overly short. The action is astounding, exciting, fun, entertaining and awesome, and they manage to do amazing and memorable sequences. No, perhaps it does not dodge all of the clich√©s. The slow-motion(and bits clearly inspired by John Woo) and other tools appeared before this, yes, the point isn't that they were new... it's the way this uses them, and creates a unique style. Mixing Noir, Anim√© and countless allusions, and doing so with expert-like skill is an impressive feat. The Bullet-Time was invented for this, and it is fantastic. The martial arts, the choreography, the moves, magnificent. The effects are stunning and seamless, to this day. The cinematography and editing are perfect, and enormously well-planned. The mood and atmosphere is masterfully achieved. The acting is quite good, Reeves fits, Moss and Fishburne are marvelous, and Weaving is utterly impeccable. The dialog is almost completely invariably well-written, and well-delivered. There is no nudity or sexuality, at most hints thereof. There is language, moderately harsh, albeit not too bad in frequency. The DVD holds a text introduction(to the following) by the Wachowski's, that makes for a great read, as well as two commentary tracks, one of philosophers who enjoyed the film, Dr. Cornel West & Ken Wilder, and one of critics who did not care for it, Todd McCarthy, John Powers & David Thompson. These are worth listening to. I recommend this to any fan of science fiction, and anyone who wishes to be encouraged to think by what they watch. 10/10",

Time has not been kind to the franchise that was The Matrix: the two back to back produced sequels, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, were met with critical derision and public indifference, especially Revolutions, which did not live up to the box-office success of Reloaded.

Now, most people think this film is intelligent, but I thought that is was incredibly long and was almost entirely plotless. It's a shame at how the characters act so serious that you don't know what they are talking about. Another problem I have with the Matrix were the incredibly overrated effects. First of all, I can't understand why the Matrix won the Visual Effects Oscar over the Phantom Menace, which took much more effort and used much more technology. I see so many unoriginalities with the Matrix's effects. People who think that the Bullet Time effects were original and told the story, you obviously haven't seen the slow-motion bullets in Face/Off, which I personally found more eye-catching. And for people who think that the story about a computer programmer entering a virtual reality world, you obviously haven't seen the Walt Disney masterpiece Tron, which, by the way, had far more groundbreaking technology for its day than the Matrix's effects had when it was first made.

The story's arch is quite good in that it doesn't feel as though much of anything else could be added. The central philosophy is admirably brought to a movie that a mainstream audience can digest, along with metaphorical and allegorical strains of the bible, alice in wonderland, drug use, the life cycle, cartesian dualism, buddhist one consciousness, giger style enemies, artificial intelligence, newtonian physics, orwellian nightmares, and euclidean view of the world as a series of numbers and probabilities. Sci fi need not be the same old, evil monster chase humans without rhyme or reason. The movie dooes sidestep charecter development by making it's charecters not know who they are, and also by killing most of them off as soon as they are met. while this isn't the arty pretentious greatness of citizen kane or waking life, it is a movie that is likely to be long remembered and worshipped like Star Wars",

On many occasions, I have heard grand statements from its fans, about the incredible, thought provoking story. The whole 'What is Reality?' issue. Well, actually, in Science Fiction, this is a pretty well-trod concept. Oddly enough, the Matrix escaped its SF roots, and managed to be seen by a wider audience who were unfamiliar with SF or its concepts. As a result, there were resounding cries of how original and creative it was. Is it good that it made a few more people think? Yes. Does that by default mean that it did it well? Films such as ""ExistenZ"", ""Dark City"", or ""The 13th Floor"" (from around the same time), all explored the idea of 'What is Reality?' in far more depth. They simply didn't get the same level of exposure. The Matrix wins, because it was one of those lucky films to fill the right niche at the right time. It utilized Computer Effects in a relatively new way for the cinema 'wow' factor. It appealed to the all-action, gun-toting, look-cool-in-black leather, fans. It rammed the 'kung-fu-wire-stunt' style of action film into over-drive. It had a 'hip' soundtrack to appeal to the masses (Which will date it badly in years to come).",

THE MATRIX hasn`t been helped either by the amount of spoofs/rip offs featuring the scenes where the action stops , the frame freezes , the camera turns 360 degrees and then the action starts again . These scenes were jaw dropping at the time but have now been done by countless ads , pop videos and other movies it`s become impossible now to remember the impact this cinematography technique had at the time .

The most satisfying or convincing thing about this movie is that even the villain's character is also justifiable. Most of the humans try to be in a comfort zone and wants to be ignorant all their lives, which is a natural human tendency, I believe.

It's a bit outdated now but it still left a mark in cinema and inspired a lot of movie and more to come.

I am not going to get in depth with the story but I will just say that it's pretty clever without it being overly complex. This is probably Keanu Reeves's trademark movie and I can't picture anyone else taking the role of Neo besides him. And glad that someone like Will Smith didn't end up with this role. Nothing against Will Smith but Keanu Reeves is just the better candidate. He was just perfect for a movie like this and fit the image of a average cool hacker that gets picked or chosen to do something much much greater. Even the mentor character Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne) and the main villain Agent Smith played by Hugo Weaving are excellent choices for the roles they were given. The action was super cool and even amazing when this movie first came out. In fact it's the first movie I seen that blends slow motion and bullet time in a effective manner in a movie. It tries to combine so many stuff into this one film but it does it right. One of it is the anime film ""Ghost in the Shell"" which obviously played a huge part in inspiring the Wachowski brothers. Overall this is a cool and entertaining movie with some wicked ideas that all sci-fi movie watchers shouldn't miss out on...Well it's been out for more than a decade.

Unlike many of those people, I wasn't particularly blown away. While I found the ideas in the story interesting, I didn't find the way they were explored to be especially engaging. I really liked some of the effects, but thought mainly of how much I would like to see them used in a better movie. Then I left the theatre with my two friends, one a homosexual artist, the other a theology student, and they both talked and talked and talked about the impressive visuals, philosophical symbolism and deep ideas present in the film. After around 30 minutes in conversation I was asked for my opinion. Not wanting to lie, I was frank. ""Guys, 90% of that movie was as clich√© as hell (may not have been the exact word I used)"" Silence is golden.",

This overlong, high concept hokum is little more than a bloated, mechanical, and tiresome film which is big on visuals and short on story. Bland, androgynous Keanu Reeves plays a 22nd-century computer hacker who is recruited by Carrie-Anne Moss to join a band of cyber freedom fighters led by Morpheus in a struggle against the scary, menacing machines that control mankind. The result is an eye-popping, deafening and mind-numbing muddled mayhem and possibly the least humane, least responsible, least pardonable movie I have ever seen.",

""You are like everyone, born a slave, you were born in a prison you can't perceive""
This conjecture is shocking enough, but the depth of ""The Matrix"" does not stop there, it also raises new questions on this basis:
Will you choose blue pills or red pills?
Is it to choose a beautiful illusion or a cruel reality?
On the surface, it seems to be a good choice, but it is actually much more difficult than we thought.
On one side is the future world of apocalypse, torn by hunger and cold, and the danger of being chased by robots
On one side is a warm and peaceful era, with blue sky and white clouds, beautiful scenery, and even the opportunity to become a successful person.
Indeed, everyone knows that no matter how beautiful the dream is, it is just a dream.
But Sever is willing to sell everyone for a dream.
If we really escape the matrix and experience the cruelty of reality, maybe we will make the same choice as Sever.
Just as when you have a beautiful dream, you would rather stay in the dream than wake up.",

204,23 June 2005,jboothmillard,10, The Matrix,"This is considered by many to be a milestone of movies, that pushed the boundaries of imagination and digital-effects technology further, and I'm very happy I watched it to confirm this status, written, produced and directed by the Wachowskis (Bound, Speed Racer, Cloud Atlas). Basically, in an abandoned hotel in a major city, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) is cornered by the police but overpowers them with superhuman abilities. He is chased whilst fleeing by the police and a group of black suited Agents, with similar superhuman abilities. She escapes by answering a ringing phone in a public telephone booth and vanishes. Computer programmer and hacker Thomas Anderson, known by his alias ""Neo"" (Keanu Reeves), is confused by repeated online encounters with something called ""the Matrix"", and seeing the phrase ""Follow the White Rabbit"". He is approached by Trinity in a rave bar, she tells him he is in great danger, that they are watching him and that he is searching for answers, particularly to the most important question of all: what is the Matrix? The following morning, at Neo's job at Metacortex, a leading software company, a team of Agents and police, led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), arrive searching for him. Neo is contacted by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), an infamous hacker, who attempts to guide him to safety, but he surrenders rather than risking his life trying to escape. The Agents attempt to coerce Neo into helping them locate Morpheus, who they claim is a terrorist. When Neo refuses, the agents fuse his mouth shut and implant a robotic ""bug"" in his stomach. Neo awakens believing that he had a nightmare. Soon after, Neo is taken by Trinity to meet Morpheus, and she removes the bug from Neo, proving what he experienced was real. Morpheus offers Neo a choice between two pills: the blue pill will return him to his former life, the red pill will reveal the truth about the Matrix. Neo chooses to take the red pill, his reality begins to distort, and he awakens in a liquid-filled pod among countless others, containing other human beings. He is then brought aboard Morpheus' flying ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. As Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the situation: a war broke out between the human race and intelligent machines in the early 21st century, when the humans blocked the machines from accessing solar energy, the machines responded by capturing humans and harvesting their bioelectric power with their minds being trapped in the Matrix, a shared simulation of the real world that existed in 1999. The machines won the war, and the remaining free humans took refuge in the underground city of Zion. Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to ""unplug"" enslaved humans and recruit them, and the Matrix's simulated nature allows them to bend its physical laws. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix would mean death to a real physical body, that the Agents are sentient programs that eliminate threats to the system, and, in the real world, machines called Sentinels are hunting the rebels. Morpheus virtually trains Neo with everything that is possible within the understanding of the Matrix, from kung fu fighting to firing weapons. Neo displays great ability and skill, cementing Morpheus' belief that he is ""The One"", a human prophesied to free humankind. The group enters the Matrix to visit the Oracle (Gloria Foster), the prophet who predicted that the One would emerge. She implies to Neo that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus' life and his own. Before they can leave the Matrix, Agents and police have been tipped off by disgruntled crew member Cypher (Joe Pantoliano). He has tipped off the Agents to ambush the group in exchange to return to a comfortable life back in the Matrix. Morpheus buys time for the others by fighting with Agent Smith and is captured, while Mouse (Matt Doran) is shot to death. Cypher exits the Matrix and murders crew members Apoc (Julian Arahanga) and Switch (Belinda McClory), while they are unconscious and connected. Before he can kill Neo and Trinity, crew member Tank (Marcus Chong) regains consciousness and kills Cypher before pulling Neo and Trinity from the Matrix. The Agents interrogate Morpheus to gain the access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion, which would allow them to destroy it. Neo is determined to return to the Matrix to rescue him, as the Oracle prophesied; Trinity insists she goes with him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to those of the Agents. As Morpheus and Trinity safely exit the Matrix, Smith ambushes and kills Neo. While a group of Sentinels attack the Nebuchadnezzar, Trinity confesses her love for Neo and says the Oracle told her she would fall in love with the One. Neo is revived with newfound abilities to perceive and control the Matrix, he then leaps into Smith's body and causes him to explode, while the other Agents flee. He makes it out of the Matrix just as the ship's EMP (electromagnetic pulse) is activated and disables the attacking Sentinels inside the ship. Back in the Matrix, Neo makes a telephone call, promising the machines that he will show their prisoners ""a world where anything is possible"". He hangs up and flies away. Also starring Anthony Ray Parker as Dozer, Paul Goddard as Agent Brown, Robert Taylor as Agent Jones, David Aston as Rhineheart, Marc Aden Gray as Choi, Ada Nicodemou as Dujoir (White Rabbit Girl) and Deni Gordon as Priestess. Reeves gives a good performance as the recluse who may be saviour of humanity from cyberspace slavery, Fishburne is really likeable as the inspirational leader and teacher, Moss is terrific as the beautiful feisty love interest, Weaving enjoys himself being the snarling villain, and Pantoliano does well in his time onscreen. You can just about follow what's going on if you really concentrate (the colouring, green for the Matrix world and blue for the real world, it certainly helps you decipher), with complex theories of philosophy and ancient mysticism, otherwise you can just enjoy it for its thrilling fight and chase sequences, fast and slow-motion, spectacular special effects, and amazing visuals, an impressive and unmissable science-fiction action. It won the Oscars for Best Editing, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound, and it won the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects, and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, and Best Production Design. It was number 66 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!",

212,14 November 2000,Mendelovich,1, My big disappointment,"I must say that I am a small admirer of sci-fi movies. Nevertheless, I have always liked good action, even if it happens in outer space. I must remind you here great movies, like ""Total Recall"", ""Terminator"" and ""Star Wars"". These movies captured my phantasy and my curiosity. Great expectations I had when I started watching Matrix. I have heard so much about its deep dialogs and its special effects. In reality, those hopes collapsed in face of this movie. I have to confess that it is absolutely awful. Nothing more and nothing less. The dialogs are sprinkled with a myriad of pseudo-philosophic sentences, which are intended to awake in us deep thoughts. Well, it didn't arouse anything in me but boredom. I do not accept that Morphius has some kind of deep perspective on life and I do not accept Neo's battle with himself as representing something in our lives. The movie has engaged in a circle of happenings which do not take us anywhere. All the passes between the real world and the Matrix world are so casual and unsophisticated, that it puzzled me. I do not understand why did the producers of this movie bother with so many transitions between the worlds, when nothing really happens, and the basic difference between the worlds is always maintained. Lastly, I was deeply disappointed in the special effects. They are so simplistic and so few that I wonder whether this film should even be classified as a modern sci-fi.  My final conclusion would be that this movie has become some kind of culture item, and people were grasped by its media-magic. Two years after its release, it's so vane. Try to see it now, and you will be convinced.",

I've taken college courses in philosophy and the concept of this film has been used to spark in-class discussions on what is existence, what it means to exist, is there a higher power, ect.

There, I've said it. To question the realness of reality is a 400-year old Cartesian idea. Actually, it was explored more interestingly in the old Star Trek episode ""Spectre of the Gun"" in 1969. The rest of the film is an obvious rip-off of ""The Terminator"" and all of John Woo, which are far more interesting movies. The film ponders too long on the central premise, and there isn't enough action to make it a good action movie, either. Still, overall production design is great, but the acting is wooden, and Fishburne makes for an unconvincing guru.

This film requires the usual sci-fi suspension of disbelief but has several things going for it:  the characters are actually developed in a detective-movie-noirish way, the hero and others struggle with decisions and THEN act, as opposed to JUST doing something, and most obviously the film has a color-and-costuming visual style that remains a bold statement throughout the production.

Unsure as to why he has become so sought after, he decides to place his allegiances with the latter. After a number of trials and tribulations, Neo is brought face-to-face with Morpheus, the leader of the said group and he is awakened to a reality he had no idea existed: the world, as we know it, is an illusion. Neo has been participating in a virtual reality created by intelligent robots, robots who defeated human beings in a war waged many years ago. This virtual reality is known as the Matrix, and it exists so that the robots can keep their former human masters docile and unobstructive. The machines also profit from using comatose human beings as a power-source for their real world. This discovery by itself proves to be understandably challenging for Neo to accept, but there is more.",

It is a deceitful, spurious and incredibly pretentious film. Because one thing is Cinema and another thing are computers. If you want to said something in cinema' way you must use cinematography ways. Cinematography language has got his own implements. It is a very old discovery (more than 100 years old) and it was marching on and growing up with hard work, effort, wisdom and -many times- talent. Never with computers.

251,7 March 2003,Aaron1375,8, A very good movie...but a bit overrated.,"I gave this movie a solid 8, but I definitely have seen plenty of movies that I have enjoyed more over the years.  What gets me is all the people who act like this movie is so original.  What is original about it?  It is basically a combination of the Terminator movies and any number of virtual reality movies that were released prior to this one including Johnny Mnemonic also starring Reeves.  Heck, it wasn't even the first movie to use bullet time as the movie Blade was the first time I had seen that done in a movie, granted on a much smaller scale.  Also, I think it was seen in a Korn music video as well before this movie ever came into being.  So this movie just borrows, for the most part, from a bunch of different movies and other entertainment.  Still it is good, though the parts that are the best take place in the matrix.  Some of the real world scenes are quite frankly boring.  The second time I watched this one I was basically thinking, ""Come on, capture Morpheus already so we can get to the good part of the flick"". The action at the end of this movie, more than makes up for the many dry spells in the flick.  Reeves and Fishburne are good as well, though I could have done without some of their talking scenes and their fight wasn't anything special either.  Like I said, I loved the movie when they were in the matrix and not as much when they weren't.  I hear the third installment will be entirely set in the real world too, so I don't have high hopes for it.  Carrie Ann Moss wasn't anything special in this either...if it wasn't for this movie who would ever of heard of her?  Let's face it, you could have put anyone in that role and they could have performed just as well are better.  She isn't very good looking either.  All in all it is worth checking out cause of the great action at the end, and because Hugo Weaving is great as the villain.",

It may be surprising that I haven't seen this before but I have now so let's move on. I'll just get right into it: this might be my favorite movie. Obviously I'd probably need to rewatch a few times to see if it truly is, but yeah I thought this was a flawless movie. From the opening scene this movie gripped me and my attention didn't waver the entire film. The Matrix has such an amazing concept going for it, and I won't spoil anything at all in case you've never seen it, but this concept has handled so well. It has a lot of biblical and philosophical things behind it that just make it incredibly fascinating to watch. The story, plot, and screenplay were all handled amazingly and the word building is flawless. Keanu Reeves plays our protagonist, Neo, and he goes through this hero's journey that is just handled expertly. The movie looks amazing and has such a distinct style that makes it stand out from everything else. The action might not be your cup of tea, but I thought it was thoroughly entertaining. Even if the action isn't your thing, the best part here is that the movie doesn't make itself about action. Everything that's not action is just done so well, the movie has such an incredible amount of tension, suspense, and momentum. My only problem with this movie is that it ends. I was genuinely depressed when this ended. The movie was not only a super fun ride, a super well crafted ride, but it made me think about life from a different perspective. I'd be glad to discuss this movie more with anyone, but I'm on mobile so I'll end the review here. 10/10, a perfect masterpiece.",

The movie is still a great sci-fi flick and worthy of being called one of the best. The fights scenes, although a little slow this day and age, are well choreographed and heavy hitting - I particularly enjoy when people get thrown against or through walls and this movie has plenty of that! The bullet time effects and slow motion shots still hold up, and even though other films have copied it, The Matrix was the original and still does it better if you ask me. The storyline still feels futuristic even after 22 years and the CGI, although looking a tad dated, is still pretty sharp mostly (better than what was in the sequel, The Matrix Reloaded, oddly). The story can get a little confusing at times for new comers, infact there were things in this viewing that I had not picked up on or understood previously so just one viewing may not be enough to truely appreciate the film. The one thing the film didn't do for me however was the emotional relationships - I liked the characters, but the relationship between Neo and Trinity felt a bit forced for my liking.
