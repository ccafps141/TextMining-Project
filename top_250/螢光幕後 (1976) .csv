0,22 February 2005,nycritic,10, The Age of Network,"Thirty years after its release to public praise and multiple Oscar wins, Network is one of those films that instead of dating badly or becoming a product of its time has actually grown and become even more relevant today, and if it were re-released in 2006 for its actual thirtieth anniversary not on film but on national television right at the beginning of the fall season (complete with the most lurid reality TV shows and inane TV pleasers), it would only become more justified in its story.",/

I strain to think of a film that is a more brilliant take on society, and all of the flaws it has. It's obedience and entertainment by those who rebel, no matter how insane they are. The exploitation of those in peril for any kind of economic profit. And the fact that everything Beale preaches is completely true and completely bashes the people who are producing him. I was amazed by how much he sells out while continuing to rant about how terrible the people he works for are, and the fact that they just keep him on the air because they want ratings.",e

5,2 May 1999,Coxer99,10, Network,"Engrossing satire from Paddy Chayefsky and Sidney Lumet about sensationalism and the almighty dollar in television. All the performances astound, especially Beatty as the tycoon who tells Peter Finch his ideal America and his ideal philosophy on where America is heading. The film is a fine mix of black comedy and drama, brought to life by Chayefsky's incredible script and Lumet's superb direction. Dunaway won a much deserved Oscar for her performance. It's a performance that makes your jaw drop to the floor from start to finish. She makes being a bitch look so darn good.",e
6,28 December 2005,Putzberger,10," We Have Seen the Future, And It Sucks","This movie came out when I was nine years old, and I saw it on network TV the following year, lured by the brouhaha that surrounded the use of the ""barnyard epithet"" during prime time. I loved this movie before I understood it, and I worship it now. Like ""Elmer Gantry"" or ""1984,"" it's a work of didactic art that only fails on an imaginative level -- Sinclair Lewis couldn't grasp how debased evangelism would become, Orwell couldn't foresee the excesses of Mao or Pol Pot, and Chayevsky couldn't envision the absolute decline of television from a vast wasteland to a malevolent sewer. Fox News, reality TV, even the OJ chase, ""Network"" anticipates every vile bit of it.",w

8,29 May 2006,Quinoa1984,10," Not just the sharp-as-a-tack dialog, but the key performances and the look of the film are enduring","This is one of those works that is emblematic of what can be done with a director who knows his craft and chooses a style that is both controlled and not controlling, a writer who can let out some wild scenes and incredible exposition and make it practically believable (maybe more so today), and a cast that understand their creative forces at work. After seeing the film I was actually struck just as much, for example, by William Holden's performance as I was by Peter Finch, though the latter usually gets most of the credit (and rightfully so, in an Oscar-winning turn beating out De Niro in Taxi Driver if one can believe that). But then one has to take into account their different levels of skill in their performances, and how they both deliver even more than what is required. Holden, for me, is just as good here as he is in his best work (Sunset Blvd, The Wild Bunch), but in the role of the worn-out, dedicated professional who in his own way has had about as enough bs that can be taken as the main character. Yet Holden also knows his performance needs to be more reserved, and as his story gets more complicated he has to make some subtle choices as perhaps the only really sane person in the film. His work here is accomplished in the style of one sense, while Finch, who plays a character going back and forth between being totally nuts and knowing more than anyone else out there in TV land, takes his role with a heedless abandon.",r

10,6 April 2006,Hitchcoc,9, It's What Television Has Become,"Imagine a world where the news is controlled by conglomerates, where bad taste is the norm, where we no longer want journalists but entertainers, where we will exploit anyone for ratings. Oh, wait, that's what happened. This movie was an omen. Watch it today and you will see that what seemed shocking and incredible, is much like many of our news networks today. We have right and left slinging mud. We have reality shows that make the news, full of disgusting interactions among people. The Jerry Springer influence is all over the place. We even have shows to create our next entertainers. Don't be surprised if in the near future we televise executions. ""Network"" saw the handwriting on the wall and simply put it out there. Like Capra's ""Meet John Doe,"" this is the blood lust of the populace laid bare. It's a reflection of a nation that is so full of itself that it has become bored with the mundane and the pleasurable. This movie capitalizes on those feelings. Now we find out that huge corporations are buying up newspapers and television stations and have the blessing of the power structure in Washington. Can you say ""1984."" I used to think that this was conspiracy theory. Let's hope that what Faye Dunnaway is planning in this film doesn't come totally true because when news is manipulated, we lose our last bit of control of the decision makers.",6

12,20 January 2008,Andrea-Orsini-1,10, A Prophet known as Paddy Chayefsky,"To think that this blackest of black comedies was made in 1976 could only means two things: 1) Nothing has changed or 2) Paddy Chayefsky was seeing the future with the most disturbing clarity. I endorse the later of the two because I believe things have changed since 1974 - I wasn't born yet, but I know because of my parents, the movies, literature, etc, etc, etc. Peter Finch as the mad prophet of the airwaves gives Chayefsky a riveting and powerful voice. The scenes between old chums Finch and William Holden are some of the best written scenes in any American movie until the Coen brothers emerged. Finch is superb, superb! and Holden, at the end of a legendary career, gives a performance of such ferocious sincerity that I rediscovered the man, the actor and felt the need to revisit some of his opus. From Golden Boy to Sunset Boulevard, Holden was a man who carried his own discomfort as a weapon. Extraordinary! However, the most alarming character in the whole thing is Faye Dunaway's. She is magnificent in her thin, nervous, bra-less attitude. She is a monster of commercial amorality. Everything in this incredible movie moves with the precision of an inspired clairvoyant's vision. Duvall's executive, Beatrice Straight's betrayed wife and Ned Beatty's god like big shot makes this one of the most frightening, entertaining, funniest, remarkable film from the 70's. Sidney Lumet proves once more that he's as good as his material. Here he is at his zenith.",7
13,23 November 2017,corazontvc,9," Only surprise is, it wasn't cynical enough","I recently rewatched this movie I've seen at least a dozen times and capture something new every time. It's a complete no holds barred hollowing out of the television industry, and, while television isn't the all looming force it once was (500 channels as opposed to around 7 including PBS and VHF and UHF at the time of this movie, depending on location), it still has much to say about the dissociation from reality that viewing things on a screen can create, especially when what you're witnessing is designed for the most craven response.",9

18,28 April 2005,dataconflossmoor,10, Guess What?..Everything is a Commodity!!,"Groundbreaking is the term for this movie...It is considered one of the hundred best movies ever made and for very good reason...Director Sidney Lummet has a reputation for the director of the non-conventional!!...A cogency for making the absolute truth a guileless villain, a rude awakening for television viewers, and a stubborn scripture for facts is what purports a film like Network as a masterpiece for the prolific and intellectual!! You could not ask for better acting!! The acting in this movie is second to none!! Robert Duvall, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch, Ned Beatty and a whole list of others...Perhaps the best acting in any film made whatsoever!! It starts with Howard Beale (Peter Finch) a victim of his own human pitfalls...Ossified and dejected from his declining years going from bad to worse, he becomes isolated, desultory ,morbid and morose and feels his life has no meaning, he threatens suicide on live television and is discarded as being a wacko!!...At first!!..but guess what!! he's a hit!!...So the ratings crazed cutthroats make him an instant success by labeling him ""The Angry Prophet Denouncing the Hypocracies of Our Time""...As long as we've gone this far, let's break all of the rules...Bring on the terrorists, the soothsayers, the insurectionaries, the financial gurus, the faith healers, and the para military radicals, to reduce the severity of hard bitten news to a side show of carnival freaks!!! William Holden plays the old school business man with ""primal doubts"" about his life in general...""male menopause"" with ""defineable features"" He is happily married yet after being bombarded from all sides in the autumn of his years, he is frightened that the new generation is impervious to basic tenets of human morality such as ethics and compassion...The woman with whom he gets involved, is callous not because she is vindictive, but because she is emotionless!! This woman (Faye Dunaway) is the ""Television Incarnate"" Ice Queen who reduces time and space to ""split seconds and instant replays"" the daily business of life is a ""corrupt comedy"" and the only redeeming quality to modern marvels and a ""radiant eruption of Democracy"" is that it gets a 32 share!!...This acting performance is perhaps the best acting performance I have ever seen...The type of person Dianna Christensen was supposed to be was played out perfectly...The delivery of the elaborated monologues and diatribes were absolutely remarkable....She was ideologically explosive yet person-ably obtuse. You knew why she wasn't the drinking type...she was too emotionally detached...In the thick of women's liberation, whereby a woman wanted to be just like a man, this movie portrayed how being just like a man had it's drawbacks!! ""Arousing quickly, consummating prematurely"" and suffering from the cumbersome fate of being crippled by ineptitude at everything else but your work, made Dianna Christensen perennially wistful of testosterone laden aggression!! Aggregately, she invoked societal demise through channels of deductive reasoning!! Director, Sidney Lummet, was insistent that Dianna Christensen be utterly devoid of vulnerability!! Mr Hackett (Robert Duvall) played the hatchet man for the CCA...A rough around the edges errand boy for Mr Jensen (Ned Beatty) who viewed this network as his big chance and that whatever worked worked ..Scruples were never an issue, and ratings were pending exchange!! Howard Beale (Peter Finch) the ""Angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our time"" surprised even himself with his charismatic clout with the naive television audience!!! He was the UBS star-lighted ""Mad Prophet of the airways""...He could arouse anger and counter-culture overzealousness just by appearing crazy!!! One speech Mr Jensen (Ned Beatty) was a bit role but incredibly powerful in his delivery of the basic concept that ideology is for sale and that television is the ultimate vehicle for manipulation!! Paddy Chayefsky is pioneer with this film as an acrimonious depiction for making world phenomena such as the fall of Communism and landing man on the moon to be minimized to a market share!!!..The terms entertainment and egalitarianism now became pejorative!!!! The movie audience is hit with the terrifying reality that a societal caprice will induce the avaricious to capitulate to human catastrophe...Give Paddy Chayefsky and Sidney Lummet credit for unveiling the revelation that ratings and the dollar take precedence over humanity!!! Howard Beale, the decrepit alcoholic, euphemistically transformed to the prescient paragon of intuitiveness, was alright so long as his innocuous chastisements did not disrupt worldwide pecuniary acquisitions!! Once they did, he was quelled, and thus deemed a total ratings chart disaster!! Ultimately, Howard Beale, the once disheveled dipsomania-cal curmudgeon, turned Messianic Savonarola, becomes the typification of the corporate guinea pig!!!!",?
19,16 February 2007,planktonrules,9, Exceptional but certainly NOT a picture you should let your kids see,"This is one of the most cynical films of all time, with a very dark and sometimes humorous look at the banality of television and the stupidity of the public. At the same time, since it's so cynical and dark, it features some exceptionally adult dialog that even today should exclude kids from watching it. Now I do understand why such rough language was used (after all, this is a harsh ""wrinkles and all"" look at television), but it's a shame really as the film COULD be an excellent civics lesson to our kids--especially teens. Watching the contempt that network programmers have for intelligence and decency is an important lesson and makes this an exceptional film.",r
20,17 January 2011,wes-connors,10, Paddy Chayefsky Gets Mad at the Media,"With his ratings in the toilet, and cancellation looming, veteran newscaster Peter Finch (as Howard Beale) decides to go out with a ""BANG!"" and announces he will commit suicide on his last broadcast. Boozy ""UBS"" network news chief William Holden (as Max Schumacher) decides to let his drinking buddy go before the camera one last time to apologize, and bow out with some dignity. Instead, Mr. Finch goes on another tirade. Of course, the ratings skyrocket, and Finch becomes a TV demagogue. Next, his popular news show is given to entertainment division executive Faye Dunaway (as Diana Christensen), who uses it to build a sensationalistic and successful schedule for the ""Network"". With uncanny direction from Sidney Lumet, ""Network"" is a bottomless pit of great performances, with Holden and Finch demonstrating the best use of vulgar language in at least a decade.",e
21,18 December 2018,mark.waltz,10," The ""1984"" of the 1970's.","Back in the mid 1970's, cable TV was a luxury. There were three networks, two forms of channels to surf (UHF and VHF), and the national news was either in print format or available through only ABC, CBS or NBC. Women anchors were few, let alone executives, so Faye Dunaway's character here (Diana Christensen) is far ahead of her time, and admittedly ""one of the boys"". Peter Finch's fictional network national news anchorman Howard Beale has been through the ringer and has been given his notice, and like ""Meet John Doe's"" Long John Willoughby, plans to kill himself. Unlike Willoughby, however, his suicide is planned to be real from his own lips, where Gary Cooper's ""Meet John Doe"" character only planned to disappear after the circulation scheme created by columnist Barbara Stanwyck passed its target date. It's the people behind the scenes in ""Network"" who pull the strings here, and instead of just newspaper owner Edward Arnold in that Frank Capra classic, you've got bigwigs from around the world it seems playing puppet master with Finch's life.

That fourth TV network is the United Broadcasting Systems or UBS for short. They are running a very poor fourth, especially in the news division.

27,25 July 2003,zetes,7, Doesn't fully fulfill its promising premise,"An interesting, ambitious, and somewhat entertaining satire of television, but one that pretty much fails for a number of reasons. It's difficult to believe almost everything that happens in it. Not one of the characters rings true. William Holden is as boring in 1976 as he was in 1955, and his cliché relationship with Faye Dunnaway is not at all believable, and not even that interesting. Their scenes together go on forever, and Holden's character carries the trite and obvious metaphor of Dunnaway as television personified, and their relationship as soap opera far further than necessary. Dunnaway herself puts an amazing amount of energy into her performance, and she didn't not deserve the Oscar she won, if you'll excuse my double negative. But her character really is only the metaphor that Holden attributes her, so what ground can she win with that? Beatrice Straight gives a performance that's most famous for being the shortest that ever won an Oscar, only three minutes. I didn't know who Beatrice Straight was, but it's obvious when she starts giving her big speech, so showy that she induced me to roll my eyes as many times as inches tall her Oscar is; that must be a record, too. Robert Duvall fares the best among the major cast members, although he hasn't much of a character either.",u
28,26 July 2001,virek213,10, Mad as hell...and great as ever!,"Much as Stanley Kubrick took a satirical aim at America's Cold War paranoia in DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, so too do Sidney Lumet and Paddy Chayefsky take a satirical aim at television in NETWORK, still one of the most pointed films ever made.  The film centers around UBS, a fourth-place TV network without a single show in the Nielsen Top 20.  Then their long-time TV newsman Howard Beale (Peter Finch), having been canned due to poor ratings, announces on the air that he is going to kill himself!  But that's not the end of it. The following night, he comes back on and apologizes, saying that he ""just run out of bulls***!"".  The ratings soar right through the roof, inspiring the two top people at UBS (Robert Duvall, Faye Dunaway) to give Finch his own show--a deal that is sealed when Finch urges his audience to open their windows and yell, ""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore!""",r

32,20 February 2020,inkblot11,10, The script is superb and ferocious while the acting is very special; don't miss it!,"UBS is the fourth network in seventies America, long before Fox. As such, Howard (Peter Finch) is the nightly news person and his ratings are trailing all of the other networks, despite his long, capable years in the business. Therefore, poor Max Schumacher (William Holden), a friend of Howard's and head of the news department, has to give his colleague the bad news. Howard is getting axed. The two go out drinking and think back on the funniest moments in their years together. But, oh, the next night is full of surprises! Howard still has two weeks to go and he announces on air he plans to kill himself on air over his firing. The network's upper bosses are aghast. But, lo and behold, everyone is interested in watching what comes next and the ratings rise. This gives calculating, career-driven Diana (Faye Dunaway) the chance to plan more new shows for the entertainment side of things. Why, terrorism will be featured on one show called the Mao Tse-Tung Hour! And her staff better come up with more insanely great ideas. The attractive but lethal Diana turns Max' head and they move in together, ruining his marriage. More importantly, Howard is such a star now that they let him continue and rant and rave on many topics. This involves the classic scene where he implores everyone to go to the window, open it, and shout ""I'm mad as h*ll and I'm not going to take it anymore!"" But, even Howard goes too far and now what will the Network do? This movie is one of the best in all of cinema world. In many respects, the ferocious and superb script by Paddy Chayefsky is responsible for its attractions as many of his biting lines are still relevant today and forever. Holden gives a conflicted, masterful performance in one of his last big roles while Dunaway won an Oscar for her extremely unlikeable but attractive turn as the Dragon Lady of television.

The writing perfect and just created a world that was utterly insane, but more real than a lot worlds created by the movie industry. The whole world of network television is just put in another light when watching this movie. I was not alive for the heyday of network news, but it had to be so much better than it is today. Watching current news programs it is exactly like watching the Howard Beale show. It was scary and sad, but still managed to be funny. Funny in an uncomfortable way. There are a lot of layers to this movie and I have only watched it once, but I am sure a lot more would be revealed as I watched it again. First of all lets comment on the acting. Top notch and I see how so many Oscars were given out. At first Faye Dunaway's performance seemed too flat, but by the end of the movie one sees why it was acted like it was and it was perfect. The perfect tragic figure that did not change and did not learn a lesson just because it was easier for her to continue her life like she always have even knowing it was wrong and would never give her happiness. Nothing needs to be said about Peter Finch's performance except wow. The next performance that stood out was Ned Beatty and his whole scene was film perfection. As he starts his speech to Beale the shot is perfectly crafted and even being such a small spot on the screen he fills and it and gives a damn memorable speech that almost evokes Emerson (maybe not in tone so much, but it was still there). As he calms down the camera moves in, but he is no less engaging. I like how they managed, perhaps by accident, able to convey the racism of the time and in the media. The fact that the movie started out as a movie about a news network and managed to turn them into terrorists and murders in such a short period of time was amazing. The directing was amazing, but with such a good script and with such quality actors it cannot be hard to make such a masterpiece. Not to belittle with Lumet did because he made the movie from the start feel flat and by the end of the movie made it perfect. the best part of the movie was the writing. Top notch writing and one of the better scripts I have encountered in a while. I am going to seek out more of his movies and see what else this guy is capable of. Overall a brilliant movie and I probably go on about how it was perfect. I am not sure I can think of a bad thing about this movie.",

41,22 November 2010,dataconflossmoor-1,10, Madness And Mayhem Have A Market Share!,"This satirical masterpiece is considered, by experts, to be one of the greatest movies ever made. This website ranks it 197 out of the top 250 movies ever created. AFI (American Film Institure) ranks ""Network"" one of the top 100 American films (#66) to ever be produced. The phrase ""I'm as mad as Hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore"" is ranked the 19th most famous quote ever, in the history of the cinema by AFI. Last, but certainly not least, the script for ""Network"" is rated as the eighth best script ever written, according to discerning critics of the Writer's Guild of America East. This last accolade is one for which I wholeheartedly concur with. Originally, the film ""Network"", was inspired by an incident which involved a possible corporate takeover of the ABC News Division back in 1970. The entire matter of a corporate takeover of a network news division initiated an outburst of creative genius from Paddy Chaefsky (The writer of ""Network"") to address the dubious repercussions of such a corporate megalomaniac's scenario. Should a corporation take over a major network's news division, the ultimate goal of huge profits would compromise the journalistic integrity of the news, as well as the news' tenacious objective for hard bitten accuracy! The film ""Network"" became a cult sensation which fascinated the movie audience. The traumas of terrorism and apocalyptic catastrophe are reduced to numbers on a conceptualization analysis chart which crossed the table of a Madison Avenue boardroom! Their degree of doom and despair is measured in terms of marketability potential! Tummultuous radicalism became relegated to the mundane process of contractual consent decree. Basically, Howard Beale was a deteriorating news anchorman for UBS whose neurotic compulsions escalated into a Nielson ratings bonanza. Within the realm of exaggeration, all occurrences in this movie were acrimoniously plausible! The unprecedented talent in ""Network"" is unbelievable. Sidney Lumet, was a director who was driven by the uncompromising efforts of New York Theatre. Peter Finch, and Faye Dunaway, were performers who had an enormous amount of theatrical experience, this was advantageous to the support of their roles in ""Network"". Other performers in this film, William Holden, and Robert Duvall, were actors who were known for their straight shooter intensity, and, their ability to cogently focus! ""Network"" was a film which depicted a bevy of left wing coups and wanted criminals to be an auspiciously cunning carnival show for caricatured reprobates. Each character in the movie had their own brand of emotions; William Holden (Max Schumaker) was always afflicted with one sordid conundrum after another,this always left him ethically challenged. His wife, (Beatrice Straight- Who won an Academy Award for best supporting actress with her character)played the part of the proverbially injured party.Peter Finch,(Howard Beale) who won the Oscar (posthumously) for best actor with this role, became an overnight pop culture icon who was perpetually agitated. Howard Beale belonged in one of three places, Bellvue, Believe it or Not, or, the third one, which wound up being his choice; Prime Time Television. Robert Duvall (Frank Hackett) was the corporate yes man who thought everything could conform to a Fortune 500 pie chart. Ned Beaty, (Arthur Jensen) was the dictatorial disciple who explained to all parties involved that euphemistic phraseology and showbiz buzz words were simplistic subterfuges which corporations used to accommodate their precarious quest for the almighty dollar. Finally, Faye Dunaway, (Diana Christensen) was the television induced purveyor for ratings popularity.. For her, corporate callousness was a by product of lucrative business decisions. Faye Dunaway's performance as Diana Christensen was perhaps the single greatest performance that I have ever seen in any movie whatsoever. A performance like this, has the potential to spoil the writers of a movie script! Such esoteric dialog that ""Network"" possessed, straddles the fence of liability which can be made or broken on a performer's delivery. Such a stellar delivery of the lines in this movie, by Faye Dunaway, could very well be perceived as a windfall of reassurance to the writers, directors and produces of this film. Suffice it to say, Faye Dunaway won for best actress in 1976 with her role in ""Network"". The single greatest attribute which an actor or actress can garner with a part, is the quality of having a totally comprehensive control of the part in which they are playing.(Prime examples of actors with this quality are Al Pacino and Kevin Spacey) Faye Dunaway's performance in ""Network"" indeed, epitomizes such a remarkable feat! The ability to detach yourself from the mechanical persona which you have assumed in a movie, cultivates a zenith in professionalism, with it, emanates an idealistic state of mind! This performer's dichotomous isolation establishes a necessary bluntness for their character, thus making it easier for that character to be effectively entertaining! Faye Dunaway's portrayal of Diana Christensen was one whereby the utterly heartfelt responses of a human being were very derivative for her, realizing that, she confined herself to her work. The fact that she was impervious to compassion, devoid of vulnerability, and ""insensitive to joy"", was what made Diana Christensen's stilted demeanor vicariously devastating to any decent individual with whom she encountered! Director, Sidney Lumet, was vehement about requiring that the character of Diana Christensen remain academically ruthless all throughout the entire film. His purpose for doing this was to see to it that she would purport an essential mass media concept which made this movie extremely powerful. This omnipotent concept advocated a sub humanoid philosophy that unfortunately establishes rudimentary ground rules for the disconcerting and virulent world of television. This film was spectacular! Why ""Network"" lost out for best picture to ""Rocky"" is very inconceivable to me! Paddy Chaefsky and Sidney Lumet were brilliant! All of the actors and actresses were magnificent!! The fact that it did not win for best picture in 1976, leaves me with only one thing to say: ""I'm as mad as Hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!!""",

The film is a stern indictment of the unscrupulous executives behind television, and also society's own obsession with mindless entertainment. Diana Christensen and Frank Hackett may very well be miserly, immoral reptiles, but it is ultimately their viewers, us, who drive their crooked dealings. Lumet delicately places the blame on his audience; we are the ""ratings"" for which the networks hunger so fanatically, and it is the crumbling state of our own culture that fuels absurd endeavours like ""The Howard Beale Show"" {thirty years on, I think we can all agree that things have only gotten worse}.",

60,29 April 2005,gnolti,9, It's All About the Characters,"There are two kinds of ""Network"" fans in the world: the Max Schumacherites and the Howard Bealists. William Holden has never looked or sounded so impressive, and there's much to be admired in his performance as the callused, romantic Max. But I happen to be in the second camp. I love Finch as an angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our times, on TV, in the florid language of a 5th Avenue bodhisattva. I can't overlook Max's tendency to roll out that tired anecdote about taking a taxi to the George Washington Bridge back in the 1950s, and what a fitting way it would be to open a memoir about the Golden Days of Television -- which is the very fate he ends up consigned to. I listen to him browbeat Diana Christensen about what a creature of TV she is, and yet can't help but cringe at how easily he slides into the role of the Unfaithful Husband (and how easily he's able to talk about that irony). All this suggests to me is that Chayefsky was unable to keep the one character he most identifies with from running away from him. Beale straddles the past and the future of television: an ""old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples"" yet who also recognizes that the medium has not begun to know its limits -- and sets out blindly to find them. (They turn out to lie somewhere between corporate America and the FCC.) As a self-referential visionary, he anticipates some of the more rabid talk-show hosts of our own time, a kind of left-wing Bill O'Reilly. Well, now that I think about it, that's not much of an accomplishment, though it's fun to watch. The tragedy of ""Network,"" I guess, is that it's Diana Christensen who's ahead of them all: she's the real Sybil the Soothsayer, and when she sees the future of television, she sees Reality TV; yet as conceived by Chayefsky, she's brilliant, beautiful, and cold as a frozen dinner.",

Posthumous Best Actor Oscar winner Peter Finch gives a harrowing performance as a TV news-anchor whose slipping sanity is used and abused by the network big-wigs; Best Actress winner Faye Dunaway is the sharp, soulless producer drowning deliriously in her work (she wants a separate life away from her job, but doesn't want to make compromises or pay any prices); Beatrice Straight won the Supporting Actress Oscar for small but solid role as William Holden's neglected wife; however, it is William Holden's work as an executive from the news division who holds the picture together, bringing it a current of sanity and logic. Holden struggles, he tries to do the right thing, he grits his teeth and covers his eyes at what he sees. Holden is positively amazing. It may be the finest performance of his long, esteemed career. ""Network"" is a wild and bumpy ride with mostly despicable people, and I laughed throughout the madness. ***1/2 from ****",

It's bitingly cynical from beginning to end - which is a perfect mirror image of U.S. society in the mid-1970's; a nation increasingly cynical, self-doubting and even depressed after years of a steady diet of Vietnam, Watergate, the energy crisis and recession. Little is missed - but the basic point of the movie is the emptiness of the television industry and the mindless and thoughtless generation the media was producing. As Howard Beale (Peter Finch) points out to his audience, everything they know they know from television, because only 3% of them read books and only 15% read newspapers. So the cynicism was a good match for the society in which the movie was made, and much of the philosophizing was bang-on and even prophetic. The performances - mainly from Finch, Faye Dunaway as the Vice President of Programming for the fictional UBS network and William Holden as the head of the news department were convincing in a satirical sort of way, meaning they're not to be taken too seriously except as caricatures of what they represent. I also loved the irony of the Communist Party and the left wing terrorist group being recruited to help with a new UBS ""terrorist of the week"" show and then being shown discussing the details of the contract they were signing. There's also the very relevant point of the news department being taken over by programming and being used for entertainment purposes rather than real news.

The story of Network still reigns true today with networks. Everybody wants high ratings and it becomes a brutal, tortured world. Peter Finch's Oscar winning role will be his most famous and one of the last. He died before getting his Academy Award. Faye Dunaway is one of the most talented actresses around and I hear she can be a bit difficult but this role is really a good role but not one of my favorites of hers. I liked her better in Bonnie and Clyde, Chinatown, and later as Joan Crawford in Mommy Dearest. I believe the Oscar was overdue. Dunaway proves that you can be both beautiful, talented, and intelligent as she does in her roles. She always leaves a lasting impression. THe film's two hours smoothly goes by.

101,11 December 2019,MuckyMuckMan73,9, A superb satirical exposé on the Manipulative world of TV,"Sidney Lumet's glorious satire about the lengths TV networks will go to obtain those elusive viewing figures is a timeless drama that is as relevant now than it was when it was made considering the political turmoil we are currently experiencing.
Peter Finch plays newscaster Howard Beale who is on the verge of a nervous breakdown after being told he will be sacked after 11yrs of working for the Network. While live on one of his final shows he dramatically tells his audience he will commit suicide on his last show. The executive board are furious and pull him screaming from his chair but viewing figures jump. Executive Diana Christensen (Faye Runaway) pursuades the board to reinstate him and viewing figures soar as his improvised angry rants resonate with the audience.
Scrutinising the lengths the scrupulous & manipulative TV company's will go for higher viewing figures Paddy Chayefsky's incredible script sizzles off his pages and on to the screen as a tour de force cast deliver his lines.
Peter Finch is superb as the crazed iconoclastic & morbid Beale, who tragically died shortly after filming but went on to win a post-humous best actor Oscar. But this isn't just a one man show, everyone involved is quite simply breath taking. Lumet always seems to get the best out of his actors and it's no different here. Brilliant performances from William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Robert Duvall and extraordinary cameos from Beatrice Straight & Ned Beatty (with two of the best scenes in the movie) make Network an outstanding piece of satirical work showing the manipulative power TV holds over the viewing public. It has to be right if the people on the TV are telling us this, right?

Muhammad Ali) learns from his less-than-forthright manager (played by Jackie Gleason) that he's no longer a viable candidate for Heavyweight Champion of the World and will thereafter find gainful employment as a professional wrestler. Mickey Rooney, playing Quinn's trainer, feels that Gleason has sold their man out, has kicked him to the curb once he's outlived his usefulness. In the closing moments of the movie, we see Quinn, done up as a caricature of an American Indian, replete with headdress and tomahawk, stomping about the ring before his wrestling debut. Just the other night, I happened across a similarly sad scene: Keith Olbermann, who had spoken Truth to Power for years as a political commentator, was once again in front of the camera (after a prolonged absence)... talking sports. Television can be the most unforgiving of mediums. With Uncle $cam once again flexing his muscles prior to The Department of Offense mopping up the floor with Syria (a tune-up bout for The Big Fight to come, with Iran) and Fukushima hemorrhaging hundreds of millions of gallons of radioactive waste into the ocean (where it'll combine nicely with the oil in the Dead Zone already 50 miles in diameter, said Dead Zone courtesy of our good friends at BP), NETWORK is once again a timely film. Islam may have its prophets, but our Military Industrial Government has ITS profits- thanks in no small measure to The Networks. In NETWORK, when Faye Dunaway suggests getting a psychic to do the news, William Holden's character sensibly suggests they hire a psychic to do the weather. Like most Televangelists, Howard Beale (Peter Finch) ""hears voices."" ""The People don't want to know the Truth,"" he learns. ""The FCC can't do anything,"" Robert Duvall says: ""We're a whorehouse network."" Aren't they all? They preach ""high moral standards,"" while appealing in the main to the lowest common denominators. TV is the electronic equivalent of comic books. The only time it's something MORE is when it speaks Truth to Power- which it hasn't done on any of the mainstream ""news shows"" for decades. ""Money makes the world go 'round,"" Ned Beatty tells Beale: ""We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies. The world is a college of corporations inexorably determined by the immutable bylaws of business. The world is a business, Mr. Beale."" That's the Holy Dominion of Dollars, folks. Beale: ""What's wrong with being an angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our times?"" Ask Keith Olbermann.",

I do mean ""emotional"" because following the characters' perspectives through the course of the film means opening yourself to a whole slew of contradictory feelings and ideas. It's certainly an effective satire of America's fascination with violence and the elusive value of truth, but at times the satirical elements clash with the thoroughly developed characters. In the end I didn't think the joke of having Beale (Peter Finch) killed by revolutionaries hired by the Network really paid off the investment I made in his character. I also feel the film is a bit too heavy-handed in its treatment of the whole concept of a ""TV generation."" It's fun to watch these actors do their work  Bill Holden was very well cast, and the contrast between Holden and Robert Duvall utilizes the parallel between Old/New Hollywood and Old/New Media. Duvall played an impressive variety of roles in the 1970s and it's hard to compare this performance to others that he gave in his career but he was suitably cold and distant as the corporate heel with no respect for objectivity in news. Holden I thought fantastic; his work here actually compares with the best work he did in his career such as for Billy Wilder in ""Sunset Boulevard."" It's very difficult to play this type of character because he's a man who thinks about everything he says and obviously chooses his words carefully  in fact this straightforward manner seems to be the key to his connection to Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway). But as an actor you can't betray a thought process with the dialog; that makes the lines feel forced. Holden does an extraordinary job in my opinion of basically bringing intellect to the character without showing us the intellect of the actor. I can't say I've ever seen him better.",

S. population as being ""part of an agenda,"" as opposed to blaming Nixon and his cronies for their own criminal wrongdoings...but I digress. Ailes and Reagan eliminated the FCC Fairness Doctrine in the final year of the Reagan Presidency in 1987, and that coupled with the Telecom Act of 1996 brought the ""news"" outlet depicted as UBS in this movie to the living rooms of every American, as part of a basic cable package.",

Would what was so shocking in 1976 really be shocking at all today? Can anything really shock us anymore? Something to think about when watching the film. Or, if you don't really want to think about things like that, you can just sit back and enjoy the film. If all you want are laughs Network works on that level too. It really is a near-perfect combination of humor and smarts. Network gives you your laughs. But it gives you a brilliant story too.",

Almost innocuously, he slips in his farewell message, but not to the network, but to the world. Meanwhile, the technical crew are oblivious, too focused on the many variables that need to be timed and executed to perfection, until someone pipes up. This might be an outrageous scenario to think of today, that a suicidal man is put back on air instead of receiving treatment, but Lumet's subdued approach means we only slowly realise what sort of world this is. Of course, the issue here is the hypocrisy of those anti-establishment outbursts while on a primetime show itself. This is sidestepped initially, because Beale is portrayed as the addled man taken advantage of by the network. Later, he becomes conscious of corporate meddling from far far above and must bring it down, until there must be an intervention.",

124,8 October 2018,Leofwine_draca,6, Arch satire,"NETWORK is one of those well-remembered '70s movies that takes a sharp swipe at the media and the exploitation of pretty much anything in a bid for ratings. It's well worth watching to see Peter Finch deliver a bombastic turn at the very end of his career, and his famous rants and speeches are undoubtedly the best thing here. Elsewhere, we get to see Faye Dunaway at her most venal, and William Holden as the stressed-out guy trying to hold everything together. I did find the execution a little bit heavy handed, some of the targets obvious, but that's because the world has moved on and become much more polarised in the 40-something years since this was released. The recent NIGHTCRAWLER is a darker version of the story, and even better in my mind.",

Actually, the movie's obvious flaw is that the aspect that is focused on, which is the political satirical one, is underdeveloped, or let's say that all small changes that happen don't make the story any better, instead, they made the satire less sharp, and made me less interested in the story.",

Sidney Lumet's Network is a movie about a fictional television network named UBS whose deranged news anchor named Howard Beale played magnificently by Peter Finch who raves about the news media for it's own profit. Of which that effects 3 major people Max Schumacher played by William Holden, Diana Christensen played by Faye Dunaway, and Frank Hackett played by Robert Duvall, and also the entire network itself. Director Sidney Lumet really made this turn out into a well done motion picture but there was just one problem while watching this movie and that was watching Faye Dunaway's overrated performance. The movie also has other great cast members besides William Holden, Faye Dunaway, and Robert Duvall, but also Ned Beatty in a great supporting performance. Another thing I really liked about this movie was the intelligent screenplay by Paddy Chayefsky who really deserved a lot of credit for the making of this motion picture achievement.",

130,27 March 2001,PIST-OFF,10, down the rabbits hole!!!!!!!!!,"Like Catch 22 before it, Network pulls you into insanity by way of showing the insanity of the sane. Moment after moment the movie gets weirder and weirder but everything seems real enough. It begs the question does life imitate art or the reverse. With all the reality shows, like Cops and Survivor, and the real world. All the shows about shows, MTV doing the history of MTV. And all the brainless action and mindnumbing stupidity on TV ie WWF, XFL, Jackass. One has to ask the question, was Network talking about television then or was it forecasting television now? The movie does have strong intones of prophecy. Furthermore there's another strong point in the movie, the dehumanization of individuals by conglomorates. This point is brought down crashingly hard hear as it is in Fight Club. First it was social groups, then the church then the nations (as in Catch 22), and now the globilization brought about by the conglomorates who preach the gosphel of the almighty dollar. The only option is suicide or the complete and total rejection of society as a whole. This movie at turns is satire, drama, propaganda, farce, surrealism, and societal commentary. It is finely portayed by all of it's actors. ""I've seen the face of god"" ""You might be right"" It is well scripted given the complexity of the subject matter. And there is a fine fine performance from Tim Robbins. But I'm left wondering about the whole William Holden/Faye Dunawaye part of the movie. Was it actually happening or was it all part of a some new reality drama for the Network? Who knows? 10 out of 10",
131,22 August 2012,JamesD2,2, Worst overacting of all time?,I absolutely hated this movie.,
132,16 March 2001,jhaggardjr,8," Strong, although over-the-top, satire","""Network"" is an extremely well-acted satire on the television industry which at times feels like it's spinning out of control. The big name cast includes Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Peter Finch, Robert Duvall, Ned Beatty, and Beatrice Straight. All give excellent performances in ""Network"", which is about a fictional TV network (UBS) that is far behind the three big TV networks in ratings (CBS, NBC, and ABC; long before Fox, UPS, and the WB networks hit the air). The executives at UBS try to do anything to get their network some good ratings, which includes giving their insane news anchorman (Finch) his own show. This is the movie where Finch says that famous line: ""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore!"" A classic line in movie history. Finch won a posthumous Best Actor Oscar for his portrayl of the crazy newsman who cracks up during his newscasts. He's good, but I think the best performance in ""Network"" is turned in by Dunaway as the heartless programming executive who comes up with some of the wildest ideas in turning UBS into a hit. When Dunaway is on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of her. She's a very strong prescene throughout this movie. She deservedly won the Best Actress Oscar for her work here. Straight (""Poltergeist""), who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this movie, gives the shortest Oscar-winning performance in film history with her 5 1/2 minute appearence as Holden's scorned wife. Another Oscar went to Paddy Chayefsky's screenplay. While ""Network"" is strongly acted most of the time, there were moments where it felt like the movie started going over-the-top. Most of the characters in this movie spend alot of time yelling and shouting at one another and after a while it got on my nerves. This doesn't happen during every frame of its two hour length, but it happens quite often. For example, Ned Beatty's big scene. He does a great job, but the scene is so laughable because Beatty goes so overboard. Duvall goes over-the-top as well in many of his scenes. But so do Dunaway, Holden, Straight, and (of course) Finch. Despite this minor setback, ""Network"" is still a very good movie.",

Righteously and correctly predicting the death of network TV, ""Network"" brings us through a TV executives' (William Holden) personal inside view of the industry's' epiphany about what it had already become and the up and coming but soulless executive (Faye Dunaway) is the seductively intuitive hustler to bring us down to the lowest common denominator. It's ugly, foul, TV drama silly, starkly funny (loved every scene with the Ecumenical Liberation Army!) and really hard not to feel a bit guilty for being mad as hell and not doing anything about it.

""Network"" is a prophecy that has been fulfilled. Adding to its air of melancholy are those fainting spells with which Beale closes his fiery sermons.

While condemned, the fallout is eventually silently accepted, and the circle of criticizing and continuing the same way as before just confirms the tragic truth behind commercialism. Ratings are paramount, entertainment at all costs, sensationalism is what the masses lust for, and individuals, who die due to exhaustion in Survivor shows or are publicly humiliated by prank calls and driven to suicide, are part of the system. All that and more was already anticipated in the brutally outspoken 1976 satire ""Network"" written brilliantly by Paddy Chayefsky and directed by grandmaster Sidney Lumet. Was the picture visionary back in the days? Actually it was a reflection on the on air suicide of an anchorwoman suffering under depression. Nothing has changed.

153,2 August 2012,aaronlromano,8, A Fierce and Searing Media Satire,"Perhaps one of the most brilliant works of satire to appear since Voltaire's Candide, this film points a damning finger at the treachery of the television industry. Faye Dunaway stars in her fabulous Oscar- winning performance as Diana, a calculating TV exec who's only concern is ratings, ratings, ratings who, without any consideration, exploits a hapless news anchor suffering from a mental breakdown. The film features a variety of other stunning performances, two of which rightfully received Oscars, as a variety of excellently painted characters. While also managing to be blackly funny, this film also shows the vastly negative effects of television on the human condition, most accurately defined in one the film's many classic lines: ""Television is not the truth! Television is a Goddamned amusement park!"" But the true brilliance of the film is the fact that in spite of the film being sternly rooted in the 70s era, it is still relevant today - perhaps even more so as corporation conglomerates continue to gobble up all that we know. But the thing to remember is: While yes it is satire and it is far more over-the-top than real life, it carries with it a striking message. It carries with it the message that television is bad, plain and simple, a fact that now more than ever we need to be reminded of. This film very well hits the mark it aims for and while it does suffer at times from being hilariously unbelievable, this too allows it to hit it's mark. In short, this is a fine film - but be careful, it may have you screaming: ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!"". My rating 8/10",

Faye Dunaway, playing a ratings-seeking programmer decides Beale's ranting and raving could draw a great audience and decides to keep him on the air, much to the anger of William Holden, playing an old producer. Holden's objections don't matter because UBS has been taken over by a greedy corporation represented by Robert DuVall.

I thought the assassination of Howard Beals at the end would be a cool way to end the film, but I was so disappointed in Sidney Lumet's execution of this scene. What should have been a great, darkly comedic finale, ended up being so cheesy. William Holden's performance was probably the most consistent of the film, but I can't understand the purpose of his character at all. As far as the story went, there was no reason for him to even be around except to give a long, drawn-out speech every once and a while. How Peter Finch and Faye Dunaway won Oscars for their performances also astounds me. The most over-acted performances of the year maybe, but Best Actor and Actress? I beg to differ. They yelled and screamed a lot, but I didn't see a lot of great acting there at all. At least this didn't win Best Picture over 'Rocky'. This is a very overrated film. ",
