0,10 March 2016,TheLittleSongbird,9, Was really surprised by how good this was,"Despite not being an auto racing fan, the stories of the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda and Lauda's accident are well known and on research was big news in the 70s. ",/
1,19 January 2014,tomgillespie2002,8, Thrilling character study,"As Asif Kapadia's gripping and extremely moving 2010 documentary Senna  proved, cinema audiences have a thirst for the larger-than-life  characters that inhabit the Formula One track. The sport itself is  frightfully dull (although I'm sure plenty will disagree with that),  but the sportsmen willing to lay down their life for a kick and a  trophy are infinitely more fascinating, especially in the days of lax  safety rules. The sport nowadays is little more than advertising on  wheels, but when the likes of James Hunt and Niki Lauda battled it out  on the track, epic rivalries were created, and no matter how talented  these men were at driving these ""coffins on wheels"", every race could  spell out death.  Rush portrays the clash of two opposing personalities. The long-haired,  dashing Englishman James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) was all about the  adrenaline, embracing the post-race parties and lying with the many  women that would throw themselves at him. He was reckless, willing to  risk his life and others in order to win, but, as described in the  film, there was no better driver in the world in terms of raw talent.  His rival, Austrian Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), was focused, clinical,  and even helped design the cars he would drive. He was the early-night  type, 'rat-faced' and cold. In every sense, he's the perfect villain.  But where Rush succeeds the most is challenging our early conceptions  of these two characters. There's little fun to be had with Lauda, but  played by Bruhl, he evolves into the underdog of the movie, perhaps the  only one that actually gives a damn about his own life and the life of  his opponents. This, naturally, leads to tragedy and a particularly  wince-inducing scene in which Lauda requires having his lungs vacuumed,  but it's at this point that we realise just what these two drivers mean  to each other. As Lauda watches Hunt claw back some points in the 1976  Formula One season, it becomes clear that these two need each other to  survive. Their hatred of one another only serves to fuel the flames,  and leads to Lauda's defiant early return to the driver's seat, scarred  and bandaged.  Fast cars, beautiful women and exotic locations hardly sounds like a  recognisable workload for Ron Howard, one of the most play-it-easy  directors out there. His past films have been unjustifiably successful,  critically and commercially, never stamping a recognisable directorial  trait onto his work. Yet here, although the bright sheen of the 70's  initially takes some getting used to, he has managed to create a world  that is very much alive, using snappy editing, a pumping soundtrack and  some growing sound design to re-create this world for petrol-heads. But  he doesn't neglect his characters, and evokes the great work done on  Frost/Nixon (2008), which was also a study of two giant, clashing  personalities coming together on the world stage.  Rush is an exhilarating experience, able to distinguish each race from  the next and literally putting us in the driver's seat with the use of  digital cameras. Although it occasionally drifts into formulaic  territory with the introduction of the 'wives' (played by Oivia Wilde  and Alexandra Maria Lara, respectively), Howard cleverly uses this as  an insight into Hunt and Lauda's personalities. Hemsworth is very good  in his first 'proper' post-Thor role, but it is Bruhl that you take  away from the film. How he gets you to initially loath him, only to be  cheering him on at the climax is the work of a great actor, and it's a  crime that he has been snubbed by the Academy this year. Hopefully this  will inspire a host of decent sports movies, as Rush proves that you  can mix character study and even existential musings with the thrill of  sport.",r

8,11 October 2013,Horst_In_Translation,8, No better script than reality,"Originally I planned on not watching ""Rush"" at the theater, simply because I lost interest into Formula 1 considerably since the Schumacher years. However, finally curiosity got the better of me and I decided to give it a go. Which proved a pretty great choice as Ron Howard's latest movie makes for a very entertaining two hours. I was vaguely aware of the year season 1976, the developments and outcome of the driver championship and Lauda's spectacular crash of course as you get pretty much reminded here every second weekend when you see him being the co-host of current Formula One coverage. Putting Daniel Brühl into perspective to what I see there, I think he nailed Lauda's character and his very own Viennese charm. Of course, it's different to compare with Lauda now being roughly 35 years older than in the movie and I was not even born the year Lauda ended his career, but I think he made a good job in portraying him. Aside from all comparisons to what Lauda was really like, he definitely created an interesting character that had your eyes glued to the screen during every scene he was in. It's not surprising Brühl is in talks for his first Oscar nomination and it's nice to see him back so strongly, after I was a bit disappointed by his work in recent years, especially in ""Inglourious Basterds"" where his performance wouldn't make my top5 of the film despite having a pretty interesting character.",r
9,18 March 2014,Vartiainen,9, Way more than just a Formula 1 sports film,"I liked this film a lot more than I would have anticipated. Sure I knew going in that the two main leads were both brilliant actors - Hemsworth especially has become a recent favourite of mine - but they both exceeded my wildest expectations. They became James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl), down to the smallest of detail, the most delicate of nuance. The 1976 racing season was before my time, but even though I'm just a casual Formula 1 fan, I had heard about it and I knew who these two were. They were such large characters, such giants in their chosen field, that had this film not captured them perfectly, it wouldn't have been half as good as it is now. Luckily Howard's directing and the performances of these two are some of the finest I've seen in a long time.",w

11,5 September 2013,TheSquiss,8," A dazzling story of F1, rivalry, respect & cheating death.",Those who have seen the trailer will know that Rush is the 'Formula 1 film'. The presence of Ron Howard's and Chris Hemsworth's names above the title may put some bums on seats but the fact of it being a film about motor racing will undoubtedly ostracize some potential viewers.,8

The tracks are complex, the opportunities to pass are limited and the pit stops must be carefully timed. But this movie isn't current F1 racing, this movie largely takes place in the late 1960s till the mid 1970s where it was far more dangerous and that much more invigorating because of it. We get a classic storyline of two rivals with two very different styles, they had to respect each other due to the sheer magnificence of their driving.",8

18,16 February 2014,Bob-45,10, Precision craftsmanship,"When my wife and I first saw the US trailer for ""Rush,"" my wife asked me, ""Do you want to see it?"" ""Well, it IS a 'racing movie,"" I replied. I have mixed emotions about NOT watching the international trailer, before watching ""Rush,"" because I would certainly have held much higher expectations. First and foremost, ""Rush"" is NOT about Chris Hemsworth's pecs; nor, for that matter, is it that much about about Chris Hemworth's character, James Hunt. ""Rush"" is about two extraordinary men's visions of life and their approaches to racing; and, it is viewed from James Hunt's most famous challenger, Nicki Lauder. Lauder is a technocrat; a man who, at least, appears to ""know the price of everything and the value of nothing."" Hunt is free spirit; one of simultaneously knows the value of everything and nothing. Hunt and Lauder are presented in much the same manner as the two main characters of ""Lonesome Dove"". Like, ""Lonesome Dove,"" ""Rush"" is majestic in its presentation of these two lives. ""Rush"" is poetic in its presentation, absolute precision,from its score, to its cinematography, to its performances to the most both memorable and appropriate score I have heard since ""The Good, The Bad & The Ugly"".",?
19,7 September 2013,tj_seabrook,10, Superb all round,Having seen the trailers and TV set-up (BBC as a Grand Prix insert) I was thinking OK so I've probably seen the best of this and it's going to be 'clunky' in parts or too far up it's own a$$.,r

22,2 June 2014,kosmasp,9, More than fast cars,"I have to admit, I never thought I'd be really convinced by this movie. I don't really have a keen interest in the Formula and only really know Lauda, but even his story was not one that I could recite or anything. It might have helped or not, but I can say, that this drama is more than just a movie about two fast drivers.",_
23,1 October 2013,insessionfilm,10, Rush brings intense racing action,"DIRECTION Ron Howard is amazing. His camera work here is absolutely incredible. I wouldn't at all be surprised if the cinematography and the sound editing are nominated for Oscars. The engines roaring alongside Hans Zimmer's score really gets you into the mood. The backdrop is gritty with lots of dark and gray colors giving it a tough 1970′s aesthetic. Howard places is camera so specifically and we get so many different angles that are gripping. Camera work inside the cars giving you the intense look of driving an F1 car as well as camera's on the grass looking up as they fly by. Howard's use of slow motion is also perfect and helps build the intensity of the rivalry he is exploring here. The racing is intense and the dangers are shown in some dramatic ways as the suspense keeps building up. The biggest problem is that Formula 1 isn't the biggest of sports here in the U.S. If people can get past that and go see this, they won't regret it.",=
24,1 October 2013,JackCerf,7, Everything It Should Be,"After a short framing section, this starts off with a bloody-mouthed Chris Hemsworth in half-undone racing coveralls strutting into an emergency room on a wave of testosterone like a cock into a hen house. Every female head in the place turns, and a glaze of lust falls across nurse Natalie Dormer's face. Within a minute and 4 lines of dialogue, he and she are doing the horizontal mambo on the examining table and, through a series of quick cuts, plenty of other places. In short, it looks like we're going to get a 16 year old boy's dream of being a race car driver.",t
25,13 February 2023,RonellSowes,8, One Of The Best Of The Decade,"I think almost everyone who sees this movie has the same reaction to it. Which is something along the lines of, ""I dont like racing but this was great"". Or words to that effect. And it's true you don't have to be a fan of Grand Prix or familiar with Nikki Lauda or James Hunt to appreciate this film. It's simply proof that a good story/movie can exist in any genre or subject. Though I think even the most distant auto racing fans will find Howard's race sequences exhilarating, they're not the focus of the movie nor what makes it great. It's a character story examining the racers and they're rivalry. Daniel Bruhl's portrayal as such a fascinating (and likable) character Lauda is what drives this film but Hemsworth's Hunt is the perfect contrast to him. Just as in real life the absolutely contrasting figures elevate and play off each other beautifully in what made great races and a great film. From Howard, Morgan through Bruhl, Hemsworth, Zimmer and many more, Rush is excellence.",t

27,14 April 2015,Theo Robertson,8, I'm Puzzled Why The Oscars Ignored This,I remember seeing the trailers for RUSH when it was just about to hit the cinemas in the early Autumn of 2013 and thinking it was going to be a major contender for the Oscars . This is the type of movie the Academy Awards love in theory . True life story with actors playing true life people and at the heart of the story rivalry where men risk their lives to show they're better than their rival . On top of that from what you're able to glean from the trailers this is a very proficient film from a technical point of view and I had this down as walking off with the Oscar for editing and sound . Therefore I was totally shocked that the film did not receive a single nomination when the nominations were revealed at the start of 2014 . True 2013 was an exceptional year for films but after finally getting round to watching RUSH I'm still at a loss why it didn't pick up more awards and nominations ,u
28,22 June 2015,Leofwine_draca,6, An interesting story wins out over average film-making,"RUSH is a film which tells the true-life tale of the rivalry between F1 drivers Niki Lauda and James Hunt during the 1970s. It's a film which explores what makes the two men tick in terms of their personal lives, but it also looks at the world of racing back in the 1970s, which was definitely a more dangerous time to be a racing driver.",r

30,21 March 2019,mgd_m,7, Underrated,"I was quite surprised by this movie. The ratings are good, but I don't like Ron Howard and I thought it was the usual, hollow overdramatization of actual events. Instead, it's a very nice movie, fairly accurate, and a must-see for any racing enthusiast.",
31,25 September 2013,Winduct,7, More than just a film about cars.,"''Rush'' is a very good film about the rivalry between two Formula 1 race car drivers and their lives behind it. Directed by Ron Howard, the film is a triumph concerning action sequences, film editing and sound. Despite it being a sports film about racing, ''Rush'' never fails to develop its characters, its story and its suspense thus delivering a deeply satisfying conclusion.",

33,13 February 2014,JamesHitchcock,7, Very good true-life sporting drama,"There was a time during my boyhood in the sixties and seventies when I took a keen interest in Formula One racing, but my enthusiasm quickly disappeared when I realised what an appallingly dangerous sport it was; during this period several of my heroes were either killed (Jim Clark, Bruce McLaren, Piers Courage, Jochen Rindt, Peter Revson) or seriously injured (Stirling Moss, Graham Hill). Despite my disillusionment, however, even I could not fail to be captured by the rivalry between James Hunt of Britain and Niki Lauda of Austria in the 1976 season. ",
34,9 September 2013,ishan_vadera,9, Surprisingly Great movie!!,"RUSH is such an enthralling movie!! Amazing direction by Ron Howard, strong performances by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl (he exactly sounded like Niki Lauda). Hanz Zimmer is the man for scoring this movie. The movie is not about the sport, it's about the hateful and envious relationship between two rivals the whole world knows about. I did not expect this movie to surprise me so much as it did, the drama was invigorating and exciting at the same time. It was such an honor to meet Niki Lauda who flew himself specially from Monza, Italy for the premier at TIFF. Such an amazing night.",
35,31 December 2013,face-819-933726,9, Everything is as real as it can be without being just a memory.,"You will come away from this knowing more about Formula racing than you ever expected to. They captured the Seventies perfectly in this movie once again. They had made a movie similar to this years ago, and it is funny how the window that Ron Howard has created here actually feel like it is opening to that time perfectly. It is truly impressive how well they were able to give you the feeling of speed, and put you in the drivers seat. There is no fear of motion sickness for you though as the action is all slowed down to a pace that your stomach will be able to handle. The acting is all top notch, and very real, Having the whole story be told from Lauda's perspective gives the whole thing so much more humanity than it would have had from the perspective of James Hunt who only wanted to win, but had no real reason for wanting it. I recommend this movie to anyone, I Enjoyed it quite a bit, and you will too. The action is just enough to not outweigh the very well told, and visually perfect story.",
36,7 April 2014,drqshadow-reviews,9, Everyone is Driven By Something,"White-knuckle racing with tons of heart and a raging fire in the pit of its stomach. Like the similarly adrenaline-drenched ""Warrior"" before it, Rush does an excellent job of evenly pursuing its dual leads, examining both to such lengths that we have ample reason to pull for each in their climactic showdown. Directly inspired by the real men behind the story, its depiction of both personalities, warts and all, is masterful. Ron Howard's always known which strings to tug for maximum emotional impact in his work, but that usually comes at a price: simple, one-dimensional caricatures at the helm. Rush represents an evolution for the director; he no longer shies away from the darker, less desirable elements of his leading man/men, and that strong investment in their development pays dividends at the climax. The pulse-pounding F-1 scenes are gripping and intense - I'd expect no less from today's bombastic Hollywood effects departments - but the real attraction is the race that goes on away from the track, as two dedicated drivers break themselves in half to one-up a lifelong rival. An excellent, impressive blend of moods that touches many nerves.",
37,23 August 2020,andrewchristianjr,8, INTENSE.,"Intense. This film truly takes you for a ride. Fast-paced and highly entertaining from the starting line. Even if you're not an F1 fan, you would still enjoy this.",
38,11 February 2014,utgard14,5, When was the bar lowered?,"Not bad but terribly overrated drama. Seems like these days every movie that is halfway good is over-hyped and hailed as a masterpiece. I don't know when it happened but at some point in the last decade or so the bar was lowered. Now every moderately good film is lumped in with the greatest of all time. I'm no racing fan but I have enjoyed racing films before. Rush is overlong and doesn't build to anything really. The ending, or more to the point the last half hour, felt like a story searching for a powerful finish that it never found. I know this is based on real people and events, but I fail to see how that matters in the context of judging how they told the story. A dramatic film is not a documentary and artistic license is acceptable and, in many cases, desperately needed. What it comes down to is that this is a middle-of-the-road drama. Nothing exceptional and certainly nothing new. The performances are adequate, but nothing to rave about. The story, real or not, is fractured and lacking in any sense of a point in the end. I felt like I learned nothing of significance about the two men that the film focuses on. This is particularly true for James Hunt, portrayed by Chris Hemsworth. Other than being a walking cliché, what else was there to the man? The film has no answers. It has few more for Daniel Bruhl's Niki Lauda. Perhaps if they had chosen to focus on just one of the men rather than both, they could have told a more interesting story. As it is, it's a superficial drama about two men with unimpressive racing footage sprinkled throughout.",
39,2 November 2013,matthewssilverhammer,5," Stylish but lacks a real emotional connectionother than racing scenes, movie lacks urgency","Ron Howard is the rare Hollywood auteur that doesn't have a distinctive style (how did the guy that gave us ""Frost /Nixon"" give us Jim Carrey's ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas""?!). In his latest film ""Rush"", we get a glimpse of Howard playing with some Danny Boyle-esque flair, especially in the racing scenes. Unfortunately, outside of this visceral, kinetic spirit, ""Rush"" lacks an emotional connection with its audience, leaving us in the dust with only a memory of what just sped past. The amazing true story about the on-and-off-the-track rivalry of racers James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Bruhl) should be ripe pickings for good filmmaking. The story has some unexpected turns that are enlivened by their being true. Add to that some decent performances and a strong middle section involving a hospital, this should be a no-brainer success. Sadly the film fails in a number of other ways: the dialogue, while not bad, is unoriginal and boring, clichéd and overly-Hollywood. This along with some silly, overwrought Hollywood moments (""We may hate each other, but at least we respect each other"") hurt ""Rush"" immensely. Admittedly, I am not a racing fan of any kind, and this is clearly a movie made for them. Nonetheless, I think Howard is trying to reach beyond this demographic but comes up short. ""Rush"" is by no means a complete failure, but when it steps away from the formula 1 racing and slows down, it really putters outpun totally intended.",
40,5 April 2014,Fluke_Skywalker,7, 'Rush' is a well oiled machine,"Like many Americans, I know next to nothing about open-wheel/Formula-1 racing beyond the Indianapolis 500, so names like James Hunt and Niki Lauda meant nothing to me up until a few days ago. In many ways, I wonder if that wasn't to my advantage going into Ron Howard's 'Rush', a sleek, well tuned film that focuses on the brief, but intense rivalry between these two very different men.",
41,5 October 2013,Sergeant_Tibbs,6, Slick and sexy if flawed. Howard's best work yet.,"Rush has my personal distinction of being the first film I've seen after reading the script. Why did I do that? Mostly curiosity of how a film like this is written. I want to be a screenwriter so I wanted to see how it's done, especially those races. It's not the only film of the next four months that I've read nor the first of the bunch. I read upcoming films because reading scripts of films I know can be distracting trying to picture them for myself and unproduced scripts are most likely unproduced for a reason. Upcoming films means I have seen glimpses of them from the trailer but not too much and they're considered good enough to be produced right now. I wouldn't read a potential favourite but I'm still generally excited for the big films of the year. Anyway, it had to be said as it did affect my viewing experience, but it was certainly not a hindrance. It was only a hindrance for differentiating the film and script between the few scenes cut and added but there are only few and mostly for the better.",

The film is based on the true story of a great sporting rivalry between handsome English playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth), and his methodical, brilliant opponent, Austrian driver Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl). The story follows their distinctly different personal styles on and off the track, their loves and the astonishing 1976 season in which both drivers were willing to risk everything to become world champion in a sport with no margin for error: if you make a mistake, you die.

45,26 September 2013,jmoney-2,8, Rocky vs. Rocky. The audience wins.,"Most sports movies involve an underdog trying to defeat an established champion. We've seen a million variations of Rocky Balboa taking on Apollo Creed. But what if someone made a film about Rocky fighting another Rocky? That's what director Ron Howard has done with his excellent new racing movie, ""Rush."" The most compelling aspect of this tale of two long shots is that it's not the invention of a screenwriter. It actually happened. The drama centers on the rivalry between two drivers, James Hunt and Niki Lauda, and the movie follows each man's unlikely rise to the top ranks of the Formula One circuit. The heart of the action takes place during the dramatic 1976-racing season during which the British Hunt and the Austrian Lauda vied for the world championship. They both overcame enormous adversity and risked their lives for the chance to win it all. Danger is a major theme hovering over the story, as the potential for death lurks around every turn of track. In this era of racing, an average of two drivers were killed each year.",
46,29 September 2013,zetes,9, Exhilarating,"Chris Hemsworth stars as James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl (whom you may remember as the lovestruck Nazi soldier in Inglourious Basterds) as Niki Lauda, two Formula 1 race car drivers in the 1970s who had a fierce rivalry. It's the classic clash of psychologies setup: Hemsworth is a fun-loving womanizer who races for the thrill, while Bruhl is the strict disciplinarian. There's nothing really surprising or deep about this movie, but, my lord, is it excellent. It's just a great example of straightforward, Hollywood filmmaking, perfectly put together in every way. The racing scenes are exhilarating, but it's really the great lead performances that impress the most. You almost have to hate Hemsworth. How can anyone be as handsome as he is and as good an actor? Bruhl gave perhaps the most undervalued performance in Inglourious Basterds, and this movie proves he ought to be a huge star.",
47,3 October 2013,edwardrevans,10, Wow I don't watch F1,"So watching this as a neutral I was simply blown away by how good a genre film this is better than Senna to say. Beautifully shot and in good old 2D is I can't say its 100% true to real life events but boy its sure seems like it to me. Unusually its shot from both points of view that been Hunt and Lauda as each are given equal screen time. The Two lead actors are well cast and convincing even the makeup for Lauda's facial injuries are near perfect, it just goes to show that when Ron Howard when he's on top of his game what he can give to the screen.",
48,23 October 2013,Robert_duder,9, I eat my humble pie Mr. Howard...my apologies,"You may wonder what the title of my review means? I think Ron Howard is a brilliant director obviously. However, when I first saw trailers for Rush it did nothing for me. I sort of turned up my nose and thought this was pretty low on the Ron Howard totem pole. I will see pretty much anything in theatres and yet I had no desire to go see this one. For one reason or another that I won't bore you with I ended up at Rush on a cheap night at the theatre. I should have put more faith in Mr. Howard. This was an incredible film. The acting was first rate (Oscar worthy even?) the story was terrific, the action riveting and being based on a true story made it all the more fascinating as it covers what sounds like one of the greatest sports rivalries in history that I had never even heard of. I am not a racing fan, I have never even sat down to see more than ten seconds of a car race and yet this story could impress anyone. This is about two larger than life characters that have this rivalry that leads to this incredible level of respect between them. At times it had a little bit of a Rocky feel to it as many sports films do but it was all around and excellent and very entertaining experience.",

It shows how Lauda's discipline gives him an edge over his rival but also how Hunt's likability and sometimes cunning ways evens this score! All in a riveting movie which will keep you glued to your screen till the end. everyone of us will relate to one of the two opposing characters in the movie, and will probably be rooting for your guy to come out tops.. the danger in the races will keep you on toes throughout, remember this is from a true story and things do get awry in true stories..",

Lol) because of the 2019 hype of 'ford vs Ferrari', I felt compelled to watch that film, and this one too. It says a lot I couldn't finish 'ford vs Ferrari' but this one grabbed me immediately and didn't let go until it had me in tears. This film really proved Hemsworth as a good actor, and Brühl, who I've been a fan of a long time, an even better one. It's infuriating to me to find out only now Bruhl was nominated for practically every single award except the oscar. My only consolation is this is considered an industry travesty. Looking up the 2014 oscar year, it was inundated by 'Dallas buyers club', so no surprise there this film would be snubbed. It wasn't political enough. I'm also not saying Hemsworth deserved the oscar over mccaunghey, but Brühl definitely deserved it over Leto. C'est la vie.

The pistons firing, gears turning, and constantly changing camera angles made the scenes very captivating. Chris Hemsworth did a solid job as Hunt, but I think that Bruhl stole the show in his role as Lauda. The mannerisms and speaking style with the overbite made him the more enthralling character over Chris's Hunt. Olivia Wilde plays a minor role with a very convincing British accent in her limited screen time. This is an excellent movie for both racing fans, and non-racing fans alike.",

Although the bad blood aspect of this film might not be real. There is just way more tension if you don't do research on the outcome, before watching this movie.

66,6 October 2013,kluseba,9, Incredibly intense and recommendable for everybody,"""Rush"" is definitely one of the best movies of the year and has many strong points to offer - even to those who aren't into motor sports at all. First of all, the acting is simply incredible. Chris Hemsworth performs the slowly dying kind of charming and charismatic pop stars among athletes that doesn't exist anymore in modern motor sports. He portrays a self-confident daredevil, playboy and sex symbol who seems superficial and unsympathetic at first sight but who turns out to be courageous and have more values than one might think. Behind his arrogant appearance is a breakable young man destined to live in the fast lane and die young. Many real persons from that time and especially the real Niki Lauda said that Chris Hemsworth acts and speaks exactly as the real James Hunt did which proves his incredible acting job. His antagonist is portrayed by Daniel Brühl who incarnates a young and motivated man who seems to be an arrogant and bourgeois nouveau riche at first sight but who turns out to be as breakable, courageous and determined as his concurrent. The two main characters are very different from each other but at the same time they have enough things in common to be at eye level during the most exciting Formula One season in history. I think that Daniel Brühl's acting is even better. He had to incarnate a real person that is still alive which is always tough. As a German he had to learn an Austrian accent to speak German and English in a credible way, he had to have the same gestures and he had to incarnate the same temperaments the real Niki Lauda. Thanks to a lot of details and time put into this acting job and many meetings with the real Niki Lauda, Daniel Brühl perfectly succeeded and delivers without the glimpse of a doubt the best acting performance of his career. The thing that impressed me the most was that the real Niki Lauda said that he thought of people being cruel and superficial when they have watched him with disgust or scare after his accident but when he watched this movie he had the same terrified reaction and finally understood why I all people had reacted that way so many years ago. His reaction proves how intense and real this movie is even though a few historical facts are of course exaggerated to put additional tension into this film. Next to the incredibly gifted two main actors who almost have the same screening time and are equally treated in depth even though the story is told by the film character Niki Lauda, one should not forget about a whole bunch of great supporting actors in this movie. There is simply no bad actor or actress in this film.",

With phenomenal storytelling, prefect direction and near flawless acting, it submerses the audience into a the F-1 Racing world circa 1976. The film showcases the bitter rivalry of James Hunt and Niki Lauda, the most memorable of the sport. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl were near perfect in this film, due to the fact that the audience is meant to view these people as both protagonists. It delves into the morality of both characters, not showing one or the other as a villain or a hero, just regular and ordinary. With the help of Ron Howard's direction, this film elevates the intensity of this rivalry with getting riveting performances from the entire cast all around the board. However, the real shining star of this film is Daniel Brühl. Brühl gives the performance of his career in this film. And I fully expect an Oscar nomination for him this year.",
69,7 November 2017,classicsoncall,7," ""Just give me the drive!""","Not being a racing fan, what intrigued me about the story was the head game rivalry between Formula 1 drivers Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) and James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth). The film begins with Lauda's narration, so one assumes from the outset that he would be the principal character, but the picture is pretty even handed in it's treatment of both men. Diametrically opposed in both temperament and style, Lauda comes across almost boorish in his approach to racing, while Hunt represents the playboy sportsman looking to score with women virtually every moment he's not on the track. As far as that goes, the film probably overdid it in that regard, especially when an injured Hunt with his guts practically hanging out decides to have a fling with a hospital nurse. With all the name calling, middle finger waving and salty language between the two men, I wasn't left disappointed as the story was winding down, in as much as Hunt came to respect his rival as a worthy opponent on the race track. It appeared to go both ways actually, even as one or the other had to accept inevitable defeat from one race to the next. As far as the race footage itself, exciting enough I guess for fans who go for it. For this viewer it was an incidental part of the story.",

It was massive, and it was heavy. The Nürburgring is not just dangerous, it wrecks cars with its dips and rolls.

In fact, with some adept writing by Peter Morgan ('The Queen', 'Frost/Nixon'), we travel in time to witness the events that lead up to the Formula 1 World Championship of 1976 and the formation of an unparallelled rivalry. Back then, racing wasn't as safe as it now is. It was rather an era when recklessness and flamboyance brought glory to some racers while two of the others on the grid, died every year. In the midst of this, are two men driven by danger; two rivals driven by passion; two legends driven by each other. Ron Howard is renowned for having a keen sense of the idiosyncrasies of his protagonists and here too, he depicts the influence of their personal lifestyles that shaped their racing styles. But where he really excels, is with the rivalry on track. The sheer thrill, excitement and dangers of Formula 1 racing are brilliantly captured as we travel the globe through stormy wet weather with cars screaming across the screen at 170 mph. ",

76,7 September 2014,Scarecrow-88,9, Rush,"Ron Howard delivers an adrenaline-high, well-paced, expertly photographed ode to 70s Grand Prix racing, following the thrilling rivalry between calculating, brilliant, but cold and not-quite-ingratiating Austrian, Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) and party-hearty, womanizing, handsome buck, James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth). The dueling egos, bravado, swapped barbs rippling with honesty, and incredible talent of both men makes for some high drama. Every cinematic trick (the ways Howard shoots the cars during races and reactions towards all the key dramatic moments, such as Lauda's tormented near-death experience thanks to burns from his car's fire consumption and agonizing hospital recovery and the rainy Japanese final formula race that Hunt narrowly survives to win the world championship) Howard uses to create a marvel of visual power. I think the racing is what many will come to this film for, and that will not disappoint. There's also a pretty damn good story here, too. It's a biopic about racing legends who drove each other to be as good as they could be. Howard knows how to recreate history on film and he carefully avoids the pratfalls that could belie a 70s biopic through cunning editing and avoiding taking Rush away from the track too much. Both leads match their real-life personas, not only looking like them but providing gravitas to these characters to give them dimension. I love fast cars and them racing in competition tugs at my testosterone. Rush would fit perfectly in a double feature with John Frankenheimer's Grand Prix (1966). The rehab and return to racing after the burning for Niki is absolutely harrowing. There's no doubt that Hemsworth is a stud and has the right charisma to portray such a larger-than-life person as James Hunt. Niki's courage and guts after such suffering is quite astonishing. I personally consider Howard's Rush superior filmmaking.",

A gripping drama based on the real-life rivalry between Formula One adversaries James Hunt and Niki Lauda that culminated in their history-making bout for the 1976 world championship title, it has the very rare honour of being a sports movie not just for fans of the sport itself, but a celebration of a universal need within every individual for purpose and achievement.",
78,6 October 2013,zardoz-13,8, Good Race Car Epic,"In ""Rush,"" Oscar-winning helmer Ron Howard returns to the subject matter that he cut his teeth on as a film director: fast cars. In 1977, Howard made his directorial debut with the hilarious manhunt comedy ""Grand Thief Auto"" (1977) for executive producer Roger Corman about characters careening around in cars. Like ""Grand Theft Auto,"" ""Rush"" focuses on fast cars. Unlike ""Grand Theft Auto,"" where amateurs did the driving, skilled professionals are behind the wheels in ""Rush."" Not only do they travel at higher speeds, but they also tread more treacherous roads. This polished but predictable saga has to do with the historic rivalry between Formula One British speedster James Hunt and Austrian automotive genius Niki Lauda. ""Rush"" spends most of its leisurely 123 minutes on its protagonists and their clashes rather than the experience of hurling along European thoroughfares at homicidal speeds in the equivalent of bobsleds on wheels with rocket fuel. Aussie-born Chris Hemsworth of ""Thor"" has been cast appropriately enough as Hunt, while Spanish actor Daniel Brühl impersonates Niki Lauda. Historically, Lauda and Hunt jostled each other for the top position during the 1976 Grand Prix racing season. Ron Howard keeps the soap opera scenes with the love interests of both racers to a minimum so as to maintain momentum over the long haul. Consequently, Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara look dazzling but have little to say. Ultimately, these two competitors would come to realize that their ruthless rivalry enhanced their racetrack performance. An enduring, universal, life-truth lurks beneath all the scenic cities, challenging racetracks, and the charismatic performers in ""Rush.""

Yet the subplots of personal styles take a backdrop to the thrilling scenes of the heart pounding races the two have against each other on international tracks. This film really did a good job with it's recreation of telling the 1970's world of formula one racing which had a rivalry that not many people knew about.

You might think that a dramatic reconstruction of their careers might not seem very appealing; but you might also remember that the documentary 'Senna', about another talented, spoilt and arrogant young racer was actually quite compelling. Unfortunately, Ron Howard's 'Rush' takes a simplistic approach to representing both the character of the two men and also the intricacies of racing, sometimes combining idiocies in both departments simultaneously (in the first race we see, Hunt is beating Lauda to some championship - the cumulation of a season's racing - without apparently even knowing who he is). You won't learn much about motor racing from this film, nor what makes a good driver, nor even much about the two men's characters beyond a tabloid characterisation.

Year after year decade after decade he just keeps churning out quality. Although much more subtle and restrained than for example Cinderella Man (two adjectives you never thought you would see in a review of a racing film) this production is never less than hypnotic and viewer interest never wanes, not for a single frame. And a great story too -- some 30 years after the incredible Amadeus we have yet another rivalry for the history books. Hemsworth actually gets to speak entire sentences when he is away from Asguard, and, who knew, he is a very competent actor. Daniel Brühl is superb, especially considering his character is repeatedly described in the script as looking like a rat, and Bruhl has to compensate with raw unfiltered self-esteem, and pulls it off. Olivia Wilde is a treasure here -- it's not just the hair and makeup, it's like someone took her aside and told her that, unless she could find her inner Candice Bergin, her career playing tart after tart might just be over. For her first few scenes, she is almost unrecognizable, and she manages that feat by sheer force of will. Ironically, considering the theme, the finish is a tad weaker than the opening.

95,9 August 2014,lesleyharris30,9," Great Biography thats Interesting Whether or Not You're Interested in Formula One Racing,","Rush is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a great cast.I wasn't very interested in watching this movie,a lot of my friends were recommending it to me but they were all people that are big F1 fans,which I am not,but I decided to rent it and didn't regret it one bit,you don't have to be interested in Formula One racing to enjoy this movie,we get to see a lot of Niki Lauda and James Hunts personal life and see how they made it in to the business and later on we follow their rivalry,it is a interesting biography film.The acting is very good,Daniel Brühl and Chris Hemsworth delivered great performances,I particularly enjoyed Brühl,I haven't seen him in anything other than this and Inglorious Basterds,but I am impressed with his acting skills and hope to see more of him in the future,I was also very impressed by Olivia Wilde,when I heard she was English in this movie I didn't think she could pull it off,but she did a great job and I would have liked to have seen more of her in this.Certainly not a clichéd racing film,Rush is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good biography film or drama.

96,14 November 2014,brchthethird,10, A bold and exhilarating sports drama,"I don't particularly gravitate towards sports movies, primarily because I'm just not into sports but also because a lot of them are cliché-ridden underdog stories that have been done to death. Not so with RUSH. In what is the best film that Ron Howard has done in years, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl give excellent performances as James Hunt and Niki Lauda: Formula One drivers whose rivalry gave each other purpose and motivation to succeed. As personalities, they couldn't have been more different. James Hunt was brash, more of a ladies' man and reveled in the fame that being a race car driver afforded. Niki Lauda was more cold, calculating and concerned with the technical aspects of racing, and he could also be quite blunt. What I liked about this movie, aside from the racing aspect, was the examination of these two polar opposite personalities and the way in which they pushed each other forward. There is plenty of screen time allotted to establishing their characters, and once they meet, sparks fly. I thought both Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl did an excellent job in portraying these two men, and made it seem very believable. Of course, this is a racing movie, so the other question would be how that aspect stacks up. No lie, this movie had some of the best, and most thrilling racing sequences I've seen. Ever. Apparently, they had actual drivers (and the actors) drive Formula One cars at high speeds and attached cameras to the outside to capture the feel of what it would be like to be in one of those cars. It was really exhilarating stuff, and it's a pity that I wasn't able to catch this in theaters when it first came out. I also should mention the incredible score by Hans Zimmer, who is quickly becoming one of my favorite film composers. He created an epic feel, not unlike what he did with Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. Still, it was distinct from that iconic score and added a lot to the overall feel of the film. There was also a good selection of 1970's classic rock. Overall, there's not a thing I can think of that's even a little wrong with this film. Every aspect of it perfectly displays the skills of the talent involved, and the central story elevates it above your typical sports drama. Even if sports movies aren't your thing, you'd be remiss for not giving this one a try.",
97,13 January 2014,Reno-Rangan,10, I saw the best ever Hemsworth,"Ron Howard, the master of biographical picture maker. As I know of him, he never failed to transform biographical stories into a movie. In fact, many of his movies are my favourites. This time he picked up a true story of two rivalry formula 1 drivers from the 70s. This biographical sports drama was nothing short in all the aspects compared to his earlier movies. So his legacy continues with a series of masterpieces in his filmography. I am always fond of his works because the mix of sentiments in his movies is powerfully appealing just like I wanted. The emotion tool was very wisely utilized in this movie as well.",
98,2 February 2014,leonblackwood,7, Great intense drama. 7/10,"Review: This movie was made extremely well by Ron Howard and the actors done a great job portraying the rivalry between Lauda and Hunt. The only problem that I found with the movie was that none of there personal stories were seen through. Hunt seemed to jump from one girl to the other and Lauda seemed to keep his personal life secret so there true personalities came out when they were racing. The scenes on the track were very realistic and they brought some intensity to the movie. I also liked the fact that you actually see the real drivers at the end of the movie. Anyway, this movie is definitely worth a watch if your a racing fan or if your into your intense dramas. Enjoyable!",

In the case of RUSH, that something is racing. Specifically, Formula-1 racing. RUSH is another in a long line of films based on actual events to come out in 2013 and it ranks right up there with the best of them. It receives bonus points for the fact that those involved in the original events claim RUSH to actually be pretty accurate in its details, with a little creative liberty taken by the filmmakers to jazz it up a bit. It's the story of a rivalry that captured international attention in the 1976 Formula-1 racing season. James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) are very different men and both of them are incredibly talented drivers. The movie begins as the two struggle to make their mark on the Formula-3 circuit and follows their rise into the spotlight of Formula-1 in the pursuit of the world championship. As the two battle neck-and-neck for position, their rivalry fuels them to push harder and faster until a disastrous moment changes both their lives and professional relationship. RUSH has become my favorite film from director Ron Howard (note: I've never seen APOLLO 13 so that could change. I know, blasphemy.) and is probably one of my top favorite movies from the year. It succeeded at both making racing interesting to a non-fan while crafting two incredibly interesting characters who are competing for polar opposite reasons.",

Director Ron Howard who has given us classics like a beautiful mind , to name a few has delivered a directorial take resplendent with tight editing n in the process bringing us a slick, stylishly crafted, intelligently made n high on octane, edge of the seat thriller , accrued by some good confident performances by both the lead actors.. Even though i ain't a racing fan & till now haven't witnessed a single race even on TV but such is the intensity, racy feel to the movie, right from the first scene, that one doesn't even require an intermission.. Though the rivalry shown is guess, a tad exaggerated but who cares with the great view on offer!!! Not to seize any credits from both the lead actors, Hemsworth & Daniel, who as shown later during the end, look quite the champions they have portrayed on screen.. There is the flamboyant, boisterous & carefree maclaren driver, who believes in living life on the edge, making use of every min.available & never abiding by the rules.. Contrastingly, his competitor up next is a German , a boring , serious guy who stops in the middle of a race to avoid any mishaps, after images of his wife appear in his mind.. Who speaks not so fluent English but is a master at his work, knows his machines inside out n is a disciplined types.. Worth seeing is when he ,while driving a borrowed up car is questioned of not being a racy driver, since neither does he possess long hair, nor flamboyant enough to be called one!!! At this he retorts saying that he does not see any incentives /rewards on driving faster!!! Also worthy is the detailing, the picturisation of races, the cars itself, the background score by the famous zimmer.. In fact, the human emotions, fear & risks involved have been explored & presented to us in a never seen manner.. Indeed their rivalry is the highlight of the movie, which prompted each of them to give it their best.. They don't interact much with each other but do look the part ,especially at the end, seen conversing with each other.. It indeed is a great watch, & not only for some cheap action or some racy sequences..",
111,11 October 2013,Troy_Campbell,8, Immersive and heart-pumping.,"Based on the true story of one F1's greatest rivalries - between thrill-seeking British playboy James Hunt and the fiercely dedicated Austrian perfectionist Niki Lauda - Ron Howard's latest is, as the title suggests, a cinematic adrenaline rush. We get a quick and dirty intro into both drivers before we're thrown headfirst into their respective F1 careers, and specifically, the 1976 season that saw their on-track feud boil down to the final event in Japan, where heavy rain and treacherous road conditions provided a dangerous finale. Howard barely stops for a breath in the two hours of Rush; whether it's the edge-of-your-seat races or the turbulent personal lives of our competitive duo on screen, the movie never stalls or bores. One of Hollywood's newest A-list members, Chris Hemsworth, proves he can do more than hunky action roles with a wonderful and surprisingly subtle portrayal of Hunt, however it is, without a shadow of a doubt, Bruhl who really impresses. The underrated German actor imbues his Lauda with multiple layers and a slippery charisma in a spectacular performance that, with any justice, will garner him attention come awards season. Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography and Hans Zimmer's score are expectedly first-rate, however a special mention must go out to the sound design team who have constructed a thundering and immersive aural experience that positions you squarely in the high-risk, high-octane environment whilst sending vibrations through your chest and getting your heart pumping at a million miles an hour. Don't steer away if you know nothing of the subject, this movie is accessible to anybody who loves their sporting biopics or great motion pictures in general.",

I was almost stunned at how cliché sounding the exposition was in the first act. I thought, OK it starts out by-the-numbers, but it will finish off a winner (can't help with the racing analogies). I was disappointed how little racing footage was shown. I have yet to see a properly made movie about the drama that occurs on the track during a race. I don't know why directors claim that watching racing is boring. We get glimpses of the forces at hand as the camera is jerked around when attached to the car.

The good thing about Fast is that you really don't need to know much about he sport to enjoy it. The film is all about the rivalry between two men that are both talented, but with totally different personalities. In the case of Rush the two men in question are James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Their rivalry is similar too many others in formula one history. It is the classic battle between the racer who lives on the edge and the driver who accumulates points by not taking risks to ensure finishing in every race. The personalities of Hunt and Lauda reflect their driving styles. Their rivalry is bitter and personal and the film focuses on the world championship in the 1976 season. ",

Hunt was born in 1947 in London and Lauder was born in 1949 in Austria. Yet both men had similar economic and personal backgrounds. Hunt's father was a successful stockbroker and Lauder was from a family of businessmen. Their families were unsupportive of their decision to shun their wealthy heritage in favour of becoming racing car drivers. Hunt at one point considered being a doctor. 1976 is remembered to be one of the most dramatic years in the Grand Prix's history and by that point they had developed polar reputations for themselves. Hunt was a drinker, took drugs, vomited before every race and is said to have slept with over five thousand women. Alternately, Lauder was characterised as ""cold, hard logic"" and a technical expert on driving. He became a major advocator for driver safety in the sport. ",

The previous auto racing movies like Days of Thunder, Talladega Nights and Driven just don't capture the feel of what it's really like to be a professional auto driver.

It tells the real life story of the rivalry between car racers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Both are different characters and neither are especially likable, but they're both well rounded and excellent played. Chris Hemsworth, a promising actor who really is choosing his films well, is very good as Hunt, but Daniel Bruhl is even better as Lauda, and his performance might be the best individual element of the film.

Bruhl's focused, steel-eyed stare and effortlessly executed diction is filled with a sly sense of irony and sets apart what could have been a routine impersonation of a cold, clipped Germanic workhorse. After all these years, Howard still can't figure out how to deliver action without having to explain it to you and, as such, relies heavily on screenwriter Peter Morgan's heavy-handed exposition to tell you what you need to know. Morgan accomplishes this by having sportscasters yell into microphones about how the action taking place is so exciting; the result is condescending. Other than Bruhl, there isn't much else to recommend, with a couple of Howard's collaborators worth noting, cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle and composer Hans Zimmer, turning in lesser work than they are capable of. Being a racing movie, it's edited within an inch of its life by longtime Howard colleagues Dan Hanley and Mike Hill; but their work is at least clean enough that you can reasonably follow along.

139,16 September 2019,jammasta-1,6," ""Days of Thunder,"" but without the stupid.","Having seen the rating this film has on this site, I was expecting something much more compelling.
For starters, the film takes a few liberties with historical accuracy - such as shifting the races on the F1 calendar - but most of all, it fails to capture the shade of the period. Hunt and Lauda are starting their careers in the immediate aftermath of the Sixties, a period characterised by an increasing gloom. There were fuel crises, there was terrorism, economies on the downturn and people trodden over by capitalism, side by side with the events in the film (1973-76). Meanwhile, this film makes the period seem as rosy as the two main characters, essentially spoiled rich kids driven by their personal manias. Even in its treatment of the drama of F1 - the death of numerous F1 drivers during the 70s, before the sport was regulated into an entertainment behemoth by Ecclestone & co. - the film offers only the occasional piece of gore, making it really hard to feel for the bunch of a-holes sitting in those tiny metal boxes. The sharp editing and vivid colours turn this into a comic book fairytale, largely evading the underlying historical shifts that can well be personified by Hunt and Lauda.
All of this wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't for the fact that this film purports to represent a historically-accurate image of two actual historical personages during an actual historic moment in F1's history. To even out the narrative burden between Hunt and Lauda, ""Rush"" makes Lauda the narrator while focusing the attention primarily on Hunt. There's reason to that, since Lauda is being presented as a quiet perfectionist, while Hunt is the loud, romantic hero of the kind they don't make anymore. This might make it easier for the viewer to recognise the Austrian as someone who's looking out to the future, while Hunt is locked in the past. At the same time, though, the film actively sells Hunt as the hero we can identify with or look up to, selling his childishness and shallowness as evidence of some inner depths, while the thoroughly two-dimensional Lauda is afforded just enough screen time to deliver some of the blandest and most obvious lines about the heroism of an F1 driver. Hunt may win the title in the end, while Lauda will get it back the following year, but in this film, no one really wins.
As for acting, this is definitely Hemsworth's film. For all his undeniable talent, Bruhl is too quietly competent to steal the limelight. There's a whole list of decent cameos here, but they're essentially edited beyond recognition, and in some cases, so firmly circumscribed by the bland writing that they are limited to a gallery of nice faces.
If your choice is between ""Days of Thunder"" and this, by all means, go for ""Rush.""",

A lot of stuff is CGI enchanced, mostly you don't notice it, but a couple of times you could notice they are in front of a bluescreen instead of in a car. They also used real cars and most of the racing shots look very real. Hans Zimmer provides a very functional score that doesn't draw to much attention to itself. I enjoyed this movie a lot and I would certainly recommend it to any car enthusiast or F1 fan but I won't put it in my 2013 top 5 film list. Like a lot of movies about sports and rivalry therein it feels like it follows a certain formula and unfolds in a very straightforward way. This keeps it from reaching 'instant classic' status, but don't let that keep you from seeing this fine film",

The rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt is picturized to perfection in this flick. The F1 car race shots were top-notch and were shot with great authenticity. Above all, I loved Alexandra Maria Lara's character who has very few scenes in the movie, but that was well enough to mark a lasting impression in my heart. This movie shows how one's perspectives drives them to success or failure in their life.

Director Ron Howard's masterpiece is based on the real life rivalry between 70's Formula One Drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Hunt being the playboy & carefree one, while Lauda is more of the standoffish but focused one. Chris Hemsworth accelerated his serious acting career with a grand performance as Hunt. But it was Daniel Bruhl that won this acting race by putting it up in Oscar-worthy gear with his winning performance as Lauda. Howard geared the film with precise precision in his direction. Peter Morgan's script was riding, I mean writing high with right lanes, I mean lines. So yes I am rushing you to see this movie because it had the right formula. ***** Excellent",

The race is exciting on and off the tracks. Directed with precision and heart by Ron Howard, ""Rush"" runs on adrenaline at 220 miles an hour and the audience is instantly taken on an unforgettable ride. Chris Hemsworth plays the reckless charismatic English playboy Jim Hunt, and Daniel Bruhl gives a spot on performance of meticulous and serious Austrian racer Niki Lauda. The story would be unbelievable if it wasn't true. But Director Ron Howard has brought to life all the excitement of the 1976 Grand Prix complete with the personal stories of Hunt and Lauda. The film is gripping and a visual rush as Academy award cinematographer Anthony Dodd Mantle puts the viewer directly in the driver seat. Hans Zimmer's moves the story in a wonderful and pulsating soundtrack. The drama depicts rivals Hunt and Lauda and the incredible events that lead to the perilous Nurburgring race and finally the Japanese Grand Prix. As each driver accrues points in each race, they reach the dangerous rain drenched final head to head for the championship title. ""RUSH"" is an exhilarating film between two talented drivers beautifully performed by Hemsworth and Bruhl. The lives and personalities of these two drivers couldn't be more different and yet their respect and admiration for each other and passion for racing formula 1 is palpable. The film is excellent and accurate in its details of the true story and rivalry of Hunt and Lauda. ""RUSH"" drives and delivers!",

149,1 October 2013,FilmMuscle,9, Do You Feel That Rush?!,"Wow, I never knew I'd be so engrossed in a film about racecars. The main reason behind that compliment is because the film delves into so much more than the sport itself, and that's essentially what makes a great sports movie and is why most of them basically suck, in my opinion. Rush, like Moneyball before it, fully concentrates on the drive (no pun intended) and soul behind the individuals who choose to take on such risky endeavors or sports in general. The picture overwhelmingly benefits from excellent performances from Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl especially. Whereas James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) plays the stereotypical jock (ladies man, bad boy), Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) starts out as more of an underdog, at least, in terms of his social life. As he witnesses the environment James proudly surrounds himself with, that jealousy and bitterness can be clearly sighted in Niki's eyes. Thus, he gets down and dirty from the business side of things, and this leads to a momentous, highly personal rivalry where both persistently overpower the other with their own set of methods. As a result, the audience witnesses pure complexity and depth within these two characters with their own special backstories and circumstances; the film wisely takes the time to build each character's traits and personality up in order to create a much more satisfying ultimate showdown- the one element that always heightens the tension and popularity of a rivalry in sports: one where the opponents have fully- developed personas and distinctive characteristics.

The two men had a lot in common. They were fortunate sons of wealthy families. They were obsessed with winning. While Hunt was a playboy, he was willing to die on the race track to gain a split-second advantage over his competition.

In most pictures, with two leading characters, there will usually be one everyone likes and one they don't. Not in this film. Both are captivating and likable. Amazing talent in this picture. Even those viewers not totally into auto racing will enjoy this one because in addition to spectacular racing history and scenes, this one has a great story.

With the exception of Ron Howard, all aspects of this film where keeping me from seeing it. However, the racing (Formula 1) aspect is the least poignant part of the film. As always, Howard's multi-faceted approach to a film is a grasping angle to what this film offers. Hemsworth's role was far from the macho and mundane characters he has been type-casted in in the past, and Brulh's performance is probably the best of the film. The dynamic relationship between the two main characters and their impeccable direction of their story, from Howard, makes this film an enjoyable watch and perhaps a reference point for the genre of future racing films, that until now have always exhausted my senses.",

Eventually, I did see Rush in a full theater on a Saturday night, and absolutely no one in the audience talked throughout the movie.

Stylistically, it's impressive. Howard clearly has a passion for sports competition and wants to make a film comparable to the best sports films. In that, he succeeds.

I had only ever seen a few minutes of a Hemsworth in Thor, and had low expectations of a comic book Ozzie actor. I was wrong, the story is brilliantly told, and the movie captures perfectly a less PC, less rigid, less technical, more colourful, more risky and more exciting motor sport era. Hemsworth turns out to be a charismatic actor who brings a sense of the dangerous (reckless) energy that Hunt had as the last off the. 'Gentlemen amateurs'. Lauda heralded a new era and proved that although less reckless, he embodied courage in a different way. The rivalry was real and fuelled a great seasons racing. The movie really caught the era for me, the background captured perfectly in flashes of news, fashion, and a general looseness that is missing from our photoshopped era. Supporting actors are great, Olivia Wilde even looks like Suzy Hunt as I remember her... But the main thing is that the pace is like a race, and the movie drew me in with real drama, no mean feat given that I already knew who won! I don't understand some of the pedants who think their view of this history does how supersedes all others. For me this was real as it should be and dramatic as it could be. As for some prurient type complaining at seeing Hemsworths buttocks, go watch the latest Disney film, and leave this for the adults amongst us. Fantastic.",

It reminded me of a souped up version of the Black Stallion but with cars instead, and two equally ambitious characters who both love to win. It is one of the best movies I have watched this year. It was so intense I was literally clutching my glass of wine! The visuals are amazing, the soundtrack was just perfect for the movie that takes place in the 70's. It also has superb acting! Ron Howard did such a great job directing, and the pace of the movie just flowed naturally and at a good clip! It was exciting, dramatic, and thrilling.

When I first heard about it, I didn't have the greatest of hopes, worrying that Ron Howard wouldn't portray the sport correctly, or do it a disservice, but after seeing various interviews & him popping up at various events throughout the Formula 1 calendar, I was starting to go along with the hype & was in no way disappointed. This is the best movie I've seen this year. I was gripped from start to finish.

Everything feels perfect in this move. The acting, the tense cinematography and editing, Hans Zimmer's music, just all of it; but the one element that makes this the best movie of 2013 is the Character Development for both Niki and James. Niki starts out as the emotionless professional while James starts out as a ""bad boy""/Adrenaline Junkie; both don't care about each other but that changes throughout the entire movie. For example: Before Niki's crash, James encourages everyone to let the race continue despite the rain and Niki's disagreements, showing us that both characters are at their lowest points; Niki showing some hints of fear for the first time and James, having nearly lost everything trying to beat Niki and is barely in the lead. During the final race however, James attempts to call it off, saying that its ""lethal"" out there with heavy rain and during the press conference, showing some hints of worry for possibly Niki. And Niki even forfeits the race rather than usually finish it. That kind of character development is executed well here and it elevates the film to a whole new level. And Ron Howards directing is great.",

Niki Lauda's comeback is probably the top10 unbelievable and inspirational comebacks of all times. The relationship between Hunt and Lauda was a little bit over-dramatized for the movie, but not too much. In real life, the two drivers were good friends and had immense respect towards each other, and the film, although antagonizing them with each other, manages to show how deeply these two guys respected each other. Chris Hemsworth does a brilliant job as James Hunt and Daniel Brühl is simply phenomenal as Niki Lauda.

Consider the impressive Frost/Nixon and his latest effort, Rush—about as far from each other in style and scale as you can get—even if they do share a common theme.

This movie got a good review on ""At the movies"" so that also made me more inclined to watch it. However, seeing Australian Chris Hemsworth as the ""other"" driver (James Hunt) in the clip for the movie on that TV show made me think that his English accent seemed quite contrived...sort of a clipped, aristocratic accent...I'm thinking ball park Prince Philip territory here!

The way they show that clash at the end of the conversation, where they don't understand what each other is saying and they try to impose their values and ideas on the other person.

It was all about the vicarious thrills of speeding of the cars, crashes, shunts and the chequered flag. We saw the drivers spraying large bottles of champagne around, but we did not get to care what they were really like or much about the technique of racing. So the full enormity of Nicki Lauda's quick recovery from his burns to getting back into the driver's seat did not get properly examined at the time. Ron Howard's film redresses this by revealing the brilliant mind of Lauda, his crises, his struggles and his professionalism. It also, of course, shows the swashbuckling bravado of James Hunt and the glamour he brought to F1. The only criticism I would make was the film's budget could have been used to better bring alive some of the exotic locations, such as the final 1976 race off next to Mount Fuji, which heavily relies on computer graphics.",

Ron Howard's new film Rush, scores on many levels and fails in a few. First problem is the marketing for the film. They give Chris Hemsworth's character all of the spot light on the billboards and posters, when Daniel Bruhl should be the one. There are a few advertisements with Bruhl on them, but he needs to be front and center, because he is the leading actor in this film and outshines the whole cast. Hemsworth is just a more marketable face. ",
198,4 October 2013,eleanor-robinson3,10, Absolutely fantastic...,"Before you read this review, let me just say that I am a 15 year old teenage girl with little/no knowledge of Formula 1 and its history. However, I thought this film was brilliant. Perfect casting with Chris Hemsworth playing British playboy James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl playing 'rat faced'Austrian Niki Lauda. The relationship between both drivers is one of the main focus points of the movie, and was the main reason i love this film, because even though they both race against each for the F1 title and frequently call each other a***h****, the clearly have a profound amount of respect for each other and you could go as far as saying they were friends.The actual racing shots were at times beautiful and had my adrenaline pumping and on the edge of my seat in the cinema. another thing i loved about this film was the way that, as well as being about races, the film was paced like a race, a fact I didn't realize until i came out of the cinema and thought about it. Hunt and Lauda both in the lead at different points. Lauda when he beats Hunt in the first half of the F1 season, Hunt when Lauda crashes and melts half of his face off, a scene which had me wincing in my seat, as well as a particular scene wear Lauda tries to get his helmet back on having only half healed, his ear still incomplete. the last point I will make is the fact that you don't have to be a F1 fan or have any previous knowledge of Hunt or Lauda's historic feuding to be amazed by this film, as well as learning a tremendous amount! This film is a must see for 2013!",

Well, this first sentence was only true before I went to watch Rush. I give you, that my two and only reasons to go and see this movie were the leads - Chris (think Thor)and Daniel (ah, Good Bye Lenin and 7 dias en La Habana, and boy I'm happy I did. I must say that my interest in F1 was quite superficial, and only in the 1990s I was somewhat caught by the sport when the statistically (and statistically he IS) the best driver of F1 ruled the track,and I've never really troubled myself with F1 history and all those discussions of who's the best and all, thus the story behind 1976's F1 championship was totally new to me. Getting back more closely to the movie, I'd say just this - in my opinion Rush is the best 2013 movie I've seen, Chris and Daniel did wonderful jobs, and if this movie won't get any nominations (think Oscars) I'll be very very surprised. And now I'm off to continue with some old F1 GPs videos and some documentaries as the movie's so great that I'm actually inspired to dig deeper into the story itself. 10 out of 10 and a huge +",

Two of the most popular drivers at that time were James Hunt (Hemsworth)and Niki Lauda (Brühl). They were instant rivals and personal enemies. During the 1976 season the rivalry hit its peak and the two found themselves neck and neck for the world championship. When Niki is involved in an horrific accident the two realize what they mean to each other. I was a little hesitant about watching this going in for a few reasons. I am not a racing fan nor am I a fan of racing movies. I wasn't a big fan of Days Of Thunder...so that is my disclaimer. As far as this movie goes it was better then I was expecting but I never really felt a connection with any of the people and when the accident happened it didn't really have any affect on me. Days Of Thunder did have more of a rivalry feel to it and played that up. This one focused more on each driver individually more then the racing rivalry. When you watch it you will know what I mean.

(The irony of the story is both characters have huge egos,push limits and left wealthy families with promising futures.) Each action of Hunt and Lauda pushes the other driver to be better.

After a series of battles in the lower formulas , the Englishman James Hunt and extroverted womanizer and the Austrian champion Niki Lauda introverted and meticulous compete in the race for the world title with no holds barred . Ron Howard has the great merit of being able to bring to the screen with great effectiveness one of the great duels that inflame the world sports in many disciplines . Light years now separated Formula 1 then from today , on the one hand that's good because you have made ​​huge steps to ensure the safety of drivers and fortunately the number of serious accidents is significantly reduced. On the other hand the progress and development of the technology have made the reign of the current Formula 1 engineers and telemetry a fact which has removed much of the epic from this sport. So here we are in 1976 and catapulted in part in previous years to see the challenge between two completely different ways of being both from the human point of view both sports . Hunt exuberant , sculptural and surrounded by women and friends and obsessed with winning a world championship. Lauda , a little more meticulous and does not care to please people . The fact is that beyond the mutual rivalry the two are estimated and respect . The accident at the Nurburgring in Lauda ( think of a GP 22 km long that unraveled in the middle of a forest creeps ) is reconstructed in detail . At the same time the film does not skimp on the track of great shots and sequences of the GP in Monza with the Austrian return to racing after a month and a half from the terrible fire of his Ferrari with a sensational fourth place and the epic final race to Fuji is a real treat for the eyes. Howard said that gives us a very good film ( and make movies about Formula 1 is not at all easy ) the cast behaves really well : Hensworth finally stops on the role of Thor and it shows all. Top of the situation and the real surprise is Bruhl perfect in the role of Lauda and with a great trick for the aftermath of the accident. Well the female protagonists and a mention also to our Field bean that appears in some scenes in the role of companion Lauda , Regazzoni .

Nikki Lauda on the other hand also want's to be the best but he want's to stay the best and will continue to fight for it.

The character work from Daniel Brühl and Chris Hemsworth is great, and that's what gets you invested in the story. Niki Lauda (the man that Daniel Brühl plays) proves to be the most fascinating person in the film, because he has such a uniquely abrasive personality, and yet shows that there are some emotions underlying that rough exterior. I was definitely interested in where his journey would end up.

Realty that a review needs to please the reader enough to acknowledge the off chance opportunity of selecting to watch a movie based on reviews rather than watch what is available or the entire release list found in the first world countries. 
First world review might need several pages from 'the five C's of cinematography' but to like and recommend a movie takes patience over attendance in cinema halls or movie 'marathons'. The movie 'Rush' needs to be viewed as a movie about sports and considered in the light of those achievements like in the Grand Prix circle where Lewis Hamilton is fifth in the lead up to the Hungarian Grand Prix or the circuit at Hungary who is a poor nation.",

Of course liberties have been taken with the facts, but this is inevitable when the events of several years are compressed into a couple of hours. The recreation of racing in the seventies is generally well done but for those who lived through the 1976 season the movie lacks dramatic impact. Hemsworth and Bruhl do a good job as Hunt and Lauda, but the other roles are virtually bit parts. The portrayal of BRM's Louis Stanley (a notorious tyrant) is particularly poor.

Special effects were limited but tastefully done. Ron Howard did a masterful job. The two actors made the characters very believable and come to life just as one expected them. the pace was very gripping (pun intended!) and all of the supporting cast were excellent.

The dual narrative followed each of the drivers as they overcame struggles and challenges along their journey, which worked perfectly for this film.

288,14 September 2015,anaconda-40658,8, A Real Rush.,"Rush (2013): Dir: Ron Howard / Cast: Chris Hemsworth, Daniel Bruhl, Olivia Wilde, Alexandra Maria Lara, Pierfrancesco Favino: Electrifying action sports drama about that adrenalin rush when faced with stern competition. True story of the battle between two Formula One drivers. Chris Hemsworth plays English playboy James Hunt who boozes and hooks up with several women. Daniel Bruhl plays the focused Austrian driver Niki Lauda who is appalled by the actions of Hunt. Set mainly in 1976 with Ron Howard creating exciting racing action as well as tension when weather creates a major crash. One narrative element that isn't examined to its fullest is the married lives of the two driver. Both drivers react differently to this. Hemsworth creates the flamboyant competitive personality of Hunt while Bruhl is equally great as Lauda who survives a nasty crash that leaves him scarred. One big flaw is that Olivia Wilde, as Hunt's wife who leaves him for Richard Burton, and Alexandra Maria Lara as Lauda's loyal wife seem like an after thought and are too much in the distant background. Pierfrancesco Favino plays another racer named Clay Regazzoni from Switzerland, who died a few years prior to this film's release. This is not a film about Formula One. It regards a rivalry so fierce that the two factors can do no more than nod and respect each other. Ron Howard began his directing career with an inferior race car comedy called Grand Theft Auto. Here he raises the rod with intense focus as two champions pit against each other in a struggle for fame, triumph and hopefully dignity. Score: 8 / 10",

Die-hards will immediately spot the film's minor inaccuracies and dramatic licence taken with certain aspects of 1970s F1, but, for me, these didn't detract from the movie in the slightest (I personally loved seeing my local racing circuit, Cadwell Park, standing in for other circuits in some scenes).

So, the story was promising (getting into deep dungeons of friendship/rivalry/antagonisms of main characters) but it ended up wandering around almost random scenes from their lives and ending ,as usual, just when it becomes interesting. Now something on the ""technical aspects of the craft"": Cast is very good and so are the performances (two main characters only), as well as editing. The direction can be described as ""somewhat too nervous and erratic"", probably following the script. There were some good ideas but, unfortunately, not developed properly.

Clever way to get fast cars and things blowing up into a film without it being gratuitous. The two men call each other ""asshole,"" and they're both well justified, but as the film goes on and the excitement and stress builds, we see flashes of the good human sides of both and it's hard to decide who to root for more.",

It proved to be such a pleasant surprise. The basic premise of the movie is healthy, competitive and life altering rivalry between Nikki Lauda and James Hunt. Famous F1 drivers of mid 70s who went on to become world champions.Nikki Lauda is world champion and is competing with James Hunt for the title for the year 1976. Ron Director of the movie has given such brilliant portrait of both the drivers. Nikki is shown as technically correct, focus and highly skilled driver. James Hunt is flamboyant driver, who is more courageous and has nothing to lose. The Championship is a critical junction when Nikki meets with an accident and gives opportunity to James Hunt to cash on and he does. James Hunt wins the World Championship for the year 1976. One of the capturing moments in the movie is when Nikki Lauda makes a come back after getting seriously injured and wins the fourth position in race. Daniel Bruhl gave fantastic performance. little do i know why he was not nominated for Oscars. Nikki was true star though he lost the Championship but still remained the winner. Amazing heart capturing movie. Loved the way it was directed.",

The character types here involve an impulsive party boy and an arrogant professional, a dynamic which gets repetitive at times, slinging the same insults back and forth.

I did not know of this story which surprises me, although I was only 11 when this was happening, I knew of the hero's of golf, tennis, and many race drivers, not your main stream sports, but never heard of these guys. I'm really surprised. This is Ron Howard at his best. Chris Hemsworth does a fantastic job as James Hunt. I hardly can believe he is the same actor that plays Thor. Since I knew nothing of the real men, I purposely avoided looking up details so watching the movie was very suspenseful. Worth your time and then some. Daniel Brühl also does an amazing job as Niki Lauda. You have to give it to these guys. Great job.",

Story wise, as it is a biography, it is quite interesting and entertaining, even though everything could have gone wrong with a movie about racing. Fortunatelly the driving scenes are not the main core of the film and that makes the movie interesting to audiences other than formula 1 fans. Next stop the performances. The two main stars are making a good work with their characters, especially as the film gets to the accident, when the characters must overcome their superficial status that they had for the first part of the movie and focus on the emotions and how deep actually their rivalry goes. For those who know the story there won't be any surprises, but for those who don't, the plot is gripping enough. So 7 out of 10.",

The directing from Ron Howard was flawless, the score by Hans Zimmer was without surprise breath-taking and among his best work in my eyes. The film ends when you want it to, not too early or too late. I was not alive when the actual events took place but I have been told that the plot follows the events accurately.

However, the film's constant bombardment of tense race after tense race made it lose sight, it was slightly dreary.

I'm not saying that's a bad thing. After all, Howard is arguably one of the most consistent directors working today as far as quality goes, and Rush is a high-quality film. However, it feels like it's lost somewhere between a drama and an action movie. There are a lot of scenes representing both genres, but the two somehow seem out of sync.

I rooted for both Hunt and Louda, portrayed brilliantly by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl, which is quite unusual for me as I normally would be quick to take sides in movies such as these that surround rivalry and competition. This only shows how incredibly Rush handled it's characters and their motives. The cinematography used by Ron Howard throughout this movie was top notch, I felt immersed in every scene. There were many emotional aspects of this movie that I also liked, which connected me to the characters a lot more.

The way the relationship between James Hunt and Niki Lauda is portrayed in such a beautiful and intelligent way that after the movie ends you won't be able to take sides on who you would support from the two champion drivers.

Those race sequences are just amazing and lifelike and dialogs are sharp and succinct. Cinematography puts you in the driver seat and Bruhl as Lauda and Hemsworth as Hunt are chalk and cheese. Hemsworth's roguish, play boyish, devil may care attitude provides the perfect antithesis to Bruhl's composed, demure persona.

371,1 November 2016,Screen_Blitz,9, Superbly crafted biopic with an outstanding execution of human competition,"There's always an interesting story to be told, and with directors like Ron Howard, the mastermind behind the Academy Award-winning 'A Beautiful Mind', working behind the camera to bring these compelling tales to life; a powerful biopic supplemented with solid craftsmanship and stellar performances can only be expected. To all justice, Howard gracefully accomplishes this feat. Howard's telling of the historical events of the fierce competition between two Formula One racers comes off as a compelling thrill ride that not only feels original rather than your average sports underdog story, but also boasts plenty of substance as well as some graceful performances by its two likable leads including Chris Hemsworth of 'Thor' and Daniel Bruhl of 'Inglourious Basterds'. Set in the 1970s, this film tells the story of the rivalry between James Hunt (played by Chris Hemsworth), a handsome English Former One driver, and Niki Lauda (played by Daniel Bruhl), a methodical Austrian Formula One driver. WIth both men desperate of earning the championship title on the Grand Prix tracks, Hunt and Lauda go to great measures to outdo each other on and off the tracks in a fierce competition that threatens to not only hit the brakes on their careers, but destroy their own personal beings.",

It's amazing how much these two actors look and sound like their characters, the way Lauda speaks in clipped sentences, the way Hunt's like, ""Yeah, whatever"". I can't even drive, but the dialogue in this film is how race car drivers explain racing, from too fast in the corners, to rain on the track, to the grip on the tires. It's ironic that Lauda wanted to boycott the race he was hurt in. And I like how the film shows the way the right kind of adversity makes people better at what they do. The dark clouds covering the sun seem so literary I don't know how I feel about them in a film, but it was a good way to show the dread involved. I think the film could've been longer. I saw an interview with Ron Howard where he said it was hard to get it down to two hours, and I wish he'd made this three hours or so. It felt like a sample tray of these two men's lives. (Am I being too feminine here?) Although I wouldn't want anything weepy, a little go get'em, honey, would've warmed my little girl heart. (And can you tell I really couldn't stand the Englishman?)

I am glade to see Chris Hemsworth in a non superhero movie i almost forgot how good he is as an actor. Daniel Brühl nailed it as Nikki Louda he truly steals the show. the dynamic of the two actors is the core of the movie they have an amazing chemistry they are opposite in their methods, personality and skills but have a mutual respect to each other both want to be the best also and the racing scene are really good again i am not an F-1 fan but it seem they know what they are doing and it felt accurate to the actual race in short i was glade i got to watch it, it lived up to the hype",
376,30 January 2014,awbatman500,10, Rush by far the greatest movie of 2013!!!,"Recently getting into Formula One back in 2010, I found the historical aspect of F1 back in the 1970's. Before this movie I had no idea what happened and I had no knowledge of James Hunt or Niki Lauda. After this movie I couldn't wait for it to come out on iTunes so I could watch it all the time. I have watched it 6 times since I got it last week and I recommend this movie to the fullest. Greatest movie of 2013, Ron Howard did amazing.",
377,11 December 2015,barryrd,8, Intense Rivalry on the Racetrack,"This movie about the intense rivalry and hostility between car racing champs Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) and James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) has the feel of a movie and documentary. The two personalities are a contrast between the disciplined, serious Lauda and the partying, fun-loving Hunt. The film-making was spectacular as it showed the view behind the wheel as cars race at terrifying speed. In one event, won by a Hunt, Lauda literally crashed and burned, resulting in serious lung damage and permanent scarring. (Lauda opposed holding the event because of the poor race conditions but entered against his better judgement.) Later, he returned to show his unyielding drive as he continued to compete and win. Both became world champions and beat one another in fiercely contested races. What stays with the viewer is the image of two highly driven young men whose rivalry brings out the best in each other as they mature and come to respect one another. They are not only great racing drivers but become men of character. Once again, director Ron Howard has created a movie that speaks to the heart with this great addition to his many directing achievements.",
378,25 September 2013,angelic_wounds,10, Nothing short of spectacular,"Captivating, breathtaking, beautiful. This is how I would describe Howard's latest project, ""Rush"", a movie which tells you about the passion of sports as much as it tells you about life and death.",
379,22 August 2015,bryank-04844,6, 'Rush' is a solid film with two brilliant performances from Hemsworth and Lauda.,"There's no doubt that Ron Howard can make great films. His movies have won numerous awards and have starred some of the biggest names in the business at one point or another. That said, with only a few exceptions such as 'Apollo 13′ or 'Parenthood', most of his movies tend to be forgettable after the first year or so and begin to collect dust in people's movie collections. Unfortunately, that's also the case with 'Rush'. People may love it at first, but I doubt that anybody will mention it next year.",

I wasn't expecting the story to be so much deeper than two arrogant men just racing formula one cars. Their story was actually very captivating and they both have the spirit to make them unforgettable.,
383,28 September 2013,demetriocoffman,6," Great directing, acting, cinematography for an average story.","The best thing about this flick is Ron Howard's directing, editing,cinematography,special effects and the soundtrack. I grew up in the 70's and it seemed like 1976 all over again. The fast cars and loud engines almost shake you in your seat and that alone makes for a good movie. The racetrack scenes showing the rain pouring down makes you feel something out of The Lord of the Rings. Now, the story line and driver rivalry seemed a bit average and not necessary entertaining. In fact it appears almost made up in parts and over exaggerated just to add some entertainment. But overall this is a typical racing flick from 1976 with updated technology for 2013.",

387,3 October 2021,jdring2007,7," compelling in parts, mostly thanks to Daniel Brühl, but too much slow motion and glamour","A lot of potential and I think it still told its biographic story well, faithfully, and by the end, powerfully, but it often get like a chore to get through. Way too much slow motion, especially for a movie called Rush, ironically, and while Chris Hemsworth did prove he has acting chops it also seemed like a bare minimum, any seriousness undermined by his playboy characteristics. Perhaps true to form of the real James Hunt, world champion and a damn handsome man. However the true star of this film was undeniably Brühl, in my opinion. The movie was a drama tinged with humor and suspense, the latter of which was often minced by abridged racing scenes after extensive buildup.",
388,4 May 2018,terryraywilliams,10, Brilliant Film,I found Rush to be the best movie of its kind. It is a rarity to see a racing film done so magnificently. I was not surprised to learn that Ron Howard directed this masterpiece. ,
389,28 September 2014,clearwinner,8, Action Packed,"This movie is a nice watch, I would say a well directed movie showing the rivalry between two formula one champions. I did not know anything about the two prior to this movie but the movie gave me good insight. I enjoyed this movie but I felt the story was too simple as if evident what was going to happen. It felt like a commercial film. The conversations between the two should have been more insightful. The action scenes were really good. I did not get bored that is the best thing in this movie but definitely not a great movie. The movie could be said a bit clichéd. The music was not that good. Some of the scenes were not at all required. The most depressing thing for me was Natallie Dormer just appears for 5 minutes. But Nevertheless if you love action then this film ranks very high among the action flicks due to sheer direction because it is very difficult to make a movie on car racing that too for the period of 1970-76. So go for it if you love action",
390,8 February 2014,AlfhildrTheSwede,10, Superb!,"I think this movie is one of the best of the year. I am not a fan of F1 racing but I have already watched this movie twice and I want to watch it again.There aren't any dull moments and I am a person who is easily bored while watching movies.The acting is superb. I think this is Hemsworth's best performance yet and Bruhl is simply amazing.The producers really managed to get the atmosphere right. I felt as if I was really living in the seventies and every time there were cars racing my heart would start to beat faster.This film really entrances its audience. All in all, watching this movie is definitely not a waste of time.",
391,20 January 2016,bbewnylorac,7, Pretty good entertainment,"Chris Hemsworth, playing playboy British 1970s Formula One driver James Hunt, is the poster boy for this film and sure, he is charismatic and really takes his role well. But the real star is Daniel Bruhl, who has the meatiest role as the forthright, stubborn, super-confident, ultra cool rival Austrian driver Niki Lauda. Director Ron Howard has a tough task, balancing the need to satisfy motor sport fans' need to see all that sweaty racing up on the big screen. But Howard also tries to portray real life events and people in a faithful and meaningful way, while keeping the scenes coming at a cracking pace. And he does a great job. The script is excellent. Apparently the writer dined with Lauda 30 times, and won his trust, and so the movie is filled with little details that make the characters seem human, as opposed to the two dimension, superhuman idols they could have been. It's really interesting to realise that Hunt and Lauda both rebelled against their families, and both had an almost insane desire to win. And the film also explores, very well, the extent to which both of them were willing to ignore the normal warning signs of extreme danger to their lives in exchange for fame and fortune. Hunt did it in driving in extremely wet conditions in the Japanese Grand Prix, and Lauda did it in the German track where he crashes and almost dies, and then, during his comeback, when he ignores the pain from his burn scars to get back into racing again. But as the film makes very obvious, to drive Formula One in the 1970s was very much to risk death. Everyone accepted it, and on any given day, either your number might come up and you die, or you win the race and get international praise and a big payment.",
392,9 February 2014,MasterWodan,9, Great movie that tops all expectations.,"Considering the unfortunately many poorly executed attempts at making racing inspired movies, my expectations of 'Rush' weren't all too high when I pressed the 'Play'-button on my DVD-player's remote control. ",

394,11 June 2014,sajid_trash,9, What a surprise!,"As i consider myself a die hard race car fan. And a frequent movie goer. And yet i did 2 things wrong before sitting for RUSH. I didn't know about the rivalry between JAMES HUNT and NIKI LAUDA in the '70s. And second thing is i didn't know its a Ron Howard movie. So i started watching the movie with an open mind. Thought, lets see what The Thor has in store for me. But boy i was wrong, so wrong. This is not some Chris Hemsworth show. The character played by Daniel Bruhl was incredible, and stronger than Chris Hemworth's one in some extent. From the get go this movie will suck you into the world of this two mad rivals. I thought, ""okay this is a movie about formula 1, but in the end the hero will come out as a winner."" Again... how wrong i was! Both characters are so strong and so well acted by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl that you will be confused, which guy to root for. They have their own reasons for their battles. Its story of the rivals from their point of views. I assure you that, you will love this rivalry and there growth in the process with your heart in you hand. Hunt is a playboy and a hot headed driver, on the other hand Lauda is calculative and great in setting up car. This is really battle between Heart v Brain. Though they are arch enemies but they have a certain respect for each other. When James Hunt beats down a reporter for humiliating Niki Lauda, that will give you chill. And for those who love Olivia Wilde, GOOD NEWS! She looks hot in this movie too. And Ron Howard did a great job, he is a great director and he proved it once again. Music are sublime and the color effect he used is amazing. I will give RUSH a 9. Go watch it, its worth the money and time.",

I think this film really makes you think about life and what you take for granted. It really was amazing and I must admit I had a few tears but that was properly because I am just a big girl. Lol. I seriously recommend this film, its enjoyable for everyone. I think the fact it is based on a true story also makes it more interesting and I think that is partly why I enjoyed it so much, it is very factual to what really happened and the story of James and Niki's friendship is also really nicely executed. Peter Morgan did an amazing job writing the screenplay and I think Ron Howard did a great job directing the film and he executed it very well.",

Rush doesn't divide good and evil like many other, Niki and James both are very different and are unique in their own way!",
399,13 December 2021,OneAnjel,7, Interesting film that is best watched by those somewhat familiar with the story or the sport of car racing,"As a little girl, I actually wanted to be a race car driver. My step-dad watched every race in the 60s with Mario Andretti in it. But since those days, I haven't spent a lot of time watching racing as a sport. This film caught my eye because Howard directed it and Chris Hemsworth is in it. He reminds me of kind of a cross between Brad Pitt and Jan Michael Vincent from my era . The film was interesting and mostly engaging. But, overall, I feel knowing the story before hand on at least some level would make the film more enjoyable. I had only a vague knowledge of Lauda or Hunt and the film had uncomfortable tension for me that was probably unintended since I wasn't sure how many bad accidents to expect. It also wasn't clear what actually caused that horrific accident since the film intentionally seems to show the pit-stop crew being hurried beyond their ability and showed parts of the car from the undercarriage as if something was wrong. Perhaps it was saying no one really knows what caused the crash.",

Casting is very very good . I really liked Alexandra Maria Lara as Marlene Lauda .And our ""THOR"" also did very good job & suits for the character very much.

Cinematically speaking, it was stunning, crank it up and enjoy an F1 car at high RPM screaming around the Nurburgring. Hemsworth and Bruhl bring Hunt and Lauda to life beautifully, I especially enjoyed Bruhls portrayal of Lauda, it was perfect. The racing in the movie was captured beautifully, this was a dangerous time in auto racing, before Nomex, crumple zones and safety standards, and they did a great job with it. The relationship between Lauda and Hunt is also captured beautifully, a love/hate, but respectful relationship. The movie made me laugh, cheer and shed a few man tears.....I can't say enough good things about this movie. I am buying the most expensive Blu Ray version I can find, easy 10/10.",

After I watched film,I looked on internet about Niki Lauda's life. I found that. he is respected person, he had a lot of championships and he is a beautiful wife; when we turn to movie we can see all of them so that's very successful adaption. To sum up movie was wonderful for every age. It deserve nine points from me. And also we have to celebrate Ron Howard ,Peter Morgan and everyone who contributed to the make this movie.",
404,20 November 2022,Paragon240,7," Rush isn't just a good racing movie. It's an excellent film, period.","Ron Howard pumps adrenaline straight into your veins with rivalry, risk, and high-stakes racing. The cinema and storytelling make the audience feel the intensity and danger of every race. Drivers are horribly disfigured and even die, forcing characters to stare their own mortality down every time they sit behind the wheel. Each character responds differently as they grapple with the peril of doing what they love. I didn't expect to enjoy this movie, but the true story of Niki Lauda and James Hunt, told with Howard's powerful realism and grit, was incredibly captivating. The racing scenes are beautifully filmed and framed with compelling character-driven storytelling. Be wanted, the R-rating results in some nudity and sex scenes, but if you are willing to fast forward or skip ahead, the rest of the film is worth it. I mean, Thor vs. Baron Zemo in race cars? What's not awesome about that?",

Maybe that is what I did wrong, expecting the usual Ron Howard film, but I was sadly disappointed with his work on this one. I will be the first to let you know a good movie from the next and I am really surprised with all the high ratings for this movie, but I was very disappointed with this one. Yes, you get great shots from the drivers perspective, okay racing scenes, decent character development, but not your leave the theater in deep thought and feeling like I took something with me from the theater like mostly all Ron Howard films. I actually saved the ticked stub right after I purchased it as a kind of memento to say I saw this film in the theaters, maybe 20 years down the road, but I actually threw this stub away in major disappointment that I Just spent 11.50 for this movie. yes, the plot is there, and I understand its a true story between these 2 racers, but this should have made it even more excellent of a movie that Ron Howard takes on. I should have known when I saw three other companies that were part producers of this movie besides Imagine, that right there should of shown that Ron didn't have full say when it came down to certain decisions. Has Ron finally sold out for money, instead of great film. It seems that way, and I have lost a lot of respect from him from this film he just put out. I had a feeling since I haven't heard much about this movie from the word of mouth movie chatter that I normally pick up on, I thought maybe it was because everyone has broken bad and that is all there was to talk about, but I see now that I couldn't even be excited to start a conversation or be involved excitedly to discuss this movie with friends or family. I gave it 6 and that's pretty good just based on the okay visuals you get and how hard it is to shoot fast driving scenes. Say it ain't so Ron, is this what we should be expecting from here on out. What is with all the other partnering companies we saw with your Iconic IMAGINE company in the beginning of the film? Remember when we use to see just that one single IMAGINE logo before all of your other movies and there we knew we were in for a great one? Im not sure where these other band wagon companies came from but please just make sure your next movie is from IMAGINE alone or I can Imagine Ron Howard losing all his credibility for great movie making.",

Even if you're not a racing car fan..the story of friendship and rivalry is fantastic. The duo have a great chemistry in this movie.

The reality of the Hunt vs Lauda battle was a cracking story and I remember following it at the time, but most of the film left me cold - possibly because of a truly abysmal portrayal of James Hunt, but also the rather paltry amount of awfully CGI track action and the fact that every facet of the story was portrayed in a very naff stereotypical fashion. In fact were it not for a masterful performance by Daniel Brühl who really does capture some of the essence of Niki Lauda, I'd have probably scored the film a couple of points lower.

This was an excellent effort, in the portrayal of Niki Lauda's roller coaster life and fascinating Career in Formula One. It is a great insight into his rivalry with James Hunt and portrays the dangerous levels these guys took themselves to, in their efforts for success.",
432,8 February 2021,Jackblyth8,9, Easily One of the Best Sporting Films,"Highlighting the contrasting ways of life between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, 'Rush' captures the lifestyles of the two away from the wheel. James Hunt, mastered by Chris Hemsworth, is an extroverted, confident driver who dominated the racing industry in the early 1970's. Niki Lauda, played by Daniel Bruhl, is rather the opposite, introverted and reserved in his ways, he slowly becomes one of the greatest drivers of his era, creating a fierce rivalry between himself and Hunt. The film initially begins in 1976 before cutting back 6 years to 1961, where James Hunt's success in racing is expressed through the watch, victory after victory, the British driver conveys his dominance in the sport as the man to beat. He is pictured in celebration arrogant and smug, reinforced by his many sexual interactions with different women. In his home town Vienna, Austria, Lauda's approach to driving is seen as inconvenient from his father, a wealthy businessman, who ridicules him for his dream to drive at the highest level. He is outclassed in his first encounter with Hunt who wins comfortably, afterwards, an argument between the furious Lauda and the conceited Hunt breaks out, with the British driver, who derides the Austrian, leaving him aggravated in defeat. Lauda's determination and ambition to succeed is appealing, leading to Ferrari signing him. In 1974, Hunt marries Suzy Miller, a successful British model, but the marriage is shortly lived lasting only 2 years as Miller leaves Hunt to partner with actor Richard Burton in New York City. Lauda on the other hand, experiences a loving relationship with small-time model Marlene Knaus and married in 1976. Before the 1976 Formula 1 series, Hunt and his racing team fail to provide the required sponsorship deals prior to the deadline in November, leaving a vulnerable Hunt who may miss out on the season. An offer from McLaren is pounced upon by Hunt, who convinces to a reluctant racing manager Alastair Caldwell, that he will bring success to the company. It was set to be Lauda's Ferrari against Hunt's McLaren. Over the past six years, the pair had already endured in a battling rivalry, each driver having their own achievements to boast about. Setting the tone for the season, Hunt takes pole position in São Paulo, however, he crashes out allowing Lauda to start is title defence with a victory, Hunt failing even to make the podium. At the Kyalami circuit near Johannesburg, South Africa, Hunt finishes second behind the dominant Lauda. Clay Regazzoni, fellow Ferrari driver, wins race 3 with a Lauda in second. In Madrid, Hunt wins convincingly with Lauda in second, but his victory was met with disqualification with his car found to be too wide, this was overturned two months later after resulting that it was due to the expansion of the tyres during the race. Hunt misses out on the podium once again in Belgium with Lauda finding victory in race 5. In Monaco, Lauda takes a 33 point lead in the championship over Hunt and Regazzoni. Sweden saw the relentless Austrian finish third and Hunt fifth, Scheckter winning meant he went second in the points behind Lauda. Race 8 - held in France - left Lauda in despair after his engine failed, likewise with Regazzoni, allowing Hunt to win. In his home country, Hunt wins race 9 but credit went to Lauda, who finishes second despite reoccurring gearbox troubles. Race 10 was a big controversial turning point in the season, Lauda complains about the extreme weather conditions and how that will ultimately affect the track, reinforcing that there is always a 20% chance of death as a driver, and the weather is only increasing that possibility. The race goes ahead after Hunt's popularity gathered other drivers to overrule the Austrian. Lauda starts slow and loses places to others, in the second lap, he loses control at high speed due to a suspected rear suspension failure and crashes into the barriers before bouncing back onto the track and the car catching fire, Harald Ertl and Brett Lunger crashes into the car that was spreading profusely in flames, along with Arturo Merzario and Guy Edwards who stopped their cars and rescued Lauda, pulling him out the burning vehicle. Niki is sent to hospital with serious burns and is fighting for his life. Undergoing many operations, Lauda watches Hunt drive to victory in the Netherlands (race 12), closing a two point gap between himself and Lauda. Miraculously, Lauda returns for race 13 in Italy and in a pre-race press conference he is disrespected by a journalist, who asks the Austrian if he thinks his marriage can continue regarding his facial deformation, this resulted in Hunt pulling the reporter into an empty room and beating him up, standing by his fellow driver. Lauda beats Hunt and finishes in an incredible fourth place, he states to Hunt before the race that he isn't forgiving him for allowing the German GP to advance and that he in fact is to blame for the incident. James wins race 14 with Lauda slipping up, meaning the gap was just 8 points. The penultimate round in the USA sees Lauda make the podium for the first time since his absence, finishing third as Hunt finished on top spot. The final race (16th) in Japan, southwest of Tokyo beneath the intimidating Mount Fuji, the conditions similar to in West Germany, leaving Lauda nervous yet aware of the opportunity to be crowned champion. Before the race, Lauda is leading Hunt by 3 points. With rain heavily plummeting down, Hunt gets off to a great start and Lauda, who initially started the race, pulls into the pits and withdraws, stating it is too dangerous. Hunt requires at least 3 place to win the championship. Finishing the race strongly, Chris Hemsworth's character appears to finish 3rd, but the scoreboard sees him 5th, a conservative Lauda looks on as Hunt's 3rd place finished is confirmed, meaning he was F1 Champion for 1976. As Lauda exits, he tells Marlene that he has no regrets, not one. The pair are spotted later on, with Hunt heading to a weekend in Italy, accompanied by many different women, he stops by to see Lauda, mutual respect between them, they talk about that championship and as Lauda narrates over the top, he mentions that he liked Hunt, he wasn't surprised about his sudden death at the age of 45, but he liked him and that the pair were good friends. The sensational comeback story emphasises Niki Lauda's resilience and relentless nature, an adjective used by Hunt to describe him. The pair are different generically, Hunt, enjoys the luxury lifestyle that accommodates success, whereas Lauda is fixated on racing, improving, maintaining and pushing for achievements. Putting their differences aside, the two were extremely good friends and used their bitter rivalry as motivation. Bruhl captures in essence, the credibility and determination shown by Lauda in that 76 championship, likewise with Chris Hemsworth, en asphalting that Hunt was, driven by his own self ambition, if you pardon the pun. Their friendship only making their driving careers more impressive, two greats inseparable on and off the track. Two world class drivers epitomising an oxymoron. Splendid.",

Niki should stops racing but the existence of James makes him come back to the car racing. His wife, Marlene's supports and her expressions makes a deep impression.

There are so many ways this film could have faltered into B-movie and/or made-for-TV mediocrity. The premise outlined above practically screams such credentials. Peter Morgan and Ron Howard should take a bow for steering clear of obvious pitfalls and crafting something truly insightful and cathartic from this material. Like many admirers of this film, I have no interest in F1, and actually rather despise the sport as the plaything of airhead rich fools. This film works because it is a classic odd couple formula. It also has in-built drama from the life-and-death activity these men earn their crust from. Then there is that whiff of authenticity they garner from basing this on a true story. The actors inhabit their roles completely, and the sense of mutual loathing and respect is finely conveyed. The narration is slightly annoying, but bearable. Clever, insightful and engrossing.",

Polarized til' the death, Nicki Lauda and James Hurt's rivalry in this movie is amazingly well portrayed with amazing (and shocking) performances by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl. The script is amazing and I really have no complaints about the movie, whatsoever.

444,18 May 2015,dhaufrect-1,9," ""Rush"" is worth watching","""Rush"" is another cinematic success for its director, Ron Howard. It is a 2013 film written by Peter Morgan and is currently available on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. The film is just over 2 hours long, but when it was over it seemed like I had been in the cinema about 30 minutes. The film centers on the battle for the 1976 Formula 1 World Championship, and the rivalry between the Austrian ""professor"" Nikki Lauda and the British playboy James Hunt. The two are depicted as enemies, but in actual fact they were good friends who trusted and respected each other on, as well as off- track. This bit of artistic license does not spoil the film and is reasonable in order to make the battle between the two for the F1 crown more intense. The film is nicely paced. We are introduced to both characters through their own narrative and scenes that leave the watcher in no doubt as to their background and philosophy on life. The two are first seen in competition in 1970 at a Formula 3 race at Crystal Palace (where they have a coming together) and sets the scene for the rivalry throughout the film. I'm not sure if this is further artistic license. The two definitely did race each other in F3, but I am not convinced as to whether this actual incident occurred. After that we are given a whistle stop journey between 1973 (when Hunt came into F1) to 1975. We are shown the dangerous nature of F1 at the time with the Francois Cevert accident at Watkins Glen in gory detail – although this does not seem like gratuitous, but necessary to bring home just how unforgiving the sport was back then – and it truly was (of the top 12 points scorers in 1976, F1 cars were to claim 3, 1 ended up in a wheelchair and 1 had his career ended by a leg crunching crash). I gave it 9 stars.",

447,7 March 2023,mjpiro,8," In your face, non-stop, rubber-burning action that will have you hanging on to your seat until the very end!!","Rush is the kind of movie that filmmakers and audiences dream about!! I say so because it is based on a true story - the true story between Formula 1 racers Niki Lauda and James Hunt, two of the biggest names in the game in the mid 1970's. Having a movie based on reality brings authenticity to it, audiences know that at least part of the movie is real, something like their own lives making it easier to identify with some of the characters on the silver screen. What a contrast of characters we do see on the silver screen in Rush, directed by Academy Award winner Ron Howard. On one side of the coin we have Niki Lauda, played wonderfully by Daniel Bruhl who was nominated for a BAFTA Academy Award for this performance in the category of supporting actor. Lauda is, how shall I say this kindly, something of the conservative, he stays at home with his wife and does not go out and enjoy the partying lifestyle that most Formula 1 racers enjoy post race. On the flip side of that coin is James Hunt played terrifically by Thor's Chris Hemsworth. Hunt is the antithesis to Lauda, flirting with women left and right, bedding women left and right, and enjoying the lifestyle of a successful race car driver. Surprisingly both lifestyles make for good racers on track as the 1976 season showed. If you are a fan of auto racing or sports in general you will like this movie. If you are a fan of good movies you will like this movie. Secretly this movie is both a period piece (albeit a short one) and a slice of life. It's also the type of movie that will teach you valuable life lessons while entertaining you at the same time. Extraordinary writing, superb directing, excellent acting, fine music, excellent sound editing, and a great sense of fun and suspense make this an excellent film to enjoy!! 8 out of 10 stars!!",

First off, visually the movie looks great, not once did I think it was fake and the gore side of the movie is so horrifying and terrible real that when an accident happens you really feel the emotional impact of it. The whole story is very excellent, I don't know how close it is to the real life story but the it is put together and progressed forward is very well done. I didn't like how the story skipped over a lot of the races, I understand that they can't show all of them and I'm not saying they should have, they just shouldn't have just said ""Hunt wins this race"" written on the screen. The acting is really good, although some of the accents felt off to me. The characters are really were the film gets good, there is always a tension between characters that continues to grow as the characters develop further. The characters petty feud is amazing to watch, and made me feel like I wanted to pick a side but in the end couldn't decide...maybe both characters were equally as good or bad. The ending is also very satisfying, I liked how the film handled it...my dad thought it was rather sad :'(",

Shocking how they did not get some Oscars. This shows to prove the Oscar prejudice affects everyone not American. The end scene, confused my emotions, in a good way (joy, grief, pain, accomplishment, pride, glory and victory). Rivalry with respect is like a jewel in a rock; hard to find, but totally worth it. You can choose to live life to the fullest and burn out early, or take your time and live a long, safe life. the goals of the two protagonists were felt and seen, without it having to be said.

The two lead actors did their job perfectly, you can really see the time they invested to be perfect replicas of Niki Lauda and James Hunt. This is probably the most accurate movie inspired by real people, there is almost no Hollywood in this movie, and that is a good thing. I like that they didn't use only English, so you could hear actors speaking German and Italian. And a word about the music, Hans Zimmer did a brilliant job, his music fulfills the movie.

I had the toy car (hey I was only 7 years old at the time) and didn't understand motor racing but I remember that final race and to see it reconstructed here had me quite literally on the edge of my seat. This is a very fast moving (pun not intentional) film - extremely well acted, edited and directed. Ron Howard certainly has some back catalogue, but I think this is one of his best. Yes there's quite a bit of artistic licence and a poor script in places - but that doesn't matter - the events actually happened. Nikki Lauda suffered those horrific burns following that crash and James Hunt liked sex, drugs and alcohol (the former a bit too much) but they were both 70s icons and it's good to see their rivalry, their story on celluloid.

My interest in F1 has now started thanks to this marvellous film that focuses on the relentless rivalry between stars James Hunt and Niki Lauda that took place in the 70's racing scene. Ron Howard directs with energy and flair, carefully balancing flashbacks and current moments together to create a fast moving movie, plus the camera-work is something to behold, especially when focusing on close ups of car engines revving, glass being blown in the wind and rain water flicking up into the air. The stars look as good as the cars, with Chris Hemsworth delivering a performance I never thought he'd pull off, not to say he's a bad actor, he's not and he proves this playing James Hunt, Hemsworth is so unforgettable.

Here he is with stars Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Daniel Bruhl (Captain America: Civil War) in a true story about legendary Formula 1 racers James Hunt (Hemsworth), who is a playboy, and Niki Lauda (Bruhl), who is methodical and brilliant.",
473,28 October 2013,josefinavb,10, Extraordinary!!,"Flawless to every level! It was a remarkable acting from both Hemsworth and Brühl, very close to what stories about Hunt and Lauda have been told to us thru the years.... Also you can sense the decades from the vintage quality and colors. But most important you can feel the power of the cars as if you were right there on the race track and your heart literally stops a few times during the 120 minutes just to start beating fast again!! You'll end up understanding how this two amazing drivers gained each and everybody's respect and admiration both on each particular lifestyle! Very exciting, by far the best movie I've seen in a long time! Absolutely recommend to watch it especially if you're a F1 fan like me! You'll want to watch it again and again!!",

Stunning showcase of special effects, flawless screen play, and a story that Shakespeare couldn't match, OK that may have been a bit extreme, but you catch my drift. This movie is the Days Of Thunder of Formula One and the modern movie era. ",
475,7 October 2013,dsomas91,10, A must see,"This movie is not just for Formula 1 fans. Ron Howard did an amazing job making sure there was just enough Formula 1 racing, sights and sounds mixed with fantastic cinematography and a storyline to keep everyone entertained. The action, the drama, the plot, the whole thing was well put together. This is a must see movie. Daniel Bruhl was an almost exact match of Niki Lauda. So exact, it was scary. And of course there Chris Hemsworth playing the flamboyant James Hunt. Well casted. I've been waiting for this movie to premier for almost two years. It was worth the wait. Can't wait to go see it again this Friday and will definitely buy it on Blu Ray.",
476,20 June 2015,sickofenjoyingmyself,8, Gripping F1 drama based on real life rivalry,"I can't recall having watched many dramas or movies about Formula 1 and this actually surprised me with it's depth of story line and intense character rivalry based on a true story. James Hunt and Niki Lauda were polar opposites - Hunt British Formula 1's reckless playboy of the time and Lauda the methodical, determined and arrogant Austrian. Hemsworth and Bruhl delivered outstanding performances to give so much depth to the fierce rivalry that drove one another to ultimately becoming world champions. Although there are major differences we also see a singular similarity in both characters of the unnerving belief that they will be world champion. This is something that bonds them - even if they would never be friends there is an underlying respect beneath the banter. Bruhl in particular was fantastic - especially after the major accident. His performance shows how obsessive such rivalry in sport can make a person become. And he also shows how a near death experience can make a person more aware of the life around him he could have lost. Cue the repeated shots of his wife played by Alexandra Maria Lara(who outside of the main two I thought was absolutely superb in a supporting role). Lauda realised at that point he had achieved what he had wanted to achieve and nearly paid the ultimate price in trying to achieve it again. He decided he had nothing left to prove and only everything to potentially lose and left the ball in Hunt's court. Hunt delivered and achieved his ultimate goal - something that he only had to experience once to prove to himself that he could do it. The party lifestyle never stopped and sadly he was lost to the world at only 45. Rivalry can push others to go further than they ever would have. But it can also be dangerous. This drama recognises both of these factors. It can also leave a lifelong respect between those who experienced it and when it's over leave a gap that can never be filled. For me the viewer - I was left with a lasting respect for the rivalry of two polar opposite champions - who never tried to change themselves or the way they operated. Who had true inner belief that one day they would be world champions. And although it can be deemed as reckless - who had the courage to lay it all on the line and risk everything to achieve their goals.",
477,24 February 2019,Nikkifris,10, Possibly the most underrated movie ever.,"I never hear people talk about this movie. I only see it in the bins at Best Buy for $4.99. Atrocious. My boyfriend introduced me to this movie and I ended up grabbing it out of that bin to have for myself. A true story of genuine people being the best at what they do. There is nothing more inspiring. The movie is so well cast and acted, amazing score by Hans Zimmer, and Ron Howard outdid himself. There needs to be more works of art portraying inspirational stories for viewers to actually benefit from besides being entertained. If you don't care about inspiration and motivation, you will still be entertained. Hopefully, you aspire for more than wanting to be entertained.",

480,19 February 2014,tchapman977,9, F1 has never seemed so cool.,"Chris Hemsworth pulls in an immense and startling performance as the womanising ""party guy"" James Hunt. This is due to both the actors and characters changes and versatility during the film as he doesn't stay as this fun loving hot head but easily adapts to show a deeper and somewhat subtle version of the character. It is this sort of flexibility within the role that gives Hemsworth his edge and keeps you gripped to the screen during the intense scenes on and off the track.",

I could see a few awards for this role and the message underneath was excellent.Ron Howard has done it again with the biography.A sure shot winner.Recommended for all age groups,go for it.",
483,16 October 2013,rerileyjr,6, A great story with distracting picture quality and cliché racing scenes,"I love formula one racing and the story is a classic. From the very beginning I was distracted by the soft focus, shadowy dark video, and very narrow depth of field. At first I thought Ron Howard was going for a 70s video feel; like a newsreel from back in the day. But it got tiring and distracted from the story. Then I watched a recent Indy car race on TV and was swept away by the much better camera work and amazing wreck footage. It's sad to say that I can get better and higher quality camera work from my TV on a Sunday afternoon than I can by paying to see the latest Ron Howard movie. Come on Ron I know you can do better than that.",

Yes,there are some scenes with classic formula one cars from the 70's but that's all. I don't see Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt, i even don't see him as a good actor. The same with Olivia Wilde, who appears this days in every single movie they make. The only good performance was by Daniel Bruhl. There was no feeling to the story, i didn't see the world from the 70's, there was no f1 feeling, no petrol head passion, just a pale excuse of a movie. Also as far as i know the movie is not following the exact historical events from the life of this drivers, i mean in 1970 Formula 3 season. They didn't even take part in the 1970 Formula 3 Championship. Sorry but that's the way i see this work",

491,11 October 2013,maslss75,1," A great disappointment/ rent the 1966 ""Grand Prix""","The hype for this film belies the second rate racing sequences, especially the claim that one would feel as if he or she were in the cockpit of an F1 car. If you are interested in F!, I suggest that in lieu of wasting money on this film, one should either rent or buy the 1966 movie Grand Prix. That film brilliantly presented the thrill and drama of F1 in all its glory, excitement and tragedy. Grand Prix's story line is generally considered rather weak but that is a very small concession for it incredible racing sequences. John Frankenheimer was an extraordinary director who visually captured the excitement of open cockpit racing in what was truly its golden era. Ron Howard on the other hand uses a combination of slapdash racing sequences and optical effects which fail, in my estimation, to truly convey the stunning excitement of this incredible sport.",

If you ever put your life on the line in; or in my case (on a motorized vehicle: Ninja 2001); you know what this movie is all about. This movie touched me. I vaguely remember in 1976 the attention this type of racing brought to the world. I was too young to really know; but thanks to Ron Howard, now I know. Now make the sport bike movie to honor racers like me; the unsung hero's of American highways.

Or even more important, James Hunt and Niki Lauda. It's a great way for anyone who wants a glimpse into the world of F1 motor sports back in then days, with an actual story line. To see Niki Lauda walking at the Mercedes AMG Peytonas paddock's giving advise to the drivers of today is amazing. The rhythm of the movie both in thrilling moments, personal drama, and driving is combined almost perfectly. It can remind a bit of Days of Thunder, except from this being a true story, at least as far as they can go pushing an entire f1 season into one movie! Worh watching, over and over and over again, specially if you like I,miss F1 during the pre-season.",

500,5 October 2013,pslawfl,10, Best F1 Picture,"I was an avid fan of Formula One from 1961 to 1993 when I began losing interest since the sport has now degenerated into a technical exercise. The period of 1966 to 1983 was the greatest period in the history of the sport and 1976 one of its best years. So I went into the theater with another formula 1 friend. Both of us expected to be pointing our inaccuracies throughout the movie. Instead we left the theater thinking this is a great film and a true tribute to Hunt and Lauda and formula 1 in the 1970s. Yes, there were a few inaccurate moments (Hunt and Lauda actually liked each, but its more fun to make them insult each other whenever they meet), but that did not detract from the overall excellence of the movie and the fabulous photography. I'm going to see this movie again. . . . and again. By the way, you don't have to be a racing enthusiast to enjoy it; its simply a great movie.",

Being at a race and experiencing the noise and excitement of the chase is something else. Mr. Howard did an amazing job making this film. To be honest, I did not really know what to expect when going to see this film. I was very impressed with the movie in a whole. From the acting to the direction of the movie and how it was filmed. The camera angles and shots where impressive. The movie portrayed the formula 1 racing era during the 70's very well. the Movie was around 2 hours, I think. It really felt like an hour. I was on the edge of my seat for most of it. In my opinion, no scene was dragged out. the scenes were shot and they moved on with the story. I really liked that.I would gladly go see this again, and take my friends. Thanks, Mr. Howard, for another great film.",
502,4 November 2013,jackframpton,9, Exhilarating movie even if you're not a F1 fan!,"I entered Rush completely oblivious to F1, having only briefly researched the Hunt vs. Lauda rivalry a few hours before seeing it. And I must say that despite never having watched a F1 race, I found this movie extremely entertaining! After walking out of the cinema I immediately went and bought every F1 racing game I could and become obsessed with F1, researching drivers, cars and tracks, that is what this movie did to me. Bruhl and Hemsworth looked near identical to their real life counterparts and their mannerisms resemble the duo perfectly. Ron Howard rarely disappoints and this movie is no exception. Ron presents both of these larger than life men and gave them an equal playing field. You will undoubtedly find yourself rooting for one or the other throughout, supporting their every move, then somehow have your opinion switched. The race scenes are shot incredibly and deeply immerse you in the race to the point where you almost feel every turn, giving you a taste of the real danger racers put themselves in every time they put on the helmet.",
