1,31 August 2012,planktonrules,9, Creepy and engaging.,"It's rather strange that this film was a box office flop, as it's one of Alfred Hitchcock's better movies. The only problem with ""Vertigo"" is that in order to really enjoy it, you need to turn off your brain and just accept the movie. If you think the plot out TOO MUCH, you'll find yourself asking too many questions and not just enjoying the film...like my oldest daughter did.",r
2,19 July 2009,hitchcockthelegend,10, You're not lost. Mother's here.,"John ""Scottie"" Ferguson is a San Francisco cop who decides to quit the service after his acrophobia results in him being unable to save the life of a colleague. Whilst taking it easy he gets a call from an old school friend, Gavin Elster, asking him if he wouldn't mind doing a little bit of detective work for him. The job is simply to tail his wife because she's obsessed with an ancestress who committed suicide, and the wife, Madeline, is showing signs of herself being suicidal. Ferguson tails her diligently and as the tail progresses, Ferguson himself starts to become ever obsessed about the demur blonde Madeline. As the story twists and turns, Ferguson's obsession will have far reaching consequences for both parties... ",e
3,3 December 2005,bkoganbing,9, Detective Obsessed,"Although it got at best mixed reviews when first released, Vertigo is now considered one of Alfred Hitchcock's classic films. A tribute to the players, the director, and the composer of that haunting musical score that will stay with you forever.",v
4,7 February 2008,lastliberal,9, One final thing I have to do... and then I'll be free of the past.,Oscar ignored this fantastic film by Hitchcock starring James Stewart. It gave nomination for Art and Set decoration and Sound. Small acknowledgment of an outstanding film.,i
5,13 October 2013,AaronCapenBanner,9, Mesmerizing.,"Alfred Hitchcock directed this mesmerizing film that stars Jimmy Stewart as John 'Scottie' Ferguson, a retired San Francisco policeman who is approached by old college friend Gavin Elster(played by Tom Helmore) who wants him to follow his wife Madeline(played by Kim Novak) who has been acting strangely. Scottie does follow her, and becomes obsessed by her beauty and behavior, eventually falling in love with her, with devastating consequences. Though that is only the start of the mystery... Barbara Bel Geddes costars as Scottie's friend Midge, still in love with him, despite jilting him years before. Superbly directed and acted film has an ingenious story and stunning imagery, making this an unforgettable romantic mystery, with a stunning ending...though if you have the DVD, watch the extra feature on the lost extended ending, which is fascinating, and changes the tone of the film as a result!",e
6,12 October 2008,rmax304823,8, Only the most shallow man would fail to be impressed by appearances.,"""Vertigo"" is considered Hitchcock's masterpiece by high-brows and viewed as a slow, dull movie by proletarians. Indulge this Olympian generalizations for a moment. ",w
7,1 March 2018,JohnHowardReid,10, A masterpiece of nightmarish excitement!,"At the time of Vertigo's release, very few critics commented upon Bernard Herrmann's powerful music score which contributes so greatly to the movie's overall mood, atmosphere and almost unnerving suspense. ",/
8,12 August 2001,dbdumonteil,10, Among the very best.,"In Boileau-Narcejac's French novel ""D'Entre les Morts""= from among the Dead""),the revelation only comes in the last pages,but Hitchcock lets the cat out of the bag long before the end. Boileau-Narcejac's novel is a pure detective story,but the Master wanted more:the movie already outdistances the book in a first part visually wonderful,with memorable scenes,wrapped in mystery ,such as the one with the sequoia,symbol of immortality or the one down by the sea,to rival with the best romantic movies of all time.In the second part,Hitchcock explains in the Truffaut's book,we know but Scottie( James Stewart) does not .And he tries to recreate a dead woman,to transform Judy into Madeleine.This folie à deux ends where the first tragedy occurred ,which gives the movie a strength that the book had not.Read it and you'll realize how its end ,speaking in terms of cinema,had to be modified for the screen.That's Hitchcock's genius.",r
9,13 August 2016,ThomasDrufke,10," Karma, Deception, and Obsession.","Alfred Hitchcock wowed audiences for decades with an immense talent of deception and artistic flare, and perhaps no movie was a better showcase for those talents than his 1958 hit Vertigo. An impressive tale about obsession.",w
10,21 November 2009,AlsExGal,10, This film takes repeated viewings to really appreciate it...,... and perhaps that is why it bombed upon initial release.,5
11,13 February 2000,Quinoa1984,10," Favorite Hitchcock and likely one of the most challenging, harrowing great films ever","Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is probably his most discussed film, and I believe that since it is so controversial- and yet living up to such hype by having a level of mystery, daring and true human interest that is open to interpretation- it gets better with every passing year. It deserves more credit than it gets (like most of Hitchcock's films) and though it is well credited with it's intrigue, I think that Psycho (not that it is a bad film) gets more credit than this film should get. There are at least a few reasons for this, arguably of course. One, the acting is spectacular including James Stewart in one of his very best turns as the weary, emotionally perplexed and obsessed cop with a slight fear of heights and a 'thing' for a certain 'dead' woman. Hitchcock's leading lady here Kim Novak, is equally interesting and ambiguous as the leading lady (or ladies). ",2
12,24 November 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10," A thriller of undeniable complexity, and impeccably acted and directed-Hitchcock's masterpiece!","I am a massive Hitchcock fan; this great director ain't called the Master of Suspense for nothing. Anyway, Vertigo is one of the truly great Hitchcocks. It is a thriller of undeniable complexity not only in plot but also in characterisation. It is implausible too i give you that. I will admit the first time I saw this, I didn't understand this, then again this is the sort of film that you need to see more than once. In all departments, this movie is a masterpiece and my all time favourite Hitchcock. For those who say this is the worst movie ever, you would beg to differ if you saw genuine crapfests like Disaster Movie, Home Alone 4, NeverEnding Story 3 and Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2. They are a trillion times worse than this without a shadow of a doubt.",7

His life changes when he accepts to watch a woman at the request of her husband, who suspects that his wife has been visited by a ghost. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, has script Alec Coppel and Samuel A. Taylor, with the participation of James Stewart and Kim Novak.",2
14,26 September 2013,BA_Harrison,5, I love Hitchcock but...,"Although often regarded as one of Hitchcock's finest thrillers, Vertigo failed to impress me as much as I had hoped. There are the expected Hitchcock visual flourishes (plus one really trippy scene that is downright freaky), the dreamlike score by Bernard Hermann is suitably eerie, and Barbara Bel Geddes plays a fun character, but most other aspects of this so-called classic left me cold.",2
15,17 February 2000,krumski,5," SPOILERS GALORE! If you've never seen the movie, DON'T READ this review!","I suppose this is some kind of masterpiece, what with the absolutely overwhelming photography, powerful score and all - but I must say I just couldn't get into it. We're made to be patient through a looooong exposition (Scottie following her around), which I didn't mind at first because I said, ""Hey it's Hitchcock - the payoff will be worth it."" Well, it wasn't. Scottie's obsession was inexplicable to me (and, yes, I realize that Kim Novak is hot); maybe the writing was weak in not giving him a strong and clear enough motivation for going over the edge (what were his other romantic attachments like? Why is *this* one in particular so extremely excessive? Knowing these things would help) or maybe it's just that I can't buy Jimmy Stewart in this type of role. He projects too much groundedness, dignity and common sense for him to be convincing as this kind of obsessional basket case (the scene with him in the asylum was particularly embarrassing and unconvincing; he doesn't look ""crazy"" - he looks like Jimmy Stewart just refusing to say his lines). Maybe an actor a bit more rumpled and on the edge - Robert Mitchum, say - could have brought the part off better (and I'm a *huge* Jimmy Stewart fan, just so you don't get the wrong idea).",6
16,5 May 1999,Hitchcoc,10, Makes the Brain Spin,"Having experienced vertigo myself, the dizzying, confusing, frightening mind spinning, ""think you're going to die"" kind of feeling, I can empathize with the Jimmie Stewart protagonist.  Make him a hero who has enough hangups from trauma to last a lifetime.  Put into the plot a series of misrepresentations of fact and you have this movie.  I think what I like the most is that we have this man trying to put his life together, but he doesn't know what to do to make it work.  He also is deep in depression, caused by personal loss. Along comes Kim Novak, the carbon copy of his lost love.  He falls into a sick reconstruction of his past life, but the fear is still there and won't go away until he is able to confront his ghosts.  Once again, the Hitchcock hero fumbles his way along, trying to discover while being pursued.  There is that threat there all the time.  The cinematography is excellent.  The method used to show the feeling he gets when he looks down, is pure genius. The framing of scenes. The stairway in the tower. The scenes by the bay. Novak's ""coming out"" is really spooky, so captivating and yet unsettling. The true test of a movie, for me, is always going to be that there is something to see after several viewings.  Hitchcock's films, especially the really good ones, allow me a lifetime of rediscovery; I feel that directors like Hitchcock are a gift to humanity.  This film is one of the reasons I feel this way.",0
17,5 December 2009,claudio_carvalho,10, A Masterpiece of Obsession,"While pursuing a criminal on the roofs of the buildings in San Francisco, Detective John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (James Stewart) has a severe trauma when his partner falls off the roof trying to save him. He suffers from acrofobia and is retired from the police force, since his fear of heights provokes vertigo on him. He is contacted by the former mate from college Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), who runs the shipyard of his wife Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak), and Gavin asks him to follow his wife. Gavin explains that she has an odd behavior and seems to be possessed by the spirit of Carlotta Valdes, having blanks of memory every now and then and presenting suicidal tendencies. The skeptical Scottie follows the beautiful blonde on the next morning: she buys some flowers and is drawn to places from the past related to Carlotta Valdes, visiting her grave in an ancient cemetery; staring her portrait for a long time in a museum; and finally moving to the Hotel McKittrick where Carlotta lived. In the end of the day, Scottie reports his findings to Gavin. When Madeleine jumps in the water of San Francisco Bay, Scottie rescues her and brings her home. He has a crush on her and they fall in love for each other. When they go together to a mission outside San Francisco, Madeleine runs to the bell tower of the church and the disabled Scottie is unable to reach her; she jumps off the tower, committing suicide. There is a trial and the traumatized Scottie is interned with a breakdown. When he is discharged from the hospital, he meets the brunet seller Judy Barton by chance and her resemblance with Madeleine is amazing. Scottie approaches to Judy and expect to have a second chance in love until he sees a souvenir of a killing. ",/

20,12 September 2006,evanston_dad,9," Accomplished If Not ""Fun"" Hitchcock Drama","Considered by many to be Hitchcock's masterpiece, ""Vertigo"" may be tough to warm up to on a first viewing. It's an enigmatic and extremely slow-moving film, and it feels personal in ways that many of Hitchcock's other, more playful movies don't. You get the sense that Hitch is working through his personal demons on screen -- the fetishes and obsessions that played such a major role in so many of his films leading up to ""Vertigo"" feel like characters in and of themselves here.",e
21,7 September 2005,moonspinner55,9, From among the dead...,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" has a narcotizing effect, a lulling, dream-like ambiance that is hard to shake off, which may explain why many viewers keep returning to it. It's also a strangely muted and anticlimactic film, posing yet another possible reason moviegoers watch it repeatedly: they hope (or need) to get more out of it the third or fourth time. Retired police detective James Stewart meets and makes over a woman who reminds him of his only true love--a suicidal woman he lost, but perhaps can find again by dipping back into the past. Hitchcock seemed to relate to Stewart's ""Scottie"" moreso than any other character in his films, and--having a gleeful touch of nastiness himself--is careful not to let him have his way. Glamour-mystery is gorgeous to take in, fascinatingly written and well-acted. Only one question: is the hotel manager (Ellen Corby) part of the scheme or just a dotty old broad? ***1/2 from ****",f

23,23 November 2006,Steffi_P,10," ""That is a matter between him and his own conscience""","Perhaps the most significant thing about this masterpiece from Alfred Hitchcock is that it is the film which broke Jimmy Stewart. Hitchcock took the ultimate nice guy, the honest, likable everyman of heart-warming Frank Capra romantic comedies and gradually turned him into an obsessive, mentally deranged control freak. A very deliberate stroke of genius in casting, but it is only one of many things that make this an incredible picture.",=
24,1 August 2014,PWNYCNY,10, This movie is great.,"This movie features incredibly powerful acting by the two stars, James Stewart and Kim Novak. In fact, this story is so actor-driven that it is unlikely that with different actors the movie would have been as nearly as powerful. Stewart plays a character, Scotty, who is being cruelly manipulated by two people for ulterior purposes that become apparent only later in the movie. What drives the story forward is the interaction between Scotty and the woman, Madeleine, whose deviousness is only matched by her own emotional vulnerability. Emotions become confused as victim and manipulator become more involved. Besides being arguably James Stewart's most emotionally evocative performance, it propels the movie to a dramatic crescendo that is completely engaging. It is virtually impossible for an audience not to empathize with Scotty's emotional torment. Yet, what makes the movie even more provocative is the way in which the two characters are portrayed - as people with whom one can identify. Scotty and Madeleine are plausible characters. Without going into detail, suffice it that Kim Novak gives the best performance of her career. The cinematography is excellent. This is a great movie.",t
25,29 April 2004,rbrb,10, The Dizzy Heights of Excellence,"Retired detective, who is scared of heights, is hired to follow another mans wife and there follows intrigue, mystery and suspense. A super melodrama! The acting,directing, sets, costumes, script, music, etc are all excellent. And near the start of the film there is one brilliant 10 minute period when there is no dialogue but the action is controlled only by the music. A sensational analysis of the movie is by Roger Ebert: see external reviews. This picture is worthy of maximum marks.",t
26,28 December 2018,eveflower1970,9, Beautifully Twisted,"Two years before Hitchcock's legendary horror movie ""Psycho"" (1960) hit the theaters, our Alfred stunned audiences with another masterpiece.

29,17 August 2015,g-bodyl,9, Keeps You In Suspense!,"Vertigo is the first Alfred Hitchcock film I have experienced and that is one of the many reasons why the film will stick to my heart forever. I was surprised how this film received mixed reviews when originally released, but I guess the contemporary audience was not ready for him just yet. This film fits the definition of a mystery, but it is much deeper than that. It's a love story, and a painful one to boot. The love expressed here is desirable, but also painful, yearning, and something that can be hard to watch. That is what makes this movie a classic and one of Hitchcock's best movies in a long line of memorable, successful movies. I really enjoyed the film and the dark attributes it possesses. ",v
30,14 December 2017,yocarlosvarelapr,10, A Classic is a Classic,"There are no accidents here. Next year, in a few weeks, Vertigo will be 60 years old and it will celebrate it on top of the list of The Greatest Films Ever Made overtaking Citizen Kane and many other masterpieces. Why? Maybe when a filmmaker of Hitchcock's greatness taps into his own unconscious and reveals himself. By now we know enough about Hitchcock the man to know he was obsessed in finding that woman who'll look and behave just the way he wants and once he find them, they are destroyed to then embark on a quest to replace or duplicate her. Vera Miles was suppose to be the object of James Stewart's obsession and she opted for motherhood instead. Kim Novak replaced her and her coldness and detachment worked beautifully here. Barbara Bel Geddes the real woman who loves him he doesn't even notice, his focus is in the impossible.The magic touch in Vertigo is truly Bernard Herrmann. Try to see Vertigo without the score. No, don't. This classic is a marriage of images and music. A thriller with an uncomfortable truth at its very center. A personal truth from its filmmaker. I don't know if Vertigo will still be the number 1 in the list a hundred years from now, I will never know but I suspect that it will always be among the top.",

33,7 August 2007,barnabyrudge,9, Fine puzzler from Hitchcock.,"The initial critical verdict of Vertigo was that it was not one of Alfred Hitchcock's better films. Time has turned it into his most analyzed and revisited movie and, in the eyes of many, his masterpiece. I still don't subscribe to the opinion that this is Hitchcock's greatest film (give me The Thirty Nine Steps, Foreign Correspondent or North By Northwest) but it is certainly a wonderfully absorbing mystery, and the original indifference that greeted the film from critics and audiences was totally unjust. It takes multiple viewings to fully appreciate what Hitchcock is up to in this movie - it is a sophisticated and multi-layered film that grows in stature the more times you view it.",

According to Elster, Madeleine may have become possessed by the spirit of her great-grandmother Carlotta Valdes, a society beauty who committed suicide at the age of 26 when she was abandoned by her lover. Madeleine herself is now 26, and Elster fears that she may meet the same fate.",
37,28 July 2017,gbill-74877,9, Wonderfully disturbing,"What a wonderful, creepy, beautiful, disturbing film this is. From the opening credits, Hitchcock makes us uneasy with spiraling patterns on the screen, which hints at the vertigo/acrophobia to follow, but what we find are so many other disturbances and twists of the mind: obsession, guilt, insanity, and manipulation. There is creepy sexual desire, and what self-abasing lengths a woman will go to do what 'does it' for a man. Jimmy Stewart turns in a great performance, but as a nitpick, he's twice the age of Kim Novak (50 and 25), and also looks too old to have gone to college with his sidekick Barbara Bel Geddes (who's great by the way). The film takes place in absolutely gorgeous scenery in San Francisco, Muir Woods and Mission San Juan Bautista, and it's at once both dream-like and nightmarish. It feels like a quiet movie with its pace and small cast, but there is tension and mystery throughout. There are several stunning moments, which I won't spoil, and the ending is absolutely brilliant. Hitchcock's delving into dark places of the mind, his storytelling, and his camera angles, are all superlative. Excellent film.",
38,2 March 2011,valleyjohn,4, Hitchcock's masterpiece? Never,"In a year when there has been some odd films , films that are not easy to explain ( Shutter Island , Black Swan , Inception etc..) , i thought i was on safe ground watching a good old fashioned Alfred Hitchcock thriller but little did i know this is just as unexplainable as any of those films i have named . Vertigo is sometimes called "" Hitchcock's masterpiece"" but i don't see it. This is a long ponderous movie that makes very little sense and treats the viewer with contempt. Jimmy Stewart is watchable but his character is not very believable and the relationship with Kim Novak is confusing and annoying. I much prefer Rear Window or Psycho to this movie and to be perfectly honest i couldn't wait for it to finish.",
39,9 January 2008,dead47548,10, Superb!,"Let me start by saying that the twist is one of the most original, shocking and simply intelligent that I've ever seen on film. I was completely stunned when it was revealed, and I can only think of one or two other occasions of me being shocked remotely by a twist. Hitchcock has a rare ability to have the film run 15 full minutes with no dialogue, yet it remains just as/if not more engaging as any action filled bloodfest we see today. My eyes became completely glued to the screen as I became just as obsessed with discovering the truth behind the mystery as Scottie was. As Lynch does in Blue Velvet, Hitchcock uses the theme of voyeurism throughout yet instead of making it perverse and disgusting he somehow makes the act feel completely natural and almost comfortable; it's just like a second nature.",
40,10 July 2002,james.king@optusnet.com.au,10, A Standard Rave,"Starting in 1958, Alfred Hitchcock directed a remarkable sequence of films in a row, each of them a classic; Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). Never has a director made four such genuinely great movies in such a short space of time, either before or since.",
41,3 December 1999,Reviewer,10, Did everyone notice the second plot twist!!!?????,"Vertigo is the greatest movie ever made. The acting, drama, set design, lighting, plot and script are first class. This movie was robbed of the Oscars in 1958! However I'm not going to describe the movie as it MUST be seen. But for those who have seen it did you notice the second more subtle plot twist? It occurs after the scene when Scottie is in the hospital suffering from a mental breakdown. Notice how Midge does not appear in the movie again! In fact, the second half of the movie after that point, we are actually seeing what is going through Scottie's head and how he copes with his circumstances. Notice also that when the main Jury person is speaking he says that Scottie's previous weakness made the policeman fall to his death. You see Scottie comes to terms with his personal disasters by assuming the role of the person he could not save. What I mean is that it was the policeman who was hanging from the roof in reality but Scottie could not save him because he was looking down at the officer. He later reverses roles with Mrs Madeline Elster after the hospital scene. Now tell me how much of a genius Hitchcock really was!",
42,10 June 2015,anaconda-40658,9, Going Up!,"Vertigo (1958): Dir: Alfred Hitchcock / Cast: James Stewart, Kim Novak, Tom Helmore, Barbara Bel Geddes, Henry Jones: Spellbinding thriller about mysterious unknowns and romance that spirals out of control. James Stewart plays an ex detective who fears heights but summoned by an old college friend to investigate the strange behaviour of his wife. What follows is obsession as Stewart grows closer to his subject until tragedy hits and overwhelming facts surface. Director Alfred Hitchcock begins in noir fashion then ventures into romance and suspense, but the third act reveals a complete turn of events as Stewart attempts to create what was deemed lost. This is Stewart's fourth film for Hitchcock and he plays John Ferguson with the need to conquer his trauma and restore his loss. Kim Novak is fantastic in duo roles playing the fearfully paralyzed and the subject of restoration. Tom Helmore has a pivotal role but unfortunately he is way too obvious as Novak's husband. We never trust him, which subtracts elements where a more trusting type might render more a surprise. Perhaps casting an actor who doesn't scream guilty the moment he appears on screen would have helped. Nonetheless the role is detailed and sufficient. Barbara Bel Geddes steals scenes as Stewart's refuge who stands by despite misdirected affections. Tremendous visual achievement about trauma and obsession. Score: 9 ½ / 10",

Coincidentally, I'd watched the movie for the first time myself a few days before hand, so I was in a perfect position to evaluate their judgment. And I think they're wrong...dead wrong. For me, VERTIGO isn't even the best Hitchcock movie. I can think of plenty of others that I enjoyed movie: FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (1956 version), DIAL M FOR MURDER, PSYCHO, FRENZY, THE BIRDS, REAR WINDOW, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, tjhe list is endless.

49,18 February 2006,EUyeshima,10, Obsession as Grand Melodrama in Hitchcock's Most Hypnotic Work,"This legendary 1958 masterwork from Alfred Hitchcock plays like grand Baroque opera full of exaggerated character motivations and preposterous plot turns, yet it is one of the most consistently involving of his impressive canon of films perhaps because he takes an unsavory subject, sexual obsession, and shapes around it a remarkably perceptive character-driven mystery thriller. Co-written with intricacy by Alec Coppel and Samuel A.

50,10 December 2014,ags123,10, Beautiful,"Once you've seen ""Vertigo"" you can almost see the whole thing again in your head. Its haunting images stay with you. Whatever else you might say about ""Vertigo,"" (and there are those who don't like it), it's unquestionably a visually beautiful film. It formed my impressions of San Francisco, and when I finally visited that city, it all seemed so familiar. In fact, many of the locations remain unchanged after more than fifty years - Mission Dolores, The Brocklebank Apartments, The Legion of Honor, The Palace of Fine Arts, Fort Point. You can even stay in the same Sutter Street hotel where ""Judy"" lived (The Empire Hotel is now the Hotel Vertigo). If I can find fault at all with this film, I point to James Stewart who, despite a great performance, looks too old for the part and his chemistry with Kim Novak is dubious (Much better in their other 1958 outing, ""Bell, Book and Candle""). When ""Vertigo"" failed at the box office on its initial release, Hitchcock is said to have blamed it on Stewart, and I tend to believe it. After four films together, he never used him again. Nevertheless, ""Vertigo"" entertains on many levels. I don't even mind the unexplained and illogical sequences (Madeleine waking up nude in Scottie's bed and neither one of them making an issue of it; her disappearance from The McKittrick Hotel). And I'm impressed by the downbeat and abrupt ending, which surely was unusual for a Hollywood film at that time. ""Vertigo"" is in a class by itself.",
51,8 July 2005,GOWBTW,9, Very Intense!,"This is not bad for a 50's movie. Especially if it's from Alfred Hitchcock. The beginning of the movie didn't look like anything from that era. I mean, the title and the background effects, it looked more scientific to any era. The affects of a phobia always impairs a person's work. And conquering them shouldn't be a problem. But if the person has ""Vertigo"", like the main character, conquering the fearing always have drawbacks. Scottie Fergerson(James Stewart) has vertigo and the fear of heights, that effected his work and cost a police officer's life. The guilt haunts him. Midge Woods(Barbara Bel Geddes, before DALLAS), is a designer and painter who seems to be the stronger characters in the movie. I thought is was funny when she painted the picture of the sitter with her likeness in it. For Scottie, he was not amused. SHAME ON YOU, SCOTTIE! However, the obsession made him too obsessed on finding out the mystery woman he's tailing. The woman(Kim Novak) was somehow just a pawn instead of the culprit when Scottie's friend hired him to look out. Guilt followed him again when she jumped off the roof, or so it seemed. The real pawn in the movie was Scottie himself. His own friend took advantage of his condition, and try to make him feel guilty again. Conquering the fear of heights is not easy, only if you let it persist. Like the old saying, The only thing you have to fear its fear itself. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.",

To keep the audience from feeling cheated, then, some movies will be ambiguous as to whether what we are seeing is reality or a dream, and this is the case with ""Vertigo."" The movie begins with a close-up of a woman's face. The camera moves in even closer on her eye, in which we begin to see swirling animation along with the opening credits. Moving into her eye suggests that we have moved into her subjective state, allowing us to see what she is imagining or remembering.

Due to his newly acquired acrophobia, he retires and wanders around the beautiful streets of San Francisco. Out of the blue, an old college friend Gavin Elster asks him to follow his wife Madeleine, as he believes that Madeleine may be possessed by the spirit of her great-grandmother, drifting in and out of reality and into trance-like states of mind. So Scottie agrees to follow the mysterious blonde (Kim Novak) as Hitchock guides us throughout San Francisco and into his strange and dark mind. Little by little, Scottie begins to become infatuated with Madeleine, and after he saves her from suicide (she jumped into San Francisco Bay) and decides to help her, he falls madly in love with her. In finding pieces of the puzzle to Madeleine's mystery, their journey takes them to the San Juan Bautista where Madeleine meets her end by tumbling off the bell tower, presumably by suicide. Scottie tried to save his love but his fear of heights stopped him. For the next year Scottie falls into a deep depression, feeling guilty for his impotency to save his love. His depression is halted when he sees Judy Barton (Novak again). Judy isn't like Madeleine--she's plain, in touch with reality and even vulgar when compared.

Which is why Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" is such a breath of fresh air.  Here is a subtle, suspensful, mezmerising tale told with the patience and sure handedness of a true artist.  At it's heart Vertigo is a tale of deception and obsession.  After the brilliantly exciting opening sequence (which has been ripped off countless times, like much of Al's catalogue) the movie slows down to a steady, almost frustrating pace.  It's main theme develops only gradually, allowing the viewer to soak in every tiny detail of character development. I fear, however, that this film may be too subtle and cerebral for most of today's action obsessed movie buffs, but for those viewers with a little bit of patience and just a drop of thoughtfulness, ""Vertigo"" will prove a very rewarding experience.",

Vertigo is one of his most celebrated films, even though it's modeled after Rebecca in that it's 3 films rolled into one: a love story, a metaphysical thriller, and a suspense drama. Nevertheless, the difference between the Hitchcock of 1940 and the Hitchcock of 1958 is vast. The Hitchcock of Vertigo is a much more elaborate director, that dwells on the human psyche to fill the canvas. The human psyche is the protagonist, the suspense is just the background, or even a detail. Vertigo is a major work and an essay on neurosis and repressed desire.",

71,23 March 2006,paul2001sw-1,3, No towering achievement,"Alfred Hitchcock has a reputation as one of the outstanding film-makers of his era; but to a modern viewer, 'Vertigo' disappoints. The plotting is as torturous as any modern thriller, but the 1950 production values continually let it down: one grows tired of out-of-doors scenes transparently shot in the studio (and even the scenes actually shot on location are curiously devoid of passers-by), there's a very clumsy (though admittedly innovative) dream sequence, even the fact that the two leads are unable to even kiss each other properly starts to grate after a while. This might suggest that Hitchcock's only failing with this movie was over-ambition, but unfortunately, it isn't so: for he also fails to get decent performances from his leading actors, stiff-as-a-board Jimmy Stweart and icy Kim Novak (a typical Hitchcock blonde) generate absolutely no on-screen chemistry. And both have complex roles to play: one of them undergoes a kind of nervous breakdown, while the other simulates the same thing; but neither can play their roles with sufficient depth to make this story work as psychological melodrama. There is one interesting female character - played by Barbara Bel Geddes - but she is mysteriously written out half way though for no good reason. Compare the performances in this movie to those being put in by the likes of Marlon Brando or Orson Welles at the same period in time, and one has to pass harsh judgement. There are still a few interesting details: it's amazing how little dialogue Hitchcock dares get away with, and the very bleak ending is surprising for a mainstream film. But it's impossible to invest any emotional feeling in the story; and that's surprising, given Hitchcock's towering legend.",

The first time I watched it, I had no idea how it would end, and what would become of Scotty and Madeleine.

74,23 February 2008,arthera09,9, everything one would expect from Hitchcock,"The only reason I do not give this movie a 10 is kind of the same reason why I did not give the graduate a 10. It is because the love story felt totally uninspired. Maybe they also kissed differently back then, but when Scotty kisses Judy when she dresses up like Madaline again it does not seem very passionate. Other than that the movie was amazing. I don't think I have seen the lighting trick in any other movie used as effectively as in this movie. When Scotty is learning about the history of Carlotta and the scene just gets dark is a great scene. Somehow the story seems like a standard affair in terms of plots for modern movies, but Hitchcock manages to make it an edge of your seat thriller. Jimmy Stewart did an amazing job as allows and the end it seems as if he just may have it in him to kill Judy. He manages to shed his nice guy persona and is downright scary. There is nothing better than watching a classic film and seeing where the greats get their motivation for making great movies. I have to say that I did love the dream sequence and the look in his face is possibly one of the best reaction shots to a dream. I do not know why movies are just not better written now a days. There was some quick dialog that you do not get in movies like this. It is hard to imagine not falling in love the type of characters that Jimmy Stewart portrays because they just don't make actors like him anymore. If you gave him the lines all you needed to do was put a camera on him. I also liked how they did not show what happened after Judy killed herself because I would like to think of him falling back into despair, but the fact that it is left up to the viewer shows a level of respect to the viewer that one does not see anymore. Jimmy Stewarts up and downs in the movie could not have been done better and seeing him in his most pathetic is really a testament of how good of an actor he is.

It's hard to believe now, but when I was younger, I used to have a love/hate relationship with Alfred Hitchcock's classic romantic psychological thriller VERTIGO. I loved its suspense, moving performances, haunting love story, dreamlike quality, and poignant yet powerful Bernard Herrmann score -- so why did it take me years to embrace VERTIGO as wholeheartedly as our beleaguered hero John ""Scottie"" Ferguson embraces his beloved Madeleine Elster? James Stewart plays Scottie, a former police detective who finds out the hard way that he has acrophobia (fear of heights, to us laypeople) when he can't save a patrolman from falling to his death during a rooftop chase. Since VERTIGO is a Hitchcock movie, what better place for our hero to live and wrestle with his phobia than San Francisco? While working on a cantilever bra invented by an engineer (nice work if you can get it!), Scottie's gal pal, designer Midge Wood (wry scene-stealer Barbara Bel Geddes) tries to help him overcome his fear gradually with stepladders (""I look up, I look down...""). Too bad the ladders happen to be next to Midge's high-rise apartment's window. Poor guy, it's always something! Scottie's old college chum Gavin Elster (suave Tom Helmore) offers him a private investigator job tailing his lovely but troubled young wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak in her finest and most challenging performance). Seems that Madeleine -- one of the coolest and most elegant of the director's legendary ""Hitchcock blondes"" -- thinks she's possessed by the spirit of her late great-grandmother Carlotta Valdes, and is behaving accordingly. Scottie tails Madeleine all over San Francisco to the places where the tragic Carlotta lived, loved, and went mad after her sugar daddy ""threw her away"" and kept their love child.

But I'll go ahead and offer up what the film seems to say to me, without fear of repetition or hope of originality because there may simply be no uncharted territory where this film is concerned.",
96,2 November 2016,oOoBarracuda,8, Vertigo,"In 2012, Sight and Sound dethroned Citizen Kane as the best film of all time, ending a 50-year reign as the top film. The film in which they named the best film, was Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo. Made in 1958 starring James Stewart and Kim Novak; I was really looking forward to seeing what so many thought was a superior film to the god-like Citizen Kane masterpiece. Vertigo explores obsession and how deeply obsession can take root and the disastrous effects that can have on everyone involved. When a retired San Fransisco detective is asked to do a favor for a friend, and obsession takes root, lives are changed forever. ",

I read somewhere that it was a flop when it came out but later became recognized as a classic. Apparently Alfred Hitchcock blamed James Stewart's being too old for the part. The two never worked together again. Well, Stewart wasn't the problem. The problem was the script, which is simply asinine. The public was right the first time: the movie is terrible.",
98,1 August 2017,Lord_Borrington,9, Surreal masterpiece,"Not very popular with critics or audiences when it first came out, probably not what they were expecting form the master director. Certainly a very different movie not in the usual Hitchcock formula. The movie probably needs more than one viewing. I can understand why some people don't like it much, but if you can get into the mood and atmosphere it's a surreal masterpiece. The movie is really about creating a surreal dreamlike world to enter. Set in San Francisco in 1958 it is like nothing before or since. Unforgettable and mesmerizing it is full of great locations, strange characters and stories. We go on a strange uneasy journey with Jimmy Stewart where there is no return and end up somewhere between sanity and insanity. Everything about this movie goes together to create another world which you feel like you have entered, the music, the 1950s grainy film, the dull colours, the incredibly shot locations, the changing light. It is certainly a strange movie hard to put into a box. It is from another time. Amazing. Like a dream... A classic film from the golden age of Hollywood. A Hollywood which doesn't exist anymore. There is just something about this movie, which you can't put your finger on. It's full of secrets.",

And Jimmy falling in love with Kim shortly after meeting her is both unethical and unbelievable. Afterall, he was hired by HER husband to follow her.

102,10 August 2015,brchthethird,10," For me, the perfect Hitchcock film","I like to be in a good frame of mind when starting a film, because if distracted, it will affect the way I process it. So, after a few false starts, I finally have seen VERTIGO, and what I feel to be the perfect example of a Hitchcock film. The story follows John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, a retired San Francisco detective who is called by a friend to follow his wife. Along the way, he falls in love and has some curious experiences revolving around mistaken identity and his fear of heights. Dare I say that James Stewart hasn't been better (at least in a Hitchcock film) than here. Kim Novak also acquits herself rather nicely in the typical Hitchcock blonde role, although I still think Grace Kelly is a slightly better actress. All of Hitchcock's tricks are put to full use here, and things start off brilliantly with my favorite title sequence so far. Saul Bass and Bernard Herrmann were two of Hitch's greatest collaborators, and they certainly did some of their best work here. From a story perspective, the narrative takes a number of twists and turns which a discerning viewer will probably figure out beforehand, but its the execution of said twists that really make them work. They aren't telegraphed, but rather are hinted at or suggested. And if there's anything that makes a Hitchcock film extremely watchable, is how he is able to manipulate audience expectations through the power of suggestion. From a technical perspective, there was quite a bit of impressive camera-work and photographic effects that add to a sense of disorientation and suspense. In particular, there are a few zoom in/track out shots that visually illustrate James Stewart's character's acrophobia. There was also a really trippy dream sequence that served as a nice reprise of the opening title sequence. Even the production design, sets, costumes, etc. added to the visual splendor. Even when the narrative slows down (to ease the tension), there's always something beautiful to look at, be it a person or one of the many on-location shots of downtown San Francisco. And finally, Bernard Herrmann's score was pretty much perfect, helping to build tension at the right moments and backing off when necessary. A couple key moments in the film happen sans score, and the mark of a good composer is knowing which moments to back off and let the drama speak for itself. Put together, all of the various production elements form a package which, to me, is the epitome of what Hitchcock brought to cinema. You have interesting (and attractive) characters, a suspense-filled story, brilliant camera-work and a rapturous score. Even the ending this time felt better than in his other films. Although it would probably benefit someone new to Hitchcock to start with something earlier in his filmography (to get a sense of progression), VERTIGO is probably the pinnacle of his style and certainly essential when it comes to film classics.",

Check the papers for revival houses in your area where old films from Hollywood's ""Golden Age"" can truly be revered.  The opening title sequence, one of the best in cinema history created by the immortal Saul Bass (NORTH BY NORTHWEST, CAPE FEAR), seemed entirely new to me in the darkened theatre.  Hitch made his most artistic picture with wondrous color schemes and amazing screen composition.  Just look at the ghostly greens and reds that help this complex tale absorb you and engage you.

Some people complain it is slow but really it is not it is just we are now used to being fed movie of a faster pace full of fast cuts. But what we have here is a fantastic study of Hitchcock's of obsession and misogyny. Where all the characters are given room to breath. It is not good to give away too much of the plot or that can relatively spoil the movie on a first viewing. The film is basically the study of one man John 'Scottie' Ferguson's obsession with one woman. The surrounding plot is really secondary to that (Hitchock's famous McGuffin). James Stewart is on magnificent form here (there really is no modern actor who could play his everyman role so well). The way each and every shot is shaped and crafted here is truly great, and we also get something which you rarely see in films these days, scenes with no little to no dialogue where the image tells the story, and here this is used superbly. From the fantastic Saul Bass opening credits through to the final shot everything here is right. The only week point being Kim Novak who I do not think is that great an actor, but apart from that the only other part of any other size is Barbara Del Geddes who is very good as Madge. We have some almost psychedelic effects shots from Hitchock to add to the deepening sense of paranoia that culminates in a great suspenseful finale. Superb to be enjoyed time and time again.",

I doubt that I was even a teenager when, one evening, this was on TV. It had me compelled throughout, and the conclusion, well, perfection itself. Needless to say, I did not sleep well that night. I'm now 23, and I finally got a copy of it. As Leonard Maltin put it, this demands multiple viewings; there is too much to take in all at once. This is a psychological thriller about love and obsession. Hitchcock delivers a layered and personal picture(and what may be his best, this or Psycho), and not only do we find ourselves wondering and following this intently, we become as ensnared as Scottie and Alfred. We can neither entirely distance ourselves from it nor condone it. Novak truly is *stunning*, and her performance is very good. Yes, there is an age difference, but they are great together. It is an unusual role for Stewart; this increases the effect, and he is rather convincing. There is suspense(he definitely was the master) and tension right from the opening credits(!). The lighting and sets are amazing, and there are several unforgettable visuals, if the editing and cinematography of this isn't overall as memorable as others by the same director. Dialog is clever, well-delivered and funny when it means to be. The score is powerful, with a little supernatural touch to it, for self-explanatory reasons. Pace is gradual. The plot is well-written, if it doesn't hold up to close scrutiny; this is about the select few characters. There is a bit of disturbing content in this. The DVD comes with an informational commentary track(that goes back and forth, it is ""assembled"" from different people talking about it. Among them is a producer from back then and two people who restored the movie, and they talk about every aspect of it), a featurette that I will review on its own individual page here on the site and two trailers, totalling at 3 and a half minutes, that spoil some of this.

That slight distance that can seem apparent sometimes between Hitchcock and his actors works in his favour here as we struggle to see our way through this nightmare. For me Barbara Del Geddes' 'Midge' is less satisfactory than the rest because her character seems to not have the same depth or historic connection. She seems like a child or somebody escaped from some other movie. I know her part was written in to help Stewart's character reveal the 'story so far' as you might say but her perky 'normality' and inability to convince as an 'artist' detract somewhat from the scenes at her apartment. Incidentally it always seems odd to me that Stewart seems so comfortable in this dizzyingly high dwelling with the city spread out beneath. All that said the movie is still absolutely breathtaking. The Herrmann music helps enormously but there is no doubt that Hitch has every frame of this film etched in his mind and never puts a foot wrong. We see Stewart reluctantly begin to follow Novak (in devastating form), then become more interested and then obsessed and the later scenes where his needs become more desperate are some of the most chilling in cinema.",
116,20 September 2012,valadas,5, Too fanciful to be credible,"I never was a Hitchcock fan and this review must be read in this light. I always thought that his films always created an intricacy of situations smelling of false that are suddenly disentangled in the end through an easy and doubtful solution. This movie is one more instance of this with a story full of gaps and snares, unreal and illogical in what concerns not only facts but also the psychological behaviour of the characters. In the end he concocts a rather dramatic final through the disclosure of the true story that was hidden behind the one that was being told us till then, in a rather superficial way This movie has not even at least the suspense or the thrill of some of his other movies like ""Psycho"" or ""North by Northwest"" for instance. It has several flaws and illogical or unexplained situations like for instance: a)- The plan to kill one's wife is too complicated involving a ghost story and the hiring of a double and a detective through a series of too artificial scenes; there is most surely a much easier and credible way to kill one's wife without being suspected of it. b)- It's unbelievable that when the detective meets for the first time after his friend's wife death the woman who lives in the hotel room that was supposedly used by the former, he couldn't recognize at once the woman he was in love with despite the different hair-do and make-up. c)- When the detective goes to that hotel for the first time trying to meet whom he then thought it was his friend's wife after having seen her through the window and it turns out that she isn't there after all, is the hotel lady manager also an accomplice in the plot when she says the other woman has not been there?

I also didn't care about the retired cop or the crazy husband; they were both annoying. The plot is simply pointless, and so is the outcome. I don't blame Alfred Hitchcock for this movie being so bad, considering that plot itself is much worse than directing. Directing without a good plot can't deliver an entertaining and convincing movie, which is exactly the case.

As he stays with her more and more, he begins to suspect something strange about her. It all comes to a head at the San Juan Bautista Mission, when she jumps off of the bell tower. Scottie feels guilty, but some questions remain unanswered. Just who is that woman whom Scottie sees in the museum? Why does she look exactly like Madeleine? And how does a Spanish woman who lived almost 100 years earlier relate to all this? The spirals are an eye-opening aspect. Not only the opening credits, but also Scottie's acrophobia, and the staircase in the bell tower.

Vertigo (1958) also deals with some similar themes explored in Rear Window (1954).  This is the third film that deals with a person's mental state.  The other two being Spellbound (1946), which dealt with a man's fear of white, and Marnie (1964), which dealt with the main character's fear of red.

128,14 July 2008,writers_reign,6, Falling In Love Again,"It's a proved fact that if something is repeated enough times the susceptible person will eventually accept it as fact. Not everyone is susceptible to manipulation and so it is that I find myself at odds with two things that I have heard - and seen on the printed page - repeated for most of my life, 1) Alfred Hitchcock is a 'master' and 2)Vertigo is a classic. So far as the first statement goes I've watched enough of Hitchcock's films to judge him a reasonably competent filmmaker but certainly no more gifted than, say, Howard Hawks, George Cukor, Henry Hathaway etc. On the other hand I have no problem accepting that Billy Wilder and Orson Welles are both 'masters'. I've now seen Vertigo twice over a period of five or six years and I still can't see what all the fuss is about. For one thing it's riddled with flaws. Hitchcock needs to establish that James Steward has a problem with heights so he has Stewart, a plain-clothes detective working out of Frisco, and a uniformed cop, chase a suspect across some rooftops. The suspect leaps between two buildings, the uniformed cop follows, Stewart is last and fails to gain a foothold on the adjacent roof; he slips down the mansard roof and is left clinging to a gutter that is giving under his weight; the uniform cop abandons the chase, allowing the suspect to get away, and attempts to haul Stewart up to safety but falls to his own death. Stewart is now hanging from a rapidly weakening gutter with no hand or footholds available and not a soul to help. Clearly in 30 seconds, 60 tops, he is bound to fall to his own death. Clearly we can't have this so Hitch just cuts the scene and Fades In several months later when we discover Stewart in the apartment of a friend, Barbara Bel Geddes, complete with cane and corset and now, he tells Geddes (us the viewer) retired from the police force. He's then contacted by an acquaintance he hasn't seen since college who has since married into money and is running a large family business on behalf of his wife. He interviews Stewart in his large, well-appointed office and voices his concerns about his wife's strange behaviour, asking Stewart, as a favor, to follow her. I don't know about you but I have been in the offices of several successful businessmen and in 99 per cent of cases their offices boast a picture of their wives and/or children if they are married. Not this kiddie. He tells Stewart he will be dining with his wife later that evening and suggests Stewart be in the restaurant to get a look at his wife. Detective Stewart never thinks to ascertain that it IS his wife or to see a picture or any kind of proof that the woman in the restaurant, Kim Novak, really is the guy's wife. For a society woman Novak cannot come up with one single friend and spends her days totally alone and seemingly obsessed with a long-dead relative. Stewart follows her to a hotel, sees her at the window of her room there, braces the owner, who takes him up to what is now an empty room. Again no explanation of how or where she disappeared to. Eventually Stewart falls for her, she insists on visiting a mission outside Frisco, climbs the bell tower and seemingly Brodies. Verdict: Accidental death. Some months later Stewart sees her 'double' in the street and falls in love all over again. At this point Hitchcock makes us privvy to the scam. When she led him to the bell-tower the guy who hired Stewart was waiting at the top where he threw his REAL wife off the edge. He had merely hired Novak to pose as his wife (she did something similar in Wilder's Kiss Me, Stupid, when she posed as the wife of Ray Walston). Here we encounter the second 'problem'. A woman goes off a bell tower and soon the place is crawling with cops so how come no one noticed a man and a woman, one the husband of the dead woman the other his supposed wife, sneaking away. If you can buy these pathetic plot points then chances are you will think this is something more than a competent meller.

As the detective dangles precariously from the unstable guttering of a tall building, he impulsively looks downwards to glimpse the distant ground seemingly rushing towards him, all the while paradoxically shifting further and further downwards to maximise his inevitable plummet. This optical effect, sometimes known as a ""contra-zoom,"" ""trombone zoom"" or even the ""Vertigo effect,"" was invented by Irmin Roberts, a Paramount second-unit cameraman, and Alfred's Hitchcock's use of the technique is pivotal to the success of 'Vertigo (1958),' the director's final collaboration with James Stewart. Human eyes interpret the relative dimensions of objects using a combination of size and perspective signals, and the simultaneous forward zoom / reverse track, which alters perspective while maintaining object size, instantly perplexes our eyesight, triggering sensory confusion and successfully mimicking the dizzying sensation of acrophobia. It may not be an incredibly subtle means of communicating Scottie's vertigo, but it's effective, and, particularly in the film's second half, Hitchcock employs a seamless combination of subtle and blatant film-making techniques to polish his landmark thriller.",

These were great movies and his Scottie in ""Vertigo"" is one of the better examples of this.  Alfred Hitchcock weaves a tale that after watching makes the viewer feel uncomfortable with their feelings.

133,4 March 2011,EdwardCarter,1, Awful garbage,"The use of colour is probably the only good thing about this slow and boring, overlong, dated film. The first half is much too long and slow and the repetitive driving scenes quickly become very tiresome. Kim Novak was always a poor actress, and looks ridiculous with her bleached platinum blond hair and thick dark eyebrows. Far too many scenes take place in the studio on very fake looking sets with painted backdrops. The opening scene is ruined because it is so fake, not that cops would be chasing a criminal over rooftops anyway. By far the worst thing however is the dreadful miscasting of Grandfather Stewart as Scottie. Stewart was clearly far too old to be playing romantic leads at this point in his career and he was actually more than twice Kim Novak's age (she was 24 and he was 49, though he looked at least 55). His grey wig is laughably bad and he just looks like an ugly old man chasing after his granddaughter. With a younger, better looking actor like Marlon Brando the film might have at least been watchable.",

The girl who Ferguson gets obsessed with is played by a young Kim Novak. What Hitchcock tries to do with all of his movies is try to put all of the suspenseful moments where they absolutely need to be including with this movie as well. Also Stewart was absolutely perfect for this part in this great movie. But it was the love story that made the movie even more suspenseful, just like his 1955 film To Catch a Thief.

146,31 March 2008,HelloTexas11,10, a film for the ages,"It's not hard to see why Alfred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' is considered one of the greatest films ever made. It is a beautifully textured and layered movie, mysterious and confusing, but in a good sense. It's a pity really that it has to come to an end and have it's many components 'explained;' the enjoyment one gets is from imagining all the possibilities conjured up in one's head while watching it. 'Vertigo' might be called an art film masquerading as mainstream entertainment, an apt if ironic description given its subject matter. The plot, to put it as simply as possible- a detective falls in love with a woman twice, the second time not realizing it is the same woman. She deceives him into thinking she is someone else, both times. A two-page synopsis of the various ins and outs of the story would do it no more justice. James Stewart plays the detective, Scottie Ferguson. I've always wondered why Hitchcock chose Stewart to play this role. Being the great actor he was, he does a fine job and is very convincing, but if I were to have read this script at the time and been asked to think of, say, fifty working actors to consider for the part, James Stewart would have come in fifty-first. There just is nothing in the actor's previous body of work to suggest he is right for the character in any way. The gangly, drawling, slow-talking, clearheaded, common-sensed Everyman made perfect sense for a movie like 'It's A Wonderful Life.' But to play an obsessed, neurotic, acrophobic, compulsive control freak who practically forces himself on a woman and insists she dress up like the presumed-dead, former object of his affections... Jimmy Stewart? You've got to be joking. And yet somehow it works. Kim Novak as the woman is easier to figure out. She was the latest in a series of icy blondes just waiting to be unfrozen in Hitchcock films; this was a continuing theme in his movies that would continue long past 'Vertigo.' Novak captures the strange Madeleine and more common Judy very well; it is quite believable that the second character is, at first, intended to be a completely different woman. Much of the magic of 'Vertigo' comes from not only wondering what will happen next, but pondering what has just happened, and what it means. Rational explanations become less and less interesting. This is what I meant about the ending- outside of a supernatural one, there's almost no way a movie like 'Vertigo' can have a completely satisfactory outcome. One certainly has to give Hitchcock credit for coming as close as possible. He was not one for the paranormal anyway (I suppose 'The Birds' comes closest); his flights of fantasy have more to do with human motivations and the bizarre, sometimes insane workings of the mind. 'Vertigo' takes this approach, and in the characters of Scottie and Madeleine/Judy, shows the most extreme manifestations of desire, submission, and delusion.",
147,14 October 2021,guskeller,10, An all time great,"Vertigo is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films and one of the greatest movies of all time. Its most noticeable strength is the use of vibrant color, which Vertigo wields to convey themes of lust, death, and guilt. The cinematography continues with complex arc shots and dolly zooms that are utilized throughout. Meanwhile, more subtle framing compositions are consistently setting up mysterious tones and motifs surrounding obsession. However, Vertigo is far more than just its visuals.",
148,15 October 2006,mlraymond,10," A detective hired to watch over a suicidal woman falls in love with her and gets involved in an eerie, baffling mystery.","Many viewers consider this film to be Hitchcock's masterpiece. I agree, due to a number of factors. The hypnotic, lush score by Bernard Herrman combines with the superb set design and cinematography to create an unforgettable atmosphere of strangeness and uncanny beauty. The performances are all excellent, with Kim Novak's dual role convincingly creating two completely different characters. The most outstanding,and at the same time most problematic aspect of the story is the character of Scottie. James Stewart is so convincing as the obsessed hero that he actually becomes uncomfortable to watch. His likable, easy-going character at the beginning has become a driven, compulsive,perhaps even seriously disturbed man by the end. He has suffered a mental breakdown and is terribly vulnerable, but our initial sympathy,though still felt for this flawed hero, has become strained and awkward. Stewart's performance is a triumph of screen acting, yet so powerful as to risk overwhelming the audience with conflicting feelings. Any actor who can create such a genuinely disturbing and yet basically appealing character deserves high praise indeed.",

150,13 May 2012,Artimidor,10," A killer combination - Stewart, Novak, Herrmann, Hitchcock and the perfect script","""Vertigo"" is one of those killer combinations where just about everything fits like a glove. For one there's the ingenious screenplay by Alec Coppel and Samuel Taylor based on the French novel ""D'Entre les Morts""(usually translated as ""From the Realm of the Dead""). It's a spellbinding narration of a retired San Francisco police detective who gets caught up in mysterious events with supernatural undertones, peppered by deception, betrayal, crime and obsession. Then there's the cast: John ""Scottie"" Ferguson is played in understated fashion by James Stewart, the epitome of the humble, humane gentleman and good friend who cannot deny a favor. Confronting him with mystifying blond sexbomb Kim Novak really gets things rolling and is electrifying to see. Every moment of the main characters' difficult relationship throughout the film is absolutely believable and their chemistry on screen evident and riveting. In the music department Bernard Herrmann once again outdoes himself with an engrossing score, which will make you hold your breath in anticipation of what lies ahead - or hit you right in the face whenever necessary, and that's a good thing. The cinematography? Pitch perfect. Locations like the Golden Gate Bridge shine in all their Technicolor glory as do striking camera shots like the one from the roof at the very beginning or those from the Old Mission San Juan Bautista bell tower.",

To date I have watched three Hitchcock movies: ""Rebecca"", ""The Birds"" and ""Psycho"". None of the three fulfilled my expectations: I see the modernity and sometimes brilliant solutions by the author, but they always felt overpraised to me. Maybe after ""Vertigo"" I'll have to watch them again and understand the depth I sensed in this one. Is it a mystery movie? Yes, but only on the surface. Like any masterpiece, this film has a number of levels of interpretation: the plain mystery, solved at 3/4 of the movie; Scottie's spiral into madness, man's need for control over life and death, the meaning of colour to address emotions. These are just a few examples of just how multifaceted ""Vertigo"" can be, evolving from the original script into a real work of art. This might very well be the best example to show how Hitchcock managed to craft popular movies with a (heavy!) authorial touch for those who can grasp it.",
155,1 March 2009,seymourblack-1,10," A Stylish, Subversive Masterpiece","""Vertigo"" is a beautifully realised psychological thriller which very elegantly tells the story of an extremely calculated murder plot which is expertly executed by a perpetrator whose involvement remains unrecognised (by the authorities) throughout. With its disturbing themes of obsession, deception, necrophilia, guilt and fear and its numerous noir motifs (mirrors, doubles, portraits etc), it provides a very stylish, absorbing and unsettling portrayal of a series of events in which, so many things are not what they appear to be and much is left unexplained. The skillful manner in which the more elliptical, dreamlike and thought provoking episodes are depicted are particularly enjoyable and its easy to see how these would be such a source of inspiration to the many directors who have been so strongly influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's work in later years.",
156,13 August 2008,cliffjohns36,2, Not nearly up to the usual Hitchcock standards on detail and logic.,"I side with those who have criticized this film as being exceptionally poor by Hitchcock standards. While Psycho, North By Northwest, Suspicion, Dial M For Murder, et al, employed the virtues of logic and rationality coupled with Hitch's normal dose of high suspense, this film fails in nearly every way to convey the seeds of reality. Thus I couldn't appreciate whatever suspense it tried to conjure. The whole storyline seemed flooded with improbabilities, illogical sequences, flawed reasoning, and implausible character acts & emotions. It's hard to imagine that Hitchcock was responsible for this film, or that James Stewart, Kim Novak, and Barbara Bel Geddes agreed to act in it. Just for starters, why in the world would a spouse cook up a scheme this ultra-elaborate & complicated to do away with his wife? Wouldn't arsenic or an auto accident be simpler to arrange? And why would he decide to frame one of his closest friends, anyway? How could the dead wife be toted up that long spiral stairs at the bell tower by a man in his sixties? And would he really allow for the risk of being detected while making that long climb up? How could Madeline (Judy)adore a man she was also setting up as a patsy? Why would she stay around after the murder and risk being identified as an accomplice, as indeed she finally was? Why would she allow easygoing Scottie to coerce her into wearing all those new clothes and unraveling her disguise after seeing that he was suspicious? For that matter, why would she permit herself to be prodded into climbing the belltower stairs once she realized he was on to her? Her resistance seemed token. Maybe there are explanations for these and 100 other things I didn't understand, but together they ruined the film for me.",

As with most Hitchcock films sex is a frequently occurring and underlying theme, Hitchcock uses sexuality to propel the key narrative. Personally, I see Vertigo as an example of male-lust, obsession and perversion. Some might go as far as saying Vertigo is about Hitchcock's own attraction to women, which in Vertigo is dangerously perverse. Vertigo is a film which is open to interpretation and one which requires the utmost concentration.

For some inexplicable reason, he falls in love with her. Once we reach what we're first to believe is the climax, we learn he's been duped somewhat. As have we.

Stewart was also adept at playing two types of people, a kind, good natured man, but also a hostile, temperamental man in places. You wanted to hate Tom Elmore. It was structured so very well also; it was almost like two dramas in one. Bernard Herrmann, an excellent musician, definitely and effectively provided the needed eeriness for the film.

Vertigo is to thrillers what Casablanca is to Romances, what Raging Bull is to sports movies, and what Singing in the Rain is to musicals. Vertigo breaks rules and crosses lines that are not meant to be crossed. The fact that the main character even has Vertigo is a stroke of genius. But the real genius happens at the end, when James Stewart's romantic ordeal is over and he loses his Vertigo. It makes the movie seem like a circle, where in the end Stewart is the same as he was in the beginning. This really caught my attention and made me fall in love with this movie. Vertigo is also one of those movies that cannot be copied. Psycho was copied hundreds of times, as was Rear Window and the Birds, all Hitchcock masterpieces. I know that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but each great director should have one movie that is unimitatable and incredibly unique. Hitchcock pulled this requirement off with Vertigo.",

I'm a huge fan of Mr. Hitchcocks work, but this one marks Hitchcocks hall of great movies (which there are many) as being the worst.

197,21 July 2010,brefane,7, Dizzy plot,"Considered by many to be Hitchcock's masterpiece, Vertigo is overrated and not really one of Hitchcock's best films. Great, even good films, get better with repeated viewings, but not Vertigo. Despite Bernard Hermann's seductive score, excellent cinematography by Robert Burks, an interesting set up, and a story replete with Hitchcok's ironies and themes subsequent viewings make Gavin Elster's convoluted plot to murder his wife with Stewart's Scottie as an unwitting witness seems utterly preposterous, and impossible to pull off and stage. Surely, there are easier ways to get away with murder! And so much time is spent setting Scottie up for the fall that in retrospect much of it seems gratuitous. The overcomplicated murder plot recalls Hitchcok's stiff and stagy, Dial M for Murder(54). The plotting rather than the execution makes Vertigo inferior Hitchcock even though in many respects it's his most personal and audacious film. Much of the dialog between Stewart and Novak's Madelaine is awkward and tedious, and unnecessarily drawn out; one of the film's best sequences employs virtually no dialog. Both Saul Bass' animated dream sequence and Barbara Bel Geddes' Madge feel unnecessary as well. Nonetheless, Vertigo is an interesting film with the parts being better than the whole, and the less you know about it the better. Novak's wispy persona was never better suited to a film role, and Stewart's pale blue eyes are downright vertiginous. Recommended.",

202,4 September 2008,jboothmillard,10, Vertigo,"This is meant to be one of the great films directed by Sir Alfred Hitchcock, after Psycho of course. James Stewart plays Detective John 'Scottie' Ferguson, he used to be a cop until he discovered his fear of heights, acrophobia which gives him Vertigo. He has tried to get rid of this fear but he can't. He is asked by Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) to keep an eye on his mysterious wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak). As he gets to know her, he sees resemblance to a woman from the past in a painting she stares at. He also falls in love with her, but their romance is cut short when Mr. Elster makes John believe that Madeleine committed suicide. After a little while, he sees a woman that bares a very close resemblance to Madeleine, Judy Barton (Novak, of course). He becomes very obsessive turning Judy into Madeleine, he moves quite far from his Mr. Nice Guy image. A very imaginative story that will chill and touch. Hitchcock's cameo is a man that walks past in a grey suit carrying a small trumpet. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Sound. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, James Stewart was number 12 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 13 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 12 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 61 on 100 Years, 100 Movies and it was number 29 on The 100 Greatest Films.

209,1 February 2000,Andrew-162,10, Haunting,"There is so much to this movie that an amateur watcher like myself can not come close to doing it justice, but I'll try. This movie is one of the 10 best of all time, and without a doubt Hitchcock's best. Here are the top things about it. 1. The Themes: The theme of Madeliene (The gorgeous Kim Novak in an absolutely haunting performance)getting her mind inhabited from a lost woman of a past, the theme of Scottie (Jimmie Stewart in an equally impressive performance) falling hopelessly in love with this shadow of a woman he knows so little about and becomes obsessed with rescuing her, and finally, the theme of Judy, who to Scottie is a portrait of Madeleine, a voice calling to him from beyond the grave, but possibly most importantly, the theme of Scottie's vertigo, which prevents him from ""Saving"" his love that final run up the church tower 2. The Beauty: The movie was nominated for a Best Art Direction Oscar. I have no idea what it lost to, but I'm sure Vertigo was more worthy of it. Hitchcock's ""San Francisco"" is as haunting as the rest of the movie, from it's ironically beautiful graveyards to the shape of the church from which Madeleine takes the deadly plunge. It is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen 3. THE SCORE: This is the most important of all of them. The one reason that movies like Psycho and North By Northwest are better in my opinion than movies like Rear Window and Rebecca is the fact that Psycho and North By Northwest had shrieking Bernard Hermann scores, the most memorable of all movie scores (Taxi Driver was also a highlight for him). But VERTIGO is the best of all of them. Vertigo's score almost makes us feel like we are Scottie, so confused, so sad, and yet so scared. It is the most memorable of all movie scores, even more the so then the more famous Psycho score.",
210,6 August 2022,bregund,4, The worst Hitchcock film,"Hitchcock was a visionary, groundbreaking director who was an expert storyteller and I'm a huge fan of most of his films: North by Northwest, Rear Window, Saboteur, Psycho, The Birds, all of them timeless, ten-star films that will still be watchable a hundred years from now. Vertigo doesn't belong in that group. Yes it's a technically impressive film with all of his trademark camera angles, closeups, fades, settings, costumes, etc etc etc but the film has a gigantic flaw: the casting of James Stewart in the lead role. As if the film's premise of a man being sexually attracted to his friend's wife and then later on remaking the same woman into little more than a sex doll isn't disturbing enough, they cast a middle aged actor in the lead role. In Rear Window, Stewart is perfectly cast. In this film, he's exponentially creepy. I understand how difficult it must have been to cast this part, since the lead character is the 1950s equivalent of men who shoot upskirt videos, but come on...James Stewart? Why? I can't be the only one in the world who thinks that he's completely and totally wrong for this film.",
211,20 April 1999,bnm81510,10, Prime Hitchcock,"As mesmerizing as it is long and difficult to comprehend, ""Vertigo"" is one of cinema's strangest tales of romantic obsession, the kind that certainly would not be made nowadays, since the subject is increasingly demonized in the American culture. Surprisingly enough, it works, in large part through the director's mastery over the medium. Some speculate that it was a highly personal project for him, a casting out of his own internal struggles. Such theories validity is questionable, but anyone watching will notice the movie's much lesser degree of calculating, joyful logic that almost all other Hitchcock's works are saturated with. Incredibly true to its title, by virtue of an eerie score and some dizzying cinematography, the movie induces the sense of romantic vertigo in the audience. A fantastic opening credits sequence which resembles digital animation, suggests a visionary quality that refused to be confined to its time period.",
212,30 January 2009,Dr_Coulardeau,10, Mistrust all towers,"This film is one of the best and not only of Hitchcock's films, but of all universal global cinema. What's good about it? Everything. And yet what exactly, if I may ask? First of all it is a beautiful love story. A man who has been disabled by life, or rather by his profession  he was a cop and saw his partner die by falling from a roof when trying to save him  and his developing a severe case of acrophobia, is hired by a friend of his to watch his wife and find out what she is doing in her afternoons when she gets out and does not seem to remember later in the evening what she has done. The man falls in love with the woman who is of course not the wife but a bait that is supposed to make that man witness her suicide, or rather the husband's wife's murder by the husband himself. But that he cannot know. And that love will survive that event, and even his second phase of disability, this time entirely mental since he feels guilty for having been unable to stop the woman when climbing in the tower of the Mission's church because of his acrophobia. And this love survives so well that he falls again when he sees the woman again in the hotel room where he had seen her when she was baiting him into the drama, though now he does not know it is her, he just thinks she looks like her. And she falls again herself in spite of all her attempts at resisting. And the next phase in the drama is going to lock up these two in total bleakness. But there I stop. You have to find out these superb details all by yourself. The second reason that the film is a masterpiece of global cinema is because it is a thriller that is so well sown up and patched up and glued up that even if you know every detail you will enjoy it just the same: it is a thriller that deserves to be watched a hundred times. The haute cinematographic couture of Hitchcock makes every single viewing more enjoyable than the previous one. Even, I think, you may see in the one hundredth viewing elements you had not seen before because the film, each frame of the film, each image of the film, is loaded with myriads of details that are all more significant than the others. And yet it does not look neither baroque nor rococo. It is just perfect and yet so rich that the perfection takes one hundred viewings to be seen. The third reason why this film is a jewel is that Hitchcock plays on height and stairs and staircases and climbing, and descending or ascending, as he so often, or should I say always, does. Here the stairs are coming naturally since we are in San Francisco and the streets are going up and down, and the houses are perched on slanting slopes, and the embankments have stairs to walk into the Bay, and naturally all buildings, churches, hotels, and whatever have stairs in the front and stairs in the back and stairs inside to go up to the upper floors. And the best is of course the staircase going to the top of the church tower in the Mission, and we will go up that winding staircase twice. And we will fly down that staircase twice in exactly the same way. And the whole film will be dominated by the long apparition of the Golden Gate Bridge, that bridge under which all fish bite into the bait that is thrown at them and are fished out of the foaming water into the burning furnace of the hell of a frying pan. The staircase metaphor is powerful in that film, and so natural, that we just wonder if at that moment Hitchcock has not been able to control his own derangement and we can maybe envisage the fact that he is not completely schizophrenic or psychotic, just psychedelic. The last thing I would like to say on that film is that Hitchcock is also a master of rhythm. He must have been a conductor in some other life of his and his temperament is definitely not perfect. He likes rhythmic variations and he can have scenes that seem so slow that they must last hours and some others that go in a wink of an eyelid. But it is neither haphazard nor unjustified nor in any way disturbing or boring. Every single pace, no matter what, is entirely ingrained in the plot and is part of the beauty of the film and our pleasure. We don't even have the freedom to breathe some when the rhythm is going down because then the dramatic tension goes up and vice versa. The denser the slower and the faster the least intense, but then the two together always give the maximum meaningful signification you can imagine.",

True, it has many elements of a masterpiece.  It is a major mood piece.  The sad, elegaic melancholy is sustained throughout, thanks largely to Bernard Hermann's score.  The acting is first rate, even by Novak.  The color is masterful.  All this having been said, why then do I say that this just misses being a masterpiece.  Because, to me, the film has a serious flaw which mars the film, although it doesn't destroy it.  The flaw occurs in the scene that occurs about halfway through the film, after Madeline has been dead for a year, when Scotty meets Judy Barton, also played by Novak.  After Scotty brings her back to her hotel room and says goodnight, Judy begins an internal monologue, accompanied by a visual flashback, that gives away the whole plot.  After this, there is no more suspense!  The viewer knows something that Scotty doesn't.  Wouldn't it have been far better for the viewer to have been kept in suspense as well and find out the truth at the same time Scotty does.  If you don't believe me, watch the film again and fast forward past this scene, and see if it isn't an improvement.  Otherwise, a masterpiece.  9/10",

And then we get a prologue where we watch our main character Scottie running along rooftops until he's clinging for his life and another policeman falls to his death trying to help him. Thinking back over Hitchcock's other movies of this vein (Notorious, Spellbound, and Rope in particular), credit sequences were lighter, opening scenes were less heavy and brighter (even in Rope, the murder happens quickly and then it begins to lighten up visually), and there were far fewer ominous tones bounding about.

This is Hitchcock's most personal, passionate film, reportedly one of his favorites ""with some reservations"", unfortunately it did not perform very well during its 1958 release neither box office or reception wise. Hitchcock put the blame for the movie's box office failure on its star, James Stewart, whom he felt was becoming too old to keep audiences interested anymore. What Hitchcock did not realize was that this was not true. The only problem there is with Vertigo is that it was made too early in time.

That's Hitchcockian, for sure! Looking back, I can recall in my teens and twenties taking this all in with a grain of salt and a laugh. Many years later, it became more depressing and in a way something you can relate to, again in a strange Hitchcockian sort of way! Go figure. But that is the magic of hitch and will always remain so. This is one helluva movie, and not to be forgotten. For today's audiences and tastes, it may be refreshing as it deals with the supernatural, and hints of such popular programs as THE DEAD FILES and GHOST ADVENTURES etc. There is so much to this, multiple viewings are recommended, to say the least. In short, you have to feel for Scottie who is literally cast in the atypical Hitch dilemma as being caught between a rock and a hard place, only this time, it's a case of an all too confused gent in love with a ghost! Or is he? Or is he the biggest fool of all time entangled in a dynamic scam of scams? You be the judge. One thing for certain, Kim Novak has never been more beautiful and you can take that to the bank. She most definitely plays the ultimate Hitch femme fatale, perhaps one of his best leading ladies in all his films. This is ultimate late night viewing that will keep you up late and thinking about days afterward. A one of a kind movie with a stand out script and likewise supporting cast, including the great Lee Patrick, who always delivers, whether it be dramatic or comedic.

Needless to say, nothing is as it seems. Hitchcock's direction is excellent as usual, the music moody, the cinematography is outstanding (especially the famous 'vertigo' scenes on the bell-tower stairs) and the plot is clever, albeit far-fetched (significant suspension of belief is require to buy into Ferguson's growing obsessions and his target's response). Jimmy Stewart is fine playing his standard stammering, low-key every-man but, at twice Novak's age, the 'magic' between them is a bit hard to swallow.

He was able to utilize such a visible persona, as well as to attract some of the very finest acting stars of the day.

239,9 January 2022,nickenchuggets,8, Hitchcock's best?,"I can think of a lot of movies that managed to impress me even if I had high expectations for them already before watching. Unfortunately, I wouldn't really count Vertigo as part of this category. Often considered Hitchcock's best movie, Vertigo is really one of those films you have to watch more than once because not only is it very long, its plot is also pretty confusing. Even upon reaching the end, I still didn't really understand what the plot was trying to convey, and this left me frustrated because I typically always like Hitchcock movies. I still think this one is good, but not really comparable to things like North by Northwest, Psycho, or even The Man Who Knew Too Much (either one). In order to comprehend why I think this movie is quite overrated, I have to explain the confusing and unorthodox plot. It has some similarities to other Hitchcock films because it involves murder, but is much more complicated than it initially seems. Vertigo follows John Ferguson (Jimmy Stewart), a former cop who retires one day after a particularly traumatic incident that involved one of his coworkers falling to his death. Gavin (Tom Helmore), an old friend of John's from his college days, tells John he wants him to keep an eye on his wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), because she's thought to be mentally ill. John agrees, and soon follows Madeleine to an art museum, where she sits on a bench opposite a portrait of a young girl named Carlotta and watches it closely. Carlotta was a girl who lived in the mid 1800s but died at only the age of 26. John finds out that Carlotta killed herself because her husband didn't like her anymore, and that she is actually an ancestor of Madeleine's. Later, Madeleine travels to a fort underneath the Golden Gate Bridge and throws herself into the water. John fishes her out, and they start to form a relationship together. Before long, she is driven to a church, which Madeleine claims is her childhood house. While there, she inexplicably runs up the bell tower. John tries to pursue her, but the traumatic experience he had when he was a cop has given him a deathly fear of heights. After failing to keep up with Madeleine, he sees her body get flung off the bell tower and slam down on the church roof below. She is dead. John becomes so depressed he essentially turns into a vegetable. After getting better, he comes across a woman named Judy who looks suspiciously similar to how Madeleine used to look. Shortly afterwards, John starts to try convincing Judy to wear the same things Madeleine used to so that she can look like her. This agitates Judy because it's almost as if John only likes her for resembling a different person. Judy goes along with the plan anyway, but one day, John notices she is somehow wearing the same red jewel necklace Carlotta has in the art museum portrait. John knows something is up, and drives Judy against her will to the church where Madeleine ""killed herself."" He makes Judy retrace Madeleine's steps before she died, which includes making her go up the bell tower steps. John finally realizes that Judy and Madeleine look so similar because they're the same person, and Judy admits she used to love Gavin until he got bored of her (just like how Carlotta's husband got bored of her a century earlier). Judy says she was paid by Gavin to impersonate Madeleine and make John believe she was possessed by Carlotta. John is able to reach the top of the bell tower this time, and despite Judy's deceitful acts, he kisses her. A curious nun arrives to see what the commotion is about, and Judy, surprised, jumps back and falls off the bell tower. John is alone in the world once again. While I did like the depressing and ironic ending of this movie, I don't feel like it holds up as well as some other Hitchcock films. Like I said already, Vertigo is hugely overrated. Upon its release, it was called overly long, confusing, and too full of sappy romance scenes, which are all still legitimate complaints. Hitchcock movies usually have confusing storylines with a lot of twists and turns, but this one changes paths more than most other films he directed. Additionally, many aspects of the movie haven't really aged well at all, a prime example being the fact that the use of dolly zoom was one of its selling points. Back in the 50s, this was probably more impressive, but if you look at it from the advanced technological standpoint we're at now, it seems underwhelming. I guess you can consider Vertigo a film noir, but it's too colorful and not dreary enough to fit this description, really. One thing I can say is the acting and settings are really good. One of the best shots in the whole movie is when ""Madeleine"" is underneath the Golden Gate Bridge, and is probably the most iconic frame from the movie. There's also a lot of colorful sequences and neon signs, which are nice to look at, but also hurts the movie's chances of being considered noir. Jimmy Stewart delivers one of his best performances ever in this movie, as he is slowly driven insane by the thought of having seen this girl (Judy) somewhere before. Kim Novak plays both her and Madeleine, which ensures that the audience too will notice these two characters look the same. While some people will try and tell me the movie's confusing plot is actually a bonus because it gives you a reason to watch Vertigo a second time, the film is basically too long to warrant such a thing. The ending, while sadly fitting, was a cop out in my eyes because Judy had no reason to fall off the bell tower other than being slightly startled by a nun. A lot of Hitchcock endings seem rushed and this one is no different. To be clear, although this movie is severely flawed, it still has that classic Hitchcock atmosphere, surprising moments, and a twist ending. I don't think it deserves to be considered the best movie of all time though, especially considering that Hitchcock himself has made better ones than this.",

Certainly ""Vertigo"" falls into that category, for it is one of Hitchock's finest films, possibly the best he ever made. Although the plot is rather improbable, and the director could perhaps have cut down on the automobile searches, this does not matter, as the film is excellent in all other respects. The film benefits greatly from the faultless performances of the players; in particular, Kim Novak. On seeing the film for the first time, one feels rather cheated by the solution being revealed at such an early stage. However, in retrospect, one realizes that the decision is the correct one, for it actually makes the story more credible. For example: when Scotty (James Stewart) meets Judy in the hotel, after her initial display of fear,she agrees after four minutes (I have timed this!) to go on a date with him and later agreeing to give up her job. Incredible? not when you understand her true identity and the fact that she has fallen in love with him - remember when, as Madelaine she said: ""It wasn't meant to happen this way"" before going into the bell-tower.",

249,25 June 2020,dr_clarke_2,10, Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film?,"Is Vertigo Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film? It's often described as such, and indeed in 2012 was voted best film ever made by the BFI's Sight & Sound critics poll, knocking Citizen Kane off the top spot for the first time ever. Any film so heavily hyped has difficult expectations to live up to, but certainly Vertigo is a remarkable slice of cinema.
The story sees retired policeman ""Scottie"" Ferguson hired by his old friend Gavin Elster to follow and investigate Elster's wife Madeleine, who Gavin claims is behaving oddly. Adapted from the novel D'entre les morts by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, the screenplay written by Alec Coppel and Samuel Taylor is riddled with misdirection and has an often sinister air, with suggestions that Madeleine is possessed by the spirit of a dead woman who committed suicide. Scenes such as Konstantin Shayne's Pop Leibel telling the story of Carlotta Valdes' suicide significantly add to this feeling. The story changes direction halfway through when Madeleine commits suicide by jumping from a church tower, after which Scottie - who had fallen in love with her - encounters Judy Barlow, a woman who looks exactly like Madeleine.
The explanation for why Madeleine and Judy are doppelgangers and what is really going on is enormously satisfying, as the shocking, tragic denouement. But as intriguing as the story of Vertigo is, it is only part of a greater whole. It succeeds on many different levels, not least of which is James Stewart's performance as Scottie: cast against type, Stewart plays the increasingly obsessive, disturbed character with twitchy intensity and his treatment of Judy in the second half of the film is profoundly creepy. Hitchcock deliberately chose to reveal the truth about Judy to the audience two thirds of the way through the film, which allows the audience to understand why Judy would put up with a man who tries to control every aspect of her appearance and behaviour. Kim Novak is as impressive as Stewart, especially since as Madeleine Novak is playing a woman who is acting and gives a remarkably convincing performance as a woman supposedly questioning her sanity.
The look of the film is also a key factor in its enduring legacy. Hitchcock expertly controls every aspect of the film, as demonstrated by the spiral symbolism: the recurring spirals of the opening titles set the tone for a plot that spirals back on itself, with Scottie pressuring Judy into dressing as Madeleine, and ultimately forcing her to revisit the scene of her apparent suicide, resulting in Judy's actual death. Bernard Hermann's score complements this theme perfectly, creating a swirling vortex of sound. Following Madeleine's ""death"" there's an almost psychedelic sequence in which Scottie is haunted by what has happened, and with a mix of different coloured filters and even animation, it's like nothing seen previously in any of Hitchcock's films. Regular Hitchcock cinematographer Robert Burks adds to the film's unsettling atmosphere with the famous dolly zoom first used in the opening scenes of Scottie dangling from a rooftop, which visually represents the acrophobia and vertigo that haunt him throughout the film. The lengthy scenes of Scottie following Madeleine, which are largely dependent on physical and facial acting from Stewart and Novak, are given a highly distinctive atmosphere by the combination of the score and the camerawork.
Quantifying any film as the best ever made is always problematic, since it is ultimately a matter of opinion. But Vertigo is certainly one of those movies in which every single aspect works well both individually and with every other part to make a captivating cinematic experience. If nothing else, it serves as an object lesson in why Alfred Hitchcock remains one of the film industry's most revered directors.",
250,28 October 2005,wildduck-1,10, dream vs. reality,"Warning contains Spoilers - Hitchcock beautifully explores the need for illusion in Vertigo. Scottie, played by James Stewart, is a man who drifts without direction, who can't make up his mind about anything. He is deeply dissatisfied with the real world. He seemingly has a choice between two women. Midge is open, practical, and unexciting  a representative of life as it is. Madeleine is exotic, mysterious, complex, a perfect fantasy figure. He falls in love with Madeleine and lets her lead him into her world of drama and illusion. She becomes, for the audience as well as for him, the wish fulfillment of the dream woman. Two-thirds of the way through the movie, having strongly tied us to this character, Hitchcock betrayals us  she dies suddenly and inexplicably, we are disappointed and confused. We are, surprisingly as disoriented as Scottie is. Soon after, Hitchcock explains what has happened, and we realize that we have been deceived, with Scottie, by a cheap trick. Neither audience nor hero wants to believe it. We both want her back. We prefer the illusion, false as it is, to the reality. Through Scottie we are made to see and feel the consequences of rejecting real people for a dream. Judy, a graceless, uninteresting girl, has been impersonating Madeleine all along. Still obsessed with Madeleine, Scottie forces Judy to recreate her role for him. At first she resists, wanting to be loved for herself, but then, like so many of us, she agrees to conform to his image of her. Otherwise she will lose him.",

I am not interested in the politics surrounding the film as to who may have been in what part and why the film did not fare well financially, the ones who were involved should have been congratulated for a job well done. For me the film has the stamp of brilliance on it from one of the greatest directors and the end result is like velvet. I very rarely single anyone out for praise no matter how good I think the performances were but if you watch this film pay particular attention to James Stewart and Kim Novak. They are both quite breathtaking for reasons you will become aware of during the film. The directors attention to detail is one of his trademarks and as far as I can see does not short change the paying public.

A very strange story comes out of it. It winds up being like peeling the layers of an onion. Most of the film you have no idea what is going on but it slowly revealed. One of the innovations in this film is the ""vertigo"" effect that Hitchcock uses: He alternates moving the camera in while zooming out or vice-versa.

The story has massive plot holes and is incredibly slow I can usually watch slow paced talkies as I've pointed out above I think Under Capricorn is his best film and that's slow and talkie but Capricorn is always interesting and has the fantastic Ingrid Bergman with Joseph Cotton.  For me after Rear Window Hitchcock lost the plot a bit and often his films started to drag with Vertigo and the Birds being the worst offenders.  The only films he made after Rear Window that are worthy of his great name are North by Northwest, Psycho (well the first hour) and Frenzy.

Kim Novak certianly gave her finest performance here playing a very complex range of emotions with subtlety and a superb craftsman's touch. Stewart, in what I think is his finest role, also delivers a very multi-layered performance. There is yet another brainy bespectacled sidekick for Scottie in the tradition of Shadow of a Doubt and Strangers on a Train. Numerous San Francisco landmarks highlight the exquisite cinematography and Bernard Hermann's score hauntingly resides in the memory. The trick of zooming in and simultaneously pulling the camera back for the the illusion of depth also demonstrated great ingenuity. 10/10.",

Now its like a saw across bone without anesthesia. Also its Hitchcocks most beautiful film, with the greatest sense of color and mise en scene, possibly his most complex script. It's deadly accurate psycho-analysis. Jimmy Stewart is creepy as hell in this too.

279,1 January 2023,hnt_dnl,1, Least favorite film from my favorite director,"Make no mistake, I personally believe to this day that Alfred Hitchcock is the greatest director in film history. In fact, this film VERTIGO (1958) premiered 1 and 2 years, respectively, prior to 2 of my favorite Hitchcock films North by Northwest (1959) and Psycho (1960). North by Northwest is highly engaging and witty adventure movie that essentially was the prototype for both James Bond films as well as summer action flicks. Psycho, in my top 5 films ever, basically created the slasher genre for horror. But I honestly don't what Vertigo was the prototype for other than pretentious, overrated films that critics and fans inexplicably fawn over as some great masterpiece when in reality it's an exercise in boredom. Including Vertigo, other such highly revered films that I feel are woefully overrated are The Shining, The Dark Knight, John Carpenter's The Thing, and Fargo, to name just a few. These films do NOTHING for me and I will never understand their appeal or popularity. These are films where just because everyone says they are great, people just jump on the bandwagon of hyperbolic and blanket praise. And I think Vertigo may be the very film that started this dubious trend in Hollywood. Interestingly, Vertigo was a critical and commercial failure when it first came out and in my opinion, deserved that dubious honor. Sometimes, there's nothing deep or interesting about a movie. It's just not a good movie. But over the years, film critics started analyzing Vertigo and found all these ""mysterious and deep"" layers. And then the bandwagon continued for decades to the point that there's a large contingent that actually has this forgettable, pretentious film as the best of all time.",

This is arguably Hitchcock's greatest film, a dark, fascinating mystery about obsession and control. Stewart is excellent as the befuddled detective. Novak was a limited actress but in this film her stiffness and other-worldly beauty are perfectly suited to the role of the elusive woman that Stewart must have. From the great opening scene where Stewart's vertigo is revealed to the plot twist midway to the haunting finale, this is an expertly constructed film.

Ultimately, for all of Hitchcock's vibrant colors, striking camera angles, and the thrilling dream sequence, we simply do not care whether the characters live or die.

This film is too long for its own good, and has a bit of a rare 'symptom' of peaking too soon. It seems all the pressure fomented in the first hour is already resolved well before the final act of the film, and although there is certainly matter to the second half of the story, a lot of the essential atmosphere and purpose the film was subtly weaving for a while are put to sleep before a different kind of tone or 'color' (*wink wink*) completely takes over - one that is much more obvious, ordinary, maybe somewhat tedious. The first half is so mysterious, intimate, smooth, suspenseful, hauntingly romantic... and all this is traded away for a more conventional affair. Finally, the very title of the film seems a little misleading if not a lot, especially given this is a Hitchcock, where one would really expect something different and isn't necessarily given a worthy compensation for it. Overall, it's a fine film, but weaker in some respects than it seems it is given credit for.",

291,29 August 2016,brianberta,10, An emotionally complex masterpiece.,"This is definitely my favorite Hitchcock film. When I first watched it, I viewed it as a tragic romance film, but only with future viewings did I really how wrong this reading was and that, in reality, Scottie was dangerous and obsessive. For instance, after Madeleine jumped into a river in an apparent suicide attempt, Scottie's way of handling the situation was by bringing her to his house, undressing her, and leaving her in his bed without telling anybody what happened (a doctor, a neighbor, or even Midge or Gavin, at the very least). If this doesn't make him creepy, I honestly don't know what would. The less time he spends with Midge and the more time he spends around Madeleine, the more clear it is that he's emotionally damaged and that the movie is about the dangers of his obsession, which extend to his fixation on Madeleine in place of Midge, his creepy behavior and demands with Judy, or the reveal that Gavin chose Scottie out of the likely hundreds of acquaintances he had since he knew that Scottie was the only person peculiar and strange enough that his elaborate scheme could possibly depend on. In spite of what we learn about the other characters in the final act, I think the full extent to Scottie's emotional damage is revealed during this part of the film (most of this is caused by Gavin and Judy though) and, as a result, we ultimately fear for Judy and are on her side.",

It is more than a psychological thriller, a drama or a ""colorful film noir"". Superb dialogues, a beautiful shot of San Francisco, which seems to be intentionally strange -and not the well-known american city- and, of course, Vertigo give us the best James Stewart and Kim Novak performances. There is no much to say about the score: the opening credits are not as easy to listen as ""Psycho"" or ""North by Northwest"", and the fascinating ""scene d'Amore"" (where Stewart finally changes Novak into another Novak) is just a variation of ""Tristan und Isolde"" prelude (R.

Telling the story of an obsessed ex-cop (Stewart), Hitchcock weaves a tangled web of suspense, inner conflict, and the supernatural. Of all Hitchcock's films, this one is said to be the most personal, as it regards Hitch's fascination with women and the traits of actresses. Bernard Herrman's score is one of his bests.  Incorporating a dizzying series of notes in the string section- musically achieving the effect of vertigo.  Later, Herrman brings out his lush, romantic melodies, with beautiful tones, but always with an underlying harmony of doom. Perhaps featuring one of the best scenes in all of film history-Hitch lets his brilliance of camera work, knowledge of Herrman's musical abilities, and the actor's/actress's skill, capture us in a moment in time never to be forgotten.

But there is much more going on beneath the surface of this movie, an emotional imbroglio suggested with a range of sublime methods that provides it with its real narrative thrust.

His films are instantly recognizable around the world.

Doing so, John gets dangerously obsessed with her and things starts to complicate. ",
325,17 February 2008,tonedeaf06,10, a masterpiece!!!,"""Vertigo"" is my favorite movie. Is it the best movie ever made? Perhaps not. It is more of a work of art from Hitchcock and, as been noted by others, a very personal film. This film is about compulsion, obsession and of having , what is to Scotty, the ideal woman in his grasp, only to lose her in tragic circumstances. It is also about guilt, bereavement and murder. Even after Madeleine's death, Scotty cannot let it go. He continues to search for a ""dead"" woman. He is almost willing to go to any lengths to recapture what was lost. But as the old saying goes...""be careful what you wish for""?",
326,27 September 2009,smellthecult-com-1,9, Paranoid thriller,"Considered by many to be Hitchcock's masterpiece, I found this tougher going than I expected. James Stewart plays John 'Scottie' Ferguson, an ex-detective who was forced out of The Force when an arrest gone wrong left him with a debilitating fear of heights. An old pal of his asks him if he wouldn't mind putting his former policing powers to use to tail his wife, who is acting in a most peculiar manner. He's not worried that she is having an affair, but is instead concerned as she has taken to wandering off and spending hours on end by herself. Reluctantly, Scottie agrees and, in one of the most taut scenes in cinema history, stalks her through the evocative streets of San Francisco. She winds up beneath the Golden Gate Bridge and throws herself into the water, our hero rushing to her rescue. Well, it's not long before the two are in love, and Scottie's life is taken on the kind of tangent that could only happen in a Hitchcock movie. Dark, oppressive and utterly compelling, this is only really marred by the 'love' angle which, inevitably, I find tiresome. When ageing stars and starlets gaze into each others eyes and profess undying love I tend to drift off, and maybe fifteen minutes of this movie delved into such forbidden areas, and that's why I've docked a point. That aside, this is majestic movie-making, with Hitchcock's peerless vision drawing anxiety and claustrophobia from the most mundane of circumstances. Things are helped along by a sumptuous score that swells and cascades, flowing over your senses and drawing you into the insanity on screen. Just magnificent.",
327,15 August 2001,the red duchess,10, Unfathomable.(spoilers),"It has become one of the cliches in talking about 'Vertigo' that it is Hitchcock's most personal work, a naked confession of his desires for blonde actresses in general, for Vera Miles (who was originally intended to play Madeleine/Judy) in particular.  In this model, Scottie Ferguson who makes over Judy Barton in the image of another woman and destroys her in process, is Hitchcock making over Kim Novak in the image of a pregnant Vera Miles. ",

It takes what could have simply been a very average story and transforms it into a fascinating look at the human condition and how it deals with grief. Hitchcock is one of the great auteurs of cinema and he shows us why with this film, he is constantly changing the tone of the film and yet it never feels muddled. He combines genres including, Romance, Drama and Thriller; this may not seem a huge achievement but it paved the way for many filmmakers of the future to mix genres. Jimmy Stewart has a very challenging role that I believe he plays perfectly, the subtle change from private-eye to hopeless romantic is actually believable. Kim Novak is also superb as a woman with much to hide. The ending was my only problem with the film, it feels incredibly sudden and more of an exit route for the writer as opposed to an actual conclusion to the film. Nevertheless, I would certainly recommend it to any film fans as a must watch film given how much it has influenced cinema since its release.",

And we tend to go out strange things if we have fear so that Hitchcock could be a member of the most famous supervisions. I think that there are some wonderful point in this film. First, shaft of the story is never shake. Of course, to change shaft is terrible and must not do. But I thought again that his film had unity. So it made me be easy to understand the story. For example, green often appeared, so I could notice that the color was key. Second, this film betrayed me in good meaning. I thought that Madeline killed herself first. However it was mistake. The deed was performance. Therefore Madeline was not Madeline. She was a completely different person. I had never thought like that. It was exciting for me, so it impressed me that scene. Maybe everyone also would do. Finally, silent scene was not even boring me. Usually, when the silent scene lasts, I come to be sleepy. However this film did not make me do that and attracted me!",

Well as far as I can tell, Vertigo was not that kind of 'brilliant classic' I heard about. It was a 2-hour cheese marathon without any suspense. The love-story featured in that movie is overly dramatized and absolutely horrible. There weren't any values that managed to impress me. Ironically Alfred Hitchcock defined the term ""MacGuffin"" and Vertigo was a single 2-hours long MacGuffin! There are many better movies which do not get the credit they deserve while Vertigo is called an instant classic.

It's great stuff that gets you on the edge of your seat right away. Yet, the rest of the movie isn't focused on the same kind of relentless suspense. Rather, it settles into its own odd mix of alluring investigation and ahead-of-its-time characterisation that constantly keeps you guessing as to what's next. It's always one step ahead of the audience, even when it seems to let them in on its secrets. It has a rather unconventional two-half structure that, essentially, hasn't quite been done since. It's unconventional through and through, actually. It subverts almost every expectation, especially when it comes to its protagonist. It's engrossing no matter how many times you watch it, in part thanks to its ambiguity. It's really layered, too. There's just this strange, almost mesmerising quality to the piece. It's entertaining and intriguing, an incredibly well-crafted picture from its opening frame. While it may not be as enjoyable as some of Hitchcock's other work, it's certainly among his best. 8/10",

Of course there were many more good too from the Master, but for someone who is not a movie buff and has no much time to waste discovering films, those three are far enough to get who AH really was. Kim Novak has never been so terrific, gorgeous, sensual, maybe because Hitch considered her only as a kettle or a sauce pan....

Hitchcock is one of the few directors that can manage this. Exceptional storytelling with Hitchcock's powerful camera work and a strong opening scene leading the way for a just as exceptional film. The plot twists are some of the best in film history. Even for Hitchcock, this is exceptionally well-crafted. The best part: when James Stewart is doing the private eye work on Kim Novak.

348,2 March 2009,barryrd,10," Vertigo, a powerful and beautiful movie","A double identity thriller to surpass all others, Vertigo draws viewers into the mind of one man and his obsession with the beautiful woman he is hired to follow. The plot: A detective named Scotty (James Stewart) is asked by a former college buddy to follow his wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), who he says is possessed by a personage from the past.
Scotty accepts the job with misgivings but he soon becomes as much a voyeur as a detective, as he falls madly in love.To Scotty, Madeleine is a beautiful and mysterious woman. She captivates him to the point where I had trouble distinguishing between reality and dreams. Vertigo plays with your mind that way because it is brilliantly crafted. While recovering from a serious fall brought on by vertigo, Scotty is longing for a change from his girlfriend and anchor Midge, played by Barbara Bel Geddes.
As Madeleine, Kim Novak never looked better. Madeleine's double Judy has speech and mannerisms quite different from Madeleine but Scotty tries to shape her into the image of Madeleine and comes very close to success. We want him to make it work but I mage vs. reality can lead into dangerous territory, as we find out.
The visuals of this movie are stunning from the opening credits, to the flashback scenes, to tours by car of San Francisco. The riveting female presence of Madeleine in the movie is captured early by close-ups as she passes by the camera. The viewer is drawn into Scotty's obsession and can feel the power of Madeleine's magnetism, when the camera closes in on her. How Hitchcock achieves this is one of the hallmarks of this powerful movie.
The vertigo is shown by a series of shots from high above ground level which gives us a sense of Scotty's harrowing fear of heights. When Scotty is hired to follow Madeleine, we tour San Francisco in a slow-moving vehicle up and down hills, past great public edifices and apartments. The film highlights the white plaster buildings set amid the greenery of the city and the blue and green colour of San Francisco Bay.
The music by Bernard Hermann is perfect, although there were parts in the movie where the orchestral music became jarring. This is a small point given the style, the beauty, and the story line of this mesmerizing movie. I don't think younger audiences are familiar with this movie, certainly one of Hitchcock's one or two best.",
349,22 November 2006,JKearse,10, Just how great is Vertigo?,"Alfred Hitchcock's greatest work stars James Stewart as a former policeman turn detective in 1950's San Francisco. As is typical with our favorite director, Hitchcock creates his art without cutting back on entertainment, which is why so many consider him motion pictures' greatest film-maker. First time and repeat viewers of Vertigo are compelled to continue viewing Hitchcock's film until the chilling, unexpected end. Vertigo's conclusion is anything but satisfying but rather a life-changing slap in the face. It is probably the greatest film ever made. Stewart and his costar Kim Hunter also give their greatest performances. Barbara Bel Geddes's small supporting performance is equally effective. Hitchcock's incredible eye for landscapes is never more keen as it is in Muir Woods, a California Mission, and around San Francisco. (By the way, the shots of the mission were taken from several missions and assembled together to create a nonexistent mission.)",

This is the result of a traumatic experience he had on the job. But he is assigned to observe a woman who is acting very strange according to her husband. Her husband claims she is possessed by her insane great-grandmother. During his investigation he see's how this could be true. Or it could just be a plot. He discovers more and more suspicious facts about the woman, but he also finds he is attracted to her. But this is just about halfway through the movie.

Nor does Judy-from-Kansas' previous sugar daddy, John's college chum Gavin, who has foisted her off upon John in an overly complicated plot to help himself to an ahead-of-its-time no-fault divorce. John, a completely amoral ""whited sepulcher,"" has no qualms about putting it to Judy when she's masquerading as Gavin's troubled wife, Madeleine.

The latter woman intones ""God have mercy""--as surely no one on the Corrupt Coast ever had had when poor deluded Judy was still alive--to close out this overwrought ""sex mystery"" (to use director Alfred Hitchcock's later genre description of MARNIE).

It is a complex story (inspired by a French novel by the Boileau - Narcejac couple) that can be described or interpreted on several levels - an impossible and slightly perverse love story, a reflection of the relationship between ideal and reality, a false detective plot (the viewer knows more than the heroe about halfway through the film) and a bogus ghost story. The cast includes two of the great stars of American cinema of the 1950s in some of the best roles of their careers. Visually the film is full of innovations and surprising effects, and the soundtrack (created by Bernard Herrmann, Hitchcock's composer partner) plays an important role. All the makings of a great success are here, and even if the film did not enjoy an enthusiastic reception on release (without being a flop), it has grown over time and is - rightly - regarded as one of the best productions directed by Hitchcock and one of the best films of the 1950s.",

Not only is the plot engrossing and the story told one that touches on many interesting and important themes, but the motifs employed throughout the film (the hairstyle employed by the woman in the picture in the art gallery and in other places throughout the film, the necklace, paintings, the old church building, the nuns, the grave, and agoraphobia and vertigo themselves as phenomenological experiences and psychiatric conditions) are nuanced, expertly deployed, and lend themselves to an even deeper analysis than the one provided here. I also found the contrast between John's ex-fiancé and the other woman he falls in love with to be an important contrast in the film as well. The score is amazing and the way that the sound and visual elements work together make it very clear why people say that Alfred Hitchcock was the master of suspense.",

374,22 July 1999,Liedzeit,8, Keep rewatching it,"There are some films that you somehow don´t like and that you watch every time they are on TV. For me Vertigo is a prime example. It is easy to see what is fascinating: the music by Herrmann the face of Jim Stewart the great sub plot with the down-to-earth friend Mitch played brilliantly by Barbara Bel-Geddes. (When I first saw it as an adult at the beginning of the eighties dozens of people started whispering ""Miss Ellie"" when she had her first scene.) Why did she end the engagement when she obviously still loves him? The thought of recreating your lost loved one. But at the same time the film is overlong (which is an euphemism for boring). You seem to see Stewart behind a wheel all the time. The plot seems to be too constructed. There is no hint of why in the world Judy should go through everything. Why not confess to John? So she started to love him only later? Why in the world should someone push a puppet down the staple? (Well, that was the troubling thought I had when I first saw the film as a kid. There should be a law against kids watching great movies. They have fun enough being kids and it spoils  the films for them when they watch them later.) Anyway I will watch it again and find out what makes this one ultimately a masterpiece or what it is that makes one think it might be one.",
375,3 June 2018,TheMovieDiorama,8," Vertigo is a masterful example in creatively blending mystery, suspense and romance.","Another film that is often regarded as ""the greatest movie of all time"" and many proclaiming ""Hitchcock's masterpiece"" which is quite a title considering his filmography. Whilst I don't think it's as good as some of his other work, it's definitely worthy of the eternal praise. A retired detective, who suffers with acrophobia, is hired to privately investigate a woman who is behaving strangely. It's told in a classic Hitchcock-ian narrative including several twists, taut suspense and a theme tune that will stay with you forever. Technically, this film is flawless. Hitchcock intricately utilises lighting to create perfect shadowing for shrouding ominous figures. The infamous use of his zooming technique to produce the vertigo effect was profound and increasingly heightened the suspense. Remembering that this was released back in 1958, it really has stood the test of time. Watching this for the first time now, I still felt the suspense and wonderment as if I was viewing this upon its initial release. And it's because of Hitchcock's directing techniques that allows his films to be invincible to time, Vertigo more than any others from his canon. A few famous scenes such as the kiss with a backdrop of crashing waves and the staircase climb shows how influential this romantic thriller is. Stewart, although slightly too old for this role, and Novak had decent chemistry with some fine acting. The twisted story does evoke themes of love and loss with some psychological details embedded. A man succumbing to the fixation of a woman, a prominent portrayal that only becomes more apparent after the plot twist. The pacing is very inconsistent, switching between rapid car following sequences to slow dull conversations that really don't add any necessary development to these characters, whilst occasionally running into some contrivances along the way. Is this Hitchcock's best? No. However it is a classic romance with masterful direction where the finest aspects come from the details, just not dizzyingly thrilling.",

It's the most beautiful and romantic film ever, but has an utterly black heart. That's why, like the ups and downs of the human heart, it's as much comic as it is tragic. The ending is perfect precisely because it is such a cop-out, leaving us as (and Scotty) just as stranded over the abyss as we were at the beginning. To love this movie you have to understand it. And if you don't, well, go watch North By Northwest with the other children.",
385,27 December 2011,sean-239-301625,2, Too slow becoming unbelievable at the end.,"Slow! Most of my Hitchcock experiences have been through his work on television. To which his twisted plots and portrayal of love lost can become somewhat repetitive. This film repeats the process. For me its only saving graces are the street scenes of 1950's San Francisco, the cars and the wide shots of the city. Overall there was one and a half hours of build up and then something happens. The last 30 minutes are quicker, showing irrational behaviour tempered with calculated obsession. Such far fetched obsession by Ferguson and submission by Judy would nowadays cause the womens lib movement to rear into a tidal wave. I can only wonder at this currently having a score or 8.5. I am not a devotee of Hitchcock and this film is one of the reasons why.",
386,12 June 2008,killservant,10, Hitchcock's haunting study of human obsession,"Vertigo is a masterpiece. There is no denying that. The entire film is as dizzying to watch as the fear that it tackles, from the whirling opening credits by Saul Bass to the deeply haunting romantic score by Bernard Herrmann. When I first watched 'Vertigo', I will admit that I didn't like it. I was expecting a typical thriller like so many others, such as Psycho and North By Northwest. This film is much deeper, and is very complex psychologically. Stewart gives a terrifying performance of a man stumbling deeper and deeper into a dream world of obsession, and Hitchcock's use of color is extraordinary, and this is shown in a surreal dream sequence that is more terrifying than any other. What is most startling about 'Vertigo' is its genuine emotion throughout. It is not to be classified as a traditional 'happy entertainment' film. So do watch this, and be bowled over by its genius, but you might need a stiff drink afterward.",
387,24 March 2014,rabidrobertfan,10," This Movie was Disappointing at First-Now, I Love It!","It's the movie that perfectly describes its name-Vertigo, the film often considered to be Hitchcock's masterpiece. The experience I had with this movie the first time I saw it was, pun-intended, vertigo-inducing. Vertigo was only the second Hitchcock film I saw and I wish somebody had warned me of what I was to expect. At the end, the first thing I said was ""holy crap."" If asked point-blank, I couldn't have been able to tell you whether I liked it or not because there were elements I liked and elements I didn't like but overall, it was an overwhelming experience and it may hold the record for the only movie I was ever afraid of. The plot is so tortuous, one really needs to view it multiple times to completely get the gist of it and become ""immune"" to it. A detective named Scottie Ferguson with a paralyzing fear of heights quits the San Francisco police force and then is hired by an old college buddy to follow the latter's wife, who has been displaying strange psychological behavior. Scottie becomes increasingly and dangerously obsessed with the cool blonde and ends up being driven to the brink of insanity. There are several things I love about this movie since as of this writing, I've seen it a total of five times. First and foremost, the acting is top-notch but then again, Hitchcock did get a top-notch actor in the always lovable Jimmy Stewart-well, he's actually not quite that lovable in Vertigo. Gone are the days of his ""aw-shucks"" persona in It's a Wonderful Life, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Rear Window. Stewart's performance in Vertigo is so complex and convincing, it disturbs me a bit-and it's a heck of a performance. In the beginning, he still retains a little of his old likable mannerisms but as the films progresses, he becomes darker and more agitated so that by the climax, his anger boils over to the point of him yelling at Kim Novak's character and throughout, his eyes have a crazed and tortured shine that I've never seen in any other film of his-and I've seen over twenty films of his. He completely pulls off the role of a necrophiliac sufferer of Freud's Repetition Complex and his habit of following Kim Novak-and later leering at women who bear a resemblance to her- are more than borderline stalker. This is really the only one of Jimmy Stewart's characters I don't like and if he can make me not like him, then I really must have some great evidence to support my statement of him being the greatest actor ever. But let's not forget Kim Novak's performance. She plays dual roles-which is really tough to pull off- and does it flawlessly. Anyone else in her role just would not have worked. Novak adds a certain haunting and hypnotic quality to the character of Madeleine that adds to her mystery and elusiveness. Also, I love the photography in this film-it's probably some of the most beautiful photography I've ever seen in a film period. There is a dreamlike quality and the pastel tone of the colors reminds me of a watercolor painting. Heck, it's so beautiful, it makes me want to go to San Francisco. The music is brilliant as well and almost makes you see swirling patterns. I think that Hitchcock truly captured lightning in a bottle with this movie and that there will never be another film like it. If I had to say anything against it, it would be just a personal thing. The nightmare sequence will probably always creep me out no matter how many times I see the movie. This movie is brilliant.",

390,24 August 2021,rcastl2335,1," A ""masterpiece"" of goofiness","The story is that Hitchcock blamed the failure of Vertigo on James Stewart's age.

During my first viewing of the film I was very surprise by the excellent mature and patient directing of Hitchcock,which was very different to the style that I had expected,due to seeing ""spoof"" versions of famous Hitchcock films,where they made it look as if the camera would find it impossible to stay in one place. Thankfully Hitch is actually the complete opposite,with only using shots of Fergusions Vertigo during moments where the character is at some of his weakest moments. Hitchcock also uses the camera to show the destructive breakdown for each of the characters,With the truly unforgettable dream sequence Hichcock does amazingly well at showing how much damaged Madeleine has done to Scotties mental state,although Hitch shows that Madeleine also has to pay a price,with a very daring ending,that probably most directors even now, would not choose.",

393,25 April 2000,mrsweeneytodd,10, Personal doesn't even describe(spoilers),"To start out, I am fascinated with this movie.  I love Hitchcock, and everything he has contributed to cinema, but something about this film transcends what he has contributed.  I have read the critiques of those who dislike it, and I can totally understand.  This is not Hitchcock's normal standard, it's not the edge of your seat thriller(well, not all of it), and the pace is dogged at points.  But when I sit back and watch this, I cannot help but sit back and be entranced by the pure beauty of this film.  The bridge shot, the redwoods, the revolving kiss, all are incredible, lasting images.  The delicately provocative and yet eerily haunting music is unforgettable.  And like these ideas, the theme of being haunted, plagued by some phantom ideal such as mislaid love that emcompasses every moment of your life, the obsession and self-mutilation that everyone endures because of it - every romantic can sympathize with these themes.  One thing that is often overlooked is the depth of Stewart's character, and the emotional heights which he is more afraid to fall from than tangible heights in his own life.  And when he DOES fall, and he realizes to what depths he has been tricked, he snaps, not realizing that Novak's character has as well fallen with him.  His depravity and obsession with the truth at the end as they climb the stairs is one of the greatest scenes in film - he overcomes his actual fear of heights and confronts his emotional downfall, just as the the personification of both his previous weaknesses and what helped him to overcome them.  The final image of Stewart standing atop that tower, the shadow of death tolling the bell as he looks down upon what he has lost to his vertigo, is so disturbing and haunting that it brings me to tears every time I watch it.  This is my favorite movie of all time, not simply because of any one specific element, but because it inspires in me something unexplainable, like looking at a painting or listening to poetry, only one-hundred times more potent.  I hope in another forty years the greatness of this film will be truly recognized by everyone, but if not, I'll still be watching it.",

The substance or plot is not riddled with complexity or has great layers but its the way that its told. Hitchcock is easily one of the greatest directors of all time and his brilliance shows in Vertigo. We see what he wants us to see. A man following a woman becomes an intense and harrowing journey because thats how we were meant to see it.

403,12 September 2021,prudhoeboy,10, SF Ghosts,"I always get a bit of a creepy feeling when I visit San Francisco, an old Victorian era city with so many graveyards from past generations they had to move them to Colma. Even the homes look like tomb stones. Vertigo, perhaps Hitchcock's best work, takes full advantage of SF as a setting for this haunting story. Monuments from the past, museums, art gallery, Coit Tower, the Redwoods and many others are used to weave the plot through. This is the last look of SF before it went hippy and very liberal. Men wore suits and women dressed up. Anyway, this haunting, iconic movie is a classic and is an easy 10. The only criticism I have of the movie is that once again, Jimmy Stewart looks a bit old for the part. My gosh, he makes a big issue out of Kim Novaks hair color in the movie. He could use some rinse himself. The movie has him as a retired detective so it kind of covers that issue too.",
404,8 November 2018,francpsantos,10," People say beauty is in the inside. In Vertigo, it's everywhere","Apparently there's a reason why, in a medium where everything is extremely subjective, this film is always on the top for so many people. If I'm allowed to say, it is truly objectively a masterpiece. Usually when I watch a movie there is always that one scene that sticks with me afterwards. A few minutes in, the scene at Ernie's kicks in and I think to myself: This is it. But then there's the whole pursuit scene, the museum, the nightmare sequence, the final transformation of Judy in Madeleine, and so on, and so on. Everything is so beautifully engineered to elevate the tantalization of Madeleine that one can't help to participate in Scottie's obsession. James Stewart is stellar, as usual, but Kim Novak can just merge an uneasy eerie feel with that strong magnetism, while still keeping it convincingly real. And of course it had to come to that end. After all, life goes in cycles, right? All of this the fruit of an extremely well designed plot by the one and only Master of Suspense. Let him take the credit he deserves, but don't forget that the man surrounded himself with the right people. The cinematography by Robert Burks is, to this day, the closest I have seen to the meaning of ""every frame a painting"". I mean, I had never realized I wanted so badly to visit San Francisco (which almost feels like character in itself). And don't get me started one the score. Many say that, since Herrmann couldn't conduct the orchestra in this movie, it doesn't have the same feel. But honestly, it doesn't really matter to me. It is so well embedded into the plot, the characters, the scenery, that, just like the city of San Francisco, feels like a conscious character. Most of the times, this may go unnoticed to a great deal of people, but I dare anyone to try to watch this movie with no soundtrack and I assure you it won't be nearly as striking.",

408,15 October 2007,Rick_McAuner,10, An amazing film that takes the viewer beyond their expected destination.,"Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film Vertigo is an adventure into the human mind. Scottie Ferguson, the main character, has to deal with his vertigo. Hitchcock takes an interesting turn in his storytelling when the viewer believes the tale is through. His use of the color green plays a very prominent roll throughout the film. The dialog is well thought out, but more importantly Hitchcock's use of vocal silence during the chase scenes between Madeleine and Scottie really brings a level of suspense normally not seen in today's films. Generally television shows rely heavily on dialog to tell the twenty minute story that the writers have created. Hitchcock's style allows him to fully demonstrate his vision to the audience. He takes the time to completely elaborate the suspense in various scenes, bringing the emotional draw to a peak. I enjoyed the twist where the film seemed to be over after Madeleine dies. The story had all its loose ends tied up, everything seemed to have fallen neatly in place for what was a good movie. Then it continues and Hitchcock runs with a continuing storyline that builds impressively off the first. He successfully follows through in giving a compelling presentation of the human psyche as seen in Scottie's development and decline in Vertigo. I highly recommend this film since it is a masterpiece of what film should be. Hitchcock's brilliance shines during the entirety of this picture, ranging from the great camera setups and impressive panning shots that really show off San Francisco to the simplicity in the colors of a scene. Hitchcock was very talented in bringing together the cast, sounds, images, and his vision to create this masterpiece on film.",

Hitch used to say ""let the audience worry about how Stewart gets down from the roof"" but we still worry as to why a very old (esp. in the 1950s) man is obsessed with a young woman who could almost be his granddaughter? And why is he contentedly living alone in San Fran. on the cusp of the gay revolution? His final fantasy is remaking Kim Novak over like his own Barbie just to be able to stomach looking at her in the end. I'd say this is a classic closeted gay man using an ex- girlfriend as a beard while he plays couturier to his doll (Recall Clifton Webb in 'Laura'?) and then bored with her tosses her off the roof (typical teenage boy stuff).

Some of the cut scenes, the photography are really landmarks in film.  My favorite is when Scottie is in the hotel room with the girl embracing, the camera moves around them; the livery stable scene is in the background, then we're back to the hotel room.  I'm not so sure it's worthy of being #29 at IMDB.  But it is pretty darn good how the writers & Hitchcock were able to blend the supernatural element (through the story line as well as the cinematography) with the logical explanation at the end (sort of an uber-Scooby Doo episode ;-).",

Not only is the casting, music, and direction perfect, its also a brilliant, but disturbing look into a mans obsession of a woman. Even if the first part of the film wasn't already excellent, you have Scottie(James Stewart) transforming Judy Barton(Kim Novak) into Madeleine, and his near descent into madness(?). No one but Hitchocock could do it as good as this. An interesting thing to note, is that it was based on a French book by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac called ""D'Entre Les Morts"". These two writers had provided the original novel for Henri-Georges Clouzot's (the French master of suspense) ""Les Diaboliques"". A haunting film that demands multiple viewings.",

Rear Window was absorbing, and Psycho and North By Northwest speak for themselves, but this is a film which has you intrigued from the word go, yet you're never overly sure as to why.

428,14 September 2006,ericolsen1953,10, Why did this one flop?,"Almost perfect suspense-flick, done by the master himself. And, a super music score by Bernard Herrmann. Both a leading man & lady who are just the right fit for their roles. Yet, Vertigo flopped at the box-office when first released in 1958. Maybe it was the cartoon scenes that Hitch tried out for the first time, and then dropped for good. Maybe some scenes dragged on too long, like the coroner's inquest. Other than those little criticisms, this film still does it for me. It's great fun watching Scottie (Jimmy Stewart) watching rich society-dame Madeleine (Novak) as she wanders about San Fran feeding her neurotic obsession with a long-dead ancestor. (San Francisco is always such an ideal venue for mysteries and dramas). After Scottie saves Madeleine's life once, he's unable to save it on a second suicide attempt and he goes into a deep funk, complete with Chuck Jones-style illustrations! What astounds most is Stewart recognizing Novak walking home to her rooming house after she'd died in a jump from a church bell-tower. Then, it's eerily fun as we watch Stewart acting really strange...we think he's going bananas, but in reality, his well-honed policeman's instinct is working behind the scenes all the time and he's several steps ahead of the audience until the last scene with a surprise ending.",

You never expect her to fall off the roof at the very end, but this helps cure Jimmie Stewart's ""Vertigo."" Bernard Herrmann does a fabulous job once again with the musical score. There is deep passion written in the music, and it enhances the mood of the film to a drawing and clenching feeling. The whole entire movie, you are trying to understand why Kim Novac is walking around as if in a daze. You think that she is possessed, but later you realize that it is all a gimmick.

It begins lethargically, laden with exposition and weighty dialogue, before morphing from a thriller into a twisted love story that leans so far into the metatextual that it borders on total self-absorption. It's all uncomfortably chauvinistic, not helped by a huge age gap between the two leads. The letter as a storytelling device remains noticeably clunky - written only to be torn up, obviously existing solely for the audience's benefit, despite the twist practically being spelled out later - especially when immediately following an already-dodgy flashback. Taken at face value, the entire plot is overly contrived and unbelievable; an old school friend, out of contact for years, is chosen to take the fall for an elaborate plan barely worthy of an Agatha Christie novel, revolving around supernatural explanations conveniently supported by even those not involved in any trickery, and only foiled by love, specifically through a careless choice of jewellery.",

437,23 January 2017,drqshadow-reviews,6," Fabulous, Nuanced Filmmaking Tinged with a Strong Sense of Discomfort","Jimmy Stewart's fourth and final collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock, starring as John Ferguson, a detective whose life unravels when he develops acrophobia amidst a rooftop foot chase. A troubling picture in many ways, from its complex, effectively unsettling filmmaking to the distressing changes undertaken by Ferguson in the third act. Hitchcock is, of course, a master of the craft and there's much to be learned from his efforts behind the camera (the now-infamous dolly zoom, tricks with lighting and foreshadowing, a casual pace that somehow never seems to grow stale) but also plenty to wonder about the man himself from the actions of his on-screen counterpart. In a Hitchcock film, it's nothing new for a visibly older gentleman to effortlessly draw the affections of a young blonde. Stewart's no exception in this film, pulling buxom Kim Novak (twenty-five years his junior), but his particular brand of obsession quickly grows dark and insistent, leading to some very squeamish scenes as he draws close to unraveling the conspiracy that's ensnared them both. Of course, Ferguson ultimately pays a price for this turn, but his greater judgment is never laid out on the screen. Rather, it's abruptly left to the scrutiny of the viewing audience, with more than a nudge to suggest he may not be completely without alibi. Expertly concocted and tragic from a bird's-eye perspective, but worrying from a more introspective one.",

James Stewart was a lock-in for the time, as he had previously starred in ""Rear Window."" The result is timeless. It is a suspenseful thriller with many twists.

448,3 September 2001,Dble07jamesbond,10, Superb,"Vertigo is the ultimate film.  It is my favorite film and in my opinion should have been rated much higher in the AFI's top 100 movies of all time list.  It outdoes Psycho and North By Northwest even though those are superb films as well.  I realize that Psycho set standars for years to come, and North By Norhtwest set standards for script-wrting, directorial techniques, etc....but Vertigo was simply a masterpeice made.  Nothing was revolutionized (except Hitch's technique of falling bodies), but instead a wonderful movie was made that can show just how much the human mind can toy with feelings and emotions.  Not only is the cinematography and acting remarkable in this film, but the heart-breaking score by the great Bernard Herrmann would also have to be the high point in this film.  When you listen to the score, you feel all the emotions that are running through the film and through the charachters head.  Never before could this have been expressed in a film, and it has never been done again in film.  There have been many attempts and superb films as well that have tried to express the same emotions--but none have succeeded more then Vertigo.  This was Alfred Hitchcocks personal favorite of his own--and I do not blame him.  All elements come together:  James Stewart and Kim Novak's electrifying performances, Bernard Herrmann's legendary score, the superb scenery of San Francisco, and the love and passion expressed through the chracters by a remarkable script.  The thing to top off Vertigo is the scene where Judy comes out of the bathroom and reveals herself as this illusion woman (Madeline).  There is so much passion in this scene it truly has to be one of the most remarkable scenes in the history of film.  When one takes all these elements into hand, Vetigo can without a doubt be considered one of the 3, if not the greatest, movie of all time.",

451,18 December 2017,Loachee,10, Jimmy Stewart at his best,"Vertigo has proven to be a timeless classic that has pioneered at least one major filming technique - the Dolly Zoom. With this effect, developed by Irmin Roberts, Hitchcock was able to show the audience the effect of Scottie's acrophobia. The mystery of the story easily captures your imagination, peaking with a famous Hitchcockian twist near the end. Stewart plays a believable and extremely sympathetic character, who is (spoiler) being manipulated without his knowledge the entire film. What starts out as a light-hearted mystery becomes a dark tragedy of Shakespearian proportions. One of the final scenes in which Stewart's character confronts the truth is absolutely heartbreaking. By this time in the movie, we are fully engrossed in the pure intentions of Scottie, and we wish to see him succeed. Once we step back, however, we realize that the ""villain"" has very similar intentions as the ""hero"" in the story. There is one shot in particular which will stand out forever in the minds of audiences and critics. Scottie embraces ""Madeleine"", the camera begins to rotate, the background changes completely in the same shocking shot as the wonderful score plays.

The end twist tried to compensate for it but it's way much more predictable after the main twist spoils it all. Though personally I like Rear Window better than this movie, I think Vertigo can still make it to the great movies list because this movie serves a tale that is more focused on the psychological side of the mystery thriller.

But... I can say that the film is Stewarts way to the death, you can see this from the beginning. There are no way he ever could have been saved. I can say that Stewart (as in REAR WINDOW) looks like a surrogate for Hitchcock. And that is seems to be Hitchcocks most personal film. Actually it seems to be the reality of that time, where Hitchcock desperatly looked for a new Grace Kelly, and drive his actresses to madness with his obsession. Therefore it was naturally that Vera Miles should have played Madeleine/Judy. She was in a another place, as Tippi Hedren later should be, now it was the most a-normal Hitchcock heroine one can imagine, Kim Nowak, who played the part. It seems to be perfect that a ""wrong"" girl has the part. And that she was never a good a actor is not a problem. Yet it had been intresting to see, how Miles would have been in the role, perhaps it was to close the the real world.

Almost all of them have special atmosphere that at least works at me. But Vertigo is different. I didn't expect much of it, but that was the point. You play the film, expect nothing, and it's masterpiece! Alfred kept us during the film in suspense, expectations, and of course many questions. But in the end, Hitchcock answered all of (at least my) questions, and completed my expectations. What's so special about this film? It does make sense, it makes you ask yourself questions or create combinations why this happened, and so on. Definitely worth watching, even because of it's length - 2 hours 8 minutes 26 seconds.

In 1998 the American Film Institute broadcast its list AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies, ranking Vertigo in the 60s. In 2007 they rewrote their list, moving Vertigo to the top 10- specifically #9- making it Hitchcock's highest ranking film on the list. At the Academy Awards it was nominated for art direction and sound but was otherwise ignored. It wasn't even in the running for Best Picture or Best Director.

478,7 August 2012,ken_bethell,6," Nostalgic, nothing more","It was after I heard that Vertigo had replaced Citizen Kane as 'Best Movie of all Time' that I pondered as to whether I had actually seen this film. This was curious as I had no difficulty in remembering 'Kane' despite having only seen it once some 35 years ago. Since I could not recall missing any other James Stewart picture of that era or any of the other big productions of 1950s I assumed that I had seen it but would view it again. I watched it last night and my instincts were correct. I had forgotten this film because it is forgettable! In fact the only memorable thing about the film was the San Francisco skyline which had become beautifully enhanced by its conversion to BluRay. I have never been a great Hitchcock fan for the very reason that his films tend to be over-stylised and Vertigo is no exception. No great acting accolades either in fact dialogue seem to be a secondary consideration to the visual enactment of Stewart's character's mental decline. The film could easily have been a silent film. One critic commented on being fascinated by the complexity of this multi-layered psycho-drama. Uhmm, really. The ending was pure David Lynch - not difficult to see where he got his inspiration, but it was inadequate for a movie lasting beyond two hours. For lovers of this movie genre I would recommend 'The Woman in the Fifth'. Don't be put off by its low rating in IMDb. It is fine example Pawel Pawlilowski's direction and Ethan Hawke is excellent as the mentally-bewildered American adrift in Paris. Back to Vertigo and what more can I say? This film and others of its period have garnered praise well beyond their station by virtue of the current nostalgia boom. My criterion for deciding how good a film is is whether or not it stands the test of time - does it look dated? This film does, as does 'From Here to Eternity' but 'On the Waterfront' doesn't.",

The story is an incredibly disturbing and complex. The screenplay is disturbing, complex, layered, and compelling screenplay, and the writing is extremely suspenseful. Jimmy Dean gives his best performance and really gives off an aura of anxiety and fear in the disturbing case he goes through. His line deliverance and facial expressions are great. Kim Novak also gives off an incredibly compelling and powerful performance. The cinematography is great with some beautiful shots of the Golden Gate Bridge and more.

Still, the twisting and turning plot is genuinely engaging, and the twist is a genuine mind bender, although I feel it being revealed at the beginning of the final act is perhaps a misstep (Hitchcock himself wanted to move it to the end after the film was completed as he felt it came too early, and I agree).

The film runs 128 minutes, but feels like 240 while it pursues ultimately unimportant mysteries involving long-dead non-characters.  The logic-defying plot, as many have pointed out, is convoluted to the point that it makes almost no sense, and the abrupt ending comes out of nowhere.  The ending is so bizarre that I couldn't help but burst out laughing the first time I saw it.  Stewart's performance is OK, but his character borders on the psychotic, and one can't help but wonder why Novak didn't just tell him to get lost.  Barbara Bel Geddes turns in a nice performance, and then abruptly disappears for the last half of the film.  Herrmann's score is noteworthy, but not as memorable as those of ""Psycho"" and ""North By Northwest.""

489,22 August 2000,paul.goodall,9, Masterpiece of cinema that is still unequalled!,"Well, what can one say that has not already been said about this undisputed Hitchcock masterwork. Having watched most of the Master's films post-Rope, I had contented myself that North By Northwest would never be beaten, until I clapped eyes on this strange, neurotic, surreal, romantic, haunting drama. Never before in the cinema has there been a story that could wrench at the heart and leave the viewer shaken by its power. Stewart, the one-time All-American Hero of Capra, gives his greatest screen performance as the admittedly sickly minded cop smitten with the mysterious Kim Novak, who never again would get a role this good. Both stars exhume passion, almost burning the celluloid of the print, and Hitch never once loses focus of the story. His surprise revelation of the plot about 2 thirds of the way in may destroy the suspense but it increases the tension in the viewer. HE doesn't know her real identity and SHE only wants him to love her for who she is, not because he is in love with a dead woman who transfixed him. For me the final thirty minutes are probably the most poignant moments the screen has to offer. When the film ends, the viewer is shattered by the tragedy, but goes away enriched with what the cinema can offer, but cannot even come close to achieving again. For me, Vertigo is the best film I have ever seen and, no matter how many times I see it, I still come away with the same reaction - goosebumps and a lump in the throat. Cinema alchemy on a grand scale and Hitch is king of directors!",

We have the suspense and of course the unusual and perhaps implausible storyline. This was my first Barbara Bel Geddes film and I really liked her here. Stewart is of course solid and dependable as usual. As for Novak, I'm torn about her performance but will come down on the side of she does a fine job. One really has to suspend reality a bit to truly engage with the movie, otherwise it's hard to imagine Stewart's character not realizing sooner than he does what's up with both of Novak's characters.

I have always felt that Hitchcock new what he was doing by spooking Kim Novak by telling her that Vera Miles was his real choice for the film. Kim Novak was insecure all during the filming and its shows!

Many cite the scene in the small hotel as a pivotal part of the plot, the point where Scotty (Jimmy Stewart) has finally lost himself to his compulsion.  Kim Novak plays her character exactly as Hitchcock intended and she was perfectly cast.  She never came up to this level again in her career.

I thought I had seen Vertigo before but I had not. So I went to see it on the big screen in a classic film series. Well...I've been Hitchcocked. There were times I thought I was losing my mind. The film is mind numbing and I do not know whether that is good or bad. Every time I thought the film was ending, it kept going. Unlike some classic films, I didn't feel like Vertigo has aged well. I felt like parts of it come across as incredibly campy now and cheesy including the animation of Johnny's dream sequence. The film is appropriately haunting as you would expect from Hitchcock and the twist for me was actually a lot of fun, although again it seemed completely implausible. It seemed like Vertigo tried to be about five different genres of film and certainly covered a gambit of concepts. Obsession, lust, murder, the supernatural, reincarnation, and all with the opening scene of a detective afraid of heights. I think I would need a student of film to explain to me what on earth his vertigo had to with the film whatsoever. Yes, it ended up playing a role in the climax but was it necessary?

I will ignore here the fact that this film is so dated that the sexist tropes are laughable and annoying to watch, especially when Scottie orders around the women on the dress and hairstyle for Judy so that she will look like someone else, but it was filmed in a different era after all.

522,27 August 2006,dpoppyman-1,10, moviedom's most tragic characters,"Vertigo contains dozens, if not hundreds of nuances that can easily be overlooked when we view it casually. One thing which seems to be unnoticed which is very obvious is the fact that Scottie, Madeleine/Judy, and Midge constitute possibly the most tragic triangle ever portrayed. Midge, in love with a man who doesn't live in the real world, had to end their ""engagement"" unfulfilled. Tries later to enter his fantasy world by superimposing her face on Carlotta's portrait...with disastrous results. Then watches her love in a near catatonic state realizing that he will NEVER be in her world and wanders down the hallway, disappearing into darkness forever. Scottie, the pragmatist, who chases his fantasy to depths unheard of. Losing himself, everything and everyone in his life. Dabbling even in necromancy and attempted resurrection, not to mention domination and manipulation in the extreme. The ultimate subversion of one human being to the will of another to the destruction of all. When Hitchcock shows him teetering at the top of the tower, he is truly suffering from the ultimate form of vertigo, suspended between life and death. Unable to fully live or to find the release of final death. Truly a tragic, doomed figure of Shakespearian, perhaps even Biblical, proportions who has left behind him a wake of loss, disappointment, loneliness and death. A true aggressive annihilator of all he surveys. Then there is Judy. Scottie's equal in every way except that her obsession with destruction is focused mainly on herself. Manipulated by the murderer Gavin Elster, she gladly jumps from the frying pan into the fire to die (twice!) at the hands of Scottie Furguson. She gives herself over entirely to HER obsession and willingly evaporates as a human being just to complete her fantasy. The scene in which she allows Scottie to change her hair and submits to his will (if I let you, will that do it? Will you love me?) is possibly the most tragic movie scene I have ever witnessed. This film is a gold mine. A film-making master at his most revealing and insightful. Hitchcock's films have suspense and thrills, sure. But underneath are great love stories and, yes, tragedy too.",

The movie takes a while to get going- after the first couple of viewings, I can fast forward or do a crossword puzzle for the first 20-30 minutes of the movie without worrying about missing anything spectacular, but once it does, it soars.  The performances are wonderful, especially James Stewart, who is mesmerizing as the haunted detective. Hitchcock, almost always a master with the camera, supports the acting with wondrous shots that add to the mystery of the movie.  While some have criticized the movie for a lack of mystery, I believe they miss the point. The mystery of the movie is the relationship between Stewart and Novak, not any particular plot element.  Without giving away the plot, let's just say the viewer is allowed to understand what is going on before the climax, but I think that heightens the interest in how the Stewart/Novak characters will play out their roles in this psychological drama.  This movie is not exactly the feel-good hit of the summer, as it is painted in very dark colors. The movie's essence is about guilt, self-hatred, and a quest for redemption that spills over into obsession.  That is why, even though the ""mystery"" in the plot is revealed before the end of the movie, that becomes incidental to what is really being discussed by Hitchcock.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, even if you don't care for psychological dramas, just for the Bernard Hermann score.  The film, however, offers much more, more than any other film you will see.",

In Vertigo, there are many something expresses vertigo. When Scottie is caught by something, an object likes appears that likes vertigo. For example, Madeleine's hair, she rolls up her hair, and a spiral staircase. I also notice preparation. Scottie has a stick. When Midge and Scottie are in her room, Scottie finds a bra and he points it by his stick. This scene expresses sex. I think Hitchcock likes preparation.",

Today I watched it through the eyes of a 50 year old man. This is quite different and changes my opinion, and what I am viewing.
Alfred Hitchcock was angered by the performances of the two leads, was angry at the studio, and the critics. I think the leads were perfectly cast. Jimmy Stewart had to be a man we believed would believe anything, when under the spell of Kim Novak. She had to be both beautiful and approachable. Cold, yet a woman you would want to wrap your arms around.
We are allowed to enjoy the story more, knowing that Jimmy Stewart would be duped. We were allowed to watch Scottie and Madeleine, just waiting for the lie. Perhaps the only disappointment is the lie was revealed too early. The events too dramatic to be true.
The epic scale, and opulence of the film made it impossible to ever be profitable. And that was indeed the bigger lie, the one Hitchcock wanted the rest of us to believe.",

It definitely is a film that exists in the universe of Hitchcock films (a man on the run, or falsely accused, or seeking the truth). I promise you will be drawn in.

546,31 March 2021,robfollower,10, Vertigo(1958),"One of Jimmy Stewart's acting strength was his nervous demeanor and sense of angst he was brilliant IMO at this type of emotional depth through out his career. In this film he was able to show his sense of obsession and a lost soul/ star-crossed lover to perfection in my eyes that I do not think an other actor would have brought to the film. Secondly Kim Novak with very little theatrical training was sensational. She was a naturally shy, insecure woman which helped her in this film to bring a sense of otherworldly-ness to her role as Madeleine Elster. And as Judy Barton the girl from the wrong side of the tracks Kim was totally believable .. Novak in her Double role as Madeleine Elster /Judy Barton she was able to manifest the same sense of doom and vulnerability and as a lost soul/ star-crossed lover that I don't know if other actresses would have been able to convey as well as Kim. Because of the unparalleled writing and brilliant acting by Kim Novak , when Judy Barton finally get her poetic justice / comeuppance I believed every second of her portrayal of Kims character in the movie.

550,28 March 2021,douglasmcbroom,5, Color It Dull,"Hitchcock himself said he miscast both of his leads: Novak (lacking the chops) and Stewart (too old). He was absolutely correct about Novak, who delivers a wooden performance for the ages. Hitchcock liked to use the word ""stillborn"" for a film that didn't work and it certainly applies to Novak's performance. As for Stewart, why is an older man not allowed to lust for a younger woman? Stewart is one of our all-time best and he is at the top of his game here. Barbara Bel Gedes is terrific as 'Midge.' But neither the actors nor Hitchcock, can overcome this overly-long, overly-wrought screenplay. And absolutely nothing can overcome the absurdly overly-dramatic score. The score alone could sink this film. Early in the film Stewart's character makes a face at the music playing in Midge's apartment; he was on to something. I recognize that this is an important film, which might explain the critics near universal love for it (although, note Variety's dissenting original review), in terms of the use of lighting and color, and for its invention of the 'trombone' effect to create the feelings of vertigo. But that is film school stuff, not movie audience entertainment. So teach it reverently in school, but watch it critically and with lots of snacks.

First there's the mystery surrounding Madeleine's 'possession', then the love story between her and Scotty, then the mystery surrounding her death, and then the love story between Scotty and Judy, and then - finally - the completion of the mystery. Too much flip-flopping between the various mysteries and love stories. I also thought that Scotty's vertigo should have been more incorporated into the film - it shows up once at the beginning, once in the middle, once at the end, and that's it. Still, Stewart is great and Novak is gorgeous and fantastic in her dualish role, and it's fantastically directed, of course. I would have loved it if it had followed the promise shown in the opening scene, but alas, only the trippy dream sequence and the stuff in the bell tower does so. Still a pretty good film, though.",

I'd seen it but didn't remember it as anything special. And having watched it again to make sure, I can only say it's a demonstration of the way critics, having once fixated on something, can talk themselves and each other into thinking it's far more complex and profound than it is. Viewing it as a mere layman - someone who primarily wants to be entertained, is only peripherally interested in the technicalities of film-making, and not at all in critical theory - it's contrived, overwrought and melodramatic. Stories that hinge on someone looking just like someone else are okay for Norman Wisdom - I suppose - but impossible to take seriously. And come on, who really thinks this is better than Psycho (never mind anyone else's work)? Psycho is superior in every way: looks, story, tension, shocks, acting and, especially, music.

Some of my favorite movie shots of all time are in this movie. The shot where Kim Novak is at the San Francisco Bay with the bridge over her, the shot when her and Jimmy Stewart kiss for the first time, all really cool stuff.

But whereas Shyamalan had the good, for lack of a better word, sense to end The Sixth Sense right after the big twist, in Vertigo the big twist is stuck in the middle somewhere and by the time the film finally wraps up the impact of that big moment has been lost.

At the same time, you struggle with crippling acrophobia so badly that it threatens to bring the whole case down. This is Scottie's dilemma and boy is it a ride right into hell. Hitchcock was, and always will be, the master of suspense and psychological horror. Without ever being gratuitous or obvious, he knows visually how to tap into our worst fears.

She is acting strange and he rescues her on more than one occasion. Things turn bad though when she ascends a church spire, and he is unable to follow her due to his condition. Frozen by fear he sees her plunge to her death from the rooftop. Later, after the dust has settled and Gavin is receiving treatment in a sanatorium, Scottie can't shake the case. One day he runs into somebody who looks exactly like Madeleine but claims to be Judy Barton.

Its breathtaking use of colour and camera work to tell the story is excellently anchored by Bernard Herrman's majestic score and some masterful performances by James Stewart and Kim Novak. The film perfectly conveys the theme of voyeurism, thanks to Hitchcock's amazing use of the shot-reverse-shot structure and eye-line matches, to place us inside the head of Scottie, who we begin to discover may not be the person whom we should be rooting for. The themes that 'Vertigo' explore are definitely ahead of their time, and it is confounding that Hitchcock actually managed to sneak them into this studio film. The story takes some genuinely unexpected turns and Hitchcock cleverly allows the audience to be one-step ahead of the characters, in order to create tension and excitement. Although the film does include some heavy exposition, Hitchcock's use of visual storytelling (especially in the first act) makes up for it, and this makes the film require much more thought than many from its time. My main issue with the film is its somewhat quick conclusion. A little more time to digest what is happening would have made the ending more satisfying. Still, 'Vertigo' is definitely a great film and, in my opinion, Hitchcock's best. 8/10",

For example, one of the things that Hitchcock knew how to do great was to tastefully showcase the beauty of a woman as opposed to letting her simply be sexual eye candy. (To put it into modern context: girls in modern blockbusters come across the same as any girl next to a car in a magazine. whereas in a Hitchcock film they feel more like they stem from a painting).

While I watched several times, various ideas passed through my mind and some interrogative points were left. First of all, I found various interesting points in this film. It repeats the same story. Although sometimes lines are changed in the first and second halves, the same story is repeated twice. In spite of it, why do we lose interest? I think this is because of a good organization made by Alfred Hitchcock. While this is a suspenseful film, he reveals a secret in the middle of the story. The story is suspense told by Scottie at first, but it becomes a love story which is told by Judy in the latter of the story. I think because the similar story is written from a different viewpoint, we don't get tired of it. Finally, I totally recommend this film because it has a nice structure and we can study a lot of things from it. This film expresses various issues such as moral matter, fetishism, occultism and so on. These are complexly intertwined and formed a large spiral. If we watch it only one time, we don't understand its good point because, as you know, its theme is death and it's not comfortable. However, if we watch it several times and consider what Hitchcock wants to tell us and the meanings of each scene. This film is of course good not only for people who study films but also for general people who want to enjoy films.",

But, this is an exception as an unemployed bitter critic goes up against a film considered amongst the best of all-time. What was a slightly panned movie at first, Vertigo eventually established itself as one of the top masterpiece films from Hitchcock and one of the greatest movies ever. Here is where the praise ends. Vertigo is two parts excellent, and one part draggy. What started out as a spellbinding mystery with few clues as to where it's going, transported into a frustrating psychological thriller that took way too long to conclude. Alfred Hitchcock is a master director, but the script revealed all its trick cards much too soon, leaving us with nothing more than an ace of spades in the third act.",

At times we get the feeling that the scenes are too slow or prolonged more than what is required. What the Judie does in the end is enough to give a shock at the end of the movie but does have a bad effect on the movie. It doesn't make much sense that she suddenly jumps out. And most important the necklace that gives away the mystery is not very convincing. It was too stupid of Judie to wear it for a dinner with Scott.

And as Mullen jumped down on the top of the tower, was judged to commit suicide, Mullen 's husband got the legacy, Ferguson who fell in love with Mullen was desperate, and as a witness confirmed that Mullen committed suicide by jumping off the building, everything seemed to follow The development of traditional film noir. Ferguson should find himself being used by his former classmates, using his fear of heights to help his classmates complete evil plans, and then he will have to work hard to find evidence and truth and bring the former classmates to justice. But Hitchcock did not use this hand-to-catch routine, but instead changed the audience's perspective from the male host to the female host, as he did in ""The Horror,"" and the replacement bridge was love.

So, without going into plot, Vertigo has three features which set it apart for me... Vertigo captures a snap shot of San Francisco which acts as more than an incidental backdrop for a movie.  Hitchcock fell in love with the Bay City and had decided years before he would film a thriller spanning its hilly streets and monuments. Second, Herrmann's soundtrack is among the most haunting and memorable of any movie.  Rarely has another soundtrack so successfully created a mood that a movie would have lacked otherwise. Finally, for me, the overall dreamy milieu of Vertigo not only sets it apart from other Hitchcock thrillers, but also makes it one of those films that haunts and grows in my conscience as time passes.  When first released, Vertigo received lukewarm appraise from audiences and critics alike.  Seen as Hitchcock's most personal endeavour, Vertigo has gradually been elevated to the rank of timeless classic.  I envy anyone who views it for the first time.",

Over the years, Vertigo has become Hitchcock's ""usual masterpiece"" sometimes even surpassing Psycho, and I think that the debate has a good reason for existing. Psycho was and still out of the two the most influential and the most accessible film. Vertigo talks more about Hitchcock as a man and as a director, especially concerning women.
Another great aspect of Vertigo's that it addresses a genre not often explored in films, which I would call ""psychological romance"". Rather than focusing on the private eye part of the story, it tells how James Stewart's character fell in love/lust with a woman that didn't exist and how in return, Judy, the woman's impersonator, fell in love with that man.",

698,26 November 2009,iam-774526,10," It is the viewers' attachment with the film that makes ""Vertigo"" a true masterpiece...","Alfred Hitchcock is considered to be one of the best directors ever put footsteps on the earth. His one of most notable film ""Vertigo"" (1958) is undoubtedly a masterpiece. Many of the critics keep Vertigo at the top of their list. At the time of 1st release the movie got mixed review comments (like most of the Hitchcock movies) and never got any significant awards (naturally). Later it has been re-evaluated and unanimously loved by all. The movie is about a private detective (Scottie – played by James Stewart) who will be hired by one of his old friends to follow the friend's wife (Madeleine – played by Kim Novak). No, she is not cheating her husband. But everyday she used to take her husband's car and roams about the city randomly; but it seems she could not recall it - she don't even know about it. So Scottie's (our hero) job is to see what she does throughout the day. Hitchcock had an awesome ability to attract all sort of viewers. No one else could have been able to keep suspense throughout the film like him. It is probably because he could make the viewers to be a character of his film. In this film also we, the viewers, takes the place of Scottie when he follows her by car, keep a close eye on what she is doing. Thus Hitchcock made the viewers to become a part of ""Vertigo"". Viewers become active characters of the movie. Scottie has vertigo. If you search dictionary you will get the meaning: ""A sensation of whirling or falling"". But Salman Rushdie once told that ""Vertigo is the conflict between the fear of falling and the desire to fall"". This definition probably fits better in context of this movie. A fellow policeman of Scottie died falling from a roof while they were chasing a criminal. That policeman actually was trying to save Scottie's life. Since then Scottie had developed his acrophobia. The movie starts with that incident. After that he has been hired by his friend, he saves life of Madeleine once and in unavoidable circumstances yes, he falls in love with her. (""Falls"" in love! How appropriate is the expression in this movie!!!) I will not spoil your viewing by telling more. In the middle there is a twist. Near the end of the movie we see Scottie has overcome his vertigo. But that incident is followed by another one – very similar to the 1st scene of the movie – someone falls from the top and dies. The 1st incident creates the vertigo of Scottie; the 2nd incident is closely related with the way he has overcome his vertigo. Will the 2nd incident create another vertigo in Scottie's head? Hitchcock did not provide us the answer. The whole movie is like an endless spiral staircase. As the movie progresses we fall more and more into the spiral. We see 3 people die in the movie – all of them by falling from top. I have told that the 1st and last one is thematically very similar. So are the 2nd and last one. Scottie believes he is responsible (which he is not) for the 2nd death; so he tried to overcome that guilty feeling. That only brings in the 3rd death – this time he is the responsible person. When the movie credits are being shown camera zooms into an eye of Madeleine. After we (mind it, we – the viewers – the characters of Hitchcock's movie) enter the eye of Madeleine we see spirals of different colors. The credits roll on. And at the end of the credit camera zooms out the eye. But will Scottie be ever able to leave the spiral puzzle within his head? Can he forget Madeleine, her eyes, her blonde hair (another Hitchcockian theme), her dress, her necklace, and the way she used to decorate her hair? May be not. And so do us. If we try to uncover vertigo, the film, we will only push ourselves further into the dark dungeon. We may see a light in front of us. We may start thinking that we have uncovered vertigo. But only till we understand the light is only the beginning of another dungeon. It is the viewers' attachment with the film that makes ""Vertigo"" so fascinating, so captive, so provocative and a true masterpiece. ""Vertigo"" will also be remembered for a unique technique – ""Dolly Zoom"". In this technique ""the camera is pulled away from a subject whilst the lens zooms in, or vice-versa. Thus, during the zoom, there is a continuous perspective distortion, the most directly noticeable feature being that the background appears to change size relative to the subject"" (excerpts from Wikipedia). This technique is also known as ""Vertigo Zoom"" or ""Vertigo Effect"". Many film directors have used this technique since then. It has become quite a cliché now. And don't forget the character of Midge. She is just opposite to what Madeleine is. She is not-so-good looking, single and unfortunately in love with Scottie. She is the 1st step of the ladder which Scottie can easily climb without any problem. But Madeleine is at 3 or 4 steps up the ladder. And as the definition of vertigo goes (""the desire to fall"") Scottie wants Madeleine only. I have a theory that the 2nd part of the film is all within Scottie's head; it is in his dream; it is not real. It is only because the 2nd half starts so abruptly and Midge is surprisingly absent in the 2nd half. Another scene of the movie really captivates me. It is the scene when Scottie and Madeleine go to see the coastal redwoods at Muir Woods National Monument. There is something special about the scene which I cannot explain. Or there may be nothing like that. It is only in my mind! Probably it is the effect of vertigo! Man! I should stop thinking about the film now!!!",
699,7 July 2012,jwin1967,10," Truly, a masterpiece!","I agree with whomever said that this picture is worth watching over and over again. The story was, by and large, a departure from most love stories and other mysteries. Records show that it was not well received at the time of its release, but time changes everything, it seems. Today, Vertigo is highly acclaimed, and worth viewing repeatedly. Jimmy Stewart is at his very best in the starring role, and Kim Novak was perfect as his leading lady. Incidentally, this was the first time I'd seen her in films, when I saw this for the first time in 1988. That was the first of countless times I have seen it. I have the VHS and DVD versions of Vertigo. I agree with the statement that Vertigo has a quality of a filmed dream. Great movie!",

The hero of the detective is training himself to overcome his fear of heights, step by step, then the lovely white soft down, collapsed on the woman.
His classmate Gavin sent him after his wife. The wife's great-grandmother had been abandoned. Was her illness due to genetic predisposition? Or a ghost? Or did she subconsciously play the role of the outcast, saying or doing something, looking at a picture of her great-grandmother and dressing up as that person? The wife had a bad relationship with her husband and felt abandoned.
The character of the detective is very like 007, with deep eyes, but with a certain age. He's driving behind a woman with a flat camera. The silver-white car seems long, perhaps because of the wide screen.
Female trance and ""fifth avenue"" have a ratio.
The woman has been looking into the distance while kissing the detective, the original Riga in the murder of his wife.
The detective who falls in love with ""Gavin's wife"" has a nightmare after his suicide by jumping from the church tower. The background was changing red and green, and he felt like a falling piece of paper. Later, when he was admitted to a mental hospital, the woman who liked him had, in a funny way, changed the picture of the woman into her own face, this time telling the doctor, ""Mozart may not be of any use to him.""
Later he leaves the hospital, in order to find out the truth forced the wife to go to the top of the church tower again, after all the explanation she was surprised by the sudden arrival of the old bell-ringing nun fell from the building.
It is hard to say that the detective fell in love with the ""false wife"".

The Gothic nature of this movie makes it even more scary and challenges your sense of reality from the beginning. If this was a book it would be called 'Wuthering Heights'. If it was real life it would be JFK with all the evidences. This movie demands to be watched over and over again and should be in everyone's video collection.

The climax however does bring the disorder to the forefront of the movie, hence I would consider this a different kind of classic. Its not a usual Hitchcock movie where a movie breathes the theme for the whole 2 hour or so. Also this movie could have been edited a little better by chopping out some of the scenes where both the leads are just looking at each other sitting in the car with same expressions after every 10 minutes of the movie or just following cars etc. It's a world known fact that Hitchcock believed more in pictures than dialogues but in this movie, some scenes felt like a stretch. On the plus side of the movie was James Stewart and his ease with depicting each kind of emotion. In my opinion this was his best performance ever (even better than Rear Window) especially the passion he showed in kiss scenes, at his age are commendable. On the whole an 8 since the quality of a Hitchcock was still maintained its just that it was in different-than-usual areas this time.",

The screenplay is perfect, each image, look, note from the great Bernard Herrmann's soundtrack, color, or any ditail in the screen, is correlated with all the story and gives it a tremendous dimension. There is a fact that, assuming that is a classic movie, reveals that it´s breaking with the way to tell stories of the classic cinema. When the film seems to be over with the fall of Madelaine from the tower, Hitchcock goes further and another film bagins. The point of view changes from Scotty to Judy, and we now that Judy is Madelaine but not Scotty. But all on this final part is related to all in the first, creating an eternal spiral.",

If you read all of the glowing, pretentious reviews of this film before you watch it, then you're likely setting yourself up for disappointment. Orson Welles thought Vertigo was a very bad film.

717,8 August 2003,bigrab65,10, Great in every way,"Some Hitchcock films can be viewed by some as little more than thrillers.  A case in point is Rear Window.  This is not the case for Vertigo, through and through a work of art cinema. What makes this film stand out is how Hitchcock uses all of the film-makers to perfection: acting, storyline, music, editing and so forth. The film's use of lighting is excellent throughout, always echoing in some way the psychological state of the characters.  The graveyard scene, where Hitchcock used fog filters, is one of the best examples of this.  The fog effect gives the viewers a number of different feelings: the obvious is to give a ghostly atmosphere to the scene.  It also gives you the sense of ambiguity about Stewart's actions at this point of the film. The film features arguably the most dramatic ending in the history of cinema.  What we have here is every aspect of film-making coming together, with Stewart acting at perhaps a level of intensity that has rarely been matched before and since.  The film famously ends with Kim Novak dying, however why is this the case? Vertigo is effectively split into two halves, before and after Stewart thinks Novak has died.  What is clear is that these two halves are rather like an image that has been reflected and rotated in some way.  We have Stewart now making over Novak's character.  Stewart making it to the top of the stairs and so forth.  It is this type of role reversal that requires Novak to die.  This of course is hinted at by the rotation of the opening credits by Bass.",

Next, I thought that Scottie was brainwashed by Govin Elster. When Scottie was told things of Madeleine, he saw Judy as Madeleine. Also, he loved Judy as Madeleine. Then I thought that people can't reconsider things if we regard something as particular things once. As a result, Scottie and we thought Madeleine committed suicide. After I finished showing the film, I felt that deceit didn't well. First, Judy change her appearance as Madeleine and loved Judy. As a result, at first, Judy didn't love Scottie as herself, and Scottie loved Judy as Madeleine. Surely, they are poor because they couldn't understand each other and Judy died.

Vertigo requires one buys into the totally unbelievable plot and sub-plots, which is only possible if one possesses no critical faculty whatsoever, thus for the discerning viewer, the only possible judgement on the film is that the whole affair is 'daft', and a waste of time, and unworthy of the generous acclaim heaped on it by the so-called 'learned critics'. In many of his films Hitchcock sneers at his audience, promulgating his personal distaste of the human race, investing his films with misogyny, viciousness, scorn and his own sense of omnipotence in manipulating characters with scant disregard for any valid sense of human feeling. In 'Vertigo', the two main characters are lonely losers, who, unaware of their own failings, who look for redemption where there can be none due to their unredeemed flaws.",
757,4 December 2011,jwardww,8, Rock Hudson Original Scottie,"Yes, it truly would have been an original choice to cast Rock Hudson as Scottie Ferguson. He would have been right for the role in every way: looks, temperament, acting ability. He had already shown a successful romantic side in his Sirk soaps. And he had the brawn and all-American good looks to be believable as a retired San Francisco detective. At 32, he would have been more than believable as the love interest of Kim Novak, then 24. At any age he was a more sensitive actor with a greater range and sensibility than Stewart. Finally, among Hollywood producers, he would have been a plausible choice for the more than decent box office performance of his films. As it is, James Stewart, a non-actor, ruined the film because of his advanced age and for the dreary character he chose to create. He does not succeed in portraying a man poetically obsessed by a feminine ideal. When I first saw this movie I thought it was Kim Novak who stood in the way of Vertigo's becoming a masterpiece. But she actually does an acceptable job of embodying both the classy Madeleine and the baser Judy. Later I found out that even Hitchcock did not object to Novak's replacing Vera Miles, his original Madeleine; and when he had the chance to re-sign Miles after her pregnancy, he stayed with Novak. The only big mistake as far as Novak is concerned is the inclusion of the letter writing scene in which Judy Barton confesses her crime to Scottie and the audience. Hitchcock tried to have the scene deleted as he knew its absence would have made the movie more ambiguous and intriguing until the final half hour. It would have been more exciting to discover Judy's crime along with Scottie as he recognized the necklace from Carlotta's portrait. What's so wrong about Stewart? He was just under 50 in 1957, but he seems more like 70. He's doing his usual hapless bull in a China shop, where someone of greater finesse is called for. The naive persona which was charming in a movie like The Shop Around the Corner had been exaggerated by the time of It's a Wonderful Life and later films into a doddering caricature of Elmer Fudd. It's a bore and never appropriate for a romantic lead. The final scene would have played a thousand times better with Scottie seducing her to the top of the tower, instead of manhandling her as the screenplay called for. The sudden violence is out of character for Scottie, nor does it square with his romantic obsession to turn a woman—even as vulgar as Judy—into his ideal. The way the movie plays now, it's as if Stewart drags her to the belfry to throw her off. Had she gone willingly, then fallen out of her own guilt and fear, it would have seemed to be poetic justice instead of vendetta. Obviously the screenplay was partly to blame. But a lot of that incorrect emotion created by the ending has to do with Stewart's poor acting.",
758,17 October 2005,chiku2se,8, A brilliant movie,An excellent masterpiece by the mystery master Hitchcock's. The first hour and a half will give you a feel of a supernatural thriller. The next half hour unfolds into a murder mystery. This movie once again takes away the viewer by surprise. James Stewart has given a brilliant performance in the role of a private detective who retires from his job because of spells of vertigo. He is offered a job by his close friend to keep an eye on his wife who hasn't been behaving herself lately. After initial hesitation he accepts and in the process fall sin love with her. While following her he believes that a supernatural phenomenon related to her ancestral tragedy as the cause of her bizarre behavior and her tendency to commit suicide. It is Hitchocks style of unfolding the scenes by which he makes the viewer fall into the trick of believing what he wants them to believe. The finale of this movie is amazing. The last 10s of the movie presents something which would be unthinkable by any viewer.,

The swirling opening credits, the hypnotic soundtrack, the dream-like pastel look, the unusual grey tone of wardrobe and back-drops. Is Hitch trying a Douglas Sirk (director of a number of stylistic melodramas of the 1950s) with all this stuff? Then going a little deeper, are we made as obsessed by Madeleine (Kim Novak) by seeing James Stewart's character trailing her on foot and by car for much of the film, with NO suspense or drama? We have to be, or it doesn't work. It didn't for me. (NO SPOILERS) In what might be called the second half there is a moment when we are made aware of something. You'll have to decide if this is shown too soon, as it was for me. Also, why would the husband want to kill a wife that looked liked Kim Novak in the first place?

For anyone who likes Hitchcock but hasn't seen this movie, and for anyone who has even heard about Alfred hitchcock let's get this out of the way, this is hitchcock's masterpiece. Psycho was a great film, and it's right up there  too, but Vertigo wins. I won't go into a lengthly analysis of the film, if you're reading this you've probably read the analysis. This is Alfred Hitchcock at his best, surreal visuals and incredible suspense, even more so than his other great picture, Psycho. The score by Bernard Hermann is possibly the best i have ever heard in a motion picture, adding to the suspense especially in the dream sequence. Unlike some of the people in the reviews before i'm deliberatly trying not to reveal the plot, i saw it the first time, without knowing what the story was, and not realy knowing that much about hitchcock and i was absolutely blown away. I think that's all i really need to say, i think that this is Hitchcock's greatest film and is required viewing for any lovers of suspense along with Psycho, of course, North by Northwest, Strangers on a Train and the 39 steps.

James Stewart plays the gentleman police detective, John Ferguson, who, after a traumatic rooftop chase across San Francisco, realizes he has acrophobia (a fear of heights) which brings on sensations of 'vertigo'. This ailment forces him to retire from the force and regain his health. However, an old college buddy comes out of the woodwork and asks Scottie to use his police know-how to privately investigate the strange habits of his wife, Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak). It transpires that she is haunted by Carlotta Valdes, an apparent figure in her family's past.

James Stewart plays his best role as  Scottie, a detective who is asked by a friend to follow his wife. And what a wife she is: Kim Novak, the prototype Hitchcock blond: cold, mysterious, sensual, beautiful. Vertigo is more of a love story than a thriller, and that's all I can tell you, I suppose, without spoiling anything.

779,13 September 2013,killer24-790-375757,5," Promised so much, delivered so little","Vertigo was a film that was ahead of its time when it was released. Now however, 55 years later, it lacks the lovable endeavour it was once looked upon by. Sure, Alfred Hitchcock does what he does best in this film (and I am in no way disputing his directing talents) and full appreciation must go towards him for the visual effects and the way he uses filming techniques to show Scottie's confusement. Credit must also go to James Stewart as Scottie who seemed to be the only thing worth watching about this film. That, however is I'm afraid all the positives that can be said about this film. The first part of the movie drags with little happening and the rest of the film fails to pick up from there. Sure in 1958 this movie was full of suspense and thought provoking cinema however in this era it just seems dull and lacks the suspense needed to make it enjoyable. The fact this film is called a 'suspense thriller' is almost laughable. The film seems to meander around shots of walking and driving and stalking for a good 40 minutes, something which when the film didn't start that great in the first place doesn't help its cause. The storyline was fairly obvious as well, even for a simpleton like me to guess, in addition to the dull as ditch water dialogue (even at the time) that's teemed with it. The directing as I've mentioned is not to blame and the use of colours and sound are brilliant by Hitchcock but that cannot make up for Vertigo which promised so much and produced so very little on the big screen. I would recommend this film to Hitchcock fans but it is by no means his best film, not even close. The lack of suspense and boring storyline despite the cleverness of Hitchcock means this film has to have 5 stars",

And this is all I have to say: Shadow of a Doubt, Strangers on a Train, Notorious, North by Northwest, The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes, Rebecca, Young and Innocent, Psycho, Saboteur, Sabotage, and a few others warrant more acclaim than this over-long, over-rated, over-done and over-wrought production. It can be rated a seven-starrer and on a night when I'm feeling giddy with generosity, 8. But all in all a sour disappointment. How it managed to grow in acclaim, I am at a loss. The acting was superlative, with Stewart growing from a barely bearable personality (dull and duller) to a thoroughly dislikable fellow who'd been done wrong. Kim Novak was a delightful surprise. I've always liked her and found her to be very sympathetic whenever I've seen her - Middle of the Night, Picnic, - and a much better actress than was generally granted. In this she excelled. Barbara Bel Geddes should have been elevated to greater stardom and Tom Helmore was perfect as the heel. The photography was good, colorful, with interesting collage-like minutes of sailing/falling through air. The music was non-stop (unusual in movies) - there was never a moment when some notes were not being heard and they heightened the intensity. But...But: 2 hours and 8 minutes! No movie should be 2 hours and 8 minutes. It's like reading a fat book that can't help but repeat itself. I did like it though and would REALLY have liked it had it shaved off at least 20 minutes in the middle. But Shadow of a Doubt? Now, THAT'S movie magic. And that's my 2 cents!",

The film eventually becomes a tragic drama with totally fateful events.

Another typical Hitch story, with colorful and iconic special effects in the style of Robert Burks, which is breathtaking for the 50s. In addition to the special effects, the production design of the film stands out, the soundtrack is memorable , fascinating and emotional, in short they are masterpieces.

Like while he's first investigating Madeleine his fear is barely mentioned or shown until like the first church scene. Sort of seemed like the main gimmick of the film took a back seat for like 3/5 of the runtime. The performances are great, the cinematography is creative, and the story is engaging.

The wonderful icing on the proverbial cake is, of course, the beautiful, touching, and haunting music by Bernard Herrmann. This melancholy soundtrack brings my favorite movie to completion. I only have two small wishes about this film to make it better in my eyes, that the shot which pans up to show the outside of the court room hearing was better done and that the shot of the pillow hitting the ground when Scottie asks Madeleine to sit by the fire was repeated when Scottie does the same thing with Judy.

812,11 March 2006,ichthus-4,10," Old-fashioned detective drama, beautifully executed","Beautiful is the word for this film because of the love that the camera lens has for its subject (like colour postcards of San Francisco from the 1950s), and for the haunting, melancholy score that Bernard Hermann composed. A sense of loss pervades this film, far beyond the loss experienced on multiple levels by the main character; there is a sense of the loss of a civilization, too. The methodical driving scenes around the city streets, the intent viewing in an art gallery, the appreciation for California history--these reaffirm emotionally for the viewer what the intellect already knew: The world of 'Vertigo' no longer exists. Nor does the Hollywood that gave us 'Vertigo' exist. Gently-paced, subtle storytelling has little appeal to the Ritalin generation with its incessant demand for action; the job of the filmmaker changed, somewhere along the way, from ""telling a story"" to ""providing an alternate reality."" But this was Hitchcock the storyteller at his finest, and his attempts at special effects, although commendable for their time, might distract those whose souls have been addicted to eye candy. In other words, if you're under 50, you just may not get it. The one disappointment I had with this film was the performance of Kim Novak; admittedly, trying to fill the shoes of Grace Kelly set an impossible standard for her to live up to. Supporting actress Barbara Bel Geddes, on the other hand, captured the frustration of being No. 3 in ""three's a crowd"" perfectly.",

The suspense of the film leading up to that shocking ending keeps you interested right up until, well, it happens. Something that really caught my eye was the opening credit sequence.

822,7 June 2022,mohabbatiartin,10, Hitchcock's Vertigo,"Vertigo is film from from 1958, directed by the great Alfred Hitchcock, starring Jamie Stewart as Detective Scottie and Kim Novak, who acted two characters absolutely fantastic, as Madeline and Judy. Vertigo has one of the best, maybe even the best movie openings of all time. It starts with a close up on Kim Novak's down half of the face. The camera slowly moves towards the eyes. Then the camera zooms in the left eye of Novak and inside the eye they are colored spirals circling. The zoom goes into the eye, where you can see the spirals circling on a black Background. If you watch extreme closely you can feel the Vertigo, which mean dizziness. It remins me a bit of the stargage sequence in 2001: a space odyssey. The different colors, the movement of the spirals and the approach of the spirals, draw you into the picture. This whole sequence is followed by Bernard Herman's prelude which has a melody of terzes repeating again, like a spiral. It is not Herman's best score, but one of his good one. The scene gives the music a feeling, not the music the scene, like in Schindler's list, ""Also sprach Zarathustra"" in 2001 or some scenes in Psycho. It means if you haven't seen the movie, you wouldn't have a connection with the music. The Scene gave the music the meaning. After the spiral scene there is a zoom out and you see Novak's left eye. Then there is a cut to the next scene, where we see three people climbing up a ladder to the rooftop. In the front there is a thief, who wears interestingly white clothes. Behind him we see a police, than James Stewart who is a Detective. While jumping from a building to another one, Detective Scottie couldn't jump and he hold with his hand the gutter, so that he couldn't fall down. When the policeman see him, he want to help Scottie, but he couldn't and he fall off the roof. There is a scene where scottie is looking down and too feel the Vertigo, there is a zoom out, where you can feel the Vertigo and it's a great technique which is used in many films and animations later. When the policeman falls off, there is a a shot, were you see him falling down and land between the two buildings on the center of the picture. The downfall is made very well and has aged very well and hasn't got funny like the helicopter scene in Rear Window or the attacking scenes in ""the birds"". These are the only bad things about his movie, that some scenes get old and are now kinda funny, which is hardly seen in Vertigo or not seen in Psycho. These whole scene I described is in my opinion the greatest scene in Vertigo. The intro with all the colored spirals and the rooftop scene with the great tension. After the intro there is a great cut that takes us to the house of Midge (Scottie's girlfriend). John Scottie Ferguson is suffering from dizziness and because of that he couldn't continue his work, because of the Phobia. Then One of his old friends calls him to shadow his wife, because she behaves differently and also has suicidal tendencies. After that there is a scene where scottie's friend gavin and her wife madeline are sitting in a restaurant. James Stewart is sitting at the bar. Then Gavin and her wife stand up to walk towards the door. There is a shot where Madeline is standing in front of Scottie. This is a great and beautiful shot that shows os that scottie fell in love with Madeline. The falling in love is portrayed in the most beautiful way. Scottie agree to pursue Madeline and tails her by car. He see Madeline buying a flower and going to a museum with it. She sits in front of a picture of Carlota Valdes. We later learn that she is her grandmother. In the picture of carlotta you can see a flower that madeline is holding in her hand, she and carlotta valdes have the same necklace, and most importantly, carlotta and novak's hair is tied up in the same shape at the back, which is spiral-like. That is the first symbol of vertigo. Hitchcock showed everything in a shot that is perfect. In the movie there are many signs of Vertigo, for example where scottie and madeline are walking in the woods and there is a tablet of an outline of a tree that has the shape of Vertigo. Vertigo is about obsession. Obsession with Madeline's past. Scottie's obsession with his past after the church tower incident, where Madeline is seen falling from the tower. The obsession of Judy to make Madeline. Not only is the film about Vertigo, but the film is a Vertigo. At the end you see how Judy sees the the figure of a nun and then jumps down from the tower. The same thing happened again. It is a Vertigo. Vertigo is also the term for direction. The color palettes, or the shots where madeline jumps into the water or where she and scottie kiss in front of the ozan. The best shot is where Judy opens the door in the hotel and looks just like Madeline, and the green lettering of the hotel name behind the curtain lights her up as if she has come from one world to another. And the tension has not aged. Vertigo is in my opinion the best film of Alfred Hitchcock as a director and of his Alfred Hitchcock being. Vertigo is a dream. Nothing but a dream. And it is pure art.",

Hitchcock's cinematography is beautiful as always, the camera is almost a character itself. The story is suspenseful and well written. The use of colour is vibrant and well thought out, the score is great, the special effects mostly hold up to a degree, all the performances are perfects, i especially liked all the little nuances and expressions in James Stewart's performance, the highlight of the film.",
824,19 April 2021,mxddiie07,8, Heights were never my thing!,"Alfred Hitchcock has done it again. I find his movies to be very unique and attention-grabbing. His ideas and techniques are thrilling! The score of the film was beautifully put together and suited the visuals of the film. Hitchcock made sure that the use of color in this film took the lead. His ability to truly let colors set the mood is admirable. Each character was developed in a way that feels different than how characters are typically formed. I would highly suggest viewers to pay attention to colors that are consistently on the screen. Never trusting what you see or think definitely plays a role in this film. Our main characters, Scott and Madeleine, appeal as more than the people we see. They become the colors we see. It is a very easy film to get lost in your head with. It takes some thinking and putting pieces together, but with every re-watch you gain more information about the not one, but TWO twists at the end. Hitchcock almost never disappoints!",
825,14 April 2021,AlexCWM,10, Immaculate in Every Way,"Vertigo is a movie that really surprised me. Hitchcock does a fantastic job making the main character feel realistically insane. Throughout the film, we watch as a job turns to adoration and then to obsession, and it is genuinely spine tingling. The fantastic story is backed up by excellent camera work and cast. The actors are made for their roles, and their chemistry is visible in every line. The color and camera work in this film make it feel at the same time old and modern.

We can see fragments of its influence in classic movies from ""Chinatown"" to ""The Sixth Sense"". The control theme is really well-done in the unique story. The final was also very cleverly executed. The only real problem I had with the film was that the story didn't really push itself at times and that made the flow become bare in some scenes.

To be honest, I expected this film was kind of horror at the opening, because the screen was so dark, and the sound was terrible. However, in fact, this film shows much deeper thing! I think one of major theme of this film is feminism. I was so surprised to have put a foreshadowing of phallus: stick and the Coit tower. Also Scottie made Judy like Madeline. This description shows power or freedom of men. I intend that ""Vertigo"" has accelerated feminism movement later. Then still now, we should have a think about states of women with comparison to men. Actually, I couldn't bring myself to this movie. Because the climax rapidly developed and I couldn't understand this film perfectly. Certainly Judy cheated Scottie and she committed serious crime, but she regretted her sin and she looked to be self -examination. So I was so shocked at the end.",
831,5 August 2014,justin-ward79,8, Great characters occupy this excellent thriller,"Upon browsing through critic and user reviews containing varying degrees of appreciation for this film I have decided to share my own thoughts on the so called masterpiece. The two things I have concluded about it are that: (1) No, I believe it is not a flawless piece of cinematic intrigue, but that (2) the movie, regardless of some negative reviews, does have some great characters that work serve the material very well. Now, I say that the film is no masterpiece because of the way the story unfolds. Like many other people who responded negatively to watching this film, I found the it lacking in any suspense and/or tension whatsoever in some parts (and all parts after the letter writing scene) and that seriously dulls down the movie to some extent. Where some may go on to deride the characters and acting, however, my problems cease with the previously stated story issues and a few illogical hiccups (Ferguson's silence and the perfect doppelgänger to name a couple). I believe that the characters are very well done and the fact that you get to view both leads and see their sides as the mystery unfolds really does balance well against the lack of suspense. It was actually quite entertaining with this mystery that continued to keep me guessing for the first half of the story. I especially enjoyed James Stewart performance as Ferguson and how we start off being thrown in right as his life begins to go downhill and how we continue to watch that turmoil develop. I think it is a very interesting direction to send the character that works even if it probably shouldn't considering it doesn't start with him at a better point in his life first in order to show how far he's fallen. Honestly if the scene where Novak's character was writing that damn letter had appeared later in the film I may have even agreed with calling it a masterpiece.",
832,26 April 2021,mmcintyre813,8, VERTIGO!!,I think this movie was a really interesting one. Personally I think this is a movie I wouldn't watch again.

I started off feeling bad for Scottie, but towards the end of the film I really didn't like him. I understand he went insane, but Hitchcock definitely made it hard to like him. I absolutely hated how he treated Madeleine when he found her. Madeleine just wanted to him to love her and was willing to change the way she looked and acted for him. Kim Novak had a hard role to play in this film, acting as two characters that look similar, but are very different. I think she did a fantastic job. Another thing I noticed was that although it was in Technicolor, the colors seemed extremely bright. Was this done on purpose or accident? Overall, I really enjoyed watching this movie, Hitchcock never disappoints!",

I loved the psychedelic , sprilling effects to show the main characters descent into madness. This effect was reflected in the camera angle going up the spirally church stairway as well.. Not very complicated as far as special effects go, yet had a lot of punch. The story line was amazing and believable , with the history of Madeline's grandmother, and the old fashioned oil painting of Carlotta with the antique necklace, that proves to be Madeline undoing was genius.",

Um dos melhores filmes já feitos sobre a exploração do ser humano e das suas falhas tanto no lado que tenta fazer o bem como aquele que está pelas piores intenções.

844,11 April 2018,Seraphima12,7, Allure of Mystery and Obsession with Looks,"For me, this is not a typical Hitchcock movie. Though there are mystery and crime elements and also some thrilling moments, the film is more about 'believing what you made to believe to see'. And this makes it more of a psychological drama. Hitchcock cleverly shows us how mystery can lure us in and get hooked. What is more how unsolved mystery can become an obsession driving a man crazy.
Scottie, a retired detective with fear of heights, gets 'hooked' on a mystery of an attractive, seductive and alluring woman. He is lead to believe that she is 'possessed' by the spirit of her great grandmother who committed a suicide. Despite being a detective albeit a retired one, Scottie remains somewhat weak character due to his original flaw - fear of heights which is used by Gavin to manipulate him - and his fascination with the mystery of the woman he cannot comprehend. His non-comprehension of the subject deepens when he tries to recreate Madeleine's look forcing Judy to alter her hair colour and style and forcing her to wear style of clothes that Madeleine used to wear. Scottie is not interested in the real woman - Judy - behind the mask of Madeleine, he is obsessed with the looks of the woman that lured him into the mystery in the first place, trying to recreate exhilaration and attraction he felt. Gavin used Judy to impersonate his wife whom he murdered and Scotties uses Judy to impersonate the impersonated Madelaine. Both men do not care for the real woman. For them she is just a tool. Quite a reflection fo the Hollywood world back then and I believe even now.",

This quote from Madeleine sure means more than just saying I don't want to die but it also means how we all feel when our loved ones left us which is a part of life. Hitchcock sure did a great job directing Vertigo which is now one of the movies that would live on forever in the history of cinema. The film is based on a book written Hitchcock's two favorite writers, the film takes on a psychological problem around the scores of real people. The protagonist is an Police detective named John ""Scottie"" Ferguson who is asked by an old college friend, Gavin Elster, if he would have a look into his wife Madeleine's odd behavior. Gavin is starting to believe that her odd behavior is the reincarnation of a woman who died many years ago and is concerned about her sanity. Scottie follows her and rescues her from an apparent suicide attempt when she jumps into San Francisco bay. He gets to know her and soon falls in love with her. They go to an old mission church and he is unable to stop her from climbing to the top of the steeple where she jumps to her death. Several months later, he meets Judy Barton, a woman who is the spitting image of Madeleine. He tries to recreate that women into Madeleine image by getting her to dye her hair and wear the same type of clothes. He soon begins to realize he has been duped, and was a pawn in a complex piece of theater that was meant to end in tragedy. The story told through this film was incredible, even though it felt a bit slow at some parts. However, that is exactly the case here. But I can see that Hitchcock drags us on to a long journey, because there is a reason it does that and the conclusion is more than satisfying. I loved my experience watching ""Vertigo"", it just felt like it took a bit too long to get to the point. From the screenplay to the acting, the overall atmosphere of this film screams brilliance. The film's ironic plot twist is the important factor that made this film amazing. Unlike a few of Hitchcock's previous films, Vertigo takes a decidedly mature look at murder. This film has a long history as well as a legacy unlike many of his other films. I think that ""Psycho"" would be the only true rival to this film, though this one feels more like a passion project than the former. It's not the type of film to watch over and over again. But it is surely a film that can be recommended over and over again to those who have not yet seen it. It is not at the top of Hitchcock's masterpieces, but it tries very hard to get there.

""Vertigo"" is surreal at times, and I loved it for that!",
852,4 July 2020,nmjoe,6, Typical Hitchcock,"Incredible film angles, breathtaking lighting, and shots that would make for an award winning photograph. But also, as was the case with most Alfred Hitchcock films, this is the story of an old man creeping on a much younger woman. No means no, even if you are Jimmy Stewart.

855,9 March 2020,noahmarconi,10, Unforgettable,"The movie is incredible, but being a composer, I want share how the music contributes to the drama. If I had to name the best Bernard Herrmann score, it would be very easy to argue for Vertigo. On display here is an utterly complete exercise in dramatic storytelling. The handling of tension in harmony and melody is second, if not equal to, Wagner himself. The love theme is one of the greatest creations of sound I have ever heard. Very interestingly, throughout the first half of the film, Herrmann establishes another melody to represent Madeleine - it can very easily be thought of as the love theme in the first half. However, once things turn dark and James Stewart's love obsession begins, this theme morphs into the famous, appoggiatura infested gut-wrencher of a theme. Vertigo is a film about obsession, and to represent this in the score, Herrmann continuously, again and again, returns to the melody in an agonizing way. It is not fully resolved until the end of the love scene, just like the Tristan chord (Wagner's opera ""Tristan und Isolde"") 93 years earlier. Herrmann new exactly what he was doing and who he was borrowing from.",

858,28 June 2014,www-zaid93,8, awesome suspense till the end,"Dismissed when first released, later heralded as one of director Alfred Hitchcock's finest films (and, according to Hitchcock, his most personal one), this adaptation of the French novel D'entre les morts weaves an intricate web of obsession and deceit. It opens as Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart) realizes he has vertigo, a condition resulting in a fear of heights, when a police officer is killed trying to rescue him from falling off a building. Scottie then retires from his position as a private investigator, only to be lured into another case by his old college friend, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore). Elster's wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak), has been possessed by a spirit, and Elster wants Scottie to follow her. He hesitantly agrees, and thus begins the film's wordless montage as Scottie follows the beautiful yet enigmatic Madeleine through 1950s San Francisco (accompanied by Bernard Herrmann's hypnotic score). After saving her from suicide, Scottie begins to fall in love with her, and she appears to feel the same way. Here tragedy strikes, and each twist in the movie's second half changes our preconceptions about the characters and events. In 1996 a new print of Vertigo was released, restoring the original grandeur of the colors and the San Francisco backdrop, as well as digitally enhancing the soundtrack",
859,23 February 2004,maxogre,7, overrated,"Hitchcock is, and has always been, one of the greatest directors of all time.  As a matter of fact, he's my absolute favorite.  I watched Vertigo with admittedly high expectations, and was more than a bit disappointed with what I found.  I admit Jimmy Stewart gave a fine performance, and so did the other actors, but none of them gave a great performance. Most of the plot is rather confusing and coupled with the ending makes even less sense.  I just couldn't believe anything in the movie could actually ever happen, and so it was missing that touch of realism that most Hitchcock movies have. Hitchcock did a fine job directing and Jimmy Stewart did a fine job in his role, but the plot was silly and there was plenty of padding as well (I hope you like scenes of people driving).  Hitchcock and Stewart made this mediocre movie into a good movie, but it is definitely not a great movie.",
860,2 March 2016,veramkaufmann,8, Beautiful movie with flawed choice of lead,"This is a film that bears repeated viewings. The idea of questionable identity is used to explore love and the way love feeds itself on difficulties and distance and is destroyed by availability and banality. Jimmy Stewart stars playing against type as an apparently easy- going man who becomes obsessed with Kim Novak's elegant woman obsessed with a tragic past. The film provides a character study that focuses on his attempt to reassert himself as a man after a humiliating failure at work due to an attack of vertigo, and the infantile aspects of his character particularly in relating to women.",

862,13 July 2021,marydanza,8, Too Slow...,"""Vertigo"" is certainly aesthetically pleasing but it can't be said the same about the length. It is irrefutably too long and too slow. The whole story develops after more than half movie and the director doesn't seem to give us any kind of hint. The plot twist hits the viewer but not as much as he deserves since he had slept for an hour (if not more). This film is not a typical a thriller but deals with some interesting topics such as love, trauma and the split personality. The last one touches in particular the protagonists.",

872,21 August 2019,sebastianamaral,10, Hitchcock's Best Film.,Vertigo is an all-time classic. There is nothing else that needs to be said.,
873,24 August 2014,stefan-nesic1,6, Falling Short,"Alfred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' stands out in the director's canon. It lacks the emotional resonance of ""Shadow of a Doubt,' the excitement of 'Strangers on a Train,' the fun of 'North by Northwest,' and the thrills of 'Psycho.'In essence, it is slow-moving and occasionally dull. James Stewart, who has a sort of vulnerability in his facial expressions - a childlike innocence, is perfectly cast as a mentally unstable man whose life is overtaken by his obsession with a dead lover. Near the second half of the film, his eyes speak louder than actions or words. However, there is a lack of chemistry between him and the lovely Kim Novak, who plays a Marilyn Monroe-like character with more charm than Monroe could ever pull off. It's as if the actors realize how silly the plot really is. The romantic interest which holds the film together is quite dull. It is nearly impossible to believe in the love that exists between Judy (Novak) and John (Stewart). Further, the acrophobia of John is interesting and exemplifies a theme of vulnerability. John is crippled by past trauma, and the signature dolly zoom sure shows it. Even Hermann's score, sounds like an object falling slowly with a decrescendo near the end sparked by dramatic riff. A film so heavily reliant on emotion and love could have provided the audience with some catharsis. 'Vertigo' has great performances, kinetic camera work, a disturbing score; all these pieces ultimately fail to connect.",

876,27 April 2019,jn-39943,4, Good -but one of his BEST - on the edge about that!,"Don't get me wrong. Alfred Hitchcock like Rod Serling were definitely ahead of their time in many ways.
One reason I don't like Vertigo is strictly personal - I understand Hitchcock's obsession with Grace Kelly and when she was no longer available he picked each actress and dressed them as he had Miss Kelly(much like the character Scottie does to Judy) but why Kim Novak who is as stiff and cold as her bleached white hair?
But my main reason is because Hitchcock the master of suspense takes it away TOO SOON!
There's NO REASON for him to reveal the truth about Judy right after they met. That could have been kept a secret until they return to the church -she could confess to him and he could say he'd figured it out and that was why he brought her there!
Whenever they get to that part of the movie I turn it off because it's over as far as I'm concerned.
I don't know why people rank it so highly compared to Dial M for Murder or Psycho or Rear Window metal?",

Unfortunately, the movie is way too slow. Some scenes in the beginning are very boring because of the poor dialogs. The acting didn't helped with that, in most of the scenes it seemed artificial. The soundtrack seems to be delayed in some scenes, killing the whole thriller. However, the plot is very interesting and the last 30 minutes makes this big waste of time into a worth it movie. The first 100 minutes I couldn't give more than a 4, but the ending is so well constructed with such a good soundtrack that I am giving it a 6 in general.",

882,5 January 2007,awall16,9, Truly Great...Almost Brilliant,"Whenever I watch this movie, I get to thinking that Hitchcock made a fantastic, wonderful film, but was just shy of breaking through into true brilliance. He was so close here to doing what he never actually ventured to do: create his own reality with film. Hitchcock is probably the greatest of the directors whose films always existed within what, for lack of a truly good term, we may call 'familiar reality' or 'objective reality'. With Vertigo, if he had done just a few things differently, it could have transcended this - he could have made a film that challenged our notions of reality, instead of abiding by its laws. He could have made his only truly 'surreal' film; as it is, its just a romance woven around a complex scam. I shouldn't say 'just'; after all, this is one of the greatest films of its era. There's no denying that Hitchcock was a genius of film-making (and I don't use the term 'genius' loosely); but with this film, he was just a step away from being one of cinema's greatest visionaries as well.",
883,18 September 2013,ZoeHewitson,5, Overall I enjoyed the film more than I expected,"Overall I enjoyed the film more than I expected-as I'm not the biggest fan of old movies- But not a great deal. I was rather confused throughout most the film. I did however like the story near more the beginning; the mystery around the whole madeleine character was rather intriguing, especially when the hotel housekeeper said she had not visited her room. I also liked how the audience saw the story threw Scotties eyes, not knowing about Judy until the flashback revealing everything. However I lost interest greatly when the flashback was shown as it answered the mystery of what was happening/happened to Madeleine (personally I would have kept the flashback till Scotty takes Judy to the tower) I think the Characters are a little boring, it took me a while to because interested and invested in the character, it did weird me out a bit when Scottie went a bit phyco and abusive towards Judy as he didn't seem to be that type of character up to that point. For the time it was made in I think the production values are very good, the only thing I thought was bad was whenever someone fell, it looked so bad but I could cope with it. I don't really think I would personally recommend it to my friends as it's not really a film they would be interested in. Nor do I think it's a film that really sticks out as memorable. For me personally I would not rate this in my top list of films. I would not class it in the worst films I've ever seen. It would probably be somewhere in the lower middle quarter. My main issue was it took too long to get into the main story line. I also don't understand why the nun scarred Judy so much, that was actually a little unrealistic. Although then again when I watched this alone I did get scared, but I mean if someone else was there I would not go slip off a building.",
