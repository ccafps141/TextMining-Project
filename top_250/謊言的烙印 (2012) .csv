0,30 January 2014,Hitchcoc,8, Once Again: The Children's Hour,"Having worked as a teacher for some forty years, I knew deep down inside that a vindictive lie from one student (out of thousands that I had) could take me down in a minute. People are so protective of their children (as they should be) that sometimes they fail to see that they are children with an underdeveloped moral code and a tendency toward impulsiveness and peer pressure. They are sometimes motivated by their own interests and by temper. Unfortunately, parents tend to give them credence when they tell outlandish things. I even felt that tug with my own children, but learned to investigate the story before reacting. Often a simple comment meant a teacher ""hated"" them, or some series events was made to seem much more than it was. Of course, I believe we must be very careful to keep our children's trust and support them when necessary. The people in this movie don't do this and send a man to hell and back. A dear friend of mine spent six months in jail, accused by his daughter of molestation. She finally admitted that she got made because he wouldn't allow her to go out on a school night with her boyfriend. This movie is gut wrenching and real and it happens all the time. Maybe we need to learn patience and to that end, it works very well.",/

2,18 January 2014,planktonrules,9, The scary thing is that this could happen to almost anyone...,"One of my favorite foreign language films it Thomas Vinterberg's ""The Celebration"" (""Festen""). It's an absorbing tale about sexual abuse--abuse that comes out during a birthday party for a beloved family patriarch. Now, with ""The Hunt"" (""Jagten""), Vinterberg directs a film where quite the opposite happens--a man is accused of sexual abuse but who is 100% innocent. Had the director always done films denying sexual abuse, folks might have thought him strange but here the brave director allows himself to go in a completely different direction with his movie.",e
3,14 November 2017,classicsoncall,9," ""He hasn't done anything. I just said something stupid.""","Stories like this are frightening, especially when it turns out that the accused child abuser is innocent and winds up with his life utterly destroyed. This one turns out to be a classic case of someone being guilty until proved innocent, and by then, the damage has already been done. And in today's world, the type of scenario presented in the film treads on a slippery slope. After young Klara makes her thoughtless statement to the teacher Grethe (Susse Wold), one can't find fault in the actions taken by her and other persons in a position of authority.",v
4,3 October 2012,larry-411,10," Emotionally draining but truly moving ""ripped from the headlines"" story","""The Hunt"" is the latest unflinching drama from Danish auteur Thomas Vinterberg. Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, this is an ambitious star vehicle for legendary actor Mads Mikkelsen, an icon in Denmark and familiar face around the world as well. He plays Lucas, a small-town kindergarten teacher. At its heart the story is ultimately a powerful comment on prejudice, based on true incidents, that may leave you emotionally drained but truly moved.",i
5,5 December 2012,TheSquiss,10, A film for those who stupidly believe there's no smoke without fire.,"Sometimes children lie.  Sometimes good people give in to hysteria, and lose all sense of  reason.  Sometimes they destroy innocent lives.  The Hunt (aka Jagten) is the latest offering from Denmark that will  knock you sideways. Forget the thrill of TV dramas The Killing, Borgen  and The Bridge, Thomas Vinterberg's film is a shocking, harrowing  experience that will affect you profoundly and will live in your mind  for a very long time. The Hunt is for those who don't need to 'enjoy' a  film to regard it as valid and who are not afraid to step into the  darkness of the injustice and judgment of which we are all capable.  More than that, it is a film for those who stupidly believe there is no  smoke without fire.  Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a lonely teacher, divorced from his wife,  kept apart from his son and devoted to the young children in his care  at the nursery and within the community. He is a genuinely good man who  has earned the respect of his peers, the love of a new girlfriend and  the trust of the children who leap out of hedges to wrestle him and be  chased around the playground by him.  Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), the daughter of his best friend, Theo  (Thomas Bo Larsen) has an innocent, childish crush on Lucas when two  situations occur in quick succession. Firstly she is exposed to an  explicit pornographic image and, secondly, Lucas gently chastises her  for inappropriate behavior towards him. With a fertile imagination,  childish indignation and no comprehension of the consequences, Klara  makes an accusation against Lucas and his world implodes.  For only the fifth time so far this year, I believe I have witnessed a  near-perfect film. The Hunt is complete due to the tight screenplay,  the sensitivity of Vinterberg's direction and the performances from  principal and peripheral actors alike that are always absorbing and  frequently astounding.  Mikkelsen must certainly be the focal point of any review. His  performance as Lucas causes the stomach to tighten and the back tingle  as we wonder How would I react? In much the same way that Colin Firth's  George crumpled when receiving the news of his partner's death in A  Single Man, so Mikkelsen's Lucas is silently crushed as he is told that  accusations have been made. Lucas suffers the physical and emotional  wounds of slander and revenge for an act he cannot conceive and of  which he has less knowledge than those who condemn and attack him.  Equally, both Larsen and Anne Louise Hassing as Klara's parents  carefully unwrap the turmoil any parent would suffer upon hearing their  young child has suffered sexual abuse. It is a challenge not to yell at  the screen ""Don't be so stupid,"" or to scream expletives at Grethe  (Susse Wold) the head teacher who loses her grip on both duty and  reason and germinates the hatred and judgment that follow. As Lucas'  son, Marcus, Lasse Fogelstrøm gives a heartfelt performance segueing  seamlessly from courage to hurt to desperation and anger and his  distress is a warning to those given over to rumours.  The surprise, no, the absolute shock, with the casting is Wedderkopp.  In an adult with twenty years experience on the big screen it would be  a breathtaking performance; that this is the debut of a young child is  staggering. She is entirely believable as the girl with the vivid  imagination and understandable lack of foresight who is lead by  over-enthusiastic adults and suffers her own punishment of confusion  alone.  The tragedy within The Hunt is explicit and unavoidable. The external  tragedy is that it will probably not feature on most To See lists  because it is both foreign and that the explosions are emotional rather  than physical. Although it is Denmark's entry for Best Film in a  Foreign Language for the Oscars, I suspect both Mikkelsen and Vinterbeg  will be completely overlooked in their own right as with the principals  of Beasts of the Southern Wild. Thank goodness for the BAFTAS and Mark  Kermode! The events depicted in The Hunt are utterly horrific. Don't  sit in front of the screen expecting a light, easy, thought provoking  flick. I emerged numb, angry, helpless and terrified. But for one  careless or cruel comment, it could happen to me.  Or you.",e
6,21 May 2015,Quinoa1984,10, excellent drama that is tough to watch,"The thing about Thomas Vinterberg's The Hunt that you should know is that there's no ""twist"" or big revelation. There's no real ambiguity about whether or not Lucas touched or 'showed' himself to little Klara, the daughter of Lucas' best friend. If there were, this might be a very different movie - perhaps even one that leaned on being dishonest with the audience about the 'did he or didn't he' intentions. It's clear enough early on that Klara isn't telling the whole truth when she mentions to one of the other Kindergarten workers about the ""rod"" that stands up (meaning the penis), but it doesn't mean she's exactly lying either, just confused in that way that little kids who don't know anything about sex might be if, say, shown a very brief image of a ""rod"". So there's that. But what The Hunt is really about is perception and how quickly people can turn on someone with a target on them - guilt or no guilt, but especially in the case of not guilty - like with Lucas.",w
7,24 November 2013,kosmasp,9, Rumor Mill,"This is a really tough movie to watch. I don't know how they do it, but keeping it ""real"" is not an issue with Mr. Vinterberg and others as it seems. Having a real situation that will throw you and others off balance and play it as straight as possible sounds simple, but it really isn't. You need actors like Mads Mikkelsen to convey the story and be able to portray all the facets of his character.",/

In Jagten, a group of friends and neighbours turn hostile when one of them is falsely accused of sexually abusing a young child, the daughter of his best friend. ",8
11,1 January 2013,RainDogJr,10, It hurts...,"This is the most powerful drama I had the fortune to experience this past year. It's up there with Michael Haneke's AMOUR, but this definitely made me *feel* more. When, near the ending of THE HUNT, we have some hope for the protagonist, a kindergarten teacher who has been unjustly accused of child molestation, I actually thought something like ""I hope the movie ends right now!""

12,9 June 2014,SnoopyStyle,8, Mads makes this better,Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a much liked person in the community. He is getting divorced while having limited time with teenage son Marcus. He's working at the kindergarten after his school closed down. Little Klara is the daughter of his best friend Theo and she really likes him. She tries to give him a present which Lucas tries to gently turn back. She tells a fib to head teacher Grethe that explodes out of control.,4
13,28 December 2018,takenistaken,9," Made me very angry, enough to let out a few tears","This was very powerful. I was very angry throughout the whole movie, how no one gives the accusation even a bit of doubt had me swearing at every single character. Everyone has acted very foolishly towards an maddeningly innocent man, and while it is very foolish... it is also very realistic, I can definitely see it happen in real life. The church scene and the visit by the main character's best friend once he realized how wrong he was made me shed a few tears.
And then I was back to being angry again, seeing how everything is seemingly back to normal, all is forgiven, all too easily. I do not think I would be able to forgive in his place, nor would I be able to go hunting in the woods with those same blind hating people carrying rifles. I know it's been a year since - but I feel like a few scenes were missed to show what happened before everyone was acting as if nothing had happened.
And well, while this movie had me angry and hurting, it was also a very well told story, very well acted.... that carries a very important message.",6
14,6 March 2013,WilliamCKH,10, Harrowing Film!,"Whenever I watch a great film, I always have a sense of feeling cleansed, as if a soiled part of me has been washed away (for the time being anyway) by something on the screen that touches a better part of my soul. THE HUNT certainly did that for me. The story is a simple one, a man, a teacher, is wrongly accused of sexually misconduct with a young child and his community, filled with old friends and acquaintances, turn on him and make his life a living hell.",4
15,24 October 2012,howard.schumann,9, A shocking picture of injustice and paranoia,"According to English Professor Jack Lynch, ""Lies, once they are accepted as true, take on a life of their own, one that lasts long after the original falsehoods have been exposed."" The power of the continued acceptance of lies is reflected in Thomas Vinterberg's The Hunt, the disturbing story of the false accusation of a kindergarten teacher of sexual abuse. It is an accusation that reveals the sordid underbelly of a small town, hidden beneath the veneer of middle-class civility. Written by Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm, The Hunt is a thought-provoking drama that makes us aware both of the vigilance needed to protect our children from predators, and of the crucial importance of following the precept that an individual is innocent until proved guilty in a court of law.",5
16,3 September 2013,fonofanatical,9, Finding His Way In The Forest,"Here in the small town where I reside, our local newspaper had a recent headline that a beloved teacher was suspected of improper contact with a student. The article was complete along with his picture and I felt that this teacher's life was over as he knew it whether the information was accurate or false. I felt that I would withhold judgement pending an accurate and a detailed investigation, but I know that others would not give the teacher this courtesy. Human nature is an interesting thing to observe and we often get trapped in our own snares with comments such as ""I really can't tolerate judgemental people"".",6
17,2 July 2021,Leofwine_draca,8, Realism is key,"A slow-burning and intense Danish drama featuring a typically electrifying turn from Mads Mikkelsen as an intensely sympathetic nursery worker falsely accused of a crime he didn't commit. Shades of Hitchcock's 'wronged man' genre here, except this is much more of a realistic character study rather than twisty, action-fuelled thriller. The acting, writing and direction are all on form, and despite the harrowing subject matter this is an engrossing drama in which the realism is key above everything else.",/

19,17 October 2012,lilibartley,10, Fantastic and compelling,"I went to see this as part of the London Film Festival on Monday. I have to say that two days later it still resonates in my mind. Yes, it's a common tale that has been told in cinema before(man is wrongly accused and ostracised), but never so well, in my eyes. The acting is first class with no exception and the cinematography is perfect, creating a tense mood throughout the film. It's not for the faint hearted, but I think it's an important subject matter and very current. I've often wondered what it must be like for someone wrongly accused of such a crime and the hysteria that surrounds it. I have read reviews that say this is unrealistic but I don't agree, I only have to look on my own front doorstep in England to see exactly the same sort of behaviour, often far far more intense.",r
20,12 October 2012,Teaber71,9," Excellent, moving film","I saw this movie yesterday. I agree with previous reviewers, this is an excellent, moving, wonderfully acted movie. It is impossible I think to go through it without being brought to tears at one point or another. You also feel like screaming at some characters sometimes - ""what are you doing? Open your eyes! Listen!"" But the great thing is you always understand where each character is coming from- you might not agree with their actions, but nothing they do feels forced or unrealistic. Mikkelsen is amazing in this. I had seen him in a few movies before, and always thought highly of him, but here he is just incredible. It's a tough subject matter, and the movie does not shy away from it, but at the same time it is not vulgar or ""in your face"", it's tactful. I really loved it.",e
21,3 April 2013,azanti0029,10, If you want proof that Mads Mikkelsen is one of the finest actors around look no further.,"I would easily rate this film as the best I saw in 2012. Not an easy watch by any means, the story revolves around a Danish Primary School Teacher who is accused of molesting a child from his class. In circumstances that are as believable as they are positively frightening paranoia becomes evidence as the wrong questions are asked by the wrong people and poor Lucas finds himself suspended from his job and becomes the town pariah in a very small community. As the hate and abuse begins to mount and with his own girlfriend doubting him, Lucas wonders if his life will ever be the same as he struggles to try and prove his innocence.",f

25,3 February 2021,DarknessVisible20,9, Human stupidity and hysteria strike again,"I guess I didn't have as much of a shocked reaction to this movie as many others have, as I have seen many lives destroyed by ignorant and evil people in real life, but this was nevertheless a very worthwhile and well-made film. The plot has been discussed in other reviews already. so I won't recap it again. Basically, the movie highlights the damage that ignorance, unfounded assumptions, and the resulting hysteria can do. As I write this in the time of the COVID, we are currently witnessing how entire societies can be brought to their knees when ignorance and hysteria override logic and common sense.
The movie shows that at their core, humans as a whole are still very primitive, operating not on logic and reason, but on fear, hysteria, and pack mentality. The whole hunting theme that runs through the movie serves as a metaphor for this.
Even when the lead character does finally get his life back on track after having it destroyed by hysterical fools, including his so-called friends, the ending proves that these primitive emotions and behaviors are still ever-present. Until we evolve as a species, this will continue to be the case, and many good people will continue to pay the ultimate price as a result.",t

It also shows how in a situation like this people always believe the victim, and try to manipulate them. Mads Mikkelsen is brilliant in this movie.

27,25 July 2015,almosalami,10, Oh my word. This is a masterpiece. This is legit a masterpiece.,"(Before I start, anyone reminded of The Crucible watching this?) The thing most viewers loved about the film was how great the story was. But something I would like to point out and why I say this film is masterful is because you can analyze this film to its core and it gets better and better - not the other way around - and that is something that you can almost never do with most films. That alone is a sign of great writing and directing, and that is of great credit to Thomas Vintenberg and Tobias Lindholm for crafting a consistent tightly-knit story revolving around such a touchy subject, and to those wondering about the name, it very nicely reflects the phrase ""witch-hunt"", which is what people are doing in the film.",u

30,30 June 2016,pere-25366,10, The Hunt - An intriguing look into the human condition,"The first thing I thought when I saw Mads Mikkelson on the poster for The Hunt was ""Hey, isn't that the bad guy from Casino Royale!"" Better known by many for the aforementioned role as well as the titular role in the hit show Hannibal, it would be an understatement to say that Mikkelson bypassed his usual typecast, villainous demeanour with this one. Portraying the life of a divorced father and caring nursery teacher, he elicits the kind of positivity and warmness I felt when watching characters such as C.C. 'Bud' Baxter, played by Jack Lemmon, in The Apartment. He is passive and quirky but ultimately lonely, and this separation sharply contrasts his day to day life, where he is surrounded by playful kids, responsible teachers and the warm environment of nursery school that we as kids can all remember.",
31,12 July 2018,GholamSlayer,10, Heart Wrenching,"I see why Mads Mikkelsen doesn't emote a whole lot in his films. When he does, the emotions he evokes are overwhelmingly tumultuous. Hannibal inspires genuine fear, but here, his vulnerability and agony will tear your soul open, forcing you to look no matter the pain.

35,25 July 2012,ArmyOfSickness,9, It's like a really messed up episode of Kids Say the Darndest Things.,"I just saw The Hunt at the New Zealand International Film Festival and I walked out speechless. The Hunt has such a difficult story to tell but the film makers never go too far with little exposition. The film doesn't take one side over another, making the point that there isn't really any ""bad guys"" in the film, just people on opposite sides of one coin. The script is shocking, tragic and at times funny. The film is very intimately shot with an almost documentary approach. The film is mostly shot hand-held, giving you the feeling of realism. The camera likes to get in close and hold on the actors eyes and it is the eyes that tell the story. Most of the story is told through what was not being said, but instead with looks and pauses. Mads Mikkelsen is stunning as always as the man accused of sexual abuse. He plays the role with such sensitivity to the character but always keeps you guessing throughout the film. Annika Wedderkopp plays the role of the innocent young girl to perfection, again always keeping you guessing. Their relationship being one of the most interesting I've seen on film this year. If I had one complaint it would be that the main plot ends quite abruptly, not leaving me fully satisfied before it goes into the epilogue. The Hunt is drama at its best with beautiful performances from the entire cast. It is hard to explain how great this film is without giving away spoilers but the film gives no clear answers for such a difficult subject and it makes you ask yourself, what would I do?",

And here it comes The Hunt - this is an eight year old movie, nominated for Best Foreign Language in the Oscars (now called Best International Feature Film), coming straight from Denmark starred by the versatile Mads Mikkelsen.
We follow a story of a kindergarten professor, Lucas, not doing so well after a bad divorce having lost his previous job and not having his kid with him. He seems like a regular nice person, and although the struggle in his life he seems to stay positive somehow and has this natural talent with kids who seem to get along well with him, however things will take a dark and sudden turn, when one of the children (daughter of his best friend), due to a short traumatic event associated with a slightly dysfunctional (or care free depending on your take) parenting, and a small crush on her professor, decides to make up a story about a sexual encounter she had with.",

41,19 July 2018,jboothmillard,7, The Hunt,"I spotted this Danish film because of the star of Casino Royale, then I read what it was about, it definitely sounded like a worthwhile watch. Basically Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a well-liked kindergarten teacher in a close-knit Danish community, his hobby is going deer hunting (hence the title). He is divorced and struggles to maintain a relationship with his teenage son, Marcus (Lasse Fogelstrøm), who eventually comes to live with him, and his co-worker Nadja (Alexandra Rapaport) is making advances towards him, eventually becoming his girlfriend. Seven-year-old Klara (Annika Wedderkopp) is one of Lucas' students, she is the daughter of his best friend Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen). She has a crush on Lucas and one day puts a heart-shaped ornament into his coat pocket, she then gives Lucas a kiss on the lips, but he rebuffs it, this hurts her feelings. In anger, drawing on a memory of a pornographic picture her older brother showed her, she makes a comment to the kindergarten director. Klara has a run-away imagination and concocts a lie about her teacher, saying that he indecently exposed himself to her, the directors asks leading questions, but the little girl's answers are unclear. The adults have a meeting to discuss Lucas, the director convinces them of this story of sexual abuse, dismissing Klara's later contradictions as denial, this story soon sweeps across the community. Before Lucas has even been able to understand what is happening, or defend himself, he is shunned by the community as a paedophile and sexual predator, and quickly becomes an outcast of the town. His friendship with Theo and his relationship with Nadja are destroyed, and his son Marcus is publicly ostracised. The teachers ask other kindergarten students leading questions, who also say they have been abused, claiming they have been in Lucas' basement, but this supports his innocence, as he has no basement. Lucas is arrested, but released without charge, but the community are still suspicious of him, and soon the ostracism turns into violence. Lucas' dog Fanny is killed, and a large stone is thrown through his kitchen window, and when he goes grocery shopping, he is attacked by store employees. On Christmas Eve, Lucas confronts Theo during a public church service, while the children are carol singing, but this also turns into a violent exchange. Theo overhears Klara apologising to Lucas for the consequences she has caused, he realises he is innocent, he visits him, bringing food and alcohol, to make a peace offering. A year later, tensions in the community have calmed down, Lucas and Nadja are in a relationship again, and Marcus has been accepted into the local hunting society as an adult. During a hunting expedition, an unseen person apparently shoots at Lucas and misses him, he is unable to see who it is in the sunlight, the attacker, real or metaphorical, disappear, so Lucas is still fearful of his reputation. Also starring Susse Wold as Grethe, Anne Louise Hassing as Agnes, Lars Ranthe as Bruun and Sebastian Bull Sarning as Torsten. Mikkelsen gives an excellent performance as the completely innocent teacher who has been plunged into a nightmare of mass hysteria, a man not without faults, but he never loses our sympathy, it really is a reminder how misinformation, all from one innocent little lie, can snowball into something a massive misunderstanding with severe consequences, a most plausible and tense drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.

It's about humanity, about friendship, alienation and loneliness. Unfortunately, for me the whole cast was unknown, besides the leading role, but they all did a very good job, especially little Klara and her father. The story has a natural flow adding 
tension with every scene until the climax at the very end. Still, the plot is simple but raises so many questions to each one of us. How would I react to such accusation? How would I react being rejected from the society for a stupid reason and for a crime I did not do?
Definitely a very good movie dealing with a sensitive subject!",

His biggest problem is his ex-wife only letting him see their son every other weekend, and after he whines(seemingly an exorbitant amount, even for a teenager), this gets changed. So things are looking up. But then, he faces an accusation of pedophilia, and as things escalate(eventually leading to a few holes punched in the overall credibility), the tension rises(thankfully occasionally pierced(never disappearing completely), made tolerable, by the clever humor - such as our lead's dog barking at every mention of the name of his former bride), and as we realize how easily this could happen to us, we can't escape the terrifying consequences of such a claim... even when it is false. It is completely evident to us that it is not true, and it is about this situation. This does not suggest that the awful crime never happens, but it does shine a light on the fact that we are looking for it everywhere, and many refuse to accept the court's word when someone is found to not have done it. Part of the problem is the idea that we are ""innocent"" until puberty, and our still strained relationship with sexuality. Let me make clear, it should of course never be between kids and adults... however, even at a young age, there may be curiosity, and this is not a bad thing, it's natural and should not be discouraged(lest they actually *do* get issues about it!). The characterization has no one a ""good or bad guy"", we understand everyone and their actions. And the acting is impeccable from everyone concerned. Theo(Bo Larsen, capturing the complexity) is forced to choose between who to believe... his best friend since childhood, or his beloved daughter! And the girl herself, Klara(Wedderkopp, who shows amazing talent... when she is asked to repeat her story to a therapist, we perceive her increasing nervousness through a minor tic with her lower lip; no words needed, and holding up to the scrutiny of close-ups), is as full and real a person as if she were a grown-up. The score is sparse and this uses silence well, rendering it more intimate. We start in the idyllic(the whole thing is set in a small town, and in addition to being ""short"" or ""code"" for witch-hunt, the title can be applied literally), with everyone happy, everything quaint, and as it progresses, this gets further away, to the point where we begin to wonder if we imagined that. The pace does at times drag a tad, and the third act doesn't feel entirely like a climax(in spite of how scary it gets over the course of the 112 minutes). While I have mixed feelings about the very ending, it is in the right spirit. This is a mature, intelligent take on the subject, and will stir up a much-needed debate. Thomas Vinterberg has made another film as good as The Celebration(and I love Submarino). There is a lot of disturbing content, some bloody violence, and brief male full frontal nudity(and references to such) in this. I recommend this to everyone who can ""handle it"". 9/10",

He is extremely talented but, judging by the fact that I love horror films, have seen Silence Of The Lambs numerous times, and figured the television show could never match the talents of the wonderful Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, I wrote it off.

It seems very unfair and get emotionally drained watching this film but the key idea of this film is more than that. He finally clear his name but the scar of false charge is indelible. He gets threatened by anonymous people even after clearing his name. It is amazing that this movie doesn't actually has a villain. Every characters are all reasonable and it is hard to discriminate whose responsible for this tragedy. After a lot of thinking I realized that the real villain of this film is prejudice. The kindergarden teacher and the parents just assume that it was a crime even when there is no actual evidence. This is because of the prejudice that children never lie.

You can really go to town, excoriating a monster. The hastening to judgement, the pell-mell, giddy rush toward it is so well depicted because the film keeps us in the perspective of the one judged and condemned, a chance target for an apparent ready supply of vitriol. That's what's really frightening about the scenario in The Hunt; not that Lucas is accused or who accuses him, but how easily forces are marshalled against him. It's the fearsome eagerness to hate, punish and ostracize that is horrifying. ",

Also, I will add that, in the Los Angeles area in the 1980's, a case not dissimilar to this took place. The McMartin preschool case victimized a school teacher who was falsely accused and the adults investigating the case had dubious methods of attempting to back up their accusations. Now to the aspect of this story that most interests me: All of the characters in this film are suffering from a degree of self loathing that either comes as a result of the accusations or are the initial reasons for the accusations taking place. To elucidate, I would have to turn this review into a spoiler so I won't cite specific reasons for my conclusion. If I am correct, however, this is one of the only films I've ever seen that so vividly shows the internal holocaust that takes place when love is taken from us, how we turn our anger towards ourselves. What was particularly amazing to me is that the protagonist managed to maintain his self respect as long as he did.

1. There are phenomenal performances all-around, but especially from Mads Mikkelsen (Lucas), Thomas Bo Larsen (Theo), Lasse Fogelstrøm (Marcus), and Annika Wedderkopp (Klara).
2. The cinematography takes an incredibly minimalist approach, and it does wonders in letting the viewer just concentrate on the messaging and the contents of the film.
3. The scene wherein Marcus spits on Klara and demands that she confesses to lying, is very powerful and hard-hitting.
4. The movie does a wonderful job at highlighting the stigma men face when working with children, as well as the proclivity of people to instantly side with a woman/ girl over a rape allegation. In addition, it even showcases that even after the rape allegation was proven to be false, the man is never free from its shadow.
5. The jump-scare featuring a rock flying through the window, is expertly timed and effective.
6. The entire church scene, from the Christmas carol sung by the nursery kids, to the framing, the acting, and the long intense pauses, are just cinematic perfection.
7. There is great attention-to-detail, specifically in regards to Theo finally understanding Lucas' innocence by looking into his eyes. This is a call back to earlier in the movie when Theo informed Lucas that he knew when Lucas lied because his eyes twitch.
8. All of the character decisions and reactions feel so genuine and raw, that it adds completely to the horror and grittiness of the atmosphere.

That annoyance definitely did not hinder my enjoyment or how much I rate the film however, if anything it made me rate it even more as I had a strong emotional response right when the problems began to arise. This made every moment nothing but intensely gripping, the smallest of actions or plot points became nail-biting and every moment conflict wasn't resolved became heartbreaking.
However, even know it seems conflict was resolved the ending made me think that it actually wasn't. I'm curious as to any opinions as to what the ending means or what anybody thinks happens because I'm not entirely sure, didn't ruin anything for me at all though it just adds extra thought to an already extremely thought provoking movie.

One day Klara accuses him of sexually abusing her.
It is a great film that introduces us to one of the most controversial topics: crimes of a sexual nature involving minors. In this case, the film focuses on the reaction of the prejudices and grudges that generate this type of accusations in a small community, where the protagonist is stigmatized without any other proof than the mere story of a girl, a story that spreads as hysteria and disturbs all those around the protagonist to the point of attacking him and his loved ones, without even giving rise to doubt.

For me, it is the first movie that truly made me put myself in the mind of the protagonist, victim of a false rumor that slowly but surely destroys his life, piece by piece. It is a scary world we live in where even a little lie can make your world come crashing down, where regardless of how time passes, some things will never be forgotten. By far the best movie that I've ever seen. A hard-watch that will make you want to look away and stayed glued in front of the screen at the same time. Mads Mikelsen gives the performance of a lifetime, while the script delivers one of the realest stories ever to be told in cinema.

Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, the film takes a brave stand on the current obsession with pedophilia, demonstrating that at times the accusing children are the true criminals when the stories are fabricated by the 'abused ones'.

108,7 January 2021,dlmiley,9, Absorbing from beginning to end,"Finally watched this excellent film starring Mads Mikkelsen (you may know him as Dr. Lecter from the Hannibal series). Mikkelsen's character is a respected member of a small community who works as a Kindergarten teacher. He is unfairly accused of sexual abuse by a little girl in his school. As often happens, the adults ask the little girl leading questions and he is arrested and shunned by his community. It is an absorbing drama that makes you really feel for the character. I know of a similar actual case in my old neighborhood where a teacher was unfairly accused - he was cleared but it took about 6 months of investigation to prove he was innocent. As someone else said after being proven innocent - yes, I'm free, but where do I go to get my reputation back?",

I was some way into this film and I thought 'these people are driving me insane, I just want to yell and scream and trash this room!' I looked at the remaining time left on the film (because it was late) and there was still an hour and 10 minutes remaining, I was so close to turning it off thinking I have had enough, but I continued to watch. Luckily so it seemed, because a majority of the situations/individuals that caused my anger and frustration had slipped away. But then this grey cloak tarnishes the atmosphere and you're left with a longing feeling of despair and hopelessness, but only partially, but even if no hope remains, you still must watch this journey unfold. The atmosphere in this film is intense and gripping, the scenes consume you and you are fully absorbed within this story. And the movie takes a turn from this man in a battle where the opponent has absolutely no reason for attacking, to this man who is being attacked and there is nothing he can do about it, though not for a second do you think 'just give in', there isn't a inkling of that, its just 'I must watch this unfold' and bare witness.

The story is a simple one, a man, a teacher, is wrongly accused os sexually misconduct with a young child and his community, filled with old friends and acquaintances, turn on him and make his life a living hell.
The movie is full extremely intense scenes that make you shift uneasily on you chair.
A smart decision it that Vinterberg doesnt show anything about investigation or the prosecution. it isnt important for the story, because the audience knows Lucas is innocent. instead, the director only shows the way lucas friends react and cope with the situation. Jagnet is filmed a reallistic style, without many cinematographic effects. the emotionality of the story and the strong acting are enough to carry the movie.

The subject matter has certainly been covered before, or related matters, as in the pivotal 1961 film, The Children's Hour. However, in my opinion, this film hit the best pitch in emotion and the precision with which it deals with the delicate circumstances and devastations involved. I was spellbound by Mads Mikkelsen's performance. Just when I thought he would do something drastic or the film would lapse into melodrama, it all stayed the course. It is a film about forgiveness, all kinds of forgiveness, forgiveness for the self and for others. But lest we forget, and the film artfully doesn't let us, forgiveness doesn't always occur and is one of the hardest tasks we have in life, or that is what I took from it; others will take something else. I was very moved and held in deep emotional suspense by this film, which is what the best films do. Just brilliant, on all levels, by all involved.

123,30 January 2016,KineticSeoul,9," Yes, even children can lie!","This is a film where it's sole purpose isn't to entertain particularly but to hit the core of human emotions. How coming up with assumptions and buying into gossip can really effect people's lives. This really is a film that really got to me and made me angry and sad. Not because it's a bad movie, actually it's far from it being a bad movie. It's a film that shows the effects and how it would feel if you were in the shoes of the main protagonist in this. Who basically is a victim that gets ostracized, put down and treated unfairly when they don't even know what really happened. I think the first time I seen Mads Mikkelsen in a film was in ""Casino Royale"" and thought he was actually a stand out villain in the Bond franchise. And he puts on a stand out performance in this, where the emotions of anger, depression and love just came off so raw and real. It didn't seem pretentious or like he was trying hard to show off his acting chops but to show a real character going through unfairness. So the plot is about a guy named Lucas who is a good hearted man that likes children and lives in a small community while working at a kindergarten. He gets accused of putting a child in a sexually touching one of the kids and exposing himself to the child. The child actually told a lie and fabricated the whole thing, the thing about lies is that once you do it, you can come up with more lies to cover up the first one. And that is what happens, thus it leads Lucas getting ostracized and treated less than a human being, actually worst then a dog. Adults can have this perception that children are super innocent and can't tell a lie. Well even children can lie, and lacks the empathy to understand the pain they cause others sometimes as well. The pain Lucas goes through, it really does hits you emotionally as an audience. I know the character that told the lie in the first place is only a child, but I immensely disliked her because of her actions. This film really delves into the human conscious and the breakdown of being judged. And how time can help cope with certain scars, but sometimes it doesn't go away and when you are labeled as something. That label can follow you for the rest of your life. Overall, this is a emotionally powerful film that doesn't try to be more than what it is. And I respect it for that.",

Expertly crafted by director Thomas Vinterberg and writer Tobias Lindholm, The Hunt is a brutally raw tale of a teacher whose personal and working life has been swung upside down by one of his students, after she tells an innocent little lie to her principal, which changes his life forever. This is the best performance Mads Mikkelsen has ever given and even with its harsh subject matter, I can easily see this being a film I go back and rewatch because of how well things come together.

However, after seeing this movie, I'll absolutely be on the lookout for more work by him. He portrays the character of Lucas in this movie so powerfully that, near the end of the film, it was genuinely difficult for me to hold back tears - knowing just how much pain he's gone through, both mentally and physically.

It's important that it exists because even though it may seem unlikely, this could happen to literally anyone. It's such a brutal and hard-hitting film to watch because his man's life is being torn apart in front of your eyes and you feel so helpless to stop it. The film actually lets him off in a way (not entirely but at least in the eyes of the law) and while I was thankful for that from a spectators perspective I'm not entirely sure how realistic that was.

133,29 April 2014,l_rawjalaurence,8, Profoundly Unsettling Portrait of Paranoia within an Isolated Community,"Other reviewers have commented very cogently on the film's thematic preoccupations with the ways in which allegations of pedophilia can ruin a person's life, even if they have not done anything. What is perhaps most noteworthy about Thomas Vinterberg's film is the way in which the story has been told: with no music to influence the viewers' attitude towards the characters, or set the mood for each sequence, we are left to make up our minds for ourselves. Charlotte Bruus Christensen's camera focuses relentlessly on the characters' expressions through tight close-ups: we see the way in which Lucas' (Mads Mikkelsen) life is ruined through the way in which he begins to look wildly about him, as if fearful of reprisal. The sequence taking place on Christmas Day where Lucas sits in a pew and looks behind him at his best friend Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen) is particularly effective; through a series of shot/reverse shots, we see Theo's face becoming more and more anxious as he understands just how much mental strain Lucas undergoes. The sequence builds up to an uncomfortable climax as the two men are seen in two-shot, with Lucas grabbing Theo's lapels and shaking him. In the background, the carols sung by the infants' choir stop abruptly, and everyone stares at the two men. Vinterberg's film is intelligently set around the changing seasons, running from autumn to Christmas; as the festive season approaches, so life becomes more and more unbearable for Lucas: so much for the season of goodwill. The title is deliberately ambiguous: not only referring to the annual winter hunt - where all the menfolk gather in good-natured celebration of a time-honored ritual, but to the way Lucas is hunted by the rest of his community. We are left to reflect on the ways in which the menfolk seem blissfully unaware of this distinction, even a year after the pedophile incident has supposedly occurred. This oversight paves the way for a seriously uncomfortable ending during the annual deer hunt, where we learn the extent to which Lucas' life has been ruined. A profoundly unsettling piece, of especial significance today, when so many scandals involving alleged pedophiles seem to be coming to light,",

The Hunt is a Danish film concerning the a man named Lucas, played by Mads Mikkelsen. You may know him as the Bond villain from Casino Royale or as Hannibal Lecter in the show Hannibal. He's a phenomenal actor and he really shows that here (I'd be surprised if didn't get nominated for this). In this film, he plays an innocent- minded teacher. What I love about this movie is that it's so grounded and real. You really believe that this guy, Lucas, is a real person and everything that happens in the movie is so believable. He's a recently divorced guy who's close to getting custody of his son; he's starting a new relationship; as a teacher, all the kids love him. His life is a pretty positive one at the moment, until... one little girl decides to tell a little lie and falsely accuse him of sexually harassing her. And even though there's no evidence of this, Lucas's life begins to crumble. It all happens so realistically and that's credit to the writing and direction of this movie. When I watched this movie, I literally sat forward in my seat, motionless, witnessing the events of the film unfold. There's no special effects or spectacular events; it's just pure raw emotion in an intensely believable situation. One of the best compliments I can give a foreign-language film is that I forget that I'm reading the subtitles because I'm so engrossed in what's happening. To me, this is one of the best crafted films of recent years. Not everyone can watch it because a lot of people would find it boring or uninteresting, but it is just beautiful to me.",

In fact, the characters never feel like movie characters. They feel like humans you can talk, relate and feel them, which is the biggest praise this movie can get. The real life part is what makes this movie strong, since everything feels natural and believable. Nothing feels superficial, forced or even a movie.

144,10 July 2014,raulfaust,9, Antiheroes of the world,"Well, the guy from my local videostore has told me that this film would be slow paced, but, from the moment that Klara kissed Lucas in the mouth on, the storyline became extremely involving, so I may disagree with that guy. For a moment, I had the impression that everyone around felt like kissing Lucas haha, even thought he never seemed to give such liberty to people. After the young girl tells the school's principal that Lucas showed his genitals to her, the story became extremely AGONIZING, due to absurd behavior from most of the people-- including school's principal, Grethe. I mean, child abusing is a SERIOUS accusation, and people should've been much more cautious on dealing with that. You know, hold on to the police investigation and stop telling everyone around what the guy has supposedly done; if he really did that, let the authorities do their job. The directing is AMAZING, and it lets the spectator notices what characters are feeling; for instance, when Lucas goes to Theo's house to explain what happened, you can see in Theo's face that, in the first seconds, he was like ""I don't wanna talk to you"". After some seconds, he'd change his expression to something like ""I really hate you, but I admit that I should listen to what you have to say, in respect of our friendship"". And that's something that directors rarely are able to do. James Foley did in a similar way in 1996 ""Fear"". The only thing that I disliked about this movie is how fictional it gets sometimes; I mean, would Danish society react that way to someone accused of pedophilia? We all know how developed is such society, so it feels implausible for me to see such reaction. However, the movie as a whole is extremely touching, agonizing and affectionate, and I don't see a reason why someone can hate it. This is one of the best movies made in 2012, for sure.",

Because that's precisely what director Thomas Vinterberg is looking for as he works up a deftly-crafted drama that's both unnerving and significant. I also knew at once that ""The Hunt"" would be one affirmed adversary for the Academy Award for Best-Foreign Language Film. I haven't followed the works of Vinterberg closely so I had zilch idea of what to expect. Contrary to my doubts, the initial viewing of ""The Hunt"" knocked the wind out of me. The movie starts out as a limping drama and Vinterberg spends a large part of the first hour building his story and characters and giving them enough time to turn into someone we know. How well he succeeds is something you find out in the second half. A jolting drama that works as a rattling thriller, ""The Hunt"" spares no one as it follows the crumbling life of Lucas, a divorced ex-teacher, as he is wrongly accused by a small girl of sexual abuse.",

Even though, Mad's Lucas is unjustly accused it doesn't matter to the parents who systematically turn him into a pariah and social outcast. It really was heartbreaking to watch. One element I did like was the minimalistic approach to scoring and naturalistic scene composition, which eliminates any pretense and lets the subject matter speak for itself rather than deliberately pushing any emotional buttons.

151,19 December 2017,Screen_Blitz,9, Mads Mikkelson soars with an uncompromising performance in this haunting Danish drama about the loss of innocence,"Danish director Thomas Vinterberg's The Hunt is a dark, powerful, and remarkably haunting testament of a human's innocence crumbled by a misunderstood lie, and the repercussions that follow when the ones who hold your trust the most immediately turn on you before you know it. Whether Vinterberg is taking inspiration from specific real-life events leads little to be known, but the sad news is the events that transpire within the near-two-hour runtime occur to people all around the world more often than many realize. In today's society, it is not uncommon for the innocent victim to be robbed of justice. So what is the topic here? The topic is sexual assault, a major issue that has run rampant throughout society like the plague while innocence of victims, or, in some cases, the wrongly accused hides in the dark as evil prevails with no obstacles to be set free. Mads Mikkelson takes the lead role in the story of a man who is caught at the business end of everyone's cruel misunderstanding while he watches as his life is sucked into a downward spiral. By the end to the film, it is nearly impossible to keep your heart intact from the sheer emotional destruction that follows. This film tells the story of Lucas (played by Mads Mikkelson), a divorced kindergarten teacher who appears to have his life in shape. The children at school love him like a father, and he is dating a beautiful woman (played by Alexandra Rappaport) who hopes to marry. But things get weird when he discovers that one of the girls in his class has somewhat of a crush on him. Lucas believes it is just part of her weird imagination. However, when the girl unexpectedly makes up a story about him doing some sexual misconduct to her, he becomes a target of hatred and hostility by the community including the girl's father (played by Thomas Bo Larsen), her mother (played by Anne Louis Hassing), and the community as a whole as he struggles to prove he is innocent.

A series of events lead a student, Klara(a magnificent Annika Wedderkopp), to tell an administrator that Lucas has been sexually inappropriate with her. Little by little, the beloved teacher becomes an outcast to former friends and neighbors. Almost no one believes that a child could make up such a story. It goes from bad to worse for Lucas as the days and weeks go by. Without giving away too much, I will only say, stay with this riveting drama and you will not be disappointed. The acting, the script, and the cinematography are excellent, and The Hunt is one of the best films of the year.",

The authorities don't find any basis to prosecute the alleged abuse, but this means little to a town with a lynch mob mentality. Dogged by suspicion, Lucas finds his livelihood upended, his relationships strained, and his peace menaced. Wise beyond her years, the student admits her foolishness and proclaims the teacher's innocence, but this falls upon dead ears.

Perhaps it's more fitting to watch it now with the recent story about the man in the UK who was burnt to death for the accusation of being a paedophile. It's a terrifying and utterly impossible stigma when it's false. And the first hour of The Hunt is built on the impending doom of that setup. The first few sequences keep you tense as you see Lucas innocently interact with kids. This half is really well-written and utilises its slow burn pace with precision.

In a town where your passage to manhood is a hunting license, what we would be more natural than to hunt for any aberration or exception to the norm. And if anybody dares to attack our offspring, all bets are off. Friendly, though highly imbibing companionship, quickly transforms into a vigilante pack of rabid wolves.

178,14 July 2020,christopher-underwood,6, the unstoppable fire of the modern day witch hunt,"Writer/director Thomas Vinterberg clearly meant well here as he concocts a film based on a number of sad but true cases of false accusations of child abuse in Scandinavia. Such cases, of course, can happen anywhere and although the child's comments may, though not always, be the initial spark, it is inevitably the actions and accusations of others that speeds the unstoppable fire of the modern day witch hunt. Vinterberg's tale is well enough relayed with good central performance but there are one or two problems and it seems to me that central to these is the director's reluctance to fully rid himself of the shackles of Dogme95. Working under self imposed restrictions can stimulate otherwise unconsidered and creative impulses but here the refusal to use flashbacks is disastrous. The insistence upon a strict linear structure means that we have an unduly restricted view of events. There is no chance for us, the viewer, to fully engage, to perhaps consider one or other guilty or not guilty, we are simply presented with the events and the inevitable unrolling of the consequences. It would have helped enormously if we could have been convinced that the crime took place and then be forced to reconsider, instead of plodding relentlessly along behind the seeming natural prejudice of all around. As it is we are stuck feeling sorry for the main protagonist throughout the film and finally even beginning to consider that yes, maybe it was his fault, which cannot have been the original intention.",

194,5 May 2013,gregking4,8," not an easy film to sit through, but it is a rewarding experience","The Hunt is a powerful, disturbing and provocative Danish drama about an innocent man who becomes the victim of a terrifying witch hunt that destroys his life and reputation in a small town. Lucas (played by Mads Mikkelsen) is an out of work teacher helping out at the local kindergarten. He is popular amongst the kids and the other staff. He also enjoys socialising with his closest friend Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen) and drinking with his friends and even hunting deer with them. But that all changes when, in a fit of jealousy, Theo's six-year-old daughter Klara (Annika Wedderkopp) says something that leads both her parents and the school headmistress to accuse him of acting inappropriately towards her. And we the audience are helpless, and we squirm in out seats uncomfortably as we watch him become persecuted by his friends and former colleagues. The film has elements of Arthur Miller's classic The Crucible as it explores the damage done by innuendo as malicious gossip and rumours become truth, and a collective state of hysteria takes hold on the tight knit community. Lucas's sense of angst and injustice is palpable. There is a horrific scene in a supermarket, when the owner and a clerk savagely attack Lucas while he is doing his shopping, and this is hard to watch because of its brutality. But the damage is done, and even is unable to change the course of events, as no-one will believe her when she finally admits the truth. The Hunt is the new feature film from Thomas Vinterberg. Along with Danish director Lars Von Trier Vinterberg is one of the founders of the Dogma movement, which says that filmmakers must use natural lighting, no external music, and all action must serve the story. His film Festen (or The Celebration) was made under that manifesto. But he has torn up the rule book here, and The Hunt is all the better for it. His direction is restrained here. The film has been beautifully shot by cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen. And Vinterberg draws a career best performance from Mikkelsen, who played the villain in the Bond movie Casino Royale. He can currently be seen as a younger incarnation of psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter in the new TV series Hannibal. Mikkelsen normally has an intense and imposing physical presence on the screen. However here he is more restrained and delivers a subtle, nuanced performance that plays up his vulnerabilities and helplessness. Lucas is presented as a sympathetic figure whose life has already suffered enough blows - he is bitterly divorced from his wife and has a troubled relationship with his estranged teenage son. His mesmerising performance of quietly seething rage thoroughly deserved the best actor award he received at Cannes last year. And in her first film newcomer Wedderkop is frighteningly assured in a terrifyingly realistic performance as the malicious little girl whose accusation starts the chain of events that destroy Lucas's life. However, there is a slight misstep towards the end, although it is difficult to decide just how Vinterberg and his co-writer Tobias Lindholm could have satisfactorily resolved the festering atmosphere of suspicion and distrust that they have created. I caught this film at the Melbourne International Film Festival last year, and it left an impression that is hard to forget. The Hunt is not an easy film to sit through, but it is a rewarding experience for those who make the effort.",

Few are matured in other ways. Matured enough to even lie about you. Yes, they do. This movie contradicts the evident truth that ""Kids don't lie"". The story is very original and screenplay is first-rate. Mads Mikkelson (the guy who played villain in Casino Royale) is the central character in this movie gave a mind-blowing show. All other actors were fine and the child 'Klara' was unforgettable. Music is ultra-reduced but I'd say it is for good. The major demerit is in the second-half where the adult members of the village misbehave with the hero (imo, its too unreal, extreme and hyped) in various scenes. But this demerit gets overshadowed by its list of positives mentioned above. The bottom line : the movie is one of the strongest contenders for the academy.",

There is not one person to blame for what happens, to point your finger at. Mainly, people just do what they think is their duty of protection. The oversteps are small and subtle at first, some prejudgment kicks in, things evolve inevitably. Later, of course, there are also those expressing themselves in what they think is justified violence. Isn't it all so obvious and realistic?

Lucas (Mikkelsen, in his Cannes BEST ACTOR winning role) is a divorced kindergarten teacher, a tender-hearted, restrained man who loves his work, then one day, out of blue, he is accused of sexually abusing Klara (Wedderkopp), the young daughter of his best friend Theo (Larsen). Soon, his entire life begins to unravel, and from the beginning, Vinterberg gives audience a clear view that Lucas is innocent, so by accompanying him through his purgatory, everyone in front of the screen can ask himself/herself the disheartening question, what is wrong with our society?

While watching a movie, you can often think about yourself and your life, if you look without a sexual subtext and do not look for it, because there not. The only piece of life. Not surprisingly and everything clear, as a hasty society makes conclusions based on only on their fears, and the most important thing that they, as in real, assume something and in the way, they would like to believe. During the ""investigation"" someone obviously did not have enough of adrenaline, as they were provoking her a lie, and she did not say anything, only make some head noodle when you someone pushes. And only that single case when she was angry at Lucas, and only because the girl was disappointed and angry because in kindergarten life parents forgetting about her in some way and arguing on each other, so girl feels some love and idealization of this one person who cares. And her fantasies fall down as in real world. All of this gives us an idea of ​​how the formation of relationships is shaping up in all of us, fantasies, many thoughts and the exploration of the world - everything that children can and see and sometimes understand not well. I want to say that often adults take these child principles into adulthood, fantasies and after it a disappointment. And of course, children can lie and manipulate to parents and others, so they get attention, and this is natural. Lucas was good, kind, but it was bad, he became a victim, and played a victim. It's hard, but showing strength and being more courageous in defending the truth could all be easier to turn up. But, after all really hard events, he became such that he was angry, and that's good, very, it changes, and he changed and he became more courageous and not to lose a friendship, but the past has in mind, and hard to live after that like a couple that lost the kid in ""Manchester by the Sea"" movie, if you saw, and he can hardly live like previous, he is worried, and people as nothing happened to continue to live their normal lives and it's normal and some way interesting, why it hard to him, thoughts and worries. Everything that was happening at that time was fear. Fear controls and with feel aggression and there are people who still remain and still manages with fear after a year of events. Powerful film and so many psychological aspects of which you can write more details (but I have bad English and lazy to put more) and take a look at your life and defend it and do not break in front of a society that thinks individually about yourself, above all.

218,9 March 2017,paul2001sw-1,9, The fragility of the social contract,"The presumption of innocence until proved guilty is an essential building block of a free society. In times of tyranny - say, in Stalin's Russia, or McCarthey's America, this is reversed, and the individual is charged with being free from suspicion. This immediately voids the idea of freedom under the law - suspicious behaviour, however so construed, become de facto prohibited; as well as exposing individuals to allegations from cranks and the malicious. But the presumption of innocence is a hard thing for a society to maintain. Supposing someone is accused of something terrible - there may be no concrete proof, but how can such a person expect to be treated by their neighbours? This question is asked in Thomas Vintenberg's film 'The Hunt', which deals with one of the most difficult subjects in our contemporary world, namely child abuse. Child abuse, once ignored, is now rightly considered a very bad thing, but has perhaps been demonised out of proportion to its wickedness - sometimes, you get the sense that society considers a paedophile to be worse than a murderer. In Vinternberg's tale, an innocent man is falsely accused, then formally acquitted - but there's no easy path to his rehabilitation once the accusation has been levelled. Vintenberg is a brilliant film-maker and does a wonderful job at getting us to sympathise with his protagonist through his nightmarish experience; and yet, we also feel for the parents of the child who makes the allegation, and for the child herself. It's a film to make you angry, sad, and scarred at the same time - scared above all else of the delicate basis on which our integration in society depends.",

This is filmmaking of a very high order and many will miss its subtleties and instead glob onto the drama of its main plot. This movie is closer to Ibsen and For Whom The Bell Tolls and The Scarlet Letter than it is to today's typical cinema. The initial 40 minutes or so are perfect in terms of acting, directing and writing. Maybe, just maybe, the film should have ended about 10 minutes earlier than it does--but the closing works very well too. The portrait of mankind here is grim, dark and well-deserved, sad to say.",

We hear, read lots of news about sexual harassment's nowadays. Do we really care how many were true at the end. It may be a small percent but what is happening to the accused who were actually innocent and acquitted by law. Climax of the movie says it all, he will be hunted for life time. Its so sad that we are living in a world where we can't openly express our love, emotions even to a child! Rather have to think consequences it may create. Most times people are judgmental and you may not even get a chance to explain. On the other hand its true that child harassment is drastically increasing.

225,14 February 2015,ayoe-lang,5, So disappointed,"I had been looking forward to this movie for ages. For some reason it kept eluding me. But finally I sat down to watch it...and as intended, I was outraged, appalled and absolutely disappointed - but because of the terrible plot. This movie might have worked, if it was set in the 1930's, but this takes place in 2014 and it makes absolutely no sense what so ever. I get the idea of making a big deal of nothing, Mob tendencies, twisting everything to create drama, joint discrimination and so on and so forth - all of that and again the movie could have worked for me, if set in 1930 or something, but all it really did was p*ss me off, because none of this would never EVER happen in Denmark today!! To begin with, there has been so much taboo in the 80's about male daycare workers molesting children, that today everyone is extremely careful to make assumptions about it. It is handled with the utmost care. Second, the first thing you would do in any such situation is contact the parents. This is something daycare workers are taught. You would never let a psychologist or anyone else talk to the child without the parents consent. They would have to be informed for this to take place. It would never happen without their knowledge. Third, the way this psychologist put words in the child's mouth? WOULD NOT HAPPEN!!! This was the most horrible part - they tried so hard to make it disgusting and I was disgusted by the abysmal way this interview was happening. Nevermind the fact the parents always have to be present. But there are extremely clear guidelines to this kind of interview. None of which was used. And lastly I'll mention all the violence and assaults that nobody bothers to report to the police? Come on!! There are just so many errors in this movie that I had an extremely hard time watching it to the end. And this was our Oscar contribution? I'm embarrassed, because we Danes make amazing movies. This wasn't one of them.",
226,14 December 2013,adamsdavid92,9, One man's struggle against life's unfairness.,"A film about how unjust life is. About evil, the meaning of truth and forgiveness. A film about life itself, encompassed in a single life story, so unlike anything you've ever heard of, that it keeps you breathless and on the verge of tears throughout. It's better than anything I've seen in a long time, thanks to its originality and truthfulness. It's premise is so uncommon, any reaction from the characters seems real, since you never know what someone in that situation would do. In all, it brings out some of the worst problems in life, lead by unfairness and the prevalence of lies. There's a glimpse of hope near the end, when human forgiveness is shown in a flicker, but ultimately distrust prevails. ""The world is full of evil but if we hold on to each other, it goes away.""",

The acting were great specially Mads Mikkelse (Lucas) with his innocent look and I feel sympathy with him. other parts of movie were awesome and i can't say something wrong about film.

As Roger Ebert once appropriately put, ""The audience is concerned with the lives that are not its own."" Jagten or The Hunt is a film that works because of empathy. The protagonist is an innocent man whose life is torn apart because of an innocent lie. There is injustice, but no one exactly responsible for it. All you can do is hope that matters get well for our protagonist. You're so easily invested in the character that it leaves you feeling angered and gloomy for the events he has to go through. I believe most of the credit has to go to Mads Mikkelsen.",

Some reviewers have found it hard to believe that the director of the daycare center and the psychologist (or whoever that rumpled old guy is) who's called in to investigate could still subscribe to the long-discredited ""believe the children!"" thesis, or that Lucas, after his initial confrontation with his accusers, would do so little to exonerate himself. I didn't—lots of similar cases were reported on in the US in the 80s and 90s, and Lucas does lawyer up after the cops get involved; it's not clear what else he could have done. And even if the screenwriters did cut a few corners here, they do a beautiful job of dramatizing the trivial series of events, witnessed only by the camera and the little girl, Klara, that sets all this in motion. The plot is never predictable (except maybe for one scene—you'll know which one I mean); dramatic tension is sustained to the very last shot. The five-year-old actress who plays Klara is totally convincing; nice touch that Klara seems to have some symptoms of OCD, which makes her dreaminess and distraction even more poignant. Btw, I just read in another review that Vinterberg wanted to set this film in Canada, where the good-old-boy deerhunter culture of the village could have been much more intense. Here the deerhunting seems to take place in a game preserve that's attached to a handsome manor house—very Old World.

289,8 February 2014,oscaralbert,8, There's something rotten in Denmark . . .,". . . and it's spelled ""m-e-n,"" according this this Danish expose, THE HUNT. Here in the United States, no man would dare be by himself with his best friend's 5-year-old daughter, let alone supervise a whole playground full of kindergärtners! As THE HUNT proves, the least little teacher comment perceived in a negative way by a child will result in wild molestation accusations, as likely as not, and then it's only a matter of time before an outraged public will kill your pets, beat up your kids, and burn down your house. As school principal Grethe states here, ""children never lie,"" and where there's smoke, there's sure as heck to be Hellfire. That's why here in America the majority of men sport the patented ""Privates Cam"" underwear brand, which records their junk in High Def 24\7. Sure, those Danes ""letting it all hang out"" in THE HUNT's opening skinny-dipping scene may say that the American ""Privates Cam"" is an invasion of privacy, but since our McMartin Pre-School Witch Hunt, no thinking U.S. man has left home without one. If the accused ""Lucas"" character in THE HUNT had worn a ""Privates Cam"" for excursions outside his home, this flick would have been an hour shorter. When ""Klara"" told her lie, Principal Grethe could have just yanked out his ""Privates Cam,"" fast-forwarded through the previous few weeks, and seen for herself that ""Lucas"" only brought out his Johnson to ""pay the water bill"" and entertain his grown-up co-worker.

Of course, it helps that we as the audience know that no such act was ever committed, allowing for an almost heartbreaking tale of neighbour turning on neighbour and our somewhat inactive yet extremely empathetic protagonist trying to keep his life from spiralling totally out of control. The lead is deftly portrayed by Mads Mikkelsen in a rare, but well-fitting, non-villainous role. The piece is engaging, powerful stuff. 8/10",

Mads Mikkelsen's portrayal of an unjustly accused man is brilliant. You become completely engrossed in the man's struggle and your heart breaks scene after scene for the dilemma he is in. Mikkelsen is able to capture the loyalty of the audience and bring you on this hideous journey even when the topic leaves you squirming in your seat. You feel how uncomfortable he is from the very beginning and evolve with the character as he discovers that those closest to him are able to turn their backs on an instant. The supporting cast is equally as talented. You feel engulfed in this community's problems and can envision how such a misunderstanding can occur.This movie had us talking for hours about the dilemma of accusation and truth.

The Hunt delves in almost every human emotion known and it knows how to stick a knife in your back and never let go. This film shows dehumanization as the public emotionally (and sometimes even physically) destroys a man played by Mads Mikkelsen. His character Lucas is accused of raping his best friends daughter and the film shows before hand that Lucas is a good man by subtle touches to his dialogue and his ability to deal with the situation even though it has become the worse case scenario. From the script, to the screenplay, and especially to the acting, this film has become cinema heaven and gives me chills that rattles me to the very core every time I watch it. Its almost a social experiment that expresses how low humans will go by hearing just a little white lie. If you watch this film, take a seat, get comfortable, and be ready to get your ass kicked.",

Not always, and children do lie, but I cringe a little at the premise given the reality, though it's fair to say that the film uses this as a way of exploring human nature, and just how quickly people even in a tight-knit community will turn on someone. I think the storytelling would have been better had the audience not known what the truth is, the ambiguity of which would have made all of its scenes more interesting.

Jagten ( the hunt) was a movie about a person that lives in a community who tries to prove his innocence about a charge. Clara sees in Lukas face the ''real '' father or better the father that she wanted to have. Thomas Vinterber doesn't show clearly the bad connection between Theo and Clara. For me the problem was that this ''lie'' from Clara that Lukas showed her his willie was too fast and surprised me . In addition, this unclearness lifted if we consider that Thomas (director) wanted to show the way people act when they want to expel a person from a community. The thrown rock and the man with the carbine who shot Lukas was not one person specific but the society which doesn't forget about the category had given to Lukas. Furthermore Thomas shows the way societies work. I want to insist in this because this is the main idea of this movie. Everything that disturbed a society wants to expel this because thinks that this person is responsible for the bad process of her. Also I wanted to see how Lukas managed to become again part of his town and how people introduce him . Because to conclude with the scene with the carbine means that more things than once had become but Thomas skipped them . This director is very similar to Lars Von Trier . There is a difference that must be said. When Lars wants to sock the viewers he shows something extreme . Thomas Vinterberg managed to sock us with the scenery of Jagten because no one expected that Clara would say that thing that she said. And furthermore no one expected that people of his town who know Lucas for many years will react like that way . That's the extreme and this is the reason that Thomas reminded me Lars . Lars wants to attract the viewers by showing scenes extreme instead of Thomas who surprises us from the basic structural of his movie (Clara said that unbelievable lie and locals believed her because '' children always say true'' in contrary to Lucas who is a teacher and an adult with a son.

It juxtaposes a tightly knit Scandinavian town with an eerily empty feeling soundscape. Horror is ever-present in the open daylight environment, where society itself is an inescapable oppressor. Taking clear inspiration from the 1980s' Satanic Panic in the US, this film tells the harrowing tale of Lucas, a nursery worker who is at the centre of a moral panic. He and his family suffer to their breaking point, brought to life by the fantastic Mads Mikkelsen who brings a sort of subtle suffering.

308,28 April 2017,sol-,7, Hunted,"This Danish drama focuses on a kindergarten teacher accused of child abuse due to the lies of a female student, upset over the teacher scolding her for kissing him. Mads Mikkelsen is effective in the lead as his life slowly unravels with a suddenly tarnished reputation, but it is hard to sympathise with him when much of his misery is his own fault. It never makes sense that he does not report the kiss, nor talk to the girl's parents given that he is close friends with them. In fact, it is hard to say what exactly Thomas Vinterberg was trying to convey here as the townsfolk who turn against Mikkelsen start putting words in the girl's mouth, suggesting what may have happened and with the girl's own mother telling her that she is just repressing when she finally admits to lying! The film would almost work as an indictment of how paranoid modern societies about suspected child abuse if it were not for the townsfolk coming off as plain ignorant. The movie is well-filmed whatever the case, with hand-held shots sublimely capturing his anger when Mikkelsen returns to work and finds others talking about him. There is also a lot to like in the genuine bond that exists between Mikkelsen and the girl, accusations aside, but this is a tricky film to watch with the regrettable actions of not only the whole town but the protagonist himself who could have so easily avoided the whole ordeal by reporting a simple kiss.",

When innocent children are involved, fair trials take a back seat to the natural human response of suspicion and rage.

323,30 April 2014,kaymages,9," A very nice film. Realistic, truthful, meaningful.","This is a film that surprised me in a good way.I honestly don't remember the last years seeing many films like it. Truthful, meaningful and realistic. Depicting a story that can happen to anyone of us, and not like the usual annoyingly distorted fairy tales of how the directors THINK the world is but rather as we live it (unlike von trier's nymphomaniac which i saw recently and just sighed for the time i wasted). I found myself in the end troubled, reconsidering some beliefs and a bit shocked in a good way though (more like alarmed and awakened i could call it). A good man,that loves his work as a nursery school teacher, lives in a small town and is divorced with a young son that lives with his mother. He works around children which he loves a lot that's why he became a teacher in the first place. But this parent-like love of his, is soon being misinterpreted for something dark and perverted due to a misunderstanding that started as a rumor which will prove though to be grave and destructive. He turns down the feelings of a little girl in the nursery school and she comes up with a story as a revenge, inspired by a porn pic she saw on her brother's PC. She says to the headmistress that he showed her his ""willie"" which was even ""pointy as a rod"" as she heard her brother's friend saying. The thought bothers like a splinter the headmistress's head for a day long till she finally decides to tell the event to the girl's mother and to the other parents of the kids. The rumor was presented in a relatively believable way so it consequently was established as a truth. His friends with whom he was drinking and laughing the other day now hate him and try to keep him away. At some point they even went so far as to attacking him and even killing his dog Fanny and leaving it in a garbage bag in front of his house. So we have a man's life being turned upside down in the blink of an eye by a little girl that wants to avenge him because he rejected her romantic feelings (as much serious as these can be for a 4 years old). It is an insightful journey on herd mentality, on unconscious malicious feelings manifesting even towards our once beloved people when circumstances permit it, and of the pathology and danger a child can bear despite the idealistic common belief that children are de facto sinless or ""can never lie"" as the headmistress says. As it is proved they can lie and not just lie but destroy someone's life in a single day. Added to their poor lack of judgment, ignorance of consequences, and poor memory as the case was in the specific story a ""little lie"" can be proved big enough to bring someone's life to ruins. I want to congratulate the director on this because for me it was the first time i saw this reality being brought to the light of cinema and be analyzed in it's defining components. The strength of friendship being tested to it's extremes as the girl's father happens to be the teacher's best friend among with other fathers. And the integrity and value of the modern societal ordinance of cities being questioned and exploited under the light of it's potential or maybe even innate pathogenies. Also the very important realization that teachers should keep that discreet ""healthy distance"" between them and the children, no matter their age, cause first it's the proper educational thing, and of course so that any possible misfortune would be avoided. A film that despite being a little slow paced got me hanging from my chair till the very end.",

The direction and acting throughout is, I would say, flawless. Despite the film's dark and uncomfortable topic, it goes about it in a poignant and thought provoking way. We see how a divorced man desperately wanting custody of his teenage son, is unjustly faced with the baffling accusation of sexually abusing a young girl. Not only is he a teacher at a kindergarten but the young girl is the daughter of his best friend. The film presents how quickly a little lie can explode into something that can ultimately ruin a persons life. Yet what is so masterfully created by both actor and director is complete understanding for each character and the position their faced with. ",

The topic itself is delicate and something it can happen in real life, so how the director tells it is crucial. He describes the event and leads the story in calming (but not slow) pace and mostly factually, leaving judgement or emotions of audience in the hand of Mikkelsen. It is such a unique but interesting cinematic experience; Story-wise, I understand each character's action and the reason behind it. There is no villain in the story, and the narrative is very objective. At the same time, I feel really complex emotions: not just simple emotions such as anger, sadness, or dejection but the mix of all, and strong emotions based on Mikkelsen's portrayal of Lucas.

341,11 August 2021,fciocca,8, How a little lie can ruin the life of a man.,"Once I finished this movie I felt a bunch of different emotions. I was enraged by the fact that a little lie, told for trivial reasons can ruin the life of a man and his family. How can a small community base his judgement on a voice, without any proof. The happiness and joy of a respected member of a small town, turned into despair and sadness when everyone turns his back and starts to be aggressive verbally and physically. ""The Hunt"" is a painful film and it touches on a very sensitive matter that unfortunately happens for real. Having your reputation torn for the rest of your life, no matter if you are innocent, no matter if authorities prove that you did not commit the crime, is one of the worst faiths that I could possibly imagine. The director captured this greatly. The performance of Mads Mikkelsen is extremely believable, and manages to depict Lucas as a man that is spiraling down into madness, as he does not know how to face up such accusations. Thomas Larsen did also an amazing job, and he carried all the weight of a father that is completely shocked and does not know how to react and what to think about his best friend.",

I had to pause the movie three times out of anger and frustration with the main character, Lucas. He is so unrealistic and unhealthy as a human being that he actually deserves all that happens to him. He actually makes it happen. You can't afford to be an introverted drama queen when your life is on the line with such a serious accusation as child abuse. I mean, to work with people and have a sense of empathy and to handle the problem the way he did...totally wrong. And you can't say he did not see it coming. But it is a movie, and I'm guessing the director thought ""Never mind logic and how a normal human being would have handled the situation, let us put on a show !"" I was cringing every time Lucas just stood and stared, avoided communication or threw a tantrum. I mean...how indifferent ( or overly confident ) to your own well being can you be to act so childish ? Of course people will understand you wrong. It made no sense. Never mind.",

348,8 December 2021,EdwardtheBlackPrince,7, Why don't you take a seat?,"The Hunt (Danish: Jagten) is a Danish drama directed by Thomas Vinterberg, and stars Mads Mikkelsen as Lucas an divorced father who works as a kindergarten teacher in a small town. Known and loved by everybody around his girlfriend, friends and their kids. Lucas finds himself under persecution when a little girl he's close to tells an adult that Lucas exposed his self to her. Soon the situation escalates and Lucas ends up becoming a pariah to the whole Town as he sees life shatter. This a film that deserve to be talked about, while obviously given the subject matter it's not going to grab everybody and many would prefer not to discuss such things. It reflects many real world situations and actions. That while everyday these things happen, they can sometimes not be what it seems. The films engaging and unnerving that does leave you conflicted. Here It pretty much states from the beginning that he's innocent, but the aftermath in the ""the hunt"" he endorse how quickly everything goes bad. Mads Mikkelsen is amazing here's a man who's roles are more often depicted as these imposing secretive bad guys. Here though he really sales the image of this broken average man who's has little left to hold on to. The scenes that really help makes his performance really stick is pretty much everything involving his son. It feels a really natural that the bond between them is strong. Though one thing worth noting that rather weird is that the mother is brought up through the entire film by everybody. You never once see this woman at all it's weird. While overall I felt the ending was a little unreal it still a good film. Kind of similar to another film called The Woodsman(2004) starring Kevin bacon. It is unconformable and is not going to appeal to everyone, but for the more curious viewer check it out.",

The first teacher takes the words of a 5 year old child as gospel, doesn't bother confronting Lucas or investigating. Clearly she's never met a child in her life before and is unaware children can make things up.
The child psychologist is laughable. No psychologist would put words in the child's mouth like that.
The girl tells her mum half way through that she lied and Lucas hasn't done anything...finally some escape from this nonsense....but the mum decides to tell her that no she actually was abused.

Every parent's fear is that there is a molester around the corner or in the house. Ever since Jon Binet, being around children is eerily uncomfortable. I personally am lucky to have no siblings or young people around me who have brats. I don't care for children. I'd have them raised on farms by strangers. I was one once. They are adults with more animal brains. They are just as conniving if not more so than adults, particularly kids who are privileged. Hetersexuals are always demonizing gays, priests, bachelor uncles to deflect what is really going on in a lot of their own homes--incest, the thing nobody wants to ever discuss. More men create harems for themselves and women create little slaves to do the bidding. Children are chattle but the pretense is love. This movie is wonderful because it puts a huge crack in the ancient dream of family. Enough with the lies. Let's be real. I loved/hated watching this film.

I am a great fan of Mads Mikkleson and watch his films and television work when I can find it. This film was excellent. I watched it as a horror film; uncomfortable, creepy, dark and scary. The character who made me feel most uncomfortable was Torsten who I feel is the real villain in this film. He allowed his sister to be subjected to pornography while his friend thought it was sooooo funny. Yes, peer pressure is a topic to discuss in his case, but really!! When he cried while watching Klara playing in the snow I thought his conscience is finally kicking in and he'll tell his parents about the pornography incident. Instead, he watches Marcus, Lucas and his parents continue to suffer. Torsten was not on the screen for a long period of time, but I think that during the time he was on he showed me enough to believe that he knew that what he did with his friend was the reason for his sister's trauma and the destruction of the life of his father's best friend.",

I loved Mads' acting (maybe his character was too calm, given the situation he found himself in), but this actor really surprised me. I already saw him portraying Hannibal Lecter in the new series, and in Casino Royale, and boy, was I wrong thinking he only could perfectly portray psycho and\or evil characters. The director\writer is fascinating in doing his job, so I decided to watch one of his previous works too, Festen. I'll do it soon, and I hope it delivers, just like this one. I loved how he chose not to explain WHY the little girl did what she did, but it was implied, just for us.

360,6 April 2014,arannya-monzur,10, A twenty-first century masterpiece,"Jagten - The Hunt is a film that stays with you, forces you to rethink your philosophy on life. The autumn wind guides a hunter's bullet into a grazing doe and we walk into a town where every Jack knows every Joe. Lucas is a divorced forty-something easing into his recent appointment as a kindergarten teacher. A strained relationship with his ex-wife deprives him of his son's company for most of the year and he broods over his loneliness in his big house. His best friend's daughter happens to be in his class. Her parents quarrel often and her teenage brother exposes her to pornography early. Lucas' warmth and friendliness wins her over and he becomes her first crush. She writes him a letter and leaves it in his coat with a toy heart. When she kisses a downed Lucas suddenly on the lips, he rebuffs her inappropriate behaviour - something that sets the stage for the major part of the film. Not taking the supposed rejection too well, she tells the school instructor(principal??) that she hates Lucas. When the (incredibly incompetent) woman wants to know more she tells her that Lucas has a stiff... (just watch the film) ... the old hag immediately jumps to the conclusion that Lucas has sexually abused her and more or less coerces the girl into telling everyone else so (even though she denies it at first). The child repeats it in the playground and in a case of mass hysteria, the other children begin claiming to have been abused as well. Lucas is fired from his job, ostracized from society, physically assaulted and has worse done on him. He variously loses (or rather, drives away) his girlfriend, his faithful companion and most of his friends. The only person who stands by him is his friend Bruun, also his son's godfather. But through it all, he holds on to his sense of self, finding comfort in the awareness of his own innocence. Eventually, contradictory testimonies exonerate him but it can not undo any of the damage inflicted on him. The emotions evoked in this act of The Hunt are probably the most realistic, most human ones ever put to film. It's just THAT damn good. He even has a Heisenberg moment in the local mall. The film closes one year later with almost the same scene it begins with. Lucas has been rehabilitated into society...or so it seems. He is last seen scoping out a doe like in the film's prologue...until a stray shot from the blue grazes his ear - a realization that things will never be the same again. Based on the true story of a child psychiatrist similarly accused in the late 90's. All in all, one of the greatest art films ever and a MUST- WATCH.

385,16 February 2022,Benslie,10, An underrated gem that should be on everybody's radars,"The biggest strength for this movie is the story. At first glance, this story just seems like a basic but messed up story of a man's life getting messed up by a child's lie and yes, that's what the movie mainly focuses on but there are some deeper elements to it as well. A deeper element to it is the whole mob mentality of the town and also how do we as a society figure out who is and isn't a criminal or in this case a pedophilia. I do wish though that the story did dive a bit more into the case a bit more and the investigation of all of this. Another fantastic element for this movie is that of the acting in it. Everybody in this movie gives it their all and it helps bring the audience along for this strange journey. The obvious stand-out performance in this movie is that of Mads Mikkelsen. He is the main character the audience follows throughout the movie and you see him have this slow descent to living a fully lonely life. But again, everybody in this movie does a great job of starting out one way and then transforming to another especially when you pay attention to the ending of the movie. The last thing I wanted to mention about this movie is the cinematography in it and how gorgeous it is. You can see how much detail went into each shot in order to help the audience best understand how serious this situation is. The same can be said for the mise en scene in this movie with how they place the actors and the lighting used in this movie to help get the point across. In the end, The Hunt is an underrated international movie that I highly recommend checking out whenever you can.",

I wanted to see especially Theo and his Wife apologize for not believing him etc... it annoyed me how he didn't put them in their place! But I guess that was the point.

Everyone who has a child knows that children lie all the time, but we cannot believe that a child could lie of being abused. Certainly in an age that the idea of ​​sexuality is not fully developed. Maybe in now days, children have more images about that but the idea of ​​a child who is willing to hurt someone no matter what, remains appalling. It is not the first time that en ""evil"" child come as an example, but in this case i would not say that Klara intended to do any harm. It is a kid like all the other kids and she is upset with her teacher. She tells a few lines from a porn movie she heard. The teacher is alarmed, but who wouldn't be? It is rather interesting that Klara knows the impact of her saying. She is innocent but not as much as someone might think. On the other hand, a man who is being wronged is struggling to prove his own innocence. It can happen and if so it would be like this.

437,26 August 2021,scocasso,8, Many People Believe That Such Cases Are Rare,"One of the first lessons I had about unfairness as a boy was being told that boys were not allowed to hit girls, under any circumstances, even if a girl hit me first, I was not allowed to hit them back. Of course the girls knew this 'rule' and used it to their advantage. They would hit a boy knowing full well that boys were not allowed to hit them back. If a boy hit them back anyway, they would run crying to an adult who would scold and punish the boy, but not the girl. Sometimes the girl would hit a boy, and the boy would become angry and go to hit her back, but she would run to the nearest adult for safety, sometimes pretending to cry and saying, ""He hit me!"" As the angry boy got angrier at her lies saying that he did nothing and that she was the one who hit him, the adult ignores this and scolds and punishes the boy, meanwhile the girl smiles and sticks out her tongue at the boy when the adult is not looking. Girls are innocent and girls don't lie and girls are to be believed. Girls learn this when they are very young. In this movie, the story could have been any one of these scenarios. The story could have been about one of these girls who grew up feeling quite free to use this tactic whenever it suited her, but when she reached her mid-teens, this tactic took a turn for the worse when she accused a boy of 'touching' her and was surprised when he was hauled away and taken to juvenile detention, AKA prison for the underaged. She wanted to take back what she said, she didn't want things to go this far, she only wanted to do as she always did, use her power to get the boy in trouble, just for fun, but everyone was pressuring her with their support. In this movie the girl is much younger and doesn't understand the consequences of her actions because she likely uses such innocent lies on other boys of her age to get them into trouble, but since this is an adult, things instantly become very serious and thrown straight into the adult world rather than the world of young children. It's a very good movie and emotionally taxing for those guys who have been through similar situations in real live or who have male friends who have, but very important for people to watch, especially those who always believe that the male is guilty and the female innocent in every circumstance.",

448,20 May 2016,johan-van-schaeren,9, great,"Like Festen, The Hunt (scripted by Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm) is set in idyllic rural Denmark, in a small tight-knit, lower middle-class community, rather than a hut-bourgeois family, but child abuse and the effect of its revelation is still the key issue. But in this case the alleged perpetrator is shown from the start to be innocent. In John Patrick Shanley's marvellous 2008 film Doubt, we are never absolutely certain whether Philip Seymour Hoffman's popular, humane New York priest is a paedophile or Meryl Streep's vindictive nun is merely motivated by envy. This creates suspense by inviting observers to examine the evidence drawn on by the accuser and the accused's defenders. Vinterberg eschews such ambiguity. His embattled hero, Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen), is a victim both of something awry in complacent Danish society (in this it resembles and echoes Michael Haneke's The White Ribbon) and the dangerous little lies told by an innocent child.",

Even though being longer than 1 hour and and a half, I feel like reading a short story. The line is pretty clear and the characters of features are very vivid. Actually, this is the first movie that I watched after transferring from the journalism department to the mathematics department. Highly recommend! The reason for Lucas being tortured by residents of their small town is Lucas's kindness. As his friend said, he tolerated too much. And thus, lost his dignity. Fortunately, he chose to fight for himself, and won it. This is a story of an ordinary person that reflects this person's greatness. The actors who play Lucas and Klara's father are awesome. Do not miss it. I feel like being vigorous again!",

Namely, a girl eagerly accuses her teacher of sexually abusing her. Only on the grounds that the girl said that, the teacher was exposed to the torture of the entire society. It is not my fault that on the basis of unproven ill-treatment, the entire knave of the story is set up so that someone is guilty in advance, although at the end of the film the truth has been clearly seen. Imagine someone says: You stole big money and on that basis you are on the pillar of the shame of the whole society, your life will be destroyed without any evidence. No proof of that.

And the way people treat him whilst the verdict is STILL not clear, would simply not happen in Denmark at this age and time. Come on, he's from a big, intelligent family with a good background and morals, not some basement creep. Everyone just came across unjust and idiotic.

The pace of the film is very, very slow. The actors do a good job interpreting several conditions of human nature, such as giving too much credence to what a little girl says without really verifying facts first. There are many situations that set the story up but aren't credible. There seems to have been a rush to set the stage. First we see this male teacher in is forties playing with kinder children. He has just divorced and is trying to mend fences with his son, who cannot see him as his mother won't let that happen. A little girl is shown a pornographic picture of an erect penis by her brother who also tells her a very graphic description of what's going on in the picture. Next thing, the girl makes, wraps and gives a gift to her male teacher and kisses him on the mouth while playing. The teacher tells her this isn't the right thing and next thing, the girls invents a story telling the principal that her teacher abused her. In the meantime, the teacher has no problem rebuilding his love life. In a matter-of-fact scene, a school colleague who is an immigrant (she isn't fluent in Danish but speaks good English) becomes his lover, you know, just like that. Love at first sight. The films progresses (slowly) showing several situations on how the school principal, the teacher's friends, the girl's parents, the community at large and the teacher himself, deal with this innuendo. The teacher is beaten several times by the town's men. It's curious that the town folk take the law in their own hands. There seems to be a police investigation under way but we never see it. Had it been part of the plot, the police investigators might have shown how the girl lied, how the principal of the school mismanaged the situation and would have put in jail several males in the community who attacked the teacher without really being involved in the problem and who didn't have the facts with them. But the director of the film chose not to include either the police investigation or a trial. This would have spoiled the story. There are two candidates that could have abused the girls: her older brother and her own father. Two scenes lead the viewer to consider that but there's no conclusion. A year after the event we see everybody celebrating the coming of age of the son of teacher in a party. The boy gets his first rifle and goes for his first hunt. His did is also hunting when someone fires a shot a him but misses. We see him on the ground looking at someone with a rifle, aiming at him. He can't see who that person is as the sun is behind him/her, and then this person leaves. ",

It was difficult for this movie to make sense and it become very annoying after awhile due to its nonsense. The lead actor did a good job playing his part, but storyline is nonsense.

The movie started out strong and promising and completely fell apart as soon as the actual plot was revealed.

The little girl even told her mom that he didn't do it and that she lied halfway through the film and she just told her that she was abused. All of the characters are insanely frustrating and unbelievable. At the end Lucas just ignores that people killed his dog, beat him and wouldn't serve him in a grocery store, and a grown man beat his son. Not to mention the whole town turned on him and accused him of sexual abuse with no evidence at all. I can't believe this movie is rated so high, it made me want pull my hair out. This movie is unbelievable, unrealistic, and this is not the way human beings act.",

528,8 December 2021,mlef-62911,9, ¿Que pasa cuando la opinión pública te ha condenado?,Excelente película sobre como a la hora de la verdad poco importa la llamada verdad judicial. Si tu comunidad ya te ha condenado tendrás que cumplir tu pena de una forma u otra. Excelente actuación del protagonista de Mads Mikelssen.,
529,25 February 2021,dartt-85886,7, Simple yet Effective,"Overall not a hugely subversive film in my opinion, but Mads performance is stellar and there were a few truely jaw-dropping moments. The film's style was quick paced and easy to digest, which lead to it seemingly glossing over serious issues that Lukas was dealing with. I worry that the message of the film may be misconstrued by some as an excuse to dismiss victims of SA, but i think a good balance was achieved between Luka's horror and the villagers well meaning (however misguided) attempts to protect a child.",
530,10 July 2021,frgonzalez-53515,7, Not a ten.,"The drama in this movie is wonderful. Maybe the same feeling u'll get with ""the joker"": sadness, discomfort and no sense of hope. However, it's no a ten. As close as it gets to reality, lacks a few simple but fundamental events on the development of the story. He never said what happened or even comment about the whole situation, I mean, are you really not going to consider, analyze or think about the exponential ""weird"" relationship with the young girl?. I see what the Director tried to stablish with the last scene, but is it really no hope at all for him? Don't think so.",
531,30 October 2021,yifeiyin,10, A great movie,"The most cruel thing about this movie is, if I lived in that town, I'm not sure if I would make the right choice. By the way, I do admire mads Mikkelsen's acting.",
532,18 February 2022,tima_kasumov,10, Tim Dalton,"The film smoothly balances between the present
and the past, revealing not only shocking
""skeletons from the closet"", but also the mores of the Average
The East, after all, originates from
the 70s. The film raises questions
of religion, morality, politics, retribution and
revenge, and of course maternal love. Such
a rattling cocktail that splashes out on
the viewer, with a shock denouement, that I personally,
for some time after watching, retreated and
could not recover.",
533,16 April 2022,olofberkelof,9, What would you do?,"There's nothing special about Lucas (the main character), these wrong accusations could be laid against anyone. I can't watch this movie without wandering what I would do in Lucas' situation. How could you prove your innocence if the daughter of your best friend starts telling people you've touched her?",
534,25 January 2023,mathd-78859,10, Blown away,"This movie is absolutely amazing. I had only heard good things about it, so i had high expectations.... And i was not just surprised i was blown away. It was amazing. Loved every second of it, had me on the edge of my seat through it all. The fewest movies has made me cry, but this was one of them. Amazing acting aswell. I dont know about watching it with subtitles and not knowing the language, but if you understand danish the script is so good (i think its very good with subtitles aswell, but not as good.) It will make you sad, and it will keep you interested. It will make you amazed and make you get even more into movies. One of the most underrated movies of all time, and probably the second best foreign film if not the best.",
535,1 May 2023,jczxpcyj,10, A film the challenges us all.,"I won't go into details of the performances displayed here. Suffice to say they're all superb. All I wanted to say after watching it, is I think this is one of the most important films to watch for our time. We all make almost instant judgements. Some of us, fortunately, have a degree of common sense and can apply it. But when the safety of our children are concerned, applying a rationale judgement is really hard. It falls to the authorities to ensure the rational side is explained. Needles to say that doesn't happen in the film. I don't know if we were meant to consider the real motivation behind the counsellor asking the type of questions he did to the girl. I found myself making my own judgement about him. And it was negative. Perhaps that is what was meant to happen.",
536,4 September 2021,barisbayram2045,10, Inspirational story with ethical implications against collective evil,"To avoid spoilers, I'll try articulating solely the main significance of the story, from my perspective: saying it as a practical matter, evil spreads in social networks so easily and increases exponentially through certain interactions (sort of tribalism) wherever we live. ""Jagten"" sincerely demonstrates why any problematic pattern of the banality of evil emerges and grows. Besides, the movie shows how one could ethically resist one's own unjust community when it comes to the realizations of their horrendous domination as a result of such a widespread evil despite violence and power asymmetry. Also, acting performances are so meaningful. And Mads, incredible! Entirely beautiful and hopeful film...",

539,17 June 2022,sinaGarizi,10, watch it,Watch this movie carefully and think about it deeply. Our acts can have lifelong effect on others; it is better to leave a good effect of ourselves than a bad one. It is about judging; one of the biggest problems of mankind from old times.,
