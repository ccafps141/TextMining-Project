0,23 March 2018,notoriousCASK,10, This Is the End...,"Apocalypse now is not only the best war film ever made but it's also one of the best films of all time as it won the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes and it's constantly recognized as a benchmark in cinematic history. Based on the novel ""Hearts of darkness"" by Joseph Conrad this film is not so much about the Vietnam war, it is about war in general and serves as a deep study into the dark places of the human soul and how war can affect the individual. Apocalypse now depicts a timeless story about a universal human struggle, the duality of man, consisting of morality, the savage primordial instinct and what every person chooses to base his actions upon.",/

2,22 January 2021,mark.waltz,10, The most anti-war pro-war film ever made.,"Coming out on the cusp of several other big award winning Vietnam war films (""Coming Home"" and ""The Deer Hunter"" which could not have been any more different), this is the most avant garde of them all. While another stack of Vietnam war films came out nearly a decade later, this is perhaps the most controversial. Unlike his son Charlie Sheen's character in ""Platoon"" Martin Sheen's captain here isn't just a recruit facing his own apocalypse from going into combat for the first time. He's experienced, trusted and smart, and that's just one of the reasons he's chosen for the special mission of going deep into the Vietnam jungle to take out one of his own, an American officer who seems to have defected, declared himself to be lord of that jungle and most likely incurably insane.",e
3,11 December 2008,Nazi_Fighter_David,9, Coppola conveyed the drama and spectacle of this truly outstanding film,"After the success of the first two 'Godfather' films in 1972 and 1974 respectively, Francis Ford Coppola embarked on an ambitious attempt to bring home the reality of the war in Vietnam, which had concluded with the fall of Saigon to the Vietcong in 1975 The plot was loosely based on the book 'Heart of Darkness,' a story by Joseph Conrad about Kurtz, a trading company agent in the African jungle who has acquired mysterious powers over the nativesCoppola retains much of this, including such details as the severed heads outside Kurtz's headquarters and his final words, ""The horror the horror"" ",v
4,12 February 2007,Hitchcoc,9, Take the long ride to perdition.,"There are films we watch because they are good, even though they are painful for us. This is a film I saw one time. At that time I thought to myself, this is enough. It was painful to make that journey down the river, wondering what was around every corner. Then we meet the products of our own id impulses, as we are the enemy, our souls have been brought down to this. At the end of the river is the man who came before us, and we see the uselessness of the journey. It is the Heart of Darkness. There are death masters like Robert Duvall. There are those who can only hope to survive, but the war is the master. The Doors music as the napalm settles gently on the treetops and across the ground, sweeps us up gently. Meanwhile it is consuming the flesh of the Vietnamese people, as well as an occasional American soldier. The ancient Romans could not envision peace without war. We and much of the world seem to have embraced those tenets put forth some two thousand years ago. This film gets into the marrow.",i

6,21 December 2004,jokeco68,10," In my opinion, Coppola's best work","My favourite movie of all time. This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making 'the Godfather' and 'GodfatherII' and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like 'Apocalypse Now'. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz's compound. And just like Willard, he DIDN'T know what he was going to do once he got there. This is such a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it offers no answers or conclusions. Consequently, because of this open-endedness, it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious. ",w
7,6 January 2000,Quinoa1984,10, In my top five favorite films ever made,"Apocalypse Now is not only my personal favorite work by Francis Ford Coppolla, it's also one of the great visions ever put onto cinema. It makes what was horrific, strange, and ironically exciting and mysterious about the Vietnam War into this mad tale of obsession, death, loss, and the dark side of humanity. While the stories behind the production of the film made it notorious and rather risky back in 1979, it works on its own terms and represents not just Coppola's genius but others in the Zoetrope team as well. It also paints a sometimes lurid, ultra-violent, bleak and curious view of what war does to people, both in the lower ranks, the big-guns, and those who go too far ""up the river"".",/
8,4 October 2004,FilmOtaku,8, The horror. The horror,"'Apocalypse Now Redux', Francis Ford Coppola's war opus is probably the most beautiful war film I have ever seen. Capt. Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is a Vietnam soldier who is tapped to head a very dangerous and highly classified mission into Cambodia to 'terminate the position' of Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a highly ranked and highly regarded army man who seemingly has gone completely insane and defected from the army, setting up his own little society and helped by a cultish following of soldiers. Escorting him up the river to Cambodia is a handful of navy men, and along the way, they encounter several interesting people (most notably is Robert Duvall's Kilgore, a badass lieutenant colonel with a few screws loose) and some horrifying situations.

15,18 October 2011,planktonrules,9," As long as you realize it's FICTION, you're okay...","My biggest complaint about ""Apocalypse Now"" is that many who view it might think this is exactly like the Vietnam War. Instead, it's almost like a non-funny spoof--satirizing it instead of showing an actual view of the war. The film shoves a decade of surreal incidents and some completely fictional ones along with incorporating Joseph Conrad's book ""Heat of Darkness"" and the Herzog film ""Aguirre: The Wrath of God"" into this vision. The results are pretty amazing...just NOT the actual Vietnam War. In other words, there was too much craziness for one movie--but it did make for exciting and compelling viewing nevertheless.",8

21,19 January 2009,classicalsteve,10," Incredible Adaption of Conrad's ""The Heart of Darkness"" -- Possibly Coppola's Masterpiece","Movies seem to fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing societal values and beliefs, and those that challenge them. This film is a 180-degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in offerings like ""The Longest Day"" and ""The Green Berets"" which seem more like Disney fantasies by comparison. The ""Apocalypse Now!"" project, the production and resulting film, is ""Heart of Darkness"" updated into a psychological horror story of the late 20th century post-modernist variety. The cast and crew who worked on it probably could relate to the terrifying places the human mind can achieve. This is the plight of Joseph Conrad's original character Kurtz who came into literary being in 1901 and subsequently referenced in TS Eliot's ""The Hollow Men"" (Mistah Kurtz, he dead) of 1925. Although neither a straight telling of Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" (1901) nor a first-hand account of the Vietnam experience, ""Apocalypse Now!"" stands as a masterpiece which pushed on the envelope of cinematic potential. ""Apocalypse"" is not just about the ""horrors"" of war per se, like ""Platoon"" and ""The Deer Hunter"", but the darker sensibilities of human nature as revealed through the raw and demeaning confrontations of violent conflict on a mass scale. Apocalypse Now! is not so much seen as experienced.",f

24,24 February 2015,Horst_In_Translation,6, More of an experience than a movie,"""Apocalypse Now"" is a 1979 movie by Francis Ford Coppola. 7 years after ""The Godfather"", he reunites with actor Marlon Brando (fat and bald here in his mid-50s), who is really difficult to recognize. He plays a highly decorated soldier, who deserted in Cambodia. However, I felt his part was just too self-indulging. It had ""Give me an Oscar"" written all over it as the final 45 minutes of the film entirely circled around him and everything before as well as he was talked about for pretty much the entire film. However, Brando did not win a single award anywhere for his performance here and the film won Oscars for its cinematography and sound. With the truly big awards, the Academy preferred a family divorce drama that year. The central character in ""Apocalypse Now"", however, is played by Martin Sheen, who shows striking resemblance to his son Charlie in quite a few scenes.",t
25,2 September 2005,GOPC,10, Apocalypse Now Redux ought to be treated separately here,"As I stated above, I think that the 2000 version of the film ought to be treated separately. The Redux is not just a longer version. It contains two new and important scenes, and one of them, the ""french"" episode, adds a whole new touch to a classic movie, WITHOUT breaking the atmosphere or disturbing the overall picture. I remember as I saw the Redux for the first time, that my whole understanding of the war in Vietnam changed, and how I had to go to the library and get an update on a few things. Also it is interesting that Coppola chose the year 2000 for the longer Redux. My guess is that he feels that the movie is as important today as it was back in 1979. He even went to the trouble of making an excellent piece of art even better, in order to actually make all the old fans see the new stuff, and to present a whole new generation with a very controversial and strong comment on one of the most bloody wars in recorded history. The movie is thought-provoking indeed, but also it has a visually very beautifully composed screenplay. Capturing the madness and chaos of war the storyline is also filled with more or less obvious metaphors and philosophical or existential riddles. A friend of mine called it ""the most philosophical of all movies"" - perhaps an overstatement - in my opinion it is just a very good film about war and the politics of war. But I can see that there is plenty for everyone here. What I'm saying is that it's one of those movies that you are likely to hear distinctly different opinions about, and you are most probably going to think again and again about it. I've seen the Redux 5, 6 or 7 times, and it is always a puzzling experience. Highly recommended.",t
26,12 January 2005,jande9,10, One of the best and most important movies ever,"This movie changed the art of film making, telling a complex story in a powerful new way. The film mixes brutal realism with fantasy, intercutting a modern war with strange scenes full of technicolour smoke. The film uses music not as a score laid in later, but as a practical part of the scene playing from speakers, radios etc. Coppola uses a classic piece of literature as inspiration, taking scenes and characters, and putting them into entirely different surroundings. That is a tricky and brave thing to do. Then he takes a superstar, Brando, pays him a fortune, and films him so that you can barely see his face. The pure guts that such a move requires is astounding, and it works beautifully. This movie belongs in the top ten.",_

28,23 June 2017,draney-600-338393,5, I must be missing something...,"Now, it would appear by judging the user and critic reviews that my opinion is in the minority. Nonetheless, I cannot for the life of me understand the extremely high ratings for this film. The Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon and Good Morning Vietnam all much more enjoyable. The cinematography of Apocalypse Now is very good at times, the opening scene being arguably my favourite part of the film as the music is perfect. However throughout the whole film I just felt an extreme lack of consistency with the storyline, too much confusion and jolting between themes. Whilst some of the action scenes were brilliant, I just felt a real lack of connection to the purpose. Now I won't spoil the ending but let's just say I really could not make heads or tail of the decisions made, all logic was out of the window. I am never usually critical of a film and this must be the highest rated picture that I really do not get on well with, for some reason I just expected a lot more and was very disappointed.",r
29,25 June 2001,Cinema_Hound,10," You love it, or you hate it....","As I peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the IMDB have posted on this film, I find it very interesting how few ,""middle of the road"" comments there are. Everyone either loves it, or they hate it. Having seen Apocalypse Now approximately 30 times, and having recently dissected it on DVD (how did we ever live without those magical digital machines?????), I can say without hesitation that I am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film. ""Why would you like a film that's so confusing?"" ask many of my associates. The answer is this: Forget the war, forget the brutality....This is a classic story of society protecting itself from those that refuse to fall in line with the status quo. Brando represents the individual that has his own way of getting the job done. They (Big Brother) sent him out to do the job, he does it too well, without adhering to the accepted ""standards"" of death and destruction (Am I the only one who's troubled by the fact that we have 'standards' for death and destruction????), so they send the ""Conformity Police"" out to eliminate the individual. Hmmmmmm....Draw any parallels between this and things you see every day? With the deepest respect to Mr. Coppola, whom I believe is one of the best directors of all time, I think he transcended his original intent of the movie, and probably didn't even realize it until after the movie was released. The subtle sub-text that permeates the entire movie has way too much to it to have been planned and portrayed; instead, it seems to have 'grown' itself, like some wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden. Again I must reiterate: I think FF Coppola did a bang-up job on this entire production, as did the cast and crew, but the sum of the movie exceeds the individual efforts ten-fold. So if you haven't seen the movie, rent it, watch it, then watch it again, and maybe a few more times, and look for all the generic parallels to everyday life. Only then make a judgment on the quality of the film. Those of you that have seen it, watch it again with the mindset previously described. I think you may just have a whole new appreciation for the film. Or maybe not! No matter whether you love it or hate it, be sure and give credit to Coppola for his masterful story-telling style!",v

43,1 December 1999,Don-102,10, Possibly the most ambitious film ever made...,"Francis Coppola's descent into madness back in the late 1970's was all about APOCALYPSE NOW, one of the most incredible pieces of art ever placed on the screen.  It is violent, beautiful, ugly, and damn dark at times.  As a war film, APOCALYPSE NOW does not move me anywhere near the way PLATOON and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did.  Those two pictures deal with war in a more combative, realistic way.  You grow and bond with the troupes in those flicks.  Here, you are engulfed in complete madness, something that seems apart from actual war.  It is more of a morality play into the soul and our ""hearts of darkness"" than a war film.",

45,19 February 2022,brianberta,9, One of the best war films ever made.,"I watched the Redux version several years ago and, while I loved certain parts of it, it dragged for me in some other scenes and I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped I would. Since I hadn't seen the theatrical version prior to this Hall, I was curious as to how well I would respond to it. I expected for it to be an easier watch than the Redux version, but what I wasn't expecting was for it to trump my own expectations. To get it out of the way, yes, the animal cruelty scenes (the water buffalo being killed and the rough handling of the dog) are hard to watch and indefensible, but other than that, this film is truly excellent and is quite possibly the best representation of a descent into madness I've ever seen. I've seen many critics argue that the journey to Kurtz's compound is a metaphorical descent into madness and that was what stood out the most to me while watching this film. The first stop with Lt. Col. Kilgore shows the first stage of this descent. On the surface, it's a fairly conventional raid scene (albeit one which is technically outstanding), but that Kilgore orders some soldiers to surf during the raid and expresses his gratitude towards a Vietnamese soldier who fought in spite of being seriously wounded adds an undercurrent of surrealism to to that sequence. The second stop where hundreds of soldiers watch a Playboy show at a supply depot shows the next stage of this descent. Many soldiers in that scene yell sexual remarks at the women and try to rush the stage, showing more of their unhinged behavior. The third main stop at a remote U. S. army outpost expands on this descent. Several soldiers seem desperate to get into their boat in an attempt to return home and the other soldiers in the outpost seem to have no idea who their commanding officer is. There doesn't seem to be much order in that outpost and the whole scene maintains a hellish atmosphere. And, of course, Kurtz's compound is the final stage of this descent. I love how his monologues in that scene feel simultaneously avant-garde and narrative-driven at the same time. Though Kurtz appears to be talking about great insights in his speeches, half of what he says doesn't make any sense. Topped with how his face is either partially or entirely obscured in darkness throughout those scenes makes them some of the best movie monologues I've ever seen. Topped with some excellent cinematography and some outstanding soundtrack choices (Ride of the Valkyries and The End), this film is definitely a top 10 war film for me.",

47,2 August 2021,briancham1994,7, Atmospheric yet aimless,"I watched the Redux version of this film, which has a notoriously bloated runtime and a lack of pacing. This is apparent from the start of the film as banal scenes drag on without much of a sense of importance. The film only picks up as we encounter a disaffected colonel who is only interested in surfing, an iconic scene that shows off all the rogue personalities involved. This motley crew of incompetent, apathetic and impulsive soldiers head off on an ill defined path to wreak havoc and expose the futility of the American war effort. This thematic concern wears itself thin and becomes totally devoid of substance as soon as Kurtz is discovered. Despite its dark and symbolic content, the film appears to have nothing to offer beyond that point, meandering about with no resolution.",

52,17 December 2014,videorama-759-859391,9, Atmospheric and unforgettably brilliant war film,"Here's that offbeat Vietnam Coppola masterpiece, with the whop whop whopping sound of choppers cutting the air. Unlike a few Vietnam films, this one is plot driven, and I must say, the story is an original. It's the journey there that makes the film, as well as the fantastic performances, all round, notably Sheen and wildcat Frederick Forrest, although of course it's Duvall as the gung ho Lieutenant, spouting that film's famous line, who steals their thunder, before a couple of bombings happen behind him, where he hardly flinches. Is this guy invincible or what? It's the most memorable part of the film. Sheen plays a Colonel, who's been to Vietnam and back, where he's back in Vietnam, positioned at Saigon. He's summoned on a mission, to find an outstanding Colonel, Kurtz (Brando, giving us an enigmatic character in an unbelievably masterful piece of acting) and terminate (kill) him. Sheen must travel up the river, of course, through the likelihoods of attacks. It's the first Vietnam film I've seen, that features soldier surfing. Did they really do this? It seems surreal, but as a Vietnam pic, it's very real. Hopper, a bloody unappreciated actor, so much so, it's criminal, is unforgettably brilliant as Brando's master and protector who gives us that wonderful monologue, while talking to a caged Sheen, where it's fates being decided. The script is top notch. If ever getting a chance, read itr, it's brilliant. Sheen's tired, wearied voice so much suits the role, from which Harvey Keitel, was originally cast, but just wasn't delivering the goods. Even great actors have their flaws, as even I was dropped from a short movie once. The playboy bunnies that came to visit the troops, via helicopter of course (check out one of Frederick Forest's requests) is beautifully shot. As for the Redux I prefer the original, as it did stall the story, as with the French family, the movie didn't benefit from it all, as this bit, didn't maintain interest, and wasn't warranted. We as an audience, didn't really need to be informed about this. As for gore, it's very restrained, only occasional, but there is that sick, and little disturbing scene near the end, involving a goat being sliced up. Forever a Vietnam masterpiece, AN is an ambitious and larger than life Vietnam film, crafted by a masterful director, whose got unforgettable performances out of his actors, in a brilliant choice of casting. But AN is brilliant, in about everything. What's also unforgettable is the state of that shrimp, before Willard treks off on his mission, to terminate a man, who's mind has flipped one too many switches. Willard does have the choice of roast beef too.",
53,27 January 2009,thinker1691,8," "" You Need to assassinate this man as he is winning a war, we promised we wouldn't win ""","Americans have always won wars which involved great patriotism. World War I and II were global and fought in conjunction with our allies and were eventually brought to successful conclusions. After that, American wars were not successful as the goals and their ultimate purposes were hazy at best. The Viet-Nam war was a case in point. As the film ""Apocalypse Now"" tells it, a 'special opts' soldier, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is selected to travel up-country in Viet-Nam to assassinate or as they put it, 'terminate' the command of Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando) as he is doing something which the pentagon officials have promised the politicians they would not do. This determined American individual is winning the war and doing it with such field tactics and savage methods which in their mind boarder on the criminal. Williard is torn between admiration for his target and conviction for his mission. Along the way, the Captain sees just how insane the Viet-Nam war really is. One commander he meets Lt. Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall) borders on sheer lunacy with statements such as "" I love the smell of Napalm in the morning."" Another individual he meets is a photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) so impressed with Kurtz' ability to win the war, believes him to be not only mystical, but divine. The story is loosely based on Joseph Conrad's book 'Heart of Darkness' where the hero is sent not to kill him, but to save him. However in this adaptation Willard the assassin, who mimicking robot-like soldiers will follow orders regardless how insane those orders are. The great cast includes Frederic Forrest, Sam Bottoms, Laurence Fishburne, Harrison Ford and Scott Glenn as Lieutenant Colby make this film one of the truly memorable pictures of our time. Winning so many awards, its difficult to tell which aspect of the movie helped make this story a Classic. ****",

60,16 July 2021,nickenchuggets,10," My only friend, the end","Every once in a while, a movie comes around that is so huge and influential, it revolutionizes a genre and sets the standard for years to come. Apocalypse now is one such movie, and is set in what is considered by many to be the most divisive and shameful period in American history: the Vietnam war. Directed by the genius Francis Coppola, and featuring an impressive lineup of actors, such as Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper, there is no way this movie can't be considered one of the best. What sets it apart from other war movies is its very strange and mysterious atmosphere. Even the characters in the film don't seem to be positive what the war in vietnam is about. US soldiers are made to set fire to civilian houses just because they're hoarding food for the Vietcong, and many men are killed by traps that they can't even see. All of this, combined with the fact that the american public back home was strongly opposed to what they considered an immoral war contributed to the disdain many americans have for this time period. By 1975, over 50 thousand americans would be dead, south vietnam became communist, and america was forced to withdraw in a humiliating retreat seen by the entire world. So the question remains: how well does Apocalypse now depict the futility of fighting a war against a guerilla enemy in a humid and inhospitable jungle landscape? The movie begins by telling us the vietnamese aren't the only faction using guerilla hit-and-run tactics in southeast asia at this time. US Army Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando) has been engaged in a bitter guerilla war against north vietnamese and vietcong forces without the permission of the US government. His headquarters is located in Cambodia, the country to the west of south vietnam. Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is part of the MACV-SOG organization, which specializes in unconventional guerilla warfare. His job is all about speed, aggression, and hitting your enemies from where they're not expecting. He is called upon by the Central Intelligence Agency to find Kurtz and do whatever it takes to kill him. Willard then sets off on a wild, twisting chase in a patrol boat with some other officers and soldiers, trying to find where in the world Kurtz could be. On the way, he comes across some UH-1 Iroquois attack helicopters that attack vietnamese positions while blasting Ride of the Valkyries on their stereos. Later on, Willard finds out that Kurtz, for some reason, decided to leave the Pentagon and join a special operations group to fight the vietcong and NVA, which means he won't ever get promoted to General (colonel being the highest rank before the general ranks). Eventually, Willard's team makes its way to the cambodian temple where Kurtz is stationed, and it is surely a horrible looking place. Dead bodies and human skin are on display everywhere, seemingly in an attempt to scare away outsiders. Willard comes face to face with Kurtz, and Kurtz kills one of Willard's men because he planned to destroy the temple. Willard finally accomplishes his mission and kills Kurtz with a broad bladed knife, and the temple goes up in flames after some bombers turn the area into a moonscape. I don't think anyone would deny, this is a huge movie. It's really long, and there's even more than one version which can add to the confusion for some people looking to watch it. The one I've seen is the redux version, which adds in about 40 minutes worth of stuff that was cut from the original, including a scene that involves Willard talking to a french family who own a plantation (france used to own what is now vietnam.) This scene is widely considered boring, harmful to the pacing of the movie, and unnecessary, but its important to understand the backstory of the vietnam war if you want the complete picture. The casting here is all great; Brando, though hardly seen until the last few scenes, is arguably the real main character of this movie. After all, he's the reason why Willard must journey into cambodia in the first place. Kurtz is ruthless in war, but at the same time he shows a respect for the vietcong's ability to enter hidden tunnels, reemerge half a mile away, and kill americans with a single shot. Not everything he says makes a lot of sense however. Martin Sheen plays Captain Willard, who is the officer leading the team responsible for killing Kurtz. He's a good enough commander, but his team starts to become disillusioned with him after a while, and most americans didn't even want to fight in vietnam anyway. I think we can all agree that the helicopter scene is definitely among the best things ever put in a movie. Helicopters were everything in vietnam: if you were wounded, one took you out, and if you needed ammo, one brought some in. The airborne raid on the VC perfectly encapsulates this new type of warfare that was used for the first time in vietnam. To make a (very) long story short, Apocalypse Now is an enormous movie, and Coppola actually almost committed suicide while making it because it was so much work, but his persistence did pay off. When you have an interesting story combined with good characters, you get a masterpiece.",

66,4 July 2004,cristiangrecu,10, Truly a Masterpiece,"Somewhere on IMDb there is a discussion about the greatest director of all times (Spielberg, Copolla and others are named there). The greatest argument was around Spielberg and whether he is or isn't a great director. The problem with Spielberg is that while he is a master technician, most of his films lack depth.Saving Ryan is really outstanding from a technical point of view, but its message is dull and while its very entertaining, it doesn't make you think about anything. AN is the best movie I ever saw because it combines great shooting with a deep philosophical perspective on so many things, starting from war in general, the clash of civilizations, the condition of soldier in wartimes (is a soldier a hero or an assassin? Brando says he is neither, the french lady says he is both ...) and many others. The problem with some people is that they try to argue about whether these points are true or false. But a great movie, and a great piece of art in general is supposed to spark arguments, not to solve them ... Maybe Coppola is right, or maybe he isn't, nobody holds the truth anyway. You can watch this movie for its outer beauty, amazing scenes, great acting and memorable quotes and you will be entirely satisfied. But what really make this movie a masterpiece is its inner quality. You can't help but make a comparison with the recent Fahrenheit documentary.Both Copolla and Moore tackle similar issues, but while Copolla presents matters from an outside , objective point of view, Moore takes a very partisan position that really compromises the whole point of a documentary ... It is really a shame that a film like Fahrenheit 9/11 won a prestigious award like Cannes. But anyway, if you want to start to understand a little of the Vietnam war, the Iraq war, the second World War and any war in general, you should definitely see this movie, and not the other one ...",

76,16 December 2019,RatedVforVinny,10, Seriously pretentious yet essential viewing.,"The only movie in film history to be both pretentious yet utterly essential. The helicopter raid (which is the movies standout scene) on an ill-fated Vietnamese village, is simply mind-blowing and one of the finest action sequences ever committed to the screen. Francis Ford Coppola was wise to stick with such quality actors, he'd previously used in both 'The Godfather' and 'The Conversation', chiefly Robert Duvall as the crazy, Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore (of the Air Cavalry), Marlon Brando (as the hunted Kurtz) and Gene Hackman (in a lessor role). 'Apocalypse Now' is not just about the horror of war (though it naturally depicts this in large doses) but also deals with the mayhem and absolute chaos that was Vietnam. This anti-war classic has never really dated like other, latter 'Nam' movies such as 'Platoon' and to be honest it's impossible to imagine a film of such magnitude, cost and physical endurance ever being produced in today's climate (in fact it would be nigh on impossible). The psychedelic soundtrack (including music) by 'The Doors', together with some brilliant method acting by Martin sheen (as the man with a mission) and some rather intense improvisation by madcap Denis Hopper (as a rogue photo journalist), make it seem like one bad but beautiful acid trip. The way longer 'Redux' release, with previously deleted scenes, slows the pace but is still an interesting watch and a huge must for the fans; so basically you will need to own both versions.",

80,2 September 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,9, Hard to sit through and not terribly good ending,"The only two problems with this movie are, as the one line summary states, the length and the ending. It's so long that unless you're very determined or very patient, you're not gonna sit through it to the end(particularly not if you're watching the ""redux"" version which I was(un?)lucky enough to see on TV). And the ending seems to suggest that Coppola had either run out of steam or simply didn't know how he should end it. As a war film, it's not particularly realistic, I guess, but more of a piece about the descent into madness that you experience under such dehumanizing circumstances. I found it interesting to see as such a film, but arguably not much else... I also found it interesting to recognize the actors, whom I, for the most part, hadn't seen in a film from, at least before the 80's. If any of this doesn't make sense, don't blame me... blame the fact that I'm writing this as I'm almost falling asleep after the movie. Now, let it be known, that I didn't pay attention to the entire thing; I am neither a man of great patience nor determination(well, not enough, anyway) so I fell asleep once or twice through this film, and actually found myself awaking a few minutes after it had ended, and had to rewind it to catch the ending. Maybe that affected my judgment, maybe not(it probably did). However, what I saw, I mostly liked. The acting is very good. The characters are well-written and nuanced. The action is well-done. The cinematography is very good. All in all, a very good film, if you have the patience and you're sufficiently interested in seeing this very well done piece of film, despite it's very long runtime(maybe you would want to start with the original version, not the ""redux"" one I saw).

81,7 February 2020,Offworld_Colony,10, Watching this new transfer and cut of Apocalypse at BFI's IMAX was like watching it for the first time;,"It was surprising, shocking, frightening and hypnotic; I was amazed that the film played out completely different to how I remembered it. It really is a masterclass on delivering something esoteric and meaningful and really the quintessential (as it should be) journey into the Heat of Darkness, and yet also still utterly and completely a movie, and not an experiment or a passion piece so awkward as to not be able to enjoy it just as a movie. It strikes a perfect equilibrium and harmony with its message, cultural zeitgeist, its creators (Milius and Coppola), and its inspired material.
Regarding the image, it's mind-blowing, the rich colour-timing pops and yet is seamless, and the quality of the image is used to tremendous effect on those close-ups, where the actors are looking right into you.
Regarding the cut itself I almost knocked half a star off for the plantation scene; a scene that is fine on home video, but on the silver screen breaks the pace; stalling the way on to the ending, it provides commentary to something best left to stings of dialogue and visuals and editing instead of table scenes, and then culminates with a cringe-inducing score while Willard is seduced by the French Woman. A brief dinner scene showing the generational opinions and then the opium scene would have still held the essence instead of feeling completely out of place. There's also a palpable smidge too much of Duvall.
Watching it this time, the sound effects were so ahead of their time, they are perfect, and I've never really heard the score for this movie before, this time I thought it was sumptuous; a mix of dreamlike and grounded, somewhere else; modern and timeless.
There was a pre-filmed QnA afterwards with Soderbergh which was nice to watch, but alerted me to the excellent and enlightening Coppola/Miulius 2008 interview that can now be found on YouTube which made me appreciate the collaboration and humility of the filmmakers even more.
Apocalypse is unique, it's perfect, it's powerful and important in both the human heart and cinema. It's a masterclass and the scope, amount of extras, breadth of sets, intensity of the realism; of it all speaks to a bygone era in a powerful way; the way helicopters land so close to us in a way they never could now without CGI, the destruction that connects us to the destruction of the American machine during Vietnam, it's out of this world.",

For a generation of movie watchers born after the Viet Nam era, scenes like those might seem like the fevered nightmares of a troubled film maker, but for those who lived it, they were all too real.

Martin Sheen plays an Army Captain who's been traumatized by his first tour of duty in Saigon; but, left without a family and haunted by memories of the jungles, he is almost anxious to accept a new mission: track down and kill a renegade Green Beret Colonel, a poetic martinet who has apparently lost his mind and is hiding out in the ""heart of darkness"". Elephantine production quickly gets out of hand, and Sheen seems to struggle with his wobbly, mushy character (he's rudderless throughout, acting mostly with his wide eyes). The locations and the rock music selections are impeccable, stamping the film with a distinctive (and artistic) mark, but Coppola loses his identity somewhere along this unseemly journey. ""Apocalypse Now"" has the look of genius, yet it could be a picture directed by any number of brazen auteurs. Some incredible supporting performances--including by Marlon Brando, as well as Robert Duvall, Sam Bottoms, Dennis Hopper (who just evaporates) and Frederic Forrest--give the proceedings some muscle, but it's a wayward and occasionally woebegone picture, a war film that throws its punches in the dark like a blindfolded boxer. **1/2 from ****",

Robert Duvall was probably my favorite character even though he was only in it for a smidge. I couldn't believe Laurence Fishburne was only 14 when he was in this, he looked a lot older. Martin Sheen was spectacular and believe it or not I think he did a better job than Harvey Keitel would've in this role (even though I'm one of his major fans), so when he dropped out I don't consider that to be a tragedy by any means.

108,1 August 2005,barnabyrudge,10," A hugely important and hypnotic film, like a compelling nightmare from which you cannot awaken.","Apocalypse Now is a stunning film on many levels, and a film that reverberates long after the viewer has come away from it. Visually remarkable, thematically frightening, filled with haunting and dream-like sequences that show the horror and insanity of war in intense detail, it is a film that can be watched and re-watched endlessly without ever failing to throw up new surprises. It was greeted with huge controversy when released in 1979, and almost thirty years on remains as powerful an experience. One thing that has altered over the years is the critical reaction to Marlon Brando's performance as the renegade Colonel Kurtz. Initially, Brando's performance was heavily criticised for being impenetrable and inscrutable (it didn't help that he arrived on set overweight and unprepared), but over the years the cleverness of his interpretation of Kurtz has become more apparent. Kurtz is a man alternately psychotic and eccentric, and always dangerous, and in retrospect Brando's bizarre approach to the role captures the character's insanity quite ingeniously. Those who complain they cannot understand what Kurtz is talking about in the film's final scenes are missing the point - he is lost in his own phantasmagoria and we are not meant to understand his demented ramblings.",

110,2 July 2006,EdgarST,10, Coppola's Masterpiece,"Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece was a great ending for a golden decade of American cinema. In the 1970s there was an atmosphere of tolerance, open-mindness, and progressiveness among the studios that allowed the making of major films by a few of the best directors that the United States has ever had. I am not a historian, but all the events that preceded the decade (a few being the violent deaths of major figures of the American political and cultural scenes, the racial struggles, the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture, the increase of violence and death in the streets...) seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who were willing to dare, be different, and create entertaining and intelligent motion pictures. Coppola's film is a strange blend of humanistic thinking and skillful film-making, following the parameters of war and adventure films, and at the same time subverting them with its flowing reflections on the value of life, the reason of death, or the ethics of war. It is also a passionate work, made against all odds, chronicled in the 1991 documentary ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse""; a motion picture that went beyond any previous reflection on the Vietnam war ever to reach the screen. This may not be the definite Vietnam motion picture, but dealing with it Coppola defied the formula of classic melodrama found in two Vietnam movies made simultaneously, ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Coming Home"", or in latter ones as ""Platoon"" and ""Casualties of War"", before Vietnam became the starting point to make products of any genre, as horror in ""Jacob's Ladder"", or comedies as ""Good Morning, Vietnam"", among the more respectable. Coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the background of a search for answers to questions faced by any man every day of his life, without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war.",

116,13 May 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," A beast of a film built upon spectacular spectacle and practically seeping with blood, sweat and tears.","'Apocalypse Now (1979)' is a beast of a film. It's an odyssey unlike any other, one that's just as interesting and tumultuous behind-the-scenes as on the screen, and you can almost feel the blood, sweat and tears dripping from every frame, with our protagonist's sanity coming only as close to breaking as Coppola's must have been. The result of the entire ordeal is an experience that's difficult to describe. It has an impact but also lacks a certain something, that intangible connection, that would really make it 'pop', so to speak. It's much easier to appreciate from a technical stand-point than it is from a narrative, as the latter is loose and unfocused while also lacking a real resolution. It may be the lax structure, which doesn't place all that much outward emphasis on character growth or 'plot-points', that leads the ending to feel less like a completion of an arc and more like the fulfilment of an inevitability. Still, there is a compelling exploration of theme occurring here. The way the piece uses its central conflict of Willard and Kurtz, who aren't really at odds but are simply told to be 'enemies', as a way of exploring the wider conflict is subtle but inspired. The story is a very personal one, but moments of Vietnam War examination and commentary seep into the narrative in interesting and unconventional ways. It's these moments that work perhaps the best, with the genuine spectacle combining with the horrors of war to make a comment on the 'validity' of - or Coppola's general feeling towards - the whole situation. When the piece slows down, however, the contemplative tone and harsh, hard-boiled narration can't always keep up with the expectations that have been previously set by vivid montages and brilliant practicality. There is a palpable dread that builds up as we float along the river, though, and eking out the meeting of our hero and his supposed foe is a wise move. When they do meet, their clash is marred slightly by Brando's ill-prepared performance which, while occasionally commanding, is generally not up to par and doesn't meet the admittedly elusive standards set by all the flick's foreshadowing. There's also a sour note when the real slaughter of a water buffalo comes into play, something which Copolla has since tried to downplay. This is an uncomfortable moment that is unfortunately extended and interwoven with a key scene, making for a cringe-inducing finale that honestly plays in pretty poor-taste - even if the contrasting symbolism of the two in-universe events works well. Overall, the film is an engaging and strangely hypnotic one that works when it works but does suffer from slow segments and some areas of discomfort. It is built upon spectacular spectacle and clearly took a lot of time, effort and talent to make. 7/10",

Martin Sheen and crew of small PBR gunboat are sent deep (and I mean DEEP) into the unclaimed jungle to terminate renegade U.S. Army officer Brando. With each mile they travel civilization moves further and further away. Surrealistic film style captures perfectly what must have been the hell of Vietnam in-country (or any other kind of) service. Duvall is memorable as arrogant air cav officer obsessed with surfing even in the midst of bloody shore assault. Sheen (who I think suffered a heart attack during the filming) is Oscar-caliber as an ordinary guy just trying to do his damn job in the midst of bedlam, and Hall does well in role of stoic gunboat chief. As much as anything this movie turned the post-war attitude of many, like myself, who thought at the time that we should have been there. When you go this far out on a limb there are going to be some hits and some misses. Brando and the movie's final episodes are pretty much of a miss (Hopper makes it bearable), but the rest of the movie is so damn good it almost doesn't matter; the trip rather than the destination is the big story. I initially had problems with the Redux version as it adds to an already mammoth running time, but I've gotten to like very much the French colonial sequence and also Duvall's surfboard search. There are few moments in cinema that top Sheen's monologue inner voice talking about his mission and Kurtz on his way into the jungle.

I can generally agree with that assessment, but this movie is overly complicated sometimes. The movie has much to say on character and Darwinism. This movie follows Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) as he is tasked to travel downriver from Vietnam to Cambodia to assassinate a former American colonel, Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando). But when Willard arrives to meet the Colonel, he realizes all is not what it really is. Kurtz has sided with the North Vietnamese for reasons of Darwinism and staying alive. He confesses how much stronger the Vietcong were than the Americans. They would go to any length to win the war and that is what gave them strength according to Kurtz. Kurtz was once one of the greatest soldiers in the American army and now after the reality of the war set in, he is taken over by madness and despair. This entire movie is about the journey Willard takes to understand what exactly Kurtz has gone through over the course of the war because Willard is going through the same ordeal.",

Worthless as history (and never intended as such) it nevertheless is a triumph of filmmaking, showing astonishing craftsmanship in every moment of soldier/assassin Martin Sheen's obsessive search for renegade Special Forces Colonel Martin Brando. The plot is episodic (even rambling) as it follows a narrowing river deep into Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, but unlike later, more popular treatments of the war it never pauses to stroke the viewer's guilt or wrap the conflict up in any sort of tidy resolution. Despite the obvious care lavished on every frame, the narrative remains even more messy and incoherent than the war itself, with each new sequence becoming more surreal and disturbing until the final, hypnotic confrontation with Brando and his native army in the pit of his own private jungle hell. Audiences continue to respond more to the helicopter attack on the Vietcong village, ironically the only conventional, 'old-fashioned' war movie scene in the entire film (a point driven home by the heroic Wagner fanfare). The last act, by contrast, is usually dismissed as too murky and cerebral, perhaps because it shows all too clearly how the human conscience becomes an irrelevant luxury when faced with the moral depravity needed to effectively exterminate an enemy. That's not exactly a message anyone wants to hear; witness the patriotic justifications for Operations Desert Storm and Just Cause, and the invasions of Panama and Granada, to name but a few of our post-Vietnam overseas adventures. The end result is a climate of horror few other war films have managed to capture.",
137,14 October 2008,ackstasis,10," ""Horror has a face... and you must make a friend of horror""","Unlike the bulk of war films, 'Apocalypse Now (1979)' is not really about war, or, at least, it is only superficially so. The more significant conclusion to be drawn from Francis Ford Coppola's ambitious masterpiece is how the horror of war reveals the ultimate truths of our existence; how it exposes and illuminates the darkened shadows of the human psyche. The screenplay was adapted, very loosely, from Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness (1899)""  a novel not without its interest, but one that I found rather tiresome reading. Coppola transplants the story from the Congo jungle to the murky depths of the Vietnam War, which in 1979 still left a bitter taste in the mouths of American audiences. The allegory of a man, on the brink of madness, choosing again and again to pursue his own evil upriver is equally relevant in any setting  Nicholas Roeg's 'Heart of Darkness (1994)' was, from what I gather, a more traditional retelling of Conrad's tale, while Werner Herzog's 'Aguirre, The Wrath of God (1972)' uncovered the darker side of Man in the desolate heart of 16th century Peru.",

A lot of people debate whether it's a ""war movie"" I take the position that it's a war movie but that's only part of it.  I think calling it only a ""war movie"" is taking away from how great this movie is.  It doesn't just have the simple ""war is hell"" message that many war films have.  It asks more piercing questions about human nature and character.  It is drama, war, action, art, and manages to be entertaining as well as thought provoking.  Even if the ideas don't grab you there are 3 things you cannot deny of this movie. 1)the acting is all top-notch  2)the cinematography is some of the best ever 3)it is well written.

The acting, cinematography and score are all top notch. I guess this originally was supposed to be directed by George Lucas, but fell into the hands of Francis Ford Coppola and I would not change a thing. John Milius wrote the screenplay to this and along with Coppola, he is one of the best filmakers in Hollywood.

Unfortunately, the negative, 25 years old, was starting to fade, and Storaro was concerned that new prints would not be up to his, or the audience's, high standards. He suggested to Coppola that they re-edit directly into the original negative. This, of course, would eliminate the need for an inter positive, and allow for beautiful new prints to be struck. On the other hand, the original negative in its ""classic"" incarnation would be gone forever. Storaro asked Coppola, ""Let me know one single thing, in the future, in 10, 20, 50, 100 years from now, which version would you want the audience to see?"" And he said, ""This one.""",

151,31 August 2019,psionchronicles,10, My Favorite Movie of All Time,"My stepdad was an MP in Vietnam, and his comment after watching this was, ""This wasn't Vietnam... it was somebody's nightmare."" My mother's take was that it was ""the most satanic movie ever made"". The problem with most movie reviewers and critics is that they evaluate every movie based on the same criteria, which only benefits cinema majors. My stepdad's evaluation was based on how closely it portrayed his experience in Vietnam, and that wasn't really the premise of this movie. Vietnam is only used as a setting here for a re-telling of ""Heart of Darkness"" to make it relatable to modern audiences; anyone with no familiarity with the Conrad novel will completely miss that and dismiss this as a psychotic maligning of the Vietnam War.
This movie was a personal turning point for me. What it excelled at was making me question much of what I'd been taught and shown in my life and my perspectives on things. Willard's line sums it up: ""The more I saw of lies, the more I hated them."" I came to admire how he abandons any notions of being any more or better than what he is. The real grit of this narrative is how you may not agree with his or Kurtz's methods or understandings or morality, but you can clearly understand how they could arrive at them. So based on the criteria of ""movies that made me think"", I give it 10 stars. If I were to rate it based on historical accuracy, I'd have to bump that down to 3; at least it depicts the Vietnam leadership as buffoons, which by all accounts they were. If I were to rate it on memorable scenes and quotable lines, again a 10. Casting and acting I'd give a 10. It did a fantastic job of taking a war movie beyond mere battle scenes and into the larger issues of morality and judgment.",

154,21 October 2005,janet-55,10, Saigon Sh*t!!,"On first viewing of this film I found the story so awful it was painful to watch. I wanted to forget it; but once seen this film lives on in one's memory. Clearly it is a highly allegorical work as is the novel it is derived from : ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad. It says much about the human condition in general not only within the context of war. Strictly speaking the film charts Willard's path through hell and ultimately to redemption. In reality Martin Sheen, who plays Willard, did practically the same thing. Reputedly smoking and drinking just a shade too much until half way through the filming he suffered a heart attack. Coppola's own path through this jungle of a film was equally harassing (watch ""Hearts of Darkness"" to get a better perspective on the making of the movie) resulting on the shoot taking far longer than originally planned. It's difficult now not to elide fact with fiction when discussing this film. Even before it was released I can remember newspaper headlines asking ""Apocalypse When?"" In the event the film was at last completed with the result that it is probably the most searing war film or any other kind of film you are likely to see. The acting throughout is brilliant from Sheen and Duvall, and fascinatingly quirky from Brando and Hopper. The cinematography is breathtaking and the use of music inspired. I cannot count the number of times I have seen it and it still thrills and enlightens me. A must for any DVD collection. P.S. Don't see the REDUX version.",

After reading the novel, I disagreed about the movie's supposed close relationship to the novel and felt the two had less in common than many reviewers claimed.

156,19 October 2017,vaultoverseer_15,10," Best Ford Coppola Film, Maybe even war film","Whenever someone talks about the best Ford Coppola film, most will tell you its the Godfather, and when someone talks about the best war film most will tell you its Saving Private Ryan. While both films, huge in popularity, are undeniably masterpieces, I personally this film surpasses both of them. To a degree its just my personal taste, I like films that are stylistic and more abstract but still engaging, but I think that it definitely needs to be considered one of the best. I know many people consider it as a classic, but according to IMDb user reviews, interstellar is a better film, and saying that is a sin. Interstellar needs to be pushed down, this one being pushed up. What makes Apocalypse Now such an interesting war film is how it handles the war it is in. The book, Heart of Darkness, isn't even set during a war, being a story on insanity. I think setting it in the Vietnam War is great, because not only does it feel familiar to the African Jungles with the natives, but it also focuses more on the psychology effects rather than the physical. I like films like Platoon, Deer Hunter, and Casualties of War, but not only do the feel quite similar in tone, but they feel like the focus on the brutal aspects of Vietnam too much to me. In the war casualties weren't high (for the American side at least) and it wasn't particularly difficult, compared to WW1 or 2. But psychologically, it was damaging, forcing soldiers to kill civilians, de humanize the enemy and eventually themselves. For those reasons that those films fail, both Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket and this film are able to ascend the typical Vietnam film, and to me, actually become poignant. I don't want to ruin any particular scene for anyone who might actually want to watch this film (YOU SHOULD) but just know that 1. The performances are all great, especially from Robert duvall, martin sheen and Marlon Brando. The film can get pretty intense, and sometimes a bit difficult to watch. The last 30 minutes or so are insane, and to me great. To me the film isn't a movie with one highlight, and then the rest not being able to top it. I love Saving Private Ryan, but it is a good example of a film where the Beach scene is so good that nothing ever tops it again, making some scenes personally not as powerful. In this film, you think nothing will ever top the Flight of the Valkyrie scene, everything is constantly proving this film doesn't just have one great scene, but is a variety of great scenes folding together with context, and a film that greatly shows the dehumanizing aspects of war. Overall this is definitely a film in my top 5, my personal favorite Coppola and war film. If you haven't seen this film, you are doing yourself a disservice.",

It's the story of Captain Benjamin Willard, played by Martin Sheen, who travels to Cambodia for an extremely confidential mission. That mission is to kill a renegade Colonel Kurtz, played by legendary Marlon Brando. It might seem like a simple synopsis, but as the film progresses it twists into a complex psychological journey, focusing on the absurdity and horror of war.

Conrad spent years at sea, sailing the world as a professional mariner before embarking on his writing career. He experienced first hand much of the content that wound up in his books. His travels hardened, wizened and salted him. FFC was a self-absorbed, hypersensitive, neurotic, ego-centric hollywood filmmaker. Much like his fellow travelers in hollywood, he was a soft, sheltered manchild completely oblivious of the real world. So, like many before and after him, he had to resort to infantile fantasy in his career. E.g. The romanticized, sentimental, psychologically complex and conflicted mob boss in GF. Pretty much the exact opposite of what these guys are in real life. Same with AN. This fanciful, sanctimonious hippy rock music video set in Vietnam, with elements of HOD layered in (always useful to have an original plot handy free of charge) is too bombastic and absurd to be taken seriously on any level. Too sensationalized to be a good war movie, too superficial and melodramatic to be a serious literary adaptation, AN is one of the most overrated movies of all time. Sheen and Brando are about as believable as SF officers as my cat. (Less actually, she's pretty stealthy & lethal). Sheen was laughably fragile and insipid. Brando was a dull, corpulent sloth, many years past his viability as an actor even then. Both were horribly miscast in these roles.

Based loosely on Joseph Conrad's novela Heart of Darkness, 'Apocalypse Now' tells the tale of decorated soldier Walter E Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando, and the frightening journey of his assassin Captain Willard. Kurtz, who has abandoned his military obligation, has recruited an army of tribal locals deep in the heart of a war ravaged Cambodian jungle. He has in every sense of the word, gone insane. Just like Willard, we know very little of his enemy Colonel Kurtz, and as he descends further towards the Colonels compound, the more he learns about him, and most importantly, himself. As the two men collide, Kurtz's rants and confessions portray a ghost of somebody lost in time and space, reeling with pain and profound hurt, as we hear tales of a renegades life that put Willard's assumed past into some sort of moral perspective. Does Willard have the guts and instinct to carry out the responsibility placed upon him? One of the reason's why 'Apocalypse now' has a lasting legacy over other Vietnam war films is not only due to its cast, but it's director Francis Ford Coppola and his desire and will to defy modern convention and deliver one of motion pictures most analyzed and lorded movies from a near flawless and revolutionary period of cinema. To say Coppola had reached the peak of his creative and artistic powers would be a mere under statement, and to acknowledge the depth and underlying detail he has outlined can not only illustrate the brilliance of his film making psyche, but position the audience in the same chaotic realm as its cast and crew. We see the fanatic struggle of Captain Willard and we see the madness of Colonel Kurtz. The other essential character is the jungle itself, just like an actor, it transforms and evolves many times through out the movie. We first see it as a harmless estuary slowly bend into a tunnel toward hell. We also see a far more primitive tug of war between Willard and the jungle, a war that can only be won and lost in his own mind. 'Apocalypse now' is not a horror movie, but it is so much more frightening. The mark of a great film is it's power to defy categorization, and Coppola's 1979 masterpiece does just that.",

The Vietnam War was far from human and I believe this movie kind of shows have terrible human beings can act under certain circumstances. Modern war movies are spending so much money on effects. This is just a straight forward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination. A movie that really pictures evil and hate mixed in fearness and fate.

178,18 June 2019,RossRivero99,10, One of the best military movies ever made,"Francis Ford Coppola was a director who could do no wrong in the '70's thanks to masterpieces like ""The Godfather"" parts I-II and ""The Conversation"" but this movie was very new territory for him as a director but not asa a screenwriter due to the fact that he co-wrote the Oscar winning screenplay for ""Patton"" and with this he succeeded in making one of the very best war movies of all time. The main character of the movie is an Army captain named Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) who is assigned on a classified mission by Gen.Corman (G.D. Spradlin) and Col. lucas (Harrison Ford) to kill Col. Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who is a renegade soldier who has gone completely insane due to the effects that war has had on him, and whose actions are described as ""unsound"". Willard has to go through extremely dangerous territory whether it's going through battles with the help of Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall), heading a long river with three other soldiers to help him get to the site of his mission, and finally being at the site of the mission which is a potential deathtrap. This movie isn't your traditional war movie because of the fact that there isn't a lot of battle scenes in it which isn't supposed to be the takeaway one gets from seeing a movie like this but the fact that that war is hell and damages a lot of people mentally. When Willard gets to Kurtz's house he meets a photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) who is totally afraid of Col. Kurtz and an old friend named Colby (Scott Glenn) who has become one of Kurtz's followers. The movie is a masterclass in how a movie should be made with a masterful screenplay, amazing Oscar winning cinematography by Vittorio Storaro, great performances throughout (especially by Sheen and Brando who deserved Oscar nominations for their work), and of course flawless execution and masterful direction by Coppola. This is one of the best military movies I've seen in a long time along with ""The Deer Hunter"", ""Patton"", ""The Hurt Locker"", ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", ""Platoon"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Twelve O'Clock High"", ""American Sniper"", ""Inglourious Basterds"", and ""The Longest Day"" just to name some prime examples. This is the very best movie of 1979 and one that is sure to not be forgotten anytime soon, it is a true masterpiece.",

Even the film's synthesized score courtesy of Francis Ford Coppola's own father Carmine Coppola, brings a real sense of unease and wouldn't feel out of place in a horror movie. From the opening shot in which a serene green landscape is infiltrated by yellow fumes and bursts into flames, the war epic is a sensory experience like no other, making you feel the humidity of the jungle with its rich orange palette that bounces of the reflections of the river thanks to the cinematography of Vittorio Storaro.

It might be that I'm just too young, but maybe someone will be able to explain this films greatness' to me someday.

But the rest doesn't live up to that standard: at best it's certainly rambling and uneven. For me, the ending is just wrong: it doesn't in any way fulfil what has gone before, or the threat of the title and the opening sequence, and is actually a bit silly.

192,24 March 2006,mwm-5,10, Apocalypse Now Redux is the definitive film of the Vietnam War.,"This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world. The social criticism of our shallow, commercially oriented values is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the ""war is hell"" cliché, underscored by a mythical journey upriver to Cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate (with extreme prejudice) a rogue colonel, who's left behind the army's concepts of justice to create his own world. When I saw Apocalypse Now in 1980, I thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece. In particular, I found the final segment of the journey with Brando, which encapsulates Conrad's Heart of Darkness, to be rather boring. I finally got around to seeing Apocalypse Now Redux and the flaws have been taken care of. Redux makes the movie an outright masterpiece, certainly among the top 100 films ever made. Brando's performance now seems full and complete, perhaps rather less mysterious, but much more profound. Martin Sheen is brilliant at the heart of one of the best acting ensembles ever assembled. It's great to spot a young Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, etc. in early screen performances that suggest what fine actors they will eventually be recognized as. The work of Robert Duvall, Fred Forrest, Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Bottoms is greatly enhanced by the additional footage. If you've never seen this film, skip the original and head straight for Redux. I wish we could get a Gangs of New York Redux from Scorcese to fill in all the gaps in that deeply flawed potential masterpiece.",

It's a beautifully shot movie and a highly influential one, helping to launch a whole Vietnam sub-genre at the time of which the Italians were extremely fond.

I'm surprised as anyone, seeing as I generally dig his stuff. But his journey into Cambodia just tends to meander through the film. Sure, there are firefights mixed in, but none of this is ever as exciting or mysterious as the film's two most winning features: Robert Duvall and Marlon Brando. And they're only present for such a short time. Duvall is just such a larger than life sociopath; it doesn't hurt that he's at the forefront of the movie's wildest set piece, but he owns the screen. I'm fairly certain the man's ruined ""Ride of the Valkyries"" for me (hijacked, not soured). And Brando looms so large over the entire movie that, you're left wondering what kind of answers are coming when Sheen finally tracks him down. And it's a hallucinatory payoff, to be sure.",

The film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather films) and also had a cameo in the film, as well as produced, was a writer along with John Milius (writer of Jerimiah Johnson, writer and director of Red Dawn, and writer of Dirty Harry), and supposedly did the music as well. The film stars Marlon Brando (The Godfather, Superman, and The Island of Dr. Moreau), Martin Sheen (The Dead Zone, Firestarter, and Gettysburg), Robert Duvall (The Godfather, The Godfather II, and Newsies), Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix movies), Dennis Hopper (Speed, Waterworld, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2), and Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones movies).

202,11 July 2019,jmholmes-73727,10, WHOLE NEW WAY TO VIEW THIS STUNNING MASTERPIECE,"When this movie was released in 1979, the term ""post traumatic stress disorder"" was rarely used, certainly not nearly as often as it is today, to describe the emotional anxieties endured by battle-weary soldiers who had returned from the jungles of Vietnam. It seems today that APOCALYPSE,NOW!, large chunks of it anyway, illustrate the effects of this disorder on the characters,situations and most especially the atmosphere and tone of the work. Perhaps this is the reason it resonated so strongly with some viewers at the time, despite its unsatisfying concluding moments that failed to deliver the big action moment many hoped would end the film. Instead, Coppola leaves us in a heart of darkness, stuck as it were, in a state of mind from which escape seems impossible. Not only does the movie not give us an exhilarating battle scene to match the helicopter attack seen earlier, it doesn't even give its characters a rescue or deliverance, and certainly not a homecoming. Where another fil-maker might have inserted a psychologist to comment on the awful anxieties the men might be going through, Coppola shows in nearly every scene
the insanity of their surroundings and the twisted world of war in which they live. He succeeds in using his film to immerse the audience as much as possible in the hell this war created in the minds of the veterans forced to endure it.
There have been four great films about that war: The Deer Hunter, Platoon, Coming Home, and this one - but it is this one, Coppola's, that seems most personal.",

204,25 March 2008,shadowman123,8, My Redux Review.,"Apocalyse Now has been something that a lot of movie critics have been banging on about for a while! In fact they go on about it so much that they actually end up killing some of its magic I feel. Although it should be something that should be watched by every movie lover the truth was that I was putting of watching it for quite a while. Reasons ranged from me being young and not understanding it well enough to me not really liking war movies that much. However I came across a really cheap DVD copy of it some time ago and thought might as well give it shot. One should keep in mind that this is the review of the redux movie and not the original Copella film version. What I can say is that I understand why this movie won a few awards , I mean Martin Sheen is just plain cool and it is a joy watching him undertaking this journey into madness as well as the creepy but yet enthralling philosophical Brando. The whole movie is like conducting some sort classical music - loud and flamboyant one minute then calm and serene the other ! What I also just loved about it was that the scenes matched wonderfully with the music and thusly creating some sort of magical method of drawing one into its world. The lighting, colouring actually the whole way that the movie was shot actually showed us a trip into the jaws of hell , in which one hangs on for dear sanity but feels completely disconnected from the world around him and that is what I felt that Apocalyse Now is really all about. The down side about Apocalyse Now Redux is that it is a little way too long and does require a solid frame of mind view , one just like Martin Sheen has 'want' it to enjoy it. Although the movie uses visuals and colours nicely it just sometimes drags on a little to far which might cause one to lose interest in it I mean I understand it is a build up to a big climax but it should keep you building towards that and not sway away. To conclude I am glad I finally got a chance to see Apocalyse Now , although it might not have been the original but I am glad I got to see it , because to me it was not really a movie focusing on a war but a movie focusing on the horror of war and the madness it brings with it. As a wise man said 'war is only good to those who have not tasted it', so I would say check it out and draw your own conclusion , I am glad I finally got round to it.",

From this perspective, if World War I is the entrance to the irrational world for the West, then the Vietnam War is the pinnacle, and the title of ""Modern Revelation"" points to metaphysical meaning. Although this film is undoubtedly inspired by ""Dark Heart"", it is indeed different from European culture (German-style war alienation focuses on aesthetics, especially opera-style life impulses). American culture is more violent and emphasizes autonomy. In alienation, the sense of autonomy is particularly strong. Kurtz is regarded as a lunatic (""The colonel is a lunatic, worse than mad, a demon""), but in terms of his self-awareness when alienated, he is still a typical American. This has nothing to do with others (Vietnam in the film is an orientalized Middle Ages or even primitive society), it is about self. This sense of meaninglessness and alienation has brought about profound trauma. It has not been seen in the American war against the Indians and the subsequent war on terrorism. It is an endless void.",

The film is a superbly photographed, surrealistic and dream-like odyssey of Captain Willard. Martin Sheen is outstanding. The bizarre, weird, horrible and morbidly funny intertwine themselves so skillfully that you almost feel like you are there. One of the quotes always remembered about this movie is ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"". But when Duval says ""Charlie can't surf!"" That does it for me. When Willard gets to where Kurtz is it feels like one of those extremely bad dreams where you have been on a long search and you are dog tired and scared to death.But when we get to Kurtz he seems inadequate and not even close to what you are led to expect. The last words he utters are ""The horror....The horror"". The horror is Brando's weak personna and lacklustre performance.

219,4 September 2003,chvylvr80,10, This movie is art,"Apocalypse Now is one of those movies that you can't take in all at once. It takes repeated viewings to appreciate the full spectrum and breadth of the film. Rarely has a film so spectacular and awe-inspiring been made, especially in regards to a war film. This movie boasts a stellar cast, intricate yet simple plot, emotional soundtrack, beautiful locations and cinematography, and a firm grasp of the horrors, weirdness, and confusion of war. Martin Sheen gives what is perhaps the best performance of his career. Marlon Brando provides a suitably eerie and mysterious air. Robert Duvall deserves special praise for his over the top portrayal of Col. Kilgore. The entire cast is wonderful but these three characters stand out. The journey up the Mekong river by the four man crew of the PBR and Sheen is at times funny, exciting, sad and soul-searching. The end of this film is one of the most atmospheric that I have ever seen, and borders on art. The 45 minutes of footage that has been restored to the film are for the most part,worthwhile additions. The French dinner scene however, slows the pacing of the movie and drags on pointlessly. It is the only complaint I have about this masterpiece.

Sheen's character is a steady, slow-spoken guy, who seen enough about the war in Vietnam. Very well-known in the business of seeing the dark side of war as he is called upon a mission to assassinates a colonel who turns out to be a god of a tribe. So, Willard and his platoon ventures up the river. This movie shows the dark and grim side of the Vietnam War. Right after the enormous success of The Deer Hunter, which won an Academy Award for Best Picture, Apocalypse Now was another film that explores the dark and realistic side of the Vietnam War since The Deer Hunter. The film became a blockbuster and a classic war movie. Marlon Brando is perfect as Colonel Kurtz, as a insane colonel who has a another grim side of war.

At the time it was made Coppola was on top form and could get away with the excesses he did (like the character Kurtz who ""is operating out there without any control) but the movie stands as a testiment to one of America's best ever film makers. It is a pity he has not been able to discover his best form since then (although I did enjoy Bram Stokers Dracula) but if you listen to his DVD commentary on one of his lesser known projects ""The Godfather"" you can hear that he doesn't have the heart for movie making anymore which is a shame.

I remember a point at which all of declared ""we're dead already, so what can hurt us?"" In Vietnam, not AA, one learned the true meaning of ""one day at a time"". A ""wake up"" was a victory. One night, several of us whose time grew short gathered at about 5 PM on a hot, dry season day for cold beer and some smoked weed. A new-be came in and someone tossed him a beer (normally, we would have chased him out - ""new-bes to themselves""). He took a pull and then said, ""technically, we're still on duty. What if they catch us?"" A buddy of mine, drunk and stoned already, replied, ""What're they gonna do? Send us to Vietnam?"" That wrapped it all up for me.

As I was watching this movie, I found myself actually TRYING to convince myself that it was good, that at some point during this overdone, self-righteous piece of poo, that some semblance of a theme or motif would come into play. No: The movie continues to lead you down the linear path of the story. I now see where Charlie Sheen inheritted his blank stare acting prowess from that he so consistently displays on a weekly basis in his new sitcom. Well, I guess it is the apocalypse NOW because I've read that Two and a Half Men is the top viewed sitcom on network television. And guess what, this is the 36th ranked FREAKING movie on IMDb. I never thought that a single movie could cause me to never want to watch another movie of the same GENRE. THATS how bad this movie was. 3 hours and 20 minutes of my life, wasted So I thought that, although I normally don't review movies here, why not put in another 2 minutes so maybe, just MAYBE, I could have done some good by watching this movie.

to such an extent Mr. Coppola apparently must have been within a whisker of a nervous breakdown ? The TRIVIA section tells all and it reads
with as much tension as the finished product , even today in 2021 ! "" the few words of dialogue which i do not recall accurately were.
""you are fighting this war for nothing "" This depiction of that war is a testimony to the stupidity , not only of man and sometimes woman ,
fighting, killing, maiming, traumatising to a level that any survivor will never succeed in rehabilitation or recovery , also we the viewers
cannot for one second escape the crude futility of what we are witnessing ? Many brilliant authors and no less numbers of brilliant movie
directors and producers have given us a small window through which we may observe this specific futile pointless and exaggeratedly costly
high human loss rates and exorbitant financial squandering ! The egotistical pure evil and confusion ensuing during those fateful 10 years
of American embarrassment will live infamously in history books throughout the civilised world for decades . Although this movie is undoubtedly accurate as an historical account of a fictional narrative,, it should be shown to school graduates and university students as
a stark example of how when they are in charge to never permit such disagreements leading to all out war . I highly recommend this movie
which I hope and trust no other movie makers will ever attempt to think they could do their version , as nothing and no one can do additional justice to any future war film . Read as many reviews as you can, as they are all valid, apart from the spoilers. And anyone who has the staying
power to sit and watch this right to the very last frame , hopefully will fully realise the powers that control us are very often out of control themselves .....Michael.......",

247,9 May 2006,LuckyGraveyardBoots,10, quite possibly the best and most important film in history,"Even with all the cinema dealing with the trauma of the Vietnam War (Jacob's Ladder, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, and Taxi Driver to an extent) one feels that we don't even know the half of what happened. Even contemplating the horror feels inhuman. And a progression - or retreat? - to the inhumanity that it necessitates is a key part of Apocalypse Now, Coppola's greatest and one of the most important films ever made. Loosely based on Joseph Conrad's 1902 classic, ""Heart of Darkness"" which chronicles the loss of sanity and corruption of morality that comes with distance from civilization - a surfacing of a bestial nature, as it were, a la Lord of the Flies - it brings the story of a physical and psychological journey to Vietnam. The story is of Willard, a general commissioned on a special mission to Cambodia after his first tour of duty in Vietnam is served. Willard at the beginning of the film is stuck in Saigon, psychologically unable to go back home - eerily echoing Nicky in The Deer Hunter. So he is contacted: his mission is to assassinate a renegade Green Beret who has isolated himself in a remote outpost on the Nung River, and who has purportedly gone completely insane - worshiped like a god by the natives, and killing indiscriminately. This man's name is Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando in the second best role of his career (the best being Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire). As Willard journeys upriver in an army boat with some soldiers accompanying, his witnessing the horrors and the insanity - and the overwhelming pointlessness of it all - leads to an eerie sympathy and identification with Kurtz before they even meet. By the time they do, Kurtz's methods don't really seem as wrong or as they should, and they certainly don't seem too unusual or out-of-place. Apocalypse - a place beyond morality, the outpost on the end of the world. The loss of civilization, the loss of judgement, of self. Kurtz's monologue about an atrocity he witnessed as a Green Beret, and his later revelation, is one of the most chilling and well-delivered speeches in cinema history. The film is about trauma, about the human spirit and its breaking point - here, it's a lot like The Deer Hunter, and just as good. Apocalypse, however, takes the boundaries of what we can endure to a global level - Coppola's sweeping footage of the humid, murky jungles of Cambodia and an opening sequence of helicopters amid exploding forests and an orange sky - set to an oddly fitting Doors soundtrack - as well as chilling scenes on the river and of an air raid on a village with Wagner blasting from speakers (a scene which has gone down as one of the most chilling, darkly humorous, and strikingly pointless war scenes ever) - this all contributes to the sense of Apocalypse - the end of the world - and not at some distant point in the future, but Apocalypse Now and forever. The Deer Hunter is much more up close and personal, you can even tell by the title, and shows the totalling effect trauma has on the individual psyche, the breaking down of the human soul, and its ability to either surrender completely to forces of darkness, or to limp on. This is why both films are equal - they are two parts of the same thing. In ""Heart of Darkness"", Kurtz is shown as conflicted between morality (civilization) and his inner savage. In Apocalypse Now, Kurtz has left all conflict behind. He is beyond good and evil. He has let go of morality like a drowning man lets go of a saving hand in the moments before his death. Kurtz indeed is only waiting for death, quoting T. S. Eliot in his temple to himself, lost in the jungle. His last words, and the words echoed at the end of the movie, are, ""The horror...the horror."" He is referring to the infinite void of existence, of the human psyche, and to the pitch black emptiness within his own mind, where atrocities are born again. It is impossible to express in words the experience one goes through watching this film - the experience, in short, that Willard experiences on his journey. The end part, at the outpost, almost in fact comparable to its brother scene in The Deer Hunter, is one of the most deeply, calmly, and seductively disturbing things I've ever seen.",
248,19 June 2008,benjamin_lappin,10, The War That Led To Insanity And Beyond,"Attempting to stay clear of, by running parallel to, the clichéd ""what is the point of war"" motif, Francis Ford Coppola directs a stunning portrayal of loyalty, service and madness during the Vietnam war, perhaps the most surreal and nonsensical of all wars, through his most surreal and the most hard hitting about the condition of men in war, Apocalypse Now. Coppola never glamorises the war, he never shies away from showing the brutal nature of the war, capturing scenes of brutal savagery, the irony of which being that these acts of barbarism were not committed by the Vietnamese that were viewed as savages, but the Americans that came to liberate them.

The ""Redux"" version, released in 2001, runs 3 hours 16 minutes, and the ""Final Cut"" version, released in 2019 for the 40th Anniversary, runs 3 hours and 2 minutes. There are a couple reasons why Francis Ford Coppola would re-cut and re-release the film twice. Directors are notorious for wanting final cut over their films, but are at the behest of the studio, so they want to show you all the other scenes they shot. The majority of the time Director's Cuts do not make the film better, meaning they make it worse. Coppola has another reason to keep re-cutting and re-releasing this film: money. He actually owns the rights to the film, which allows him to generate more revenue with each subsequent release. Regardless, the first version from 1979 is the one to watch.",
250,29 September 2009,johnmschofield,9," This film is like effective medicine, it leaves a really nasty taste but its good for you.",I watched this film for the first time with some friends round about the time it came out on video. I did not like it that much and decided it was just bad. Years later I watched this again on my own and unexpectedly tuned in to the themes which in my opinion is about madness and hope. In my opinion if you watch this film and see everybody as either being crazy or at the very least on the slippery slope to being crazy and in some cases knowing it then I think you will understand what this film is all about. Some of the characters at times act as if there is element of normality in what they do but it doesn't last as the world where this film is set comes crashing in to destroy any hope they may have. The destruction comes in various forms but the end result is always the same. This film is not a feel good film but it is wonderfully well made and everybody who were involved made a contribution and when it finished I said to myself but for the grace of my god I might have been there. I tried to put myself in that jungle on my own and ill equipped mentally or physically and I would have either died quickly or gone mad even quicker. It is a disturbing study of numerous people trying to survive under extreme circumstances and not succeeding. Where there is no sense there is no feeling and to me that is madness and is a horrible cushioning from reality.

256,5 October 2001,lolique,10, Director's cut or director's nightmare?,"Let me first state that I consider ""Apocalypse Now"" in my top 5 best films of all times and the botched, bloated Redux version will not change my opinion. When I first saw the film it was more than just a motion picture, it was a horrifying exploration into the Vietnam war and just like Coppola has stated that it ""was not a film about the Vietnam war, but the Vietnam war"", the picture gripped me more than any before or any after. It is truly a film masterpiece in every respect. Unfortunately the new Redux version is something else. First of all, it incorporates three sequences (the Playboy bunnies in a stranded helicopter, the French plantation and its strange ghost-like characters and the ridiculous scene of Kurtz reading paragraphs from Time magazine to a tied-up Willard), which should have remained in their natural habitat: the cutting-room floor. The rest of the film is a strange mixture of scenes successfully extended to give more insight into the characters, or the excellent dissolve montage at the beginning with the ceiling fan, the stealing of Colonel Kilgore's surfing board, the expansion of Kurtz's dialogue near the end where he comes in and out of shadows, but gone is the tight and to the point editing that turned this river journey from a terrifying and gripping nightmare into a milk run or travelogue more suited for the Discovery or History Channels. They should have followed Willard's advice after the tiger incident: ""don't ever get off the boat again"". One scene in special comes to mind: the one where they open fire on the innocent Vietnamese on the boat that they meet in the river. In the original version this scene came at a moment that the tension in the film was so high that the gunner's reaction was totally motivated and came about as a release to the nervous tension that had everyone in the boat on the edge of insanity. In the new version the killing becomes just a senseless massacre without any motivation at all. And there are many other instances just like it, but hard to pin down from seeing this version only once. Also, the absence of the original ending is a big disappointment. Anyhow, it is sad to see that even with 22 years of hindsight, Coppola still doesn't have the necessary objectivity to manipulate his material again. A prettier, larger package doesn't necessarily make a better film.",

Initially, the viewer is served with the captivating, overwhelming song ""The End"" by The Doors, which I am listening to right now. The song very much describes the imminence of the events about to ensue. The greatest amount of the movie's grandiosity lies in multiple separate, self-contained scenes. One of those is the air strike undertaken by Americans while the Wagner's ""Flight of the Valkyries"" is on and there is a splendid juxtaposition of horror over the Vietnamese and the exhilaration among the Americans. Another wholly self-descriptive scene is that of Marlon Brando confessing with his tremendously pervasive and piercing posture. Robert Duvall's peerless courage and uncommon decisiveness is another completely different, yet scathing, character.

263,28 May 2011,mdenvee,1, Like Lemmings running off a cliff...,"This is how I interpret all the baffling high ratings this movie has gotten from viewers. I believe people will 'make themselves' see a special, wonderful, intellectual movie where there is none. They follow closely with other viewers (like lemmings running off a cliff en mass to their peril). This film reminds me of Citizen Kane- how people immediately assume that movie 'must' be the greatest movie of all time. Can any honest viewer actually watch Citizen Kane and compare it to Gone with the Wind or Casablanca or On the Waterfront or Ben Hur or The Big Country? Citizen Kane will put you to sleep- but people think it's 'supposed' to be artful, innovative, ingenious masterpiece. Apocalypse Now is the same scenario. Many people have heard amazing things about the film prior to watching and thus unconsciously force themselves to find genius and great acting and great script where there is quite the opposite. Other people watch it and see a truly weird, eccentric, failed effort at trying to make a artful, philosophical explanation of Vietnam- an overdone effort with the mantra being 'the weirder and more offbeat and melodramatic, the better'. Newsflash- that kind of movie- making is easy. Being weird and is easy- and it's a strategy to overwhelm the viewer with nonsense to such a degree that even the most objective, critical viewer will conclude 'such a weird, sick, pointless movie MUST be art.. must be genius.. must be a masterpiece. Here's a hint to the other viewers who found this to be the best movie of all time- it's easy to be strange and eerily unconventional. The true masterpieces are those movies which are simple and traditional, yet we walk away from them never forgetting, i.e. Schindlers List, The Godfather, Braveheart, North by Northwest, Rosemary's Baby, The Graduate, The Deer Hunter, etc. These are movies- classics with great acting, writing, and music, and frankly are endlessly watchable. I think any honest movie fan cannot really say they can watch a sleeper like Apocalypse more than once- it feels like a bad acid trip.

264,2 March 2004,paul2001sw-1,8, Apocalypse then,"Francis Ford Coppola was at the height of his powers when he decided to make his gramatically-challenged film 'Apocalypse Now', which pivots around the brilliant idea of using Joseph Conrad's novel 'Heart of Darkness', about Kurtz, a capable and idealistic colonialist gone mad in deepest Africa, as a metaphor for the Vietnam war.  It should also have been the first major American film to address that difficult subject, but it was subject to numerous, infamous delays in production and was not finished until 1979, by which time other films (like 'The Deer Hunter' or, indirectly, 'Taxi Driver') had already addressed the same subject.  What remains is a wildly ambitious film of vast scope, full of astonishing images but possessed of a certain fundamental silliness in a way that 'The Deer Hunter', for example, completely avoids.  Having read the book since I first saw the film, however, one surprising discovery is that the incoherence and relative absence of closure, which some may consider faults, actually derive from the source material.",
265,2 October 2013,Robert_duder,7, Mind numbing but I have finally seen the horror,"Here is the irony of this film for me. I am a student of US History and Politics. I have studied the Vietnam war for years. I have quoted this film, talked about it with many people and yet now I am not so sure I have ever watched it until this very day. How bizarre? But it also shows just how embedded this film is into our very culture, the very definition of a classic. How many of us could poke fun or recreate a scene from this iconic film having never seen it? Now the thing is this film was either brilliant or a steaming pile of crap or something in the middle. However, after reading some other reviews I think we all feel this way. I felt like the final closing scenes of Apocalypse Now were just freaking brilliant. It had one of the most ominous, dark, disturbing, twisted ambiances I had ever seen in a film. It was really interesting to read about the incredible issues Coppola had with Brando because it ended up being breathtaking. But really the whole film is that way. It is dark and twisted and often sickening and I don't think I understand a lick of it because from square one you start to lose your own sanity and just go deeper and deeper into sheer madness. In this way the film is brilliant. Entertaining? Somehow no. I mean the film is excessive in everything and so much of it leaves you with a furrowed brow wondering what is happening.",
266,16 August 2006,nived84,10," ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning.""","Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now is an absolute masterpiece. It doesn't really matter which version of the film you watch; the original '79 version, or the restored and extended ""Redux"" cut. Francis Ford Coppola has said that he personally prefers the longer cut of the film which was finally restored in 2001 and added an additional fifty minutes of footage cut from the original release because of it's already long running time of two and a half hours. When I first saw Apocalypse Now I watched the original version and I was instantly taken by it. It was dark, twisted, and surreal and unlike any other war film I had seen before. A few years later I watched the 2001 ""Redux"" version and was a bit disappointed with it initially. The extra fifty minutes didn't really seem to add much more substance to the overall picture and in return just ended up slowing down the film so much that it just dragged on. Since that time I have only watched the original cut of the film on DVD and still love it. It's one of my all-time favorite war films and probably the best Vietnam war film I've ever seen, and if it's not the best, because certainly Oliver Stone's Platoon is another Vietnam war film that I hold in very high regard, but if Apocalypse Now isn't the best film on Vietnam it's certainly the most original, darkest and fascinating.",
267,9 February 2017,filipemanuelneto,8, A dystopian criticism against all wars.,"Francis Ford Coppola played the sorcerer's apprentice in this movie but, contrary to what happened with the legendary apprentice, the magic went very well. But this film is not about reality or the real Vietnam War. We may regard it as a parody or a joke, but I think its deeper than that, its a statement of the director's opinion regarding the war, in particular Vietnam. And Coppola's statement is crystal clear: war was a total disaster where thousands of Americans died in vain and any war is always the apocalypse. Coppola wanted to give the public a view of this through this movies and we can prove this not only by the shocking graphic violence that punctuates it but also by the dystopic form as the conflict is portrayed and narrated. This way of facing the war is also evident in some of the dialogues. Its as if the war transformed the human being into the worst and raw of the animals, according to Coppola's mind. At first, the film was largely softened with various cuts but, recently, a DVD with an extended version appeared on the market. I understand the reasons: at the time, Vietnam was a hot topic, Coppola wanted to raise awareness and show what he thought about it but he might not want to hurt social morality. But today things are different. The scenes with the Playboy bunnies, however, seem to be left in the film, though they look as animalistic as the soldiers, as if they were objects and not real women.",

270,27 December 2002,jaesboxer,9, The Greatest Film About Vietnam... Until the horribly woozy third act.,"The first two thirds of this movie are, quite simply, the best depiction of the Vietnam War in film. We follow Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), journeying upriver into Cambodia to assassinate the insane Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), through the proverbial Heart of Darkness, into the deepest depths of the chaos that was Nam. However, as soon as we get to the destination, the film goes completely downhill. The final hour really has little, if anything, to do with the Vietnam War. Instead, we a treated to a stoned Marlon Brando mouthing poetry and musing on terror in the midst of a tribal commune in a demolished temple, with Dennis Hopper adding his equally stoned commentary. Thus, Apocalypse Now collapses in on itself. From the interviews I have seen with him, Francis Ford Coppola has always struck me as an egomaniac, and here it shows. The scenes in Vietnam are philosophically rich, beautiful, haunting, and expressive of the strangest war of this past century. The Ride of the Valkyries helicopter attack, with a surfing-crazed Robert Duvall trying to catch a little R and R in the midst of a heated battle is still stunning and brilliant. All the characters on the boat with Willard are widely drawn, and their journey upriver into the depths of the jungle shows a vast range of the madness that plagued the war. In Cambodia, however, the artistic philosophy of the film moves so far away from the characters, that it feels like one is attending a University lecture, given, once again, by the stoned Marlon Brando. As the redux, its worth seeing, I think, but most of the scenes don't really add very much, and some (such as the FRench Plantation), feel completely out of place and really hinder the pacing of the film.",
271,27 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,8," Apocalypse Now is a hallucinatory war epic that delves into the psychological corruption, albeit an overrated film.","After watching this, I've probably seen all the classic war masterpieces so am able to compare and contrast with many variations. There is no doubt that this is one of the best, just not THE best. The story is a loose adaptation of ""Heart of Darkness"" where a captain is ordered to terminate a colonel who they believe has gone mentally insane. Set in the midst of the Vietnam War, this is a visual spectacle. The bluray restoration in itself is magnificent, but the cinematography used here back in 1979 was way ahead of every other film. A yellow tinged filter applied to the majority of the shots to highlight the fire and harsh sunlight. The lighting was exquisitely minimal to enhance shadowy figures and the darkness of the jungle. Coppola's direction is yet again perfect. The narrative was consistently paced. The build up of Colonel Kurtz as a character was stupendous. He was portrayed to be a myth, a legend, with such anonymity yet with ominous overshadowing. Martin Sheen took on a transformative role and portrayed his character with class. A no nonsense captain who's mind is solely focussed on his classified objective. The supporting cast were good, albeit slightly unmemorable (except Robert Duvall). The lavish action set pieces were grand in scale and the mass usage of explosives made the depiction of war feel authentic. But...there lies my problem. On one half the narrative explores the war and its devastation, the other it attempts to expand on the psychological analysis of said war. The two didn't marinate. The only character that evolved psychologically was the captain. Everyone else was just there to exist and further the plot. It wasn't really executed intelligently. Then the confrontation with Kurtz felt like a let down. Brando's performance was great, but his character really didn't feel insane. It was subtly ambiguous, but his build up was loud and clear so it felt like a juxtaposition. Epic war film, mediocre psychological drama.",

285,18 August 2012,TheOguysReviews,10, The Greatness... ...The Greatness,"Apocalypse now is Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece, set in the ultimate heart of darkness: Vietnam. What makes Apocalypse now so great and different from other war films, is that it's not really a war film since his focus is more on the sanity of mankind and the darkness in our minds, in other words our human emotions when we are surrounded by so much destruction in the war. it's amazing how one film can capture the many emotions of great and interesting characters all in two hours and 20 min. the story is when Capt. Willard receives a classified mission to terminate Col. Kurtz, he must run a patrol boat down one of the rivers of Vietnam to to terminate all illegal missions that Col. Kurtz has assigned. Along the way, he doubts whether or not his sanity, let alone Col. Kurtz's, is secure in the setting of the Vietnam War. the film is the adoption of Joseph Conrad's famous book ""the heart of darkness."" His novel adaption is translated into the setting of the Vietnam War, which is a clever idea by itself. Also, we have so many characters that are interesting and want to know more about. My personal favorite character from the film is Kilgore, because he is not stereotypical as a general and has so many interesting qualities to him which makes you want to learn more and more about him. All the other characters are great too! Martin Sheen as Capt. Willard was the most emotional and psychological of the characters in the movie which really makes us interested in the storyline as well. He tells the story through mostly narration, probably looking back on his experiences in the Vietnam War. Marlon Brando an exceptional job as Col. Kurtz, because he made him seem so evil and totally insane at the same time. there are also very many other aspects of the film that makes it so great, the cinematography is incredible, the dialogue is clever, and the adventures are irresistible. Since I don't want any spoilers in this review, I will not tell you the ending, but I will say that the ending of Apocalypse now is one of the greatest endings in film history, and when you see the ending you'll realize how powerful and emotional the ending really is.",

Many of the removed scenes add to Brando and Sheen's character as more of their story is told to the audience. An interesting scene that last for 15 minutes and was taken out entirely was the dinner scene at the French quarters. Here, we see native French ""citizens"" who refuse to leave Vietnam. Others in the group want to go and fear that much of the French influenced countries are being lost. Very political, the scene takes away from the overall violence that makes up Apocalypse Now.

The first being that this movie just felt like a confusing fever dream the entire time and I couldn't really follow the story. The second thing I fixated on was that they killed innocent lives for no reason. For example in that one scene when they shot at an entire village filled with innocent children and women just to go surfing, and don't get me started on the puppy.

I realize this review won't change much, but it surprised me to see that nobody had given this so much as the mildest criticism.

This movie examines the effects of war on man, which in the most extreme case (Kurtz) leads to the darkest depths of a man's soul. Captain Willard (Sheen) must also examine his own beliefs and inner being as he ventures further from all that keeps civilization is check and closer to true insanity in his pursuit of Kurtz.

The mix of the war genre and the tribu/cult genre is just fantastic, is weird, but it really works.
A recomendation, please watch the redux version, think is a little bit better than the original one. Yeah, it's about 3 hours, but you can see very important scenes which are not in the original, like the playboy bonnies scene or the dinner with the french plantation. Marlon Brando is wonderful, he has like 15 or 20 minutes on the screen, but that minutes are enough to watch the incredible performance, and the film editing of his killing, it's chilling and intense.

This was a boring, unrealistic, slow ride to nowhere. I am aware that it is based on ""Heart of Darkness"", but you know what? That was a boring, pointless book as well. I know there are messages all over the movie and the expense of this film must have been incredible. And yes, Duval makes me laugh. But the bad just far outweighs the good here. This movie is a mess. From a movie I seek one of two things, interest or excitement. This had neither. Is that to say that there are no interesting or exciting scenes? No, there are, but the boring, pointless scenes just outweigh them by so much. For a realistic look at Vietnam, I would suggest ""Platoon"" or ""Full Metal Jacket."" For a far out movie that has interest, I would suggest ""Easy Rider"" or ""A Clockwork Orange."" However, if you want to be bored and see some of the silliest war scenes ever, try this one.

313,1 July 2003,swordfish-1,10," A lifetime movie, one of the all time greatest","Well I don't need to say much but Francis Ford Coppola made an astonishing film that will be remembered for decades. With Al Pacino turning down the role of Capt. Willard, and a lot of other difficulties, Master Coppola never quit, even in the toughest time of his life when Apocalypse Now almost got him bankrupt. ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** read at your own risk! The story began with Capt. Willard (Charlie Sheen) being chosen for a very strange mission. He killed a lot of people, but this time it was different, he was sent to kill an american, a high decorated american colonel (portrayed by Marlon Brando). The trip until he found him had some of the most perfected motion picture scenes. All the cast gave outstanding performances starting from Charlie Sheen, Robert Duvall (he won the best supporting actor Oscar), Senior Brando was great as always in his supporting role, so were Frederic Forrest, Lawrence Fishburne and Denis Hooper. The screenplay and the direction from one of the most influential persons in filmmaking, Francis Ford Coppola were at the highest level of greatness and pure cinematic pleasure, really brilliant.

338,18 October 2019,starry-2,10, 4k final cut general review of an arthouse psychedelic vietnam war era film,"This is an amazing and well priced definitive collection of one of the best films of the 1970s and perhaps of all time, the psychedelic and intense Vietnam war era film Apocalypse Now. Like the director (Francis Ford Coppola, who also directed the Godfather series and The Conversation- another best of the 70s film) said in a press conference...this film IS Vietnam. This edition consists of the recently assembled ''final cut""...which is somewhere in length between what was the Redux version and the original 1978 cut. I find it a little more fascinating and gets a little more in depth about the journey and mission martin sheen's character gets involved with. It's the best of Redux really. But what's great about this set is that it comes with all three versions on 3 separate discs so no one is left unsatisfied. It also comes with regular 1080p blu ray versions along with the fantastic unique behind the scenes documentary from 1991 called Hearts Of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse. I would rate the 4k visual presentation at 4 out of 5...the elements used in the transfer to digital are a little faded and I suspect multiple sources of film elements were used to make the final cut. However the cinematography of the film is so strong and well lit that it really overshadows any generational loss or fine details issues. The use of neutral density filters in the shooting of the film is prominent and the hdr color and wide contrast reproduction is vivid and blends beautifully. What is much more amazing is the work that went into the surround sound remix for this release. The low end pulses rather dramatically and deeply and the high end fidelity is penetrating. The use of The Doors' ""The End"" song in the infamous dazzling opening shots/scenes are so mesmerizing and spacious that it gets right deep into your brain via your ears and vibrations through your spinal column. This film is reputed as one of the best sound designed films and it's true. It's one of the only films in existence whereby you can listen to the film with the visuals/tv off and still be able to get the story of the film in great detail. It's a testament to pure artistry and psychology delivery via editing of sound and picture. This goes with Thanks to the ultra genius craftsman of film overall, Walter Murch. It's hard to say which cut is better, which is great that all 3 are here in this collection. I rate this film (no matter which cut/length) a 12 out of 10. The 4k restoration is a 4 out of 5 as stated previously and the sound reproduction, Do get this if you are a fan, or just curious. It's a rare perfect movie thats immersive- delving deep into morality, 'tripping out' and of course, madness.

I was kind of worried, though; I had been so excited to see it, I figured that disappointment from such high expectations was inevitable. However, I was wrong, and I've never been so happy at having been wrong in my life. From the moment ""The End"" began to play over the images of the jungle, napalm, and helicopters, the movie had my rapt attention, and did not let it go until it was done. This is a brilliant, well-acted, and masterful movie. The story is intriguing, the sound track haunting, the action sequences savage and intense, and the effects above what are in many of the movies nowadays. Most movies only have one or two memorable scenes. Apocalypse Now has dozens, but probably my personal favorite is where Colonel Kilgore attacks a village with his helicopter fleet to surf their water. About 20 choppers swoop in, blaring Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" (yes, you read that right) and all but level the village. It sounds vile, and it is, but one look will tell you why it is genius. Colonel Kilgore is without a doubt my favorite movie character of all time, and the other major characters such as Captain Willard, Colonel Kurtz, and others rank on my Top 20 at least. My one and only complaint about this movie is that in the Redux version, there is a scene with gratuitous nudity, that was completely unnecessary. In my opinion, Coppola should have simply left it out. Despite my fanatical praise, this is not a movie for children. There is over 90 f words in it, some very surreal and graphic violence, along with about 5 minutes of bare breasts in one scene. Additionally, the whole atmosphere of the movie is eerie and disturbing, and probably should not be for children.

Basically, the Vietnam war shows no signs of ending, and U.S. Army Captain and special operations veteran Captain Benjamin L. Willard (BAFTA nominated Martin Sheen) has returned to Saigon. He is called upon by Lieutenant General Corman (G. D. Spradlin) and Colonel Lucas (Harrison Ford), military intelligence officers, for a secret mission into the remote jungle. His orders are to follow the Nung River and find Special Forces Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has gone rogue, and apparently insane practising ""unsound"" methods of dehumanisation. Kurtz may have also developed a cult following from both his troops and the native people, so he is to be terminated for extreme prejudice. Willard heads down the river on a Navy patrol boat, commanded by Chief Phillips (Albert Hall) with crew members Lance B. Johnson (Sam Bottoms), Jay 'Chef' Hicks (Frederic Forrest) and Tyrone 'Clean' Miller (Laurence Fishburne). On the journey, they rendezvous with Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore (Robert Duvall) who commands a squadron of armed helicopters, he agrees to escort them. Kilgore orders a napalm airstrike on the locals below, the music ""Ride of the Valkyries"" plays on loudspeakers as they attack. Willard and the crew continue upriver, he looks through files about Kurtz and how he was once a promising officer. They encounter Vietnamese civilians on the way, there are snap judgements gets with severe consequences. Willard later finds out that another soldier was sent on a similar mission to kill Kurtz, but this soldier defected and joined the cult the rogue commander has created. Lance and Chef are under the influence of drugs are getting out of control, Mr. Clean is killed when the boat is attacked by an unseen enemy in the trees, Chief turns hostile, but they are ambushed again and he is killed being impaled by a spear. Willard confides with surviving members Chef and Lance who reluctantly agree to continue on the mission, and upriver they find a bank littered with corpses. While Chef is able to leave and call an airstrike, the other two soldiers end up captured by Montagnard warriors, and they meet an eccentric Photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) who praises Kurtz as a genius. The soldiers see several decapitated heads scattered outside the cult leader's temple. Willard is taken to see Kurtz in the dark lair, he sees Willard as an errand boy, and Willard screams as Chef's severed head is dropped on his lap. Willard is released and free to explore the compound, Kurtz lectures him on his theories of war, humanity, and civilisation. Kurtz wants Willard to tell his son everything about him in the event of his death, but he kills the cult leader with a machete, his dying words are ""The horror... the horror"". Covered with dark stuff on his face, and having read the chilling words of the now dead commander, and taking them, Willard descends from Kurtz's chamber and drops the blood covered weapon. The villagers kneel like he is their new cult leader, but Willard and Lance are allowed to leave and get back to the boat. Having experienced all this devastation, they ride away with the last words of Kurtz eerily echoing. Also starring G.D. Spradlin as General R. Corman, Scott Glenn as Lieutenant Richard M. Colby, Cynthia Wood as Playmate of the Year, Colleen Camp as Playmate, Miss May, Linda Carpenter as Playmate, Roman Coppola (Francis Ford's son) as Francis de Marais, and a cameo from Francis Ford Coppola as thee Director of the TV Crew. The performances by Sheen, Brando, Duvall, and Hopper are all terrific, and the direction by Coppola is masterful. There were loads of problems during the making of the film, such as firing Harvey Keitel from the lead role, and Sheen having a heart attack, but the idea was to create an idea of what being in Vietnam would be like, and indeed you get that sense of surrealism messing with your mind and the danger of the environment. The highlights are Sheen's (real) drunken moments in his bedroom, the helicopter attack, and Brando's only slightly lit (due to his weight) appearances, overall, it is an interesting and watchable epic war drama. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Carmine and Francis Ford Coppola, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Sound Track and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Dennis Hopper was number 80, Marlon Brando number 30, and Harrison Ford number 5 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Brando was also number 11 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and Hopper was number 49, and Brando number 1 on The World's Greatest Actor, ""I love the smell of Napalm in the morning"" was number 12 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, the film was number 2 on The 100 Greatest War Films, it was number 1 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die, it was number 28 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 13 on The 100 Greatest Films.

Each scene I believe tells an important truth about life, death, and the horrors of war. The playboy camp is important, and it does not interfere with the the main story. The engine of the boat is broken, so they have to stop for a while to fix it. At that point, Willard makes the decision to trade fuel for sex. This is not out of Willard's character, because he seems rather charitable throughout most of the story. The scene between Lance and Chef with the girls is important because the viewer becomes those characters, and the scene itself is a game in which the girls are saying something important about exploitation, yet their naked bodies distract the viewer from this important enlightenment, just like Lance and Chef are oblivious to the same fact.",

This theme is portrayed well in the original cut but in redux makes this even clearer. Through the added length, and what some have viewed obnoxious length is purely purposeful to add to this element. As the film is watched you yourself begin to break down just as captain Willard in the movie. The film with the Frenchmen and the woman also add a sense of surreality that the original didn't. The scene with the playboy bunnies also serves this purpose. The extra scene with Kilgore and the laughing and extra surfing add to this also. As a director Coppola was disappointed with the original cut because he didn't believe that it totally brought across the surreal and trippy element he wanted the film to be about. These scenes do nothing but add a human element to the film, as emotion passes from the screen into the viewer. Some people watch movies for pleasure but the redux version is an experience and if you can't handle the awkwardness and discomfort of these added scenes and the experience therein then we know which kind of movie viewer you are.",
363,4 February 2003,ljcjpjlj,10, What a great shoot-em-up movie!,"Apocalypse Now is another of those films that is about half dream sequence. First of all it is a great movie.  It has great characters: Sheen defines the height of his character actor career.  Hopper plays his Easy Rider character o a T,  but this time with a job and a camera. Duval, utters those immortal words ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"" and ""Charlie don't surf!"", and Brando is at his best. It has plenty of Vietnam War action for you, whether you liked the war, hated the war or fought the war, and is a slam-bang shoot-em-up of the kind that has been replaced by the computerized action films of the 21st century.  Realism or the lack of it aside (your opinion, your call) one can't help caught up in Sheen's Willard and his mission to terminate the command of Brando's Kurtz ""with extreme prejudice"" and all the entertaining and exciting stuff involved in this purposeful character's quest.  Never does Sheen's character waiver from this purpose and seldom does the story of the film wander from this path. (when it does wander, you love it.) With ""Redux"", through the wonder of the DVD format (ever heard of too much of a good thing?) New scenes are added (swept up from the cutting room floor) and pasted in here and there.  A new viewer of Apocalypse Now Redux might not notice that the bits are added, even though the movie has gone on past his bed time, but a veteran watcher of it might find them annoying, irrelevant, and easily skipable.  To me the ""Redux"" version came down to this question:  ""OK, so they didn't change the ending, why did they change the end"".  In ""Redux"" I seriously miss the dreamy end with its combination of napalm, burning trees, The Doors and the final credits.  I'd give up all the cutting room floor stuff for the original finale.",

365,28 February 2006,johno-21,10, One of the best films ever made,"This is one of the finest films ever made. Francis Ford Coppala took a huge budget, a huge cast, made a location film outside of the US and took a controversial topic, being the Vietnam War and managed to put all this together and emerge with war film unlike any other. Martin Sheen as the principal character on his mission to his confrontation with the renegade colonel is outstanding. Marlon Brando as that colonel dug deep into somewhere to come across with his memorable performance. Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford, Sam Bottoms, Frederic Forest are among the excellent cast. This film has great acting, great character development, a great screenplay, fantastic sound, incredible editing, outstanding cinematography and it's art direction and photography are superb. Just so many elements that go into making a great movie so successfully accomplished here that it's hard to appreciate a single technical element with so much going on and cohesively coming together. The inventive storyline was such a departure to everything that had been shown on TV and in the papers and magazines about coverage of the Vietnam War and it's depiction and reference in other films. The trip up the river begins like a Tarzan movie and evolves into Road Warrior movie and to a Star Trek mission to a western to a psychedelic freak show with a war going on all around it. I've seen this many times but remember when I saw this in the theater when it first came out and people instead of talking among themselves about as they left the theater were just going Wow! This film had eight Academy Award nominations, all deservedly so, but only won two for Sound and Cinematography. I would give this a 10 on a scale of 10 and highly recommend it.",

367,4 September 2019,peeedeee-94281,8, I'm just here to report about the Final Cut,"I just watched the Final Cut and it looked and sounded great! But I saw the Redux version 20 years ago and was hoping Coppola would have listened to the critics and removed that plantation scene. Alas, it's still in there, in the final cut. It's the one major flaw in his revisions of his film. I feel the original theatrical cut got it right. The pacing was perfect, and it just kept the build up going. But this nagging french plantation, while interesting, so very out of place. It stops the movie dead in its tracks for a good 20 minutes. I kind of understand why Coppola wants it in there, because they give a bit of a history lesson on how things came about in the Vietnam conflict, with the french being the original colonialists. But the movie, the way I see it, is bigger than just the conflict. While it's set in Vietnam, it wasn't specifically anti-vietnam war. It was more like anti-war in general, and anti-colonialism, like the book. But by doing the history lesson in the plantation scene, it kind of ruins the metaphorical aspect of the film.
Anyway, that's my rant on that scene. It's a wonderful film to watch, at least I know the aforementioned scene is a good spot to go for a bathroom break!",

370,11 February 2014,phobonnika,10, The 11th greatest film of all time.,"What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? During the Vietnam War, Captain Willard is sent on a covert and dangerous mission into Cambodia to assassinate a renegade colonel who has set himself up as a god among a local tribe. Perhaps the problem that people have with Apocalypse Now is that they take it as a serious war film. I can't think of a genuinely serious American war film that could be considered a masterpiece, yet Coppola's proof that his top-running 1972 contender for the 'perfect movie' consensus could be made more perfect in every aspect: Apocalypse Now, is undeniably a masterpiece. So as logic stands, we must rethink what Apocalypse Now is generally assumed to be. Despite being one of the most well known and iconic films on the list, such a bright spotlight does not detract from its majesty. The opening scene to any film is always an indication of the shape of things to come, and Apocalypse Now benefits from one of the most stark, minimalistic sequences of intense pulchritude ever to be directed. What follows is both startling and balming. With a velvety narrative for company that relaxes for the most part yet still reminds us from time to time that what its discussing has the potential to be very upsetting, we are taken through a journey of immense significance to the world of cinema. It might not be a proper, thoroughbred war that the journey brings you through, but it is certainly one of startlingly beautiful decadence, torment and discovery. Just watch Captain Willard's (Martin Sheen) development and how he comes to terms with the task at hand as the jungle setting, filmed in such an aspect ratio to bring out its full potential of mystery and danger, rolls by in the background, and inhale and exhale. Of course, Apocalypse Now isn't just pretty to look at. It contains some of the most classic scenes of all time, above all the popular culture's all-time favourite of the strikingly bold attack on the Viet-Cong outpost in a fleet of helicopters beaming Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"". Although this scene is as intense and vivid as cinema can reach, a scene of pure sensation, dazzling audiences with light and noise, laying bare the stark horror - and unimaginable thrill - of combat, it's the arrival at Colonel Kurtz's (Marlon Brando) camp that is the most curved apex of Hollywood's camera-work ever to be pieced together, an audio-visual descent through the threshold of necessary insanity and surrealism with the single plucks of a sentinel double bass to reinforce it. It's a simply staggering piece of American filmmaking. Apocalypse Now isn't so much an important work, a turning point or a revelation about how to make films like the next feature on the list, but it's something that exceeds all prejudices in purely showcasing the depth, finesse and density of simply pleasurable art that celluloid organic matter has been able to create.",

The camera work contributed to creating such a highly respected film, with the dolly shots, the long shots with the Vietnam scenery, medium to medium long shots, and the establishing shots of the ocean and sunsets. It was extremely well done, and the fact that it was filmed in Philippines likely allowed it to be as realistic as possible. Sound helped as well, with non- diegetic music playing during action scenes, building up intensity as the action would pick up. The character's were very believable, and they were dressed the part to make it for an authentic experience. With such amazing acting, and with the cast alone, this should be watched for all film lover's. It's got everything in it, but it is not a war film as one might believe.

I do not mean in the sense that it made me cry for hours, but I meant that it had so much substance to it. The film follows Captain Benjamin Willard as he is sent up a river into Cambodia during the Vietnam war to assassinate a Colonel (who has gone insane). From the very opening scene (which shows a jungle being immersed in napalm) to the very last moment, you are completely engrossed. This film has elements of comedy, violence, gore, and (in the redux version) some nudity. Needless to say, this film has had good reviews and is a very famous war film. It must be said, however, that this film is not for the squeamish. It is not over the top in gore (like the Kill Bill movies) but it does have some very graphic violence in it.

390,16 October 2016,robert-259-28954,9, A landmark work of filmmaking.,"This iconic motion picture can be summed up in a single phrase: A descent into Hell. In essence, the sum total of the Vietnam War. It begins as a relatively bland exploration of life in the military in those days, more specifically in the life of a single soldier, given the distasteful task of the elimination of a rogue officer. Then it immediately, inexorably morphs into an abundant panorama of the horrors that characterized the horrors of that tragic and unnecessary conflict. The director, a superb Francis Ford Coppola, wisely relies on intense visual imagery to tell the story, instead of using the heavy-handed moralizing or storytelling so liberally used in most depictions of war, allowing the ever changing landscape to reveal this soldier's tale of both inner confusion and his unflinching, rigid implementation of military code. In his incredible use of the filmmaker's art, Coppola gradually develops a sense of fear and dread unseen in previous war films, epitomized by the final appearance of an incredible Marlon Brando in one of the most memorable and controversial roles of his career.",

No doubt that scenes such as that were very realistic, and probably US soldiers did that and worse, knowing how much disregard they have for human lives in real life (i.e. The Gulf War, WW2, Korean and Vietnam Wars). I am extremely disapproving of war in general, and there is a lot of pain left over from these unnecessary battles that are lasting, for the innocent victims. If there should be a movie at all about how horrifying war is, it should not be graphic, intensely disturbing displays of mass murder; but a thorough examination at the psychological aspect of those involved with the war: the soldiers figbting against each other, the families of those who leave for war, the emotional scars of those who have lost a loved one.

403,3 April 2022,lucaschergen,9, Apocolpyse Now and the Horror,"Coppola's epic ""Apocalypse Now"" is probably one of the most important war movies in history. The movie does not only address political topics like war, colonialism, imperialism and capitalism, but also covers philosophical topics like absurdity, the inner-self and savageness of man kind. The criticism of America's involvement in southeast Asia is obvious. The film does not hesitate to portray everything that is a result of capitalism and imperialism as evil and negative, hitting a nerve, since the US's involvement in foreign countries is criticized to this day, making the film extremely contemporary. While the movie is an adaption of the novel ""Hearths of Darkness"", which addresses the effects of colonialism in the Belgian Congo, ""Apocalypse Now"" portrays the exact same effects, just changing the setting and adding the nuance of modern cold war imperialism. The philosophical standpoint of the film is just as important as its political message. The idea of horror is the main idea of the movie. The horror being our savage selves, which can only be reached through a long journey, during which we lose piece by piece our civilized face, our existence falling into absurdity. Coppola manages to portray the search of our inner self as something we don't want to discover. While most movies try to portray this journey as a sentimental journey, connecting to ourselves, Coppola portrays it as a long, violent and dark path that, after watching the movie we don't want to go down, out of fear, not out of fear of encountering horror, but becoming it. Apocalypse Now triggers a feeling of absurdity: How can there be a sense of life if at the end of the journey to our inner selves we encounter plein horror. By giving the viewer this feeling Coppola connects the movie to the French writer Albert Camus' idea of the pointless life, existence with no reason, since if we turn to our savage selves we turn into something condemned by society: horror.",

Defiantly the best war film I have ever seen. It was both a spectacle and a horror. It's fucking haunting, seeing all this destruction. What coplla manages extremely well is creating chaos that we experience through the eyes of the protagonist. There's incredible set prices like the bridge and the city that play with light and fog to create this dreadful atmosphere and a visually striking picture that left me completely flabbergasted as to how they achieved this all in 1979. It's impossible to talk about this film without mentioning marlon Brando. He may be a crazy method actor but by god does it work here. He's shrouded min mystery both literally and figuratively, lit by shadows and shrouded in fog after the nearly 2 hour build up to his character and so after all this hardship and trauma they face getting to him, this performance is built up and resolved perfectly. I realise I watched the shorter version and there's a three hour version out there but one of my only criticisms is that he's only in it for around 10 minutes. Even so, it leaves a massive impression on the viewer which is what makes it so iconic.
Another massive contributor to this errie and haunting atmosphere is the soundtrack, splicing classical music to rock to the main oppressive synth score creates this mismatch of tones and styles that runs throughout.
Despite being surreal and horrific in places, it never stops feeling realistic, keeping this tangible horror of the story. Speaking of, this is a prime example of how to adapt a classic book to a different time period, taking the novel heart of darkness into the Vietnam war shows that this idea of savages and humans, ya and them still relates to this day, the vietnam war ending only around ten years from when the film was made.

Director Frances Ford Coppola claimed that this film wasn't about Vietnam, it was Vietnam. At any rate, he creates a masterpiece. It is the gruelling story of an emotionally tormented Lieutenant whose mission is to ""terminate with extreme prejudice"" a Colonel who was responsible for the deaths of Vietnamese leaders. This will involve a journey by water to Cambodia where the Colonel dwells. Another achievement by Coppola who also made The Godfather and The Conversation. Martin Sheen does a tremendous job as a Lieutenant torn between the life he left and the hell he's drawn too. Marlon Brando delivers a powerful performance as the Colonel thrown between greatness and insanity. Robert Duvall plays a crazed Lieutenant who barely flinches at turmoil, and appears more interested in surfing the waves during a violent raid. Dennis Hopper plays an unstable photographer who appears completely strung up on drugs and devoid of any form of reality as he chants to Sheen about the gruesome society around him. Frederic Forrest play Chef, whose passion for cooking leads to a jungle search for mangos and an encounter with a tiger. Tremendous masterpiece about the horror that war truly is. Score: 10 / 10",

423,7 January 2017,KineticSeoul,10, Imaginative and deep look into the Vietnam war and the indoctrination of evil.,"This is a very interesting, dark and somewhat surreal look into the Vietnam war. It's a intense and deep movie with a lot of imagery that shows the evil side of men. This was a very very difficult movie to produce and direct because of many different set backs, budget constraints and conditions. Marlon Brando's condition was one of them, because he was a difficult actor to work with. Despite his excellent portrayal of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz. The plot is about Captain Benjamin L. Willard(Martin Sheen) who has his share of seeing the dark side of humanity, horror and evil getting sent off on a mission to find and track down and eliminate Kurtz for unspecified reasons. For Willard, Kurtz is someone that he secretly has somewhat of a respect for and to a certain extent understand where Kurtz is coming from. In another words Kurtz is someone that resonated with Willard. It's actually very clear where Hideo Kojima got some of his ideas for the first ""Metal Gear"" video games. When it comes to a soldier who is facing his own demons and longing for war trying to track down and eliminate a legendary soldier. When it comes to this films portrayal and mentality of most soldiers during the Vietnam war, it is shown for what it was instead of glorifying it. It delves into the inner persona of the soldiers during the Vietnam war and how to some of them it was just a big game. Maybe to show how seeing so much death and carnage can numb the human conscienceness. As a matter of fact the more Willard and his group delve into the jungle the more he experiences dehumanization. And how some people may play nice to hide the evil within their hearts. This is a very ambitious, ambiguous and masterful film that really immerses the audiences into the indoctrination of evil on screen because of war.",

The film is not perfect, but even with its imperfections, it soars above most other films made about Vietnam. ""I thought you were in charge"" is the line I remember most because it perfectly describes the confusion of the American soldier without either military or political leaders to lead him into battle. Wars are not meant to be ""holding actions"" or ""policing actions"" (like the Korean War). Wars are to be fought to win or lose; there is no in-between. If not, then you should not go to war in the first place. One of the funnier parts of the film is the buildup of Kurtz as a rough and tumble macho man, and even with the filming in the shadows, we can see Brando is about as macho as Jonathon Winters or Orson Welles in his later years. Other than that, the scenes are very well done. See it for yourself.",

They jumped ship realising that farmers, agriculturalists and herdsmen from a socialist state really did have the upper hand. They knew their country.

434,5 June 2023,CinemaSerf,7, Apocalypse Now,"This is, I think, the definitive Vietnam war movie. Martin Sheen is ""Capt. Willard"", a war weary veteran who is sent on a top secret mission to track down and stop the rogue Colonel 'Kurtz"" (Marlon Brando) who is operating independently from Cambodia. With only a small crew of rookie squaddies, he sets off along the treacherous Nung River where, along the way, they alight on ""Kilgore"" (Robert Duvall) and face all sorts of dangers against both man and nature as they seek their quarry. The sheer intensity of the journey, and of the challenges it throws up cause ""Willard"" to re-evaluate his whole perspective, and not just on the war, as the horrors of this conflict manifest before him. It's a stunningly strong depiction of war; the humanity and vulnerability of the characters - even those who are outwardly strong - and the casting is inspired. It's bloody and gory at times, but never gratuitously and the closely shorn Brando is in a class of his own as the megalomaniac ""Kurtz"". Though fictional in fact, it doesn't pull it's punches and leaves us all with a bitter taste in our mouth and some seriously thought-provoking questions.",

Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" is the most highly acclaimed film to explore the dark underside of the war in Vietnam. It takes the viewer on a mythological journey through the war torn jungles of southeast Asia, but fails miserably to deliver what it sets into motion. The film promises good performances from its actors, and it delivers in that regard. The cast is loaded with talent, most notably that of Robert Duvall. His characters' presence in the film is short in duration, but very moving. In the beginning (like ""Platoon""), ""Apocalypse Now"" seems to provide a glimpse into the psychological impact of an anarchic Vietnam on its wartime inhabitants. The film moves along nicely as Sheen journeys to find his imposter (Brando) who has concocted a dangerous cult following in the jungles of Cambodia. Several incidents along the way (again, like ""Platoon"") give the viewer insight into how unstable wartime conditions manipulate every mans psyche.",
439,7 November 2006,Dr_Coulardeau,10, There is no justice and no justification in any war,"A long awaited version of this cult film. Even Francis Ford Coppola has been submitted to cuts in one of his most important films. They say it was commercial. They know it was not entirely. One main scene was cut off : the French plantation scene that reveals how the Americans had played a double game during the war in Indochina between the Viet Minh and the French : they had helped the Viet Minh and hence had produced the French defeat. Poor loser's explanation, for sure, and yet not entirely false. Think of the Americans helping Saddam Hussein against Iran, or the Djihad in Afghanistan against the Soviets. We know the results. Double agents are always those who lose in the end. But this full and final cut of the film, though it does not change the meaning of the film, does change the depth of this meaning. We get down into horror little by little as we go up the river. Of the five men on the boat the first to die is the black soldier, and then the second to die is the black sergeant. The blacks have been eliminated first : quite a symbolical truth. The third victim will be the white soldier from New Orleans who speaks French. It is also very symbolical today, though maybe less in those days, though it was symbolical of what happened to the French in Indochina : they were defeated. The only two survivors are the two white pure Americans. But what is shown under a new depth is the meaning of this horror. We could have thought Kurtz used the basic and daily horror of those historically-retarded jungle people to impose savagery and total carnal violence. But what appears now is that it is not the savagery of these people that produced their war but it is the war imposed from outside that produced the savagery, or liberated this savagery from its box. In other words a war that comes from outside, and I have the propension to think all wars always come from outside, even the most patriotic and justified defensive war, such a war liberates the deepest layers of the survival instinct in man, not even the animal instinct of survival. These men who commit gratuitously-embellished violence do not plainly aim at surviving which would simply imply killing their adversaries, enemies or challengers.They survive in a completely different way : they have the feeling to be alive because they make the other die in atrocious suffering and in the most barbaric way. It is not so much the dying of the enemy that gives them this feeling of being alive, but the torture, the suffering, the horror in which this death is performed. In other words it is no longer only the survival instinct that is at stake but it is also the pleasure instinct. In other words they transform the cold necessary killing of an enemy into a hot pleasurable sexual event that replaces real sexuality. Killing in such a horrible way becomes a pleasurable intercourse and the victim is seen as fulfilling its destiny, just like the buffalo that is killed at the end of the film. A man who enters such a war is supposed to accept his dying in such a sacrificial way because that is his ultimate function. But then where is the war ? We have regressed to the emergence of humanity from animality, of man from the animal he was before : this dire moment when human beings felt that killing animals had a religious dimension, when human beings felt that killing their enemies had a religious dimension, that is to say in both cases a pleasurable power dimension. That led humanity to inventing religions, religions that originally always justified the killing of enemies and that provided the believers with the conviction that they had special powers enabling them with unfailing and totally justified capabilities, powers. But what will remain after this thrilling sensation of absolute power provided to soldiers by those sophisticated new technologies that kill with a microscopic precision ? The horror, nothing but the horror, the haunting and gnawing question : Why did I do this ? Why did I feel pleasure when doing it ? Why does it feel so easy to go beyond limits that should never be trespassed, such as into torturing activities ? And for us the film brings up one question : Is there a Kurtz in each one of us ? Is there an Eichman in each one of us ? Is there an Auschwitz in each one of our memories ? Coppola seems to tell us that war is a Pandora's Box that we better not open. Coppola is in phase with Clive Barker who tells you war, and maybe life, is a secret cube that you must not open because beyond it there is nothing but suffering and the pleasure of inflicting as well as receiving that suffering. The old film was a masterpiece, this new director's cut, or redux is a biblical masterpiece : think of Abraham who is going to sacrifice his own son with the full assent of everyone around him, or at least no protest from them, including the son himself, and God replacing the son with a ram at the very last minute to symbolize that humanity has to move away from any type of human sacrifice, even in war. Human life is sacred and no human being has the right to take one single human life away. That's where Kurtz is wrong : everyone has the right to judge him, to call him a murderer, but no one has the right to perform justice and to kill him to do so, except in a completely perverted version of rightfulness.",

His sensibility is melodramatic and his penchant for freakishness is annoyingly distracting. I am also bothered by his frequent resort to bizarre camera angles and extreme lighting effects. For example, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is introduced at the beginning of the film with his head upside down on the screen while a dream- scape of attack helicopters and napalm bombs rushes through his mind, frequently obscuring his face. Toward the end of the film, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), whom Willard has been pursuing under orders to assassinate him, is introduced in blackness and only gradually emerges into light in an overly l-o-n-g scene. Among the freaks in this film are Robert Duvall as a commander of a helicopter attack squadron who likes to wear a horse-cavalry cowboy hat and is obsessed with surfing and Dennis Hopper as a crazed cameraman whom Willard finds among Colonel Kurtz's devoted followers. Coppola's visual imagination, which served him well in the Godfather films, undermines Apocalypse Now in my estimation.

Apocalypse Now is actually a modern retelling of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now reintroduces and builds upon the themes presented in Conrad's masterpiece.

With that said, I believe that this movie is astounding. It is an excellent war film that doesn't so much concentrate on the gore and brutality of the Vietnam Conflict, but more the psychological toll that it took on the young, inexperienced ""kids"" who were sent to fight it. Coppola showed real genius in the art of film-making, using many visuals to help tell the story. The acting I felt was definitely all-around up to par. Marlon Brando's part in the movie is what really got me as far as acting. His elucidation to Willard at the end of the film reels you in, and reveals the hollowness of a man that you've heard about and wanted to see throughout the movie.

He is to travel up the Nung River into Cambodia in a U.S. Navy patrol boat and assassinate, Colonel Kurtz, a renegade Green Beret operating independently and staging hit-and-run attacks against the Viet Cong who has set himself up as a God among the Cambodian natives. The U.S. Army believes Kurtz has gone completely insane, but Willard soon discovers the Colonel's bright past. As Willard and his crewmates slowly crawl up the river, with many horrific and strange encounters, more is revealed about Kurtz and Willard slowly becomes more and more like the man he was sent to eliminate.",
450,12 March 2012,dee.reid,10, It'll blow you away (based on the Redux version)!,"""Apocalypse Now"" is as powerful a war film as you're ever likely to see. The film is basically a mad-house of powerful imagery, sounds, and moody atmosphere - all this is done at the highly capable hands of director Francis Ford Coppola (working from the novella ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad). Coppola is not one of my favorite filmmakers, but ""Apocalypse Now"" is the one film of his I've always admired and had a deep fondness for. The film works on a base level that seems to appeal to your worst feelings. ""Apocalypse Now"" is a dark, violent, visually disturbing motion picture. Set during the Vietnam War, the film concerns the covert mission of Captain Benjamin L. Willard (the great Martin Sheen, in my favorite performance of his), a military assassin, to kill the rogue Colonel Kurtz (the late Marlon Brando), who has proclaimed himself god in a heavily fortified fortress located deep in the heart of Vietnam. Willard accompanies a small Army boat crew to take him up a river for him to complete his mission. ""Apocalypse Now"" is a war film that does not play around in the visually disturbing imagery category, including the graphic combat violence and the (reportedly) live slaughter of a live a water buffalo for a ritualistic sacrifice by Vietnamese villagers. Kurtz's powerful final words signify the meaning of the whole picture - the utter ""horror,"" and the utter insanity of war.",
451,23 February 2020,labontearia,10, The horror,"Apocalypse Now, directed by Francis Coppola, is an American's version of the Vietnam War. Willard, played by Martin Sheen, is sent on a top-secret mission to take out Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a rogue Colonel who has lost his mind and is dishing out the war on his own terms. The movie follows Willard and the crew of the PBR on their journey through the war-ravaged areas of Vietnam to find Kurtz.
Along the way Willard and the crew are presented with obstacles. There's a general who refuses to help unless he can see some good surfing, a battle where no one seems to know what's happening, and merciless and frenzied killing of multiple natives for no apparent reason. It seems as if Coppola is waging his own question along Willard's journey - is it just Kurtz that has lost his mind, or is the whole war itself the real absurdity? The movie seems somehow both realistic and fantastical. What kind of general would be demanding people surf as napalm strikes are dropping? What kind of battle is being waged when there's no one in charge and no clear enemy? (And yet, despite the films over-the-top-ness, for many American's, this was a version of reality.)
By the time Willard makes it to Kurtz he's lost almost all the crew of the PBR. And while it's obvious that Kurtz has definitely lost it, he's not necessarily as crazy as one would think. He poses great philosophical points (we send boys to war and expect them to kill people but tell them they can't write profanity on bombs because it's too obscene?) and, after the journey experienced throughout the film, Kurtz doesn't seem like that bad of a guy. There is excellent camera work at play during Brando's scene that keeps Kurtz shrouded in darkness, resulting in an almost mythical quality. We never really know who he is, but Willard does know who he is, and he is a man that follows through. Though he seems to take Kurtz' words to heart, he follows through with his mission and the movie ends on him reflecting on Kurtz' own words (the horror... the horror).
The cinematography is something to behold. The movie is visually stunning with sequences involving unreal aerial shots, explosions, boats, and more, there is something to be said for the production too. It all culminates into one over the top-action packed, genre bending (dark humor? Drama? Action?) must see film. 10/10",

This is much more than a war movie.  It is about ""the horror""(as Brando's character echoes) that consumes human being when they seek after power and meaning in a totally messed-up world. Coppola usually works with extremes which reveals what he is up to in his movies.  The real star of the movie is Martin Sheen because he is there from beginning to end, although Brando got more attention.  Sheen's character is a man who knows nothing but the war and could not leave to go to any other setting.  He is summoned to hunt down Kurtz in Cambodia(outside of our war zone) and is told that he has lost his senses and is leading a group of natives and basically has become their God.  Sheen and a few navy people head up the Nam river to find Kurtz and run into a few strange people along the way.  One (an officer played by Robert Duvall) is more concerned with surfing than being an officer in the war.  What makes this picture works is that the insanity doesn't end.  Kurtz is found and after Sheen's character spends some time with him, he does his duty.  This is insanity in itself because he realizes that Kurtz is no worse than anyone else when he gets there but does not stop himself.

472,18 July 2009,valadas,8, Madness always and everywhere,"In this movie everybody is insane and not only Colonel Kurtz because any war is insane in itself and can only produce insanity. Values are so much degraded that we cannot distinguish between right and wrong anymore. It's the story of a captain who during the Vietnam war is sent on a special mission aimed at killing a former American colonel who went insane and left the army to go into the jungle in Cambodia where he formed a private army with local tribesmen and went on fighting the war on his own making lots of atrocities. Horror is more or less his motto and his obsession. Besides that he is also a poet and a philosopher and this feature of his discourse fits well in his behaviour. The movie develops itself by showing the course of the captain on his way to colonel Kurz's stronghold on a small Navy boat up a river through the jungle. During that course he and the crew of the boat find themselves involved in several happenings showing the true face of war, some violent and some delirious like for instance in the beginning the attack of helicopters against a Vietcong position by the sea, accompanied by Wagner's ""The Valkyria"" commanded by a crazy Cavalry colonel insisting of surfing on the sea while bombs explode everywhere around; another delirious scene is when the boat on its course arrives to an army post where there is a musical show for the soldiers performed by a few Playboy bunnies coming from USA who in the end have to seek sudden refuge in the helicopter that had brought them to avoid being molested if not raped. Another curious but full of meaning sequence is when the boat arrives to an old plantation owned by a French family who refuses to leave despite the war. The conversation at dinner between the family members and the captain is rather interesting to follow showing how differently French and Americans faced the war going on there. The movie is well directed and well performed by the whole cast and Marlon Brando as Colonel Kurz who appears only in the end is not better than the rest. Most sequences are really moving and touching and composed by impressive images. Perhaps the only flaw of the movie are the last scenes, a bit too theatrical in relation to its general atmosphere.",

He was constantly too high to do his lines by heart, he was so fat and out of shape that Coppola had to do his scenes in a different shade of light just to make him look plausible as a soldier.  His attitude alone put the film over-budget and behind schedule and that bothers me.  When one person thinks he is bigger than the collective whole, it takes away from the experience of watching the film. It was impossible for me to watch Brando on screen and not cringe.

Every technical element from the picture such as sound effects, original soundtracks, camera quality IS actually as decent as from the original, perhaps even better. But this is not actually important, is it now. I mean, you most certainly do not want to watch an extended version of ''Apocalypse Now'' just for a 'smoother' result, now do you. The main point of this new version was to get to see the movie completely uncut, to view the original with all it's cut out footage. And that, dear friends, is an absolute let down. The majority of the new footage is mostly simply pointless and boring to watch. In fact these missing scenes are SO dull, that they actually cast a sort of a shadow on the original movie in this version, thus making the whole 3 hours and 16 minutes of this film look weak and frustrating to sit through.

However this film set in Vietnam though based on the infamous Heart of Darkness is brilliantly directed, constructed and photographed. It is a mesmerizing journey into a nightmare. The cast is all over the place. Sheen does very well in the lead role, Duvall is superb as is Forrest and a very young Fishburne and Bottoms both are appealing, but what on earth Hopper and Brando are doing is a mystery to me, but somehow it all works, including the incomprehensible ending and I'm not even sure why. As intriguing as any war film ever made with scenes that are truly unforgettable. Apocalypse Now Redux is a version released many years later adding scenes that were originally left out and I, as opposed to many, believe they add nothing to the film and actually slow it down. I was hoping to see one of the rumored alternate endings, but alas, that part has not been changed and it's the one part that needed it.

""Apocalypse Now"" is a story of how a man becomes a psycho and a madman. there is chaos everywhere and it really seems like it's the end of the world, I know that when I saw the film there were moments I couldn't believe actually happend in real life and you really get this sort of feeling that it's the end, just like the song of ""The Doors"". the actors were absolutely fantastic: Martin Sheen is great and delivers a good performance. his character is a perfect example to what a anti - hero is. I mean he does have a lot of features that show he isn't a hero like rambo or he is not a soldier that will save innocent people. Martin Sheen's character is the type of tragic and anti hero who cares of nothing. Robert Duvall is perfect in his role with his famous catchy line ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"". Marlon brando should have recieved an academy award for his portrayal as colonel kurtz, or at least a nomination, I just wished we got to see more of colonel kurtz early in the movie maybe flashbacks of him. the whole editing part was fantastic, I loved the technique of ""disolve"" during the film and the whole art direction how every detail is well made. the main idea of the film is important as everything else, clearly this is a movie of how a man becomes insane and how the nature makes a man go wild, it's like a string that pulls you into the jungle till you become a madman. and that is what coppola does best with the film, outstanding!",

It was extremely ambitious, and what you think of it really comes down to what you thought those ambitions were and whether you thought they were met. The original theatrical version had a couple of scenes missing, a scene with a French family at a plantation and scene where the boat catches up to the Playboy girls a second time at a fuel dump. The studio wanted them cut because the movie was running long, but without them you get a feeling that some story threads are left hanging. The director's cut is more structurally coherent and more fully explored thematically, but also longer and a bit draggy. The shorter version feels a bit more episodic and disjointed, which critics who disliked it when they saw it in the 70s seized on as a major flaw, but it really wasn't.

I have heard by many in my family who fought in Vietnam that ""Platoon"" does better at showing the experience of everyday life in Vietnam but that ""Apocolypse Now"" hands down displays the truest feelings of despair, hopelessness and loss that took place in Vietnam.

Based on Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS, APOCALYPSE NOW follows Army captain Martin Sheen into the jungles of Southeast Asia as he searches for renegade colonel Marlon Brando, who has gone native and frankly stark raving mad. Sheen gets far more than he bargained for when he finally finds Brando. Along the way, Sheen encounters a real cowboy of a lieutenant colonel played by a young Robert Duvall, who utters the film's classic line, ""How I love the smell of napalm in the morning."" Sheen had a heart attack while filming this massive epic in the Philippines. Frederic Forrest, a great character actor perhaps best known as the crazy military goods store owner in FALLING DOWN, has a plum role as the doomed ""Chef."" The film is absolutely amazing and can never be duplicated or equaled. Brando was in his glory as a larger-than-life madman, and Sheen justifiably became one of Hollywood's biggest stars after this.

I find this film to be a commentary on the dispute between Conrad-who set a meditation on the void at the heart of European society-in Africa and Achebe who found this an affront for the same reason; the Africa of the story is rather distant and the Africans shadows in the distance. Not only do the Europeans nick the continent off its rightful owners but they don't even give the locals a cameo appearance! This is reflected in the film where Vietnamese people exist to get shot or fall for Kurtz's not so crypto-fascism. By the last third of the film the action is in Willard's head-will he join Kurtz like Colby the first assassin-or do the suits' dirty work. He does neither-killing Kurtz allows Kurtz to expiate his sins and release the locals from their false God at the same time releasing Willard from his dependence on the suits for a ""mission"". By killing Kurtz Willard confronts his heart of darkness gaining the possibility to become older and wiser.",

And what's worst of all is that almost all of them are forgettable. No one can deny the power that Platoon had, but can you really remember much about it six months after seeing it? One month? That's the trouble with war movies in general. It's been about a month since I've seen Apocalypse Now (I've been busy), and I don't remember much about it.

After viewing it, I agree with that statement but I feel like it is much more. Besides just presenting the facts, Apocalypse Now takes a more artistic approach. The story is less realistic than other war movies (an American soldier gone crazy, forms his own army deep into Viet Nam.) Thats why I feel like even though it has a lot to offer about Viet Nam, it focuses less about the facts of the war and it's more about the story of Capt. Willard hunting down Kurtz.

Though the making of this film was a production nightmare from what I've heard, Francis Ford Coppola managed to create one of the most immersive and hallucinatory experiences of any film I have ever witnessed. The cinematography from Vittorio Storaro is hauntingly beautiful and euphoric. Watching Coppola's mastery of the craft here was an awakening to me. Martin Sheen delivers his best performance. He is very well known amongst cinephiles, but in my opinion he does not get the amount of appreciation he deserves. I'd put him in the same league as some of the greats. Speaking of some of the greats, Marlon Brando who though has a handful of minutes of screen-time his presence in the final act of the film was nothing short of compelling. ""Your an errand boy... sent by grocery store clerks... to collect the bill."" But what holds the film together is the themes it is depicting. The themes of duality, Western imperialism, and of course the descent into madness. How deep someone can go into their own psyche before they succumb to the darkest part of themselves. All of these ideas are expertly complemented by the aforementioned cinematic mastery from Francis Ford Coppola. In my humble opinion this is his best film and is of course one of my indisputable favorite films of all time.",

Coppola, takes you on an awe inspiring oddysey through the Vietnam war.  The dark frightening jungle, and the omonous river that snakes through it are amazing, and each scene takes you farther from reality and into a realm of madness. The movie takes a while for Willard to get up the river to meet Kurtz, however his character is so beautifully dramatized, I feel like I know him, respect him, and fear him before he is introduced.

Captain Willard is ordered to kill Colonel Kurtz, because he's gone insane and fighting the war his way.  As Willard ventures up the river, we get closer and closer to the insanity of war.  Colonel Kilgore attacks a village with The Ride of the Valkyries in the name of surfing.   A Playmate review is dropped into the middle of nowhere and sex starved soldiers go crazy.  A routine boat inspection turns into a nightmare and the Do Long Bridge shows the futility of protecting something that looks good on paper.  Once Willard arrives at Kurtz's compound, we begin to question what we've been told.  Is Kurtz insane, or is it the other way around?  Perhaps Kurtz is the only one thinking clearly.  We've seen things that do not fit into what we would think in a war.  A war brings out the insanity in the human soul.  The one pure action throughout this insanity is the sacrifice of the caribou.  Cut together with the termination of Kurtz, we see the meaning of Kurtz's words.   Apocalypse Now is not an easy film to comment on.  It takes time to examine, dissect, and reconstruct the film in order to come to a conclusion on what the film means to each viewer.

One of my favorite lines in Redux is when the crew asks Willard if he likes it hot while ditching the air cavalry. He replies by saying "" it's sure as ---- better than seeing what you can become in some factory in Ohio."" Willards journey into the jungle makes him start realizing how Kurtz the renegade colonel has been affected by the war into what seems like insanity but is clarity. "" Never get off the boat.

Marlon Brando is Colonel Kurtz the man who Willard is after, but before we ever get even near Kurtz, first we go through a series of insanely bright and colourful battles, live shows, a tiger and some fantastically chosen music to accompany you as well.",

The film makes the viewer think about what they just watched, by no means is it an easy movie to understand. It honestly should be placed higher up on the 250 list because of how fantastic the movie is. The soundtrack of the film is even better. The End by The Doors really ties into the ambiguity of the movie, as the song opens the movie and closes it as Willard murders Kurtz. Fantastic job by Francis Coppola, who in my mind is America's film wizard. By far the best part of the film is the interpretation of it.

Based on the novella 'Heart of Darkness' by Joseph Conrad, Coppola takes Conrad's tale of insanity, savagery and the darkness of man's heart, and brings it into moving life within the harsh reality of the Vietnam war. As I mentioned, Coppola delivers the unexpected. When the film begins, there is no John Wayne figure fighting a romanticised war, with the sun shining at his back. Instead we witness the breakdown of Captain Willard, a broken man, stumbling through the darkness of his hotel room, caught up in a traumatised delirium as he awaits the 'mission' that he longs for; setting the tone for the rest of the film, and Captain Willard himself.

Forget the ""Most disturbing film ever made..."" and the ""Psychological battle of terror"" kind-of-talk, we all seen that before and this film displays' it no better. But what is so outstanding is the godlike and jaw-dropping presentation of a mysterious Green Beret Colonel named Walter Kurtz, who penetrated to the farthest reaches of the Congo and established himself like a god. Where Coppola adopts a atmospherical surreal depiction of an extraordinary man, in a extraordinary place and in a extraordinary time. Kurtz is a decorated hero, one of the best soldiers in the Army, who has created a jungle sanctuary upriver inside enemy territory, and rules Montagnard tribesmen as his private army. What Kurtz learned is that the Viet Cong were willing to go to greater lengths to win: ""Then I realized they were stronger than we. They have the strength, the strength to do that. If I had 10 divisions of those men, then our troubles here would be over very quickly. You have to have men who are moral and at the same time who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill without feeling, without passion, without judgment."" Which the films also addresses, the lack of meaning and moral strive the american soldiers had in the war compared to other nations, while they fought for belonging and want, the american fought for ""the biggest nothing in history"". The whole movie is essentially that and Willard's journey towards an understanding of how Kurtz, one of the Army's best soldiers, penetrated the reality of war to such a depth that he could not look any longer without madness and despair.",

It basically gives us a more towering introduction to Kilgore's character, his surfing antics gone awry, the mission boat's passengers meeting up with the Playboy bunnies later on down the river when their helicopter runs out of fuel and a scene of war politics discussed at a French plantation where Willard and his men land.  Little extra pieces appear at other points as well and 'Apocalypse Now', the most surreal film about Vietnam ever made, shows that with the problems that plagued its production, it probably turned out better since the people involved in the production went through hell, just as the men who fought there did.

Adding nearly one hour of footage, Coppola turns up the insanity level, focusing not as much on the political commentary as on the surrealism of both Vietnam and his project. There's a greater emphasis on women this time around and Coppola's approach is surprisingly sympathetic: the USO Playmates have been driven mad by their surroundings (their pathetic sexual encounters take place at a forlorn, muddy outpost in a driving rainstorm) and Aurore Clement appears to the main character, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), as an angel of mercy (in perhaps the most astonishing section, a lengthy visit to a hidden French plantation). The scenes concerning Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) have been fleshed out somewhat but remain ambiguous and calmly ruminative, welcome and almost another movie in itself. Still, it's in the journey that Willard undertakes where most of the value can be found and Coppola's identification with the vivid dreamscapes make this a harrowing personal vision that lingers long after the film is over.",

Because filming during 16 months (that's almost a year and a half) in the Phillipines, during a war in that country, with a director on the verge of suicide and actors on the verge of breakdown will never again be tried by any sensible production company. A pity then, that we won't get another shot at something like this, but that's what makes this movie so unique. This is the ultimate example of how from chaos comes perfection. Everything about it is absolutely spectacular, and strangely crafted, considering the production conditions, which makes us think about what was the academy thinking about when they acclaimed ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" against this colossal masterpiece, only granting it two oscars. The redux version is one step further into this world and even if you only saw the film once with some attention, you will understand where are the new features, and their major roles here. Made in an era where there was no CGI, your jaw will drop in some shots, where more than 20 helicopters pass in front of the camera lenses, while a tank destroys a hut by the river, with thousands of extras running by. This was the ultimate challenge to the human resistance, and at one point in the movie, we no longer feel that it's only a movie. Its rawness comes like a near-documentary.

Frederic Forrest, Albert Hall, Sam Bottoms, and Larry Fishburne have some solid moments as the members of PT crew that take Willard in Cambodia.  It takes a while before the boat meets its destination where we find Kurtz's camp and surprise, an American pot smoking photojournalist is there to greet the surviving members of the PT crew and Willard.  The photojournalist is wonderfully played by Dennis Hopper who is also there like Willard to find out more about Kurtz.  Then Kurtz (Brando) himself enters the picture in a way that no one could have ever thought of at the time.  It does get bogged before I see what happens to Kurtz and it doesn't look pretty.

This film opens your eyes about the horror of war and what drives people insane. It also laughs at the idea of trying to call one action murder when everyone in this war was killing unnecessarily. This movie is shot beautifully and has some of the best action ever recorded. The focus is never on the action during action scenes, it's on the people. You'll often see bodies casually laying on the ground as if nobody is effected by it. This is extremely present when they meet the villain, but you realize there's no difference between the corpses at the Villain's temple and the corpses in the burned villages, the idea of calling murder of one justified and the murder of another evil is just not a line you can always determine in war. Every character does horrible things in this movie. Apocalypse Now has layers of depth and hidden metaphors that could be talked about for years.",
603,19 May 2012,manendra-lodhi,7, A take on war film from a different side.,"The tone of the film is very dark and might be a little depressing but only for some time , You find yourself wondering ,how the hell will he be able to complete his mission given the conditions. Well brando is a superb actor. But the film looked to be too long to me. I was fascinated after learning that the film went into so many problems. But even after the problems it faced it did came out nice and a definite one time watch. Martin sheen as captain Willard performed very fine and looked very mature at most of the times. The locations looked scary and haunting all the times , It escalated the tension at some times. The length could have shorter. Other than this it was a good film.",

608,23 September 2022,awvknj,6, Redux Reduced,I wasn't crazy about the original movie it's so dark right? It isn't I feel good movie in the first place and it wasn't a feel good war either - but I was curious to see redux and the scenes that were cut out -actually my favorite part of the movie is the plantation scene-- But when it was all said and done I really had a bad taste in my mouth at the end of this film ...and I am done trying to figure it out or spend any more time in that horrific time capsule... I could watch the Beatles Get Back for days but I don't want to spend days on the river with death. The film kind of pulls you in and repels at the same time perhaps that was what the Director intended in the first place.,
609,22 March 2007,freaky_dave,10, One of the Greatest War Films ever made,"There is not much more you can say about Apocalypse Now. Some people on the message boards are talking about which scenes in the movie affected them the most. Me, I can't name just one scene because there were so many. I'll name a few though. The first scene with Kurtz was memorable, the helicopters coming in to attack while Flight of The Valkeryes is playing is another. The Vietnamize boat where Willard ends up killing a wounded Vientnam woman after everybody on the boat with her has been shot by his group. The bridge scene and the utter chaos when we learn that there is no leader for those guys protecting the bridge. The tiger, the scenery. I can go on and on. That's because Apocalypse Now is one of those rare war movies that just sweeps you into the plot with its epic storyline and doesn't let go.",
610,16 October 2006,karl_consiglio,8, Far out!,"Personally I prefer 'Full Metal Jacket' but what I love about this film is that you have a guy who's come to the end of his sanity, the metaphor for which is the river. The spirit of this film is incredible though because it hardly mentions Vietnam, encounters with Vietcongs and battle but broader issues of human loss. It captures the surreal, psychedelic spirit of Vietnam. These are those cut off soldiers spending three sweaty years shooting at trees. Marlon Brando is incredible and im wondering now if the incredible tiger scene has anything to do with his presence coming up. He became that persona, it was already placed inside him, nobody else could have done that role so perfectly. Truly electric.",

612,18 March 2012,Artimidor,10, Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen between animal and god,"With ""Apocalypse Now"" Francis Ford Coppola transfers Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" tale into the 20th century and makes it part of the horrors of the Vietnam war. The result is a beautifully shot, highly suspenseful and entertaining movie, which can be labeled THE war movie with all bells and whistles in a scope rarely seen before in similar productions. Staggering cinematography, an excellent script, a crisp and vivid tapestry of sound and musical ambiance, the perfect use of location and of course the cast - with bit players like Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne or Harrison Ford -, all contribute to a cinematic event of the grand scale.",
613,19 March 2019,AleksandrBelenko,9, Post-Apocalyptic review,"Several days ago I watched this movie for the first time. The movie is a long lived classic, that I know as long as I live, but never was too interested in it. The version I have is is over 3 hours long. Currently holds #50 of 250 best movies with raiting 8.4. The review might content spoilers.
The movie has a slow pace narration, which feels even slower in director´s cut version. Though anyone who watched previous Coppola/Brando work - ""Godfather"" will find the pace comforting.
The music and the scenery ooze you into dark and terrorising atmosphere of war. There are no fun mments in this movie. Pure depretion. Either Americans bombard the natives or natives bomb Americans. Many scenes are filmed in the rain and moments of good weather are shown during thoughts of protagonist about his mission and war in itself. The lighter parts accompanied by presence of girls dancing or being naked, or guys talking about naked girls. That is understandable, the guys are soldiers and lacking female attention. But even those scenes are followed by unfortunate events in any way.
Yet again, the movie portraits the war greatly, in its unique way. The boat trip, so called adventure of the crew is full of struggles. Mostly moral. Author shows horror of war in his own manner. And then there is the scene of comming to native tribe by main characters.
Cambodians are portrayed as somewhat wild, uncivilized people, using straws, sticks and spears to kill Americans. That creates a dissonance as they live in ruins of great architectural value an aesthetic beauty.
We find out by some French photographer, that Cambodian tribe thinks of Colonel, as their father. Obviously, for the crew of newcomers he is crazy and evil. Willard plans to find the Colonel and finish the mission.
The main character is dragged by tribe members to Colonel, who asks him standart questions. And what he says after the place on Ohio river , the flower plantation, which leads to the speech about freedom.
That part is philosophic yet prosaic. They talk about Willard´s mission, if he is an assassin. So Willard responds to it, saying he is a soldier. Colonel says that he is neither. In my opinion that is the best scene in the movie.
Finally main character resolves his struggles by finnishing the mission. Or does he?
Overall it is a good movie. Slow paced during first half though. After watching this film I had a feeling as if I´ve read some epic novel.
How do I feel after watching the movie? How should I feel?
I definitely like cinematography, and the playing is good. It deals with psycological aspect of war and I enjoyed it as it is distinct to most of the war movies, that either show battles or spy operation.
I would like to say that it is great movie that is providing new perspective on war. As much as I enjoyed this movie during watching it, I will not rewatch it at all. No that is not that type of movie.",

I was born during the Vietnam War but do not remember anything about it. Watching this movie gave a me sense of what the war was like.

It was one film that got my father in law to open up his own experiences as a U.S. Army chopper pilot in country during 1967-68. I joined the U.S. Navy in 1977 and served with former ""grunts"" and ""brown water"" sailors. Every one of these individuals came back to the world a little messed up. It's one of my all time favorites; right up there with ""Platoon"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", and ""The D.I.""

Coppola went to the Philippines to shoot a movie with a partial script that would shape not just modern cinema but the lives of all involved in the production which became so infamous that it spawned its own equally compelling documentary.

621,30 August 2020,akashgandikota,10, The greatest war film of all time.,"Apocalypse now is the greatest war film and one of the great classics. It's themes and ruminations about society, war and the human psyche during the counter culture era resonate stronger than ever today. Francis Ford Coppola's daring vision is supported by excellent performances by the cast, grandiose cinematography and rich storytelling. One might argue that Apocalypse Now tries to do everything at once and that's true but it's also what makes it one of the most original films on war. The true measure of a great war film is not about making us root for one side against the other, it's about meditating on the nature of war and the human condition itself. Francis Ford Coppola does this astutely and masterfully.",

625,15 October 2005,bartverberne16,10, Apocalypse Now; This is the way the world ends,"Capt. Willard is sent on a mission in Vietnam to kill a man named Kurtz whose methods in the war became 'unsound'. Kurtz is a former officer who settled himself somewhere in Cambodia on the end of the Nung River, deep in the jungle. This film follows Capt. Willard on his seemingly endless journey on the Nung River that leads to the Colonel. On his journey Willard slowly becomes absorbed by Kurtz' life story and especially, his philosophy. Director Brian de Palma shows his true excellence in filming this trip; it is everything that film is supposed to be. It is full of tension and the dialogs are unforgettable. Not to mention the last 30 minutes of the film, which is to me the best ending to a film I have ever seen. When Kurtz (Brando) starts his monologue about the inoculated children, I sizzled. It was just great. The intriguing thing is that if you take your time to absorb the dialogs then you slowly start to comprehend what Kurtz had gone through. Apocalypse Now is definitely a work of art.",
626,4 July 2006,agmuradov,10, I love the smell of napalm in the morning,"I decided I need to lengthen up my review for my all time favorite film. Unlike other war films that focus on the event, Apocalypse Now takes the viewer into a psychological head trip. The sheer surrealism makes the body uncomfortable, yet you can't lay your eyes off of it. Based off of Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness, Apocalypse Now slowly descends its protagonist, Willard (Martin Sheen) into madness, most likely the same way Kurtz plunged into insanity. The production of this film is notorious for its delays provided by the monsoon season and for Brando's unprepared performance (he read his lines from cue cards). There is a documentary titled Apocalypse Now: A filmmakers Apocalypse which shows the hell everyone went through in making this.",
627,14 December 2016,siliw,9, Best movie about Vietnam War,"This is Coppola's best movie! Also this the best movie about Vietnam War! It is not only a normal war movie. There is something more hidden under those shooting and massacre. It uses a special view for this war. A view combines France, Vietnam, China and United States. Especially the shots for that French family. It shows a family living on the war and it lost their original meaning for living in the world. It doesn't have a safe place to go besides the war. Characters in this movie all looks a little insane. This feel of insane is not come from their original body. It is because the war, the war is the most efficient killing machine. It kills everything under its shadow. People who suffers the war and survives from the war can't get away from the war. That's the reason why post-traumatic stress disorder can't be cured until client gets well treatment. The most horrible thing is the killing from the war is invisible. People can't see it until them get blocked in it.",

629,11 April 2007,film_riot,10, Apocalypse Now,"From my point of view out of all the movies about Vietnam, and there is really a lot of them, this is the best. With its surrealistic approach, it goes a different way than the Vietnam films at that time did. A way that lets the viewer see the absurdity of war even clearer. A war like this can never produce anything good. Soldiers go (or have to go) to a foreign country, they see a culture, which they are not trying to understand, because they feel superior. That's what they have been told: ""We are the civilized modern humans, these are uncivilized savages."" The soldiers kill or get killed. And for what? That's what Marlon Brando's character General Kurtz means, when he says he's seen ""the horror"". ""Apocalypse Now"" is the most philosophical influenced Vietnam war movie with elements from many different genres, the horror film among them. A few words to the Redux version: It's a little bit less dark, a little bit less horror, a lot more of politics. It makes not a better film, but a different one. But still excellent.",

The direction, writing, acting, editing, and visuals are all very good. This is often called the best war film ever. I'll just say that is very high up there. The cinematography for the time was simply gorgeous. I think this is best shown at the end where the characters are surrounded by shadows, and there is light shining on their faces. It gets really good in those scenes. The characters aren't the most memorable war movie characters, but I can completely forgive that for the pure artistry going on with this film. Acting from this film is very good. The brutality it shows is very strong. This film is one of the best war films of all time.",

Its hard to realise how ground breaking (technically) and controversial it was at the time (due to its subject matter, but also due to cost), and how difficult it was to make.

The hidden message of the movie was the catastrophe that war war brings in the minds and hearts of men; the horror it creates and the disturbance it brings. 
A militarily superior country need not think that war is not going to harm it. It does harm all alike at the deeper levels. No matter who. War can only bring horror and destruction. It is the prostitution of entire races of men. It pays none, nothing.

648,20 April 2006,agreigboy,8, Such a great adaptation of Heart of Darkness,"It carries the tone of voice that narrates the book into the jungle of Vietnam and into the wild-eyed look of Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper and the mystical morbidity surrounding Colonel Kurtz.(I don't say Marlon Brando because after watching the documentary, ""Hearts of Darkness,"" I am skeptical as to how much credit Brando is due for that quality). The tone of voice I'm talking about is brooding and dramatic without being overbearing: ""Everybody gets what he wants. I wanted a mission, and for my sins they gave me one. They sent it up with room service."" It is indulgent without being narrow and alienating. A good example of is Hopper's indulgence into aphoristic madness, generously installing lines written by T.S. Eliot and Rudyard Kipling into his stony monologues: ""I mean, the man's a geniussometimes he'll walk right by you without even saying a word, and sometimes he'll grab you by the collar and say ""did you know that 'if' is the middle word in 'life'if you can hold your head while all around you they are losing theirs"" and then ""I mean he's a wise man, he's a great man; I should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas"" (The first one's Kipling, the second one's Eliot.",

The addition of the plantation scene plus the tragicomic ""Playboy bunnies"" trailer sequence and the outright laughs of the extended ""surfing"" shot just make an already classic film even more powerful. #34 on the IMDb all-time list?

Despite how Robert Duvall has only fifteen minutes of screen time, he is brilliant as a psychotic American colonel. He is by far one of the best parts of the film. Perhaps even better than Marlon Brando. I was very disappointed with Brando's contribution. He had little to no presence and was largely forgettable in his role as the film's antagonist.

This movie in my opinion Coppola's best among all other works including the Godfather' series. If you are a deep thinking person, this movie is going to hit you so hard. However, I would recommend reading the movie's based novel - ""Heart of Darkness"" - first before watching it. This movie is so deep and black in that it isn't a true war movie; it is anti-war and it shows you how dark and heinous a human can be in the state of war. The movie wants you to realize that war is more than just arms battle between people; war is about unleashing the true nature of human beings and that nature is brutish. So, it's more of a psychological and mental experience in watching Apocalypse Now.
I was also amazed by the performances of all the cast especially Robert Duvall. He was amazing in portraying that careless, dead-hearted Colonel despite having only less than 10 minutes of screen time. He deserved the Oscar so Badly!
However, I caution you that this movie is very underrated in that you either like it so much or hate it so much. There is no middle ground! It's a slow, mystic, deep movie that wants you to react deeply. So, if you are going to watch it for the first time, be prepared to get psychologically and mentally disturbed!",

Full of unforgettable scenes and images the first part might qualify as great cinema except for the need for a narration to make sense of the material - a sure sign of the mess the script was in as shooting began. Brando in the end manages to destroy everything with a mumbling, mannered wreck of a performance. If Brando had given Coppola one of his great latter turns in ""The Godfather"", here he gives the worst performance by a name actor I have ever seen. It stinks and anybody who tries to persuade you otherwise is deluded. Apparently Coppola was influenced by Herzog's ""Aguirre"", and certainly both movies are a mixture of the great and the awful, what lifts Herzog's film though is Klaus Kinski's performance. In my dreams I have an ""Apocalypse Now"" with Kinski in the Brando role -it's a much better film even though I'll never see it.

It concerns a U.S. Army assassin Captain Benjamin Willard, remarkably played by Martin Sheen in a haunting tour-de-force performance, who is given a hazardous mission upriver into Cambodia to track down and terminate with ""extreme prejudice,' a renegade officer who has gone insane, Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando in superbly effective performance, who leads his legion of Montaghard tribesmen on random genocide missions. The trip upriver becomes a mesmerizing odyssey full of surreal encounters. This brilliant film has some of the most amazing scenes ever filmed, like the famous Huey helicopter gunship attack on a Vietcong village led by Robert Duvall as Lt. Col. Kilgore in an monumental Oscar nominated performance for Best Supporting Actor. Kilgore loves to play Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" as his fleet of helicopter gunships bombards the villagers. Masterful Oscar nominated direction by Coppola that truly captures the hellishness and insanity of the Vietnam War, with staggering Oscar winning cinematography by Vittorio Storer, and a wonderfully eerie original score by Carmine Coppola and Francis Ford Coppola, and magnificent production design by Dean Tavoularis.

I could name 1,000,000 reasons why I loved it so much from the helicopter scene to the ceremony at the end of the film, but I couldn't name 1 reason why I didn't like it. I couln't tell you that this was just like Vietnam, but then the movie was not about Vietnam. It was about madness that drove one man to take the war on his own agenda and onother sent to eliminate him, but not before he slowly started to turn into what he was about to eliminate. The character developement not only individually but between each other seemed to increase as they went up the river. I rate this movie a 11 on a possible 10 scale",

As the movie went on it continued getting strange which made it difficult to pay attention; the movie lacked interest and depth so did not see the point to try to understand what was going on when I was not the least bit interested, if anything I did not like it one bit. Besides the strange plot and actions the message in the movie itself is disappointing. It puts down the war veterans of the Vietnam War making it seem as if they were more interested doing drugs and being crazy that fighting for their country.

Martin Sheen is brilliant inb the lead role and I particularly enjoyed the narration. My favourite scenes are towards the end with in a darkly lit temple featuring Sheen and Marlon Brando, who is stunnning in his small performance. His apparently improvised speeches left me thinking, confused and hooked which is likely to have been Coppola's intention for such a complex character. The supporting performances from Duvall, Hopper and others are also very good as well.

But such is the elusive nature of this endeavour, it never has quite has been attained in the history of film – well that's before a certain masterpiece going by the name of Apocalypse now graced our screens with this almost mythical alliance of this magnitude. The director: Francis Ford Coppola (Godfather trilogy). The story: a tale of a world teetering on the edge of Darkness almost ready to descent into primal madness, as Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) has to navigate his way through hell on earth to find and kill AWOL Col. Kurtz (The actor:) Marlon Brando (On the Waterfront and Godfather 1) - whose very name is translated into greatness in almost every language known to man. The epic tale of this coming together will probably never happen again or would even have another three components assembled that will ever parallel it. So it something to be marvelled at, as you sits down in your comfortable chair to watch such a spectacle. ",
736,14 August 2013,silva-w-pius,9, a tale of a world teetering on the edge of Darkness,"The one I watched first was the directors cut, watch the theatrical cut first.
The cinematography in it is dumbfoundingly good. Everyone knows the shot of the helicopters flying over the trees and the head above the water but the whole movie contains captivating and jaw dropping images.
I watched the directors cut, and as great as it was, I felt all 196 minutes of it very apparently. Not to be said this movie wasn't awesome however there were multiple scenes which I hope were cut out of the theatrical cut, because many of them were useless and unnecessary to moving the plot or developing character. This does work to the advantage though as it creates the draining and borderline insanity echoes by the characters, a slow descent into madness.
This is more a character study because of the weakness of the antagonist and the narration behind the movie. Marlon Brando does his best to bring the Colonel Kurtz to life but we spend so little time with him and the only thing we get before is he's mad. This makes the ending a bit anticlimactic as there's no emotional payoff even though we know this has been the mission of the whole movie.
It probably would have been a 10 but it was just too long with too many scenes taking you out of the movie which I would imagine aren't in the theatrical cut.",
737,6 March 2021,judemcrobbie,8, Watch the theatrical cut.,"This movie has many powerful scenes.  It deserves it's status as an American film classic.  However, I found the redux version way too long.  I felt some of the restored scenes in the movie took away from the flow.  Especially out of place was the scene where they arrive at the French plantation.  I think the picture does a good job of conveying the hopelessness and confusion that probably existed in the battlefield.  Duval's character was my favorite of the film.  His character's willingness to attack a difficult target was more inspired by his desire to surf on the beach than to accomplish a military goal.  I think that conveyed a sense of the way that some military decisions were made.  However, I didn't buy the Kurtz character.  I thought Brando's acting was great, but the situation of him forming his own little army to fight the war was too outlandish.  Oh well, certainly a classic, I think I'll take the original over the Redux, and I think I would have prefered a more believable conclusion.",

One example (another film made from a novella but far better done) was Death In Venice. I read Heart of Darkness as part of an English degree course and was too young to appreciate the novella at the time-it made its impact in later years. Eventually I watched Apocalypse Now thinking it would be equally good. Wrong. It was virtually unrecognisable. Another reviewer put it well when he said West Side Story bore more resemblance to Romeo and Juliet than this pretentious mish mash of pointless violence does to Heart of Darkness. As for Marlon Brando, he was as big a disappointment in this film as he was in The Godfather. So..the ""horrors of war""...""the thin veneer of civilisation"" so easily stripped away..nothing new, no depth. The worst horror was the slaughter of the bull. Tedious repetitive violence, presumably intended to be some kind of psychological journey. Boring, and I never want to see it again.",

I must admit, at the moment i am neither particularly lucid nor well prepared, but i found the redux version superior to the original release for several reasons, a few of which i suspect to be sound. Clarity. I am as much a fan of drug induced incoherence as anyone (a quick stroll through my other IMDbposted remarks should prove that); but the expanse of the redone film film with its little morality play Playboy bunny arc and Renoir homage French Plantation sequence adds so much moral weight to the vision that it is barely the same film. The 1979 version is like an acid trip, jumping from one great scene to the next where the mind spend much of its time trying to catch up. In the Redux version all scenes seem connected, everything makes sense, even if the sense is somewhat uglier than the original. To me the French plantation sequence is of paramount importance to establishing the gravity of the film as a grand indictment and not just a heady horror story with intellectual presumptions.",

745,18 September 2020,madrid-10834,10, AWOL madness,"Apocalypse Now is one of my favourite films and a great adaptation of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness to the Vietnam War by Coppola and Milius and under difficult circumstances and conditions there were exceptional performances by all the actors concerned. Coppola did a fantastic job capturing the whole physiological dimension of the Vietnam War, in particular, and all wars in general. The psychological and physical journey down the river, highlighting many of the aspects of the Vietnam War, including the distance of the generals from the war, commanders like Kilgore who enjoyed the war, the eccentricities and very different personalities of those involved, young inexperienced and confused soldiers, drugs, technology, the air war, the pointlessness defending of strategically unimportant places, the idea of no front lines, primitive and modern ways of fighting a war, the indigenous people of Vietnam, the politics of the war and arguments over how the war should be best fought, the conflict of ethics and civilisation, the humanitarian aspects of the war and the brutal measures adopted by both sides and a philosophical understanding of what possessed those to do what they did. The film also covers atrocities carried out by both sides, suffering of the civilians caught up in the middle of it all, and how powerless they were to avoid an acute involvement in the war. The movie also explores the idea of conditioning a soldier to go out and win battles but the difficulty of then asking him to only fight the war in a particular manner. The concept of the problem the army had with Green Berets, independent, intelligent and educated soldiers, allowed to operate on their own is also assessed. There is some disjoint in the Redux scenes, especially regarding the extra scenes involving the playboy bunnies as pointed out by some other submitters to this website. However, the French plantation scene provides a deeper insight into the war, comparing U.S. involvement with the French colonial war 1945-54, and showing the ghost like world in which the French settlers now live, neither belonging to France or Vietnam and is interesting from a post-colonial perspective. The French plantation scene also provides some continuity in the journey up the river and back in time, as Coppola wanted. There were also a couple of scenes from the 'Apocalypse Now  The Complete Dossier' which could have been including and may have cast more light on the characters in the film  'the tiger cages' scene with Kurtz and Willard and the 'Special forces knife' scene with Colby and Willard. The scene with Willard in the tiger cage while Kurtz discusses how he is prosecuting the war in a much more primitive and brutal manner in order to win at practically any cost, and Willard disagreeing gives a more in-depth insight into Kurtz and shows that Willard is not going to take the same path as Colby and join Kurtz. The scene with Colby and Willard gives a greater understanding of Colby's state of mind after he had refused to carry out his original mission and had joined Kurtz. However, he has not been completely taken over by the darker nature, and detached himself from his emotions, and he urges Willard to kill Kurtz and explain things to his wife and kids but unlike Kurtz's later request to Willard regarding his son, Colby asks Willard not to tell them everything. Although Milius sought a different ending, the ending Coppola decided on, the idea of the primal myth of death and rebirth, suggested by Denis Jakob, a friend of Coppola's was probably far more suited to the atmosphere and mood of the film.",

So yesterday, I got The Complete Dossiere from a mall. Contains the original film as well as AN Redux. So on with my review of maybe the greatest war film made for kids under 60 and over. Who wish that they are kids. In the movie, Dennis Hopper as the photojournalist(no name given), is as spaced out as Lance On The Forward Fifties. Lance has dropped acid during the long odyssey. The more the journalist talks about dialectics and different theories, it becomes quite clear the guy is ""out there somewhere"". But Colonel Kurtz is a little different in his mental state after losing it. The Colonel is dangerous. He has to be.. he has had too much training in the art of military strategics and tactical movement. I thought at one time what would happen if Willard had tried to bring the Colonel back to the U.S. Not a good idea. Throughout the trip to where Kurtz' encampment was, Captain Willard kept thinking the same way. This isn't right, he thought. Did not make any sense.

But some things catch my mind, as i wrote before, this movie really shows the words ""War is hell"". Not to many battle scenes in this one either (wich usually gets boring after 3 mins or so..), instead it shows how the soldiers lived and behaved under the Vietnam war. How they got mad and did everything to survive, the real hate against the Vietcong. Martin Sheen is great in this one. ",

From that statement it is not difficult to draw parallels between the film and the war it sought to portray:  both were long and costly; both began with a sense of purpose and ended with ambiguous, unsatisfying resolutions; and both displayed a surreality borne out of absurd imposed conditions that made it impossible to secure victory. This absurdity was aptly highlighted by Lt. Colonel Kilgore's self-satisfied statement, ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"".  It is not by accident that towards the end of the film, the mad renegade Colonel Kurtz read passages from T.S. Eliot's, ""The Hollow Men"". Without being specific, here a few from the poem:  ""Shape without form, shade without colour...Paralysed force, gesture without motion...Those who have crossed with direct eyes, to death's other Kingdom...Remember us - if at all - not as lost...Violent souls... but only as the hollow men...the stuffed men...In this last of meeting places...We grope together...And avoid speech... Gathered on this beach of the tumid river"" - (""Mistah Kurtz - he dead"" - 1925).

Apocalypse Now can't really decide what it really is. I saw it at film school, I along with many others was not impressed.  It is an action movie at sometimes, then it turns into some sort of half-brained morality pic.  Although some of the lines are good (namely Robert Duvall's Napalm Rant) and the cinematography is superb, the movie dabbles in too much other things to get to its point.

All the elements in this film help to wield the manic presence that holds the viewer until the release at the end, I can't think of any  SPOILERS to use with my comments, but it's my feeling that if anyone is reading this before they see this movie, it's a SPOILER enough. Martin Sheen is drugged, driven and excellent in his performance, Marlon Brando and the film makers were so subtle w/ his character's presence that some people can't sense Colonel Kurtz' engaging and deviation of Captain Willard, in which the Colonel saves the Captain from his doomed end. Watch and you will see that the Colonel was the sacrifice. This little theme, if I remember correctly, is what deviated this movie from Joseph Conrad's book.

The second scene (the tête-à-tête with the bunnies/hookers) is quite surreal and reminds me a bit of ""Catch 22"" ... it also explains why Chief Phillips is so bullheaded in frisking the Sampan (release of tension) ... The third added scene (the visit of the french plantation) is somewhat more difficult ... on one hand the dialog is highly valuable (seems like nobody is willing to learn from the mistakes of others) on the other hand the plot is not very credible ... personally, I would have put the scene at the very end of the movie, where the impact would gain more gravitas: once Willard takes a shower the dirt seems to be washed away, however the stains remain though invisible ....",

It wasn't until late 1979 that the film was finally ready for release. In the interim it was beaten to the nation's screens by ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Coming Home."" The trials and tribulations that Coppola's film faced on it's long march to completion are legendary and now part of the collective mythology of Hollywood. They included and were not limited to the replacing of leading man Harvey Keitel with Martin Sheen, problems with Marlon Brando, Sheen's near fatal heart attack, the constant rewriting of John Milius' script, the destruction of sets and the halting of filming after a series of deadly typhoons, monetary problems and of course the belief that Coppola might have been more than a little insane to tackle such a slipstream project. I mean it's not everyday that one attempts to adapt Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" while setting it in the Vietnam war. Apocalypse Now was gearing up to be one the biggest fiascos in the history of cinema. But all doubt was silenced in 1979 when the film was finally released.

787,31 July 2017,brandinscottlindsey,8," Vietnam, War, Insanity","The great film, Apocalypse Now, although certainly not the greatest American Film ever made, plays much like America herself (himself?). Coppola said during the film's premier that the film isn't about Vietnam, that is is Vietnam. He certianly could be talking about the native country he hails from as his creation almost perfectly captures the glorious imperfections that is The United States.Since I am only limited to 1000 words, I'll try and be brief. Like America, Apocalypse Now is: frequently pretentious and obnoxious, overbearing and white male dominated, carthartic and broad, bold and imperialistic, beautiful and yet unforgiving, mad, violent, loud and sloppy, over running with great ideas (some fullfilled-others half baked), exhilerating and mortifying, haunting and sentimental, holy and evil, deadly and vibrant, rough and cultured, exploitive and exposing, terrifying and harrowing, reverant and still extremely defiant, plentiful and thoughougly wasteful, independant and slavish, liberal and yet somehow conservative in its worldview,  and therefore, ultimately consistently fascinating and stunning. There has never been anything like it before or since. It is an experiment that no film maker will ever be willing to gamble with again in creating. Like a true work of art, this film is unique and one of a kind.Coppola's film reaches the hallmark of many great works of art- it refuses to allow the viewer to sit on a philosophical fence. Because the film is pure cinema in its use of visual and sonic images to tell a story, Coppola forces the viewer to react firstly emotionally to his narrative (the intellectual side can be engaged later if need be). One will either hate it or love it- there is no middle ground. This is much like the world's image of America as a country. Based upon the many mult-national contributors to this outstanding sight, my native country is viewed in those devisive terms. Based too on the many views of this film, the world is split as to whether or not this film is the work of a mad genius or an ugly prententious waste of time. In that respect, the only other film that comes close to Now is in fact Kubrick's 2001. For I can think of no other film that has split so many viewers. For this reviewer, Apocalypse Now is the film 2001 wants so desperately to be. Whereas, I find that film distant and cold, Now is exactly that: immediate and captivating.Now is not the work of a cold visual genius, it is instead the work of a fevered madman desperately holding on to his camera in an effort to keep himself from falling into the abyss. Based upon his career since, Coppola didn't stick to the high ground- he fell.Much like America herself in oh so many examples.Although not a perfect film, Apocalypse Now is a great film. It is the quintessential American Movie. A 10 out of 10.",

I have even allowed Ryann and Nathan (my kids) to view this movie with a sense of instilling them with the futility of so many wars. I am not a pacifist by any means, but I feel the underlying message here is still in the inner journey of a man torn apart by the insanity he sees surrounding his mission as well as the erosion of all values in humanity in each step along the way. Almost a sort of Dante's Inferno as he descends each step closer into Hell by moving upriver to his final destination. This is a very deep and complex movie.

Coppola having previously made a name for himself with The Godfather and The Godfather Part II takes us into war torn Vietnam and follows the story Captain Willard (Sheen) after he is assigned a mission to hunt down a former war hero now insane madman Colonel Walter Kurtz (Brando). Apocalypse Now in reality is a story of two halves and with many different themes throughout, the first being an insight into the horrors and brutality of Vietnam, the second a psychological journey of wits and strength to find and terminate the erratic colonel. Throughout the film we are introduced to a cast of interesting and realistic characters all affected by war in their own ways. Coppola presents his film on a grand scale with masterful visuals, stunning presentation and phenomenal special affects, with possibly one of the greatest soundtracks in film history. The Doors- The End fits the opening and closing scenes perfectly with both having similarly themed lyrics and music, as well as its beautifully haunting, primitive and climactic start, middle and end. Apocalypse Now also extends beyond a regular action-filled war movie with a huge change of pace during the middle and end of the second act, with even more interesting back stories, characters and themes. Apocalypse Now has a thrilling ending perfectly completing the picture and bringing a satisfying and conclusive end to an already spectacular film. The only flaws with the film are some relatively slow moments that do little to advance the plot and some minute comedy moments that take a way slightly from the scene and distract from the atmosphere. Apocalypse Now is one of the greatest movies of all time. 9/10",
805,10 April 2016,bscrivener-50810,9, 'The horror...The horror...',"This film is a masterpiece in the history of film-making. This is the film at whom, one of the best filmmakers of the 20'th century, had not made any compromise to external people - not to a producer, not to the US Military and not to the common opinion about Vietnam back in the 70's. Shooting of the footage began in 1976 just one year after the war so you can say this movie is a kind of authentic. Anyway this Film is notorious because of some immortal scenes. There is a lot of discussion about several scenes e.g. the whole ""surfing scene"" or the additional scenes of the redux version. I cannot understand people giving a bad vote because they don't like some scenes - maybe the most of them did not understand the meaning of the scenes they criticize. Anyway the film is a great metaphor it symbolizes the Vietnam War and the single scenes symbolizes the aspects of this conflict. The most conversant scene is the air attack to the village. To use Wagner's music is ingenious - these wonderful music and the senseless Destruction - the ultimate bafflement! These scene symbolizes the nonsense of war. I also liked the scene where the Boat stops at the the Brige to get fuel - it's a kind of surrealistic. I think it symbolize the abuse of drugs - anyway Lace was on drugs. There a lot of scenes that live on the Willard character. Willard is some kind of elite soldier but he is also crude and an alcoholic. The scene where he kills the girl show his coldness. It symbolizes the brutalization of war. Also the whole Kurtz character symbolizes the brutalization. My favorite scene is the end - where Willard arises out of the water, and also the scene where he sit at Kurtz's table and watch to the crowd outside. It symbolizes the dilemma of war.",
806,3 August 2005,razzbatzz-1,10, The definition of antiwar movie.,"Apocalypse Now, a cult movie, or rather, two cult movies. There are two versions of this film, a release in 1979 that lasts (already) 2:20 and a release in 2001 called ""Apocalypse Now Redux"" that lasts 3:15. I made a mistake, I looked the version ""Redux"". Why is this version available? 45 more minutes that do not serve anything, it's really stupid. Let us now turn to the film itself. The film is intriguing, we get into it, through a captain Willard played by Martin Sheen who is very good and endearing, furthermore it must be said, it's true that the attack scene with helicopters is mythical. The basic scenario of this film is good and it shows well the absurdity of the Vietnam's war and had better still show it in 1979 at the release of the film. However one begins to feel a film more boring and annoying a little after spending the two hours, the film becomes worse. And what about the appearance of Colonel Kurtz played by Brando who, when looking at the Director's Cut version, is expected for almost three hours? Disappointing, that's what it is, I was expecting something epic but no, it's just naught. Finally, after seeing the scenes that were added in the long version, I told myself that I would have appreciated much more this film in ""normal"" version, so I decided to note somewhat the two versions, the 2:20' version will deserve for me 8/10 when in the Redux' version, it does not deserve more than 6/10 for me, so, (8 + 6) ÷ 2 = 7/10, which makes Apocalypse Now a ""well movie"" whereas it could have been an excellent film without this Redux.

I think watching it a few times gives the same effect as having traveled somewhere several times. That 1 hour commute doesn't seem too long after driving it a few times. If on the first viewing, you find it to be totally boring, then maybe you will not even give it the consideration of a second watch thought I hope you do.",

Martin Sheen's character does not desend into madness as I think was intended - he is already there from the beginning.  I think the film would much more powerful if we saw this change in him as he got sucked deeper and deeper into the Heart of Darkness as the film progresses.  As it is, it is hard to identify with or relate to any of the characters.  I think some people like the ambiguity of the film, but I suspect that ambiguity stems from the divergent political viewpoints of the writers, Milius and Coppola, as opposed to it being carefully and purposely structured into the story.  Having said all that, it is quite an impressive piece of work.",

It was not only brilliant, it was courageous.  I cannot imagine what was going through Coppola's head when he axed the sumptuous plantation scene, but he did it, and, in the final analysis, the scene WAS superfluous and unnecessary to the story.  The encounter with the USO Playboy Bunnies was also dropped, mercifully so.  ",
810,5 July 2002,RHKLWK,9, Editing Achievement,"This movie is spectacular. It has a very basic storyline, good guy turn bad, new guy kill old bad guy. It's not that simple however, being that Sheen's character begins to question his command and start to go insane. The characters, although some are forgettable, are outstandingly iconic. Robert Duvall's performance as a bad-ass Colonel is extremely memorable, and Marlon Brando's portrayal of the main ""antagonist"" Kurtz is phenomenal. The soundtrack is also superb, using classic 60's-70's songs like ""The End"" and ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" but the truly memorable song is ""Ride Of The Valkyries"". However I DO NOT recommend this movie to anyone looking for an action intensive flick or a Full Metal Jacket-esque film. There is plenty of action in the film but it's main focus is the progression of Ben Willard (Sheen) in his reaching Kurtz (Brando). It is VERY slow at some points where we hear Willard's inner thoughts as he reads Kurtz's files. All in all it is the one of the most classic war movies and movies in general.",

It depicts how fragile the human psyche can be and how all our morals can be forgotten in a single moment of desperation. The metaphors used in this movie were incredible; the river was a genius way to show the character's sanity slowly slipping away and turning to pure desperation as they went further down.

Tavoularis has fashioned a convincing replica of Vietnam with an eye towards the shifting landscapes both of the terrain and the American infiltration of it; and Storaro's deep focus tracking camera captures all the verdancy of the land and the orange explosions that come to describe the sky above. The remainder is also impressive: Coppola, along with co-scriptwriter John Milius, has written a thoughtful, compelling visualization of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart Of Darkness"" and the conclusions they reach (that adherence to innate rules of combat is more moral than the civility of organized war) make sense in the context of Vietnam. The visuals don't capture the heartbreak of assault as fully as one would like (Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" would surpass it on that level) but it remains compulsively watchable even as it grows increasingly moody and reserved.

Now, with regards to the juxtaposition of elements you have to admit the music in the gunfight from cruiser scene (playing of course one of my favorites, Hendrix) is one of the best. I don't think it gets much better then that. From the story to the crude acting, to the editing, to the set location, this movie is number 1 in my books.

Robert Duval stands on the beach and talks about how he loves the smell of napalm in the morning. The helicopters are flying low overhead. The music they listen too on the way in. All these things create what is in my mind one of the best scenes in cinematography. Another thing I like about the movie is what a friend told me about an existential journey. My friend told me that you could almost watch the movie from the standpoint that Martin Sheen's journey to kill Colonel Kurtz was never physical but that it was an existential journey in which Sheen is trying to kill the evil that is currently residing in his head. After I watched the movie again from this viewpoint it was fascinating. Now I know that the writer and director(s) didn't mean for this but I still find it interesting.,

In a way I appreciated how it gave you a realistic view of what it is like to be a soldier in war. I feel as though it just got crazier and crazier toward the end and went on this weird path that totally left the whole first hour and a half of the movie. I didn't like how it dragged you through all kinds of crap just to leave you hanging with all kinds of questions unanswered. I won't even get started about the stupid buffalo or the dog. I thought there was a lot of great lighting affects and camera work that really made the film quite remarkable, however I wouldn't consider this a film that you can't go through life without seeing. Wasn't crazy about it, really wouldn't recommend it unless you're interested in crazy weird war films such as this.

I saw it and I thought it was one of the most thought provoking, yet disturbing depictions of not only war, but life. I will never see it again, because the effect is permanent. I had very high expectations for it. Not only because it is revered as one of the greatest films of all time, but because in this case: it's the director's cut. A whole hour of released footage, all packed into it. I have to say that the majority of it, it had an impact, even though some people viewed the original one as better, it had an impact. The opening scene is one of the most powerful openings in movie history, all the destruction, all the damage that we did in that country is beautifully depicted. Robert Duvall is definitely one of the major highlights of the movie, the reckless lieutenant colonel Kilgore, his performance is haunting, in the way of a man who was made for war, a man that lives and breathes death and destruction. His appearance is brief, but his effect is permanent. Martin Sheen gives a very nuanced, calm performance as the film's protagonist, the man that doesn't know what he's fighting for, which in itself is very a very compelling subject. And last but not least, Marlon Brando, makes colonel Kurtz one of the most compelling characters of all time (in my book), Kurtz is a world weary, manipulative and insane fascist. But at the same time, he knows his problems and he knows them well. That's what's compelling. But in the end, this is a war film best left for interpretation. I thought it was a well-made, staggeringly powerful, work of cinema.",

And that's the connection right there and maybe since Coppola was the first to beat around the bush of Vietnam, this movie was harshly criticized. I do believe he could have waited and maybe he should've waited, I don't know. However, I don't think it could've gotten much if at all better if he had waited but maybe it wouldn't have gotten harshly criticized. Although, someone could've beaten him to the chase and that's when you've lost it. I do believe the reason why Apocalypse Now was so well received was because it was the first movie to give real life accounts of Vietnam. Controversy creates criticism but it also gets you out and establishes you, whether you're perceived to be bad or good. What I liked most about Apocalypse Now was the visual effects in the movie. They were just dazzling and I think they gave the movie a gritty, disturbing (in a sense)look and appeal. I especially liked the latter half of the movies scenery/effects. I think it was probably generally disliked the first couple of years it was out. I think you just need to get used to it. Maybe 1979 was too soon or maybe it was just right.

The fact that a soldier had to go and eliminate a rouge commander, that was actually helping win the war, is just not that believable. Over all I thought it was a great film.

It's really one of the finest films around and is the Citizen Kane of Vietnam movies. In this film, with excellent camera work, an impeccably chosen sound track and legendary performances make for one of the greatest war epics of all time. Apocalypse Now captures the madness and terror of war, perhaps most perfectly in any scene not directly dealing with combat. The simple hunt for a surfing spot or the bizarre USO show scenes are more rattling than the movies' visceral gory moments. A viewer is inescapably left with a deep sense of unease and confusion throughout this film. Overall in my opinion, this is a classic Vietnam war film, and it is good, that is it's made well and it's an interesting story, but I didn't care much for it. Mostly because it's very slow, but that's part of the atmosphere of it, I guess. If you like Vietnam films, you'll like it.",

I hurried to my local theater, watched the film with great anticipation, and I was disappointed. While it was nice to see this great film on the big screen once again, the additional footage really speaks worlds for the editing process. Redux is a totally different film from the original. I admit, I was hoping the new footage would give us more of a look inside Kurtz's compound. There was some of that, but most of it was burned up with a visit to a French villa and time with the Playmates. And, strikingly, Willard becomes far too human. As it was originally released, Apocalypse Now is one of the greatest films of all time, a stunning commentary on man's need to dominate and control man, a psychological study of Kurtz and Willard, and a bit of anti-war sentiment tossed in as an aside. Redux, however, dilutes the primary messages of the original and becomes more of a ""horrors of war"" film, focusing on the war's impact on people of all types. Fans of Apocalypse Now who've never seen it on the big screen should see Redux just for the experience. As I was watching the film, though, I have to say that I was amazed by the artistry that knew that the deleted scenes should, indeed, have been deleted.",

For starters, it is a direct lift from Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", which is a short story that makes its points briefly and without fuss. It proposes to examine the disaster that was the Vietnam war, but takes forever to make its points, and then makes them with a bludgeon. It is a collection of setpieces and lacks a natural feel. It also features the worst performance Marlon Brando ever turned in. From the moment he appears on the screen he affects the movie the way a rotting whale carcass washed ashore affects a beach party. I missed the opening credits the first time I saw it and was shocked at the end to see that Harrison Ford had been in it. And for a final over-made point, listen to the code word Martin Sheen uses to call in the airstrike. That is not to say that there aren't some good things in it. The Philippine scenery was used well. Frederick Forrest was as good as he can be, and that little scene with the tiger is a gem. Robet Duvall was excellent, and the helicopter assault is one of the best flying sequences ever filmed, a real triumph of editing.

The Fading in and out of the character as you sink into his mind and thoughts is maginificent. Coppola does an amazing job with the fades of showing you the thoughts and aspirations or fears of a man in a war, he really doesn't enjoy being in. All of this is shown in one scene. Showing just how far of the lengths Coppola went to show the pain and endearing it took a person during the war in Vietnam. Coppola wanted you to be aware of the sense of the horror, madness and the overall moral dilemma of soldiers in the Vietnam war. The film depicts a group of U.S assassins and soldiers that need to clear out a former Colonel of the AWOL and while doing this they deal with the trials and tribulations of being a soldier at the same time.

Robert Duval does do an excellent job portraying a character possessed of all of the worst qualities an officer could have. There is absolutely no way anyone could reach the rank of colonel with such a personality. The sadness is that far too many think that those portrayed were typical of the US troops in Vietnam.

I remember watching them as a kid and becoming so influenced by them that I would pretend to be a soldier for hours and hours. I loved the action that were in these films and they always were able to hook me. However, when I watched the Redux version of Apocalypse Now there was something different about it that made me fall in love with it by the time the credits had finally started to roll across the screen. The fact that the redux version had been almost over three hours which is something I love to see in a film. For me that says that they wanted to be able to tell the story as long as possible without having to take anything out. Instead of watching an action filled, guns shooting, bullets flying war movie like with something like Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down. What i found was instead what to me seemed liked the psychological break down of a United States soldier in Vietnam. I won't go into any more details that could possibly spoil the movie for you reading this. If there was any film that you had to see this would be it.

If you want more realistic war movies from similar genre, there's Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill, Born on the Fourth of July.  The first 2/3 of Apocalypse Now is not bad at all, however the last 1/3 and ending were just littered with poorly thought-out, cheap B-movie production qualities.  Because this is a war movie, there obviously has to be a lot of dead bodies.  Well, the dead bodies all over the ground were all fresh and clean, as if they were all washed with soap and preservatives after they died.  Humans have buried (or burned) dead bodies for a reason, and yet the townsfolk appear to intentionally litter their community with the bodies of their dead victims (again, all clean and fresh) like expensive furniture.

A film that took more than two years to make that crippled Coppola's confidence as a film maker and rendered many of its stars ill health -- Martin Sheen suffered a near fatal heart attack and Brando was border line mad -- would have to be meritorious to justify its arduous developments. It was. Loosely based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Apocalypse Now is the story of a spiritually listless Captain Ben Willard (in a brilliantly understated performance by Martin Sheen) who is delegated with the task of executing the rogue colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has defected from the American establishment as the condition of a spiritual and psychological awakening. There have been numerous, and better, studies on the themes and popular significance of Apocalypse Now, so trying to encapsulate the essence of the film in a simple review would be discrediting it to say the least.",

874,23 August 2020,rajarpitara,10, A rewarding cinematic experience showcasing war and psyche.,"The first third of Apocalypse now is entirely grounded, and even the episode in which the ""wolves"" bombard a village is only a harmonic extension. After the task force's assault boat sails into the Mekong River, the film obviously gradually loses track of reality. It should be noted that the two American military bases on the Mekong River are definitely important variation points. The first was illuminated all night long, disconnected from the dark, ghostly river landscape, even though it was a building on earth; The base is well-ordered, well-stocked, and even entertaining, showy dances that defy the cold, bloody, irrational backdrop of war, with little humor and a sense of absurdity. The second base is under fire, but the film does not play a tragic atmosphere, but USES the vision and hearing of lance, a soldier who has been druzed. The explosion of ammunition is like New Year's fireworks, and the roar of guns is like the silver bell ringing in Santa's carriage. Everything is so wonderful and harmonious. But those who sink in the Waters of the Mekong river are eager to climb into the boat, which reminds us of the water ghosts in the Styx who are always crying and cannot live beyond their birth. As for the scene of Captain Lens water funeral, the combination of water waves and body under the setting sun is more dazzling beauty of photography, so I can only use the word ""holy"" to praise. In the last part of the film, the scene completely broke away from the bondage of reality, and the characters almost became symbols and metaphors in the hands of the director. The leading characters on the bright line and the leading characters on the dark line finally came into contact, just like the contact between the human self and the id hidden in the subconscious described in Freud's theory.

But so much time is wasted on such unnecessary factors, such as Brando's character development, and the Playboy bunnies who entertain the soldiers in Vietnam, a scene that seemed to come out of nowhere.

Amazing film.",
882,28 September 2022,Brandon_Robert_Kersjes,9, Spectacularly Different Each TIme,"After discovering that the running time for the Redux of Apocalypse Now was more than 3 hours, I dreaded watching it much like one might dread a 12 hour non-stop flight in Economy Class with no television privileges and male flight attendants while seated next to an overly chummy and flatulent overweight man named Huey who thinks that an arm rest is supposed to allow for the comfort of separating his monstrous ass cheeks from one another so as to avoid chafing... Seriously, that entire scenario played out in my mind. That being said, my love for Coppola, Brando and Duvall as a collective entity had been well and truly instated ever since The Godfather, as had my profound respect for Martin Sheen in light of more recent fare such as The West Wing and The Departed. Bearing all of this in mind, I was compelled to at least attempt sitting through this thing. I remember watching the original many years before the Redux and, while I found it compelling and provocative, it was probably not the ideal environment, and so I felt that watching the Redux was necessary. With that, I took myself downstairs to my small and wholly improvised home theatre, sat myself in a precarious position upon the edge of a beanbag and pressed play on the remote... Approximately 200 minutes later, as the final credit rolled, I suddenly became aware of a sharp pain in my lower back, and it wasn't until I laid back in the beanbag that I fully realized what had happened. I was instantly reminded of a small article written by actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, in which he recalled a visit to a local theatre as a young man to see Scorsese's Goodfellas. He remembered the film finishing only to discover that he was sitting on the very edge of his seat, much as he had been when the film began. ""I'm sure I meant to make myself more comfortable"", he writes. ""I guess I just never got around to it..."" That is the best endorsement I can offer for Apocalypse Now, for the original 1979 version and for the Redux. The film transcends its own frail medium, indelibly imprinting itself on one's memory as if it were some tragic yet revelatory personal experience. It may very well be responsible for more cases of post-traumatic tendencies than the Vietnam war itself! But of course, as anyone with dimensional grasp will explain (often condescendingly), this film isn't really about Vietnam, or any war for that matter, but instead how humanity is tainted and almost always permanently crippled by brutality, by immorality... by horror. The elements that naturally occur during warfare. Really, this film could have been set at any time or place (real or fictitious) in which the boundary between what is right and what is necessary is irrevocably blurred. Speaking as an Australian (and not in a way that condones any atrocious actions as ""necessary""), this film could have been made during the Stolen Generation period, with many liberties taken and altered to fit the context of course. But I suppose at the time for America, and for the rest of the world, Vietnam was the relevant component needed; it was, perhaps, even the actual entry point for the audience, the very element that they related with, despite the terrible emotional counterparts associated with it. It's redundant to say that the performances are spectacular; if you're at all a well-travelled film-goer, just a glimpse at the cast list should give you an idea. Complaints will and effectively have been raised regarding the two longest additions to Redux, being the intervals involving the Bunnies and the French Plantation. Over-analysis is a practice designed for the very purpose of robbing art of its intangible beauty, so to speak too much on these scenes would kill them. Suffice it to say that I myself was entirely befuddled with these additions until the final moments of the latter, in which a character says to Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), ""There are two of you, don't you see? One that kills, and one that loves."" Think long and hard on that in relation to the film. I think it's probably one of the best inclusions Coppola made. How about you?",

What follows are unnecessary scenes and slow pacing. Most shocking was that they arrive at some base with a huge show. At that moment I was thinking: What the heck was all that stuff about travelling with their boat and that big fight in that village when they could just have flown to that military base with the show??? Afterwards they came in some half deserted base where to those Miss july's etc. are holed up. What are such national celebrities doing in run down base that do not even have normal tents?

887,19 May 2018,somebodyyy,4, Nostalgia speaking,"This definitive collection (the final cut disc set) of one of the best films of all time, the psychedelic and intense Vietnam war film Apocalypse Now. Like director Copplla said in a press conference...this film IS Vietnam. This edition consists of the recently assembled ''final cut""...which is somewhere in length between what was the Redux version and the original 1978 cut. I find it a little more fascinating and gets a little more in depth about the journey and mission martin sheen's character gets involved with. It's the best of Redux really. It also comes with regular 1080p blu ray versions along with the fantastic unique behind the scenes documentary from 1991 called Hearts Of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse. I would rate the 4k visual presentation at 4 out of 5...the elements used in the transfer to digital are a little faded and I suspect multiple sources of film elements were used to make the final cut. However the cinematography of the film is so strong and well lit that it really overshadows any generational loss or fine details issues. The use of neutral density filters in the shooting of the film is prominent and the hdr color and wide contrast reproduction is vivid and blends beautifully. What is much more amazing is the work that went into the surround sound remix for this release. The low end pulses rather dramatically and deeply and the high end fidelity is penetrating. The use of The Doors' ""The End"" song in the infamous dazzling opening shots/scenes are so mesmerizing and spacious that it gets right deep into your brain via your ears and vibrations through your spinal column. This film is reputed as one of the best sound designed films and it's true. It's one of the only films in existence whereby you can listen to the film with the visuals/tv off and still be able to get the story of the film in great detail. It's a testament to pure artistry and psychology delivery via ia editing of sound and picture. This goes with Thanks to the ultra genius craftsman of film overall, Walter Murch. Get this if you are a fan, or just curious. It's a rare perfect movie thats immersive- delving deep into morality, 'tripping out' and of course, madness. #apocalypsenow #4kcollector.",

The story is very thrilling and captivates the imagination so that you can really feel the heat, hear the sounds and even smell as if you were there yourself.

This results in a film morbidly shocking and gruesome on the surface, while at the same time being subtle in its strangeness, with the latter ending up being more disturbing than the gore, and both nevertheless just as impressionable as one another while sharing an epic scope.

But , the whole scene with the French family is too long. The dinner scene is very unnecessary for the movie. One of the biggest reasons why I think the redux version is not as good as the original is because of kurtzs voice in german. I'm german, so I watched it in german, and I think the original has one of the best german synchronization of all time. Kurtzs voice actor does a brilliant job (in the original) . The voice sounds mysterious and scary. But in the redux version, there's a new voice actor for many characters, including kurtz . The new voice sounds a bit to soft. And if you watched the movie, you know what's said at the end: the horrors , the horrors . And the in the original version of the movie, it sounds wonderful, but in the redux version it isn't the same anymore. So , I'd give the redux version a 9, 5 out of 10 rating .

The supporting characters are the real gem of this venture: Besides Duvall, of course, there's Jerry- the creepy taciturn CIA operative, the Playboy bunnies, Hubert de Marais- the French plantation patriarch, the 14 year old Larry Fishburne as Tyrone Miller, Frederic Forrest as Chef (shoulda been nominated for supporting), and last but not least, Albert Hall as the Chief, Surprisingly, Brando was the worst part.",
905,10 February 2003,camselle,10, CHARLIE DON'T SURF!!!!!!!!,from the very beginning of apocalypse now you can tell that there's brilliance involved. after martin sheen punches out the mirror it officialy becomes brilliant.  Martin Sheen along with lawrence Fishburne and dennis hopper and even a younge harrison ford in a cameo role turn in great performances.  Marlon brando performance however was not brilliant i believe he could have done some things differently.  Let me just say that coppola is perhaps the 3rd greatest director of all time and turns this chaotic war film into a masterpiece and a personal favorite of mine.  apocalypse now however is not for every one and could be taken as offensive to the unaware. so with that minor warning i recommend this film to all.,

It is a remarkable experience because you feel in the middle of it all with Capt. Willard and the young guys going upriver.  (This is NOT always a good thing!  It's almost overwhelming.) The dinner scene at the French plantation doesn't add much even as an explanation of the War.  The Playboy vignette, while not seeming exploitive, just doesn't seem to work.

Martin Sheen's performance has always been undervalued in this film - he is the heart of the movie, as he his dragged further and further into the nightmare of Vietnam - he is a professional solider, a special forces officer but even he is overwhelmed by the chaos caused by Kurtz in what was the hidden war on the Cambodian border.

918,6 January 2003,tonebone,9, near cinematic perfection,"""Apocalypse Now"" could very well be considered Francis Ford Coppola's ""Hells Angels."" Quite possibly anything that could have prevented the film to continue shooting happened. In the jungles of the Philippines, people got sick, people got hurt, and people got sent home. The story of ""Apocalypse Now"" is that of pure insanity. In the beginning of the film when Martin Sheen (Captain Willard) is dispatched by some higher ups in the army to go on a secret mission to assassinate a renegade Colonel everyone is relatively sane. As Coppola's epic film progresses and grows, so does the insanity of everyone on the boat taking Martin Sheen's character up river. Deeper and deeper into the jungle they go, the further away from ""society"" they get and the more primitive things become to them. Starting out with modern warfare such as napalm, planes, and machine guns quickly turn into rocks, arrows and spears. Willard narrates most of the movie as he reads his mission briefs or scouts upcoming bends in the river. Set on his mission Willard keeps in mind what he is after, thus making him more immune to the disease of insanity, whereas, his shipmates have no idea why they are going up river and what they are getting themselves into, hence why they start to lose it before Captain Willard. When they finally reach the camp of Colonel Kurtz, they find that the natives love him and his wisdom. Mostly because they probably haven't been subjected to such power before he came along. By the time the deed is done, Willard has become so immersed into his character of this guy who is suppose to kill this other guy, that he is completely unfazed by what he does and walks slowly back to his boat and goes home.",
919,4 October 2008,Maximus975,8, comment,"Apocalypse Now still leaves me with the feeling I've just had a dream that I can't remember. That feeling that something special happened, but I have no idea what. Here are a couple case in points. The air assualt on the VC village, the Playboy Bunny dancers, and the river boats cruising past the downed B-52. I remember the plot, but something about the pacing seemed like it was part indulgence, part burden. Writing this doesn't clear up what I'm thinking. My problem may be that Conrad's, ""Heart of Darkness"" is a moody work, and the moods in this film seem to have blunted what Vietnam was reported and recorded as for mass consumption. An artificial construct like Apocalypse Now requires more nimble story telling. The character study of Kilgore was great, the surfing inane and perfect. The image of the helicopter carrying the cow in a net doesn't get any weirder, but it was like looking a paint pallet. The story needed to be blended better. It's tough to say how, and maybe Apocalypse Now is a true product of it's time. As developed a film about could be 1979, but still too imersed in the culture of the time to get past itself and on with the story.",

It undoubtedly has the best cinematography, and it is home to many of the most famous, brilliant lines in film history. It is a true shame that not only did this film not take home the Academy Award for Best Picture, but it has come to be a come when one can open up the TV Guide to see the title listed in the movies section with only three stars beside it. Martin Sheen jump-started his career with this epic masterpiece, and he was astounding. This film does not fit into any one genre. Many people consider it to be a war movie, but I strongly disagree. This film is a deep, moving drama, which could have been set at any time in any place, without changing the plot. Like many other great movies (The English Patient, Cold Mountain), war is an effective back-story, and it is used surprisingly well (I am not a fan of war movies at all). The most masterful thing about this film was the brilliantly effective choice of playing 'The End', by The Doors to open and close the film. I think that the opening and closing scenes are among the most memorable scenes in cinematic history. The entire cast is excellent, the direction is indescribable, and the cinematography is destined to blow all of its audiences away. This movie put the epic in masterpiece. The thrilling conclusion, where Willard (Martin Sheen) assassinates Kurtz (Marlon Brando) can be interpreted in many, many different ways, to the extent that one could stay up all night debating with his friends over the topic and not reach a conclusion come morning.

949,15 November 2006,wmarkley,6, A Few Great Moments but Many Poor Ones,"The plot is fairly simple and brief, adapted by Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness. Martin Sheen plays the role of Captain Willard, a war-torn character who does not see any hope in life or humanity anymore. He has a mission and it is to capture a presumed Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has fabricated an army of existensial soldiers on the outskirts of the Cambodian jungle. Throughout the film we encounter astonishing sequences. The most unforgettable is the dawn helicopter attacks. Robert Duvall's character Colonel Kilgore is a steady and firm example of the basic American army brain: to search and destroy and then destroy some more if it includes yourself. The children walk about the playground, oblivious to any danger. The helicopters come into view from the dawning sea; millions of sprinkle reflect from the water, we hear the helicopter's engines roar from the horizon and soon enough we are stuck in a messy attack. Throughout the sequence we hear Wagner's 'Ride Of The Valkyries'. It is method filmmaking. The starting sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie; a beautiful scene of palm trees blowing in the ragged wind and seconds away from being inflamed with a carpet bombing. Let's not forget the scene where the soldiers of the boat in which Sheen travels in, stop an innocent upcoming boat, suspecting them to be VietCongs and carrying artilleries. Then they spark off a heavy scene of shooting in which all of the passengers of the boat are pulverised to pieces with their crops and food savaged in the atrocity.",

I would suggest to everybody that enjoyed this movie, to read this story. It's not very long, about 80+ pages, but well worth the time. Reading the novella actually increased my enjoyment and understanding of the film. Obviously, the film is ""loosely-based"" on the novella. The time period, setting and circumstances were completely different in the film than in the story. Coppola, and the screenwriters, however, managed to capture one of the most important aspects of the story in the savagery that exists in the jungle and the effects it can have on the human psyche. I found Marlow's growing fascination with Kurtz in the book to be an interesting parallel to Willard's , played by Martin Sheen, fascination with the colonel. As both men travel up their respective rivers, getting ever closer actually meeting the man that inspired the admiration and obsession in both of these men, they come to start to understand the reasoning's and methods to their respective Kurtz's insanity.

A mission that involves killing an insane and deranged Colonel (Marlon Brando). With a great secondary cast which contains great modern day actors including Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne, Harrison Ford, Dennis Hopper, and Frederic Forrest. Each actor in this movie shows outstanding talent, I was simply awed by the performance in this. Mainly what this movie portrays is the insanity war can make you experience. This film captures this in the best way possible, each character shows this in a different way, some of the minor characters such as the playboy models even show how insanity effects them. But the effects used in the film and the music in the background play a an important role in creating a certain tone for the movie, in which Jim Morrison does an amazing job at. The Doors song, The End, showed insanity and brutal mentality in it which played great in the film. Even as an opening song saying The End was a very clever and very entertaining aspect of the video.

Then Brando bows his head, dips his fingers into a bowl of water and flutters his fingertips along the skin as if playing a piano or celesta. Sheen's boat and its two-man crew glide very slowly into the tiny cove which serves as Brando's main port. The place looks like mannequin factory. There are bodies and body parts strewn about. Bodies that are more or less whole droop from the trees and from the gargoyle monuments that surround the entrance to Brando's dark and beckoning castle. Hundreds of half-naked natives with spears and guns have assembled in silence to greet the boat. Out of this unholy horde dances a crazed photographic journalist, the ever reliably crazed Dennis Hopper. He shouts greetings, shakes hands, welcomes them warmly, but adds in a wary tone, ""They think you've come to kill him -- and I hope THAT'S not true.""

Of course, if there is any resolution, its in the journey and each time I re-visit hoping that maybe this time I'll figure out something more. Brando may not have been trying his hardest in this movie, but he was given an almost impossible task at the end. In roughly 2 and a half scenes he had to hold up almost 2 hours of unbelievable hype and suspense. Almost any other performance could have sunk this movie or (maybe worse) rendered it conventional.

991,14 April 2006,fimerc,10, Goof,"Apocalypse Now is quite possibly one of thee greatest films ever made, and definitely a masterpiece.  Not only does Coppola depict the horrors of war, he also examines the savagery which is at the heart of all mankind.  Coppola does not show the horrors of war the same way most war movies do.  Saving Private Ryan used gruesome visuals and intense drama.  Platoon attempted to show the interaction between men, and their loss of innocence.  Apocalypse Now is much more creative.  The creative approach is perhaps shown best in Roert Duvall's character, Lt. Col. Kilgore.  Coppola uses the humor of this man who is so obsessed with surfing, he attacks a village primarily so he and his men could surf there.  This was an incredibly creative way to show how a man can become so insane while not becoming detached from relationships with other people. Beyond the depiction of war, Apocalypse Now attempts to show the evil that is at the heart of every man.  This is not necessarily to say that all men are evil, however, it is saying that all men are capable of such evil, and are often attracted to it.  As the men travel further and further down the river in the movie, the things they see become more savage and insane, as well as the crew itself.  So, in essence as they travel further down the river, they travel further into the evil heart of man.  This is the main theme behind the short story which the movie was based on, ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad.  The end of the river is the culmination of all evil.  A display of what man holds inside him and what he is capable of. Apocalypse Now is less of a war movie, and more of a journey into the heart of evil.",

If you're blind, you should at least give it a three for lines like ""I love the smell of Napalm in the morning."" and so many others I can't recall.At one point, Capt. Willard is in a trench at night with two young soldiers at a machine gun, one firing and yelling obscenities. Capt. Willard asks him,""Who's in charge here?"" the guy on the gun turns around and says, "" Aren't you?"", and then, immediately goes back to shooting into the darkness. Did I say at least a three, I mean at least a five. Five plus five is ten. You should give it ten if you aren't blind, ten at least. I gave it ten.

Now, because of the ""Redux"", the movie is again getting a lot of good press. I watched it again, both versions, with my children. We all agree that the film is just boring. The scenes are wayyyyy too long, the action moves at snail pace. The philosophy behind the film is very contorted, sometimes unclear or very plainly confusing. There is actually very little to praise about this movie, apart from the score (especially the Valkyries during the chopper flight) and Marlon Brando's very unique acting style. I do not recommend this movie as an example of good cinema. I really do not consider this movie, especially the current ""Redux"", to be up to Coppola.

There are powerhouse performances from Sheen, Duvall and Brando. I think the sound and narration are perfect. I can't think of a film where a narrator has blended the story so seamlessly.

In forcing us to reconsider the justification of military intervention into other peoples' cultures--and especially in light of recent U.

Although disturbing, the film is a reminder of what happens when we blindly follow the ideology of a dominant elite that falls prey to its own rhetoric.

So monumentally gargantuan in scope, this picture effortlessly handles the taboo topic of the hidden, dark side of mankind.  Each character is a pleasure to watch from Duvall's over-the-top ""Col. Kilgore"", to Brando's broken, life-weary ""Col. Kurtz"". They all demonstrate a facet of humanity that sometimes brutally displays the utter beast that lies deep inside of all of us.  As far as a ""War"" film goes, it is TOTALLY untouchable.  Films like ""Deer Hunter"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", and ""Platoon"" are all great, but fall short of the greatness that ""Apocalypse Now"" has acheived.  ""Full Metal Jacket""'s first half (the Marine training at Parris Island) is stunning and flawless.  Soon after though, it treads into territory that damn near noone can relate to.  Not everyone is a killing machine like ""Joker"".  You may say that noone can relate to ""Kurtz"" but I seriously doubt that given the same circumstances, you would not be questioning the very fabric of humanity the way he does.  In ""Platoon"" we are faced with incredible force, and great story, but muddled dialoge, and a sense of aloofness in our main character leave us at bay.",

I get the sense that the director has taken the story and translated it into the context of his life, then translated that into a collective modern context that would make the connection comprehensible for us.  Ultimately it is an exploration of that hidden secret connection between good and evil.  Is evil really opposed to good, or does it just think it is?  Is evil, ultimately, merely a part of good, something that acts to produce it, test it, bring it out?  What is the PURPOSE of evil in the world?

He also encounters many ruthless characters including an officer called Kilgore (Robert Duvall) who launches a napalm bomb attack on a beach so that one of his men can go surfing.

1024,12 November 2003,Shocky,7, A Flawed Masterpiece,"In the introduction to the most recent version, Apocalypse Now: Final Cut, Coppola refers to the surrealistic tone of the film and its avant gardist vision (that Vietnam turned capitalist?). But I wonder if a more apt description of its underlying esthetic is that of a surrealist homage to Dadaism, and rather long-winded at that; because the only firm opinion I could draw from viewing it this third time (my previous viewings were its predecessors), was that it was basically informed by a nod, intended or otherwise, to the absurdist elements of art as they pertain to film, with form prevailing over substance in a very spectacular fashion. Ironically, it was this latest version with its enhanced visuals and sound reproduction and effects that drove me to this conclusion, I guess because the narrative paled even further next to the ramped up audio-visual sensory experience, bringing out all the holes and glaring inconsistencies. One could argue that the absurdist element is a broad metaphor for war, in this case the Vietnamese war, but for a film that sets out to meticulously fill in the character of Kurtz the renegade Colonel through the eyes of Captain Willard the Special Ops assassin, both of whom one would assume have an inkling of the role of the US Military in the American Military-Industrial complex (Willard even refers to it as 'the Corporation' not entirely euphemistically), the received plot summary that Kurtz, having discovered the military isn't interested in winning the war, violating his principles as a warrior and a patriot, has gone insane and formed his own rogue army in the jungle of Cambodia to impose a reign of terror on those trying to depose him (one assumes from both sides), just doesn't ring true. For a Harvard grad with a Masters in History and member of the establishment, one would expect him politically savvy and cynical enough to know that war is business by other means, and that's it's not necessarily just about destroying the enemy and winning; or to paraphrase R. West talking about the military of the Romans: 'They had no use for the local potentates which would build up the Empire by raising their territories to military and economic strength; they wanted it as a defenceless field of exploitation for an international army.""",

It is a modern-day Epic using the classical conventions of Homer to tell its story. From the opening chords of The Doors ""The End"" (which is a miniature version of ""Oedipus"" amongst other myths) we are given clues of the films epic aspirations.  All the elements are here:  The feeling that we enter a story in progress, like the Odyssey which begins on the journey home after the ten year war, helps to create a sense that Willard (Martin Sheen) has fought his physical war and is ready to move on to war with his self.  The unmistakable sense of journey which is snowballing toward an inevitable conclusion. And the obstacles faced by Willard on his journey, his nervous breakdown in the beginning of the film is like a battle of the Gods within himself preparing him for the next step of his life's journey, Kilgore (Robert Duvall) is the Cyclopse, the Playboy Bunnies are the Sirens, and the Dolong bridge is like the River Styx, the entrance to Hades, the point of no return, the screams from the fog are the Furies always in chaotic flux voicing their alienation, and Col.

I cant say which aspect of this movie i think is the best, because they are all just great. The cinematography is the best I've seen in a movie so far. When you see the beautiful scenes of war or just jungle and river in Vietnam, you will know why. The fact its been shooted on Philiphines probably helps, but Coppola is the one that made it so great. The actors: unforgettable Marlon Brando as a disturbed commander Kurtz or cinema legend Martin sheen, acting is at the same level as other aspects of the film. The script is amazing too, as well as sound and colors. But the best is what this movie has to say. Just like Coppola said:""this movie isn't about Vietnam, it is Vietnam"". This is not a movie about war, if you see it as a movie about war, you should see it again because you just didn't get it. Its about people and human nature, its about madness. The book movie is based on- The Heart of Darkness- is set in Africa and river Congo, and I think that Vietnam is a much better setting.

He must find a man who was once a great American fighter who was in the Special Forces, but unfortunately began to lose his mind and became the leader of a murderous colony. The commanding officer is clearly distraught by the fact that he must slaughter one of his own people, and not just an American, but a former soldier. Benjamin Willard and his group of men are forced to deal with many situations as they arise and not everyone makes it out alive. Many scenes show the disturbing factors of the war and utter insanity. Underneath the general story line is an intense transformation of the men over the duration of the film. It provides an inside look at the journey into darkness the men must face. It has a contrast in moods through the movie because at some points it shows the chaos and the torment caused by the war, and other times the setting is bright and everyone is smiling and joking. The film establishes many moods and settings through montages and long shot pictures.

It sounds strange, but I think that it's beautiful in all its madness. Everything in this movie says important things about the insanity in war and how cruel its influence on the involved persons is. Just Willard's inner dialogue tells that he is getting insane about the war. The people who surrounds him, Kilgore and the people on the boat, are all insane, brainwashed by the war and Uncle Sam, and Coppola is showing this desperation in a perfect way.",

The film ends up being equal to the novel in complexity and expression, making it a rarity in Hollywood.  The imagery is ugly and sobering, but Coppola gives it a mythical quality which lends the violence an odd form and purpose.  Overall, an excellent film, regardless of how disturbing.",

Apocalypse now is an outstanding piece of art. This movie left me so shocked, I could'nt stop thinking about it for like 2 weeks after I saw it. Fantastic director - Coppola had to work for almost three years to end this epic story about a few american soldiers that are sent to destroy their own general Kurtz. The group is led by Captain Wilard who is performed wonderfully by Martin Sheen. This movie is like so much different than everything else i've ever seen. It deals with the crazyness of the war in vietnam, and the sanity of the american army. The movie is directed in an outstanding way by coppola, and is acted brightly by all the leading cast. The photography is just unbelievable by Vittorio Starraro. And like Coppola once said: ""This film is not about Vietnam - it is Vietnam"".I say this film is not about being great - It is great!!!",

On the surface the movie is about Vietnam, but as it progress' the title Heart of Darkness seems easier to understand. Apocalyse Now shows the effects of the war more than the war itself, along the same line and The Deer Hunter. With an over-all dark and disturbed tone this film is not for everyone.

1079,18 July 2022,mustafakayanioct,10, GOLD FROM FRANCIS COPPOLA,"Well, I happen to think so.  I tend to judge films on their emotional impact and I've never seen another film that is as viscerally involving as this one.  The film actually gets more disturbing after multiple viewings when you know what is coming.  Then the awful events loom over you instead of sneaking up on you. The film has a flimsy plot which it derives from it's source material, Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness.""  While it employs the structure of Willard's boat journey up a river to find Kurtz it employs it to different meaning. Conrad's novel was a deconstruction of colonialism but Coppola's subject is war.  But he famously said, ""My film isn't about Vietnam.  It is Vietnam."" Coppola's film isn't really interested in the specific politics of the Vietnam War.  The extent to which it is even really a ""war"" film is debatable. Truffaut said it was impossible to make an anti-war film because film by it's energy tends to argue for war by making it seem exciting.  This film uses that fact intentionally.  The horror of war is brought home to us not by our witnessing it, but by our taking part in it.  Apocalypse Now's technique is to create an anti-war film not by having us critique war from the outside, but by involving us in the actual thing itself.  We are forced to confront our own heart of darkness as a result.  We must look within ourselves and see how we would have reacted in the same circumstances. What is the meaning of war?, is the final question of the film.  The film has come under criticism because the ending does not provide a tidy resolution for this theme.  But the resolution is the arc of the entire movie.  When we get to the heart of the darkness at the center of war we don't find any answer that is expressed in intellectual terms.  That is the film's ultimate message: war is not a product of our intellect but of our deepest human nature, our human heart of darkness. Do you think yourself the master of your own heart of darkness?  So did Kurtz...",

He's well supported by such acting heavy weights such as Marlon Brando and Robert Duval who both portrayed their characters superbly. It gives you a different outlet about the Vietnam war, this film wasn't just about action scenes as is so often the case with war films that i have experienced. A Bridge Too Far and The Deer Hunter are two other war films of this generation.Its easily better than A Bridge Too far and is as good if not better than The Deer Hunter. It gives you a better portrayal of the Vietnam war than Deer Hunter, i think I've just got a soft spot for Robert De Niro. To summarise the film, its one mans(Martin Sheen) journey across the river and through the battle grounds of Vietnam and Cambodia and he has to conquer his fears and obstacles that try to prevent him from completing his mission. My only criticism is that i had looked forward to seeing more of Marlon Brando, who was magnificent in the film just a shame it was quiet a brief appearance really.",

It's almost 3.5 hours long. That just causes WAY too much pain on the ass (-1). Visually it's amazing (+2), sound is amazing (+2), acting is amazing (+2), the story is just SO intense (+2). My favorite scenes will always be with the Surfing Air-Cav (+2) featuring Robert Duvall. Again the credits were handed out as a flyer, tho this time there actually was a reel of credits at the end. You can tell its out of place because after the final fade out there is a copyright statement in the bottom left corner. Similar to the copyrights you see on photographs. There still are no opening credits. I wont go into what the movie is about. It's not professional, but I'm not getting paid. I will note a couple things. The movie is as intense and shocking today, as it was 22 years ago. The story is the same, with a couple key development scenes restored. These scenes add a little more humanity to the boys on the boat. A couple of the scenes are humorous, and one brings our assassin to earth. The best thing about this film is the recurring theme of the film: The chaos and insanity of war. Almost every scene starts, how ""it should"" be, normal, then through intensity and/or chaos everything goes to hell. Pretty much what war is like. The moral issues that are brought up follow this cycle of destruction.",

Suffice to say everyone came out of the cinema fairly shattered e.g. none of the usual happy gossip. This film is a masterpiece. I have to disagree with some reviewers who thought that the French plantation scene was unnecessary. I thought that to have a French perspective on the war (after all, they'd been there, done that ! )  added a lot to the story. Superb in every way. My only other comment, if you are in your twenties, for instance, make a date for yourself to see it again in whatever format will be around in 20 years time. This really needs to be seen again when you are older and when, I believe, you can get so much more out of it. No doubt a provocative comment, but it sure applied to the two of us tonight.",

I enjoy a well structured story more so than plain violent entertainment. This film provided a balance between both very well. The only question I'm left with, what is ""the horror""? While I love a good ol' open ending, this left me craving more. Marlon Brando's performance in the final stretch of the film was absolutely brilliant. I appreciate every aspect of a good film, but for me, good acting takes the cake. The violent yet realistic depiction of Vietnam added so much emotion to the plot, and depth to the characters. Is the horror the war? Is it the military? Is it the civilian brutality? Is it the burden of living on with PTSD? There are endless possibilities. Truly one of the best war films I've seen.",

At first the film starred Harvey Keitel but due to arguments with Coppola he was fired. Then Martin Sheen was hired for the part and later on had a massive heart-attack. A typhoon also ruined the film's production and set them behind schedule. Also Marlon Brando arrived at the set late to admit that he never read the ""Heart of Darkness"" and was overweight. Coppola even threatened suicide a couple of times and lost 100 pounds while filming.

Martin Sheen does an excellent job of acting. Robert Duvall who plays Col. Kilgore is my favorite character.  Francis Ford Coppola created a masterpiece although had trial and tribulation that almost killed the movie several times while filming.  This is a film that you can watch many times and get something out of it. If you own it (it is a must have for any film library) the urge to pull it out, dust off the cover and slip it in the DVD player will strike every 6 months or so.  This film can not be fully appreciated without a home theater with surround sound.  I have viewed it several times in plain TV mono/stereo.  The 5.1 surround turned it into a whole new film!

The use of music in this movie is another astounding and contributing factor, Coppola picked variety of soundtracks, ranging from The Rolling stones to The Doors, and it gels beautifully with the narration. ultimately, this is a very daring, realistic piece of art, something which is totally absent in today's world of cinema. Watch it for Martin Sheen's effortless non-dramatic performance,Coppola's surrealistic camera-work, The Music-which gives this film a slight psychedelic feel, and of course MARLON BRANDO-You could give him virtually any damn role and he would nail it right out, that's Brando for you.

1098,5 October 2009,Scherzonoid,10, the ultimate classic,"When I watched this film for the first time at a reissue screening of the Redux cut, I was utterly devastated because of the never ending destruction within this picture. Everyone seemed to be dead inside, lost in fear and regret, gone crazy because of the experience of unspeakable things. I pitied them so much and learned to dislike war for what it is - it only causes devastation in any respect. Later I watched it again and again and still this film puts some kind of a spell on me. It took me some time to figure it all out. Well, there is this outstanding cinematography which I could never enjoy again in this quality. Combined with the editing all the pictures are more like music, very sensual and very attached to the characters' feelings and notions. Somehow a lot of the story is told by the images whereas the music is more subtle and only underlining what the images try to tell you. When it comes to storytelling, this film is very classical in a sense that we just follow Cpt. Willard's descriptions and we can only learn what he knows. So after a while we become his mate and begin to judge the things from his perspective. Well, he does some questionable things and we still do not know if he is really reliable, so we keep distance all the way. Finally, we are attracted and repelled by his weary appearance all the way, so here comes the suspense from. Really nice technique to keep the audience focused on the plot. Furthermore, the cast is incredibly talented - actually they do not even act in this film. They become as real and authentic as anybody. Due to their performances I felt like I was on this very boat, I was scared with them and I was happy for the mail to arrive. Maybe this is the great and outstanding nature of the film: That it feels so real. There is not so much deception in it - as a matter of fact everybody was in the jungle, everybody was fighting a little war there and everybody seemed to despair of their deepest horrors. I reckon that is what the film is all about: What we are looking for lies within and we cannot cover up what we are with shams and lies. To my mind this is film making in a very purified manner.",

Not only does it offer a great screenplay, the representation of the screenplay is flawless. Martin Sheen's character is well- developed. Even young actors who were still launching their careers, like Laurence Fishburne, did great performances. Marlon Brando's screen time is the only thing that bothers me about the whole movie, but it's just because I wanted to see more Marlon Brando in it. But the decision to keep Marlon Brando's screen time restricted to the movie's penultimate is completely understood considering how they wanted the story to end. This movie is the next in list to show Francis Coppola's directing capabilities after The Godfather. Thanks to his directing, every performance, major or minor, was spectacular. There are already close to a thousand reviews to the movie pointing out its great aspects, but I still wanted to leave a review of why enjoy this movie.

It features possibly Brando's best performance as the almost god like Colonel Kurtz who despite not appearing in the first half has a powerful presence throughout. Duvall's performance as Kilgore is also noteworthy for summing up the insanity of war in one character better than some films. But it is Sheen's narration that hold the epic together as his character just like the viewer attempts to understand the madness and senseless destruction happening all around him.

1110,17 April 2018,johnnybladescud,10, Apocalypse Now is not only the greatest movie ever made ever it's both a masterpiece and a masterwork of extremely behemoth proportions,"The film ""Apocalypse Now"" is quite possibly the greatest war movie of all time. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, and starring Martin Sheen, as well as the magnificent Marlon Brando, Apocalypse Now is the epitome of what a movie should be. Coppola sets out to show what war does to minds, to nations. He succeeds beyond the scope of what anyone could expect. You are immersed in the story, the characters' problems become your own, and by the end of the movie, you may never look at the world the same way again. This movie is tantamount to scarring in regard to how well it imparted its message. ""Apocalypse Now"" is the story of a psychotic quest by Sgt. Willard (martin sheen) to find and kill the renegade Col. Kurtz. (Marlon Brando). You follow his footsteps, as he immerses himself more and more in the hunt for Kurtz. At each obstacle you see more and more how disenfranchised Willard is becoming with the war. Finally, near the end of the movie, you what happens when Willard finally does find Kurtz. This is not really a movie about war; it's a movie about people. It subtly portrays how people act in a hellish situation, how their environment forces them to adapt, or sends them spiraling into insanity. One example of this is a scene where Willard makes a stop at the Do-lung bridge. The bridge is under attack, but no one can tell where the attack is coming from, and no one on the American side know who's in charge. This is representative of the war as a whole, because it occurs toward the end of the movie. In the beginning, The American presence was efficient, clean-cut, organized. By this point, the last American outpost on the Nung river, The Americans are shell-shocked and almost crazy. This shows quite effectively the course of the entire war. ",

But that fact makes absolutely no difference in this movie because the visuals are filled with so much intensity and mood that it is impossible to miss Coppola's point about war. The episodes are each stunning.  My personal vote for most awesome sequence in any movie ever is the Ride of the Valkeries helicopter attack.  Robert Duvall is genius in his role as an air cavalry colonel who picks his targets based on the quality of the surfing in the area.  He at one extreme fun loving and at the other lacking humanistic qualities altogether.  As absurd as it sounds, you absolutely believe him when he says, ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning..."" All the other performances are top notch including a good debut for a young Laurence Fishburne and solid, dark yet sympathetic presence from Martin Sheen (even though he suffered a heart attack during filming).  Once you have experienced the grandness of this surreal war film, I highly recommend renting ""Hearts of Darkness: The Making of Apocalypse Now""  This Oscar winning documentary was shot by Coppola's wife and paints a vivid picture of what an awesome undertaking Apocalypse Now really was.",

Coppola achieved the essence of the American spirit, risk taking, deception, and egotistical nature we all have in our souls.  But the real credit for the power of this film must go to the greatest civilization of all time; the Greeks. If this film's foundation is not rooted in classical Greek mythology I don't know what is.

1116,30 December 1998,DWR-2,10, Greatest American Film ever made!!!,"What most commentators and critics overlook about this film is that it has encapsulized in one film the entire political scandal that we have come to know this war as.  It is a microcosm of the tragic scandal the U.S. was involved in S.E. Asia for almost a decade.  Martin Sheen (a military intelligence officer) is hired (by a general and an ominous looking civilian) to kill a ""hero"" officer single-handedly responsible for multiple victories in a region considered a ""no man's land"" by other general officers.  During Sheen's journey he encounters ""druggie"" enlisted men, ""cowboy"" helicopter warriors, a government sponsored ""girlie show"" where drugs are trafficked by a quartermaster. Sheen is escorted by a boat crew that includes a fellow with the initials ""L.B.J.(!)"" who is responsible for every bad incident that is encountered. This character, L.B. JOHNSON (get it?) even remarks ""This is like DisneyLand!"" and of course he remains unscathed to the end. Sheen, upon completion of his mission, has killed a prolific American officer, destroyed his military escorts, crushed his own allegiance to the U.S. and has his host's village ""bombed back into the stone-age""... A fairly good microcosm of the war.  Oh, and by the way, the character ""LBJ"" is the only person other than Sheen who survives the film.  Look for a brief cameo of a young Harrison Ford in the first 15 minutes of the film.",

The acting was unbelievable.  Sheen was great as a military assassin.  The first scene in his hotel room was brilliant.  While we don't really know what makes his character tick, he is so interesting and walks the thin line between reality and insanity.  Duvall and Brando are just as good.  The scene where Duvall and his crew take out the beach (so that they can surf is fantastic). Duvall is so arrogant and the satire of his role is illustrated perfectly by his performance.  Brando was, well Brando.  So majestic and powerful.  He was exactly how I pictured Kurtz being.  Dennis Hopper also does a great job in a small role.

1136,25 December 2008,Fuzzdoggg_tripleG,8, A world of its own,"Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 Apocalypse Now, is a Vietnam war story that is focused around an Army Captains trip up a river to assassinate a rogue Colonel. Martin Sheen is Captain Benjamin L. Willard who has been tasked with the assassination of former Green Beret Colonel Walter E. Kurtz played by Marlon Brando. Captain Benjamin L. Willard is escorted up the Nung River by Chief Phillips (Albert Hall) and his Navy patrol boat crew to carry out his classified mission.
This film has a very strong upside from the point of directing, editing and producing. Francis Ford Coppola maximized the effectiveness of lighting, colors, and angles to produce a cinematic masterpiece. The natural light and darkness often add to the effectiveness of the characters while providing a connective touch to the viewer. Francis Ford Coppola's introduction is unusual and quickly grabs the viewers' attention. The open starts without introduction or credits. Instead, the slow-motion action of helicopters and napalm bomb fires in a jungle setting is set in rhythm with music of the The Doors. The scene begins to fade-out/fade-in with Captain Willard in a room. A ceiling fan and the blades of the helicopter are used to create a smooth transition. Similar techniques and the same music are used to close the movie as Captain Willard slays Colonel Kurtz in the same fashion as a cow is simultaneously being slaughtered nearby. 
Though I believe this movie is worth watching, it does have its downside. The movie is very cryptic throughout and can be very slow at times. It is not a Vietnam war movie along the line of Full Metal Jacket or Platoon, instead, this movie is more artistic and may keep the viewer searching for a deeper meaning.",

""Apocalypse Now"" by the legendary, Oscar-winning Francis Ford Coppola is the best depiction of the Vietnam War. It is pretty obvious onto how a dedicated soldier could meet his ""breaking point"" at that time. Honestly, being in Vietnam, fighting the Communists, and experiencing torture for 21 years is brainwashing. There is a tremendous amount of symbolism toward the famous lines in the film, which are ""The Horror. The Horror."" and ""Terminate with extreme prejudice."" Yes, ""Horror"" has a face. But it does not need a friend because it is ""Horror"". Kurtz is seen as a god because he is a friend of ""Horror"". Very respectfully, Willard is mainly the only man in the war to not have the same downfall as Kurtz's and the other soldiers', may they rest in peace. ""Extreme Prejudice"" is self-explanatory, but it means much more than killing an insane traitor. Although America went out to give Vietnam a helping hand, specifically the Southern Government, there is ""Extreme Prejudice"" towards an American who becomes close with Vietnam. Except, Kurtz became WAY TOO CLOSE with ""Horror"" and even a god with a ton of clever morals in ""lIFe"". That is why Willard must ""Terminate Kurtz with extreme prejudice."" Even though a Frenchman said that the Vietnam War is ""the biggest nothing"" in American History, the Vietnam War is not ""the biggest nothing"" in American History because A. the man is French and B. there were plenty amounts of American casualties in the war. Personally, I am a Mexican American and 17 years old, but very patriotic. Other than WWI and WWII, I would enlist in the Vietnam War. Hopefully, if I ever become a doctor and WWIII breaks out, you can definitely, without a doubt, count me in. Reason being, there is no greater feeling than serving for a cooperative, great, and respectful nation.

1162,25 January 2019,jmoschossismanis,6, An overrated movie,"Apocalypse Now"" was originally 200 hours of footage shot in the Philippines over the course of 16 months. Director Francis Ford Coppola was responsible for funding several million dollars for the film during financially difficult times. On the set, the cast faced many set backs, including the destruction of sets during the monsoon season and the fact that helicopters that they were using to film with were called back by the government to be used in actual combat. Marlon Brando appeared on the set overweight to play a character written as noticeably underweight. Brando also had not read the script or the novella that it was based on and after receiving a million dollar advance, he at first refused to film. Martin Sheen was an alcoholic during shooting and during an opening scene of intoxication he is actually inebriated and his actions were improvised. He also suffered a life-threatening heart attack on set. During the filming of the movie, Coppola faced financial difficulty, marital strain and mental deterioration. Throughout filming, he threatened to commit suicide on three occasions and lost 100 pounds. Following the completion of shooting the movie took an additional year to edit. However, despite setbacks upon release the film grossed over 100 million dollars at the box office and earned two academy awards for best cinematography and score along with six other Oscar nominations.

When Brando's character asks sheen's character who he actually is, sheen replies by saying that he is just a soldier to which Brando says. ""You're just an errand boy sent by the grocery clerks to collect the bill."" In th film Col. Kurtz was not a rouge officer. He was just someone who had hung his boots on war as he could not bear the horrors of it. His unit followed him which caused an upset for some high ranked army people back in the U.S. War was important for them no matter how horrendous the outcome was.

Movies that showcase units of soldiers fighting the war are a far more accurate representation of modern-day war. Although mercenaries are necessary in some scenarios, they are not practical for a great majority of operations. Also, the military would never send a lone mercenary to take down another. Perhaps a unit of Special Forces, but never a separated person with no way of reporting back to the base. However, in the case presented in the movie I can see why it might be necessary. One of the most deadly personnel of the military completely at home and integrated into his environment might require a knife in the back.

1197,22 January 2004,cclip,10, The film with the GREATEST photography in history,"One of my favourite films. Let's get that said and done with and not drag on my personal love for it like so many reviews do. For anyone not getting the reference, the summary depicts both my love of the film, and the constant orange glow that simmers through this film. Francis Ford Coppola has created an incredible adventure of the mind, which parallels Capt. Willard physical and mental journey to find and 'terminate with extreme prejudice' Col. Kurtz. One can watch this film with many frames of mind, in which you can draw upon politics, barbarous acts, war in general, a man's state of mind, and even military family life. But putting all aside is to witness a man execute orders given to him by his superiors, with the help of a small naval crew, along a treacherous river in Vietnam. Martin Sheen should be commended more than he has been, which is difficult when he becomes overshadowed by 3 amazing performances by Brando, Duvall and Hopper. But Sheen is brilliant too. Some may not see him as a Captain who could've carried out some of the tasks he has been accredited (secretly) for, as mentioned by his superior Colonel Lucas. But it's more a state of mind that Sheen has to portray in Willard's character. Which I should say is what I believe to be the most important factor of this movie. The mind. Willard possesses the ability to achieve what none of the predecessors to his current task could. Whether or not the brilliant crossover images that Coppola uses in this film, such as the fire burning in the head of Willard near the start, are intentional, they certainly sat right with me. Coppola of course, had to overcome the overweight Brando problem and transform his movie. Boy are we glad he had to now. With the help of Brando, they created the core of this movie. Kurtz' 'demise'. Despite the lack of screen time for Brando, you feel his presence. Of course, we see pictures, and hear recordings, but we are nowhere near him. Yet you feel you get closer, and not just physically, as they travel up the river. Aside from all the war politics that come with Kurtz' new found philosophy, the words are not just all about war. I believe that the essence of this film comes from many aspects, but importantly, the dialogue, and script. As if written by Hunter S Thompson, we are taking an acid trip throughout the movie. Jumping from fear, to comedy, to brutality, to philosophy, and even to Playboy Bunnies. I, as I'm sure a lot of people are, am glad the Redux version was released. As Coppola states, it gives more of the immediacy, horror, sensuousness and surrealism of the Vietnam war. We see Coppola as a director within the movie, which shows a surrealism in itself to the act of war. Especially the Vietnam war. Despite the peace loving belief of people that all wars are unnecessary, this one may well be one the most famous wars that should never have been. A quote from the film as 'the biggest nothing in history'. A lot of morals can be gained from this film, and at many points (as a member of the military too), I see comparative instances in how the world works. For instance, the 'terminate with extreme prejudice' I mentioned earlier, is delivered by... A civilian. This then transcends to superior officers of our main character, stating the 'insanity' of the subject of this mission, but do they, or would they ever understand? They just want the problem dealt with. Governments and Military (not forgetting the vast majority of general society) find it difficult to appreciate the thought process of man when one figures out that there is more to life than politics. 'The horror... the horror'. Despite the fact that Kurtz admits his mind has drifted down river, and that he wants Willard to do what is necessary, the key link is the Photo Journalist. Hopper as mentioned earlier, plays a fantastic role in this film, and to me ties up all the aspects of this film into one. Philosophy, beauty, fear, and also drug appreciation. The latter is made obvious by his characters personality, but the others are entwined a bit tighter. The beauty aspect is the fact that he is a photographer. He wants to innocently capture the events of this war, and now especially, the incredible transfixion of Kurtz' 'putting the world to rights'. His fear is noticeable in two senses; one physically, but more intelligently, the fear that Kurtz won't be understood when all is said and done. This to me, is the nail being hammered in. Fear is all around. Willard has to end this some how. Like I had stated earlier; he has the mind-set, for both mission, and ultimately, Brando's awe-inspiring bald 'joined the SF at a strange age' Colonel. My favourite personal viewpoint, from a quote related to Willard's mind through this journey is Kurtz' question.. 'How far do you live from the river?'.",

Extraordinary.,"There were long periods of the film in which I was wowed by the brilliance of the cinematography and the spur-of-the-moment decisions from Coppola. When the movie finished, I felt as if the final half-hour let the film down. However it is the final half hour that, for the past seven hours since finishing, I can't stop thinking about. There is so much symbolism and hidden layers to everything that happens that I'm both excited to watch it again and terrified. All I can say to you is that Apocalypse Now is for two hours an extraordinary film that jumps from a fast- paced, balls-to-the-wall action film to a slow-moving war drama faster than it jumps scenes. The final act, however, will leave you twisted, confused and unsure of how you feel about the film as a whole.

My rating for this movie is actually a 9.5 and that is just because it does not include any crazy unexpected twists, or any interesting philosophical themes like every other of my Favorite movies, but I guess that the lack thereof is just a testament to Coppola's directorial capabilities(I'm not a Godfather fan by the way, I liked the first one but I did not love it).

Supporting Sheen in the movie was Marlon Brando, an eccentric Dennis Hopper, a young Lawrence Fishburne, and Robert Duvall (who provided the often quoted line ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning!"").

These are the many adjectives that can be used to describe this monument of cinema. The Redux version, extended for about 45 minutes, was fully supervised by Francis Coppola for the 20th anniversary of the film and to its operation on DVD. The reintegrated sequences do not distort the original version of the film. We have more playmates, more madness and especially more Brando, for the Kurtz's character benefit. Only the sequence of the French plantation (30 minutes alone) is a questionable digression because it depicts the French so naive and causes a break from the narrative. The film, supported by a director prey to megalomania, was brought forth in pain. The sets were ravaged by a storm. Helicopters lent by the army of the country where the shooting took place, were requisitioned to fight when turning the aerial sequences. Lead actor Martin Sheen, drunk all day long, had a heart attack. The director gave her tray for a whole week for a romantic extramarital under the eyes of his wife who was incorporated in the technical team. Time and budget were so happily overwhelmed to the point that the production company of Coppola, Zoetrope, went bankrupt and the theatrical release was compromised until his selection at Cannes festival with a emergency montage.

It was nominated for 8 Oscar nominations and succeeded in 2 of them. At that time it was probably one of the best pictures of the decade and today it's considered to be a masterpiece of cinematography. It's not a surprise that nowadays it's in the top 45 best films of all time.,
1209,9 October 2015,ijericho227,10, Mind apocalypse,"What a complete revelation when I saw Apocalypse now! It helped me to change my opinion about the Vietnam War radically. Of course I already knew it was one of the most traumatic episodes America has ever experienced, but I could not think of such brutality in conflicts, such hypocrisy of politicians and such deteriorating effects war has on the human psyche. The plot is basically very simple and brief: Willard, an officer who has lost any hope in life and humanity, is sent on secret mission to kill the renegade colonel Kurtz, who has set up his own little society in the jungle. However, it is so much more than that: it is the Willard understanding of how Kurtz discovered the reality of war to such depth that it drove him crazy. The feature also offers philosophical analysis on war and soldiers conditions. ",
1210,15 February 2015,tiphaine-guillet,9, A revelation,Most may not know that corporate America has seat at the table with other who coveted the natural resource potential of Vietnam thus arranged came to financed of the weapons while the French the meat for the war as far back as 1945. CARING FOR THEIR WOUNDED and public awareness proved too difficult to maintain and justify. The dialog and feel of this great piece is well just an eye opener of U.S. puppeteer-ed ways and means. Making 911 a cake walk for the golden goose to war with more of the same but enhanced management to follow. What is this an anti war film or hole in the curtain where a thin slice of events and were manner governance is attempted.,
1211,29 March 2015,sumfooltu,9, relevance of/for todays events,"Apocalypse Now is probably the most disturbing film I've ever seen. During the Vietnam war, the main character Captain Willard is given a secret mission : to kill General Kurtz who is presented as a man who became insane and actually is settled in Cambodia. Unlike other war films where the main characters are lively and dynamic, Willard is expressionless. But still, we become attached to him as he seems to be the only one not to lose his mind in this war, may be except for the end when he brutally kills Kurtz. Throughout the film, Kurtz is seen asa goal and Willard learns progressively about him as he goes up the Nung River. Little by little he wonders about the meaning of this mission. It shows how soldiers go blindness to war due to order from superior. More than that, this film shows in a general way how Americans used heavy artillery in a war where they did not have their place. For example with the famous helicopter shooting scene quite shocking because accompanied by the lively music ""Walkyries"" by R.Wagner. The music plays an important role all along the film for example putting us in a agonizing atmosphere when soldiers go crazy. I liked it when at certain times there were Rock music (The Doors, The Rollings stones). This put us in the mood of the end of the sixties. To conclude, this film sure is a masterpiece, raising the question (just like other excellent movies such as Full metal Jacket) of the psychological effects that war has on soldiers.",

1213,1 March 2015,elena-piens,7, A must-see a bit long,"Apocalypse Now was made in 1979 by Francis Ford Coppola. This film takes place during the Vietnam war. Captain Willard is sent by his superiors to Cambodia for a secret mission that « does not exist ». During this undercover operation, Willard has to find and assassinate Colonel Kurtz , a highly decorated Green Beret who has gone insane during the war. Kurtz is now in the jungle in Cambodia where a local tribe worships him and obeys to his orders. Willard and his crew go up the river which will lead them to Kurtz in a US patrol boat. Along the way, they encounter several interesting characters such as Captain Kilgore who is more concerned with surfing the waves than with the death of the soldiers and the outcome of the war. This movie shows how Willard confronts the horrors of human brutality, hypocrisy and the violence of war that drove Kurtz into insanity. During the whole film, Willard details his thoughts and discovers the darkness of his own heart. Usually I am not a fan of war films. However I really liked this one, mostly because it is not only about men on a battlefield, gunshots and blood but it also focuses on the psychological consequences that war has on soldiers. ",
1214,5 March 2015,aglaou,8, what an amazing movie !,"This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making 'the Godfather' and 'GodfatherII' and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like 'Apocalypse Now'. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz's compound. And just like Willard, he DIDN'T know what he was going to do once he got there. This is such a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it offers no answers or conclusions. Consequently, because of this open-endedness, it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious. ",
1215,13 March 2015,dopay,9, flawless,"Francis Coppola's masterpiece. Robert Duvall and Martin Sheen inspire people with their acting. The scene of the helicopter attack on the scene -this scene alone is a matter of writing- The use of Wagner's legendary Ride of the Valkyries was one of the things that impressed me the most. And of course there is the truth of Marlon Brando. The legendary player shows why he is legend, even though he is very rare in the film. The film did not humorously examine the war as in Full Metal Jacket. You can see the wickedness of the war more clearly. The only problem with the film is that the workout is too long. Sometimes people get sleepy. But none of this changes the fact that it is the best film about Vietnam. Follow my advice, watch it.",
1216,4 January 2017,ahmettaha027,9, Smells like... victory,"Others have said what a great movie this is! And it is! One of my All Time Favorites! I thought the Music of the DOORS, KING CRIMSON, and Wagner enhance the scenes and theme of the movie! I will admit I am a DOORS and KING CRIMSON fan along with the other music used in the film! The song ""The End"" emphasized the meaning of the movie! And ""Epitaph"" really said what was true at the time and in the movie ""The fate of all mankind I see Is in the hands of fools!"" These are some of the greatest songs at that time and still are today! All of the music in Apocalypse Now correlated(interacted) and enhanced the film! The music that was chosen was well thought out!",

1218,22 April 2020,ameelmothi,10, Great classic War movie,"Francis Ford Coppola's film ""Apocalypse Now"" was inspired by Heart of Darkness, a novel by Joseph Conrad about a European named Kurtz who penetrated to the farthest reaches of the Congo and established himself like a god. A boat sets out to find him, and on the journey the narrator gradually loses confidence in orderly civilization; he is oppressed by the great weight of the jungle all around him, a pitiless Darwinian testing ground in which each living thing tries every day not to be eaten.

1219,3 January 2016,robert-53033,9," Francis Ford Coppola's film ""Apocalypse Now"" was inspired by Heart of Darkness","Yes i agree movie is about darkness and horror of the war but I also think that it also represents USA and the way they leave things behind. By that I mean strict control of what they call ""freedom"", leaving disaster in every war for the selfish reason. Character of Colonel Kurtz is the one who points out absurdity of war and other strict social norms.
By the way: don't hate USA just an opinion of the movie 🍿",
