0,6 June 2000,FlickJunkie-2,10, A National Treasure,"James Stewart and Frank Capra.  One needn't know much more going in to be assured that this will be an enjoyable film.  Together they take on the Washington elite with this dramatic comedy about a naïve Washington outsider who gets appointed to the Senate and stands alone against corruption and graft.  Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is appointed from an unnamed state after one of its Senators dies.  He is appointed because the political fat cats need someone who will not seem like a crony, but who will not stand in the way of a graft scheme for a pork barrel dam that will make bigwig Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) millions.  When the wide eyed Smith gets to Washington, he discovers the corrupt bill because the dam will stand in the way of his own proposed bill for a children's camp.  When he tries to stop the project, Taylor's political machine frames him to make it seem like he is the one taking graft.  This leads to the dramatic confrontation in the Senate, where Smith filibusters in an attempt to get the truth out.",/
1,27 September 2020,Xstal,9, A 40ft Dive into a Tub of Water...,"Accomplished, honest and heartfelt, this will reinspire you to believe in the goodness of people even though the messages conveyed by those in power these days suggest anything but. James Stewart plays the innocence and naivety required for the role to perfection while you can genuinely believe that Jean Arthur has actually fallen for him for real. The great Claude Reins fills the boots of the corrupt senator with aplomb while Edward Arnold reminds us of a few of his type that are still around today. Probably the best film you'll ever see with the most mundane of titles.",r
2,30 June 2019,gbill-74877,8, Shining a light on corruption,"Frank Capra was an idealist for sure, but he certainly was clear-eyed in seeing some of the darkest problems with humanity and its institutions. At the beginning of this film, he shows us politicians who are firmly in the pocket of special interests, the degree to which is startling. A state governor (Guy Kibbee) is in charge of picking a new senator after one of the two serving for his state has passed away, but it's immediately clear that he operates as a puppet for a big businessman (Edward Arnold), a guy whose clout got the governor his position, and now who expects to call the shots as payback. We see it as one of the fundamental problems of representative government in 1939, just as it is today, so the film is highly, highly relevant.",e

The people pulling the strings in his party and State figure that he will be compliant and malleable and basically stay out of the way of their plans, some of which aren't entirely ethical, or legal. However, a well-intentioned deed sets off a dramatic chain of events, a series of events that will see him at odds with his colleagues, with the shadowy, bullying powerbrokers and with the entire Senate.",i
5,20 May 2006,Quinoa1984,10, drifts in and out of comedy and sincerity with the greatest of ease,"It was a lot of fun watching Mr. Smith Goes to Washington in a class where the professor noted how this was the sort of film that was of historical importance while not taking itself too seriously. And I think that's the way Frank Capra wanted it, in a sense. Perhaps in the time of 1939 America this film was seen as being of merit to the American Government's due (though according to the trivia, it was denounced at showing corruption and even banned for showing how democracy ""works""). But the director is also wanting to make an entertaining movie, of the kind of Hollywood appeal that brings 8-to-80 years olds in attendance. What had me interested throughout, particularly in that climactic, rousing twenty-minute sequence in the Senate with Jimmy Stewart's constant, un-faltering filibuster, is how it really is a patriotic kind of bravura to be shown on the screen. Here is how it SHOULD be done, to an extreme perhaps, in getting things done in government. But at the same time, Capra keeps it entirely watchable with that group of kids up on the balcony, keeping the audience laughing and smiling all the way through the great lines that Stewart says. ""Great principles don't get lost once they come to light. They're right here; you just have to see them again!"" This is a kind of talent that I'm sure few other filmmakers at the time, or even after, could have pulled off.",e
6,1 May 2006,stuartpiles,10," It works in a way no other movie could, THERE IS PROOF","Now, I must admit that this is one of my top five favorite films. There is a warmth, idealism, and kinda simple feeling of hope, that makes one believe that things will work out in the end. Capra knew exactly what he wanted, and it shines. Jimmy Stewart, in the role of his life, makes us believe, what we know is almost impossible in todays crass world.",w
7,7 April 2017,mark.waltz,10," The best film of 1939, about a love of honor that's gone with the wind.","For a film 88 years old and 14 presidents later, this film represents what is best about the United States and also a reminder what is wrong with it. I do find it difficult to pick out the best film out of the dozens of classics released in 1939, but of those 50 or 60, ""Mr. Smith"" remains the most prestigious with a message that resonates today. Like the dozens of classics in 1939, this has dozens of moments that are considered among the great scenes in film history. ",/

10,16 May 2003,perfectbond,9, A true classic that lives up to it's reputation,"Mr. Smith is as good as it's legend. Sometimes I'm disappointed when a universally acclaimed movie isn't as enjoyable as I thought it would be. But here, that is not the case. James Stewart is deservedly remembered most for this role. That's saying a lot given his impressive body of work. This is also Frank Capra's signature film along with Mr. Deeds. The idealism of Jefferson Smith might feel a bit anachronisitc today but, and I know this is a cliché, the world could use more people with his values. The supporting cast is also spot on. Jean Arthur plays the same type as she did in Mr. Deeds and Claude Rains is terrific as the mentor who betrays Smith. Strongly recommended, 9/10.",0

13,23 November 2018,cricketbat,8, Still packs an emotional punch almost 80 years later,"It's interesting how Mr. Smith Goes to Washington feels so dated and yet so relevant at the same time. This movie itself feels like Jefferson Smith, naively striding into the homes of the cynical and skeptical modern public, only to prove that it does, indeed have something important to offer. This movie still packs an emotional punch almost 80 years after it was made and it's easy to see why it's a classic.",0
14,2 June 1999,lenndogg,10, Required viewing for anyone elected or appointed for public office.,"Since the beginning of the art form, movies have generally fallen into two categories: the realistic, and the fantastic (fantasy-based).  There are some that point out that the films of Frank Capra unduly fall into the latter, that they are completely far-fetched and fastened in their own time, and even invented a pejorative term ""Capra-esque"" to describe any non-cynical, heartwarming picture that has a message.  His great films, like It Happened One Night, It's a Wonderful Life, and of course, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, however, are not fixed in a single era, but all eras, the truest definition of a classic.  And considering it was released among true powerhouses in 1939, a year as important to movies as 1998 was to baseball, its ideals, story, and general excellence shine as bright today as it did over 60 years ago.",1

Realizing him having no prior political experience and his naivety, Hopper thought that Smith would be easy to manipulate. Once in Washington, Smith discovers the downsides of the political process as his first piece of legislation he introduced, producing a national boys' camp, leads to a conflict with state political boss Jim Taylor.

21,25 October 2020,wilvram,9, Mr Smith's 300th review,"Superbly cast, acted, and directed with a gripping narrative and political observations that continue to resonate to this day, despite a tendency to slip into bathos, in particular at the conclusion. For me the most salient figure was Claude Rains' Senator Joseph Paine, representing a permanent fixture in all manner of political organisations of whatever stripe throughout the ages, the individual who starts as an idealist, but whom is corrupted by power, the system and above all by the immense continual pressure to do whatever is expedient. Such people inevitably do far more to further disenchantment with political causes than do the out and out crooks, if only because they are far more numerous. The story's major weakness in my view is that such an experienced type would use far more subtle tactics to take down and discredit an opponent. The ownership and control of the popular press to stampede the public and smear an individual is another time-honoured occurrence.",f

25,28 July 2010,sddavis63,8, Naive And Cynical At The Same Time,"You have to appreciate a movie that manages to be both hopelessly naive and bitingly cynical at the same time, and that still manages to make everything work. The great strength of this movie is James Stewart in the role of the newly appointed (much to his surprise) Senator Jefferson Smith, sent to Washington by his unnamed state's governor to fill a vacancy created by the death of the incumbent. Of course, Smith wasn't really appointed by the Governor. The Governor (and Smith's senior Senator) were just tools of the state political machine - a role Smith is expected to fulfil. But he's ill suited to the job. Jefferson was the leader of the Boy Rangers, who's spent his adulthood instilling into the boys pride in America and democracy and who isn't about to give in when he stumbles across corruption being planned by the machine, which then sets out to destroy him as quickly as it made him.",t
26,19 January 2018,zianimustafa,9," Classic scream at the top of the voice, not to corruption. Smith goes to Washington","""Mr. Smith goes to Washington"" is one of the oldest classics to have survived today, although it was produced in 1939, but still able to sweep the minds of viewers with his brilliant story, his brilliant output, and his extraordinary representation by silver screen star James Stewart ""He said. When the director Frank Kapra is mentioned, the first thing to come to mind is the successful participation of Stuart and Capra in It's a wonderful life. Indeed, these two films can be associated with each other to stay in the memory of all lovers of classical art. .
The story is about Jefferson Smith, a good-hearted, honest-hearted man in his life, who is nominated to serve as a senator in the US Senate to replace the former senator who died. When nominated by power men in America, they expected him to be docile. Be more than a grab in the face of their corrupt exploitative schemes. But Mr. Smith discovers corruption everywhere, putting every man in the Senate under the control of a few of the greedy, big-assed, greedy, despotic men who are unsatisfied with the looting of the country and the exploitation of all the people's resources and projects to serve their own despicable personal interests. So Mr. Smith has to face a whole system of fossilized minds and men to prove that he is right before being overthrown in a dirty way worthy of the malevolence of men who have taken over everything in the country. The story of the film despite its power, but it is very simple and not complicated We are used to it in films described as political and all you do is to waste the viewer in swirls that you might not understand anything about. In this film, the situation is quite the opposite. The issue may not concern many, but it is capable of gaining respect for the viewer from the beginning of the film and drawing it into an extraordinary story, the hero of which can be considered a man of the general public. The excellent script that combines power and simplicity can not be forgotten. It respects the professional cinematic scenes, while simplifying things for those who want fun only. The film's output is really wonderful and may surpass all the films produced in the 1930s. From the existence of a few minor errors in the editing and editing where some of the clips where the pieces are not correct for the viewer, but this does not reduce the technical value of the film, especially we are witnessing in this work crystallize the real classic cinema. James Stewart's performance was at the top, and he gave a performance that could not be described in a few words.
He was able to give us an accurate picture of Mr. Smith's simple, intelligent and intelligent personality, at the same time humble, generous and soft-tempered, and not happy to see a mistake without correcting it. The importance of the big film comes from the power of the ideas he poses in his own way, as he cries out against the corruption that has spread everywhere to extend to all the men of power, and even the press and media who have become obedient For the orders of a few people they spread their influence over everything, and did not like the voice of truth to leak out of the Senate chamber.
But if we think more, the thing that makes the film much more powerful is that its message transcends Washington and the whole of America, or any particular country because the message of the work is universal and can be seen everywhere. In any country in the world, exploitation can be seen by a small group, and the masses are silenced and blinded to remain like the herds that do not know anything, and all this is managed from the seats of power, newspapers and the media and everything that would prevent the collapse of any corrupt system exploits everything he can to fill ""At the end of the film Mr. Smith stood up after delivering a three-day speech in the Senate exposing the practices of every corrupt man in power and reminding officials of their duties to the citizens and the country. Then came the piles of messages from the citizens, approached Mr. ""Smith"" from these piles, opened a letter, discovered fraud, and saw with his eyes the killing of freedom and repression of the honorable, looked around him and saw corrupt officials are laughing around him .. No one with him .. Even the friend of his father Betrayed them .. look at them a recent look, and then fell to the ground .. A scene actually translated summarize the real happenings in front of us every day, but we manage her necks, and look away and go as if nothing was .. The right always in a war with corruption and injustice, and perhaps tired He demanded the truth and wished without finding anyone to help him. But in the end, the truth must prevail as it did at the end of the film. The end scene hopes that every honest person will see it with his eyes because injustice can not always continue, and it must collapse before the power of truth that is not covered by the lies of the corrupt and their blind hypocrisy.
Wonderful work worth the full mark without hesitation:",_
27,18 January 2005,ACitizenCalledKane,9," Idealism vs. ""the machine""","The theme of one man being able to combat the ways of a long-established system is not a new one. In fact, man versus machine is one of the oldest forms of conflict in cinema, but this is a different kind of ""machine,"" this ""Taylor Machine."" When a young, naive, and idealistic man by the name of Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is placed, as a pawn, in the United States Senate, he is honored and humbled by the job set out before him. He sees it as an opportunity to provide a service for his country, and, even more so, his people. In Jefferson Smith, we see everything that is good and wholesome in America. One man who wishes for nothing more than an improvement upon a country that he already cherishes. He intends to do everything he can to fulfill his duty as a newly appointed Senator. However, the people that put him there were not nearly as patriotic in their intentions. Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) and Senator Joseph Harrison Paine (Claude Rains) have conspired to put Smith in office in hopes that he will simply sit there and keep quiet while they pass a bill that will profit Taylor. Smith's dream of building a national boy's camp is shattered by Taylor's scheme to build a dam in the same area. The powerful Jim Taylor is forced to pull some strings in order to discredit the young senator so that his dam can be built. The Taylor Machine frames Smith, accusing him of fraud. Shamed, Smith is ready to leave Washington behind when his assistant, Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur) inspires him to fight for his ideals just as his forefathers had. Smith returns to congress, armed with a new strategy to accomplish his goal.",u

He is befriended by veteran Senator Joseph Paine(played by Claude Rains) who has been gradually corrupted and cowed by the rotten political bosses.

A man named Jefferson Smith (Jimmy Stewart) is appointed a senator for Missouri after the old one dies. Jefferson is now alongside Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains) also from Missouri. Jefferson arrives in Washington, DC completely vacant minded about politics and meets his cynical secretary Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur). Because Jefferson knows almost nothing about politics he was pretty much the perfect man to put in that position as Paine, Governor Hubert Hopper (Guy Kibbee) and a man named Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) are three corrupt politicians planning to build a dam, somewhere in Missouri. Luckily Jefferson has plans to build a boy scout camp at the exact same place and the two plans collide. Jefferson inexperienced but more determined then Paine, Hopper, and Taylor to get his ideas across, and along the way actually get's Clarissa on his side too. After a long filibuster in which Jefferson get's absolutely pounded but nevertheless continues talking all kinds of lies from Taylor's political machine come in. When Jefferson eventually faints. Paine can't bring it upon himself anymore and brings the entire blame on himself. It's a great and inspiring movie. The acting is great, especially from Stewart, and the story is amazing.

I would very much recommend this film at any time for a watch, it's extremely touching and an eye opener.

When a Senator passes away corruption threatens to step in until Jeffrey Smith is brought to the scene. Smith is seen as an honest man in awe of the Washington he has only dreamed about. He desires to do good by passing a bill to open a Boys Rangers camp but corrupt oppositions plan to build a dam there and counter Smith by smearing his name via fraud and damaging his reputation. Director Frank Capra is at his best in one of his greatest achievements. James Stewart plays off the wonderment and determination of Smith right up to the point where he stands practically alone against the Senate to defend himself against false accusations in a rousing climax. Jean Arthur plays his cynical secretary devoid of trusting the system until Smith sparks new hope that has her backing him up. Claude Rains plays Senator Paine who was friends with Smith's father but is now instructed to publicly destroy him. Rains reveals guilt and is pulled between integrity and corruption. Edward Arnold plays antagonist Jim Taylor who is determined to crush Smith. Thomas Mitchell plays Arthur's smitten aid. Theme showcases one man standing for truth and honor until hitting exhaustion.

In this film, he played Jefferson Smith, a revered boys' leader, in an unknown state. He gets appointed by the Governor to replace a deceased senator for the remaining of his term. When Smith gets to Washington D.C., he sees the sights and memorials like Lincoln Memorial and Capitol Hill with such awe and reverence. It isn't until he wants to get something done that he is met with those who preferred the status quo way of doing things. Smith isn't bought by anybody like the others and he won't sell out as well. The cast is first rate. Jean Arthur is brilliant in this Capra classic. The supporting cast included the Hollywood greats like Claude Rains, Edward Arnold, Beulah Bondi, Ruth Donnelly, and others. You will root for Jimmy Stewart's Smith because you want too. His performance brings you to him.",

48,30 March 2006,Hitchcoc,9, Pretty Tame Compared to What's Happening Now,"This movie is timely, even in 2006. It's probably the first really powerful film to take on the deal making and graft that went on in upper echelon politics. We are so naive as a nation when it comes to this kind of stuff. As I write this review, a new law concerning the accepting of gifts just hit the books. But it didn't include add on amendments to feather the nests of political districts. Of course not. You can do without the two martini lunch, but not the bridge to nowhere. This movie is about what happens to a man when he has high ideals. First of all, it's doubtful he would even be elected today. He would have to have millions and tell a whole string of lies to get there. Once there, he would have to see which backs to pat and butts to you-know-what. Still, Stewart does play a man of honor, one who thinks there is hope, and he gets his shirt tails caught in the machinery. The bad guys know that they may lose this battle, but it goes on to this day. All the cards are already stacked. Stewart's performance is masterful. He brings passion and commitment to the role. I like to think that he is something like the guy he plays. Frank Capra did a lot of work for the government and must have seen the ugly side. Some say his work is too simplistic. If the rest of America is collapsing around us, we should look to some of the optimism of the Capra films. Even if they stretch realism, they should make us think of the way things should be. I'm sure that were he alive today, some humorless knucklehead would be tapping his phone lines and screaming subversive.",

He's honest"".","It's easy to be cynical about Jimmy Stewart's character in ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"", especially from the perspective of 2010 and the fiercely partisan divide in the country. As Senator, Mr. Smith aspires to do nothing to disgrace the office. My gut tells me that a Smith in Washington today would have to be made of concrete and steel to remain true to his principles and avoid buckling under to the pressure of lobbyists, interest groups and fellow politicians. It's interesting to view this picture when the U.S. itself seems to be at the tipping point, with a majority of hard working, tax paying citizens virtually held in contempt by a ruling elite composed of both political parties. Maybe what the country needs right now is a Mr. Smith who can simply boil things down to what's right and wrong, someone with common sense who believes in honesty and integrity instead of one who can gain the most advantage through slick wheeling and dealing. It's easy to dismiss this picture as an idealistic aberration, a film who's values and vision couldn't possibly stand up to even the slightest scrutiny today. But you know, maybe that's the picture's strength. Maybe, just maybe, the mood of the country today can summon forth the spirit of a Mr. Smith, even if a real life character like that seems an impossibility. Naive, maybe. But we're talking about America here, and if America can't overcome it's own troubles, we might never get to see another Mr. Smith in Washington ever again, even in the movies.",
56,3 February 2014,rose_lily,10, Boy Ranger gets toilet-trained and it's a messy process,"James Stewart plays Jefferson Smith, a toddler in a man's body taken out of his small town rural play-pen and plunked down into the heavy political traffic of Washington DC. The sudden death of the incumbent Senator of an unnamed state prompts the state's political machine to appointment Smith as interim Senator. Smith's a local celebrity in his hometown, a proponent of boy's healthful living, the founder of Boy Rangers whose mission it is to prepare the male youth of today to take their place as the patriotic cheerleaders for the American Way in the world of tomorrow. The senior Senator Joseph Paine admirably played by that fine actor Claude Rains, and his puppet master, corrupt political boss, Jim Taylor, in the person of actor Edward Arnold, are convinced the newbie Smith is naïve enough and malleable enough not to disrupt their dirty program of graft and shady dealings so that business can be carried on as usual. Arnold, virtually typecast by Hollywood as the venal, power hungry businessman really puts this character across with all its hallmark, villainous trappings. ",
57,14 November 2007,dataconflossmoor,10," Mr Smith, Meet Mr Graft!!","Another Frank Capra masterpiece surfaces to the pinnacle of movie making!! ""Mr Smith Goes to Washington"" is a film which introduces the American public to the pejorative intricacies of the political process!! Jimmy Stewart's performance in this movie is considered one of the best acting performances ever in the history of the American silver screen!! Back in 1939, even with the Great Depression, Americans conceptualized politicians as icons of altruism who epitomized moral and socially ideological beliefs that people in this country could adhere to!! By attrition, more and more Americans have accepted the fact that politicians are the masters of one precarious preoccupation..it is called graft!! The complacency of pork barreling was something that the political spectrum wanted to keep covert... Here is where the very wet behind the ears Mr Smith (Jimmy Stewart) becomes astounded by the ulterior motives of the actual Washington DC, and not the one which he revered all his young adult life!! The film ""Mr Smith Goes to Washington"" makes filibustering a form of heroics, and translates the desires of the American people to the dogged tenacity of Jimmy Stewart to overcome graft!! Such a resilient assertion of democracy garnered an auspicious reaction from the American moviegoer!! ""Mr Smith Goes To Washington"" has become a legend in the movie world!! Such a charisma is largely due in part to the acting, and the directing in this movie!! At the same time, this film's strongest feature is the overall premise that graft can be overcome by a freshman senator, this powerful element to this movie ultimately cultivated a camaraderie with the American people!! If you have never seen this film before, I strongly recommend that you do!! When the phenomena of the White House and stars and stripes forever become relegated to a citadel of disillusionment, it takes the vigor of a magnanimous maverick politician like Mr Smith (Jimmy Stewart) to set things right!! Jimmy Stewart has always been the Mr squeaky clean baseball, apple pie, and mom type anyway!! He is perfectly cast for this movie!! Frank Capra, who has a virtual myriad of accolades in the world of Hollywood, does a tremendous job at directing this movie!! All in all, I think that ""Mr Smith Goes to Washington"" is a definite American movie legend!!",

59,13 November 2014,FedRev,9," Scathing satire of American ""democracy""","An all-time classic, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a scathing indictment of the American political establishment. It's about Jefferson Smith who is an all-American ""Boy Scout"" who fully believes in the Constitution and all the myths of American democracy. He's chosen to replace a U.S. Senator who has died, and because of his spotless reputation in the community and inexperience in politics, the Governor, controlled by capitalist interests, chooses to name him Senator thinking they could easily manipulate him. Once he arrives in the Senate, he quickly discovers that his idealistic (and naive) belief in the American system to reflect the will of the people does match up with reality. He's smeared by the corporate media (the Washington Press Club denounced the film as un-American after the world premiere) and his efforts to pass a bill to establish a local camp are sabotaged by the corporate political machine because it interferes with plans to build a dam on the same land. Seeing Smith as a liability, the corporate state goes into full character assassination mode, while Smith embarks on a filibuster in the Senate with the goal of exposing the corruption of the system. The brilliance of the film is that it shows how capitalist interests own and control the political system (a system that is set up as a distraction from that fact), and yet it doesn't allow Smith to be completely triumphant, which would have reinforced his idealism and proved the system can ""work"" if only good people are elected. The ending is left ambiguous and somewhat bleak as Smith proves his point but nothing is fundamentally changed. Jimmy Stewart gives a fantastic performance as Smith in this classic by Frank Capra.",

In that sense, the hero is entirely at home in the movie, though an outsider in Washington; we feel that through Jefferson Smith, we are experiencing the real America.  Stewart is wonderful from starry-eyed beginning to exhausted, verge-of-a-breakdown end; he is a hero we can whole-heartedly cheer for.  Claude Rains is superb as the fallen ""silver knight"" Joe Paine; it is clear throughout that we are looking at the ruins of a great man, and we share his humiliation when we see him in the degrading company of the triumphant press tycoon.

In many ways, the film is similar to 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town', and it is not really better; instead of improving as it approaches the end, 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is weakest towards the end. It seems to have a nice, feel-good air to it, so a ""happy"" conclusion is easily predicted, and if that is not enough, the conclusion itself is contrived. The final twenty minutes in fact are rather messy, and even if well paced to begin with, this over-sentimental tale does not stretch too well over more than two hours. There is a lot that makes this film worth watching though, even with its detractors. As well as the already mentioned visuals, Claude Rains and Harry Carey are excellent in their supporting roles, and the film does provide some insight into the workings of the United States senate and related politics.",

Basically U.S. Senator Sam Foley, of an unnamed western state, has died, governor Hubert ""Happy"" Hopper (Guy Kibbee) has to find a replacement, his corrupt political boss, media magnate Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold), wants a man appointed who will appeal to the people, and will be easy to manipulate. It is after a suggestion from his children that Hopper appoints the head of the Boy Rangers, naive and idealistic Jefferson Smith (Oscar nominated James Stewart), he displays a positive demeanour and does everything possible to gain a good reputation, but the newspapers portray and brand him as a bumpkin. Senator Joseph Paine (Oscar nominated Claude Rains) has a public esteem, but is secretly a crook, he wants Smith to propose a bill, with the help of his secretary Clarissa Saunders (Shane's Jean Arthur), who worked for his predecessor, Smith suggests a bill to authorise a federal government loan to buy land for the national boys' camp, to be paid back by youngsters across America, donations pour in immediately. It is when Smith goes to Washington he realises all the manipulation he has been drawn into, the situation gets worse when he realises he has been tricked into a political scandal, and he must appear before the Senate chamber. Smith exhausts himself to probe his innocence, proving himself actually knowledgeable about many subjects others thought he was naive towards, talking non-stop for about 24 hours, reaffirming the American ideals of freedom and disclosing the true motives of the dam scheme, until in the end he collapses, and Paine loudly confesses the scheme intentions, proving Smith's innocence.

Stewart won his actor for The Philadelphia Story, he lost out in this film to Robert Donat in Goodbye, Mr. Chips, I agree he could have perhaps won this film, he is an endearing character, the only problem I have is that the politics is a little hard to keep up with, but the plotting by politicians using the leading character as their puppet is interesting, the best scenes are him defending himself in a courtroom style chamber, there were the small amusing moments as well, I can sort of agree with critics giving this film five stars out of five, it is a worthwhile political comedy drama. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Story, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Writing, Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Sound, Best Film Editing and Best Music for Dimitri Tiomkin.

MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON oozes with patriotism and idealism, with corruption around the borders.  Jimmy Stewart does not ""belong"" in Washington, but the incredulous ""Jefferson Smith"" will not accept the limits put on freedom, hence Stewart's greatest performance. This is Capra's most idealistic work, a film he seemed to prepare for the upcoming test the United States would be put to in just two years in World War II.  Modern day viewers will no doubt see the dated elements in Capra's presentation of our country's mores.  I felt awe and a new sense of patriotism in the montage of images from D.C. that I wish I could still completely believe in.  Time has told us we can't.  ""Jeff Smith"" would be crushed in today's political climate, but it is a beautiful thing to see this David and Goliath fight take place in the form of a Senatorial filibuster.",

I've always hated the kind of sentimentality Capra espouses but I cannot deny that he is a great director. There is such sincerity in everything he does that even these themes that reek of over zealous sentimentality can actually feel compelling to an audience that just isn't susceptible to them. For one thing he always casted his films extremely well. 'Mr Smith Goes to Washington' is driven by it's excellent performances that turn these characters with motivations that seem so one dimensional into powerful representations of the optimistic world Capra so believed in. This is compelling despite all it's cartoon eccentricities. The fact is this is the most interesting Capra film. It shows a world that is dark and where Jefferson Smith is the only real idealist in it. It is an achievement equally shared by Capra and his brilliant cast headlined by Jimmy Stewart.,

The movie is about Jefferson Smith, played by one of my favorite actors James Stewart. After the senator of his state passes away, Smith is rushed into office to hold the US Senate seat. Smith is naive but has a very big heart with equally big ambition. He pushes for a national boys camps with the best intentions, but when his selfless prospects get in the way of plans for a dam, two other senators, Jim Taylor and Joseph Paine, conspire to get Smith kicked out of office through scandal and corruption.

Although the story line is great, some small details i the movie are too unrealistic to ignore. Obviously the actors over-dramatized most of the film to go along with the Capra-esque style(most notably the governor's children at the dinner table), but the main problem is during Smith's filibuster. Why were the boy rangers working in a sweat shop to make Smith's newspaper? How did so many rallies and parades get started in less than 23 hours? How did Jim Taylor get away with sending men to hurt little boys and take their newspapers? Why did everyone just stand there and watch as a man slapped a kid in the face and walked out with their newspapers? Why were little kids driving a car in the first place? How come there was no one watching the parade that got fire hosed? How did Taylor get away with sending people to shoot the parade with a fire hose?

There is much to enjoy in this classic story of a small town honest guy standing up against mighty political corruption in the big city. I didn't really see where this was going in terms of how the powers that be were going to destroy the James Stewart character – and then it hit like a sledgehammer! Really great stuff and just as pertinent today as it was 75 years ago when this film was made. it's a long film by the standards of 1939 Hollywood – but certainly does not outstay it's welcome. Beautiful quality black and white photography with some nice tourist scenic shots of Washington DC.

However, what this film doesn't tell you is that after he's re-elected 3 or 4 more terms, he becomes just as cynical and power hungry as every other ""career"" politician. I'm sure every person elected had the same ambition and naivete at first. Many cite this film as their inspiration to enter politics.

113,16 March 2022,Philipp_Flersheim,8, Jean Arthur's film,"Last night I spent an enjoyable two hours watching 'Mr Smith Goes to Washington'. This is a well-made film that offers suspense, romance and excitement and leads to a satisfying conclusion. Mr Smith (James Stewart) is politically naive and lacking experience but is appointed senator so as not to get in the way of a gang of corrupt politicians whose palms are being greased by a media tycoon. When Smith does notice something fishy going on they try to frame him as corrupt and to get him expelled from the Senate. He fights back, of course. Most actors are doing well, and Jean Arthur (as Clarissa Saunders, Smith's right hand woman) is brilliant. She is funny and touching in equal measure, and her transformation from hard-boiled Washington insider to sympathetic helpmate is absolutely convincing. I also liked Claude Rains as Stewart's co-senator and Edward Arnold as media tycoon and manipulator of public opinion (by the way: the relevance of this film for our age of social media and 'alternative facts' connot be overstated). By contrast, I found Stewart annoying. For my taste, his 'I am such a naive and normal guy'-attitude felt terribly overacted. He improves over time and becomes much better towards the end of the film, but still, there are other pictures where I liked him better. Another thing that is satisfying but could have been better is the ending: One of the corrupt senators confesses his misdeeds in a fit of truthfulness. 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' does of course want to convince the audience of the idea that there is good in every person, even in a corrupt senator, but the cynic within me finds this ending sentimental. The cynic within me would, for example, have preferred Saunders and her media-friends discovering evidence for the corruption in the senate. But that's a minor issue. Great film, all in all!",

But unlike most of the likable Hollywood stars, Jimmy Stewart is also an amazing actor.

Frank Capra is the quintessential American director. He was obsessed with optimism and an unequaled faith in the American spirit, and it really shows in this film. I personally don't care if the story is a bit far-fetched or if the characters are a bit exaggerated. This is not so much a film about Washington politics as it is about the power of right ideas. I feel he adroitly accomplishes his goal, which is to show that good can prevail. James Stewart is one of America's greatest actors. He was as hard-working and talented as anyone else. The role of Jefferson Smith could have easily been a caricature. A typical actor could have overplayed his bunglingness. Stewart, however, gives him a humanity and a naive sincerity that makes you really sympathize with him. This is one great performance. All of the supporting roles are very good. Claude Rains is perfect as the corrupted senior senator. He gives his character a interior goodness. I never really believed that he was totally evil. Jean Athur is witty and cynical as Saunders. She is one of the many innocents caught in the machinery of Washington. This is a really good movie. As a history teacher, I would like all my students to see this movie. This is more than fantasy.

This tale of the idealistic American everyman struggling and triumphing against the greed and corruption that has tarnished the institutions of our country is done in a way that only Capra could pull off.  This is perhaps his greatest achievement, with competition only from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  The acting is superb, with Jimmy Stewart giving an absolutely mesmerising (and frequently hilarious!) performance, and Jean Arthur making the role of the cynical secretary Saunders truly memorable, and reminding us that she's one of the most under-appreciated actresses of all time.  The two of them have great chemistry together, and the balance between comedy and drama is perfect.  For me, what makes this film truly remarkable is that it is profoundly patriotic without resulting to the flag waving, ""no questions asked"" attitude taken by many people today.  The movie expresses a real love for the country, but is not afraid of showing the flaws in the government, though admittedly the resolution IS unrealistic, but that just adds to its charm as a political fantasy.

140,13 November 2005,BobMrSmith,10, Do the right thing,"My all-time favorite movie because it is, above all, a film about simply doing the right thing. It is not even about Mr. Smith doing the right thing, however, because we know all along that he will. He couldn't be any other way. The real hero of the movie (you may disagree with me here) is Payne. Payne is like us. We are often conflicted about knowing what the right thing is; in denial and rationalizing actions we know are wrong; and weak about doing the right thing when we do know what it is. Jeff Smith only needs Saunders to remind him of what is right, and he will do it. But all is still lost without Payne. For sixty years the biggest criticism of this film has been its abrupt ending. It is often called a contrived ending. But I believe it is the perfect ending. Like Payne, each one of us has to step up, find our humanity, find our conscience and only then can the hero save the day, with our support! The film is brilliantly written with memorable characters and scenes. It is a perfect romance as well, since the attraction between Smith and Saunders is founded completely in their mutual respect and admiration. Without any kissing at all, the romance is there in their eyes and in the concern they display for each other.",

This was literally the first time I have seen it just moments ago and as the first half hour or so passed, I felt a sinking in my stomach. It wasn't grasping me, it wasn't blowing me away like Gone With The Wind did for the first time. Parts of it felt very dated, especially much of the dialogue between the supporting cast members. They all spoke (especially the children in the film) like 1940's gangsters. I know it was almost 1940 but they aren't supposed to be gangsters. Maybe it was a slang style of speech but it was overwhelming and little cheesy. They used the term ""seee"" more than a dozen times I swear. Then Mr. Smith begins to understand the corruption going on, then comes the epic cinematically historical filibuster and I was riveted to my chair while Jimmy Stewart pounds home his message in one of the most powerful scenes in movie history. The first half of the film dragged and didn't draw me in, but the latter half was the meat and potatoes and made this nearly everything I expected it to be. The first half of the film really delves into what is happening but I felt like it perhaps went into too much detail establishing the various characters than was necessary.",
142,7 October 1999,allyjack,8, The film's appeal has not diminished much,"(WARNING   -CONTAINS SPOILER) The freshness and appeal of the dialogue and characterizations and the	portrayal of overwhelming institutional machinations that threaten to leave American ideals in the dust has not diminished that much. Of course , much of it seems quaint now  - strangely located somewhere between realism and folksiness: The movie convincingly establishes the silly/Quixotic nature of Stewart's attempt to draft a Senate bill in one night - so when he actually achieves in doing so, it's hard not to see it as an abandonment of seriousness, a surrender to dreaminess. Stewart only wins his cause, after all, through a rather abrupt, bizarre crack-up by Rains - something of a deus ex machina that leaves the corrupt jungle largely unscathed. Of course, it could hardly be otherwise, but the movie might have aged better had it acknowledged the limitations of its story. Maybe that's why the scene where the newsmen gang up on Stewart and mock him as an ineffectual seat-filler has a nastiness and bite exceeding anything else in the film - a rationality that the more contrived, idealistic  plot developments can't push away. The film certainly zips by though, and the evocation of Stewart's patriotic wide-eyed wonderment when he first comes to Washington is still stirring: maybe Capra couldn't grapple in much complexity with the actual status of such idealism in modern government, but then not many movies have managed it since then either.",

This is probably James Stewart's earliest classic and a big part of that status definitely comes from his fantastic and charming performance, probably one of his best but he isn't the only good actor here, Jean Arthur is also amazing and Claude Rains too. The story is good (even though I think that it does have some flaws) but I it's only after Paine accuses Smith that it really becomes phenomenal and the ending is just fantastic and

Now let me get this out of the way, I don't care about politics, I don't like politics and they bore me to tears, this movie sheds it in a whole different light. Jefferson Smith is an honest man not knowing how to handle his spot in the senate, but wants to do everything he can to help his country.

It's got that glowing word-of-mouth aura about it, kind of like another of Frank Capra and James Stewart's collaborations, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. You know the story even before you see the film: James Stewart plays small-town community hero and full-time Boy Ranger Jefferson Smith, the idealistic naive kind of guy who's an aw-shucks patriot and can quote chunks of Lincoln and Washington off the top of his head. When one of the sitting senators in his state passes away, the massive political machine controlling and choking the state, headed by the ruthless James Taylor (Edward Arnold), goes into action. It's already bought out the senior Senator, Joseph Harrison Paine (Claude Rains), and attempts to break Jeff's back when he does finally go to Washington and his idealistic hope of setting up a national boys' camp in his home-state runs smack against a dam-building graft scheme Mr. Taylor is currently hatching. With the help of sassy, worldly Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), Jeff sets out to prove not only that he is innocent, but that his faith in his ideals and principles will win him the world and the respect he deserves, all this through an absolutely cracking filibuster that takes up the last fifth or so of the film.

He gets himself into a lot more then he bargains for when refuses to go with the plans for a dam. This movie gives the audience an interesting look into the inner workings of the American senate.

There are a few interestingly framed shots through windows of the Capitol dome, some at least of which I assume to have been done by multiple-exposure photography or rear projection (also, the ceilings inside the senate chamber are assuredly matte paintings). The Capitol is seen with awe and reverence by James Stewart's Senator Jeff Smith, and there's his iconic filibuster within, standing beside his desk once occupied by Daniel Webster, one of the figures from America's past venerated in the picture.",

It is truly a classic among classics and should have taken Best Picture away from Gone with the Wind in 1939. The same could be said about Jimmy Stewart who did not take home Best Actor for his performance in this movie. However, he did take it home the following year for his role as a reporter in The Philadelphia Story.

James Stewart conveys the idealism and naivete and (all to rare) honest-to-God decency of newly appointed Senator Jefferson Smith to absolute perfection. I really believe that this is Jimmy Stewart's finest hour. It's damn near impossible not to be deeply touched by his performance. He puts across with real depth of feeling the character's complete conviction and belief in the fundamental moral elements that the United States was built on, and also his complete heartbreak when he realizes that all is not so clean and constitutional in his nations capital as he had perhaps always believed. The rest of the cast provides first rate support, the direction (Capra at his best) is impeccable, the script is smart, touching, witty.. you really couldn't ask for much more from a film.

It shows the true way how a democracy system should work here in the US. The political statements shown in this movie were attack when the film was released, as people thought of it as anti-American and pro-Communist for its portrayal of corruption in the American government. In my opinion this film shows the faults and positives of our political system. A film like this really can give the viewer of what the true democracy system feels like and shows it only takes the courage of one man to stand up against corruption. Mr. Smith is that man who is not a career politician, just a common man that bleeds red, white and blue. He has an idea that would benefit sociality as it will help kids stay out of trouble and become men. When he finds out about the graft scheme he stands tall and challenges the big political machine Taylor, with out fear like the other members of the hall. This shows the courage of a man standing by his self against the same members of his party. Mr. Smith stands his ground and keeps to his word to ensure that a ""government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth""",

While he is full of patriotism and ideals when he arrives, he soon discovers how the system really works, with deals brokered in the back rooms behind closed doors.

After the death of the senate, they strive to search for a new candidate, yet not an honest one.  Who's ever heard of an honest government official?  They're looking for a guy that is a puppet.  A puppet in the puppet master's showthey search for a coward that will do anything to be in and stay in the senate.  Ironically, they find quite possibly the only man with true morals, Jeff Smith (Jimmy Stewart). 	Without going into too much detail about the movie, it must be said that the cast was brilliantly chosen.  Jimmy Stewart is such a spectacular actor and can light even the darkest of a character.  The fact that he's portraying an honest, caring man does him even better.  Every line is sincere, full, and alive.  He has such talent and grace on the set.  He was born to be an actor, and this movie was lucky to have him.  Jean Arthur put on a magnificent show.  She was sheik but tough, distressed, but strong.  In addition to the acting, the plot was solidflawless and catching.  It got very slow and drawn out at times, but nonetheless, it was amazing.  Frank Capra didn't go wrong in making this film. 	All in all, this film is definitely a keeper and very recommended.  Having an overall score of 8.4/10 stars, this viewer doesn't disagree.  A solid 8 for an astonishing movie.",

200,1 August 1999,sumocat,10," Jesse Ventura is right, we need fewer professional politicians in politics.","Frank Capra has an uncanny ability to tug at our base human emotions and elicit direct responses. He can take a typical American male character like Jefferson Smith, and turn him into 'David' while making the corrupt political machine into the 'Goliath'. Though Jefferson Smith is not a duly elected representative of his unnamed state, he does indeed represent everything we all want to be believe in. Like honesty and the American spirit of adventure and patriotism. No one but Jimmy Stewart could have been cast for this role. He even reprised this naive, idealistic type character in the film ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" I rarely agree with The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, but they were right in nominating Stewart for ""Best Actor"" of 1939. He did not win, but that year was packed with outstanding performances and excellent films. He was awarded the ""Best Actor"" by the New York Film Critics Circle Awards. Jimmy Stewart's 'Filibuster' performance was by itself worthy of an Oscar. A fine film that never goes out of date.

Mr. Smith Goes to Washington stars James Stewart as a naive Junior Senator in a world of corruption and career politicians. Overwhelmed by his surroundings and his new job he leans on an old friend of his fathers and his own childhood hero Senior Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains) for advice and direction. Mr. Smith finds that this country's government is not what he thought it was and neither is Senator Paine. If not for the friendship with his secretary, Miss Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), Mr. Smith's stay in Washington would have been very disenchanting.

209,16 December 2004,CurtMan@LVCM.com,9," ""Honest"" Politician Saves the Day","""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" is chiefly about the right and duty of every American to stand tenaciously for their beliefs, for the truth, and for their defense. Jimmy Stewart plays a naive, yet gentle-hearted and popular icon named Jefferson Smith who realizes that the political office can be effective and reverent if it operates solely for the people, rather than ""grash"" or entrenched special interests. Selected by Virginia political bigshot Jim Taylor (who influences every affair in state, from the political landscape to the savage press, and in turn Gov. Hubert Hopper) to succeed a perished senator, Mr. Smith goes to Washington oblivious as to the sordid and ruthless operation of Congress, and merely remarks how he is stupefied by the glory of the Capitol Building, enthralled by a visit to the Lincoln Monument, greatly reveres his colleague, Senator Joseph Paine, and wants to perform only the best for the citizens of his state. An exceedingly nervous and modest fellow (perhaps not entirely apt for brutal Senate speech and debate), when he meets Senator Paine's gorgeous daughter, he fondles with his hat and occasionally drops it to the ground, which gives the viewer the distinct idea that if he hasn't the backbone to regularly converse with an attractive woman, then how can he possibly survive the trials and hardships of the United States Senate. His secretary, Clarissa Saunders, initially doesn't believe in his ""superficial modesty"", yet is later captivated by his poetic innocence and honesty and assists him in creating propositions and offering advice, while secretly falling head over heels for him. During his first day in Congress, Smith trembles relentlessly in presenting his case for the construction of a National Boy's Camp, and is scoffed and humiliated by 96 members of the Senate. It turns out that his noble aspirations may be in peril, when it is revealed that a dam will be constructed in the appropriated place of his idea. Thus ensues a heartwarming, hilarious, and incendiary confrontation between the innocuous, noble Mr. Smith and the rest of the corrupted U.S. Senate, including the notorious and sordid Jim Taylor, in a captivating look at how democracy and goodness prevails when honest, tenacious men stand their ground, stand up for their beliefs, and act impervious to any derision of their enterprise. It may be at times overly condescending, sentimental and somewhat politically pretentious and fantastic, but ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" contains a noble statement about democracy and teaches us that it is ""the lost causes that are worth fighting for"". In Jefferson Smith, we see a hero, standing courageously, against all odds, for the honor and good will of representation. A fine and noble film indeed that is definitely a political classic. ***1/2 out of ****",
210,13 March 2002,mwardf,5, Strong political satire with man manipulated by woman,"Capra's film is distinguished by a number of issues. Surprisingly strong for its time - a mainstream film offering a strong crticism of the potential for corruption and graft that is endemic in a system built on the lobby and in a society where only money and power are counted as important in the social class system. In addition it offers criticism of the introspective and bureaucratically dominated political system endemic in any so called democracy where the process and the power are clearly more important to the participants (representatives) than the outcome. Finally, of course, it, yet again, causes one to wonder why on earth men are in charge of anything given their hopelessness and their susceptibility to manipulation by the superior sex.",

But if one looks closely, you can see ideas of pessimism start creeping in the mind of Capra. Regardless, Capra created a film that resonates with all ages and generations. With the idea of the filibuster being in the news lately, the relevance of Capra's picture is still prevalent with Americans in today's day and age.

No matter the political ideas or patriotic ones all this film really has is a fish out of water quality that irritates more than it makes fun of the character of Smith. As a drama it isn't dramatic, as a comedy it isn't funny, as social commentary it has an adolescent point of view that isn't naïve, it is ignorant. I could not care about the character because he doesn't really do anything other than pose as something, because he doesn't have the content of his patriotism only the façade. The Jean Arthur character is the only one with any depth to her convictions and in the end, she must be a convert to the irrelevancies perpetrated by Smith. I am too old to re-watch films I have seen in the past, so I won't be seeing this one again.

This movie's especially relevant these days, as we debate the proper place (if any) of the filibuster in the U. S. Senate. Here, Jimmy Stewart, who director Capra used when someone of unimpeachable moral fiber and ethical integrity was needed, uses the time-honored (or -dishonored, depending on your own point of view) technique of the filibuster to hold up a ""deficiency bill"" (presumably, to address the near decade-long Great Depression) because of the grossly unethical pork-barrel spending embedded in it. The corrupt men around ""Mr. Smith"" frame him for graft to impugn his reputation, but it's Jimmy Stewart, for goodness sake, so that's ultimately doomed to fail. By this time, Jean Arthur's very cynical character has been worn down by the essential goodness of Stewart's, so she is hopelessly in love with, and fighting tooth and nail to defend, him. For the strong performances, including one by the great Claude Rains, as the senior Senator and one-time friend of Smith's father, who had long since been fully bought and paid for by the political machine being run by Edward Arnold's character.

The inocence of Mr. Smith just draws you to him. This movie makes you hate the most powerful people in the nation. It also helped to show the world what political machines were capable of. But, most of all, it is yet another, and maybe the best, movie about a small man standing up to a huge adversary. The ending is one of the best ever. It ranks up their with Citizen Cane, Vertigo, Wonderful Life, and Dr. Caligari. It is a pretty basic scene, but it is executed perfectly.

234,15 September 2009,hasosch,10, Intellectual cleanliness and intellectual filth,"Frank Capra's movie ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" is from 1939. At the same time, other non-American born film directors either made confused war-chaser movies like Zinnemann did, or they delivered filthy patriotic crap on the lowest possible level like the Hungarian Michael Kertesz did in his so highly-praised ""Yankee Doodle"" (1942). However, stop and think what Capra is showing us in the movie: It starts with a sight-seeing tour that leads into the National Capitol of Washington, directly at the basis of American history. But the rest of the movie is dedicated to present the US Senate as a bunch of liars, betrayers and crooks who are as far away from the initial American ideas and ideals as anyone just can get. Hope comes for this continent in the person of the bum-chuck Jefferson Smith whose name is, of course, not arbitrarily chosen. However, it takes even him until to the last minute, before one of the criminal leaders who had misused American freedom, welfare and thrust of the public, breaks together. I would say: This is a very brave little movie, it exudes exactly the same miraculous atmosphere of hope even in the most proceeded situations as ""It is a Wonderful World"", Capras unsurmountable masterpiece, does.

There's a good tension during the third act, you'll get anxious and at the same time excited to see what Mr Smith is going to do next. Amidst all the chaos there's a love story, we don't get to see the resolution of it but its there. James Stewart performance is stellar as well as Jean Arthur's.",

245,14 November 2022,ohlabtechguy,7, Stark change of social behavior....,"This 1939 movie had the lovable, emotive Jimmy Stewart playing a regular guy turned Senator who decides to make moral behavior a top priority. Unfortunately, the writer/director sabotaged the Smith's character development early on by having him go on a rampage, punching at least 3 reporters to the ground. Physical violence and assault between adults and even between an adult and a boy(It's a Wonderful Life: 1947) must have been seen as socially acceptable during this period. If so, the Trump era, where violence is either encouraged or condoned at political rallies, is merely a throw back to a previous era, not so long ago. Physical violence and attacks are a seen as a sign of strength, exactly as Frank Capra depicted in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. This movie certainly deserves an explanatory warning for younger generations.",

The black hats and white hats are way, WAY over the top. And the dewy sentimentality is so saccharine as to give one a sugar hangover. Stewart's performance has to rank as the worst of his career. I found it completely irrational that simply stating to the press that Sen. Smith ""owned"" the property in question would cause such a furor. Didn't they have real estate records in 1939??? While I LOVE ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and try to watch it at least once a year, I cannot understand why this dreadful effort is considered one of Capra's best. Don't waste your time or your money. There are far superior movie directed by Capra out there. And much, MUCH better work by Jimmy Stewart.",

If there were no fashion gestures and mimics of that time you could not say that the film is so old. The movie does not miss anything, even not the color. The script is so planned and detailed that every dialogue is important and makes perfect sense. Can you recall of any such film made in color? Camera is pretty much piece of art. The technique of shooting, shot and scene interactions are perfect. Plot is fast, engaging and coherent. Art scenes representing body language mixed with camera angles, light play and contrast are amazing. The one could say that Capra really learned from German expressionists.

252,9 November 2021,michaelheiser-25099,10, Loved the story,"In a nutshell, Stewart plays an everyday man and before he knows it, the senior Senator Joseph Paine (brilliantly portrayed by Claude Rains), a man Smith admired all his life and who took Smith under his wing like a true mentor would, suddenly turns 180 degrees and convinces the Senate body that Smith's expulsion would be of best interest. It so happens that Paine and party boss/newspaper tycoon Jim Taylor (neatly played by the sinister Edward Arnold) are involved in a crooked irrigation plot that just happens to be where Smith wishes to establish his camp. Smith is dumbfounded to learn that he has been framed and that all kinds of opposition, including newspaper stories, billboard posters, radio announcements, telegrams, etc. Are all in favor of his being expelled, and yet he did nothing wrong; everything was doctored up by Taylor and his assorted heavies. Smith is so disheartened that he intends to leave Washington, but it is this chain of events that brings out the better qualities of Smith's feisty secretary Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), who encourages him to stay and fight back. He does, and his nearly twenty-four-hour filibuster is filled with memorable quotes and light touches of humor. To me, Jefferson Smith is a true hero because he is an ordinary man faced with overwhelming loads of corrupt opposition, and yet he decides to stick to his guns and fight. He eventually loses his voice and faints, but he still wins the day as Paine rushes back into the Senate and all torrents and chaos emerge.",

In this offering, We see a very aggressive, well-informed press corps, in an unnamed state in the Union, hounding the governor to make a senatorial appointment without the influence of bad guy ""Taylor"". But later in the film, when the new Senator Smith (Taylor's nemesis) needs political support back home, this well-informed, aggressive press corps is no where to be found.",

This is bar-none one of the best movies that I've ever seen, and that's not even close to an exaggeration. I love how this movie accurately portrays American politics, and gives us somewhat of a hisotrical perspective of the above. I love the main character, and I love the voice of the girl that's his secretary, her name escapes me right now, it's just so clique(spelling?). It has the knight in shinning armor kind of thing going for it, in a sense that the main character, Mr. Smith, is like a pure essence, and everyone else is evil, and it gives you hope for him and through him for American politics. This is the kind of America that Jefferson wanted, one that is run by the people, not by the elites of the country. This is by far the best black and white movie that I have seen, and for anyone that doesn't want to see it because it is black and white should see it, because it is so good.. You should watch it all at once though, I saw it over a period of three days, and I still think it's great, but if you see it all at once, it is probably so better since you don't have to wait to see what happens.",
259,25 May 2004,clarinetgirl25,7, Overly patriotic?,"During the time of WWII in order to keep their actors, writors, and any other person envolved in the movie making process from being sent to war,Hollywoods finest agreed to produce movies to improve American morale. Mr. Smith goes to Washington is one of those movies. This movie has all of the red, white, and blue, and anything inbetween that could make all people proud of America. Jefferson Smith a leader in a small town is suddenly put in the position of state senator. He is very naive and this is the only reason he was given the job. Soon he is able to make his own project which with out his knowing goes againsn't the political machine of his state. Smith finds out that one man is running his state and corrupting its politions with money. He fights againsn't it with all of his might and with the constitution keeps the senate floor running for over 24 hours! This movie of Frank Capra's is certainly idealistic and perfect for America during the time of war. But today can seem almost cheesy, When Smith goes to Washington he a common tourist times 10. He insists on seeing almost every monument in one day and worries his fellow politions! Now this is a little over board, he should have more priorities than that. Although certainly very American this movie is a little over patriotic and not the best of Frank Capras work. The reunion of Capra and Stewart is wonderful in this movie, Stewart is wonderful playing his role as the naive senator.This choice for Stewart is superb he is a role model for all Americans and enhances the movies morale to the nth degree! Overall I would rate this movie a 7 out of 10.",

The film was made in 1939, so there are some areas where the times (and how far cinematic technology has come since then) are obvious. Camera shots cut away and back to get closer to their subject in the beginning scenes rather than panning in. But don't let this keep you from it. There are also some beautifully shot scenes and fantastic camera work. There is a particular moment when Jeff Smith (Stuart) first approaches the Lincoln Memorial. The camera is set up high above the scene and you look down through those grand columns as he approaches Mr. Lincoln. It is stunning. The acting is superb and James Stuart shows his comedic genius. Jean Arthur is beautiful and tough and unforgettable in her role. There are plenty of quotable lines throughout. Perhaps one of the greatest feats of this film, however, is it's timelessness. All of the themes are still relevant today and the characters are still believable in our time. I truly believe this is one film EVERY American should see.",

I was proud of Jefferson Smith when he took the Senate floor and gave a filibuster-it showed his determination to do what's right through it all! I think you will enjoy this movie. It almost made me cry sometimes at the unfairness of Senator Paine, Jim Taylor, and the Taylor machine. Some of the information is a little out of date-there are 100 senators now, not 96. I also like the president of the senate because he seems to be on Smith's side during the last part of the movie.",

269,27 April 2023,shinrisen,6, Decent but predictable.,"James Stewart was my main motivation to watch this film and he certainly does a good job portraying Jefferson Smith, a naive Boy Scout leader who gets an impromptu appointment to the US Senate. The American nationalism (patriotism? Is there a difference?) got fairly grating (due to my brittle European sensibilities) during the first act, but afterwards it got less on the nose and was there mostly to serve the plot, which is totally alright. Jefferson Smith is a very awkward protagonist throughout the entire film and I kept rolling my eyes at his dialogue quite often. I realize this is due to me looking at my 2023 eyes at a 1939 movie, but that knowledge can hardly alleviate Mr. Smith's awkwardness whenever he does his puppy eyed Boy Scout Founding Father I-wub-the-constitution thing, which is basically the entirety of his character. Again, James Stewart does a terrific job as I like James Stewart but I have a hard time with naive protagonists in general.",
270,21 October 2005,biscollin,10, Have not seen one like it!!,I can not recall a director that I have seen in my life that has the simple depth that Capra has. You will not get the true genius of Capra until you have seen a few of his other films. What makes this film so special is that it tells a story of a Washington D.C. in the early 40's that we still going on in our day. Capra has the correct formula for storytelling. Using simple real influences like a greater good vs. a greater evil. We watch how these two forces impact a common soul. These elements create great tension and good stories. I would recommend any of Capra's films to anyone who is not afraid to watch a movie that is still black and white.,
271,1 May 2010,frncsbrennan,10, Jeff Smith for President,"Yes, if only it were true. Those were the days when a filibuster was a filibuster...not like the wimpy ones of today. Where it is just written down on paper and the senators don't have to stay up all night and suffer. But Stewart was incredible in this. His ignorance and gullibility were offset by his strength of will and integrity. Great performance. Jean Authur was a delight as a tough, hard bitten insider who, after a bit of fighting with herself, melts and falls in love with the idealistic and naive Jeff Smith. Idealism and romance don't get any better than this. And this movie has nothing to do with civics-it is a fantasy. But if you enjoy a good-no great-old fashioned movie, this is the one to watch.",
272,12 October 2009,RenHawk,10, Great Principles Don't Get Lost,"Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur stars in Frank Capra's ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" (1939) as Jefferson Smith, a young, honest and very patriotic senator; and Clarissa Saunders, Mr. Smith's secretary who tries to teach the new senator how Washington works and assists him when it seems everyone has turned against him. Immediately after his arrival, the media attacks the former Boy Ranger's leader. Unfortunately for Mr. Smith, this isn't the last time lies will come against him. After proposing a bill for a summer camp for boys, a fellow senator Joseph Harrison Paine (Claude Rains) turns against Mr. Smith. His bill, it turns out, interferes with one for a dam to be built on the same plot of land the camp would be located. With the assistance of Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold), a corrupt man in charge of the media and politics in Mr. Smith's home state, false evidence is planted against him and the reality of Washington comes crashing down. Refusing to back down, Mr. Smith continues to fight the corruption, not just for his innocence, but for the future generations.",

But to come into, ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" to see James Stewart leading a heavy political commentary peaked my curiosity and surprisingly stirred some doubts. Would an innocent John Doe be able to carry a story of this magnitude through an individual's chest as had been done before with Frank's tales?

281,29 June 2022,shannonbixler,9, Classic Stewart film,Classic Stewart film - powerful and feel good political drama about honesty and integrity entering into a place of corruption. When a Senator passes away corruption threatens to step in until Jeffrey Smith is brought to the scene. Smith is seen as an honest man in awe of the Washington he has only dreamed about. He desires to do good by passing a bill to open a Boys Rangers camp but corrupt oppositions plan to build a dam there and counter Smith by smearing his name via fraud and damaging his reputation. Director Frank Capra is at his best in one of his greatest achievements. James Stewart plays off the wonderment and determination of Smith right up to the point where he stands practically alone against the Senate to defend himself against false accusations in a rousing climax. Jean Arthur plays his cynical secretary devoid of trusting the system until Smith sparks new hope that has her backing him up. Claude Rains plays Senator Paine who was friends with Smith's father but is now instructed to publicly destroy him. Rains reveals guilt and is pulled between integrity and corruption. Edward Arnold plays antagonist Jim Taylor who is determined to crush Smith. Thomas Mitchell plays Arthur's smitten aid.,
