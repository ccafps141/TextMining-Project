0,31 October 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, One of my favorite movies of all time!,"Seriously, I know that sounds stupid as this is an animated movie, but why can't we have a favorite movie that's animated? If you ask me this is Disney's best animated film of all time. Why do you ask? The animation is just beautiful, the story is powerful and moving, the characters are terrific, the villain is one of Disney's most monstrous and the songs are out of this world incredible! Not only is it my favorite animated movie, this is one of my favorite soundtracks, with the strong power of Elton John The Lion King is absolutely beautiful and a pleasure to watch still to this day. I have to say also that this story is just so beautiful, it's still one of the movies that will always bring a tear to my eye. When I was 17 years old, I begged my dad to take me to the re-release of The Lion King, him and I being the only adults besides the parents who took their children to see the movie, Simba's father dies and I started balling! My dad looks around and said ""Krissy, stop it!"" and I just said ""But it's so saaaaad! Simba's daddy!"", yes I'm a sap, I can't help it, this is a powerful movie.",/
1,1 January 2000,Quinoa1984,10, The Best Animated Film I Have Ever Seen,"The Lion King is a great film.  Along with a great story (inspired by William Shakespeare's Hamlet), terrific animation, and an all star cast of voices, there are the lessons that are learned from this film (despite being a little rough for the younger children).  Like responsibility and honor.",r
2,20 January 2000,claudonio,10, A Film For All Ages,"This is a film that can entertain anyone young or old, I usually don't care for animated movies but this film is the real deal, this is one of disney's best animated movies. The animation is top notch and flawless. This film also features superb work from the vocal cast James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg. This is a standout.",e

4,17 February 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10," This is my sister's favourite film, and one of mine!","This is a fantastic movie, and I am not lying! my 13 year old sister loves this movie, and I can't fault this either. It was one of the first movies I ever saw, so that accounts for how much I love it. The animation is superb, the backgrounds look so rich, and for once, there are no stiff movements. The highlights were the stampede and the fight between Scar and Simba. The music by Hans Zimmer is outstanding, a perfect mix of African chants and pure Hollywood. The songs are absolutely great, I had no idea that Elton John could write like that. The best song is ""Can you feel the Love Tonight?"" but the others go without fault, ""Circle of Life"" is so spirit rousing especially. Likewise with the voice overs. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is very likable as Young Simba, and Matthew Broderick, while not as good, is above average too. James Earl Jones lends his booming voice to the majestic King Mufassa, and Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg provide flawless comic relief. The vocal standout is Jeremy Irons as Scar, who frightened me when I was little. Scar is up there with the best Disney villains, like Jafar, Malificent and Frollo. The humour here is fantastic, and you cry here a bit here as well. I highly recommend the stage version in the West End, and the sequels are actually two of the better DTV sequels.10/10.

5,10 May 2005,gdswalia,10, The best Disney animated film ever...,"The best Disney animated film ever...This film had it all, it was funny, emotional, had family drama, and above all, great animation and songs! My personal favorite character is Rafiki, the Baboon! I still cant forget the line he says to Simbe, ""Past can hurt, but as I see it, you can either run from it, or learn from it!"" it is so true! i loved Zazu's weirdness, and shenzi's humor, above all, i loved Pumba's innocence and Timon's intelligence! In short, i found the film the best film ever... The voice cast is also great. Mathew did complete justice to Simba, and what can I say about Mufasa, He is the best King, and dad anyone can ever get! The movie is not meant for kids, its meant to teach every adult a lesson...to find our place in the great ""Circle Of Life"". I give this film a perfect 10.",e
6,22 April 2002,chadgeri,10," By far, the greatest Disney movie ever made...","This movie is, quite seriously, the Citizen Kane of Disney animation. Every animated movie from Disney ever since has been a failed attempt to recreate the masterpiece that this film is. This movie is an anomaly in a market usually dominated by formulaic kiddie-fare. Unlike most films from animation studios, this movie will enthrall you, whether you're 5 years old, or 50. An epic plot, intriguing characters, great music and hillarious moments make this film a family classic that will endure through the ages. 10/10",w
7,21 July 2019,kaydrelia,10," Masterpiece, the new one doesnt compare","Watched the new one, and I think I had a disgusted look on my face the entire time. The music, the visuals, the dialogue, the voice acting, etc. Rewatched this one and remembered why this was my favorite Disney movie growing up. From mufasa's death to the goofy hyenas, to the bond between rafiki, simba and mufasa. The music that everyone knows every word to, and scar's ability to deliver each line perfectly. This movie is magic, the new one seems to tech focused and forgot what made lion king so beloved to begin with, its unfortunate. Hoping the circle of life makes it way around and the end of remakes draws close (see what I did there lol). Until then, lion king from the 90s will stay on my shelf and my kids will watch with me. This new one will never end up in my cart and I wont confuse my kids by watching it either. Thank you 90s Disney for the magic!",/
8,9 August 2009,moviesleuth2,10," A dazzling, joyous piece of film-making","Of all the animation classics from the Walt Disney Company, there is perhaps none that is more celebrated than ""The Lion King."" Its acclaim is understandable: this is quite simply a glorious work of art.",r

10,28 November 2005,suicune_tudor,10, A living masterpiece,"This is truly one of the best Disney movies ever. I really enjoyed it when I first seen it, about when I was 6, and since then I watched it over and over again. I simply LOOOOVED the music. It's one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. And, speaking of soundtrack, I just can't tell in words how much I love the song ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"". Is one of my favorite songs ever. I truly believe that this motion picture could easily be nominated for The Best Picture, but The Best Song and the Best Original Score is really enough. I wonder if they will ever think to make a prequel of this movie in order to understand who is Mufasa, Scar, Sarabi and the other characters. In short, this movie will be remembered in the next 100 years. Truly.",4
11,16 November 2005,Lady_Targaryen,10, My favorite cartoon from Disney!,"The Lion King is a classic from Disney. I remember going to the movie theater/cinema and watching the film...I was exactly 8 years old. And until now, with 19 years old, the good sensation of watching this movie is the same as that time. My mother even bought me Simba's doll! =)",6
12,28 March 2006,Hitchcoc,9, Wonderful Music and Rhythms,"This is an outstanding work of animation. I realize that it has been criticized for political incorrectness. The fact of the matter is that it has strong female characters as well as male, and it's about a vision of monarchy. I have the greatest respect for female role models but I really don't see this as a worthy criticism. It's a great story of defeat and betrayal and renewal. It has delightful individual characters, dressed up to show their beings in a clever way. It has the most despicable villains with Scar and the Hyenas. It has the Henry II thing about duty. It doesn't glorify fooling around as one of my colleagues told me. The free life is OK but at some time you must follow your heart and redeem yourself. The music is outstanding; another triumph or the Disney team. There are three or four numbers that are so critical to a complete understanding of the events of the story. The sound effects person should have been rewarded because sound is so critical in this. From the stampede to the forbidden areas of the kingdom. I watched this about sixty times with my small children and never really tired of it. I would put this at the top of any list of animated adventures.",9
13,8 August 2019,Tweekums,10, A Disney classic,"In the African savannah King Mufasa, a lion, rules over the Pride Lands. He explains to his son, a young cub named Simba, that one day he will be the king... but before that he has a lot to learn. There are dangers, even for lions. The greatest danger comes from Simba's Uncle Scar; an embittered lion with a Machiavellian streak. Scar wants to rule but to do that he needs to rid himself of Mufasa and Simba... he has plans. One day Scar's plan works; Mufasa is dead and Simba leaves the Pride Lands believing he is to blame for his father's death. He grows up learning to take things easy with new friends Pumbaa and Timon, a warthog and meerkat. Scar now rules the pride with the help of the hyenas. When Simba learns of how bad things have got in the Pride Lands he will have to decide whether to continue the easy life or fight to make things better.",4
14,5 June 2014,thediggens,9, A Modern Classic,"The Lion King is by general consensus the greatest Disney film from their glorious renaissance period (1989-1999), and is undoubtedly worthy of such recognition.

Pure genius. A timeless story. I might be a little biased in my beliefs, seeing as the first movie I remember seeing in theatres is ""The Lion King"" and I still watch it on a regular basis and know all the words but I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who agree with what I have to say.

20,14 July 2019,masonsaul,10, One of Disney's best,The Lion King is one of Disney's all time best films with a great combination of humour and emotion. The animation is incredible and it's extremely well paced. The performances from all of it's excellent cast are great. Hans Zimmer's score is amazing.

26,20 April 2020,Jeremy_Urquhart,10, One of the best animated films of all time,"The Lion King was pretty much my favourite movie growing up. It was one of those movies I probably watched dozens of times between the age of 2 and 6, so much so I probably had the entire film committed to memory at some point. So I definitely had fond memories of it, and still felt a great deal of emotional attachment towards the film, but for a while I started thinking- is the movie actually any good? Or was it just overwhelming nostalgia telling me that the movie was better than it really is in cold, cynical, objective reality?",_

28,5 September 2002,MovieAddict2016,9, Has the Disney magic,"The Lion King was the best Disney film of 1994, and perhaps for a few years after. We all know Disney's been hashing up cheap tricks for kids-dumb sequels like Lady and the Tramp 2, Cinderella 2, all that stuff recently. But the Lion King was great, and the all star cast including: Rowan Atkinson, Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg, Jeremy Irons and James Earl Jones really help this film too! Great animation, story, and characters. The Lion King's a great film!",r

31,13 April 2010,Avwillfan89,10," Of all the Disney movies growing up, this one has always been my favorite","Yes, definitely my favorite hand drawn animated movie of all time. It was my favorite as a child and it still is now. This is an epic and cult tale based loosely on Shakespeare's Hamlet. Set in between Kenya or Tanzania, Africa at an unknown time, the king and queen of pride rock christen their son, Simba, as the new prince. His uncle, Scar (Jeremy Irons), however, longs for the throne, so he conjures up several plans with the hyenas to get rid of the king Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Simba. The first one doesn't work, but in the second he is half successful. Luring Simba in a stampede of wilder-beasts (The goose bump-giving score by Hans Zimmer as powerful as ever at this point) Scar gets Mufasa to save him but then, as the king climbs to the top of a rock, Scar claws him and releases him. Simba then finds his father's dead body on the ground, and while mourning him, his uncle arrives, and convinces him it was his own fault, sending him away, with the hyenas on his tail to finish him off. ",
32,18 July 2016,nicholls_les,4, I was a little disappointed,"OK I know I am probably alone here, but I was a little disappointed with this film. Maybe the hype surrounding it gave me greater expectations, who knows? I thought it was a good plot, (although an overused plot in movies)and some of the characters were really good. But I found parts of the movie boring and the music not up to Disney standards. Elton John got an Oscar I believe, but can't see why.",
33,27 September 1998,Norway1,10, The pinnacle of animated movies.,"The Lion King is absolutely Disney's greatest achievement to date and will long be hailed as such. The story is classic, but better yet are both the stunning animation and the inspirational score by Hans Zimmer. The songs are brilliantly written with music by Elton John (with help from Zimmer) and Lyrics by Andrew Lloyd Webber's long-time partner, Tim Rice. If you aren't among the millions that have purchased the video DO IT (if you can find it anywhere)!",
34,7 September 2019,ProjectAnomaly,10, The Lion King,"This is the ultimate ""amazing movie"" stereotype, but it was well earned.",
35,26 June 2015,sharky_55,9, Through despair and hope,"When marketing The Lion King for the first time way back in 1994, Disney made the brave decision to have its first cinematic trailer consisting entirely of the opening sequence of the film. It's a decision that highlighted the enormous strength and beauty of that opening scene where the animals of the Pridelands gather for the coronation of young Simba while the iconic Circle of Life accompanies his introduction. It's a gorgeous spectacle of animation and music which immediately grips the audience's attention and establishes the setting. The cell-shaded 2D animation of the wide range of animals combines easily with the matte painted backgrounds which add visual depth and beautiful scenery in likes of waterholes, mountain ranges, lush forests and waterfalls. The foreground and background blend seamlessly and the world of The Lion King is endlessly alive and breathing even with its limited selection of camera movements. It's at once more inviting than the relatively sterile 3D environments of some more modern Disney works (Big Hero 6 comes to mind). ",
36,23 August 2021,MK_Movie_Reviews,4, Just musical instrumentals made this movie beautiful.,"This is one of the famous Disney movies but to be honest, it didn't impress me. I think I've watched this movie just once and it's enough.",
37,7 April 2011,reddragonhero17,10, The Lion King roars on!,"I first heard of this wonderful Disney feature when I popped in the Aladdin tape, and I knew it was going to be my favorite. A year later, I saw it in a theatre as a double feature paired with Angels in the Outfield. It was so good I did not want to see it come to an end. I begged to see it again and I got my chance at a library and it was just as mesmerizing. I finally got it on video and to this day it never fails to impress. With gorgeous animation, memorable characters, unbelievable score, and a well thought out story with a great message for anyone of any age (""We are all connected in the the great circle of life"", said Mufasa), what's not to like? My favorite song is Hakuna Matata (of course!) but I have many of these songs stuck in my head from time to time. To top it all off, I recently saw the Broadway musical and you owe it to yourself to see it.",
38,19 August 2020,kosmasp,10, Classic stuff,"There's a reason this is considered a classic. And while that term has been used or rather missused over at least the last couple of years or decade(s), this is one of those times it really fits. The movie is an animated fairy tale, that is also a bit grim at times. Still this is the circle of life ... and has so many memorable songs. Listening to the audio commentary, you come to realize how many things were in the balance while making this. How many things that are being considered genius now, were last minute decisions or things that they were doubting themselves (or the studio did).",
39,16 December 2010,gigan-92,10, Childhood Gem,"Is there anyone who didn't love this film? Besides the one sentence/one-star reviews that always bring a film down these days? Probably one of Disney's greatest animated films ever, easily surpassing the many before it and many after it. The story is dynamic and much more involving than alas ""Cinderella"", ""Beauty and the Best"", and plenty of others that I not need say. Many Disney films seem to me oh so similar in premise and characters, this one stand s out as a truly unique and very different tale. And with the voice talents of Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Whoopi Goldberg, Rowan Atkinson, plus many, many others, the characters seemed much more human to me than the repeated after repeated princess in distress who is best friends with nature as well.how dull! And to think these are merely anthropomorphic animals, how ironic. In my humble opinion, this also Matthew Broderick's best performance ever.",

42,9 May 2009,disdressed12,10, brilliant Disney animated film,"this Disney film was probably the most ambitious undertaking by the studio up to that time.the amount of animated sequences are astounding and the detail equally so.so from a technical stand point it's brilliant.and the content of the movie is great as well.the story is wonderful.and unlike many earlier Disney animated movies movies,the villain in this movie is much less evil,and the movie is suitable for most ages.there are a few intense scenes though,and a scene dealing with ***possible minor spoiler***the loss(death)of a character.other than that,though,it should OK for anyone.there are also a fair amount of catchy songs that kids will like,and even the adults might like.for me,The Lion King is a 10/10",

44,7 November 2008,g-bodyl,10, An Instant Classic!,"The Lion King is the movie that will be honored fro the next thousand years. It's really that good! The movie starts with young Simba being shown to the rest of the world by this old monkey. As the movies goes on, King Mufasa is murdered by his own brother Scar. Scar also banishes Simba from the kingdom. In exile, Simba meets a warthog and a meercat. When Simba becomes an adult, he ventures back home to take on Scar and his hyena sidekicks. Even by today standards, this film has very good animation. Disney always does a good job with animation. The songs and score is excellent and praise-worthy. My favorite songs are ""Circle of Life"" and ""Hakuna Matata."" The voice acting is full of brand-name talent such as James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, and Whoopi Goldberg. I do think that this movie is too violent for a G rating. It should be rated PG. Overall, an excellent family classic! I rate this movie 10/10.",

And yet watching it for the first time, I'd be lion sorry, lying if I said I thought it was top drawer Disney.

It seems ridiculous to think that the studio that now routinely make billions of dollars a year with their Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm output, as well as their recent fondness for re-imagining their so-called 'Disney Animated Classics' series in live-action, could have ever been in danger of actually going under. Yet Mermaid made the millions, Beauty and the Beast (1991) won critical adoration, and Aladdin (1992) charmed, and the rest is history.",

With Disney on such a high expectations were, while this was increased by the superb vocal talent and wonderful animation, and for many those expectations were met. Though a lot are going to disagree with me, I have to come out and say that I think the film is kind of overrated. That doesn't mean I dislike it as a matter of fact I agree that it does have fantastic elements, but for the heaps of praise it gets I'm not sure if it holds up well enough.",

This movie is a must see for any kid and I'm sure a lot of adults enjoy this movie too. Basically its about a lion cub simba who is future king of the pride lands but his uncle scar wants to be king and so forms a plot to kill simba he doesn't succeed in killing simba but instead kills simbas father. Scar convinces simba that it is his fault his father died to simba feeling upset and guilty runs away. Some scenes are funny and some are sad. This is a movie I could watch over and over simply because its a great movie as I have already said a must see for anyone especially Disney fans. I give this movie an 8 out of 10",

54,24 July 2011,MovieGuy109,9, A truly beautiful Disney classic.,"The Lion King spoke to me as soon as I saw it. It spoke to me as nothing less than a majestic adventure. Beautifully done on every level; from the music by Elton John or the whole story. I normally do not care for musical numbers, but these were excellent enough to draw me in. James Earl Jones does excellent voice work as Simba's proud and powerful father. It is more dramatically staged than any previous animated film and still remains a powerful work of art to this very day. Even amongst films in general, this one still holds its own as a classic and I think it will remain very powerful for a long stretch of time.",

I don't think that any animation film before it managed to enter the hearts of both children and adults at once like this one. An ensemble cast with such a gripping tale, great music and superb animation, made this one of the all time greats. The characters are so well flushed out and each scene is so memorable. I cannot stress just how good this film is. Without a doubt the peak of Disney and to this day they have not made anything this original and so influential. The creators gave us such a good villain and great hero's that in my opinion shows that an animated film can be just as good or if not better than a real life film.",

However, armed with a story lifted from ""Hamlet"" and some of the all-time great Disney songs, ""The Lion King"" became the last great film to come out of Disney's hand-drawn animations, and the last in a golden era which included ""Aladdin"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"". The young generation who grew up with this film have a level of affection for it that very few films have achieved. Their parents have a similar fondness for it. Now, some years on, that young generation can appreciate it as a family film once more with their children, but can also appreciate the superior level of craft which is in this film.",

The animation was amazing, and captured the essences of the Savannah brilliantly. The story and plot was one which people of all ages, not just children, could follow and understand, an impressive achievement for an animated movie, one scene in particular wouldn't leave a dry eye in the house, no matter what age the viewer may be, such was its emotional power. The voice acting was some of the best I've seen, particularly James Earl Jones, Rowan Atkinson and Jeremy Irons, and of course Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella, who at times were flat out hilarious as Timon and Pumba. The music and songs didn't disrupt the scenes they were in, if anything they added to it, particularly the opening song The Circle Of Life which was the best opening to an animated movie I've seen so far. Some have criticized the portrayal of certain animals like the hyena's and the movie doesn't depict life on the plains accurately, well the correct response to that is, its only a story and it isn't meant to as its not a nature documentary. This is a timeless classic which will never age, the fact that it took twenty years for another animated movie to overtake it as the highest-grossing animated movie is a testament to just how brilliant this movie is. A classic which all the family will enjoy.",

The main one is that it brings me back to my childhood, and at that time I enjoyed the movie so much. I even had the VHS in English and Spanish version. Then the film came out on DVD and I also bought it. When it first came out on IMAX for any reason I couldn't go to see it again so now for the 3D release I definitely was not going to miss that opportunity. And all I can say is that this film will be forever inmortal. At the theater that I went there were people in the mid 20s like myself singing the songs, repeating the lines, it is just something that you don't see everyday. About the movie, everything has been said before: it is just so perfect, so balanced, it is a treat for the eyes for its amazing animation, it makes you laugh histerically with lovable characters like timon and pumba, it has a lot of emotional moments (spoilers) yes mufasas death is very sad but what really gets to me is when mufasa gets into the stampede to protect simba that is just heart breaking for me its not the death itself but the events that occur before his dead. Also at the very end when Simba takes his place as king is just magical, powerful it gives me chills when the bones are washed away by the rain while simba listens the voice of his father ""remember"" definitely this is pure gold a movie for old and young and a gem that will absolutely will pass the test of time.",
69,11 July 2019,caseyt-48511,10," The King, Has Returned","What can I say about this movie that already hasn't been said? But I'll try. Simply, I believe The Lion King is the greatest animated movie ever made. It has some tough competition believe me. There's Wall-e, Toy Story, Spirited Away, Fantasia etc. But as an overall film, The Lion King stand above the pride.
The animation, is just beautiful. It holds up so well over 25 years later. Even in an age where 3D animation is getting better and better, the classic hand drawn look of the film never ceases to amaze me. The movements of the characters and the lush backgrounds are beyond superb and the entire animation team should be commended.
The characters are so memorable and lovable. Simba, our reluctant hero, must overcome his past and insecurities to save his people. Matthew Broderick is great as Simba as well. Scar is one of cinemas best villains. A great example of how a villain can be so in the wrong but also understandable and even sympathetic. His motives make sense, but his methods are detestable. Jeramy Irons captures all of that wonderfully in his performance. Mufasa, played by the amazing James Earl Jones, shows us how a monarch should behave. He's respectable and never takes more than he needs. He teaches his son to respect the world and the creatures who inhabit it. The rest of the cast of characters keeps us entertained throughout. Timon and Pumba are brilliant comic relief and Rafiki reminds me a lot of Yoda. He's a wise old master who helps our hero discover his calling.
The music is so great. Several songs are performed by The amazing Elton John. Tim Rice wrote the lyrics. While the songs are rightfully praised, the musical score by Hans Zimmer is one of the best in movie history, bar none. This is Lawrence of Arabia and Star Wars levels of epic music. It has so many iconic themes and it rightfully won the Oscar for best score.
It has a deceitfully simple plot, but once you unfold it more, you see the extra layers to it. The story has been interpreted in numerous ways, but I've always seen it as an allegory against unchecked and abused power. Scar is a dictator, through and through. Mufasa was a benevolent king who only took what he needed and, despite the predator-pray relationship, respected the world around him. Scar on the other hand, cares nothing for the people but only his own gain and glory. Simba realizes that he must stop Scar to save his people and return peace to the land. He has great power, so he must have great responsibility. He can't rule over the people with an iron paw but with a gentle and compassionate one. It's a story that resonates with me. I always find something different about it every time I watch it. Of course, you can interpret it any many other ways I'm sure, this is just my take.
All in all, The Lion King is a masterpiece of animated cinema. It is the Disney company's greatest achievement and is rightfully celebrated as not just one of the best animated movies ever, but as one of the best movies ever made, period.",
70,18 February 2023,zombiemockingbird,5, Overrated,"I must have missed something because I just don't get the love for this movie. First, I have too many questions. This pride (much larger than a normal pride) has a huge amount of lionesses, but only two male lions. So who is Nala's Father? Either Mufasa or Scar, which makes her Simba's sister or cousin, and their romance a little disturbing, but I guess that doesn't matter in the lion world. Then after Scar is gone, I guess Simba is the only male? I know, I'm overly analytical, but details like this bother me. I find it hard to believe Mufasa didn't realize how much Scar hated him, and didn't take more precautions around him. All that aside, James Earl Jones is the perfect voice for Mufasa and Jeremy Irons is perfect as Scar. Rowen Atkinson as Zazu, Whoopi Goldberg as Shenzi, Cheech Marin as Banzai, Robert Guillaume as Rafiki, and the wonderful Nathan Lane as Timon all do a perfect job. Unfortunately I have a problem with Matthew Broderick as Simba. I love Matthew and he's a great actor, but to me his voice just wasn't the right choice for Simba. The music also leaves me cold; none of the songs are memorable and I really hate ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"". Sorry Sir Elton, but it's so syrupy and cheesy it makes me gag. This story has one of the most heart-wrenching death scenes of any Disney movie with Mufasa's death, and Scar's death, although not shown, has severe implied violence; all a little much for young kids.

79,18 July 2019,Ryan_Barbakins,9, The art form of Animation at its Finest!,"The Lion King is an artistic masterpiece. The combination of different colors and shapes portraying this Shakespearean story result in a cinematic experience you will not want to miss. All of the characters leave an impact on the audience through the beautiful character development and relationships. This makes the meat of the film engaging and heart-breaking.
Mufasa's death scene is sad, because we sympathize with Simba and his father's relationship that was previously established. Some consider it to be the saddest scene in cinema history, and I can't argue against that. When Nala finds Simba after many years of sorrow in the Pride Land, their love which was foreshadowed at the beginning feels deserved and romantic. Even as a kid I always found that scene compelling.
The main thing that makes this story and the characters work is the animation. Nobody would have cried over Mufasa's death if we couldn't see Simba's emotion portrayed in the animation. Every character is personified, because in animation you are able to do this. This is why I am not excited at all for the Live Action remake. You can't take away emotion from the movie and expect the audience to relate. Disney remaking their animated films in live action in general is not a good artistic idea. It is always a downgrade from the original, because you cannot portray emotion on inanimate objects or animals in the real world. That is why the animated versions are always better.
But in the end, even though the live action version will most likely be terrible, at least we still have the beauty of the original.",

It explores the themes of self-identity, grief and honour in a beautiful and emotionally-destructive way. The characters all do what they're supposed to do without being too annoying or bland. Scar is an intimidating and terrifying villain who really packs a punch. The songs are all outstanding, my personal favorites being ""Hakuna Matata"" and ""Be Prepared"".

It's an absolute classic that still holds up today as a beautifully animated and exhilarating film, I become warped in to this universe every time I watch it and almost immediately because of its beautiful opening image, we really care for these characters and support them on the journey they are headed on, it can be quite dark at times, very emotional, but it never forgets to add some great comic relief. I felt like the film could have taken more time to develop Scar's character, it needed to make its audience more aware of his motives, not just his plans on achieving them, I would have liked to have seen longer scenes between him and the hyenas, as this is when the villain is truly honest about who he really is, and he is certainly one of the greatest Disney villains there is. The characters and voice acting in this film are certainly the best part and save it from being a boring animation with talking animals, Simba, Timon, Pumba, Mufasa, Nala, Rafiki, Zazu and Scar are all characters that I remember fondly from my childhood, as I watched this film again and again, and still today love them just as much as ever, as I understand some of their lines, particularly from Timon, that I never did when I was younger. Beautifully animated, jam packed with great songs, memorable characters and emotional scenes, the Lion King is easily some of Disney's greatest work, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film.

I loved - and still love - the early work, and have mixed reactions to most of the stuff from ""Peter Pan"" through ""Oliver and Company"" with a few exceptions. ""The Little Mermaid"" seemed like a return to form - and a return to the fairy tales that the company always seemed to do best with, and I liked ""Beauty and the Beast"" even more. ""Aladdin"" was alas a major step down - still pretty solid in the animation department, but Robin Williams' shtick was for me completely out of place and irritating. It was of course their biggest hit to that point, and they took some of the lessons they'd learned - less romance, more slapstick and gross humor, celebrity voices - and applied them to ""The Lion King"" with even more spectacular results.",
88,15 July 2019,andrewmerritt-31652,9, The king of all animated films.,"The Lion King is an animated Disney film featuring voice of Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, and James Earl Jones. The film revolves around a future king who is tricked by his evil uncle to never return. This film is also inspired by the Shakespeare play Hamlet which both films have the same plot line, except The Lion King is more appropriate for children than Hamlet. And that's what makes this movie so perfect in every way is that the screenwriters decided to take a classic Shakespeare play and make their own version made for kids, while at the same time not following Hamlet down to detail. Before the new Lion King comes out I thought I watched the original where it all began. The animation that went into this film is beautiful as everyone involved really took the time to develop a film that has passion and soul to it. And the voice acting is top notch too from James Earl Jones as Mufasa to Jeremy Irons as Scar. In all of Disney movies there will never be a better voice actor as Jeremy Irons. Ever delivery is chilling and sends goosebumps thinking about it that if there was ever someone to narrate my life he would make that list. I don't know how the new Lion King will turn out, but I know that this Lion King trumps the new one, and all Disney films. And while this may be he king of all animated films, the soundtrack provided was average with one or two songs that are excellent to listen too. So before you watch the new one take a moment to go back where it all began and experience a movie so hypnotic and beautiful from start to finish.",

If there was one slight flaw, it's that how stupid was Scar to reveal his role in killing his brother just as nephew Simba was at death's door. But it did provide Simba to get over himself quickly so maybe that was necessary. Otherwise, The Lion King is one of the greatest experiences I've had at the movies. P.S.

And it's not just cause the prince is a lion. You feel the pain and hurt and betrayal along with Simba. You learn and grow along with Simba. You love along with Simba. As with most Disney animals their facial expressions say more than words could say and when Timon laughs about the Kings of the past being in the stars, Simba really needs to say nothing at all. It's all there written in his face and they way he carries himself as he leaves. It's almost a coming of age story. As a young cub he had the world at his paws. Then he sees it slip away with the death of his father and being driven out by the hyenas. Only to later on come back and see that Pride Rock is really home and fight for what is rightfully his. Pop some popcorn and sit back, relax and enjoy!",
107,13 January 2012,talarisw,10," Walt Disney's 32nd animated feature film about Simba, a future lion king who must fight his evil Uncle for the throne.","I wish Walt Disney was alive to see this, he would of loved it! This is probably the ultimate Disney movie. What makes the Disney movies so great are how they take themselves so seriously despite being a kids cartoon. I don't care how old you are but you're be lying if you said this movie didn't move you. This movie is similar to Disney's 2nd greatest film, Bambi. They both begin with the birth of an animal who is destined to be king of his domain, they both lose one of their parents, and the story ends with them both taking their place as king. The film's also a lot like Shakesphere's Hamlet, a story about a man who kills his own brother so he can be king. In fact, this is the first original Disney story and what a great story it is. In Disney's tradition the animation is fantastic and realistic looking. The African landscape looks awesome and very detailed. I love the idea of a lion king, because we are know lions are the king of the jungle. So take a lion king, Bambi, hamlet, and you got your self a good story. But every story needs good characters and in the tradition of classic Disney movies this has a lot of good characters. I love James Earl Jones as Moffassa, his voice is perfect for the role. He sounds authoritative and loving. Simba, the star of the story, is likable and sympathetic. You feel for him and root for him. You can't help but to love Timon & Pumba and they provide good comic relief. The hyenas are likable, even though their bad. But Shenzi, Bonzi and ED are not as evil as Scar, but are mostly indifferent, they only care about their own self interest. I wish they would've done a spin-off with the hyenas like they did with Timon & Pumba. Then there's Scar, who has to be the most evil villain in any Disney movie. I also think he is an underrated villain, I mean I never see his name on any ""greatest villain list"", he's one of the best villains ever! He killed his own brother, tried to kill his nephew, made his nephew think that he killed his father, and lied to everyone in pride rock! In fact, he might be too dark for little kids. The music is great, and I know sometime it's hard to sit through musicals, but the songs fit well into the story. And how can you not love the ""Akuta Motta"" song! That song's my philosophy too, I believe in ""No worries for the rest of your days!"" But the best song, hands down is ""circle of life"". Written by Elton John and sung by Carmen Twillie. If the movie dosen't move you, the song will. In fact, that's what makes this movie really epic, is the underlying theme about the circle of life and I like how the movie came full circle at the end of the story, ending how the film began! The lyrics are great! ""It's the circle of life, and it moves us all, through faith and hope, through despair and love, until we find our way on the path unwinding, in the circle of life!"" This film has the best opening of any movie, it's truly epic. The only problem I have with this movie, is how the story gets a little convoluted towards the end, but that's because they had a lot of story they were trying to wrap up. And I also think it's funny how were in Africa but Simba sounds American, Scar sounds English and Rafiki sounds Jamecain, or how that Buffalo stamp peed went on forever. The directors Roger Allers & Rob Minkoff did a fantastic job, on this timeless classic!",

109,16 January 2006,rebeljenn,2, I'm in the minority - I didn't like it,"'The Lion King' is a Disney animation about a lion cub named Simba who runs away from his responsibility after thinking that he is to blame for his father's fate. Along the way, Simba meets Timon and Pumba, the comical sidekicks. It's a sad film, but it is a film about life, and it is realistic in that sense. However, 'The Lion King' is probably my least favourite Disney animation. Although Timon and Pumba are supposed to provide the comic relief, I found the couple very annoying. Yes, this film had huge success in the 1990s, but I was never impressed with it. Most people seem to really enjoy this film, so I am probably in the majority for giving it a low rating, but I just did not think it was that good of a film.",

Surely this is even more traumatic than the death of Bambi's mother. And yet, I have to rank this as one of Disney's very best--the color, design, characterizations,and music are all superb. The use of earth tones, so different from Disney's usual bright palette, is stunning and perfect for the story. (And here I want to add that the soundtrack is also excellent--my only quibble being that the powerful ""Circle Of Life"" should have won for best song instead of the pretty but vapid ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"". But that being said, I believe that, like ""Beauty and the Beast,"" should have been nominated as picture of the year. If you haven't seen this, what are waiting for?--arnie113",

Not like in Bambi, where they just hint at the mother dying. Here you actually SEE the body. The characters are all likable, all the way down to the two best, Timon and Pumbaa. As a kid, I always found them incredibly funny. The villain is probably for me the best Disney has ever done as well. Scar really has that clever acting of Jeremy Irons and his interaction with James Earl Jones is extremely believable. And I real like the clever message it's sending through the scene with Rafiki and Simba. ""The past can hurt. But the way I see it you can either run from it or... learn from it.""

136,24 April 2016,tibercromwell,9, Absolutely Amazing!!!,"This has grossed $987.5 million worldwide. Considering it a better movie than the Wild. Anyways, let's talk about the movie. In the Pride Lands of Africa, a lion rules over the animals as king. The birth of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi's son Simba creates envy and resentment in Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, who knows his nephew now replaces him as heir to the throne. After Simba has grown into a young cub, Mufasa gives him a tour of the Pride Lands, teaching him the responsibilities of being a king and the Circle of Life. Later that day, Scar tricks Simba and his best friend Nala into exploring a forbidden elephant graveyard, despite the protests of Mufasa's hornbill majordomo Zazu. At the graveyard, three spotted hyenas named Shenzi, Banzai and Ed attack the cubs before Mufasa, alerted by Zazu, rescues them and forgives Simba for his actions. That night, the hyenas, who are allied with Scar, plot with him to kill Mufasa and Simba. The next day Scar lures Simba to a gorge and tells him to wait there while he gets Mufasa. On Scar's orders, the hyenas stampede a large herd of wildebeest into the gorge. Mufasa rescues Simba, but as Mufasa tries to climb up the gorge's walls, Scar throws him back into the stampede, where he is trampled to death. After Simba finds Mufasa's body, Scar convinces him he was responsible for his father's death and advises Simba to flee the kingdom. As Simba leaves, Scar orders Shenzi, Banzai and Ed to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. That night, Scar announces to the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing a pack of hyenas to live in the Pride Lands. After running far away, Simba collapses from exhaustion in a desert. Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and a warthog, find him and nurse him back to health. Simba subsequently grows up with them in the jungle, living a carefree life with his friends under the motto ""hakuna matata"" (""no worries"" in Swahili). When he is a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reconcile and fall in love. Nala urges Simba to return home, telling him the Pride Lands have become a wasteland with not enough food and water. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off, leaving Nala disappointed and angry. As Simba exits the jungle, he encounters Mufasa's mandrill friend and adviser, Rafiki. Rafiki tells Simba that Mufasa is ""alive"" and takes him to a pond. There Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the sky, who tells him he must take his rightful place as the king of the Pride Lands. Simba realizes he can no longer run from his past and goes home. Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa join him, and agree to help him fight. At the Pride Lands, Simba sees Scar hit Sarabi and confronts him, but Scar taunts Simba over his ""part"" in Mufasa's death. However, when Scar pushes Simba to the edge of Pride Rock, he reveals that he killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba roars back up and forces Scar to reveal the truth to the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs Simba for mercy, insisting that he is family and placing the blame on the hyenas. Simba no longer believes Scar, but spares his life on the grounds of forever leaving the Pride Lands. Scar appears to comply, but then attacks his nephew. After a fierce fight, Simba throws his uncle off Pride Rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and eaten alive by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. With Scar and the hyenas gone, Simba ascends to the top of Pride Rock and takes over the kingdom as the rain falls again. Sometime later, with Pride Rock restored to its former glory, Simba looks down happily at his kingdom with Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa by his side; Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the inhabitants of the Pride Lands, and the Circle of Life continues.",

But looking at it again there are somethings that don't work, such as why did Scar reign cause a drought? But anyway I still found many things that I still enjoyed. The comedy for me works very well, I laugh so hard whenever I see this movie. The songs, although all very catching, listening to them again I found some were annoying and were just alright. But I found that the orchestral score greatly outshines the singing ones. The voice actors, especially James Earl Jones, do a great job and I see them fit into their roles perfectly. The movie also gets some of its story from one of Shakespeare's greatest works, Hamlet. And finally, the animation is spectacular. Every bit looks grand and big. The style looks great.

The songs, too, are often out-of-place and serve to tell instead of show, or do a combination of the two, and they tend to point out the flaws in the narrative more than gloss over them, though most are enjoyable to listen to in-the-moment and all are well-produced. It really is the lack of a real connection, however, perpetuated by a poor through-line and pace, that makes this one fall short of the pedestal upon which it has been placed.

You could not make any more generic villain. Simba is so spoiled, he disobeys rules which have obvious consiquences, he do not have any responsibility all he cares about fun, until at the end of the film he takes the leadership. There are tons of songs in this film which makes it incredibly annoying and kills pacing. The story is very simple and weak. The only good thing about this film is humor.

Set in South Africa and regarding the respect and measuring authority. It opens with a celebration as lion cub Simba is born and he desires to be just like his brave father Mufasa but his deceitful and jealous uncle Scar seeks to prevent Simba as one day becoming King. Central plot regards an incident staged by Scar that results in Mufasa's death and Simba's leaving the pride in belief that it was his fault. Glorious African animated scenery with a variety assortment of wildlife appearances. Matthew Broderick voices adult Simba who will grow to different standards after being rescued by a warthog named Pumbaa and a meerkat named Timon. He will have to adapt to his destiny and challenge Scar for his rightful place as King. Scar is voiced by Jeremy Irons who forms an alliance with hyenas and successfully reduces the pride land to ruins until Simba dethrones him. Moira Kelly voices Simba's childhood friend lioness Nala whose adult form is a great introductory and her fate bares brilliant repeat to the opening. Pumbaa and Timon become the ultimate rags to riches duo. They are voiced effectively by Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella. This is Disney animation at its very best. Score: 10 / 10",

I personally don't believe Disney has yet created a more beautiful film, since it isn't just a detailed rendition of African wildlife, but its such a deliriously colorful and expressively animated film to boot. The story is honest in its portrayal of the corruption that exists in the world, but more importantly, in the hope that good moral judgement can overcome such corruption. The voice cast is pitch- perfect, the soundtrack remains the absolute greatest in animated film history, and the script (while perhaps not wholly original) deftly balances searing emotional truths with charmingly silly antics.",

There is a little bit of Hamlet in the plot. Previous films were routine love stories where boy and girl meet, know each other, fall in love and stay together in the very end. This film is much more than that. Simba is a young prince and his father is the King, who is respected and loved by all. The prince is next in line to the throne. He is innocent and naive and eagerly wants to grow up and take his place as King. Scar, king's evil extremely jealous brother, wants to be King himself, and he is ready to go to any means to get what he wants. Simba, along with his best friend Nala, is having a happy childhood - until one fateful day, where his father is cruelly killed by Scar, right in front of Simba's own eyes, hurting him for life. When Scar tricks Simba into believing that he killed his own beloved dad, Simba runs away, far away, never to return. He meets Timon and Pumbaa, who teach him some important lessons: Life is worth living. And Hakuna Matata - no worries. Simba grows from a small cub with a painful past, into a handsome and mature young lion. When Simba and Nala meet again after all these years, he falls in love with her and Simba's life takes a dramatic turn. It is a truly great combination of drama, comedy, romance, life lessons, and musical songs in a Disney movie.",

170,21 July 2019,Benslie,10, One of the greats,"First of all, the music in this film is just so iconic and no matter what generation you are a part of you have heard these songs more than once. It's not just the songs that I'm talking about the score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is spectacular. The score fits so well with every scene and it helps to intensify the scene. The entire movie is just filled with incredible music. The animation in this film is stunning and, in my opinion, looks better than some of the animated movies we have now a day. The animals have amazing detail on them and you can easily tell that the animators put a lot of effort into making each and every detail. Not just with the animals but the background as well. This is best shown in the ""I Just can't Wait to be King"" song where the animators took the time to change up the backgrounds to help convey that this is a dream sequence. I know it's weird to mention cinematography in an animated film but honestly, this film almost feels like a live-action film and I will do whatever I want because the cinematography is outstanding in this film. From shots where they are showing a bright scene and then quickly changing to dark is just amazing. The characters in this film feel three-dimensional and anybody can easily relate to one or more of the characters. From the people who are free and easy-going like Timon and Pumbaa to the protective parent like Mufasa they all are relatable and had great voice casting. Everybody was perfectly voice casted and I could easily see them as that character. I only really had a problem sometimes with Matthew Broderick where a couple of times I couldn't really hear it. This film has a great message in it that you shouldn't run away from your problems but deal with them right then and there in the present. In the end, this film is perfect for anybody and everybody.",

The story is set on the African savannah full of vitality. The magnificent savannah sets off the profound themes of love, responsibility, growth and life cycle into a grand epic, showing a new and magnificent world, and letting us experience the life of love and adventure. This connotation transcends any culture or country, because human beings cannot change the laws of nature, and love is the emotion that human beings always pursue.

181,1 December 2007,mk-ajjampur,10, Lovely lovely movie,"Writing about this film brings with it a feeling of nostalgia for times gone by. This was in fact the very FIRST movie that I watched on the big screen; way back in 1994. I can still recall the awe and the wonder I had when I sat in the rows (somewhere in the middle I think) and looked up at screen. Ah, the good old days...Anyway, to cut to the chase, the movie itself is a triumph and one of the best animated movies that I've seen. While the story itself is essentially about the eventual triumph of good over evil, this hackneyed theme does not stop the story from being poignant or touching. In fact, one might say that that it actually serves as the moral for a story that after all was aimed at children. The central character of the movie is Simba, the baby cub of Mufasa, the king of the lion pride. The movie begins with his birth and unfolds as we watch Simba mature from a young cub to a youthful lion (the transition occurring in the wilderness after his evil uncle Scar kills off his father). The movie concludes with Simba regaining his rightful place in the ""circle of life"" and becoming a father himself (after an epic fight with Scar. The battle was one of the best scenes of the movie. Extremely Powerful.) And as far as the animation goes, everything is top notch. The songs of the movie were hit songs with ""Hakuna Matata"" becoming a sort of an anthem for a while, I think. All in all, a great movie that should be watched, if only for its songs and some scenes.",

I watched it again today after not watching it since I was a child, maybe a little over ten years ago. I really cannot believe the big fuss and when I read reviews on here to see what everyone loved about it I couldn't really find anything and to be honest it just seemed that everyone was stating the obvious 'the songs,' which were the only terrific thing about the entire film, and the fact that they 'loved it as a child,' but children love what everyone else loves, can you really point out something that can really be admired? Do people not consider the incoherence of the plot? I have seen many reviewers see the film as I do, and they tend to point out the things that people don't seem to realise, such as the extremely annoying characters and the fact that the characters are almost... scrambled-like throughout. It's hardly a story. And I know you could say well maybe I liked it as a child because it is a child's film but as many people have stated it is not - because of the violence and depression. What irritated me most is how the film makes you feel sad at the death of Simba's father, yet Simba himself just runs away and almost immediately seems to feel indifferent towards the situation! He just DOESN'T care! He starts singing hakuna matata for goodness sake!!",

As for the sex, don't worry, your children will not learn about sex from cartoon, sex is in their instinct, as soon as they reach five, they will notice the difference, and will do some experiment with their body, and that is natural...so don't say how grossed you are because you noticed sex everywhere, because that is your perverted mind, kids are still too young to notice it everywhere... and I was mad when I read some bad comments that said how it is unbelievable that there is only one male lion , and all others are female, well it is not only BELIEVABLE, but it is TRUTH, there is only one male lion in pack of lions, no more, so you ,,smart'' people could learn something from this cartoon, It would be like watching National Geographic...

Now just hear me out, this movie is the reason that I have assembled my love for movies in the first place.

The movie is perfectly paced and plotted, and I was never bored even for a second. The characters are well written and Simba's struggle to overcome hs traumatic past is incredibly engaging. I love his bond with his dad, and Mufasa's death is probably the saddest scene in all of Animation. Scar is also an amazing antagoist, constantly manipulating Simba into thinking and doing what Scar wants him to. The side characters are fantastic as well. Nala, Rafiki and Timon and Pumba all have a lesson to teach Simba, and they all have very distinct personalities. The climax is well set up, and Scar's death is oddly poetic, as he never respected the Hyenas and get to feel their wrath.

One that you can use to justify your views on various topics. Only a hand full of movies delivered the aforementioned attribute as well as The Lion King. Although this film's plot is enough to prove its brilliance, factors like voice-acting, background themes, dialogs, etc give an attentive viewer more to be impressed with. Case in point: James Earl Jones's voice boosted Mufasa's powerful appearance. The voice had a commanding tone which rivaled Mufasa's powerful roar. Likewise, there are many details that can make this movie the face of Disney. It has been more than 10 years since its release, and it still boasts a strong stance against far more graphically advanced movies. Kids as well as adults can enjoy this flick, possibly without snacks. I rate this film a ten out of ten while suggesting that everyone watch it at least once.",

As a child, I loved the slapstick humour, and as an adult, I discovered the numerous funny wordplays. The musical songs are fantastic, ranging from spooky (Be Prepared) to romantic (Can You Feel the Love Tonight) to joyful (I Just Can't Wait to Be King). The voice acting is brilliantly on-point, with Rowan Atkinson as Zazu and Jeremy Irons as Scar being my favourites.

But, having just seen it recently, I feel as if I must write this review. While not considering myself a movie buff, I have seen plenty of movies on AFI's top 250. However, even after seeing some of the best movies of all time, none of them compare to this one. (Biased) This is the best movie of all time, and let me explain. It expresses emotions that no other movie does, and because it is an animated children's movie, it is innocent while doing so. And I don't think anyone can disagree to the fact that the voice acting is loaded with talent, or the fact that the opening song is the most memorable of all time. The animation is fantastic, and HAND DRAWN! No matter how good computer animated films are, they will never achieve the 2D masterpieces Disney had in the 1990s. And this one is the most masterful of all, without a doubt. In a time of movies mostly about immoral behavior, and when the ethics of America are crashing down, we must all go back to happy days of our youth, with the Lion King.",

(My 100th Review Ever)","The best Disney animated move ever made, ""The Lion King"", was recently re-released in theaters everywhere, in crystal clear, high definition 3-D. I was super excited because ""The Lion King"" is my all-time favorite Disney animated movie, and the thought of watching this spectacular movie in 3-D, it felt like I'm seeing it for the first time. Everything in the movie is still memorable to this day. The memorable characters we all know and love, including Simba, Timon, Pumbaa, Nala, Rafiki, Mufasa, Scar, and the Hyenas, are still the characters we know from our childhood. Also, Hans Zimmer's incredible music score is breathtaking and exhilarating, and it helped tell the story. Speaking of that, the story is an example of what happens when Shakespeare's Hamlet has lions! It's thrilling, funny, breathtaking, heartbreaking, and it has a message that's truly uplifting. But the best part of the whole movie, is the beautiful and memorable songs brought to us, by Elton John and Tim Rice. Everyday, almost everybody sings to ""Circle of Life"", ""Hakuna Matata"", ""Just Can't Wait to Be King"", and the forever-classic ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"". I hope that all audiences will enjoy a movie like ""The Lion King"", for the characters, the songs, and it's beautiful heart. It has been an amazing movie-going night to experience the greatest animated movies ever. Long live the lion king! No worries!

The story introduces Nala and Symba's relationship as ""just friends"" which we all know that in a Disney Movie it means they will get married by the end. When Mufasa died, the world cried. Next, the third male lion takes over Pride Rock (since no other males are there to challenge him.) Symba has been forced to live with two hooligans in the wild growing up eating bugs. That is not healthy for a growing lion. He needed real meat, which is probably why Symba was a lot smaller than his dad. When Symba finally comes back, him and the lionesses fight with an army of thousands of hyenas, somehow winning. But who cares! Scar is eaten alive for his betrayal of the hyenas and eventually the damage of years of drought and fire and famine are replaced in a very short amount of time. They all lived happily ever after. ",

229,27 November 2011,peter-224-474288,9, An emotional masterpiece for all ages,"Directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, The Lion King (1994) is a Disney masterpiece. It provides a colorful and multi-emotional experience while subtly delivering an important life message, enjoyable for people of all ages. Not many films are so enveloping as to successfully simultaneously deliver an action-packed adventure, romance, and comedy. Throughout the entire film, the audience is entranced by the wondrous diegesis that is created, and so easily mourns when it is supposed to mourn and laughs when it is supposed to laugh. The Lion King uses animals as opposed to humans (as in Shakespeare's Hamlet), but this contributes to the experience and message rather than takes away from them. Under all the emotion, this charming film makes a social statement, that the circle of life must inevitably continue, and death should be accepted as long it is part of the natural cycle. As a perfect mix of an emotional experience and a moral message, it's no wonder that The Lion King raked in so much revenue and is seen as one of the best films in Disney history.",

There will always be hard moments and evil people we have to deal with, but we can overcome it with some help from some good and true people in our lives. That moment in the end when Simba finally walks up the rock to rightfully claim his place as king and roars, always gets me; they manage to capture how tough the struggle is and even with the look of awe from his friends and family in that moment, I just love it and I love this film. I always think kid stories should teach people about good and evil and the Lion King does this brilliantly. In that way its a kids and adult story all in one, and as a young adult, I still think it's brilliant! I can't recall how many times I've watched the play in London and NYC, and have taken friends and family to see this too. This will always be a classic. I can't wait till this is back in the theatre (London and New York) - already planning to take some of my young family members to see it early next year when it should hopefully be safe.",

239,26 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,9, The Lion King is one of Disney's greatest animated musicals.,"If I was tasked to rank every Disney animation, this universally beloved feature would most definitely be in the upper echelon. It's quite rare these days to find someone who has not seen this...and if you haven't well, I'm disappointed in you. The story revolves around the 'Circle of Life', paraphrasing nature's way of taking and giving back life to earth. As current lion king Mufasa teaches his son Simba how to be a great king, his brother Scar secretly plans to obtain the throne of Pride Rock for himself. There's not much I can say that everybody else hasn't mentioned. Hans Zimmer composing yet another epic orchestral masterpiece. The first time that the music and animation blended together in perfect harmony. Elton John and Tim Rice's musical numbers are some of the best Disney has to offer. Literally every song is memorable, my personal favourite being ""Just Can't Wait To Be King"". The animation is absolutely beautiful and still holds well even by today's standards. The effortless blend of red sunsets and green grassy plains. The computer animation used during the wildebeest stampede might look slightly dated, but it doesn't detract from the enjoyment to be had here. Then we come to the voice acting...oh God damn it's perfect. James Earl Jones as Mufasa was inspired. Jeremy Irons as Scar was sensational. Heck, even Rowan Atkinson as Zazu worked! Every actor provided a voice that gave life to the animation. Not a single voice felt out of place. A nice light comedic script to balance the more powerful themes it conveys such as fatherhood, death and facing your past. The inclusion of Timon and Pumbaa was just the comedy the film required, and I'm sure children will adore these two. Whilst this is undoubtedly one of Disney's best, I do find the third act slightly unmemorable compared to the amazing first two acts. It just feels slightly rushed and concludes far too rapidly. Minor gripe aside, The Lion King is a film that is indefinitely adored by everyone.",

Sure, there are heroes in Disney that search for their destiny in life in other films, but The Lion King tells it in a unique light, with a much deeper meaning. The Lion King has many great point, from the music, down to the detail for characters, with some really good lessons for Your kids that will possibly help them later in their lives. One thing I really enjoyed about this film was the Characters, I enjoyed how real they were, it made me feel like I was in the movie. The realistic behavior of Simba and Nala as children was on point, it shows how kids are innocent and don't know any better, while also showing the view point of an adult, and the dynamic between Father and son. I also liked the strong scenes in the film, when Mufasa appeared in the clouds to speak to Simba I was taken back, because it actually made me feel something in my heart, it deeply touched me. Further more I loved how the characters had flaws, but their good characteristics balanced with the bad (all except for Scar). The movie goes through points of development, and many emotions. The animation, and attention to detail in this movie was wonderful, it was extremely well done, well thought out, and well planned.

256,27 November 2018,justin-fencsak,10," Nearly 25 years later, still the king of animated movies.","When Disney released ""The Lion King"" during the busy summer of 1994, during which Forrest Gump would become the best picture winner and millions of people watched the OJ bronco chase on TV during an NBA Finals game between the Knicks and Rockets and ordering pizza in droves, it became a cultural milestone not only at the box office, but in merchandising. The storyline on the movie blends in MacBeth with African culture in 84 minutes of pure excitement. The movie tells the story of Simba, a young cub lion raised by Mufasa and his wife Sarabi, who travels the plains and meets up with Nala and their companion bird Zazu, along with the predictable monkey Rafiki. During a stampede, Simba watches in horror as his dad falls into the running crowd after losing grip of Scar's paws, causing him to perish into lion heaven. On his own, Simba meets up with Timon and Pumbaa, and they grow up to be like adults. In the end, Simba fights Scar to the death and helps Nala give birth to Kion, who will become the next lion king in the made for video sequel The Lion King II: Simba's Pride. As for Timon and Pumbaa, they will return in an animated tv series and a prequel between lion king 1 and 2 called lion king 1 and a half. A tv series called the lion guard would soon follow, and a live action remake will bring new audiences who didn't grow up watching the original will get a chance to relive it all over again!!! As for the movie itself, it's timeless and memorable. I first saw this movie when it was in theatres and it stunned me. I would relive it over again when i saw it on vhs and again on DVD in a special edition that adds in a happy song, ""Morning Report"", as well as the IMAX soundtrack from the reissue in addition to the original 5.1 theatrical soundtrack. A 3D conversion would soon goose up the profits until Frozen broke the record for highest grossing cartoon in modern dollars.",

262,1 May 2007,briguy128,3, The Beginning of the End,"I am simply amazed at how much positive response this emotional hodgepodge has received since its release back in the summer of 1994. As a young teenager back then, I saw it opening weekend on the big screen and remember thinking that it was a very visually engrossing film. In terms of capturing realistic movements and sweeping scenery, the animation in THE LION KING had easily surpassed any of its animated predecessors, and for that I found the movie fantastic. As an adult now, I realize just how superficial my initial attitude toward the film was. If there's one thing that today's overabundance of CGI has taught me, it's that there's more to a film than just ""looking good"". You need story, compelling characters, an original and well-defined conflict, and, especially in the case of animation, an artistic hand with which to draw. There's no denying that many talented artists were at work on THE LION KING, unfortunately too much effort was put forth in animation achievements and too little in developing a solid story and a clever script. Like many other IMDb users, there's no denying that this film was adapted from Shakespeare's HAMLET, just as Disney's 1988 film OLIVER AND COMPANY was adapted from Dickens' OLIVER TWIST. I wonder why Disney did not acknowledge its blatant robbery of subject matter. This is unfortunately just a minor detail in my dislike for THE LION KING. This was, in my opinion, the first in a series of many films that signaled the deterioration of Disney's traditional hand drawn animation department. No doubt about it, they were in a definite slump in the 1980's: THE FOX AND THE HOUND, THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE, THE BLACK CAULDRON (ugh!), but with a fresh new crew in their animation department and a galvanizing reinvention of the formula for animated musicals in THE LITTLE MERMAID, it seemed that Disney had gotten back on its feet. Alas, THE LITTLE MERMAID, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and ALADDIN were merely Disney's Indian summer, for with THE LION KING came a completely new generation of animated films. With THE LION KING and its followers, viewers were bombarded with a predictable stories, numerous pop culture references, an obnoxious slew of celebrity voices, dated 90's pop songs, campy humor, and heaping spoonfuls of sugary melodrama. Don't get me wrong, many of Disney's previous efforts had many of the same deficits and only a handful of them would I consider near-perfect, but the animated flicks of old never attempted to sell out their audiences in the way that THE LION KING did. Yet somehow all of these flaws are what made THE LION KING the most successful animated film in Disney history. Call me old school, but I do not think that Walt would have approved of this. Since THE LION KING's release and the replacement of traditional animation with CGI, animation I feel has lost its art. I dare you to re-watch LADY AND THE TRAMP, BAMBI, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, or anything made pre-1960 and compare it to such 90's fares as THE LION KING. You will notice that the films today no longer resemble moving paintings as they once did and as was the original intention of animation. Still, my opinion of THE LION KING, as well as the rubbish that followed (POCAHONTAS THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, HERCULES...okay, MULAN was not bad up until its pop-music ending..THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE???!!!) seems to be the minority. None of these later Disney flicks were works of art, they were just another form of advertisement---predictable story with the feel-good moral of an ending, comic relief sidekicks, a pop song rolling during the end credits, etc. Yes, they all have very admirable morals (what makes a true hero???...it is important to embrace diversity...who's the real monster here???)but (gasp!!!) that's unnecessary political propaganda. Disney wasn't always that wholesome (Does anyone remember the Siamese Cat song from LADY AND THE TRAMP or ""What made the Red Man Red"" from PETER PAN?) and, even when they did take America's sensitivity into consideration, it never overwhelmed the entire project. Oh well, censorship is a completely different subject that needs not be addressed in this review. The point that I'm trying to make is that somewhere along the road animation was no longer considered art but simply cheap entertainment guaranteed to make money. And when I hear praise for films like THE LION KING for merely manipulating the general population with special effects, melodramatic plot twists, pop songs, and cheesy one-liners (not to mention lame attempts at comedy via ninja-fighting), I think back to when an animated film was not just a movie, but an idea, a seed, a creative project, an event, and and art form, and I am saddened.",

266,24 July 2019,jboothmillard,9, The Lion King,"This Disney animated favourite was a big box office hit, it spawned a successful worldwide stage musical, and got a photorealistic remake twenty-five years later, the original remains a crowd-pleasing cartoon. Basically, in the Pride Lands of Africa, at Pride Rock, the lions rule over the animal kingdom. There Simba, the new-born son of King Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Queen Sarabi (Madge Sinclair), is being presented to the large gathering of animals by Rafiki the mandrill (Robert Guillaume), the kingdom's shaman and advisor. Mufasa shows young Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) the Pride Lands, explaining his responsibilities as king, and the ""circle of life"", which connects all living things. Mufasa's younger brother Scar (Jeremy Irons) plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba to become king himself. He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala (Niketa Calame-Harris), who are betrothed, into exploring the forbidden land. In the elephant graveyard, the lion cubs are attacked by three spotted hyenas, Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg), Banzai (Cheech Marin), and Ed (Jim Cummings), who are in league with Scar. Mufasa rescues them after being alerted by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu (Rowan Atkinson). Mufasa is upset with Simba, but forgives him, he tells him the great kings of the past are in the night sky, they will always be there to guide him, as he will be one day. Scar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge, while a stampede of wildebeest is driven by the hyenas to trample him. He informs Mufasa, who saves Simba but hangs perilously trying to climb out of the gorge. Scar refuses to save him and causes him to fall onto the stampeding herd. Simba finds Mufasa dead, Scar convinces him that this tragedy is his fault, and tells him to run away and never return. The hyenas are ordered to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride about the deaths of Mufasa and Simba, appoints himself as king, and allows the hyenas to live in Pride Rock. Simba has collapsed in the desert, he is rescued by friends and outcasts Timon the meerkat (Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa the warthog (Ernie Sabella). They take pity on him, telling him to put his past behind him, citing their motto ""Hakuna Matata"", meaning ""no worries"". Timon and Pumbaa allow him to live in their jungle paradise. Simba (Matthew Broderick) grows up as a carefree adult. Meanwhile the Pride Lands have been reduced to a wasteland under Scar's rule. Timon and Pumbaa are walking through the jungle singing ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"", when a hungry adult lioness tries to attack them. Simba fights her, but realises it is Nala (Moira Kelly) grown up. She and Simba reunite and fall in love. She urges him to return home, telling him that Pride Lands have been destroyed, feeling guilty for his father's death he refuses and storms off. He then encounters Rafiki, who discovered he was still alive, he tells him that Mufasa's spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, following this he decides to return home. Aided by Timon and Pumbaa, Simba sneaks past the hyenas and confronts Scar. He taunts Simba over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, there he reveals to him that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to tell the truth to the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fight against the hyenas, Scar tries to escape, until he is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Simba spares his life but orders him to leave and never return. Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to throw him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. Afterwards, the rain starts to fall, the other animals watch as Simba finally ascends Pride Rock and roars to announce his kingship. Later, Pride Rock is restored to its usual state, animals are gathered as King Simba and Queen Nala look over their kingdom, and Rafiki presents their new-born cub. Also starring Zoe Leader as Sarafina, Frank Welker as Lion Roars, Tony Jay as Hyenas, and B.J. Ward as Lions. The voice cast are all terrific, especially Jones as the father and Irons as the villain, the colourful animation is wonderful, the story inspired by biblical stories and Shakespeare's Hamlet is good, it makes you laugh and cry, and the songs composed by Sir Elton John and written by Sir Tim Rice are memorable anthems, a most satisfactory animated musical drama. It won the Oscars for Best Music for Hans Zimmer, and Best Song for ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" (also won the Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Song for ""Circle of Life"" (also nominated the Golden Globe), and Best Song for ""Hakuna Matata"", it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Original Score - Motion Picture. It was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, it was number 99 on 100 Years, 100 Songs for ""Hakuna Matata"", it was number 94 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons.

For some reason, I Just Can't Wait To Be King excels most on that. Hans Zimmer score is the greatest I've heard in my life. Thank God he took the Oscar home! This film is most tragic to me, and uplifting at the same time. It's sad that Disney will never ever make a film just like this again. But hey, they couldn't even if they tried!

A film that only get better with repeat viewings and age, The Lion King is a fantastic animated masterpiece that is among Disney's finest achievements. Stellar voice work, great musical score, beautiful to look at and emotionally complex and riveting. Questions which their parents will have to answer. Dad, is Mufasa really dead? Can this happen? He is the king!
The Lion King is a fun, often funny, and at some times tragic animation and some of the most iconic movie moments in cinema. The music in this film is just so iconic and no matter what generation you are a part of you have heard these songs more than once. n't really hear it.

While Mickey Mouse will always be Disney's flagship character, the princesses from these movies laid the ground work for what we know Disneyland to be today. I believe that the animals in the movies also offer a certain mysticism that contributes to the magic of what Disney and Disneyland is today. And like many other cartoon Disney movies, Lion King is a classic because of the plot, songs, and the art work. I would definitely recommend any child to see Lion King because it is always fun seeing a movie and then visiting the theme park where all your favorite characters live.",

294,1 February 2008,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8, Another of the Disney greats,"I've just watched this with the original voices, for the first time. Why is that, you ask, when there has been a purchased VHS copy of the film in my possession since around the time it was first released? The simple fact is that here in Denmark, we dub... anything that's made for children, or is considered ""family entertainment""(which is really just a word used to mask that something is made for kids, enough so that the teenagers and possibly some of the adults won't make a run for it the moment the suggestion of viewing it is said out loud before the family members). I'm not really in favor of it, I prefer the originals(sub, don't dub... the voice is one of the tools that an actor has, the sound a major part of a film, and through that, the director's work, and the actors and crew, for that matter), but hey, at least we're not France or Germany(good luck watching *anything* on German television that isn't in German, regardless of whether they made it or not). For that reason, the voices were some of what I noticed the most, along with the original dialog and lyrics to songs. Jonathan Taylor Thomas isn't bad at all. Broderick does good, though were it not for the animated form of his character, I'm not sure he would come across as strong as he does when he needs to... seriously, who could ever be scared of him? Of course, it could be the roles he seems to play often. Marin, Goldberg and Cummings make good hyenas. Irons is great. Guillaume(try spelling *that* three times fast) is marvelous. I didn't personally care much for Atkinson, but hey, I've always preferred his Blackadder(in particular after the first season/show) to his Mr. Bean(a character I don't find funny), and this is clearly done after the latter, not the former. Fans of Bean may very well enjoy the character(much like how Robin Williams fans might enjoy at least his part in Aladdin), and he's not the only one(not only for this Disney film, either) who bears strong similarities to their character, to the point where in many cases, it would seem(and sometimes they even say so) that the animators and such based the look and mannerisms on the actual actor/performer. I saved what may very well be the best for last... James Earl Jones. What can I say? The man almost invariably(in anything he appears in) has an undeniably commanding presence, and that is arguably mainly due to his voice, so casting him was a smart choice, and it pays off. The plot is well-written. The animation is quite good, with a bright, varied, colorful palette, and lively movements both in the camera and in the players. I didn't find this as energetic or funny as Aladdin, but it was still enjoyable. The music is magnificent, Can You Feel The Love Tonight is a fantastic song, and it's not the only one in the feature(to which that adverb can be applied). The DVD has some marvelous material, including music videos, a few deleted bits, some games(one of which isn't half bad), a Virtual Safari and featurettes regarding... just about everything you could imagine, regarding the film, including the stage production based off it, the music in it, even the animals. I recommend this, and its DVD release, to fans of the Disney animated musicals, and/or of any or more of the actors. 8/10",
295,12 May 2014,yahwehisagape,9, The Lion King,"The Lion King is acclaimed to be one of the best and if not the best Disney film of all time. Well lets find out. The plot of the movie is about a young cub named Simba and plans on becoming king, but when Simbas evil uncle Scar kills Simbas father Mufasa. Scar tells his hyena henchmen to run Simba out into the jungle and make him never return. Simba makes new friends in the jungle and decides never to return because he rather lives a life with no problems whatsoever. When his childhood friend Nala informs him that Scar has taken over Simba comes back and stops his evil uncle. I personally find the plot very interesting and exiting. It's like you want to know what happens next every moment. Now the moment that everyone remembers and one of Disney's most saddest moment is when Scar lets the stampede out to kill Mufasa. I mean come on haven't we got enough with Bambis Mom! Mufasas death in my opinion is more sad. The main reason is that with Mufasas death there are not any flying birds after it. With Mufasa they keep it silent like if its at a funeral So after watching this film its now clear to me why its called one of the best.

And there were tears, of course. The colours, theme song, animal movements - they're all perfect. I bought The Lion Kids DVD a few days ago, for my kids now, and I can say that the magic is still there. The themes are universal - love, family relations, betrayal, growing up...so everyone can relate to the story and feel the emotions. And the great thing is that it is not only appealing to children but to adults as well. The Lion King is a great mixture of singing and musical elements, appealing and cute animal characters, great animation, beautiful African landscape and serious themes of rivalry, betrayal and fratricide.",

300,3 February 2008,catarinafidalgo15,10, Not just some love story,"The Lion King is about a young cub, Simba, who is destined to be king of his animal kingdom. But his Uncle Scar has something to say about that since he's second in line for the throne. To prevent Simba from getting the throne, he kills Simba's father, Mufasa, and drives Simba out of the kingdom. Simba then meets Timon and Pumba who tell him ""Hakuna Matata"", no worries. But when Simba's old friend, Nala, comes to see him as an adult and tells him that Scar has destroyed the kingdom, Simba must confront his past and Scar to win back the throne!I believe this movie was a great tribute to all animation, and something that every movie should hope to accomplish. This movie I think is better than any other Disney movie simply because it is more ""real"" than any other one. It also has a lot more catchy music than films like Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast. One thing that really gets me mad is the whole ""too intense for young children"" thing that's been said about this movie for the past 13 years. Little kids can deal with death, they probably don't even understand it. This movie i think really has mostly cheerful moments mixed in with a ""real"" story. Not just some love story with problems. It contains everything from romance to action, from happiness to sadness. You cannot get enough of this film. Disney sure has done a great job on this film and it truly deserves the title ""A Masterpiece."" It seems that animated motion pictures nowadays lack the true epic quality that makes am movie memorable and try to make up for that lacking in weird attempts at modern comedy that appeals to a young audience. Disney's serious efforts in producing something extraordinary as in The Lion King are no longer showing.",

It does have its parallels with the old Egyptian myth of Osiris and Set, and Osiris's son Horus, but as a fan of animated movies, this is the one with all the best actors and actresses lending their voices.

We used to be taken to the AV Room of our school where we would watch this on a projector. We were only allowed to watch it till the period was going on, so I never saw it after the 40 minute mark. I could not even watch it anywhere else since we didn't have a TV at home (and even if we did what was the guarantee that this movie would be coming on it?) and internet wasn't as popular as it is today (although there are many reviews here dated before the time).

The only thing that I found a bit extreme was killing of Mufasa though to be fair I never found it that sad and I'd be lying if I said balled my eyes out as a kid, but overall, It was such a great movie that one scene like that really doesn't screw up the rest of the movie and that was probably the only thing in the entire movie that it would have been OK not to show. I Still lave the lion king to this day and I'm almost 21 years old and from the looks of I will love this movie until the day I die.",
307,4 July 2008,joychipmunk,10, Amazing Movie for all Ages!,"You truly have not seen an animated movie until you have seen ""The Lion King"". It is witty, exquisitely animated, and charming. The plot line is original and although I am well aware that it was copied from ""Hamlet"", as far as animated movies go, it was daring. Little Simba is absolutely the cutest animal ever, except for possibly Dumbo... While all of these factors have made it one of my favorite movies, there is one more that definitely separates it from all the other Disney movies, and that is the voice talent. James Earl Jones is wonderful as Mufasa as well as Jeremy Irons as the devious Scar. The bottom line is that you must watch this movie because it has a great message for younger kids, as well as a few jokes that children won't understand, for adults.",

Though the movie is rated G, some of the scenes my be too intense & disturbing for younger children. In this meaning, it is an outstanding movie, but in my opinion should be rated PG due to the fighting scenes and darkness of some death scenes. However, it's a great movie to share with the whole family. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be amazed! It's a classic for years & years to come.",

It captures the childhood memories you long for as you continuously grow older. It's simplistic ability to entertain and provoke joyful feelings is something rarely found in movies currently being made. The lesson of believing in yourself, and overcoming struggles is important for kids to learn. It teaches one about the ability to trust, but also to know that this world is not perfect. The characters will leave your stomach hurting from the laughter produced, and the songs will have you singing. The animation is nothing to be overlooked, and its rather perfect nature will leave you in awe. There is no contest that this movie will forever remain a classic.

There is no film like it or never will be. Animated or not, this film is the best in everything. Characters have been portrayed so well in their contrasts and similarities, each being unique. The story is about every theme - Paternal and Maternal Love, Romance, Comedy, Betrayal, Guilt, Redemption and Reclamation. I saw the new one, and believe me, it sucked totally. Wouldn't even come within miles of this film. The jungle book is even more lively than the new one in 2019.
Which brings me back to our Classic.
The music is so genuine, 'Circle of Life', 'Be Prepared', ' I Just Can't Wait To Be King', Hakuna Matata', 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight?' are so memorable. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is epic. The cinematography grips you from the moment you watch it till the end. The animation is so genuine and heartfelt. It gives me the chills, the song of 'Be Prepared'. Overall a classic for the ages.❤❤❤",

The Lion King is an amazing animated film with great music, great art, and an incredible plot with astounding voice-overs. I saw this moving pic. a hundred times and never got bored of it once. Of course most of the times I've seen it when I was much younger, but even now it does not fail to keep me listening and paying attention and being entertained. The movie is a great family film and I recommend it for every person out there who wants to get that inspiring rush, kind of like an aftershock, at the end of a great epic film or your favorite sports team winning an important game, if not ""the"" important game.

He runs away, only to meet new people and learn new outlooks on how to live life. I review this film in the mind of a child. It was warming to the heart, action packed (but not too much because you know, kids) and even enriching to the mind. Just what you want in a film for children, and what Disney generally delivers. It however does not have the magic that people are expecting in a Disney film, but that is not to be expected. It did not however make me feel as child like as other Disney films.

I think that it is quite educational for every person who watches that!Despite it analyzes an animal kingdom, you can easily locate a man society in which everyone tries to be on the highest level without calculating the other ones, no matter if they are relatives or friends or anything else. Important values presented in this movie such as friendship, co-operation, love, anti-racism messages and -of course- family! Last but not least, is the music of the film.

Each of us also laughed in every scene with Timon and Pumba. Two very different animals but this does not prevent them from being friends.

The story was about a young cub named Simba who wanted to be king, but after his father was brutally killed in the stampede by his vengeful uncle Scar, he runs away from homeland. The songs in the film were fantastic, but the scenes are very intense, violent, brutal, and bleak. I highly recommended all viewers ages 11 and up.",

I love how they show us many different morals in life in a unique way; like when Mufasa explains the circle of life to Simba and how we are all one. Also when Mufasa explains to Simba that There will be a time where he has to leave (death) and Simba would have to take over. Mufasa also shows that it takes great responsibility to be King and there are moments where even the brave get scared. It also shows that when we're young we get carried away with growing up and we want to change things when we grow up but when we get older then we realize the purpose on why it was the way it is. Finally teaching running away from your problems isn't the solution because it will catch up to you (when Nala goes to look for food in the oasis where Simba had been living since he ran away),

390,13 October 2010,Aaron1375,7, From a person who generally does not enjoy a Disney musical this one was pretty good.,"I know my score does not seem all that high, but trust me from me a seven is good for a motion picture of this type. This one, unlike many other Disney musical cartoons is a film I say was pretty good. The songs were okay and fit the story well and the animation was rather good and the story not all that bad either. The humor was funny, and though it got semi serious at times the flow of the film was good and never really bogged down even when it did tend to be a bit more on the sentimental side. The story of a young lion cub, who is the son of the lion that rules the valley is nice. You watch him progress through this life and you meet the villain Scar who hatches a plan to not only rid the valley of this cub, but the father as well who happens to be Scar's brother. He does this with help from the hyenas and after seemingly succeeding with getting rid of those two, he takes over the valley and lets the hyenas do as they wish. Well unbeknown to Scar, the son, Simba, has survived and he becomes friends with a couple of funny characters Timon and Pumbaa. They add a lot of comedy to the film and I really laughed at the scene where they sing their song as a distraction using Pumbaa as basically bait. So a nice movie that ends really quickly and is good even to a guy who usually dislikes this type of movie this one is a nice treat.",
391,19 October 2011,Redcitykev,8, Excellent use of 3D effects,"Being of a certain age, and without children, this is one of the classic Disney films I have never seen, but the opportunity arose to finally getting around to watching it when my mother, who is into her 80's and disabled, said she would love to see it. With the help of a very good friend, a veteran of the industry, we went to one of Bristol's (England) out-of-town multi-plexes and, for the grand total of £0.00 (or, if you like, $0.00!!!), sat back and waited for the fun to begin! The film is big, brash, colourful, and total predicable of course. Rightful pretender to the throne is framed by nasty old Scar, leaves, meets good friends, is persuaded to return, fights nasty old Scar, and Simba takes up his rightful place as King of the Pride. All very Disney, very good triumphing over evil, good guys getting their rightful dues, baddies getting their due comeuppance etc. What raises this above the level of most other animated films of this kind is the quality of the animation - quite superb - some great characters (the farting Warthog is fantastic, Scar suitably nasty, Simba proud and upright, etc), and some excellent songs - Circle of Life has, of course, become a children's classic song! The version I took my mother to see was the newly released 3D one, and I have to say that I was very impressed with how Disney had turned a 2D film into a film with great depth and scope. It did not always work as well as it could have, some scenes still looked a little flat, but certainly when the birds were flying overhead, or the camera was swooping down onto different characters, then the effects were excellent, and really added to the enjoyment of the film.",

405,18 June 2017,reshmasudhakar,10," ""The Lion King""- An epic animated movie","The Disney's ""The Lion King"" is an animated musical film directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff and produced by Dan Hahn in 1994. This movie was basically an inspiration from William Shakespeare's Hamlet. The Lion King, in my opinion, is an epic movie with a full package of adventures in life. It is a movie filled with happiness, love, family, emotions, lessons etc. The movie is generally based on the subject or theme 'Authority'. In the beginning introduction song, we can see that the entire forest bows down to one true dedicated King, Mufasa the Lion, as we all know, Lion is the King of the Jungle. The movie tells us the story of a King, Mufasa and his son, Simba who is the next king to be. After an unfortunate incident happened to Mufasa, Scar his brother guilty Simba into thinking that he was the reason for the incident. This makes Simba leave his kingdom and run away from his family. The journey of Simba succeeding his father's pride land is the movie, 'The Lion King'. 'The Lion King' is known as the Disney's best ever animation film and I couldn't agree more. To begin with, the voices done for every character suits their personality. The king, Mufasa's voice describe him as a king- strong and ruling, his brother and/or the evil uncle's voice has the grudge, just as his character in the movie. Zazu the bird's character is more toward the funny side so does his voice. The softness and humor in Rafiki's voice represented his character as a caring, fun-filled well-wisher. The roles that each character of the movie represents have done a great job in acting. Since it is a musical film, the voices have higher expectations and I believe that this movie has met with all the expectations. When it comes to animation, it is important to make everything seem so perfect, otherwise, it is easy to point out the mistakes. In that case, this movie has done its best job. I believe that no matter how great the story is, it wouldn't attract or reach the audience if the cinematography is a failure. We all have witnessed the grand success of the film. I would like to talk about the two techniques that I admired about the movie: camera angle, camera movement of the film. Camera angles were extraordinary in this movie. Starting from introduction scene, where Rafiki lifts Simba to show the world that the future king has been born, the angle was so perfect that along with the song, it definitely gives a goosebumps moment. The camera movement throughout the movie was an eye treat to the audience. Especially during the songs, the flow in the movement will definitely make everyone want to dance. Overall, 'The Lion King' has met with all the requirements for a fun-filled entertainment package.",

Simba is a young cub. Who idolizes his father, and must take his place upon his father's death.

416,30 April 2018,LimeLion,10, A Film that Animated Film Makers today should take notes from.,"Lion King is not only an animation masterpiece but a film masterpiece overall. The technique of cinematography and visual story telling used in Lion King is some of the best seen in Film. Each scene provides a purpose to strike an emotion within you. Complimented by the outstanding soundtrack, the story can be easily told without a word being said, although the characters voice actors and dialogue is just as good. The animation is fluid and beautiful and feels life like in every frame. Lion King is easily some of Disney's best two-dimensional animation work.",
417,26 February 2023,jadavix,10, Powerful masterpiece and a cultural touchstone,"""The Lion King"" was arguably THE animation event of the '90s. It has some pretty stiff competition from ""Toy Story"", ""Aladdin"" and perhaps also ""Beauty and the Beast"", and whereas those are all brilliant, ""The Lion King"" seems to be the most fondly remembered.",
418,12 August 2019,camerondiaznrob,10, Best animated film ever?,"Seeing the 2019 piece of cash grab made me appreciate this one even more. This is one that demands a viewing on a theatre screen. Saw it 4 times in theatres as a kid and it was an experience like no other. Gorgeous animation and visuals, Flawless voice acting, Hans Zimmer's epic score booming through the speakers. It is a work of art. Sadly Disney hasnt really come out with anything remotely close to this since, and probably never will.

420,19 March 2014,nzysman78,7," No bad, but it could be a lot better.","The Lion King isn't a bad film. It just doesn't have anything unique and the songs are annoying as hell. The story also has a ton of stuff that isn't explained. Why doesn't Scar kill young Simba after killing Mufassa. Why does Nala travel all the way to where Simba was living with Timon and Puamba. Why is there a drought, famine, and bad weather when Scar rules. There are like all these animals, so why don't they overthrow Scar. When Simba returns to face his actions, no one supports him until he finds out he didn't kill his father. Why does the land turn back to normal after Simba returns. This is probably the most overrated Disney film, but not the worst.",
421,10 June 2018,Lotusproduction,10," In June 1994, Disney unveiled what would become one of its most beloved animated titles, The Lion King.","From the stealthy array of talent selected to perform the voices, including such deep-tone stalwarts as James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons, one almost expects a tragedy in the Shakespearean tradition. And, in certain aspects, The Lion King does fit this bill. Instead of the house of Hanover or Stuart, the drama centers on the reign of the mighty lion Mufasa (Jones), the king of a perfectly balanced African kingdom of animals who thrive in stunning abundance. A beneficent monarch, Mufasa, raises his young male cub, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas, then Matthew Broderick as an adult) to know that ""we are all connected in the great circle of life.""",

Because it's Disney, it automatically has that quintessential cute factor, but The Lion King is also a powerful story. I love the theme in this movie - that while you cannot change the past, you should learn from it and take responsibility. The ending is one of the most powerful scenes. Even more, I love the characters. Who doesn't love Simba's courage (his childhood was definitely not ideal!), Mufasa's glory, Rafiki's quirky wisdom, and of course, Timon and Pumbaa's comic relief?",

It has action, comedy, adventure, emotion, drama and romance, what more do you need. A story of how a young lion cub is led to believe that he is responsible for his fathers tragic death manages to overcome his fears and guilt from the past and rise to save the kingdom of Pride Rock. Simba, the Son of King Mufasa, runs away from his home and makes friends with a Puma and Meerkat who teach him the ways of survival in the wild. Evil uncle, Scar, takes over Pride Rock and fills it with misery. When Simba's childhood friend/love interest, Narla, comes searching for food and stumbles upon Simba's whereabouts, a new turn of events brings hope to Pride Rock. A great film. 10/10",

It had a good plot and was not designed too throw children off. Like all children's stories there is a problem and then an arc and a solution. I think Disney did a good job keeping the feeling of grief too a minimum. It almost seemed as though they were outlining Simba's strength through the loss of Mufasa. As a child I watched many movies but none I enjoyed as much as the lion king. It makes kids think about life and responsibility. It is about having strength and courage when you don't think you do. It shows kids it is,never too late too fix a mistake even if it is in the past. I recommend this too anyone with kids or well anyone!",

The company holds credit for some truly all-time classics, such as the own 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', 'Cinderella', 'Sleeping Beauty', etc. But back in 1994, when 'The Lion King' came out, it seemed like Disney was losing its touch, without the magic of the movies in former times.

You are probably wondering what I am talking about, well I'm talking about the story and the way in which it was brought to the screen. The story, although being some sort of the typical good versus evil story is great. There is some real character depth and emotion in the story and it is brought to the screen in such a wonderful way, that I (21 years of age) actually shed a tear or two. Since I do not shed tears easily watching a film, I found it even more astonishing, that this animated feature succeeded in making me do so. The Lion King is not the kind of animated film that will make you burst out in laughter a lot, but rather an enchanting and moving story of love, loss and betrayal.

All the songs in Lion King and Beauty and the Beast beat any other movies with songs in them. The humor was great and well-done. Everytime I see Pumbaa talk, I always laugh. He had great jokes and same with Rafiki's jokes. The Lion King, as I said once before, is one of the best animated films. Everyone should see it!!",

It's dark, emotionally stirring, and hard to watch at times. It has a great story about revenge and although the plot isn't entirely original, the movie handles it so well that it didn't bother me. The intro is very memorable and it will forever be remembered as one of the best movie intros of all time. I'm not going to spoil anything but a particular characters death is handled so well that it made most people cry bitter tears regardless of their age. It's probably the most saddest scene for any animated film. Like most Disney animated films, it offered adult themes which makes it good and enjoyable for grown ups as well. With some Disney films my nostalgia wears off but with this film, it gets better every time I watch it. Its final act has more action then you'd expect to find in a Disney film. I did rather enjoy the ending scene. Also, it has one of if not the best movie soundtrack of all time too. It perfectly fit the mood and setting of the movie and it's pretty catchy.

Although it is a Disney movie, it is not just a movie for kids. You will enjoy this movie no matter how old you are. A classical plot, of course since it is inspired by Hamlet, can be easy to predict, but you will find all the little things and details combine together to make such a masterpiece. The opening - and of course the ending, the songs, Hakuna Matata, the lessons, the magnificent African view, the characters, the voice... The lessons in the movie is sure worth notice.

Everything we got in trailers and promotions perfectly encapsulated Jon Favreau's ""reimagining"" of one of the most acclaimed and successful animated films of all time. None of the characters in the trailers showed any tinge of emotion on their faces, and all of the clips were from scenes directly lifted from the original. That's what we were shown, and that's what 2019's The Lion King is. So it's really on us for giving it money and sitting in that theater for two hours. We're giving Disney our energy, and they've caught on that they don't need to deliver much on the product when we do.",
505,2 February 2020,renegadeviking-271-528568,9, The Lion King review,"""The Lion King"" is an incredible movie. I first saw ""The Lion King"" in the hazy days of 2003, and it left a lasting impression on me. I waited years to acquire my own copy of the film and revisit it, and it was well-worth the wait. So, why is ""The Lion King"" so awesome? Besides the near flawless 2-D and 3-D animation, and the spectacular soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, ""The Lion King"" feels well and truly unique, inventive and ambitious in the canon, being a cross between ""Hamlet"" and ""Bambi"" with lions in the Savannah. The Disney Renaissance formula is present in this movie, but it only ever adds to it and never makes the movie feel generic or predictable like it did with ""Aladdin"". When you think about it, ""The Lion King's"" story is actually pretty simple and basic: a prince is born to a good king, the jealous brother of the good king murders him to seize power and banishes the prince, the prince lives in shame for years until his friends find him in exile and convince him to come home, the prince fights his uncle for his birthright. And having a basic plot isn't always a good thing because it often equals a thin plot, but in ""The Lion King's"" case it works incredibly well in the movie's favor, because it gives the filmmakers all the time and space they need to give the movie everything in every department.",
506,8 September 2014,rajatdahiyax,8, A very beautiful animated movie!!!,"One of the most popular Disney animated musicals, The Lion King presents the story of a lion cub's journey to adulthood and acceptance of his royal destiny. Simba (voiced first by Jonathan Taylor Thomas, then by Matthew Broderick) begins life as an honored prince, the son of the powerful King Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones). The cub's happy childhood turns tragic when his evil uncle, Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons), murders Mufasa and drives Simba away from the kingdom. In exile, the young lion befriends the comically bumbling pair of Pumbaa the warthog (voiced by Ernie Sabella) and Timon the meerkat (voiced by Nathan Lane), he and lives a carefree jungle life. As he approaches adulthood, however, he is visited by the spirit of his father, who instructs him to defeat the nefarious Scar and reclaim his rightful throne. Borrowing elements from Hamlet, classical mythology, and African folk tales, The Lion King tells its mythic coming-of-age tale with a combination of spectacular visuals and lively music, featuring light, rhythmic songs by Elton John and Tim Rice, and a score by Hans Zimmer",

508,4 June 2023,TooKakkoiiforYou_321,8, Pretty Good for a Jungle Taitei and Jungle Emperor Leo remake,"Because let's face it, this is a very well done remake (better than the official one from 1989) of those two series by Osamu Tezuka sans the humans, with the linked ecological themes that were at the base of most of his work like Burakku Jakku toned down and with Darth Vader and Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones is always as awesome as it can get) as the protagonist's father, Whoopi Goldberg as one of the hyenas and a bunch of other acting celebrities whose voices I'm not particular familiar with since this is the first time I've watched this movie in twenty and more years and I watched it in its original release language which, of course, is not italian. As a Disney movie, which means a movie targeted to a very young audience and their families, it still perfectly works. The animation is excellent, the sound deparment is awesome, the only thing slightly off-putting is some of the voice acting of the main villain towards the end but whatever. Oh, and still elicits some emotional tears, I don't know if for nostalgia or what but it still does it. Just please don't ask Othello from this movie because you won't get it, it was not its aim to present you Othello or whatever kind of fiction people wrongly believe this to be based on but to entertain and it gets its job done. As the icing on the cake, I give this the same exact score I gave to the 1997 Emperor Leo movie, they're equally worthy of your time.",

544,6 April 2020,krational66,8, Father's love,"Simms is the little prince of the Lion Kingdom, and his father Mufasa is a majestic king.
However, Uncle Scar has long coveted Mufasa's throne.
To sit on the throne, the scar must remove the little prince, so the scar used various excuses to let Simba go out, and then waited for the opportunity to open the killing ring, but Mufasa was rescued immediately. After repeated calculations, Mufasa died tragically under the scar, and the scar ulteriorly persuaded Simba to leave. On the one hand, he was sent to kill him.
During Simba's escape, he met the witty Ding Man and the kind PengPeng . They raised Simba into a majestic lion and encouraged him to go back to the forest to restore his country. In the next battle to restore the county and save the people, Simba really grew up to be a strong man and understood the true meaning of responsibility.
From the beginning, Simba made a mistake and only talked to it with a long-term focus instead of really teaching him. It can be seen that it is really a treasure in the plan. Later, Simba didn't live up to his fathers expectations and developed the Glory Kingdom.
This story is a story about the reincarnation of life and the rise and fall of all things; it is a story about love, growth and self-redemption, and its connection is profound and powerful. In the vast and prosperous African savannah, all things endlessly, the birth of a life slowly opened the curtain of the drama, brush but soothing, rich and fresh. The fragrance of flowers and trees and the atmosphere of earth will bring the audience to this magical country.

I love the music and probably one of my one favorite soundtracks that I can think of. Visually it was a great meshing of technology and hand drawn animation. It really is epic in its scope and the opening scene is a perfect way of building the universe. Great movie with lots of great memories.",
558,14 April 2020,Dello_,9, One of the kings of animation,"""The Lion King"" is one of the greatest animated films ever made thanks to many important elements. First of all the characters are memorable even if they appear for a short time. Then the plot is interesting and it is about the circle of life: life and death but also generosity opposed to selfishness. All of this is possible through an impeccable animation and a great music (both the score and the original songs). I think that almost everyone has watched it at least once, if not where had you lived? Jokes aside, ""The Lion King"" has been a cultural phenomenon for a reason, it's very very good.",

The moving and emotionally-charged music, the whimsical yet striking imagery, the impeccable jokes and comedic timing, the romance, the tragic moments, the joyful childhood, the setting, the darker aspects, the expressions and line deliveries of every single character.

565,21 October 2006,ChibiChloe,10, The Greatest Disney Film Ever Made.,"Forget The Little Mermaid or Beauty And The Beast, this IS the greatest Disney film ever made. It contains all the warmth and fun that a Disney film should have. This is a genuine film, and no other Disney film could be any better. With a superb cast and 5 songs that will make you sing all day through, this is the real deal. Just a word of warning, if you have little 'uns watching this film, you should watch it with them; there are a couple of scary scenes and a death scene involved, so you may want to check this film to see if it is suitable for your kids at home. But to make up for not-so-nice parts, there's plenty of fun, for all the family. This IS the movie for avid Disney fans, and even people who don't really have a taste for Walt Disney films, this is the perfect family film. And how could we forget the lovable duo, the one and only Timon And Pumbaa! You will just want to watch this film over and over again, because of the purity this Disney film has. And if you're hungry for more Lion King antics, there's also The Lion King 2, Simba's Pride and The Lion King 1 1/2. But don't just take my word for it, watch it for yourself and experience all the magic of The Lion King.",

""The Lion King"" has given me so many wonderful memories and beautiful, indescribable past moods that I can't get bored of this movie, no matter how many times I watch it. ""The Lion King"" is one of the very few movies that let you experience the power, the thrill, and majesty. With its magnificent animation; lovable and delightful characters; wonderful songs; and emotionally moving and unforgettable story, ""The Lion King"" is and always will be among the greatest films of all time. Another thing that makes this a spectacular film is the many life-lessons you can learn from it, such as pursuing your responsibilities, and taking your place in the 'Circle of Life,' and the importance and splendor of the father-son relation.

571,3 May 2016,datautisticgamer-74853,8," Far from my favorite Disney movie and may, IMO, be very slightly overrated","Do not get me wrong when I say that I enjoyed this adaptation of Hamlet, with a few songs that I could remember (more than Aladdin, which boosted points), an emotional scene that would become a cliché in plenty of movies to follow, such as The Good Dinosaur, and some pop-culture references that, despite being somewhat out of place in a Tanzanian savanna, work occasionally (there are a few to less child-friendly films, such as In the Heat of the Night), and there was apparently a strong enough story to warrant a true sequel, an alternate timeline, two spin-offs, and cameos in plenty of other Disney productions. Compared to other animated films of 1994 (such as A Troll in Central Park), it is a major step up. However, now that I see it as my critic self, I found little enjoyment with Pumbaa other than the fascinating voice given to him by Ernie Sabella. While The Lion King isn't the first Disney movie to have restroom humor (Beauty and The Beast and The Great Mouse Detective had belching scenes), I was miffed by constant allusions to Pumbaa's issue with wind. When he tries to be funny in other ways, he can occasionally work, but I prefer Timon. Because of that issue, this is just outside the you-must-see category in the feel-free-to-check-it-out category.",
572,8 August 2022,IrateTyrant,9, Mild Lions or Wild Liars,"Today is my cat's birthday month. When I was 9 years old, I saw this in a theater with people in my family. It was late June; we were looking for a space to feel cooled off and to try something new and interesting. Sitting alone in the darkness, I left them behind as I was awestruck at the powerful story. Decades later, I am still happy to say that I never gave up on this film and the project it made for many generations of movie-goers of endearment and environmental consciousness. The remake and the stage play seemed to overshadow the simplicity of a moment that awakened in the original movie. This moment was pretty hard for me to understand at that age, as I was told I had been allergic to cats. Now, my best friend is my cat and my views on wildlife have matured. I'll always remember how the ""Circle of Life"" made me feel. One point that I'd bring up is that there are no humans in the story, here. Do animals belong in a world that humans cannot attend to, in the same way? As the Bible says, man has domain over animals, but I question if that is just our reversal to the problem of overcoming things which control humans. The solutions which are manipulated by organizations of men/women lead toward our suffering, nothing else. I will probably not rush to watch this movie again; but that is because too much of this movie's integrity is pushed by human re-interpretation of the natural balances of wildlife and animals around us that defy our interpretation. Disney's control of the movie industry is pushed far, and no solutions are found by turning on the same story again, and again. Movies these days are getting worse, and as streaming services and online purchases replaced (over-used) physical trading, the world suffered more from the same questions being asked and problems unanswered. For first-time viewers, this is magnificent.",

584,22 September 2014,byson5186,10, Most Positive Message Of Any Disney Film I've Seen,"I saw this movie just a few days ago on an old VHS tape my parents have at home, and absolutely loved it!! It is a great story and a feel good movie that you'll likely feel really happy seeing. What is great about this movie, well I feel like most Disney movies try to leave you with a good message. This movie has a few powerful messages, like one Timon and Pumba's song Hakuna Matatata, a message about no worries which helps Simba forget about what he had just faced earlier. It's really nice to hear messages about not worrying as songs like that help us forget some of our own worries. The other message this film leaves us with is responsibility. Simba gets used to an easy life and no longer considers being king, like he was looking forward to earlier in the movie as his responsibility. Can Simba be persuaded to go back to Pride Rock, or should he just continue living his easy worry free life with Timon and Pumba? So, yeah it leaves us with a positive message and it is in all a beautiful film. A film with just animals, there are no people in it. We get to see very beautiful scenery, especially in the beginning of the movie and lots of animals. The songs are really nice songs you'd want to listen to, and there is a great story involved. It's also great how this movie isn't computer animated like almost all the animated movies that come out nowadays are. It's nice to just see really great drawings of Africa and wildlife. It's been a huge success as it's one of the highest grossing movies ever and it even has more home video copies sold than any other film. It's timeless, and I'm sure most of you reading this review have seen it. If you haven't seen it, then see it it's a must see.

The lion king, released in 1994, was arguably Disney's most serious work. Stripped of its lighthearted comedy, and stripped of its musical flourishes, ""the lion king"" at its core is an old, serious storyline. Roger Ebert, a film critic, even called it ""too cruel for young children"".What makes a classic a classic is to a large extent that the story patterns of these classics are consistent with the development of human history as well as with human nature. In turn, these classics have shaped people's expectations through word of mouth: people are used to ending stories in which good triumphs over evil, the princess meets the prince, the prince regains the throne... History has become a classic in this countless retelling and adaptation, exaggeration and imagination.

Once was mufasa's death, simba's desperate cry, and once was simba's standing on the rock of glory at the end of the film, and everything came back to life. Of course, I may have been fascinated by those vivid images when I was a child. However, as I grew older and reviewed for many times, I found that the lion king not only brought me rich sound and color, but also deeply shocked my soul. The story is set on the African savannah full of vitality. The magnificent savannah sets off the profound themes of love, responsibility, growth and life cycle into a grand epic, showing a new and magnificent world, and letting us experience the life of love and adventure.

604,1 January 2004,Jeremy Bristol,7, Just some thoughts on Scar (possible spoilers),"This is probably why J.R.R. Tolkien was so against the use of allusions: has anybody noticed paradox of making Scar--through a song and dance routine, no less!--a Hitler-figure?  If he were really akin to Hitler, wouldn't he be creating a scapegoat race--or in this case, a scapegoat species--and run around killing all of them (or more likely having them killed) for the sake of the purity of the species?  Instead, he makes an agreement with the hyenas--who are hated by everybody in the pure Prideland--and actually honors his promise to them until the tide finally turns so far against him that he has no other way to survive than to finally make them the scapegoat. Also, Hitler was a great propagandist (I mean that in the most derogatory way possible), and I'm sure he built up the hatred against the Jews/gays/blacks/gypsies/etc. for a number of years before the genocides actually started.  As a propogandist, Scar makes a lousy Hitler (again, spoken sarcastically): he brings in the SS hyenas immediately, as if he expected them to suspect his murder of Mufasa and retaliate against him; instead (though in the script they don't) everyone should have suspected him, as his little speech and the sudden appearance of the hyenas could only have been planned well ahead of Mufasa's death (*smack*smack*smack* quick round of knocking the lions' heads together for their stupidity).  Someone as slick as Scar is supposed to have been should have known better than that; it is only the sheer dumbness of the lions and their supposed fear of the pitiful little hyenas that allows his assassination/coup to come off without a hitch.

But I do know that for as long as I can remember this movie has been my favorite movie ever. I have a collection of lion stuffed animals and my favorite animal is to this day the lion. This movie has even impacted how I want to spend my life when I get out of school. Before I found out about the Broadway production of this play, I didn't know anything about theatre, but because The Lion King was made into a Broadway adaptation, I have developed a love for the theatre. While I still haven't fulfilled my dream of seeing the stage adaptation of this movie, I do have a passion for other parts of theatre, both being on stage and off and plan to major in performing arts in college. I fully believe that if it were not for my love of this movie that I would not have this passion today. The movie itself though is, in my opinion, the best Disney movie every. It has a wonderful plot that draws from classic inspirations and has some of the deepest and most motivated characters in the Disney franchise.",

All in all, it's worth buying but if you want the best movie out there, you might want to buy another movie. The animation is really great though. Watch the willdebeest running while Simba runs as fast as he can. If you have surround sound, it will sound like you have animals running through your living room. I guess what I find to be weak parts to this movie is the fact that it couldn't have a better script than Toy Story or Hercules. Where's the comedy??? All the voices are done pretty good and Jeremy Irons was really good as the menacing villian. It's good if you have nothing better to do on a sunny or rainy afternoon.",

A tour-de-force vocal cast includes the amazing voice of James Earl Jones, the ever so human voice of Matthew Broderick, the vicious, sarcastic and calculated voice of Jeremy Irons, and the humourous antics of Nathan Lane.

It was one of the first movies I ever saw, so that accounts for how much I love it. The animation is superb, the backgrounds look so rich, and for once, there are no stiff movements. The highlights were the stampede and the fight between Scar and Simba. The music by Hans Zimmer is outstanding, a perfect mix of African chants and pure Hollywood. The songs are absolutely great, I had no idea that Elton John could write like that. The best song is ""Can you feel the Love Tonight?"" but the others go without fault, ""Circle of Life"" is so spirit rousing especially. Likewise with the voice overs. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is very likable as Young Simba, and Matthew Broderick, while not as good, is above average too. James Earl Jones lends his booming voice to the majestic King Mufassa, and Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg provide flawless comic relief. The vocal standout is Jeremy Irons as Scar, who frightened me when I was little. Scar is up there with the best Disney villains, like Jafar, Malificent and Frollo. The humour here is fantastic, and you cry here a bit here as well. I highly recommend the stage version in the West End, and the sequels are actually two of the better DTV sequels.10/10.

624,25 September 2000,pmcollectorboy,8," Great Disney, but hardly their best","This movie is so popular that many people are calling it Disney's best. It is a great and energizing movie, but it is hardly the best. Overall, the movie does its job right, and it does it well. It's dramatic. It makes you laugh, and it makes you cry. But take a look at the story. It's thin, short, and rather shallow. And the main character does hardly anything to further the plot of his own story. A lot of time is filled with the usual bad humor and big songs. I'm not saying The Lion King is a bad movie. Pocahontas was a bad movie. For the most part, The Lion King makes up for this flaw by having a certain scope and grandeur and an incredible ambience and score. But an average story hardly makes The Lion King one of Disney's greats. How do I know? The Lion King, too, used to be my favorite. Then as it got older and I saw more and more Disney movies, The Lion King's charm faded. In fact, two quiet little classics, The Fox and the Hound and Bambi, were the first animated movies to bump The Lion King off my favorites list. Those have much stronger stories and are what I believe to be great Disney. For The Lion King, I give it an 8.",

The story is about a lion cub named simba played by Jonathan Taylor Thomas (young simba) and Matthew Broderick(grown up simba) who one day will rule his lands but in order to do he must respect, obey and be responsible to his father Mufasa. His uncle scar voiced by Jeremy irons is a wrongful and evilly valiant lion. Pumba and tamone are the perfect comic relief for a Disney film. There come up with two words Hakuna Matata which means no worries. Simba gets introduced to them when he runs away from home and his father dies after a wild animal stampede. Simbas love interest is nala. Nala is a young female lion. This movie has some intense scenes that are sometimes scary for the little ones.

640,14 February 2021,judemcrobbie,9, A Timeless Classic,"The soundtrack speaks for itself. It's not just the headline numbers that are exquisite, the score in total is extraordinarily good. Obviously you know the headliners such as 'Circle of Life' and 'I Just Can't Wait to be King', if you don't you have been living under a rock for the last 25 years. Personally I think three catchiness and just. All. Around brilliance of the songs are what elevated this movie to the height it is now. Don't get it twisted though this movie, even without the songs, would be some of the best all time. The thing that makes the score so amazing is the seeming revolutionary techniques used. These techniques from African countries, such as full choirs with little to no backing and using tongue clicks and other non-tonal devices for rhythm. This score has been influential to other movies, namely another Hans zimmer composition, The Dark Knight Rises (2012), which it's main theme is purely singing, showing the clear parallel.
The opening is genuinely one of the best, sure to give you chills. This is not only because of the nostalgia, but also the animation and song playing. It also introduces you perfectly to Pride Rock, which is perfect for children and adults alike.
The voice acting is tremendous throughout, but it is also quite dumbfounding how actors that have played such iconic characters can seem so disconnected from them. This is especially shown through James Earl Jones, who in this movie plays Mufasa, but has probably the most iconic voice in all of cinema. Who doesn't know what Darth Vader sounds like? This is a testament to his acting ability as you recognise the voice slightly but ultimately doesn't suck you out of the movie as it usually would.
Considering this was 1994, the animation is terrific. There is a bit at the end, where they are in slow motion that doesn't hold up to the rest of the movie. I won't pretend to be an expert in animation but I would probably guess that it's considerably harder.
The themes preached through this movie are great for children to learn about honour and responsibilities. It's also has eerie parallels to Shakespeare's Hamlet as it discusses the moral impact of killing. This helps the older audience to stay interacted into the movie and really sticks in your mind for days.
It''s truly thee quintessential children's movie, teaching children key themes necessary to growing up and on top of that its just a quality movie that anyone can level with and thou Riley enjoy, no matter the age.

650,5 August 2016,allyball-63124,9, Classic Disney,"Ah The Lion King. The highest grossing hand drawn animated movie of all time and the former highest grossing animated movie ever. As a kid, I absolutely adored this movie to the point where it was my favorite movie ever. However, nowadays, my reaction has kind of waned. Now don't get me wrong, I still love this movie but I will admit that there are better Disney movies. My main problem with this movie is Timon and Pumbaa. The fart jokes are obnoxious and I just didn't like their personalities. They feel like they're the same annoying character in 2 bodies. Even if your do like them, they kind of break the mood. Think about it. They're introduced maybe 10 minutes after Mufasa's death with their stupid fart jokes and dumb song. That's another problem with this movie. Hakuna Matata, while I do like it as a catchphrase, is an annoying song. Timon and Pumbaa cannot sing, the song is all over place, it goes on for way too long and it just comes in too soon after Mufasa's death, which was a really big thing for kids back then. Speaking of that, yeah, his death was a big surprise when the movie came out and it messed up a lot of kids for life. Plus the fact that they show the dead body! The story itself is very dark and almost adult. For example, they really emphasize how harsh life in the Pridelands is under Scar's reign. Another great thing about this movie is obviously the animation. It's hand drawn Disney animation and it looks incredible. However, what sets the animation apart from other Disney animation is just how big the movie is in scale. The 3D release for this movie was absolutely phenomenal. Everything was so much bigger and things were literally flying off-screen by the audience. I still remember the moment where Zazu flew by the audience at the beginning of the film. I actually flinched to the side because of how close it was. The characters in this movie are all very likable, outside of Timon and Pumbaa. In fact, the other comedy reliefs, the hyenas and Zazu, are much funnier, much more likable and much more timeless. Overall, I do love this movie despite it's quirks.",

It's my favorite Disney film (although Mary Poppins comes pretty darn close), and as I watched it throughout the years, I was not only astonished by the film's unforgettable plot and characters, but by it's morals, outlooks and philosophical meanings.

Today, I watched the movie without much anticipation, since I was aware of much of the movie. But, I was amazed by it, the way it is presented, which suits both children and adults. The tale of Mahabharata is identical to the plot. The king who lost his kingdom by the betrayal of his cousin, his wandering days through forest along with his brothers and wife, his comeback and the great war. We Indians values our epics, and they say every story is rooted on Mahabharata. As for Lion King, the depiction of our saga was a brilliant one. Classic Disney treatment helped it to capture the essence of pride. ",

The way how Simba comes back and take over what is really is and take the name of king will really touch you.

I still remember my brother and his pregnant girlfriend taking me to see this and I kept praying and thinking ""please don't let her go into labor during this film"", didn't want to miss this instant classic. Even at 17, I still remember purchasing this on DVD with a bunch of rolled up quarters I grabbed from my dads coin stash.

The narrators have given life to the characters through their graceful voices. This movie was a benchmark for all the animated cartoons featured later in the history of films. The movie revolves around the emotions of father lion towards its cub and vice versa. This movie is definitely one among st the favorites of 90's kids. I was really moved and touched by the climax sequence and the scene where the dad lion will be assassinated.Though there are sequels made, my favorite still remains this one.",
675,10 May 2020,DemonKiki,9, Love and courage,"When the film started, the music sounded, and the grand opening continued, and a sense of solemnity emerged. This is the opening of the most powerful animation I have ever seen.
This movie is the most serious work produced by Disney Animation. It is an animated version of ""Hamlet"". It is a very meaningful animation that children and adults should watch with heart. Family, friendship, love, and affection are touching; equality, discrimination, slavery, resistance, and terrification; birth, death, happiness, sadness, and rebirth. Coupled with the perfect style of painting, highly infectious soundtrack, and the director's balance of seriousness and humor in the plot, it has become a milestone in the history of animation, the king of classics.

Its just as funny as it is awe inspiring with it's epic animation all carried by a story that could be considered Shakespearean like. If you grew up in the 90s and didn't see this film as a young kid, your life isn't as complete as you may think. Those same 90s kids today have a responsibility to show this to your kids.

678,30 September 2009,moviecritichank-7,10, A Crowning Achievement for Disney,"From the amazing sunrise for Simba's birth to the incredible and breathtaking climax, Disney's The Lion King is not just an amazing animated film, it is one of the greatest movies ever made! It is the story of a young lion cub named Simba (voiced by Jonathan Taylor Thomas from ""Home Improvement"") who is destined and ""Just Can't Wait to be King"" of the jungle. After his father and king at the time Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones from ""Star Wars"", ""Field of Dreams""), is thrown into a wild stampede of wildebeests and killed by his evil uncle Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons from ""The Time Machine""), Simba is thrown into exile by him and believed to have been killed by the hyenas. Then, he meets two hilarious characters that provide the comic relief to this dark film; a zany meerkat named Timon (voiced by Nathan Lane from ""Mouse Hunt"") and his kind warthog companion named Pumbaa (voiced by Ernie Sabella) and he adopts the ""Hakuna Matata"" lifestyle, while forgetting his true destiny; go back to Pride Rock, defeat Scar and restore the Circle of Life. Along the way, he reunites with childhood friend Nala (voiced by Moira Kelly) and meets a wise old baboon named Rafiki (voiced by Robert Guillame) that remind him of his true destiny and leads to one of the greatest climaxes you will see in any film. The Lion King has everything an animated feature should have: great story, nice songs, dynamic music score, amazing animation, memorable characters (my favorite is Pumbaa), an edge of your seat ending, and a life lesson that anyone can apply to their life. This movie also has in my opinion the best voice cast for any animated film. Lion King is a film that everyone should see and own for you and your family to enjoy (I still have my VHS Copy of the film). Not my favorite animated film (the honor goes to ""A Goofy Movie"") but definitely in the top 5! Rating: A roaring 10/10!",
679,9 January 2015,t-hf,8, A retrospective review,"When this movie was first released, it was less a movie and more of an event. It was the biggest thing that Disney had made up until that point and for many reasons - the voice cast was made up of a-listers (Matthew Broderick, Rowan Atkinson, James Earl Jones, the list goes on), the songs were being sung worldwide, the story was epic and most of all - it held and still holds a special place in all of our hearts and childhoods.",

The story about a young  lion cub, Simba, the heir to the throne of the jungle-Pride Rock and his journey upto there is beautiful. This is one movie you just can't miss.

This is the best movie ever made before lion king II and Frozen! And it was the best movie since Aladdin at that time. This movie is suitable for the ages 6-11 as there is some violence, and it is more suitable for younger kids. I love this movie and it will never be forgotten in my lifetime. I rate this move a 10/10 for loads of thinks like: the animation, the entertainment , characters, adventure (adventure movies are my type of thing) and of course the presentation the owners made while making this awesome movie!

This movie holds adult jokes that go right over kids heads and make them wonder why their parents are laughing. The main villain (Scar) is by all rights the best Disney villain. He is sarcastic, sympathetic, and just straight up evil. The hero (Simba) is lovable although not sympathetic, his side-kicks more than make up for what he lacks. Timon and Pumba are funny, classic comedy relief characters. They lead Simba through adulthood teaching him Hakuna Matata (do no quote me on the spelling).

699,23 May 2016,iswimlikeagirl,10, This Movie is a Must Watch for Everyone No Matter your Age,"The Lion King is a timeless classic that should be shared with every generation. The evident message of freedom from the past and finding the strength to move on is something that so many people not only need to be told can happen but can see it happen. With all the colorful scenery and talking animals it's easy to get lost in the magic and wrapped up in child-like awe. From the rising of the sun to the echoing roars that fill your hearts with hope, there isn't a single moment of boredom or loss of interest. The first time experiencing the fun playfulness of Nala and Simba in an attempt to lose Zazu and sneak off the elephant graveyard will make you think Mufasa's tone is a little too strict for the situation. But as the conversation between the two lions continues it becomes evident that Mufasa's only concern is his son's safety and comprehension of what a big responsibility being king really is. Simba's uncle Scar hatches a plan to murder Mufasa and blames Simba for the ""accident."" This sadly is a representation of how many children and teens will see a negative situation. Unfortunately they see it as their fault and like Simba they run away from their past thinking that once it's behind them they never have to face it again. The thing is, like Nala found Simba, a person's past will always find them. They can either choose to continue running, which usually doesn't last long (another situation also represented by Simba), they can face it with only the people from their past that still love them (Nala), or they can trust a little and let in the people from their past and present and accept help from them all. There are so many life lesson's in the Lion King and the fun songs and goofy comments from Scar are just what wraps it all up in a nice neat bow.",

We learned about right and wrong and the importance of following your heart. t has everything from youthful naiveté to unforeseen loss and betrayal, all things we face in life.

I think it's a perfect film for all ages. Here's why... 1)It teaches you life lessons- when mufasa teaches young simba about the circle of life, it's probably one of the most important scenes out of any movie I saw. it plays a role that sets up how Mufasa rules his kingdom (respect for all) and Scar (well let's kill our dinner and destroy the circle of life). Hakuna Matata is wayy better than YOLO & if something's bad happens, I use this motto to cheer me up. You don't see good life lessons in modern animated movies (well not up and PotF) 2)The score is FANTASTIC! it's just as good as hunchback and way better than aladdin (I love that movie). The songs are amazing and they stay true to the themes and the culture of Africa 3)Mufasa- he's the Atticus Finch of Disney. They respect everyone no matter if they are different from them. they could probably be best friends! 4)Scar- GREATEST Disney VILLAIN EVER!! Like who would actually succeed for a long time besides Frollo from HOND?? Nearly no one. And scar actually kills someone! 5)People say this is a violent movie. umm not really except when simba & scar fight 6)The animation is flawless. It's not messy or overdone; has great contrast and tone & the characters are well drawn I could ramble on about this, but I shouldn't. this IS the definition of a 90's movie.

That is until Scar, Simba's uncle (voice of Jeremy Irons), selfishly intervenes. With Mufasa, Simba's father (voice of James Earl Jones) out of the picture, Simba believes that Scar's doings are all his fault as he retreats to the desert. In the desert he finds an oasis where he befriends Timon and Pumbaa (voices of Nate Lane and Ernie Sabella). Simba, (voice of Matthew Broaderick), grows up as years pass and Scar is ruling over the Pride Land in the place of Mufasa. Living in the poor conditions Scar has provided Nala, a friend from Simba's childhood (voice of Moria Kelly), sets out to find the lost Prince. Once she discovers what Simba has retreated to, she begins to talk sense into him and brings him home to reclaim what was rightfully his. ",

I also love the sing-along version of this film!!! I must say as a bit of a Disney connoisseur you can't top this in my opinion! Good story line and moral to the story!!!

743,5 April 2018,viniciussantosanjos,10, Life changing,"The Lion King is a movie about teachings, it can, and probably will, change your life for good, if you really understand what it is about, wich is very easy, you will talk with your familly with a different way, you will valorize them much more, your familly and friends, just everybody you trully like and love. It shows that our passing through here will end, we born, learn, grow, conquer and go away, it's like the Circle of life. There are dialogues during the movie that teaches how to handle mourning, that calm down and really help people that are struggling with something rough. As we accompany Simba on his journey to become a true King, we gonna feel in our on skin, the rage that some characters pass, the true sadness as if we have lost a friend or a relative, that really maked me cry so hard that my face got bugged, the happiness of a true friendship that makes me laugh and feel so well. It's a mix of emotions in their most sincere way.
The movie works 100% both for kids and adults, having aspects that they both gonna take and will touch their feelings. A very important quote on the movie, that is even more important for kids, is that you have to obey your parents, you have to trust in them, otherwise you gonna put yourself in danger and with problems. There is one specific moment that Simba say to Mufasa that they gonna play together forever, and Mufasa just say and prepare his son to his death, showing for us also, that one day our loved ones also gonna go, but at the same time it declares that they gonna live forever on the sky and will always be watching for us, very emotional and important moment. And later on the movie, Simba look at a reflection of himself and se his father, showing that our ones that are already gone will always live in us forever and be part of everything that we are.
Another very important matter that will impacts in literally all of us, independent of the age or anything, is about the past. Sometimes we need to change, wich is good, but is hard, because of our past most of the time, that we runs away from it. And we have to choose if we gonna run away or face it and learn with it. Also that you can't forget who you are and from where did you came from, DON'T FORGET WHO YOU ARE. Confront your guilt, assume your role in life and grow, mature. Face what there is new in life, not fear it, but go into it.
The characters Timon and Pumba are just genious, just like that, two great philosophers, all about the Hakuna Matata thing, is a thing you take for your life, that bad things happen, but head up and keep going, a not worries, problem-free.. maybe true happiness.
Even with all that said, all the things that it teachs that are completely necessary for life, it also have a great story, cleary based on Hamlet and Kimba for example, even if Disney don't admits it, with great characters every single one having their purpose that are all perfectly done and interpretate. The viusuals are all great, the visuals are stunning, showing the hole environment. They introduced a lot of animals, showing how some respect the king, how some hate it, show that some animals are marginals, they don't rock with the rest of the forest, demonstrating that some places are nice and others aren't, it is all much well done in just 1h30min. all worked out. With possibly the best prologue ever made. It shows the time passing, the transition between Simba kid and adult, happens in a brillaint way, inserting into the music, it is natural, doesn't seem any strange or wrong, you can feel the time. The villain is great, you see how Scar is moved by jealousy, he does his wickedness with something behind it all, he is frightener and you will hate him, he is pure evil and manipulative, when he shows up, the colors refers to hell, with red collors, and sometimes refering even to nazism, Scar is that big one as a villain.
Now the soundtracks are phenomenal, Hans Zimmer did a job that is at the same level as the entire movie, it just makes it even more great, the song will talk to us during the hole movie in a way that really a very few movies does, will make us scary or even more sad than we already were because of the scene for example, in some moments of dialogue he takes the violin into a hole other level that the music kind feel like is one with everything, is perfect. The musics are phenomenal and so memorable, that you just don't stop singing never ever in your life again, once that you watch it in any language, it will be stucked in your mind, together with all the feelings of the moments. The musics pretty much help to give us an entertaining teaching, all the musics lycris have a meaning that will help you to get all thoose teaching that i did mentioned before.
The Lion King is one of the movies that is just necessary for you to watch by yourself, and principally to watch with your kids, once that you got kids, watch it with them, multiple times, it will make their lifes more complety and understandable.",

I felt for Timon and Pumbaa ever since I first watched this movie in theaters in 1994. The hyenas were mean to Timon and I used to hate the hyenas for it. This movie is about taking responsibility and that is the moral of the film. I also learned not to worry too much from Hakuna Matata and I have a tendency to worry about things that I like a lot.

The first time I saw it, I cried twice, once when mufasa died and simba cried out in despair, and once when simba stood on the rock of glory at the end of the film and everything came back to life. The story is set in the African savannah full of vitality. The magnificent savannah has set off the profound themes of love, responsibility, growth and life cycle into a grand epic, showing a new and magnificent world and making us experience the life touched by love and adventure. This connotation transcends any culture or country, because human beings cannot change the laws of nature, and love is the emotion that human beings always pursue.

So simba runs away, and Scar sends some hyenas after Simba to kill him. Simba gets away from them, of course. Simba meets Timone and Puumba who take care of him. Simba grows up and meets an old baboon named Rafiki. Rafiki tells Simba that he knows his father. Simba doesn't believe him because his father is dead. There is a scene where the clouds take the shape of Simba's father and it says to him ""In forgetting me you have forgotten who you are."" Or something along those lines. After that Simba meets Nala, one of his old friends. She asks him to come back to Pride Rock with her. He says no. This movie is appropriate for all age groups. I really enjoy watching this movie.

I find the music to be extremely forgettable, if not downright irritating at some points, and the plotline erratic.  And don't get me started about the nonexistent love story which we are supposed to buy.

Even now, as I'm 20 years old, this movie touches me in a way very few movies do. The movie takes you through the journey of a young lion to adulthood, the royal throne, the lessons he learns throughout his journey and the different situations that he goes through that ultimately makes him a better person (I guess you could say 'lion' here). What I love about this movie (and what I subconsciously loved about it as a kid) is how much this movies teaches us. This movie is filled with moral lessons (""Hakuna Matata"" for example) that we can all, no matter our age, learn from and relate to.",

I was but a mere child at the age of 13, however, I was so enthusiastic about this movie. The music, the animation, the drama, the raw emotion. Everything within this movie was something to truly behold. Sometimes it'll jerk a few tears, other times you will be filled with glee and excitement. Because of the success of this movie, many Lion King-based communities have been erected in honour of this masterpiece of Walt Disney.

Simba is then found by Timon and Pumba, a spectacular duo. Simba lives with them for awhile, until Rafiki comes in and helps Simba regain the true identity of who he really is. The story is well developed, and it's enjoyable for the whole family. The movie has an interesting soundtrack with an African twist. The voice acting was done well with all the characters. The animation was well done, but then again, this was a theatrical movie and it was still considered the old Disney. In other words... this is The greatest Disney movie of all time.",

829,27 January 2021,cortinalcaraz,10, An undefeated classic,"This is, to this day, the most perfect movie of Disney. The Shakespearean movie is probably the most heartwarm film of this company that outdid itself with this one.
Isn't it amazing how a performance in an animated movie can give you goosebumps?
Even though all the great aspects of the film, I would say Jeremy Irons finds a way to steal the show, encarnating the heartless Scar, an abandoned brother who gets his revenge.
The music is amazing, the rest of the cast is also good, the screenplay hooks you into the movie from the beginning (thanks to Shakespeare), and even the cinematography (which is ridiculous to say, given the fact that we're talking about an animated movie).
To sum up, this movie is almost perfect in ever sense, though some things could be lightly improved (the animation for example).",

832,3 August 2022,seanmorkikawa,7, Courage,"The cell-shaded 2D animation of the wide range of animals combines easily with the matte painted backgrounds which add visual depth and beautiful scenery in likes of waterholes, mountain ranges, lush forests and waterfalls. The foreground and background blend seamlessly and the world of The Lion King is endlessly alive and breathing even with its limited selection of camera movements. It's at once more inviting than the relatively sterile 3D environments of some more modern Disney works (Big Hero 6 comes to mind). The film's soundtrack is similarly impressive. Elton John and Tim Rice combine to bring five original songs that still draw applause, recognition and sing-a-longs even two decades later. The opening Zulu choral vocals of The Circle of Life are powerful and evocative, while the animated choreography that combines with I Just Can't Wait to Be King makes for a jaunty upbeat tune. Hans Zimmer's score goes from strength to strength, drawing upon traditional African choral themes and percussion which resonates during the film's emotional moments.",
833,5 July 2009,big_bea,10, still great after all those years,"I think this movie was the first film I ever saw at the cinema. That was 15 years ago, and I was five years old. I was so excited about the whole film and I loved it. Today, I watched the film again. It still held the same magic, made me laugh and sad at the same time and I still love the soundtrack. Many films lose with time whatever it is that make them special to us, but this movie definitely isn't one of them. I heard people say that the story is to cheesy, but this is a Disney production, so what do you expect? Either you love those films, or you hate them. Other's say the storyline is badly developed. I just don't know what they're talking about. Sure: one knows how this film will end, but that doesn't make the story bad, considering the genre. The characters are well drawn, and the film holds a maturity that might be considered misplaced in a movie made for kids. But it isn't: there is a simple lesson you understand as a child, and a conflict in Simbas soul you will appreciate as an adult. I just can say that I still love this movie as much as I always did. Some of the reasons for this may be different now, but some of them are still the same, and I am very grateful that I can still enjoy some things I loved as a child just as much as an adult. If you haven't seen this film yet, you should give it a try. It wont disappoint you. If you've got children, they will have a great time watching this movie.",

He was deceived and hatred by his uncle's scars in childhood because he was simple and not aware of his complicated ambitions, and he wandered on the charge of ""killing his father""; when the body and mind were tired, the coming of friendship gave him new hope and vitality. Under the unraveling with Ding Man and Peng Peng, I realized the joy of life and the preciousness of friendship; and when I met again with my childhood companion Nana, I became brave and mature after learning the evil deeds of my uncle's scars; In the decisive battle, the king's style is more reflected... In all these experiences, I seem to have seen myself. From simple childishness to mature self-confidence, the things I experienced have the same things. If people are not deceived, they cannot understand the anger of being deceived; if they do not experience the hardships of wandering, how can they know the preciousness of the warmth brought by friendship; if they do not experience the struggle of fate, who can prove their potential ability? I can naturally resonate with his life. Maybe what life needs is such a little setback and bumps in growth.

I have not watched it since about 1997 so why do I believe myself to be in a position to comment on a film I barely remember watching? I remember the way it made me feel as I sat in the cinema. I freely admit that I cried when Mufassa died and cannot recall a second in the film that did not either amuse or move me. I am severely irritated by those who complain that the film is too scary and overrated. The film is not for you!!! It is so easy to inspire emotion in a little child and Lion King did so much of that. People who watched the film when they were 26 and complain about the 'lack of intricacies in the subplot' or the 'lack of consistent character development' should check themselves into a mental asylum. I guess I haven't watched Lion King for so long because i want to maintain the effect it had on me as a child. This is by far the most overly sacharrine thing i have ever written in my life but its for a good cause. Lion King forever.,

Although scar was a king but the bad spirit inside him,made everything be so miserable.

I would give it a negative number if I could. HYENAS KILL LIONS! I just hate it. TIGERS ARE THE KINGS OF THE BEASTS! NOT LIONS! I have to say, I was very disappointed, the only good thing was the music. Honestly, I wish those lions starved to death and I am glad that simbas father died. I hate Disney for making people hate hyenas. I LOVE THOSE GUYS! They are AMAZING! In fact, I like them better than humans! I just can't wait to be king. To bad you will have to wait forever. By the way, wildebeest can not trample and ADULT MALE LION! Way to go on the details there. Disney has to make a movie about hyenas being good because honestly, hyenas are not more evil than humans.

I've probably watch it 10 times throughout my life and still it prevails as the best of all time. It has lots of different emotions which is part of life.

But now, when I watch, I truly understand the depth of the story, and the humorous parts as well. It is not a laugh out loud movie, but it is definitely humorous, with lots of little jokes thrown in, such as when Zazu offers to sing It's a Small World and Scar implores him not to. James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, JTT, basically everyone was great. Jeremy Irons was superb. This sycophant role was one he was born to play. Whoopi Goldberg is also very funny, and Cheech Marin puts on an underrated performance. Nathan Lane being a secondary character is great as well for a few laughs.

Without Scare killing his brother, Simba wouldn't have met Timon and Pumba. I love them. Timon and Pumba are so funny. They make the movie complete. * If you didn't see this, this is a movie that you should must see.

This one is a little more grim than the two previous Disney classics (little mermaid & Beauty & the Beast) but in the end it works wonders with your emotions.

Its a shame Disney is not that popular today in the 0's (with Shrek and CGI animation taking over the screen- i'm not criticising Shrek its great!) TLK can be seen as a modern day version of Shakespeares' Hamlet. A brother (Scar) kills his king brother (Mufusa), Simba the future king (Hamlet) listens to the advice of his father's spirit. I first saw TLK when I was in primary school at the age of six and it made me cry! I watch it now with my younger sisters and still think its a masterpiece. TLK is a great movie because of the songs and the animation(its more clear bright compared to the older Dinsey classics.) It also has memorable characters with a great cast, Whoopi Goldberg, Jeremy Irons, Matthew Broderick. I do not think its sequels can beat it but they are still good. Timon and Pumbaa light up the screen and its the first Dinsey film to contain more action. (Fight scenes). TLK is my favourite Disney animation as it was of the first films I saw in the cinema, its more personal as I can relate it to my childhood memories. 10/10 for children 9/10 for adults 9/10 for me.

It is so nice to see that even over 20 years later, still not much can beat The Lion King. The story is about Simba, a lion who's, and I know I don't give any spoilers when I say this, father, Mufasa, dies when Simba was young. He meets Timon and Pumba, and learns the saying Hakuna Matata, which means no worries. It is still so weird that this films story remains a masterpiece. Simba is a very likable character. Scar, in my opinion, is one of the most amazing villains in a Disney film EVER. And with villains like Ursula from Little Mermaid and Cruella De Vil from 101 Dalmatians, that's an accomplishment. Now I am going to say it, I don't like Timon and Pumba. You can hate me all you want, you can boo me. I personally don't find them funny. But for the rest of the movie- oh, you thought I forgot the songs? I LOVE these songs. Maybe if I had to choose my least favorite, it would be ""I just can't wait to be king"". I think it cheesy.

I immediately fell in love with Pumbaa (what little kid didn't?!) and the entire movie itself just moved me. This is definitely one of Disney's most classic movies. It is, however, extremely over-hyped. The beauty of this movie is astounding, and since so many people have fallen in love with it like I have it has become a movie Disney lovers either exalt or smite. There is no meat on the Lion King sandwich. You either love it or hate it. I, personally, love it. I used to love to sing with all the songs from The Lion King when I was young. Scar always has been and always will be on of my favorite Disney villains. He is cunning and cold in a downright sexy way! All in all.... this movie has everything. Emotion, dedication, romance, drama... I love the Lion King with all my heart!",
886,18 July 2002,cjmax21,10, Is this Disney at its best? Absolutely!!,"Oh my goodness! The Lion King is in my opinion the best Disney animated film ever. Although films such as Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin come close, The Lion King outdoes them all and in one word can be described as ""incredible"". Sometimes, I wonder why Disney can't make more movies like this one because there have been many good movies made in recent years, but none of them have all the elements like animation, music, etc. like The Lion King does. Every bit of this film from the grand beginning to the last was outstanding! First, the voices to match the characters were right on. Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg, Jeremy Irons, and Rowan Atkinson delivered and really brought life to the characters. Unlike most Disney films, The Lion King also brought humor to a new level with Timon and Pumbaa. Watching these two characters make me want to watch this movie over and over again and soak in every line to the point I can memorize it. The plot also was superb. There was never a dull moment in the film and during the film, I found myself in awe because I could relate to some of the characters so well. That is another reason why I found The Lion King thrilling is because it portrays a major theme of knowing who we are and living out our lives the way we feel that can benefit others. That is why I find this film so moving. Lastly, the score composed by Hans Zimmer left me in awe. All the songs really were great and helped the story flow so smoothly. So overall, I strongly recommend you either purchase The Lion King is you haven't already or just rent it because I almost guarantee there will be moments where you think, ""wow, this is Disney at its best",

If you look at it carefully and study the movie, it is basically telling how we live today. How we tend to lose ourselves and forget who we are. How we forget what we are meant to live for and why we are here in the first place. How we are all equal in this circle of life under one God. This movie has one main message, ""Finding your true self, and discovering where your meant to be"". It's truly an inspiring movie and the soundtrack to it is amazing. The Lion King, in my opinion is one of the best of all time. My birthday is in about a week and I was thinking of getting it on DVD.

The best Disney animated film ever...This film had it all, it was funny, emotional, had family drama, and above all, great animation and songs! Outstanding animated feature from Disney that sports outstanding songs by Elton John, a compelling story and first-class animation. Young lion cub Simba is to be king, but he leaves after he believes he was the reason for his father's death (of course this is not so).",

Movies based around animal characters can often leave you dissapointed, as the stories while often sad fail to create any sense of raw emotion or realness. However, with the Lion King there is something about the characters which makes you fall in love with them or hate them which is created through more than cute appearances and evil tricks or strained attempts at arousing sympathy.",

The combination of voice actors was perfect(especially James Earl Jones for Mufasa, Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella for Timon and Pumbaa and Jeremy Irons for Scar), the scenes were animated awesomely(especially the stampede scene in the gorge and during ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"", the music set just the right mood for each scene as well as having a truly African sound with all the chants, there was just the right blend of humor and seriousness, and the messages it conveys are strong yet subtle enough that they don't take away from the movie. Even the sequel is great, as much as a sequel can be.  I give it a ten!  If you haven't seen it, it is a must-see, and if you have seen it, see it again!  This is truly a film worth your time!",

The people creating the lion king should be very proud because it touches peoples hearts, makes them get goosebumps. The lion king were supposed to be a b-film and Pocahontas the a-film, man were they wrong. the lion king were a much more bigger success and it's not hard to understand why. the lion king is the best animated movie of all time, no doubt about it!",

It has many of the same ideas, about the father murdered by his brother, and the son seeking revenge. However, Nala doesn't go insane and die, Simba doesn't go insane, he just goes on a ""simbacation"" and some other things. The main reason that it seems very similar is because both stories are full of Archetypes, which if you don't know what that is, look it up. it's very interesting. It is a great movie and i really don't have a problem with the comparisons to Hamlet. In my AP English class we discussed that very comparison and then discussed why it's not quite the same.

I suggest this childhood movie to any child, even teenagers or adults. I believe that people need to enjoy and know what a good movie is all about. Also the fact that the movie wasn't only a single but instead a series kept the audience attention to keep wanting more. The book is so sad that it can bring tears to anybody's eyes. What I also like its the musical aspect, it really makes the movie look more lively and unique than any other cartoon being made now. The graphics of the movie wasn't horrific rather it was terrific.

The song ""morning report"" is on the special edition and I think it added so much to the movie. ""The circle of life"" brings the African theme into the movie with all the chanting. ""Can you feel the love tonight"" brought romance and it a sense of tranquility.

But as he matures into a young adult, destiny calls him and Simba must confront his past in order to save his home and become the Lion King of the Pride Lands. What makes this movie so great is the timeless story, stunning animation and music that cannot be put into simple words. It is full of humor, warmth, and teaches many vital life lessons, which makes it great for kids. Seriously, if you are among the very few who haven't seen The Lion King, I suggest you see it and buy a copy of it while it is out of the Disney Vault.

943,20 August 2007,liviu1606,10, the best,"This is the best animated film I have ever seen. Simba, the son of king Muphasa is a lion cub that knows that one day will be his turn to become a king. But he is too fidgety and always gets into trouble and his father has to save him every time. The other problem is his uncle Scar that does not quite agree with the situation with the kingdom and develops a plan to kill his brother and become a king. This forces Simba to run away from the pride lands. He finds new friends that teach him never to look back and live his life. But the memories and some old friends remind him that he has a responsibility for his lands. Then he comes back to settle the things between him and his uncle. This movie is a good example of true friendship, faith and love. Great story, great characters, great animation, soundtrack and a lot of smart jokes. Let's not forget the voice acting(Jeremy Irons - Scar, James Earl Jones - Muphasa)that couldn't be better. I recommend it to all of you children, parents, grandparents...

It has the making of a great movie with good music,a variety of characters, and a talented cast. Hats off for Disney in this film. It's about a lion who loses his father and thinks it his fault. Even though it is really the fault of his treacherous uncle Scar. He runs away and meets Timone and Pumbaa, your classic comic relief. He grows up with them until an old friend (Nala) shows up and demands he returns to be king. He falls in love with her and debates with himself if he should return to Pride Rock to take over as King or not. Eventually through a series of strange events he does (rafiki a crazy baboon has a lot to do with that). And returns home to battle Scar. Scar convinces the pack that Simba murdered his father. Then they battle. Just as Scar is about to kill Simba he reveals he is the true murderer of Mufasa (Simba's father). With new found strength Simba jumps up and tackles Scar and forces him to admit to his crime. Then Simba takes his rightful place as King of Pride Rock.",

But it's overrated, especially in comparison to other movies: shortly below The Lion King, is To Kill a Mockingbird, an American classic, while the movie is certainly not as good as the book, I can promise you, it is far more thoughtful, intelligent, and overall deep than The Lion King, that is just considering the story, but I don't think the animators broke any new ground. Contrary to popular belief this is most certainly not the greatest Disney movie, American Disney, kids Disney, yes... However, over in Japan, lies Studio Ghibli, I suppose comparable to Pixar, in its association w/ Disney. And they have made Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke,and be cautioned they are not children's films. And if you look online you'll find several people who can point out that several Disney movies are essentially just kid's versions of many classic and original Shakespeare plays.",

Beautifully made, voice actors are just perfect (in the Finnish version) and the most important thing: the story is good. It's about facing your past and taking your place in life. And this little thing that still is important: the music. Hans Zimmer is definitely my favorite composer, and in The Lion King I always remember why. The mere music makes me cry, and add the movie itself: I'm crying my eyes off. I'm stunned that average rating for this movie in IMDb is only 7,8 out of 10. This movie is worth so much more. I have liked this movie ever since I saw it when I was a kid, but the older I become, the more I love it. I don't know a single person who haven't loved this movie once they've seen it.

This movie brings me a lot of good memories, this movie showed me the importance of life, friendship, love and family. Life, for the scene of the King Mufasa's death with Simba watching it ( I think this is one of the most sad moments in the whole history of cinema ); Friendship, for the extraordinary way of see the things of Timon and Pumbaa, helping and leaning Simba on his bad days; Love, for the relationship of Simba and Nala through the years since they were puppies; and Family, for the scene of Queen Sarabi watching Simba after many time. I watched ""The Lion King"" at the age of 5, 13 years ago! 12 years ago I bought the video, and 5 years ago the DVD. No matter what people say, or if they laugh, 'cause even there are movies like ""Unfaithful"", ""La Vita e Bella"", ""Down with Love"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""Girl, Interrupted"", ""Brokeback Mountain"" or ""One Tru Thing"", this is my favorite movie ever. Oh! I almost forget it! If you are sad for something, just remember, life is great, and say Hakuna Matata!",

Besides the one sentence/one-star reviews that always bring a film down these days? Probably one of Disney's greatest animated films ever, easily surpassing the many before it and many after it. The story is dynamic and much more involving than alas ""Cinderella"", ""Beauty and the Best"", and plenty of others that I not need say. Many Disney films seem to me oh so similar in premise and characters, this one stand s out as a truly unique and very different tale. And with the voice talents of Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Whoopi Goldberg, Rowan Atkinson, plus many, many others, the characters seemed much more human to me than the repeated after repeated princess in distress who is best friends with nature as well.how dull!

My favorite characters are King Simba and Princess Nala. I love all the adventures they go on together. The movie takes a sad scary turn. But then soon picks up with some colorful singing and life lessons. Timon and Pumbaa are hilarious characters. Timon being the meerkat and Pumbaa being the warthog.

The graphics on this movie may not be the ""best"" for the year that we are in, but they are astounding for the year in which this movie was made. This movie is suitable for young children to watch as it is seemingly fun and cute. But at the same time, there are parts of this movie that make you rethink aspects of your life. As an adult I believe it is acceptable for me to say that this is also a movie that adults can enjoy even though it was originally made for a younger audience. The Lion King is a movie that I believe every movie lover should have within their collection.

1042,11 January 2014,harpers30062,10, Lion King- Great Movie!,"I watched this movie when I was 5 years old and I enjoyed it then and still now. Simba was my favorite. I wish that they would have another movie. The music in the movie was great! Everyone should have a chance to watch this movie. Doesn't matter if you or young or old. The movie is good for anyone. It will teach you a lesson. I would really like to see a remake or extended movie of the Lion King. The makers should work on that. It would be cool if I could have a voice-over part in the new movie, if they would do it. I look forward to being an actress and can't wait to have the roles start coming in. Please check out the movie. It's awesome!!!",

1044,24 January 2014,SosichJeremy,10, A very bias opinion,I generally would try to take an objective approach when writing a review but this time i wont even try. This is one of my favourite cartoons. It's great for children and adults alike. It is one of the great Disney musicals. Definitely one of the top ten kids cartoons ever made.,
1045,24 January 2014,nizerff,10, Nota 10!,"I think is the best movie that Disney has ever produced! Very well done and with a beautiful story! Have adapted the story (which I think they have been inspired by William Shakespeare's Hamlet) with mastery! My Congratulations to Disney! They managed to produce something artistic and totally believable! I fell in love not only for design visual quality but also the quality of the script and the characters (their actions and personalities were firm, strong and well structured). I really fell in love. It was the first movie I watched in the cinema (I was a child at the time). It's a beautiful film to look at and review multiple times! I find it hard someone does not like the movie, is actually very good and who is of my generation know that this film was part of our childhoods! ",
1046,3 February 2014,Anika_Luna93,10, One of the best.,"The Lion King is by far one of the best movies ever released. I remember watching it on VHS as a little girl, and loving every minute of it. Hakuna Matata is the perfect song to sing when you're in a bad mood. So many good memories tied in with this one. Timon and Pumbaa are my favorite characters, simply because they are drop dead hilarious and have made so many lives so much happier just because of a simple joke. The hyenas freak me out a little, but they're very interesting characters. Simba is the typical child, impulsive, wild and ready to do what they want because they want to see for themselves instead of taking their parents word for it.",
1047,21 February 2014,ccc3-929-165680,8, The Lion King,"Casey Cox English 1030 February 21, 2014 Project Two: Synopsis A young lad, destined to be the king, runs away after he was tricked into believing that he killed his father. The Lion King, released in 1994, was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff. The estimated budget for the film was around $45,000,000 (imdb.com). Starring the voices of Matthew Broderick as Simba the lion, Nathan Lane as Timon the meercat, and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa the warthog. The film received many nominations for awards, and it won an Oscar for the song ""Can you feel the love tonight"". It won Golden Globes for best soundtrack score, best original song for ""Can you feel the love tonight"", and best motion picture in the Comedy/Musical category. The plot revolves around a young lion named Simba who is next in line to become the king of the Pride Lands. His best friend is a young lioness named Nala and they are to be married when they are old enough. His father, Mufasa, is the current king and is happily married to Sarabi, the head lioness. Mufasa has a hornbill for an adviser named Zazu, and a younger brother named Scar. Scar is friends with the hyenas, and together they make an evil team. Scar is jealous because now Simba will become the king instead of Scar. He wants his revenge, so he comes up with a plan to get rid of Mufasa and Simba for good. The movies starts out with the wise baboon Rafiki showing off Simba to all of the animals in the Pride Lands. One day, Simba and Nala go to an elephant graveyard, despite being forbidden to go there. They are attacked by three of the hyenas; Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. They are about to kill the lion cubs when Mufasa, being warned by Zazu, shows up and saves them both. Simba is then reprimanded and he promises his father that he will become more obedient. A short while later Scar decides to get his revenge. He leads Simba down to the gorge and tells him to work on his wimpy roar. The three hyenas are at the top of the gorge and they cause a stampede of wildebeests into the gorge, putting Simba's life in danger. Zazu then warns Mufasa of Simba's whereabouts and Mufasa rushes to save him. Mufasa saves Simba, but is injured by the stampeding herd. When he tries to climb up the gorge, Scar digs his claws into Mufasa's paws and throws him back down killing him. Scar then blames Simba for Mufasa's death and tells the cub to ""run away, and never return"" (The Lion King, 1994). Simba runs away and is quickly found by Timon and Pumbaa, two good natured friends who want to help Simba with his problems. The three live together for many years and base their lives on the slogan ""Hakuna Matata"" which means ""No Worries"" (The Lion King, 1994). One day as the friends are out and about, a female lioness spots Pumbaa and tries to hunt and kill him. Simba, now a grown lion, attacks the lioness and the two struggle. Simba then recognizes her as Nala, his childhood friend. The two catch up and Nala tells him that Scar has ruined the Pride Lands, allowing the hyenas to rule with him and that Simba needs to come back and claim his place as king. However, Simba is still overcome with the guilt of believing that he killed his father and he refuses to go back. He is then reminded by Rafiki that his father lives within him and wants him to go back to his home and take his rightful place as king. Simba returns to his home to find it in ruins. It is dark and grey, there are hyenas everywhere and everyone seems sad and broken down. When Scar sees Simba, Scar's first thought is that Mufasa had risen from the dead since Simba looked so much like his father. Scar tries to humiliate Simba by telling all of the lions that Simba killed his father. Scar and Simba then start fighting and lightning strikes starting a fire. Scar almost overpowers Simba and he holds Simba off a cliff in the same manner that he held Mufasa off the cliff. Scar then leans over and whispers to Simba that it was actually he who killed Mufasa and it was not Simba's fault at all. Simba is filled with anger and he gains the strength to attack Scar. He throws his uncle over a small cliff, where the hyenas attack and kill Scar. It promptly starts raining putting out the fire, and Simba takes his place as king of the Pride Lands. A while later the Pride Lands have been restored to their previous natural beauty. Simba married Nala and the two have had a son. Rafiki then comes and shows off their son to the animals in the kingdom, just as he had done before with Simba.",

I've seen it at least ten time. This pictorial representation of the African savanna and exotic animals still attracts us so much. It is obvious that this anime is full of inventiveness, virtuosity, humor and draws emotion.It's about the weight to assume his legacy, not to disappoint his parents. but we can also see it as the irresponsibility of the chain and animal alimentary.The cub Simba, forceps undergo an accelerated learning life after the death of his father Mufasa. he must confront his duplicitous uncle, Scar, a of the vilest villains that we could see.the animation reached very high levels, including this impressive sequence where a troupon wild wildebeest rushes canyon.the soundtrack is a festival of tubes.

1051,5 September 2014,goldy-coa-ent,10, Lion King teaches lesson,"Great movie! It teaches kids to stop being so gullible and that life is a learned lesson. I feel like it is suitable for all age groups to watch. The characters all represent different qualities and characteristics. These qualities are strength, will power, happiness, love, passion and more. The movies starts off with Simba as a baby. He is on a mission to be the king, however he has to be groomed. His father is showing him the ropes and making sure he is ready for the kingdom. Simba has to go through a lot of different experiences through out the movie to shape him into the man he needs to be. Along this journey is looses his father and he is manipulated by Mustafa into thinking the death of his father was his fault. He had to then realize that it wasn't, in which that made him grow as a person to be strong for others. This movie was great in so many different way. I hope you watch it and enjoy it as much as I did.",
1052,1 October 2014,kinseylee3,10, This is a movie about a young lion struggling to find his place in the circle of life.,"When I was a little kid, every time I was asked what I wanted to be when I grew up, my answer was not a teacher, an astronaut, an athlete, or a doctor, like most children. My answer was a lion. The Lion King was my favorite movie as a child and held a great impact on me. I watched it all the time and soon knew every word to the catchy songs. I think the movie is phenomenal and turned out to be a very entertaining movie. It is still one of my favorite movies today. This Disney animated movie is unique because unlike many other Disney favorites that were made around the same time, The Lion King is one of the few that was not based on a previous story (Wilmes, ""The Lion King""), and in my opinion is the best Disney movie of all time. This movie provides the audience with many upbeat songs and essential life lessons. First, the film shows that everyone should own up to his or her responsibilities as adults, or there may be consequences. This is seen when Simba, who should go back to the Pride Lands, his former home, and take his place as king, refuses to go back. Meanwhile back at the Pride Lands, Scar, the present king and Simba's uncle, has destroyed the kingdom and made life miserable for Simba's family and all the other lions. Another good lesson that is learned is shown when Rafiki, a wise monkey, hits Simba on the head with his walking stick. Simba, disgruntled, asks what he did to deserve that and Rafiki answers him by saying that whatever the reason, it does not matter anymore. Simba, confused, agrees but explains that it still hurts. Rafiki provides his advice by saying ""Oh yes, the past can hurt. But from the way I see it, you can either run from it or learn from it"" (""The Lion King Quotes""). This quote from Rafiki was one of the main reasons that Simba eventually went back to the Pride Lands, even when he vowed to never return because he did not want to face his past. Simba thought Scar told everyone in the Pride Lands that Simba had killed his father and Scar's brother, Mufasa, the former king, when in actuality Scar was the one that killed him. A popular saying that has been gained from The Lion King is ""Hakuna Matata"". This is a phrase that Simba learns from his new best friends he meets after he runs away from home, Timon and Pumbaa. Hakuna Matata becomes the three's motto, which they comprehend as meaning ""no worries"". This phrase is known widely in the world, meaning that people should not worry about the small things in life and worry as less as possible. The Lion King not only tells a good message, but also is very entertaining as confirmed by an online critic ""this stylish, ambitious and magical film provides a delightfully entertaining experience for moviegoers of all ages"" (Wilmes, ""The Lion King""). The words in this quote 'stylish', 'ambitious', 'magical' and 'delightful' all perfectly describe The Lion King as a whole. The movie is very optimistic, leaving the audience with a good feeling at the ending. It is also not only for children. The songs may be childish, however they are still very catchy and many adults and teenagers still sing along to them while watching the movie. The Lion King is an ideal movie to watch for a family movie night or a night alone. There have been questions concerning whether this film is appropriate or not for children. For example, ""Scar arranges Mufasa's disturbing on-screen death in a manner that both banishes Simba to the wilderness and raises questions about whether this film really warranted a G rating"" (Maslin, ""The Lion King (1994)""), was stated in a review posted in The New York Times. However, the concept of the circle of life is mentioned many times throughout the film. Mufasa explains to Simba that even though they eat other animals, when they die, their bodies become the grass, and the other animals eat the grass. This concept lightens death in a way that is acceptable for children to hear and understand. I can also say that when I was a kid I was never too frightened by Mufasa's death or other scenes in the movie to watch it and have never heard of a child being scared of The Lion King. Also, if a child that is too young to comprehend death watches the movie, they would most likely only pay attention to the songs anyways and not completely understand the plot.",

Apart from being excellently animated with great sound effects, I appreciate the use of actual African Swahili words. They were well interpreted and used correctly. The story line is awesome especially where Simba has to make a difference and bring in the bad guys into the right fold. The use of colors and sound was well executed. I love the fact that its a movie that I can watch with my mature or grownup guys and not hide it from the young ones. It is very encouraging - morally speaking and has a strong moral teaching that provides direction on some stuff one can do when they are faced with challenges or when they need to find light in the midst of darkness. It is was well researched and I would definitely watch it again.",
1055,1 November 2014,krensk01,9, Excellent animation and storyline,"The Lion King is a film that teaches us about nature's circle of life, as a lion cub born in the Pride Lands of Africa, learns what responsibility means as he grows up. Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) is the cub of King Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Sarabi (Madge Sinclair) who is a typical curious youngster. His uncle, Scar (Jeremy Irons), is not happy with being replaced as future king and develops a plot to eliminate both Mufasa and Simba. In the meantime, Mufasa is teaching Simba about the circle of life and how we are all intertwined in it. This theme is seen in the Disney movie Pocahontas during the song, Color of the Wind, where Pocahontas (Judy Kuhn) sings to John Smith (Mel Gibson) how everything in nature is connected together. ",
1056,26 December 2014,sarah-louise-nichols15,10, the lion king,"The lion king is quite a good film because its my favourite Disney film and that my favourite character is Simba. The songs are quite good in the film, but that's my opinion. There is one fighting scene in it as the film goes on. Overall in my opinion it will probably be the best kids film you will have ever watched in your while life. Also there will be a bit of upsetting parts in the film like the death of Simbas dad when Scar pushes him off the edge of a cliff. But apart from that it will be a really good film to watch with younger family members that you will enjoy Also its the best film that has a song to it that i think is called Can You Feel The Love Tonight",
1057,6 December 2008,safari200,10, truly a masterpiece,"The lion king has always been one of my favorite animated films and after watching it again after more than a decade, I believe it always will be. A wonderful story about a young lion cub racked with guilt over his father's death, who runs away to escape the torment but ultimately overcomes it and resumes his place in the Great Circle Of Life. It is the struggles of Simba that make this a great movie, such as the love he has for his father, the sadness he feels from his death and the need to escape painful memories, the ultimate realization that you can't hide away forever, that life moves on and you must move with it and do what you know is right. Deep moral lessons are something lacking in today's films, especially those intended for children, and that is why TLK has had a lasting impression on movie viewers. This coupled with an amazing soundtrack and beautiful visual design makes The Lion King a timeless classic, and one I'd recommend to anyone, including adults. Definitely worth watching.",

In my mind, this is the last classic hand drawn film, and it upsets me that I have to wait for another five years for it to come out on DVD. This film deals with great issues and involves a huge conflict for the main character, something that recent kid/family films lack. It is funny and lighthearted when it should be, and heartfelt and serious when it needs it. I believe that everybody should see this movie, regardless of your age.It may just be the last good movie that Disney will ever do without the help of Pixar.",

1074,4 May 2018,alyssaj-31058,9, The Lion King (Spoiler),"The movie I chose to watch was, ""The Lion King."" After watching this movie, I was able to analyze the world views and themes of this contemporary movie. In this movie, the main character or hero was a lion named Simba. Near the end of the movie, Simbas's main goal is to get rid of his uncle, Scar, who is controlling his land and take back what belongs to him as king. The main adversary he had was Scar because he was controlling his family and territory and Simba had to learn to be strong and fight for what belongs to him. Simba's character flaw at first would be that he is afraid to move on from his past and step up as a leader. Simba's apparent defeat would be when he feels hopeless and lost because he is scared and confused about what to do about becoming king. When Nala comes to seek him for help, he is at first afraid and doubts himself because he is afraid that he will not have the strength to defeat Scar. The final confrontation would be between Simba and Scar when they are fighting on a cliff. At first Simba tells him to leave and never come back but Scar instead tries to kill Simba which results in them fighting. In the end, Simba wins and the he realizes how even though he was afraid of not being as great of a leader as his father was, he was just as great or even better because he reclaimed and restored his rightful territory. The result of his change would be that he finally regained his family and place as rightful king. Overall, I think the main theme would be that although the past can hurt(like when Simba's dad died), and no matter what you have done, we cannot run away from our problems, but rather confront them and choose to persevere. 
One part of the movie that shows evidence for the movie's moral or message was when Rafiki hit Simba in the head with his staff and told him that ""sometimes the past can hurt."" Rafiki taught him that although the past can hurt we have to persevere and move on to become who we were meant to be. I agree with this theme because many of us are going through hard times but it does not mean that we should give up or run away from our responsibilities. I think the only thing I would have done differently was go back sooner to help my family because I would feel responsible for them and my territory. I think that this movie coincides with biblical truth because Simba's father comes back in the form of clouds(like God might), to tell Simba that he lives inside Simba(like the Holy Spirit). He tells Simba that he has forgotten him and who Simba really is, just like some of us forget to remember God, our father. The only part that I thought might stray away from biblical truth would be when his father tells him that Simba needs to look inside himself, which as Christians we should look to God not ours,even for strength. By saying this I think they are trying to portray the worldview of Individualism, and how we do not need anyone to help us but maybe a reminder. I think that this movie ultimately condemns evil because in then end Simba defeats his uncle, Scar and takes back what truly belonged to him. I think the main world views in the movie are Post-Modernism and Christianity. I think that they arr portraying the world view of Post-Modernism in it a little because they have the characters of Timon and Pumbaa telling Simba, that ""when the world turns its back on you, you turn your back on the world."" They also teach him the famous ""Hakuna Matata"" song which talks about having no worries in life and living how you want. I think that the movie also portrays some aspects of Christianity because when Simba is talking to his dad in the clouds, he tells Simba that he must take his place in the circle of life and remember who he is, because Simba is his son and ""the one true king."" In my opinion, this portrays the world view of Christianity because he is basically telling Simba that he needs to remember his purpose in life and remember that he is the one true king, which sounds like Jesus who is the one true king, which we are told about in the Bible. I think that a positive element would be that the movie portrays some positive themes like how we should persevere through all the hurts and roadblocks in our lives. I think a negative element would be that they include the part of Hakuna Matata, and saying how it is okay to live a life care free, and only worrying about oneself. I think that I would recommend this movie to most people and kids because it has a positive message and is rated PG which is appropriate for most ages.",
