0,15 March 2008,preppy-3,10, A true Hollywood horror story,"Hack screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) accidentally falls in with faded screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She lives in a crumbling old mansion with her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim). She refuses to believe that she's no longer remembered and will never make another movie. She gets Gillis to stay with her and rewrite ""Salome"" which she thinks will be her comeback. Gillis has no other choice and things slowly get out of hand.",/
1,11 April 2004,FilmOtaku,9, Another Billy Wilder masterpiece,"I have yet to see a Billy Wilder film that I haven't loved, and Sunset Boulevard is definitely one of those films.  It's interesting to watch the film during different times in one's life  when I was a child watching this film, I thought the story was good and that Norma Desmond (Swanson) was a pretty scary lady.  In my teens/college years, I appreciated it as a certified classic and for its commentary on Hollywood.  Now, in my late 20's and early 30's I found it to have a different impact on me  I was saddened by Desmond's mental illness, and when she makes her final descent down her staircase and utters her famous line as the camera pans the faces of the people around her, so full of pity, and the care her butler/ex-husband takes to make sure she's happy for maybe the last time in her life made more of an impact on me than any other time in the 20-odd times I've seen this film. There are only a small handful of central characters in Sunset Boulevard and they are so richly written that this film will remain timeless.  There are not a lot of `dated' themes in this film  the circle of life that is Hollywood isn't going to be much more evolved in 2050 than it was in 1950. If you haven't seen this film, watch it because there is something for just about anyone in this film.",r
2,22 April 1999,Don-102,10, The Hollywood Myth FOREVER Shattered !!!,"Until 1950, American films were strictly entertainment, some deeper than others. Studio executives were very protective of image and star-making. In essence, everything seemed perfect. Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett, and D.M. Marshman, Jr. created a stunning work of art that splits the Hollywood sign in two and exposed a dream factory for what it really is: a struggle to both gain and keep notoriety in the limelight. ""Norma Desmond"" and ""Joe Gillis"" are at opposite ends of this warped Hollywood mindset, with Gillis, played by that most cynical of actors, William Holden trying to pay the rent and Norma (Gloria Swanson) living a lie as a silent queen whose star burned ""10,000 midnights ago"". How a picture with such a snide look at the industry could come out in 1950 is simply mind-boggling, considering some of the light fodder that came out of Hollywood at the time. It has inspired many modern day disciples such as Altman's THE PLAYER, and Sonnenfeld's GET SHORTY, both of which took their vicious, hilarious parodies to the jugular of the movie capital of the world. SUNSET BLVD is the father of all socially oriented pictures regarding the movies and is by far the best.",e

Suppose it was a woman writer trying to break into Hollywood, completely broke who, due to a flat tire, wanders into that big mansion. Pretty much financially cornered, she agrees to a job reworking some old film star's (let's say John Gilbert lived) script and comeback vehicle and slowly, what independence she has is taken away - her things are moved from her apartment where she is behind on her rent into a room over the garage at the mansion, her host sits by and lets her car be repossessed, she is never paid the promised cash for her work, a bad rainstorm moves her from her room over the garage into a room in the main house where there are no locks on the doors and thus no privacy, and then the seduction. Who would be the cad then?",v

6,15 April 2007,Nazi_Fighter_David,9, A film packed with unforgettable moments,"Although at that time she hadn't appeared in a film for several years and wasn't to make one for several for several more, Gloria Swanson remained a presence in the Hollywood of the thirties, the only legendary silent star to sustain an image and continue to interest the film studios, which put her under contract and announced her to star in a series of projectsnone of which were realized While she wasn't to regain her former eminence until her celebrated comeback as Norma Desmond in Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard,"" a scathing satire on Hollywood and the self-delusions of its former heroes, she maintained her silent-screen image as the personification of glamor, and as such wasn't the initial choice for the role of the faded silent star ",w
7,26 March 2001,rupie,8," weird, bizarre, fascinating, great","This movie deserves all the accolades it has gotten here, as well as ""Maltin's"" four stars. It certainly ranks up there as one of Hollywood's greatest achievements. Seeing it again only reinforces my opinion that William Holden was one of the truly great actors of the last [!] century. Gloria Swanson, however, steals every scene she's in; you can't turn away from watching her, even though she makes you really uncomfortable - it's like watching a train wreck. I don't know if the black & white was an economic or an artistic choice, but the film would never have been as effective in color. The opening shot - the floating, dead body of Joe Gillis, eyes wide open, shot looking up from the bottom of the pool - is one of the great shots, and an unforgettable opener, matched perfectly by the unforgettable closing closeup of Norma Desmond. To have Cecil B. deMille actually play himself was an inspired touch. Throw in Eric von Stroheim and you have an unbeatable combination. Truly one the all-time must-see films, although I don't know how to classify it - film noir? black comedy? Hollywood fable ? horror story? psychodrama? Who cares; just see it.",/
8,2 February 2015,seymourblack-1,9, Living In The Past,"The advent of the talkies created possibly the biggest-ever upheaval in the history of Hollywood and the impact it had on the careers of a large number of the industry's popular stars at that time was enormous. Many whose voices seemed unacceptable because they were incompatible with their image or because of a heavy foreign accent, found themselves out of work as did others who were simply unable to adapt to the demands of the new era. Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard"" provides a fascinating insight into some of the more ruthless and unpleasant facets of the Hollywood system in a style that's witty, cynical and realistic and also features a number of actors whose careers were profoundly affected by the arrival of the talkies.",r
9,18 January 2008,claudio_carvalho,10, A Bitter and Tragic Masterpiece,"In Hollywood of the 50's, the obscure screenplay writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) is not able to sell his work to the studios, is full of debts and is thinking in returning to his hometown to work in an office. While trying to escape from his creditors, he has a flat tire and parks his car in a decadent mansion in Sunset Boulevard. He meets the owner and former silent-movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who lives alone wit her butler and driver Max von Mayerling (Erich von Stroheim). Norma is demented and believes she will return to the cinema industry, and is protected and isolated from the world by Max, who was his director and husband in the past and still loves her. Norma proposes Joe to move to the mansion and help her in writing a screenplay for her comeback to the cinema, and the small-time writer becomes her lover and gigolo. When Joe falls in love for the young aspirant writer Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), Norma becomes jealous and completely insane and her madness leads to a tragic end.",w
10,6 September 2013,ironhorse_iv,9," Alright Sunset BLVD, are you ready for your close up?","The movie is still big. It's the pictures that got small. There is nothing like watching Sunset Boulevard. It's a great movie that need to be in the center of attention. Name after a Boulevard in Los Angeles, this film noir was directed and co-written by Billy Wilder who destroy forever the iconic Hollywood image with his dark tale of greed, and the lust of everlasting fame. The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, an unsuccessful screenwriter who happen to come upon, a faded silent movie starlet, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who draws him into her fantasy world where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. William Holden is great in the role as a man struggling to keep his masculinity. I like his moral decision in the end of the film. Serve them right. In a way, this movie was indeed William Holden comeback film as well as he fallen from the starlight after 1939's Golden Boys. Gloria Swanson is scary, charming and brilliant in the Femme fatale manipulative role. She does over act a bit, but that comes with the part. She's pretty much playing an extreme version of herself. Gloria, herself was trying to have a comeback with this film, after a number of fails films, include one with Director Erich von Stroheim in 1929's Queen Kelly. Art is mirroring real life, as Erich von Stroheim stars as Max Von Mayerling, her butler and the director that discovered her. There is even a chilling theater scene with all the main characters watching the film, Queen Kelly. Erich von Stroheim is just amazing in this film, and I have become a fan of his works. I didn't like Nancy Olson so much as Betty Schaefer as I felt she was way too chirpy for my taste and in your face shouting acting. I do like the silent film stars cameos like Director Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson. I do like the cameo of the set of 1949's DeMille's Samson and Delilah. It makes the film seems more real to Hollywood, to know that another real life film was really taking place there. While, the characters could had been nearly unlikeable, Billy Wilder's comedy charm gives this movie some room to breathe. I have to praise the writing. It's amazing. Yes, some of the jokes went over my head, but the film was balance well enough for the drama and the comedy, not to feel overloaded. The narrative of film noirs are usually characterized as multifaceted and often confusing. It does commonly entailing the use of flashback and first-person voice-over narration. I'm pretty glad they open the film with the shot of the swimming pool, rather than having two corpses talking to each other at the morgue. I think it does sound stupid so I'm glad they use the dead body in the swimming pool idea. The corpse floating in the pool in the film's opening scene. The desired image proved difficult to achieve, and the problem was resolved by placing mirrors on the bottom of the swimming pool and filming from above. The underwater shot was pretty impressed at the time. The visual effects are amazing. Sunset Boulevard uses a lot of high-contrast lighting in Norma's house that creates dark shadows that works well. The lighting and the setting is to show the character is suffocating in their life. Norma is ever looking for the light. I love the foggy blur that it create when people get near it. It's symbolism at its best. The film also contains some German-expressionistic element such as the oblique vertical and horizontal angles. For some interior shots, the crew sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest dirty or unclean. The house was old, and nice. The way the photographs were surrounding. It look like some odd Gothic church. The house was later used by Nicholas Ray's 1955's Rebel Without a Cause. It was pretty interesting. The score was composed by Franz Waxman was pretty good. Nothing worth noting compare to today's standards. It was just OK, at best for me. Here are some faults in the film in my opinion. The narrating goes a little bit too long. Show, don't tell. Plus, how do dead-men can do a narration anyways? Aren't they dead? The whole blooming Gillis-Betty relationship seem out of place as well. I know it's needed for the plot, but it's seem forced. I just don't see Betty having much interested in a man, she barely sees. The story was a bit influence by the real life tragedy of Mabel Normand and William Desmond Taylor, in which William Desmond got shot and killed. This film marks the first time that Hollywood was view in a negative light on film. The theme of this movie is that Hollywood creates dreams and stars, and then leaves them with nothing but their own outdated fantasies. In the other side of the coin, some people are so hungry for the fame, that they are willing to do anything for a shot at it, even destroying lives. Hollywood still love and hate the film for its criticism of the movie industry. It's still a bit controversial, ever today. Wilder show us the real Hollywood where few people had success and many fails. People mustn't starve for fame too long, else they risk being trapped in a world of their own making, a world where they become bitter and delude.",9

It is so beautifully shot (in that stark black/white that only nitrate negative could achieve), has a witty, clever and extremely well-written script, features some of the best acting in film's history, acrobatically balances the main plot/subplots with expert precision, contains some of the best characters on celluloid, has many true-to-life parallels (Swanson's career/real life cameos/DeMille's involvement/etc) and is peppered with such great dialogue/narration that today's film writers should take note.

20,25 August 2005,Quinoa1984,10," arguably Wilder at his very best; Swanson, Holden, and von Stroheim are about perfect","I was a little speechless after I first finished watching Sunset Blvd. I had an idea of what to expect, but I didn't expect that a film made over half a century ago would be so sharp, so artistically compelling, and so tragic while still containing a blistering sense of humor. In some ways it was ahead of its time with its satire, ironically in a film that looks to the past with a sense of sad, but honest nostalgia. Gloria Swanson, the star of the film, plays a woman who is a star still in her old mind, Norma Desmond. There are a handful (how big the hand is depends on the particular viewer) of films where you have a character or characters that are not only unforgettable, but become so trenched in the public consciousness its hard to think of mistaking it for anything else. Even as a kid and knew that line ""I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille"" was a basic, but dead-on swipe at ego, or at least stardom. That it was in this context makes it all the more comic/tragic. That Sunset Boulevard also has the distinction of being in the film-noir tradition along with having some satirical grounding solidifies it one of the really unique films of the Golden Age of post World War 2 America.",e

It is the pictures that got small"".

25,30 October 2001,telegonus,8, Hollywood & Sunset,"Widely heralded as a classic upon its initial release, the Billy Wilder-Charles Brackett production, Sunset Boulevard, is a superb piece of work in nearly all departments; and yet at some levels it disappoints upon repeated viewings. This is not an easy movie to love. The people in it are unsympathetic, as the leading male character is a hack screenwriter turned gigolo; and the woman he lives with is a mad former silent movie star who pins all her hopes on this third-rate writer's ability to write her 'comeback' picture. Neither is an amiable sort, but he is at least sane; and though he has an understanding of decency, he never quite achieves it. His goal is success. That he decieves two women who care for him deeply bothers him from time to time, when it is an inconvenience, but doesn't otherwise seem to bedevil him or prey on his thoughts. ",t

He can't get off the mark and leave, though he has numerous chances to do so. Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond gives the performance of the century. She is vulnerable and evil; she has the power from her wealth to keep Holden in check. Most people who portray these kinds of characters are hard to believe. She is a bundle of eccentricity and believability. And, like a little boy, he can't leave his mother. We get glimpses of his other life which seems glamorous and exciting, but he cannot give up that financial support and sells himself out; unfortunately to the nth degree. Billy Wilder is a skillful director and what he does with the black and white images (this film has to be in black and white) with the Norma Desmond poses and dreariness of her existence, just works so well.

This story of a down on his luck Hollywood screenwriter and his peril fraught associations with a fading silent film star plotting her return to the big screen has all the things a noir fan loves; dark mysterious places, a near constant sense of looming danger, rapid and smart dialog and great narration by William Holden. But the film is about more than that. It is about the rough and perilous life that goes with any work in a business as tumultuous as Hollywood, and the unpredictable nature of celebrity.

Here, Swanson plays a silent film diva Norma Desmond leading a secluded life in her mansion, almost a metaphor of a princess in a tower.

48,21 August 2006,Jonny_Numb,6," A somewhat savage, somewhat sick peek behind the Hollywood curtain","""Sunset Boulevard,"" Billy Wilder's barbed take on the Hollywood studio system during its heyday is by turns volatile, funny, suspenseful, and--at its core--more than a little creepy. By today's standards, this 1950 film still takes some relevant shots at an industry that seldom acknowledges its superficiality, but is also just as dated in other regards. Wilder takes a truly original concept, bending Film Noir, satire, comedy, and pathos in the telling of Joe Gillis (William Holden), a down-on-his-luck screenwriter (the repo men are threatening to take his car, for Pete's sake!), who winds up all but imprisoned in the lonely, secluded mansion of Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a washed-up silent-film starlet harboring delusions of a comeback. When drafted to revise Desmond's self-scripted version of ""Salome,"" Joe becomes very aware of his unhinged provider, and quickly begins a collaboration with the young, rhinoplasty-friendly Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson). While Holden and Olson are--in the midst of this send-up--fresh-faced stars, ""Sunset Boulevard""'s axis of madness hinges squarely on Swanson's full-bore performance, a blend of incestuous sexuality and mid-life crisis (she makes Baby Jane seem warm and cuddly by comparison) that makes her advances on Holden genuinely unappealing. The performance is a bit more tricky than one might give credit--as a woman whose fame has declined, her sustained hunger for it fuels her delusion, therefore rendering Norma Desmond an actress who literally acts out her everyday reality, to the point where any semblance of humanity is absent (her actions and words possess the overt dramatics of a woman seeking the Best Actress Oscar). While the film is beautifully photographed and performed, the sheer ambition of the project is something of a flaw--with so many genres represented, ""Sunset Boulevard"" is problematic in synthesizing a coherent vision. But what is here is quite influential, and certainly worth a look.",

Great to see Hollywood circa 1950, with Schwab's Drug Store still there, but it's sad to think that even in 1950, stars were being discarded, replaced by the new and the younger, and even a star like Norma Desmond couldn't get a picture made.

52,19 August 2013,inkblot11,9, Are you ready for your close-up review of Sunset Boulevard?,"Joe Gillis (William Holden) moved to Hollywood from Ohio in hopes of becoming a successful screenwriter. But, alas, although he can produce a script in a very short period of time, he has no luck in selling any of them to the studios. He's borrowed money from everyone he knows and, now, his car is on the point of being re-possessed. In fact, on one critical day, the repo men are waiting for him and only a bit of quick thinking on Joe's part delays the inevitable. Joe's tire blows and he makes a sharp right turn into the driveway of an enormous mansion. Seeing that the garage door is open and near empty, he sneaks his car into the building. Before long, a servant named Max comes out to greet him and invites him in, thinking Joe is there to see the lady of the house. SHE is silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who is very wealthy and reclusive. She also may be slightly touched in the head, for as she shows Joe around the place, she asks him to arrange a funeral for her monkey! Needless to say, the mansion is filled with photographs and other objects from her glory days. As the conversation continues, she discovers he is a screenwriter and she immediately asked him to help her with a script for her big comeback. That would be the role of Salome, where she will dance and end up with the head of John the Baptist. Having really nowhere to go and no money, Joe agrees. He is given rooms over the garage. However, Norma wants more. She falls for Joe and the younger writer becomes sort of a ""kept man"". This is degrading and humiliating for Joe but he likes the caviar and new clothe, after all. But, with there being little chance that Norma will ever make another film, how does Joe go on in this arrangement? Here goes, folks, are you ready for your close-up review of Sunset Boulevard?This classic film by master storyteller Billy Wilder is a must-see. First, the two main stars, Holden and Swanson, are near perfect in their roles, with all of the supporting cast darn wonderful, too. Watch for cameos from Buster Keaton, Cecil B. DeMille, and others. Then, the story starts at the end and back-ups, an intriguing arrangement.

What I think really holds this picture together is the well-down over-the-top portrayal of silent film star Norma Desmond by Gloria Swanson.  William Holden also does a good job of standing his own as well in a quiet but effective performance.  Basically, this is a story  about a failing screenwriter's accidental encounter with Norma Desmond who still lives in the past with the household staff playing along at every beat. He then becomes entangled in her web and has to fight himself out of her grip, but struggles with this because he is being taken care of financially and socially. But once Norma gets jealous of Holden's encounter with another woman the inevitable happens(which I will not give away).

William Holden is perfectly cast as the definitive writer-turned-gigolo (the role was originally meant for Montgomery Clift) and Erich Von Stroheim gives yet another star turn as her manservant, Max. There simply are not enough superlatives in the English language to convey the power and dark poetry of this quintessential cinematic classic. Franz Waxman provides one of his greatest scores here.

68,27 October 2014,avik-basu1889,9," It's the face, not the words !!!!!","This is the third Billy Wilder film I have watched after Ace in the Hole and The Apartment. After watching these 3 films, it is quite clear to me that unlike most films of that era, Billy Wilder's films used to have substantial and thought provoking messages underneath the basic plot and Wilder loved to visually voice his opinions about the different strata of contemporary society. Ace in the Hole was an uncompromising and dark study of the media and its effects on society ,while the The Apartment was a comedy with subtle commentaries on corporate/office culture. Sunset Blvd. is a film which shows the dark side of the film industry. How cutthroat this profession can be and how quickly actors and directors can become obsolete if they fail to adjust to the dynamic nature of the business. The film revolves largely around Joe Gillis,a struggling screenplay writer and Norma Desmond, an arrogant and scarily delusional former Hollywood star of the silent era. Norma finds it difficult to accept the fact that her days of stardom are behind her and the film industry and film directors no longer care for the actors from the silent era. In order to hide from the current film industry which she considers demeaning and abominable, she has completely isolated herself from the world and deliberately caged herself in her lavish and extravagant mansion where she still is a celebrity. When she meets Gillis the screenplay writer, she thinks that he can help her finish a script which she has written on her own for a film which will be her grand comeback. Gillis looks at this as an opportunity to get money out of Norma and get some respite from his financial problems. But slowly he finds himself trapped in this mansion with no freedom (which is a metaphor for the film world and how it allures and then traps people with dreams of making it big). This fatal partnership in the end leads to devastating and diabolical conclusions for everyone involved. While watching the film, I became certain that the character of Norma Desmond must have inspired and influenced Satyajit Ray to create the character of Huzur Biswambhar Roy for his film Jalsaghar(The Music Room). Like Norma, Biswambhar who was once a respected zamindar was also arrogant and separated himself from the world, a world where aristocracy was slowly fading and giving way to modernism. But while Jalsaghar was a poetic and musical masterpiece which oozes empathy and the essence of humanism, Sunset Boulevard had a dark,neo-noirish feel about it. Billy Wilder uses a lot of metaphors and symbolism. The dream about the monkey dancing for pennies, the drawing of the curtains, the rats in the pool, the limelight falling on Norma for a few moments before being taken away,etc. all these metaphors will be very meaningful to the discerning viewers. The acting is marvelous. Gloria Swanson is fantastic with her over the top and extremely dramatic representation of Norma Desmond and William Holden's realistic acting provides a good contrast to the larger than life Norma Desmond. But the only thing that didn't work for me was the melodrama in some scenes. There were a few moments which felt too unrealistic and melodramatic,especially the scenes involving Betty Schaefer. But overall this is a chilling commentary on the film industry, the miserable plight of old, forgotten actors and the glitz and glamour of the movie world which can lead to delusions. The film ends with catastrophic consequences. But the final scene has to go down as one of the greatest scenes in all of film history. That final scene is poetic, profound and yet filled with immense horror.",

First of all,there 's the Swanson/Von Stroheim couple.He directed her in the famous ""Queen Kelly""(another must of the silent movies).Von Stroheim was too ahead of his time,his movies scared the censors ,so he was not allowed to pursue a career that would have been stunning in the talkies.Here he became (supreme downfall),Swanson's butler ,while we see one of his former colleagues,Cecil B.

Swanson is impressive too.The comeback myth is the dream of every actor whose star is slowly but inexorably fading.that she continues viewing her old -and real!- triumphs like ""Queen Kelly,that she's writing an extravaganza shows that her comeback desire has reached the point of no return and that her only place in this world is the asylum.What Swanson did not achieve in the movie,she did it for real:she really could come back(as Lilian Gish),her performance,particularly in the last scene ,has stood the test of time.

74,8 September 2021,nickenchuggets,10," ""I am big. It's the pictures that got small""","Something that makes Sunset Boulevard a very unique movie even to this day is how it manages to intertwine real life film history into its storyline. Not many movies utilize this, but it's fantastic when used correctly. It allows the audience to relate to the film more, because some locations and characters in it are actually real. Maybe that's what makes this movie so good, but there are of course many reasons why. The movie begins with a commonly used trope that I personally have mixed feelings about, meaning they start by showing a scene that will appear much later in the movie. As of right now, you don't understand why people are trying to retrieve someone's dead body from a swimming pool, but you'll find out in 2 hours. The body belongs to a man named Joe Gillis (William Holden), a screenwriter, who, 6 months before, drove away from men looking to steal his car. He parks it in the driveway of a large mansion which appears to be abandoned. After going inside, he finds out it is not deserted. A butler named Max (Erich Von Stroheim) mistakes him for a mortician that his employer has been expecting and urges him to go upstairs. Upon doing so, Joe comes face to face with Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), an aging former silent movie star who is looking to bury her dead chimpanzee. At first glance, Norma seems rude and unapproachable. She remains convinced of her superiority to other people, despite the silent era being long gone. Norma gets Joe to read a script she has created, and despite finding it terrible, Joe uses this opportunity as a pretense to move in with her. After living with her for a while, Joe is told by Max that Norma is insecure of her fading popularity and has previously tried to kill herself. Later, Joe goes to see his friend Artie and his girlfriend Betty, who reviewed a (bad) script Joe wrote earlier in the movie. After calling Max to let him know he is about to move out, Max bluntly tells Joe Norma attempted suicide again by slicing her wrists. Joe rushes to her mansion in a panic, but Norma only defiantly tells him it was a stupid thing to fall in love with him. Once Norma's injuries heal, she is driven to Paramount Studios to give her former director and friend, Cecil B DeMille, her finalized script. She receives a predictably warm welcome from everyone considering she is a film legend. What she doesn't know is that DeMille actually doesn't like the script and he only wanted her on set to use her rare Isotta Fraschini car as a prop. Meanwhile, Norma, taking DeMille's lies about her making a big onscreen comeback to heart, starts to doll herself up. Joe eventually learns from Max that he was the one who made her who she is, and was also her first husband. Norma, still harboring bad feelings for Joe, takes it upon herself to call Betty, whom Joe has been visiting lately at her office. However, the call gets interrupted by Joe when he walks in on Norma and overhears the whole conversation. Finally, Joe comes to the conclusion that he has had enough of Norma. He prepares to leave, but before doing so, cruelly tells Norma how she is washed up with no chance of revitalizing her career. Not only that, but it turns out Max writes all the fanmail she has sent to her. Joe ignores Norma's pleas and walks out the mansion and toward the swimming pool, at which point Norma fires the pistol she bought to commit suicide with at him. At long last, the flashback is complete, and the movie jumps back to the present, with Joe's corpse laying pitifully in the water. Norma's mansion is full of cops and newspapermen, and she's completely lost her mind. Still holding on to her belief she is still beautiful, famous and rich, she walks slowly down the stairs and tells the police cameras she is ready for her close-up. To her, everything is a movie, no matter how tragic. There's no doubt in my mind that Sunset Boulevard is one of the best movies of all time, but I'm stating the obvious here. It won 3 oscars, including the one for best screenplay. Gloria Swanson was nominated for best actress, but miraculously didn't win. Even though she was nothing like Norma Desmond in real life, it is true that she was a silent film star herself. As a matter of fact, the silent film Norma plays for Joe in the movie is one that Gloria appears in. It shouldn't be surprising that the acting in this movie is all great. William Holden plays the gullible scriptwriter perfectly, although I'll always remember him for Stalag 17. He comes to his senses at the end and decides to leave Norma, but she finalizes his decision for him. Gloria Swanson as Norma is the primary antagonist I would say, and you can sense something bad will happen to Joe as soon as he met her. She's obsessed with power and even tells people Paramount would not exist without her great efforts. As shown towards the end, she would rather be a murderer than be forgotten. Von Stroheim is a minor character, but still has an important role as Norma's loyal servant Max. You can argue he is too loyal to her because he writes all of her fanmail just to shut her up. For me, Sunset Boulevard is one of few movies where the backstory is actually just as interesting as the film itself. It's worth noting Billy Wilder tried very hard to pick the right woman for Norma's role, which was definitely no easy task. Possible candidates included Norma Shearer, Greta Garbo, Pola Negri, Mary Pickford, Clara Bow, and even Mae West, who was enraged at the thought of herself playing a washed up old fool. As you know, the part went to Gloria, and it's hard to imagine anyone but her playing it. The bottom line is Sunset Boulevard still remains an incredible movie 70 years later, and Wilder once again shows how it's done when it comes to noirs.",

It features excellent performances and is paced well, building up the tension as we see the madness of the strange Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) unfold. Swanson's performance at first seems very silly and over the top, until you realize that due to her silent film career, her speech patterns have become as broad as the expressions she used to convey emotions in her films. She's become this kind of otherworldly figure that doesn't fit in with normal people at all. I guess you could argue that she's the villain of the film and appropriately steals the show, but I also really like the more... sympathetic characters. William Holden and Nancy Olson have great chemistry and it's refreshing to see them on the screen together while the rest of the movie keeps showing off this weird relationship that develops between Holden and Swanson. If you don't know what the film is about, at first you may find it a little slow. As the story develops you will get sucked in and you won't even mind the fact that the story is told in flashback because you will either forget all about it or really want to know how the story you're seeing ends up the way it does.

78,30 August 2006,fimimix,10, ..Masterful glimpse of early Hollywood..,"I am 82-years-old. I have lived through the entire ""movie"" experience. I am always amused at ""reviews"" by people who weren't alive when the films were released. They can't imagine how many millions of hopeless people discovered, for a few pennies, the magical medium to help lift them from the drudgery of life. Nor are they aware that the earliest films were photographed in pure light. However, not only were the viewers entranced with pictures that ""moved"", those who were pioneering all this magic were also fascinated that their industry was growing so quickly and ingeniously. The ""silent"" period didn't last too long. Once it was discovered voices could be recorded as the actors-actresses played their roles, the technologies were developed very quickly. ""Sunset Boulevard"" is a graphic display of how big stars fell by the wayside, because they didn't have good voices. HOWEVER, there is no mention in this movie if Norma Desmond had been tested for speaking roles. By Gloria Swanson's performance, I would say Norma would have remained a great star, because the addition of a ""voice"" would have become a tremendous asset.

The great Billy Wilder as the director, William Holden, Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim as the principal actors, get their point across so brilliantly in a movie about movie making that it hurts. One of the reasons why it works so well is that ""Sunset Blvd."" is fiction placed in the real Hollywood, where references are explicitly sought, not hidden: Star director Cecil B. DeMille plays himself, ""movie zombies"" of times past like Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson have roles equivalent to their importance as movie stars at the time the film was shot, even former celebrated actor/director Erich von Stroheim pretty much plays himself. This lends the film authenticity and weight, sometimes a comedic or an unabashedly cynical touch, but more often revealing shockingly tragic insights in an all too common parallel universe celebrities use to live in - insights that have not lost any relevance to this day: Once caught in a dream world it's difficult to see through the haze of glory and notice that impending doom is just a step away...",

Gloria Swanson initially struck me as way over the top and wild-eyed at first, but given the whole nature of the proceedings, it's kind of understandable. William Holden is perfect as the desperate house guest, and Nancy Olson is the ideal girl-next-door. Eric von Stroheim is striking as Swanson's butler.

William Holden played the Joe Gillis role. Erich Von Stroheim played butler, Max and sweet Nancy Olson played Betty Schaefer. The story begins with Joe's death and he narrates his story about six months before his death about when things were collapsing around him financially. He was desperate just like Norma Desmond.

Every movie Wilder wrote and directed was on the Great side of Good but seeing all the titles in print in a brochure reinforces just how many GREAT movies he made. Somehow he contrived to make two back to back just as the forties gave way to the fifties and then damned if he didn't do the very same thing as the fifties in turn became the sixties.

Joe: Actually I haven't been keeping myself lately) and visuals: Norma Desmond represents a bygone era and ironically it is Cecil B DeMille (playing himself) who tells Norma how far pictures have progressed and is THEN revealed to be directing wearing the riding breeches which were de riguer for movie directors IN THE SILENT ERA, a wonderful, typical and classic Wilder statement.

Norma hires Joe to ghost-write a screenplay for her come-back, but he soon finds he's as much a kept-man as a writer, enabling more than one of the has-been starlet's delusions. The characters of both Norma and Max are fascinating enough to keep the movie going, and their relationship turns out to be more than it seems. The cast includes a very young Jack Webb, actually speaking like a human being, and appearances by Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper, and Cecil B. DeMille as themselves.

But I still find it to be a long, flimsy, obvious movie with one static, overly drawn-out relationship, and a lazy second storyline with the blandest of bland characters. The whole concept is ridiculous. Who wanted to see the story of a failed writer, with the low ambition of being a kept boy, who squints his eyes and makes love to a horrible old shrew because he can't grow a pair to blow her off. That's the whole show for three quarters of the movie. A viewer just isn't asked to do much but pay attention. To make up for how little the story moves, it has a lot of over-the-top acing. I don't find it entertaining or particularly thoughtful. ",

You can see that completely in the character of Norma Desmond, played to perfection by Gloria Swanson. She believes that due to the sound era coming into effect, all the great silent stars that are far superior are being ruined into obscurity. Basically, she blames sound for brainwashing the public. Yet, as we watch, we realize more and more that she is brainwashed into thinking she is still the star she once was. Wilder and Brackett have tremendous fun in this tremendous script that has to be one of the best ever written. It is so cleverly written, with touches of comedy, romance, and drama that it is hard to understand what type of film this is. To put it bluntly, this is revenge on Hollywood. And it continues to hold up today with all that is happening in films. See it once for its quality film-making, but see it again for the smacks Wilder puts on Hollywood. He has some good points, maybe too many.",

The filming and story line and a nice flow to it, making it smoothly drift along Joe Gillis's story of his life and the troubles he is going through on the last days of his life. Gloria Swanson almost didn't agree to acting in the film, but personally I am glad she didn't since no one else would probably have been able to play the part of Norma Desmond, the used to be star.

143,11 May 2006,johno-21,10, A collision of two eras,"I've seen this many times. From the moment it was made it was destined to be a classic. William Holden plays a B-movie screenwriter struggling in Hollywood and about to get his car repossessed when he pulls into a driveway of an old mansion owned by a silent screen star, played by Gloria Swanson, who has long faded from the public's and Hollywood's memory and lives as a recluse. Her butler, played by Eric Von Stroheim, is the first of her three husbands and who as former director discovered her. Holden grabs an opportunity to live in the mansion and write a screenplay for the Norma Desmond character's comeback to films. She falls in love with him with designs on him being her fourth husband and things start unraveling. Also in the cast are Nancy Olson, Fred Clark, Jack Webb and in wonderfully scripted cameo roles are a cast of stars from the silent movie era, director Cecil B. DeMille, actor-comedian Buster Keaton, actress Ann Q. Nilsson, actress-turned present day gossip columnist Hedda Hopper and actor H.B Warren. Stroheim is also from the silent era as is Swanson herself. She made 58 silent films in just 16 years between 1914 and 1930 and was one of Hollywood's biggest names but only made five films in the 30's and by 1934 with the film Music in the Air at age 37 her career ended. She returned in 1941 to make a comeback film but disappeared again until she got the role in Sunset Boulevard at the age of 53. A role she played so convincingly that it would typecast her as Norma Desmond and she only made one other film before disappearing from the big screen once again. She would show up occasionally on television and made a couple more screen roles late in her life. John Seitz is the film's cinematographer who himself got his start photographing silent films in a long 45 year career where he was never out of work. He had been the cinematographer on such silent film classics as The Prisoner of Zenda, The Arab, and Scarmouche to name a few so he was an ideal choice to photographer this film. His career also would go on to include The Lost Weekend, The Big Clock, Double Indemnity and Sullivan's Travels. Famed writer director Billy Wilder was making a name for himself and had already directed such pictures as The Lost Weekend, A Foreign Affair and Double Indemnity. Wilder wrote the screenplay with Charles Brackett and D.M. Marshman Jr. The film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won three for Best Art Direction, Best Music Score and Best Screenplay. among it's 11 nominations were Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Editing and a heavily nominated cast in Holden for Best Actor, Swanson for Best Actress, Olson for Best Supporting Actress and Von Stroheim for Best Supporting Actor. The Academy Awards for 1950 were All About Eve vs. Sunset Boulevard with the two films nominated for a total of 25 awards with nine nominations between the two casts alone. Sunset Boulevard also won four Golden Globe Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress and Best Score and received an additional three Globe nominations. It's film noir, drama, satire, dark comedy and comes close to a horror story too. If you like any or all of those genre categories you'll like this film. If you have an appreciation for the silent era films as I do you'll like this even more. I give it a 10 out of 10.",

157,4 August 2006,caa821,10, Whole exceeds parts - but still to be recommended,"Like many things, some movies can be described as a ""whole which exceeds the sum of its parts."" This film is one of those - and ""parts"" can reference both the general description as in the term, as well as those ""parts"" played by the cast members. Gloria Swanson overplays her character (nothing new for Ms. Swanson), as one would expect from the faded, silent-screen, delusional actress she portrays - and in view of the fact that overacting was more prevalent in the era during which this picture was filmed, especially those in the film noir genre. However, Gloria not only chews the scenery like an avid beaver, but like a whole colony of them. Erich Von Stroheim looks as though at any moment he will be joined by Dr. Frankenstein and Igor. William Holden (outstanding in so many roles, from ""The Moon is Blue"" and ""Stalag 17"" onward), and Nancy Olson, make June and Ward Cleaver, or the Bradys, look like deep, mysterious couples. But in spite of all of this, the movie is, as a whole, interesting and fascinating, not just when viewed as it would have been contemporaneously, but as a true relic of a film now over a half-century old. Whether this is because of - or in spite of - the performances is the question to be answered. I believe it is the latter, but whichever, it is well worth seeing.",

What was best, for me however, was the sympathy that both the lead characters managed to evoke in spite of their obvious and outrageous flaws.  What could be more realistic, pitiful, but superbly tragic than the butler writing phony fan letters to his faded star employer?  The fact that Sunset Boulevard was filmed in black and white I believe added to the power of the acting and the effectiveness of the narrative in the sense that it lent a grimy aspect to what was truly a dirty little story of personal failure. I also believe that because it was in black and white, I was never distracted by the scenery or the beauty of the sets and I was able to concentrate on the central aspects of the acting of William Holden and Gloria Swanson and the story they were portraying.

178,9 September 1999,Pat-54,10, A Hollywood Masterpiece,"I have always been a movie fan.  As a small child, I preferred a vintage movie over a cartoon any day.  At age 12, during a visit with my family to the famous ""Farmer's Market"" in Los Angeles, I found myself standing next to screen legend Gloria Swanson, and to her astonishment I not only knew who she was, but informed her that she was ""robbed"" when she was not given an Oscar for her performance in ""Sunset Boulevard."" That was 34 years ago, and I still believe Gloria should have taken home the golden man.  Her brilliant performance has not been dimmed by the passage of time and the film is still an unchanged masterpiece. Brilliantly directed by Billy Wilder, who wrote the script with Charles Brackett, it was a side of Hollywood that was totally unseen before.  (The Hollywood of 1950 still believed their own publicity.)  But this story, so biting in its reality left many shocked and angry.  Wilder held the mirror up, and few were pleased with the reflection.  (Legend has it that MGM boss, Louis B. Mayer, stormed out of a screening and had to be subdued before he could punch the nose of very amused Billy Wilder.) I have seen the film countless times and never tire of seeing it again, so recently when I noticed that American Movie Classics was showing it one afternoon, I tuned in.  But this time, I made a promise to myself to keep my eyes off Gloria Swanson.  Her charactor of Norma Desmond so dominates the story that even when she is off screen, she is all you can think about.  So the film began and I watched everybody but her and was amazed that I saw the film in a totally different light. At first, I was extremely sympathetic to Joe Gillis, played by William Holden.  After all, he was struggling writer who just wanted his shot at success.  Circumstances, not by his choice, threw him into the world of Norma Desmond, a world where her star had shone bright above all the others, but dimmed, as he described, ""10,000 midnights ago.""  It was here that my feelings for Joe changed for the first time.  As I said, the film is so dominated by the presence of Gloria Swanson that I had failed to see something that was very plain for all to see.  Joe Gillis, as played by Holden, was not a victim at all, he was the guy in the black hat.  He was the bad guy. The original choice of to play Joe was 29 year-old Montgomery Clift.  This casting would have validated the supposed age difference between Norma and Joe. Clift, who had been in a similar liaison in the early stages of his career with singer Libby Holman, got cold feet and backed out of the project.  Holden was the replacement for two reasons, he was under contract with Paramount and he was available.  So despite his initial reservations, William Holden accepted the role.  Gloria Swanson looked the same age as the 31 year-old Holden, a fact that did not go unnoticed by Gloria herself. Wilder had requested the make up department to age the youthful looking 49 year-old actress during pre-production test shots until a frustrated Swanson snapped back; ""Why don't you try and make him (Holden) look younger?""",

Wonderful film has Gloria Swanson basically playing herself (minus the insanity of course) as a former darling of the silent screen, Norma Desmond, who couldn't make the transition to talking pictures.  She is joined by her butler and Joe, an out of luck writer, who becomes her pet in a sense.  Norma's major problem is that she cannot accept that her time has passed and she is convinced that she can make a comeback. Joe realizes that Norma is a has been, and sets out to find new things but as the movie progresses we see just how vindictive and clinging she can be. I will not spoil the climax but it leads to one of the most unforgettable scenes in Hollywood history as Norma slowly descends the stairs, preparing for her ""close up"" with a possessed look on her face. Simply incredible film with amazing performances on everyone's part along with some notable cameos from former silent film stars and Cecille Demille.  A movie not to be missed.",

Cecil DeMille much older than she is still working. The script cuts the Hollywood glamour to a number that says young actresses only. This film should have won Best Picture, but the Oscar Board didn't give it, because the whole film industry was shown for the cruel town that it really is.
William Holden should have won an Oscar and didn't. Gloria Swanson should have won an Oscar and didn't.
I have one criticism of the plot. The locks had been taken off the doors. Under the careful watch of Von Stroheim, how did Swanson get hold of a loaded gun?
I loved when Von Stroheim played the organ with those white gloves he never took off. I loved when Gloria played Charlie Chaplin. I loved when she and Holden watched her silent films. The Isotta Frachetta car they drove around was also wonderful.
Swanson's walk down the staircase with the lights, cameras rolling, and of course us sitting in the dark watching captures the core of all Hollywoods' glory and tragedy. She let the dream enfold her says Holden the narrator from beyond the grave.

Surprisingly, I went into Sunset Blvd. blindly. I wasn't quite sure what the true premise of the film was nor was I aware of its genre. The film and title, of course, is especially famous- another timeless classic. So, as the picture commences with a character who's dying to make it ""big"" in Hollywood, I was already hooked right from the start. Suddenly, he's being chased by repossession men and desperately attempting to escape the eerie atmosphere of Norma Desmond's gigantic home. May I say just how substantially creepy I found Norma Desmond and the depressing, desolate environment she surrounded Joe with? From the hair-raising music to the sinister look on Norma's face all the way to the overall mystery of Joe's situation forced me to strongly grip the handles of my office chair, hoping Joe returns to the city, that's filled with excited and friendly faces, as soon as possible. Then again, with the setting comes the movie's presentation of this interesting juxtaposition between Norma's more optimistic perspective on her Hollywood career versus Joe's more sardonic and restrained outlook on the industry's patterns.

Whenever she arches her eyebrows and her eyes get big and she starts to go crazy, her performance is so magnetic. She truly becomes her character.  It probably wasn't hard for her to do; she, after all, was a glamorous silent film star herself who had all but disappeared from the scene for years before this movie was made.  But her sharp delivery of the dialogue makes you believe every word she says.  That isn't to say that the rest of the film isn't good.  William Holden is very good, especially in those biting, darkly funny voice-overs.  Erich Von Stroheim is very eerie as the devoted butler Max.  (He was a silent-film director in real-life who made six-hour epics in the 20's, one of whcih actually starred Swanson.  He did not, however, discover her and never married her.)  The direction focuses heavily on the dark, fobodding, almost misty atmosphere of the whole thing, and the movie's all the better for it.

Hollywood Boulevard brilliantly portrays the harsh and brutal nature of Hollywood. It is pathetic seeing Norma Desmond, sitting in the dark watching her old films, but it is also poignant and sad too.

If the sight of dour butler Erich Von Stroheim isn't enough to get him to turn around and rush out of there, the sun-glassed older lady who mistakes him for an undertaker should be.

You feel there is a chance he and Nancy Olsen's character will be able to get away from her and live their lives in peace together but the story is a tragedy so there has to be some disappointments. Norma (Swanson) refuses to let Joe (Holden) go but he still persists and she kills him. The audience tends to pity Norma for losing her career in the movies and for desperately trying to hold on to it (she surrounds herself with old publicity pictures of herself for comfort) even though it's dead and has no chance of redemption. After killing Holden, she practically becomes oblivious to the deed and suffocates herself into believing, ""I am the greatest star there ever was"". It is a great American classic.

Basically set in the 1950's Hollywood, movie screenplay writer Joe C. Gillis (Oscar nominated William Holden) narrates the story going to flashback that leads up to the murder seen at the beginning. Joe is struggling to get his work sold to any studios and has debts, and one night he ends up with his car getting a flat tyre and at the mansion of a former silent movie star on Sunset Boulevard. Norma Desmond (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Gloria Swanson) lives alone with butler and driver Max Von Mayerling (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Erich Von Stroheim), and has been doing so for many years since losing her popularity, becoming deluded and demented since, believing that one day she could return to the industry. Max being her ex-husband and former director who still has feelings for her is very protective of Norma, but she wants Joe to move in to the mansion to write a new screenplay for her to make her comeback, and in the process her becomes her lover and gigolo. Even though he is getting paid for doing this, he slowly starts feeling trapped, and seeking friendship he leaves one night to see Artie Green (Jack Webb), and he bumps into studio reader Betty Schaefer (Oscar nominated Nancy Olson). They quickly become attracted to each other, but Joe still returns Norma feeling some very warped sense of loyalty to the old actress, of course he still meets up with Betty to help her with her own script idea. By the time it seems the couple have fallen in love, Norma finds out and feels extremely jealous, she tries to sabotage whatever they have together. In the end Joe makes the hasty decision to threaten to leave the mansion, and that is when Norma really loses her mind and shoots him dead, so he has been narrating from beyond the grave, and with the press showing up about the murder her demented mind of fantasy thinks that she has made her longed after comeback.

226,23 March 2022,hnt_dnl,10, Top 10 film in history,"SUNSET BOULEVARD (1950) is a film that I discovered in my youth that has always stuck with me. And it's just as powerful, emotional, and memorable over 70 years after it came out in theaters. THE ultimate scathing indictment and essay on the cold, ruthless nature of Hollywood. The film was nominated for 11 Oscars, won 3, and should have won more, but especially Gloria Swanson, who was nominated Best Actress, should have won. This is probably one of the top 10 performances in history that didn't win an Oscar. And her competition wasn't exactly shabby as she was up against dual All About Eve threats Bette Davis and Anne Baxter, as well as Eleanor Parker for Caged, and the actual winner Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday. The popular take it should have come down to Swanson and Davis, but that Baxter took votes that might have gone to both of those ladies, so that Holliday managed to steal the award due to the split voting. No matter, Swanson is the one who should have won the gold. Her performance is by far one of the most fascinating and unforgettable in film history.",
227,4 June 2020,LeonardKniffel,10, Gloria Swanson Gives the Performance of the Century,"Exactly in the middle of the 20th century, Gloria Swanson delivered one of the best performances in film history. I have seen this movie countless times, but I can always find something new to admire. Watching it as an old person is very different from watching it young when I thought Swanson's portrayal of Norma Desmond was camp; now it seems like pure pathos. The style of the film is noir, melodramatic and eerily gothic, but Swanson's best scenes are not only the classic descending the staircase or snapping ""I am big; it's the pictures that got small."" The scene in which she begs Joe (William Holden) to love her is heartbreaking. I used to feel a bit sorry for Joe, bamboozled as he was into her trap; not so now. Holden's character is a liar and an absolute cad. Even when he seems to genuinely care for her after the suicide attempt, he is really caring only for himself. When the movie was released in 1950 the idea of a woman of 50--who we are told has been washed up for the previous 20 years, which means she must have been through at 30-- falling for a man half her age must have been shocking. But it really does tell the story of how Hollywood treated its great leading ladies. No such revulsion for the male matinee idols who regularly played love scenes with girls half their age. In Sunset Boulevard, we are told in so many scenes that Joe was practically nauseated by the idea of making love to her, but he is such a user that he continues to feed her delusions. It is also interesting to note that we are never shown a sexual scene, certainly not one of those deep kisses that Humphrey Bogart and Gary Cooper regularly planted on actresses who should have been playing their daughters. Is Sunset Boulevard over the top? You bet, way over, and I cannot get enough of it.",
228,22 October 2003,nutsy,10," Wilder's best, Holden's best, one of the best.","Billy Wilder's classic SUNSET BLVD. is probably Hollywood's best self-loathing look at itself. William Holden is great as a struggling screenwriter running from his creditors who encounters has-been silent film star Gloria Swanson (who is pretty much playing herself in the guise of Norma Desmond). Her tragic character and her decaying palace of a home are very heavy and very dark, the kind of thing that only a great comedy directer like Billy Wilder could give us. Erich Von Strohiem appears as Swanson's butler who was a silent film director (as the actor was in real life). The truth of these performances is part of what makes the film's statement about Hollywood so delightfully bitter. Watching this film will prove to anyone that the hype and reputation are entirely justified. The film viewer of today can appreciate the connection to David Lynch's supposed homage MULHOLLAND DR. about another dark tale associated with another L.A. street. See both films, but see this one first.",

A very dark movie, with everything right ion place. Holden is excellent, though at times his voice-over narration is a little arch. Swanson is fascinating. (What could this possibly have been like with Wilder's original choices -- Mae West for Norma and Montgomery Clift? Clift would have been good but West, much as I love her, would have sunk it.) Holden's interest in Nancy Olson has never quite made sense to me. She is attractive and appealing but her wholesomeness breaks the mood. That may have been the writer and director's intention. If so, I'd call it misguided. But who am I? Bill Wilder is one of the finest directors this country has ever known and I do not propose to second-guess him.",

Gloria Swanson is the true star of this film. As William Holden's character has no real money left, he eventually stumbles upon Norma Desmond's home.

Gloria Swanson was really an actress forgotten by cinema, Erich Von Stroheim a German director, not famous anymore and Buster Keaton and the other ""ghosts"" were really living in those conditions.

These are the painful words from aging actress Norma Desmond as she grapples with fame right after she committed a murder. This phrase is one of the most memorable phrases in cinema's history. Billy Wilder has a knack of making such endings in his movies as evidenced by Some Like It Hot. Sunset Blvd. Is one of the best movies about Hollywood. It tackles a very relevant topic as it deals with fame and what happens when fame run its course. The movie is every bit of a film-noir as it is a comedy. Just like Wilder did with Double Indemnity, he created a movie that thrills at nearly every turn and the relationship between William Holden and Gloria Swanson keeps coming and grabbing you until the shocking ending. You can also classify the movie as a black comedy. Personally, I did not have any belly rolls but rather uncomfortable giggles which is by design. The pet monkey funeral sequence is just an example of one that illicit such giggles. Regardless of the genre, the movie is about as good as it can be. It is a surefire classic and one that cements Billy Wilder's as cinema's most impressive director.",

I did find it very hard to deal with Gloria Swanson even though she played a magnificent role and casting her was perfect for the role she had. You could tell she was a silence film actress because you could see how she used expressions and looks to portray just how she was feeling or dealing with things. This is what made it very hard for me to deal with this women. I felt the director did appropriate job of selecting a cast that met the demands of the movie including Nancy Olsen who plays the woman who gets William Holdens mojo for writing back. The score and dark ominous lighting did a amazing job of portraying just how dark a road William holden's character was moving down the line and just how far and extreme it might get to escape it. This is why the beginning scene which happens to be the last scene sets off a great example of what can happen in life if you just accept things and let people start to run your life. Wiliam Holden knew there was no escaping the dark, scary tones of what Gloria Swanson's life had become because without her he truly had nothing.

Some people just don`t accept the way things get different as years go by. They find it difficult to understand what is happening around them. That`s the idea of this film. An old actress still live the old years she was successful and doesn`t really see people don`t think of her anymore. She lives alone in an old big house and she is assisted by a loyal man who serves and takes care of her. One day, a young writers gets there by chance and he gets involved with the old lady. That`s when the movie really begins. These two people discuss their points of view, talk about their experiences and make us feel good watching it all. I can`t tell much of the film, cause it talks by itself. I just have to say Billy Wilder is brilliant! He shows again he was one of the best directors ever! I also have to say people should have more respect for the ones who came first. Old people still must be heard and respected, cause they will always have something to say and to teach us.",

As luck would have it, however, while trying to elude some men attempting to repossess his automobile a flat tire causes him to drive into what he thinks is an abandoned mansion on Sunset Boulevard. Once there he is met by an elderly man named ""Max Von Mayerling"" (Erich von Stroheim) who motions for him to come into the house as the owner wishes to see immediately. It's then that he meets a former silent movie actress by the name of ""Norma Desmond"" (Gloria Swanson) who mistakes him for a funeral director called upon to bury a pet. Once the error is corrected she informs him that she has a script for a movie she has been working on and would like his professional opinion on it as she is planning on returning to the movie business to reclaim her former glory. Although he accepts her eventual offer of employment what Joe doesn't tell her is that the film industry has long since evolved and she simply doesn't have the talent necessary for such a return. What Joe doesn't understand is the danger associated with her mental and emotional instability during this particular time. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining drama which benefited from good performances by all involved.

DeMille: Absolute masterpiece representing a place where dreams happened for one Gloria Swanson who was a big silent star but now her fame is fading and she dreams her life away with private screenings of her own films. Narrated by William Holden who is sheltered at her mansion in return for a screenplay that will resurrect her. Intriguing setup rich in dialogue and plot turns that result in the ultimate revelation in the conclusion. Billy Wilder does an excellent job at presenting ill fate Hollywood careers due to technology. Wilder previously made an entirely different film called Double Indemnity and both share a common theme of dominating femme figure. Swanson delivers a riveting performance of a woman illusion to total madness. Holden feels his talent trapped and seeks escape through an outside project. Erich von Stroheim is the ex-husband who lives to revive her past. He will be instrumental in assisting her concluding performance and famous last words. Nancy Olson plays a screenwriter unable to unlock Holden's thoughts. She is engaged yet will face Holden's forced lifestyle in blunt terms. Great cameo performances by film personalities portraying themselves, including famed director Cecil B. DeMille. It is the dark side of show business where stars flicker no more. Score: 10 / 10",

It is inexplicable that Swanson did not win the Academy award the only way you can rationalize it is that she had been away from films for many years and the Academy didn't know Swanson.

Perhaps I should not have watched it so soon after seeing Aronofsky's mother! That film is full of terrifying emotions and selfish actions supposedly in the service of selflessness. And here, something not altogether different but so mannered, so other worldly. The beginning is great, all mystery and ambiguity, the scene where we visit Paramount Studios and meet the real Cecil B DeMille directing while a spotlight is turned upon our crazy heroine is fantastic. But so much of this is mundane and repetitive. I understand Mae West was considered for the role and at first I thought, what nonsense, but on reflection perhaps playing this for laughs would have been preferable to this arch campiness. Holden is fine, not someone with much charisma, and I've certainly seen him better. What he lacks here is any sense that this is really going on. I know in 1950 a bed scene between the two would probably have been too much (though goodness knows there were enough film folk of maturity bedding nymphets at the time) but maybe just an unmade bed or something to indicate he had some connection with this wretched creature.",
275,7 July 2022,I_Ailurophile,10, 'Sunset Boulevard' is one of the greatest movies you'll ever see.,"Los Angeles setting. Wry, reflective narration. Cutting dialogue, biting and sometimes grim or morbid humor, timeless cultural references. Above all: characters with huge personality; increasingly tangled relationships and circumstances; a course of events that slowly spirals out beyond manageability. This is a film noir, alright, and more than that, it's unquestionably one of the definitive pictures of the genre. Yet these are just broad descriptive terms for the nutritious substance of the movie - the details are the garnish, the spices, that add tremendous flavor. And, oh, how delicious it is. The production design and art direction are exemplary, filling every scene with delightful sights and sounds at every corner. The costume design, hair and makeup work, and above all set design and decoration are wonderfully fetching, a real treat for the eyes. The lines given to star William Holden for the protagonist's narration are brilliant in their sharp wit, and nigh poetic vocabulary and arrangement, and Holden delivers each with a dark panache that amounts to verbal instant gratification. And whatever the mood of a given scene, so it is for much of the dialogue at large, both Holden's, and Gloria Swanson's, and Erich von Stroheim's, and everyone's. In fact: it's one matter to see a feature described as one of the best movies ever made, but to watch it for oneself and confirm that truth is an altogether fabulous experience.

279,2 October 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8, Monkey business.,"'Sunset Blvd. (1950)', a veritable cinematic classic, is surprisingly meta, comprised almost entirely of interlaced 'Easter eggs' which take the form of 'art imitating life', celebrity cameos and, of course, movie references. This 'self-eating snake' nature is perhaps appropriate considering that the piece is still one of the best, most in-depth insights into - and a near damnation of - Hollywood, specifically 'old Hollywood'. It's also a keen portrayal of a sad kind of self-obsession usually associated with famous artists, one that the person often clings to beyond all hope primarily because their personality is so intrinsically tied to it. This self-perpetuating cycle of defining one's worth by how much strangers 'admire' them is certainly toxic and is, quite boldly, on full display. Ultimately, the picture is rather bleak, showcasing how society often enables dangerous behaviour by awarding it with their attention. The themes I've mentioned would be enough to float an entire flick but this one has even more still. It looks at money, financial security, loneliness, emasculation, creativity, mental illness and attention-seeking behaviour. It's remarkably interesting. It's also consistently entertaining, styled with a lavish 'noir' aesthetic that paints every frame, along with the usually decrepit things within them, in a beautiful black-and-white hue that somehow has a real thematic resonance in and of itself. The purposefully heavy-handed, hard-boiled but often flowery narration adds to the narrative's eerily enigmatic nature. The story is seemingly straight-forward, yet it's also oddly bizarre in the best way possible. Everything just feels like it's on top-form, here. The direction uses dazzling camera-work to invigorate the dialogue-based plot, beginning with an absolutely brilliant one-shot title-sequence and otherwise featuring its lion's share of inventive angles (the under-water shot is a real highlight and a proper bit of technical wizardry, too). The performances perfectly walk the line of realism and 'showbiz', with the balance being palpably different for each character. Swanson's Norma Desmond almost feels like she's acting in a silent movie, oozing intensity from every facial feature, whereas Holden's Joe Gillis slowly transitions from a 'Golden era' star to a paranoid, under-the-thumb man who thinks he's trapped with some sort of 'B-movie' monster and may actually like it. Tying everything together is this 'behind-the-scenes' feel. You're being taken on a tour of the very thing that produces pictures like this and people like Desmond. The more you read about it after the fact, the more you realise that it must've been shot through some sort of mirror. It may be a fictional tale, but it resembles reality in more ways than it doesn't and sometimes simply presents it to you (or a version of it, at least). Its haunting end is one of the most famous of all time but the whole affair is worthy of that status. It's an ahead-of-its-time experience that's as enjoyable as it impressive. As I said, it's a classic. 8/10",

It was from Billy wilder, so I was expecting a lot of surprises like The Double Indemnity. He didn't disappoint me at all. The film is one of the best examples of films in which much thought is given for story. The thing which kept me attached was the authoritative narration.

287,8 May 2010,pinkpanther1164,7, Sunset Boulevard,"Sunset Boulevard from 1950 is a magnificently twisted Film Noir. Norma Desmond was a once extremely famous Hollywood Actress. Everyone knew who she was, loved her films and her mind absolutely adored her. What Norma doesn't realize is that she has been out of the spotlight for a longtime. She has been hiding away in her once gorgeous home, holding on to what she once was. Her house is very reflective of what she herself had become over the years. The house hadn't received much attention and in turn has become dull and un-groomed; Norma Desmond did the same. Joe Gillis is a screenwriter that has also been struggling with his career. He manages to fall in to Norma's world, and in the end shatters it. Joe agrees to help Norma with her comeback film, but in the process realizes that nobody is waiting to see it. Norma's mental state isn't always logical, but her character makes you feel for her. She was once this beautiful actress that was on top of the film world; now she's lucky if she is a distant memory. This is a dark film that shows what fame can do to a person. Norma seems as though she is stuck in the spotlight and doesn't know how to live life otherwise.

290,6 January 2023,CinemaSerf,7, Sunset Blvd.,"""Gillis"" (William Holden) is a down-at-heel script writer who is struggling to keep his head above water. Not having had any successes for a while, his car is about to be repossessed and his erstwhile boss ""Sheldrake"" (Fred Clark) has nothing for him. On the run from the pursuing repo men, he turns his car into the drive of a decaying old mansion. Hiding his car in the garage, he is mistaken by the house's owner for an undertaker - she has a small matter that needs attending too! Realising her error she demands he leave, but not before he mentions what he does for a living. She has a script. Hundreds of pages of script - and she offers him a job, champagne and caviar if he will edit and refine it so ""Norma Desmond"" (Gloria Swanson), a retired former silent movie star, can present it to her favourite director Cecil B DeMille and restart her glorious career. Initially just seeing dollar signs, he agrees and what now ensues is a masterfully crafted story of love, dependency, ambition and delusion in which Swanson absolutely shines. It's clear to us from the outset that her grasp on reality is somewhat limited, and but for her dedicated factotum ""Max"" (Erich von Stroheim) she might well have fallen victim to her own depression many years ago. Holden is also on solid form here, his initial selfishness starts to morph into something more, he begins to care for this woman whose head is increasingly in the clouds, and upon whom she is becoming more reliant. The dialogue is delivered via a mix of Holden's quite honest narrative and the conversations between the characters delivering some of the best lines in cinema - ""I'm still big - it's the world that's got smaller!"". The mental decline and instability of ""Desmond"" is expertly displayed here by a star who new a thing or two herself about the silent film scene, and who brings her facial expressions, her mannerisms and her generally star-studded demeanour to bear really effectively as the audience gradually realise that nothing here is going to pan out as it seems - or as anyone wants. Von Stroheim underplays his supporting role with aplomb and though I didn't really love the sub-plot with Nancy Olson's ""Betty Schaefer"" - it took away from the intensity of the main storyline - it did to serve to illustrate just how powerful jealousy can be. This is a super film, that still captivates on a big screen and is really well worth sitting down to watch.,",

308,7 May 2023,GusherPop,9, Billy Wilder Classic and masterpiece,"Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond in Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard (1950) is one of Paramount's biggest stars. The film's argument about the bad old days of Hollywood is more complicated than that, as the studio system was starting to crumble and the beginnings of the industry were coming back to haunt it. Desmond's pride mocks the fall of Hollywood just as it was teetering, rocked by the antitrust laws, the coming of TV and the communist witch-hunts. Desmond lives in a dusty seclusion on Sunset Boulevard with her butler Max, until a young screenwriter, Joe Gillis (William Holden), stumbles across her house and ensnares him to become her script editor and lover. Gillis initially feels pity for Desmond and compares her house to Miss Havisham, who has been rejected. Desmond is deluded about her fame and importance to the modern movie industry, while Gillis and his young pals live cheaply and crack wise about the industry. They are cynical and smart enough not to be fooled by it. The crumbling Hollywood of Sunset Boulevard is built on the silent era, with Betty's family being a cinema dynasty due to her stunt work for Pearl White. Norma Desmond made Paramount Studios a success, not the other way around. The faltering movie business was built on stronger, more ambitious grounds than it occupied in 1950. Norma Desmond still causes a ripple of excitement when she enters the soundstage, but the pictures that got small. Swanson made a successful transition into the talkies and then went on to be a successful business woman, remaining a very public figure. She first appeared on film as a teenager in 1914 and lived until she was 84. The most telling difference between Desmond and Swanson is that Swanson left Paramount to sign with United Artists and take control of her own career. She made films and career choices that marked her out as a modern woman, frank by the standards of the day about sexuality and married life. Her first hits were brisk sex comedies directed by DeMille such as Don't Change Your Husband (1919) and Male and Female (1919). By 1928 she was courting controversy with her passion project Sadie Thompson (1928), a steamy Somerset Maugham adaptation directed by Raoul Walsh.",

It deserves all the praise that it has received and will always receive. Every facet of the film is done so well, especially the performances by the ever talented actors. Gloria Swanson absolutely made this film, her performance will blow you away. She commands every scene she's in, she has to because of her character. Her character is so complex and interesting, so much so that it's impossible to look away. The story revolves around a man who stumbles upon an old seemingly abandoned mansion and meets a middle aged washed up actress named Norma Desmond. She showers him with lavish gifts and lets him stay at her Hollywood mansion in exchange for him reading a script she wrote and editing it for her. Eventually, things become very complicated when other factors are thrown into the mix. And then that's where we get the real meat of the film. It really is a great film that is very entertaining. It may be very old, but it'll never lose it's quality or it's well deserved place on the list of the most famous films ever. 9/10",

I had the general idea of where the movie was going but I was still really excited to see what will happens next, perfectly constructed story and what a way to end a great drama with a great big metaphor of the killing of Joe Gillis.

The plot is that Joe is avoiding having his car repossessed by hiding out in an out of work actresses house, played by Gloria Swansen, who did the best acting job of her career in this film.

The casting of Von Stroheim, Swanson, Webb, and of course Holden is perfect. The cameo with DeMille incredible. Maybe its because I am a filmmaker myself that I get so much joy out of this film. I don't watch many films more than once but I just saw this again and couldn't pull myself away. The dialogue, cinematography, editing, sound and music are exacting, as a great film should be.

Well, Sunset Boulevard answers that non-specific question in a beautiful fashion and then some by telling a story about 'delusions of grandeur' and how time's passage can become an unforgiving beast for movie stars still gloating about their 'good old days'. Norma Desmond is an out-of-touch actress who's refused to come to terms with, or accept, reality. She happens to come across struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis escaping from the men who lent him his car. After skidding onto the former star's driveway by coincidence, Joe's life takes one dark turn after another: and the film's look into career realism as well as its equally potent career naivety (even if the person it's coming from has more experience in real life).

None of the relationships felt real, it was like a bad stage play with characters that I did not care about. The characters in the film even quipped about writing movies which are cheap to produce, and that is exactly what ""Sunset Blvd."" is, basically a cheap staged play set right in Hollywood.

Gloria Swanson especially shined in this film. What she was able to do with her eyes, facial expressions, as well as her body language alongside her actual line delivery was truly noteworthy. I feel like this film foreshadowed a great deal about the Hollywood movie industry with how it was becoming bigger and more complex and it showed how it changed even just in the first half of the 20th century (and makes you think how different it is now from even then). It also demonstrated how narcissism/self-obsession and obsession with the past can truly ruin an individual and their sanity.

You could cruise it and there were places it could be walked for blocks and nightclubs galore. I even visited an old empty mansion in the hills, broke into it and walked around. Everyone said it was haunted and the police used to come and chase people away. Great night out. Some of that nostalgia is captured in this movie and is in the background as well as theme of the movie. As far as the movie itself goes, it is a good story, well told and acted out to perfection. It presents an older woman using a younger man for her vain and selfish purposes and the man going along with it first out of necessity and later on like an insect in a spider's web. Stuck and no where to go with a hungry female prowling around. Nicely done on this point and the point of everyone coming to Hollywood to struggle until they got recognized for anything and start to make some real money. Schwabs drugstore in the movie was a real hangout too. BTW...when one wasn't on Sunset Blvd they were cruising Hollywood Blvd. There was always some action going on these two streets. Lastly, I got the chills watching this as I had a woman chasing me just like this one chased William Holden (no sex) offering me money, free lunches/dinners and gifts galore if I only devote myself to her. Mind you I am married but it didn't stop this obsessive person including her making me her heir. I even told her off (many times) and she would not let go. Creepy and dysfunctional to say the least.

A master of genre versatility, Wilder makes significant alterations to film noir with the addition of a light comedic backdrop, still managing to close on a note of poignancy that lingers in the mind, cementing the film as a landmark in movie history.",

It's the pictures that got small.,"A dead man narrates Sunset Boulevard, eager to tell us his version of the events, the cold, hard facts, before they are distorted and blown out of proportion by the radio and television screen. Joe Gillis is a writer, and naturally wants his story to retain its integrity. Wilder gives us a witty snapshot of that idea disappearing in a puff of smoke early in the film, where Joe pitches his baseball script to an producer in a dinghy little office. Firstly it's openly mocked by a script reader (the demure yet snappy Nancy Olson) who wants something grandiose and with a message. ""You'd have turned down Gone with the Wind!"" splutters Joe in exasperation. ""No, that was me,"" remarks the producer with resignation. Almost absent-mindedly whilst lounging on the couch, he twists Joe's story into an all-female spectacle with musical interludes, with the screen credit the only remaining vestige of the initial premise. And when Joe pleas for a personal loan, he launches into a spiel about his own spiralling debts that Wilder quickly cuts away from. There's no need for semantics; he's hemorrhaging money, like most of Hollywood, where original ideas are sparse and basic plots are organised by numbers and letters. ",
332,5 August 2004,BumpyRide,8, No Betty!,"Man, sure seems like people love to write mini-books on this site about Sunset Blvd. I'll try to keep my opinion concise and to the point. First, don't shoot me, but I think this is a good movie, but not a great one. It could have been a great movie, and it's certainly a classic, but I think it falls short, and here is why. The forgotten movie star living in a dilapidated, spooky mansion off Sunset Blvd. is a terrific setting. Great casting abounds with Gloria Swanson and hottie William Holden, and the strange friends each of them have. But for me, this movie falls apart every time they pull away from Gloria to concentrate on Joe and Betty's budding romance. Why devote so much screen time to a bland character, Betty Schaefer, struggling to write a who cares script called ""Dark Windows"" or whatever it's called, when we could be spending more time with faded, kooky Norma Desmond in her scary house with Max? Face it, no body writes volumes about Nancy Olson's character do they? We all know who makes this movie great, and it ain't her. The only fun scene with Betty is when Norma (surprise!) is tracking her down on the phone. ",

For most director/writers ""Sunset Blvd."" would have been the height of their careers, their masterpiece, but for multi-talented Billy Wilder there were better pictures. ""Double indemnity,"" ""The Apartment,"" ""Some Like It Hot,"" and two highly underrated films ""Ace in the Hole"" and ""One, Two, Three"" are better written than ""Sunset Blvd."" Take off the tinsel and the viewer will find some cracks in ""Sunset Blvd."" One distraction is the narration by the body floating in the swimming pool. There's a cliché that dead men tell no tales. Well, a dead man tells one hell of a tale in this film. The movie takes forever to get to the essence of the story. It gets better and better as the movie progresses until it explodes at the end. The best scene in the whole film is the last scene when Norma Desmond gives what amounts to a soliloquy for the newsreel cameras. ",

Both take the point of view of the ambitions and the frustrations of leading ladies that lived long enough to witness their fading. Both were nominated for best film.

341,15 July 2014,RossRivero99,10, The best movie of 1950,"Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard is the very suspenseful look at a screenwriter who doesn't have enough money (played by William Holden)and a silent star named Norma Desmond (played by Gloria Swanson) who has been waiting to get into the motion picture business for a long time wanting to make a film that she wanted Cecil B. DeMille to direct but had a terrible script. The film was suspenseful because we want to know why she was really that crazy, but her performance was still well done thanks to memorable lines, for example the most selfish line in the movie in the beginning where she says to Joe Gillis in her bedroom ""I am big, it's the pictures that got small, and the last line in the movie which is the most memorable line in the movie when she was filming in her house and the last line ""All right Mr. DeMille I'm ready for my closeup."". When Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett wrote the screenplay they wanted a frightening look at Hollywood like no other film director has done before. Not only do William Holden and Gloria Swanson have good performances but so does Eric Von Stroheim as her first husband and Desmond's butler.

Norma is portrayed more like an older, wealthy, eccentric, former movie star that just can't let go of her dream of being forever young, forever loved and forever a relevant star. Because her illness goes unrecognized and therefore untreated, she carries out a horrific act at the end and then we get to see the full extent of her illness as she enters the realm of nonreality and pretends to be back in the studio being filmed.

The story leaves something to be desired, even if it is well-written, as there's not a whole lot happening, and the acting, while good, never even comes close to Swanson's performance. That may be more due to Swanson than the others, but no one else really impressed. Certainly not all Oscar-calibre performances, as all of the main four were nominated.

It perfectly melds the noir genre with the general populous' interest in the stars. Unlike other movies at the time this film truly showed the dark side of Hollywood. The side filled with murder, affairs, and shady actions. It showcased how fame can mess with a person. Considering it was shot when it was it had some amazing angles. One of my favourites was the classic scene of Joe Gillis floating in the pool. This film also showcased a tremendous amount of symbolism. In almost every scene it was there it seemed. From Joe's chain getting caught on the gate to Norma Desmond getting hit by a boom microphone. It added a whole new layer.

360,2 September 2010,ilpohirvonen,9, A ruthless film about the flip side of the Hollywood glamor,"Billy Wilder, born in Austria-Hungary built himself a huge reputation during 1940's-60's in Hollywood. He's is best known for his comedies with Marilyn Monroe (Some Like It Hot, The Seven Year Itch), but his other films haven't remained in the shadows either. In 1944 he directed his film-noir masterpiece Double Indemnity, which became a big inspiration for many directors. In addition to these films Billy Wilder's trade mark is probably his own unique satire, best seen in One Two Three!, A Foreign Affair and of course in Sunset Blvd. In 1950 Billy Wilder was already at the top of his career, he produced his films himself and therefore had much more artistic freedom. This freedom allowed him to make a different kind of film with the screenwriter, Charles Brackett. Sunset Blvd. was no one night wonder, it took two years to finish it and the most time went to the writing. Brackett has told that someone suggested that they should make a film about a forgotten silent-era actress, who meets a desperate writer.

Now that 75 is the new 50, it's hard for us to imagine the sheer moxie -- and the steep risk of career-poisoning mockery -- put into play in 1949 when a 50-year-old actress long past her glamor-drenched prime became Norma Desmond, the only living soul who doesn't know her day is done and her sex appeal is long gone. I can't think of a precedent for a woman taking on such a perilous role in a serious movie, and I doubt that any of today's maturing -- OK, aging -- woman stars would do it on a dare, let alone agree to play side-by-side with film clips from their glory days. There are a few better films and a handful of better performances, but nobody ever undressed her own persona on screen with more daring and to better effect than Miss Swanson.

At the start of the film the viewer is introduced to the main character and the narrator of the film, floating dead in a pool. Right off the bat the audience is waiting for his demise during the whole film. Norma Desmond played by Gloria Swanson is one of those characters that the audience is just waiting to break. The entire film she seems to be on the brink of a meltdown and her obsession with reviving her movie career and her romance with Joe always seem to be pushing her closer and closer to the edge. In a way I found myself loving and hating Joe, at one second I would rooting for him to escape and be with Betty but at the same time he was stringing Norma along. The use of dark and light in the film give a real feel of what life was like for everyone inside Norma's estate. Most of the scenes inside her home are quite dark and gloomy while any of the scenes in which Joe escapes are bright and jovial. This reflects Hitchcocks use of dark and light in his film Notrious. Although the audience knows the whole time that Joe is going to be murdered and the film does not let you forget it, it really draws you in with the acting and camera-work.",
368,22 May 2022,daydreaming_overthinking_woman,10, Intriguing story with phenomenal acting!,"I saw this movie on the Positiv channel. Could never catch it from the very beginning, but the second time I managed to see more of the beginning than I did before. I went on Wikipedia to read what happens at the beginning. I won't share any spoilers, but I will say, I'm happy I didn't see it from the opening, because the ending really surprised me. Sometimes movies that show the ending at the beginning kind of take the fun out of watching to see what happens next. A young screenwriter named Joe Gillis (William Holden), who is struggling to stay afloat due to his poor writing, moves in with a self-absorbed, emotionally unbalanced former silent film star, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who is trying to make a comeback to the film industry. He agrees to work for her as a script doctor. She falls in love with him, and this causes problems, since he's not attracted to older women. Due to her romantic feelings not being reciprocated, she has incessant meltdowns and tries to make him feel guilty for refusing her advances. When she sees his name on a script next to that of a female's, with whom he was collaborating (Betty Schaefer, played by Nancy Olson) - and who he found himself having feelings for - she begins calling Betty repeatedly, trying to incite suspicion within her so she would stay away from him. The creepiness in this film was superbly portrayed. I also loved Joe's narration. I felt like it added an element of suspense. And Gloria Swanson was an excellent choice to play Norma Desmond. She is a really bizarre character. Her mansion is filled with nothing but pictures of herself. She has a New Year's Eve party and doesn't invite anyone. The weirdness of her personality and her vanity, along with the terror that Joe feels as he is living with her, make for a fascinating story. She's only his employer, but she starts controlling his life. She wants him to feel trapped in her house, and he is perpetually confused by her erratic behavior. Towards the end of the movie, Joe is unfazed by Norma's crying and over the top antics. There was some realism to that. When you spend time with a person who's always throwing temper tantrums, it reaches a point where it gets old. You know they have mental issues, but at the same time, you become burned out from dealing with their negative treatment of you.",
369,24 November 2016,PetarNeo,9, Hollywood in many shades,"Story about a screenwriter that is going through hard times selling his writing owning money. Accidentally finds himself in property of rich Hollywood star and his life changes and will not end well. Joe is a screenwriter that was hired by Norma, rich and once popular star, as they start living together despite his disapproval. His craving for money rises and it is consuming him but she starts to fall in love with him and their situation gets very complicated. Norma dreams of return to old track but it was all just a story told by Max, her assistant that deals with everything. In his search for comfort he befriends Betty, a reader that had bad opinion on his work, and now as they are working together behind Norma's back they are starting to develop feeling for each other. Finally he realizes that everything is choking him and he plans to ruin everything and let Becky go to her fiancé. As he leaves house Norma shoots him in back and he is left floating in pool. Police and reporters arrived and as Norma is leaving her room Max prepares scene for her and she feels like a star once more. Only problem with the film is pacing at times it feels very slow but incredible story and directing keeps us interested and going. Holden's performance as Joe is very nice as he is obviously struggling to keep everything in place and to have a decent life but in all drama and changing he got himself killed. Gloria Swanson is also very good as she is obsessed with Joe and herself at first place. Stroheim as Max was fabulous as he is calm but strong character with amazing attitude.

The fast-paced delivery of the lines really has the feel of an old classic movie. Symbolism was another good aspect in the way his gold chain gets caught on the door showing how Joe is trapped in Norma's life, as well as when Norma is bumped in the head with a microphone reminding her that her days of silent movie fame are over.

The dialogue, or should I say Holden's monologue, is razor sharp and bitterly ironic. Then the acting; William Holden does a more than solid job but it is the performance of Gloria Swanson that really is unforgettable. Theatrical, melodramatic and all the better for it. It's a great view to a bygone era with small roles of big names from that era. The original opening sets the tone of the film perfect. Definitely worth checking out if you haven't seen it yet.

What a unique film, the likes of which we simply do not see anymore. Told in flashback narration by William Holden, it tells the story of how he tried to hide from a couple of mobsters who were chasing him and accidentally stumbled across the home of former silent movie star Norma Desmond (perfectly played by Gloria Swanson). Desmond has a huge ego and believes that everyone is still in love with her films and wants her to make a comeback. As Holden is paid to write a screenplay for her, the film's tragic story begins to unfold. The story doesn't matter to this film's greatness. It's the way everything about this movie was done that makes it a timeless, excellent movie. It's some of the best dialogue you will ever hear. See the film once and you'll remember Norma Desmond forever. She is a perfect character that gives brilliant acting to every scene. For example, when Holden first recognizes her, he exclaims that she is Norma Desmond, the silent movie star who used to be big, to which she responds, in my favorite line of the film, ""I am big, it's the pictures that got small!"" I don't think there was a more brilliant way she could have said this. Swanson was completely robbed for Best Actress by Judy Holliday for ""Born Yesterday."" You will not see a film this good anymore. I can't recommend it enough. If it seems too strange, keep watching anyway, and watch a second time if necessary. Absolutely perfect.",

Joe agrees to review a terrible script that the diva is writing, dreaming of a sensational return to the set. The atmosphere of the house is black, dark, almost deadly. The diva projects continually her old movies, guests are mummies, this fact proves that she is obsessed with herself and her career. Relevant figure is the domestic Von Mayerling (Stroheim), he is also the first husband of Norma. She ends up falling in love of the young man, but Joe is in love with his colleague Olson. Gillis for a while accepts the situation but then he starts to be worried and afraid. But Norma, now mad and out of her mind, shoots him while he is leaving. Man falls into the pool, a symbol of the things he had so desired. Norma became mad because she doesn't want to accept the fact that she is not a star anymore, she doesn't want to accept that she is old and not anymore young and beautiful: during the film she tries to look younger thanks to clamorous long beauty treatments; she doesn't want to open her eyes and she doesn't want to see the truth. The story is told by Gillis, who is already dead, in the third person in a long flashback. Everything in the film is dusty, old, broken and decadent.

It starts off with a film noir style introduction that feels slightly forced, but the movie has a self-awareness about it that doesn't try to make fun of movies as much as it pokes fun at how silent films had become extinct and how movie making had changed. The movie quickly switches genres like Zombieland. One scene is straight out of film noir; another scene is out of a screwball comedy. It is easy to see how the movie comes together after seeing the first scene, but it gets increasingly interesting and unpredictable until the final moment when you really can see how everything happens. The final scene feels like a glorious send off with lighting present everywhere showing how much technology is necessary for a glossy scene of glamor.

I watched this movie for the first time ever today, 70 years after it was released, and it's still an incredibly gripping and entertaining movie, with complex characters, constantly making morally ambiguous decisions. The film is about a struggling writer who happens upon a manipulative, egocentric, middle-aged silent era movie star, who can't let go of the golden age of the past. I've heard some people call this a criticism of Hollywood, but I don't think that's right, at least not to the extent of saying that the film is primarily about that. I think it's about not being able to let go of the past, as Joe says to Norma at the end of the film ""There's nothing wrong with being 50, as long as you're not trying to be 25.""

What makes this film interesting is the story-within-story of the decline of the silent movie actor juxtaposed against a silent era actress acting as the silent actress in decline. The cast is full of silent actors, including Norma, and directors. Even the gossip at the end of the movie was a actor-turned-gossip in truth. Perhaps it had been a stretch for Mrs. Swanson to accept this role. I can't imagine that very many silent-era actors enjoyed the advent of 'talkies'.

The only thing wrong with this film is that at some points due to the amazing writing it seems scripted. At some points the things that the characters are saying just seem so impossible to make on the spot. Gloria Swansons acting in the film was really the heart of it and was outstanding.

There have been other films about this including Singin' in the Rain (1952) directed by Donen and Kelly. This being the part of the plot doesn't seem like it would make it a classic.

439,22 July 2020,lukecon-63436,10, One of Billy Wilder's directorial gems,"This film surely deserves the credit it gets. Billy Wilder effectively creates darkly comedic dialogue in its script. The dialogue is witty, and while dark, helps shed some humor in the midst of a dark situation--this adds to the brilliance of the dialogue.
The characters are brilliantly crafted and developed, as we understand our main characters and their motivations. We understand the perspective of our two major characters, played by William Holden and Gloria Swanson. We know more about their characteristics and their goals/motivations through their dialogue and actions.
Not only is the script great, the acting is very good. Gloria Swanson creepily plays her character with a dark but brilliant delivery of dialogue, adding to the dark atmosphere of the film. William Holden also delivers his lines just as well as Swanson does.
The production design is also very fitting for the dark and creepy atmosphere of the film--the design/decoration of sets such as the house of Norma Desmond--helps add to the frightening/dark mood of the film.

Norma Desmond played by Gloria Swanson was brilliant.
William Holden as Joe Gillis was quite charming however I feel it would have been better if the chemistry between Betty Schaefer played by Nancy Olson and Joe was showed a little more. The intimacy between them would've perfectly balanced the unwillingness of Joe to give in to the wishes of Norma.

The inclusion of references to other film stars and film makers also brought a realistic feel to it. Their relationship somehow made me uncomfortable, I'm not sure if it was their age difference or because she was so needy and controlling of him. It did seem he had some feeling for her, because he went back after he found out that she tried to kill herself. That last scene was very powerful with the lights and the crowd, like her swansong. A very impressive use of lighting as well.",

Joe Gillis is the narrator of the story he is also a man that just came upon her house when his car broke down. he was a writer for movie. she would help pay him to do look over her story to see if it was any good and to edit but what she really want him for was to stay with her forever. it is a Drama about a old crazy actress that just wants a companionship. the movie is a little slow but then it picks up,
469,12 April 2010,mammigirl,7, Sunset Blvd,I thought this movie was pretty good. I like how it shows how Hollywood can affect a person and how being in the spotlight can consume their life. Norma Desmond played by Gloria Swanson is a perfect example. In this movie she is living in the past to when she was really famous. A man by the name of Joe Gillis ends up at her house and gets forced to look at her screen play. Norma seems like she has some kind of mental problem and that shes not all there. If Joe tries and goes somewhere and shes not with him she acts like she is gonna kill herself. At the end of the movie he tries and leaves but as he walks out she shoots him. It doesn't even phase her. When the cops come she thinks that they are their to shoot her movie. So we see the camera focus on her as she is coming down the stairs. She doesn't even know that they are their to take her away that's how messed up she is. She is to focused on being in the spotlight.,

474,5 August 2020,sarathda,8, Billy Wilder masterpiece,"There is a lot to love about this movie, which is loaded with great performances, and intersects film noir with fading Hollywood stardom. It grabs us from the start with police called to the scene of a mansion with a body floating in its pool, and as we listen to a deadpan narrator. Director Billy Wilder gives us the first of what will be many great shots, this one from what appears to be the bottom of the pool, with policemen in the background standing over the body. The film then flashes back to a young writer (William Holden), down on his luck and pressured by repo men, trying to figure out a way to sell his work or borrow some money. He pulls into the driveway of a mansion by chance, and finds himself slowly entangled in another trap, that of an aging Hollywood star (Gloria Swanson). The feel is eerie from the start, as she seeks funeral arrangements for her pet chimp, lives in boundless ostentation, and has a single companion, her solemn servant (Erich von Stroheim) who plays an organ that otherwise wheezes drearily when the wind blows through it. While her pool and tennis courts have fallen into ruin, she lives in the past, surrounded by her own photographs and watching her own old movies. Out of what he feels to be necessity, he begins working for her and living with her, hating every moment. Gloria Swanson, who was 51, turns in an outstanding performance, and has several fantastic scenes. The one where she and Holden sit in the dark with the projector light going through smoke is brilliant, and one of my favorites. Another is him dancing with her on the floor that she says Valentino had danced on, surrounded by an orchestra and expecting other guests, only to realize there will be none. The one where she imitates Charlie Chaplin, complete with a little tramp outfit, is truly special. Wilder is excellent at gradually revealing just how far gone she is. It was a nice touch of his to include silent movie stars as her bridge companions in a small scene, including Buster Keaton, and to see Cecil B. DeMille on the set at Paramount was fantastic. We see both her delusion of still being an important star as she rolls up to the gate house in her expensive old car (an Isotta-Fraschini), and yet we also see her past stardom recognized by one of the gate keepers, and then people on the set when they realize she's there. It's a very touching moment. Things get more complicated when Holden begins working with the fiancé (Nancy Olson) of his affable friend (Jack Webb, soon to be better known for Dragnet). Not all of the scenes revolve around Swanson, and the one where Holden and Olson play act a romantic scene at a party is intelligent, funny, and utterly charming. The film gives us a behind the scenes look at Hollywood - brainstorming over scripts, the writing process, the vanity of those in the limelight, and the opulence. Swanson gets a little over the top at times especially towards the end, but the film feels both sadly true, and yet also fantastical, with her mansion other-worldly and not unlike that of the one Miss Havisham has in 'Great Expectations', as Holden observes early on. With such a setting and those poignant overtones, and having excellent direction, cinematography, script, and cast, it's hard to go wrong with this one.",
475,25 November 2009,b-mooney,8, The twilight zone,I give this film a lot of credit for its creativity with respect to the storyline. I felt like it was an episode from the twilight zone because Gloria Swanson was so detached from reality. I liked the narration being from the point of view of the murdered man in flashback style. I thought this was unique. A lot of the story took place in the mansion of Gloria and I thought that the design did a good job of portraying her insanity. She had tons of pictures of herself and it was a good portrayal of her self-absorbed personality with respect to her former acting career. I liked the idea that there were a lot of characters in the film that were played by actual people who worked during the silent film era. It really contributed to the verisimilitude of the film. The last scene was classic and I will never forget it. The only way they could safely get her out of the house was by creating the image that she was acting in a film. Brilliant.,
476,16 February 2015,chrisunderscoreroberts,6, Great film considering when it was made; taking account it was during the hays code and the year it was made (1950),"I thought that Sunset Blvd. was very intriguing the way it was filmed and the was it was scripted. Personally, ""film noir style"" doesn't appeal to me very much but the character development and plot made it worth the while. Norma's crazy, huge ego minded personality set in the rustic mansion contrasted with Joe's low income, easily persuaded (by money) character along with his romance with Betty sustained my interest for sure. The film makers really hyperbolized each of the characters most prominent traits, such as Normas batty behavior and Betty's soft, aspiring personality. I think this type of scripting brought the film to life and made up for the lack of colour. (of course, colour wasn't possible at the time) What added to the film was the symbolism throughout, and the irony of Norma being played by Gloria Swanson, previous silent film star. Overall, I found the film was very well rounded in the sense that it wasn't just a love story, but a clever, witty, dark, and emotionally touching piece made in a time where this was very hard to find.",

After gradually developing Norma's character, the plot took off and my enthusiasm for the film rose exponentially.

She is lonely and wants him to stay with her to keep her company, he is in need of money and she is rich and supplies him with all of this fancy stuff. He eventually gets sick of her buying him things, so he tries to leave. When he is trying to leave she goes crazy and says that she will kill herself if he doesn't stay.

Unfortunately for Swanson, All About Eve was released in the same year, so Swanson and Davis cancelled each other out and Judy Holliday stole the Oscar for Born Yesterday, one of the All-time Oscar travesties.  Swanson puts it all out there for us in this film, and we all get to just eat it up.

496,5 September 2006,sevisan,7, High camp.,"Billy Wilder always liked the obvious and easy things. For instance, Jack Lemon is the ""middle American everyman"", Marilyn is the dumb girl, Stanwyck is the blonde wicked vamp, Stroheim is ""one of the three grands directors of the silent era"", Swanson disguised as Chaplin, etc. His films are often overwritten (lines like ""next time I'll write ""The naked and the dead"", ""who wants to see a film about the civil war?"", etc.). ""Sunset Boulevard"" is a typical Wilder film, full of obvious and overblown things like that, but is a film that it gets better as the decades pass by, I don't know exactly the reason. It is a film that is ""so bad that is very good"". Perhaps in ten years, another awful ""wilderiana"" as ""The big carnival"" (almost worse than SBoulevard) will be also redeemed by its campy flavor.",
497,15 October 2020,winstonc-86282,9, Did a good job at being unsettling,"Sunset Boulevard had me internally yelling the entire way ""What are you doing?!"". I guess it was extremely unsettling to me to see Gillis becoming dependent on the riches of such a painfully fragile yet egotistical woman. To say the least, it was just uncomfortable to observe the path that Gillis was taking himself through - he had a much more promising future working with Schaffer. Yes, he may have been close to drowning in Desmond's wealth, and could (maybe) have a shot at potentially enhancing her mediocre scripts to fit the likings of the people at Paramount, thus earning him a (very) dependant living. But did he really want that? I don't particularly think so. I feel like he was almost accepting his ""fate"" with a sort of resentment. Because he felt like he didn't really have a choice, because he thought he had a shot with giving her reputation a face lift. Eventually I'm pretty sure he started to realize that he couldn't stay with this lady anymore, that he needed to turn his life around and go back, find his own friends his own age, working with people his own age.
I think Schaffer alluded to many opportunities and chances Gillis could take to work with her, such as when Gillis had enough of Desmond and decided back to his friend Green to inquire on whether or not Green could give him a few nights at his place. Then he was subsequently informed by Schaefer that she believed one of his scripts had potential - and was almost abruptly turned down in return when he declined. Or when Mayerling divulged to him the nearly unfathomable fact that it was in fact he who was really writing and sending the fan mail to Desmond. Because clearly no one found much taste in her work anymore. And her fame was vanishing. Fast.
I feel like the entire time he was almost battling an inner doubt within him - to find wealth and work with a seemingly crazed older lady with a fragile ego, or sign a deal with Schaffer who comprehended that his work had potential. I feel like he was in a way not really sure what he was getting himself into in the first place - he was $300 in debt, no one would lend him anything, and he started to develop mutual relations with this old woman. The ending was almost scary to me. He completely lost his chances with Schaffer. It was like his double life was seriously messing with his thinking too. The second Desmond revealed the firearm, I was 99.9% sure he wasn't leaving the estate alive (the 0.01% I was reserving for a miracle. I mean, you never know with this woman who seemed dazed to the point of becoming schizophrenic-like at the final ending shot). Somehow when she was following him with the gun I still hadn't connected the dots to the shot at the start with the dead body in the pool. But then, yes - it all made sense in a landslide.
Overall, if the film was meant to be perceived as unsatisfying/settling to their primary audiences, well it worked for me.",

This was due to it portrayal of Hollywood; not old the actors and actresses but of what goes on behind the scenes. The scandals and things that get swept under the rug. It was a real slap in the face for the many that think of Hollywood as glamorous and ideal.

Joe's narration, opening the film with the end of the film, the set design of Norma's house, the superb cinematography and most of all Gloria Swanson. This is the only film I have ever seen of hers and she is so amazing. The character of Norma Desmond is one of a somewhat forgotten actress of the silent era who believes it is time for her great comeback to the silver screen. There is one problem though, she is a loon. Outright over the top whack job who obsesses on her career. Swamson is over the top. Very believable at times and as well, very laughable. There is a movie out there called The Forbidden Zone from early 1980's. The actress Susan Tyrell portrays a character very similar to the Desmond role, even in her facial expressions.

Joe Gillis, played by William Holden, is our alienated main character who gets caught up in debt with his lenders. Joe finds reprieve from his debtors and his Hollywood apartment when he comes across a deserted mansion belonging to silent film star Norma Desmond, played by Gloria Swanson. Swanson's performance in a word is chilling. Her delivery is purposely melodramatic to play off of her silent film techniques and her outdated conception of films. Her career is essentially dead and Joe's arrival provides an opportunity for her revival. Norma is one of film noir's most famous femme fatales, considering her obsession with Joe causes her to shoot him in the end. In the aftermath, Norma's delusions about her resurgence in film causes her to think the reporters crowding her estate are cameramen filming a scene for a new film. Norma's delusional perceptions of her own reality lead to her own demise and Joe's faith in her delusions led to his demise. The wisest character is undoubtedly Max, Norma's servant who keeps her satisfied by fueling the delusions and preserving her delicate feelings. Overall, this is a must watch film for any movie lover.

Once she heard ""cameras"" she lit up. She was so bizarre, ""What is the scence"", ""Where am I""? Oscar material! She was out of her mind and I loved it!!

516,18 October 2019,starry-2,10," Classic atmospheric daring story of being washed up, obsession and Hollywood of the 50s","A dynamite surreal movie that got made within the usual traditional constraints of the Hollywood studio system. It's the story of a struggling screenwriter who by chance befriends an aging forgotten (and struggling) actress who is desperate for attention, a mate (and work) whilst living in almost complete isolation.
The visual atmosphere is dark, ambient and beautifully stale- incredible ...and the psychiatric narcissistic madness acted out by the main actress is fully believable. It's part mystery, part psychology a bit horror and full on art. It's full of iconic memorable lines as well. This is a must have classic dark film that is comfortably punishing to its main characters and an accurate depiction of what more than often eventually happens to those in the movie business. By the way, this is one of director David Lynch's (Mulholland drive, blue velvet, eraserhead) favourite films and has cited it as a major influence upon his work (I.e. sunset Blvd <==> Mulholland drive).",

And the film goes on it shifts to the begging of the whole story narrated by Joe. As the story goes on its events are predictable and are anti-realistic. Making the movie ""uncomfortable"", Overall I think these movies are not ""real movies"" in my opinion. What I mean about that is they are not realistic, realistic as in it could happen in the real world. And those series of events would very unlikely happen in the real world.",

The plot works on various levels with different interpretations and an actual focused theme. It's not just a love story, it's an honest Hollywood depiction, it's a meditation on fame and time. Good work there! The movie, though, presents some important flaws. Most relevant the off- voice, which was distracting at the beginning and honestly very on-the- nose sometimes, not centered in giving feedback or highlighting a concrete point, but rather there as a lazy job on the director's part. Swanson's performance (what an appropriate name!) is borderline unwatchable by the way.",

524,11 April 2010,aeboynton,7, Sunset Blvd.,"Norma Desmend, played by Gloria Swanson did an amazing job at portraying a mentally imbalanced person who dreams of returning to her previous life as a silent movie star. Joe gills, played by William Holden seems to be disconnected to Norma in that he lives with her and pretends to be there to write a movie script in which she is the star. The themes in this movie are still relevant issues today and that's one of the reasons I believe that this movie is considered timeless. Norma still yearns for the attention that being a movie star brings. She is holding onto her past life and therefore cannot move forward in any other aspect of her being. The movie did make me laugh in parts, at times because of Norma's disillusionment however at the end I just felt sorry for her. Like many people in Hollywood today, their acting careers fizzle out at a certain age unless they reinvent themselves significantly. This often is the case with child stars that then turn to acquire psychological issues or addictions to drugs or alcohol. I also think it is quit sad that her butler and ex husband still lives with her because he loves her. It seems like in this each character is not living but existing in their life. I think it would add a greater dimension to the film if the audience knew a bit more about max as her ex husband and the history of them.",
525,26 November 2017,jolieschu,10," Wonderful, dazing movie with a lot to say",This is a wonderful movie. I say this for a few reasons; the different characters you meet during your time watching each seem to have things to say about the state of Hollywood at the time. Although some of the commentary could carry over into criticisms of the same Hollywood today. I would even argue that some of the things the main actress expresses from the beginning to the end: could speak to some of the affects of Hollywood on child actors. ,

Then goes on to tell the story of the time leading up to his death when he stayed with an older famous actress from the silent era. The movie uses lots of narration so we get to hear what the main character is thinking constantly, this works really well as they use this in comedic ways constantly. It is ultimately a tragic story of an actress who is dying to make a comeback after 20 plus years away from the film industry. The story was so engaging i honestly forgot that the main character had been murdered in the beginning, so it really brought the story full circle when we see his downfall.",

Gloria Swanson's wide-eyed facial expressions held such intensity that you could feel the crazy as if it were right next to you. The way the film is shot intensifies this mood even more: black and white that emits a powerful, severe feeling. I found the narration to be extremely effective; I felt very involved in the story as an audience member. All of the characters' (Max, Norma, Joe especially) psychological struggles were very fascinating to follow as well. The complexity hiding beneath the surface in this film is captivating.",

A film made about a starlet from a dead era, but the movies she starred in hadn't even been cold in the ground yet! The bold, brash lines, and of course, the undeniably dynamic and purely iconic acting of Gloria Swanson. This is a film where the supposed main character, in this case Joe Gillis, is just a backdrop, a segue into the true protagonist and star of the show, Norma Desmond. The lighting to show mood and tone, the snappy and emotional dialogue. Not many movies like Sunset Boulevard are both a hit when they come out and a classic more than 50 years after, but this film nails it on the head.",

531,11 May 2018,pdortic,9, Past the usual hollywood glam,This is a movie that shattered the pure image of classic Hollywood. It takes on the fact of their ideal image of beauty and the effect on women when they no longer fit that standard. The film follows a start that has fallen from her golden thrown and her deep seated struggles when all she has ever known is gone. To further complicate this there is of course relationship drama. This is a great movie to start off the 1950's and encompasses a classic film noir.,

The ending was a complete surprise to me, including the last line, ""All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up."" Huge iconic quote and I had no idea it was from this movie. The lighting was amazing and was more fun than usual in this movie because of the content. The audience could see some of the lighting being used to ""film"".

537,9 April 2020,ldanv,9, A FASCINATING CHARACTER STUDY,"This film is a fascinating character study, a classic example of what happens when a delusional actress comes to believe her own publicity. The picture is well-written, superbly cast and acted, and moves at an excellent pace, with no unnecessary scenes.
The backstory of this film is almost as fascinating as the picture itself, and is the subject of a book, available from amazon. The male lead was originally offered to Montgomery Clift, who turned it down - some say because of his involvement with middle-aged torch singer Libby Holman, who told him to reject the script. Perhaps it was just too close to home. (The life of Libby Holman would itself make a fascinating film)
According to rumor the picture was actually based on the life of Corinne Griffith, one of the most beautiful women in silent pictures, who was also a real estate expert. When Norma Desmond states ""I own three blocks downtown,"" that was Corinne speaking - she did own three blocks in Beverly Hills.
Wilder and Brackett had been working on the script for some years when it finally jelled. The picture contains some famous lines that have become part of our folklore, such as ""I'm ready for my closeup."" I would recommend it to any student of the cinema, or anyone who is just a movie fan.",

It follows a struggling screenwriter and ends up in the hands of Norma Desmond, the classic femme fatale of film-noir. This movie takes a lot of risks and that's what makes it a very good movie. Many romance movies eventually end with the main guy getting the girl and they walk off the sunset. But this movie does not do that, it is very dark and it had to be work. The way it shows Hollywood as a dark place, especially during this time, by using actor or actress for a long time and then they just throw them away like an antique. It also shows that people who work in Hollywood aren't perfect people, everyone looks up to Hollywood like its a glamorous place, but the main character is trying to get away from paying his car bills and then, he also seduces a female screenwriter after she says that she is engaged. If the movie had ended with him going with Betty in the end, it would have gone against the purpose of the movie, and probably not make it a film milestone that it is today.",

542,7 April 2010,Molly04,9, Sunset Blvd Review,"This extremely dramatic film noir was surprisingly a movie that I liked. Although at first glance, I admit I assumed it to be over the top or annoying perhaps but I was wrong, Gloria Swanson (famous silent film actress) stepped out of her silent film career to play this more well known role of her career. Surprisingly enough, this film is about Hollywood in the 1950's. William Hollden is a somewhat struggling film writer who ends up meeting Norma (Swanson). The pair make for a humorous yet strange pair throughout the entire film. The black and white film itself creates for an even more intense and certainly dramatic mood, it especially helps to atmosphere of the movie when scenes take place in Norma's gloomy old mansion. Narration throughout the film is in first person from Holden's point of view. The entire thing is a sort of- flashback, as most noirs are. Camera tricks such as fading in and out are used quite often in the film to add to dramatic effect as well. Of course the ending was my favorite part where Norma stares blankly at the screen and says "" Mr. DeVille- i'm ready for my close up."" I really liked this film a lot. It was visually and emotionally enticing.",

It tells the story it portrays in a creepy, gruesome manner which makes it that much more engaging. Honestly, if Joe left with Betty, I think I would've been slightly more satisfied with the ending even if it is cliche. The happier endings may be less exciting and interesting, but happier endings are better for peace of mind. That being said, I did enjoy the shock of the ending. They showed Norma's true psychotic break when she shot Joe and was still on about being a star. I also really enjoyed Joe narrating the whole thing even after he was dead, because I often wonder about the characters and what they think after their death. Overall great movie, just a little too slow-paced for me.",
547,17 January 2019,altheas-35492,8, A Movie That Makes You Feel for The Characters,"This movie has aged very well. The plot was strong and the mood the characters gave off really made you feel for them and want them to succeed. Joe, specifically, made you root for him throughout the movie. After his first encounter with Norma you realized that she would trap him and he would be unable to escape the toxic realationship. After he met Betty, you really wanted them to run off together and for Joe to escape his problems at home with Norma. In the end, Joe is shot by Norma and it was his own fault. He had the opportunity to leave and he missed it. He allowed his feeling to overtake his mind and he was unable to think properly because he was trying to do what was best for Norma.
The mood of the movie would have concluded happy had Joe left with Betty when he had the chance. Staying to help Norma changed how you felt about Joe and gave the film a dark mood.",

Although it was tough at times to follow all the dialogue being thrown at you the acting in it was superb. It wasn't a cliche film with a happy ending but it the film drew you in right from the start knowing it was going to end badly. The film was gripping from start to finish. The characters were hard to really like other than Betty Schaefer but that was a huge pull in when Betty was pleading with Joe near the end of the film to come with her and drop the life he had with Norma. You want him to go so badly just for you to be let down knowing what is coming right from the start of the film. This movie despite being older has kept it's kick.,

You could say this film was the beginning of a much darker time for film, and the first time people on the the audience could see that Hollywood was not all good and shiny as they had thought before. While this film might seem exaggerated in the character of Norma Desmond, who becomes literally mad with the idea of her past fame, there is truth in her character.

552,16 April 2020,ryanvaine,7, another hollywood classic,"Foe my ""History of American Cinema"" class, I had to watch a movie under the genre of film noir. The movie I chose to watch was, ""Sunset Blvd.,"" directed by Bill Wilder and released to the public in 1950. Film noir movies have an overall mood of pessimism, fatalism, or menace. I think this film had a strong mood of pessimism. This film had a very cynical view of Hollywood(especially during the 1950's), the plot line's message was how Hollywood makes people famous, then dumps them when they are no longer needed. The script is very clean, clever, and witty. There were a variety of camera angels, with clean transitions. I also enjoyed the element of romance throughout the film. The actors really embraced their characters and brought the script to life and made you feel emotional throughout the movie, because it seemed so realistic, and like these were real people going through hard times. The movie was shot beautifully in black and white, and gave off a very gloomy vibe. I really enjoyed this film and think it deserves all the success, because it is an interesting movie and makes you feel emotional involved.

And ""Sunset Boulevard"" is his best film. Not of him, in fact, but of all time. It's a disgrace that he has lost the Academy Award for ""All About Eve"" - another great movie - but this became another of the countless injustices of the Oscar's history. There is not any other movie director that can show a filmopgrafhy as the one Billy Wilder. The 40's and specially the 50's was a example of masterpieces, one after another. Of course, I admit that he didn't maintain the same level after this time. ""The Apartment"" was its last great movie, in spite of him to have made great works after this, as the overlooked ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"" and ""Fedora"" - almost a ""Sunset Boulevard"" re-make. But ""Sunset Boulevard"", reviews today, it stays with its qualities, witty, intelligence, cynicism.

Gloria Swanson was NOTHING like Norma Desmond in real life. At the time she was offered the role, she was very busy (thank you very much) in New York with, among other things, pioneering early live television. She had a very busy family and social life, and wasn't that keen on returning to California and the silver screen. She was, however, very intrigued with the script, and was talked into it by Wilder. When she got to the coast and began to make contact with some of her old friends from the silent days, she was very disturbed and a little freaked out to discover that there were indeed many ""Norma"" cases hidden in the Bel Air hills. She was shocked to find many of her old acquaintances were stuck in the past, where as she had moved on and never looked back. She then actively sought out these people and began studying them, incorporating parts of each of them into her portrayal of Norma Desmond.",

569,15 August 2015,mattyankster10,9, Outstanding script along with excellent acting,"Before I watched Sunset Blvd I knew it was an old 1950's classic in black and white, and I was slightly reluctant to put it on only because I was feeling a bit tired and wasn't sure if I was in the mood for something that required deep attention. But I was wrong, Sunset Blvd was actually a very easy to watch movie, it did not have an overly complicated plot. As soon as the movie began my eyes were glued to the television and my brain easily absorbed every single detail of the plot. What I also liked about it was that they kept it to a nice length, only 1 hour 50 minutes long. A similar film that I recently watched is All About Eve, which ran for 2 hours and 20 minutes, I felt that was a bit too long and they dragged out much longer than they should have. Sunset Blvd went by at a much more pleasant pace. In other words there was never a moment in which I zoned out. ",
570,15 October 2020,bullenjessica,8, Ghosts of The Past,"Sunset Boulevard was an extraordinary film that portrays the afterlife of has-been silent film actress, Norma Desmon, (portrayed by Gloria Swanson; a silent film actress herself) from the perspective of a struggling film writer, Joe Gillis ( portrayed by William Holden). The concept of the film was very unique and set the stage for well-known films such as Pulp Fiction. The film starts at what is actually the end of the film, with a dead man floating face down in a pool. I really like it when films do this because it gives you a taste of what's going to happen. It leaves you wondering.",

572,5 February 2015,arpia97,8, Fascinating!,"I actually didn't expect much from this movie when I started watching it. But this movie surprised me with its intense plot, and the allusions all over the movie. It used symbolic representation to the limit, and the characters all seemed original- I liked how all of these characters had individuality and how these characters kind of changed over time as the movie went on, as a result of inner and outer conflict. I also liked the complex plot of the movie, as well as how the story untied over time. The introduction had a pretty strong impression, and getting to know the behind story of it was very interesting for me. I thought using the imagery of old and young throughout the plot had a great influence in the progress of the story, both in the characters and the plot. Overall, I was very satisfied with this film. I thought the storyline was impressive- ahead of its time, and all the characters' acting was impressive.",

574,8 July 2020,pedrometzker,10, One of the best.,"I pressed play hoping for a comedy. I was completely wrong, but, at the end, it pleased me a lot. You can call this one the Hollywood horror story if you want. It brings a cynical look of Hollywood, talking about how writers are seen inside and outside the industry and the toxic star machine. Sunset Boulevard is one of the best noir movies out there. Has an amazing cast of characters, an astonishing performance by Gloria Swanson as the scary and crazy Norma Desmond, a great score, memorable scenes and dialogues and exceptional writing and directing by Billy Wilder.",
575,9 May 2018,jessicaa-26438,9, Wow!,"Going into this film I wasn't sure how I'd like it, but after watching ten minutes of it I knew I was hooked. William Holden's naturalistic performance was phenomenal, and it's one of the best movies about Hollywood especially during it's time period. The film shows the contrast between old Hollywood and the up rise of the new hollywood, especially when they discuss Gloria Swanson's characters career fading. Overall this film was truly amazing, and having that film-noir aspect to it just makes it ten times better. I can definatly see why a lot of people consider this a classic.",

577,16 January 2019,willab-04386,7, Interesting Film,"I've heard the name Sunset Boulevard repeatedly over my life, but I hadn't seen it until now. Since I'd heard it heralded as a classic, but didn't know much about it, I was excited to see it, and it was an interesting film to finally watch. However, I found it a little difficult to get invested in the film since neither of the main characters seemed particularly sympathetic to me. This made some scenes feel dull or unappealing to watch because I didn't really care what happened to the characters. That being said, most scenes were still interesting, and it was still fun to see a ""classic"" old film.",
578,12 January 2019,mati_dipietro,9, Brilliant,"Sunset boulevard was one of the most intricate movies that I have ever seen. It was brilliant and it showed flawed characters and how making certain types of choices reflects on how your life is going to be.
I didn't sympathize with any of the characters, I only had a slight preference for Betty, which was innocent, but too naive for my personal taste. I absolutely loved the expressiveness of Gloria Swanson (but since she was a famous silent movie actress I couldn't expect less than that). I am happy with the final: him not leaving when Betty asks him so is what males this movie ""realistic"".
We all hope love to triumph, justice to be made and the manipulators to lose, but in my opinion this movie wouldn't have been a classic if Joe had left with Betty. He made too many mistakes and lost his chances of saving himself, but instead he always preferred to keep living the way he was. At the end, his destiny was already sealed and deep down he knew what was gonna eventually happen.
Great movie, I enjoyed watching it and I recommend to watch it",

All other older movies I had seen had either been silent films, which significantly limits the depth of the story, or slapstick comedies which I am not the biggest fan of. surprisingly, it was a great story told in an interesting way. I loved it. This film must be one of the earlier examples of a movie starting from the ending scene, and then going back, slowly explaining how the story gets there. This movie definitely popularized this style of storytelling and set the stage for many movies to come.",
581,14 October 2020,jdmelhado,10, Sunset Blvd. Review by Juan,"Sunset Blvd is an amazing film, with an incredible plot. This film teaches you so much about the influence fame can affect a person. This film has such an impact on the viewer. This film really keeps the viewer wanting to know what happens next. The plot twists are incredible and keeps you intrigued every second of the film. There wasn't a moment where i lost interest or didn't want to keep watching. Sunset Blvd is definitely a film because of the way it teaches you about the film industry back then and how people were treated. This film does a great job on showing how money isn't everything in life because of how William Holden lied to Norma Desmond about his life and who he was and his income. He did all this just for money and was very happy and thought all his problems had gone away but later in the movie he would find himself bored and unhappy even though he was very rich and had no financial problems. He then had an affair and was offered any amount of money but he left without any valuables or money and just wanted to go back to his old job and not be rich but be happy.",
582,14 October 2020,lucaj-33832,8, A Lovely Film Noir,"I'm new to ""film noirs"". While i've most definitely seen a few, and liked them, I never knew it was a whole genre of movies. Sunset Blvd is one of the most classic film noirs as it was made in the 50's, and film noirs became popular only a few years prior (40s.) This movie really influenced all of film for the following years. I enjoyed this movie, but the backstory to it and all the little random things I learned about it while reading articles made me like it even more. For example, one of the main characters Norma Desmond is played by Gloria Swanson who herself is a very well known silent film actress. It was her come back into the film word after many years and plenty movie opportunities offered to her. Knowing things like that about the movie (there are much more) make me more interested and impressed by the film.",

585,27 April 2023,lanabuset,6, Sunset Blvd,"In the beginning of the film/movie betty had no idea what was going on between Joe and Norma, then as the film or movie gets to the scene of Joe helping Betty he then lies to her saying nothing about the relationship he has with Norma, keeping it a secret until that's when Norma takes things into her own hands when she finds out about betty. Betty ends up coming to the house after Joe asks her to come meanwhile he starts to change the subject. Betty had enough with the lies and offers Joe this opportunity to leave with her away from Normas house, he then refuses the offer Leaving him wondering whether he should have taken that offer. Being in Joes situation would have been hard to leave a women like Norma Desmond she is this person who could have been mentally ill and made her do the things she has done like murder or hiring a butler that's one of her ex husbands. What really ever happened to those other two husbands, and what made Norma Desmond have a illness. The differences between Betty and Norma is that Betty is this young female that's trying the best she can to help herself and her career to become a successful Writer Norma on the other hand is this women who's finished being the big star and is now in her own little world not caring about the people around her, while also being stuck on the past of her career. The scenes that highlight this would be when Norma keeps watching herself on the screen with Joe in her living room, another would be Betty asks Joe when he's in her office to talk to her if he could help with a book she was writing. Overall I think this would count as a film and not a movie. What's interesting about this film is that it starts off with a murder in the beginning with the guy who's dead who explains the story behind how he dies. Many other movies or films I could say that would have had that type of beginning in them, makes you really hooked into knowing about what's about to happen next in the story. This film leaves me with a lot of questions that never got answered.",
586,24 May 2023,rlrichter,6, Cruel critique of its own industry,"The film's structure is quite unique as it starts with the ending scene of the main character lying dead in the pool. Not only is it an element of foreshadowing, it basically spoilers the whole movie. Of course, it makes you curious about the rest of the movie and how it got to this point, but I personally didn't like it because later I could already tell that things wouldn't work out for Joe and that made it harder to root for him. Another thing that was unique about the structure was the use of a narrator. It was Joe's voice talking about the events and giving us a little insight into his thoughts. That reminded me so much of how books are structured that I googled if the movie was based on a book (which it isn't). I think what was lacking for me with this movie was my connection to the characters. I couldn't understand a lot of their actions (for example why Joe stayed for that long, why Max stayed with Norma) and they were just not likable to me. I didn't really care about what would happen to them. For me, the only interesting characteristic was how different the two women in Joe's life were; they were basically opposites of each other. Betty is this young, sweet and innocent girl who is full of ideas and still has her whole career in front of her. She has realized that ""being behind the stage is just as good"" as being on it, while Norma craves for the spotlight and would never settle for anything other than being the main actress. Betty is looking into the future and Norma is stuck in the past, obviously traumatized by how she was treated by the movie industry. Her career is already over, but she keeps on holding on to her dreams of yesterday. Her obsession with her old self and her delusion about her career are portrayed as the result of how her directors pushed her to the side after she reached a certain age and didn't fit the beauty standard anymore. By that, the movie is critiquing its own industry and how actors are treated in it. I think it has an important message and a good movie, but it didn't really resonate with me.",
587,27 April 2023,devinhawman,6, More complex than it seems on the surface,"Throughout film and literary history, women have often been depicted as either a damsel in need of saving or as a witch in need of controlling, and although Sunset Boulevard seems- at first- to fall into this trap, it quickly dismisses this theory. Nora Desmond can be seen by the audience as a controlling vindictive woman, but that is simply the surface of her character. Yes, she does display controlling and even sometimes abusive behavior towards Joe, particularly crying and screaming to make him feel bad whenever he does something she disapproves of, but she also has complex reasons for the way she is. We learn that she was brought into stardom at 16, and became a gigantic star, only to be cast aside and forgotten once she couldn't cut it in ""talkies."" She is an archetype of someone who was promised everything and had it all taken from her overnight. This is contrasted with the character of Betty, who dreams of writing scripts for movies. She was never promised success in the industry, working herself up the studio ladder. Betty never expected much from the world, no grand life in the lights of Hollywood, no romantic love story with Joe; she asks him for one, but she never expects it, and when he tells her he can't give it to her, she accepts this. Perhaps if she had expected more, she would have forced Joe to go with her then, and he would have survived.",

It works to expose how toxic Hollywood's star system is presented through both the industry's progression and the star's challenges of moving from silent to voice films. The film demonstrates how the celebrity image is temporary. Sunset Boulevard depends upon photographic mood for much of its dramatic effect. This film started with the ending which was really interesting. It builds suspense and makes the audience wonder what happened. It was excellent use of foreshadowing. It was also narrated throughout the entire film.",
590,17 May 2023,anthonys-95655,7, What about the monkey?,"Sunset Boulevard is an interesting film set in early 50s Hollywood, with a couple issues. This is obviously an older movie so it had slower pacing, but it didn't detract from the film that much. Despite it's age it still had a strong plot line but unfortunately it was partially ruined by them spoiling the ending right at the beginning of the film. I don't like it when films do this, and in this case it's pretty easy to deduce what will happen at the end. This ended up taking a lot of the surprise out of what could have been a shocking ending. As for the plot itself, it follows an out of luck writer who by chance happens upon what is paradoxically his best opportunity, that is also doomed to fail. However he decides to stay and write a screenplay for bygone actress Norma Desmond, receiving a high salary even though he knows the screenplay will never take off. He had another choice he could take, to run off with Betty Schaefer, basically the complete opposite of Norma, and the film made a pretty clear contrast between the women/choices he had. He had many chances to get out of his situation, but instead he decided to essentially become a willing prisoner to wealth and riches, and ultimately paid the price for it. Overall, despite it's age it still holds up today which I think is an accomplishment by itself. Unfortunately the film didn't answer the most important question, what was the whole deal with the monkey??????",

I already saw the ending coming because of Nora and i personally didn't like it because it just ends with Nora being herself and then ""the end"".
