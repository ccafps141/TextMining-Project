0,7 March 2006,ccthemovieman-1,10," First, And Still The Best Of LOTR","Here is one film that lived up to its hype, and by the time I saw it after it had arrived at the video stores, I had heard and read a ton of things about it, and seen all the awards it had received, and expected a lot. To my surprise, it did not disappoint.",/

I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I've read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.",r

4,19 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, Near perfect adaptation of a fantasy benchmark,"Director Peter Jackson and wife Fran Walsh have successfully created an epic movie in both look and feel to equal J. R. R. Tolkien's novel (itself awarded the title of ""book of the century""), bringing to the big screen a film nearly flawless in its execution. My biggest disappointment is that two chapters are missing from the novel - Tom Bombadil and the following encounter with the barrow-wrights - but everything else is present and correct.",i

""Star Wars"" still hadn't come out yet, and realizing that the available technology could not do justice to the fantastic world presented by J.R.R.

7,11 November 2014,adamscastlevania2,10, Thank you Mr Jackson,"(95%) If the late 70's early 80's had the Star wars trilogy, then the 2000's had this epic fantasy masterclass. Regardless of whether you're a fantasy fan or not this is too good a movie to simply pass up, and it will be one of those movies that given time will prove it to be a classic. The deeper you look into this the more one notices that every single aspect really is a truly impressive accomplishment. The fact that every single sword used by the main characters was made by hand, with extra ones made only for carrying, fighting, etc, then there's the costumes/armor/props all made by teams of many people. They even made artificial trees for gods sake. But really all those things are just extras, what really makes this a unique watch is that it really does feel huge and sweeping, the sense of scale is fantastic and I can't think of anything that even comes close to matching it. What every epic flick needs this has, the cast is great, it's exciting, it has bags of character, it's funny, sad, superbly well made, with a great score and plenty of action. It's also one of very few 2 hour 30 minute + movies ever that leaves the audience wanting more. Since watching it around Christmas 2001 at a packed out cinema, and the many times I've seen it on DVD since, it never fails to impress and charm. All in all near perfect cinematic treat that keeps on giving.",/

9,30 November 2007,mstomaso,10," Part One: With Help, Even the Impossible Can Be Achieved","Peter Jackson set out to make movies which the author of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien would have endorsed. All three were resounding successes, though because of the film medium they necessarily varied from Tolkien's story-line. Purists may have issues with Jackson's theatrical license, but as someone who has read Tolkien's books several times and seen the films 4-5 times each, I never felt that Jackson went too far or compromised Tolkien's story, the mythology he developed or the wonderful characters he brought to life. Many have said what Jackson did could not be done. He has not only proved the nay-sayers wrong, but lovingly crafted a set of films which will, for many decades to come, stand out as a great achievement. ",w
10,3 August 2005,dee.reid,10, From the beginning...,"...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 Fangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson, the director behind the ""goriest movie ever made"" (1992's ""Dead Alive""), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga, which include ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001), ""The Two Towers"" (2002), and Best Picture Oscar-winner ""The Return of the King"" (2003).",0
11,16 August 2002,Theo Robertson,10, A Masterpiece,"I've never been a fan of the sword and sorcery genre . I'm surprised film companies decide to make rubbish like THE BEASTMASTER, HAWK THE SLAYER and RED SONJA but I am aware of the popularity of JRR Tolkien's massive novel LORD OF THE RINGS and of it's popularity , I remember in a survey carried out by a very well known British fantasy/SF magazine in 1987 Tolkien's book was voted the greatest fantasy novel of all time ( THE STAND by Stephen King was a long way second ) , but it's a novel that has always struck me as being read by anoraks who - like fans of STAR TREK and STAR WARS - insist on reading subtexts that are just not there . When the THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS shot to number one in the IMDb top 250 films I put the popularity down to obsessed anorakish fans who were going to vote the film a classic no matter what . Stranger still I found groups as diverse as neo Nazis to gays to enviromentalists proclaiming "" This is our film "" so when I finally sat down to watch TFOTR I was expecting only some average entertainment for a non sad person with no political axe to grind . After seeing the film I had to admit THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a masterpiece .",4
12,26 June 2002,jaesboxer,10, Tolkien's Brilliant Vision Realized Into A Perfect Film,"For the thousands of fans who thought it couldn't be done, to the skeptics and the critics who observed Peter Jackson's adaptation of the Lord Of The Rings into a trilogy would be the next Ishtar, a disaster of epic proportions, allay your fears.  The Lord Of The Rings:  The Fellowship Of The Ring is the most daring cinematic event to take place in years, and despite the fact it undeservedly lost the best picture oscar to A Beautiful Mind, it is, I strongly believe, a film for the ages.  NOt since Gone With THe Wind has an epic tale, critically acclaimed, been adapted into a film which is astounding in its own right.  The sets are marvelous, the characters portrayed to perfection (Most notably Ian McKellen as Gandalf), and the mythology of Middle-Earth brought to vivid life, combining to make a film that is both spectacular in its grandeur and engaging in its characters.  This is a film I believe equal to Lawrence Of Arabia in its scope, and I am anxiously awaiting the sequel THe Two Towers being released this Christmas.",6
13,3 January 2002,preppy-3,10, Excellent,"Incredible adaptation of the first book of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  I'm not going to summarize the story--there's way to much going on.  All I'll say is they took a verry difficult book with a intricate plot and made it an exciting, totally accesible movie.  The film moves quickly (with a few slow spots--but that's to get in the plot) and there's a lot to take in, but I was never confused.  I should mention that I tried twice to read the books but found them too hard.",0
14,28 February 2006,Mr_PCM,10, A truly exceptional film,There is very little that can be said about The Lord of the Rings that hasn't been said already many times over. But what can be re-iterated is that The Fellowship of the Ring is an outstanding piece of film-making.,9
15,2 March 2006,Hitchcoc,10, I Don't Know if They Could Do It Much Better,"I am not fanatic, though I have read the books a couple of times. My interest in J. R. R. Tolkien goes to his knowledge of the history of language as well as his work in fantasy. I've seen some of the bad animation that was done using his work. I always assumed that this would be the only vehicle that could be used to bring these works to the screen. Now with a new generation of special effects masters, we have a work of art like the world has never seen. Granted, there can never be a definitive work that matches the depth and poetry of the books, but this captures the charm, the wonder, the amazing epic. To see the Shire presented in the first scenes and the party in the home of Bilbo as the creatures of this amazing fantasy are exposed is one of those incredible moments. The story is set up for the ultimate adventure as Frodo paddles out onto that lake, not knowing what has been set in motion. I will leave the real reviews to others. My first thought upon seeing this was, I just hope I survive to see it to its conclusion.",2
16,7 January 2002,Aaron1375,10," Never read the book, but loved the movie!","I didn't know quite what to expect when I went into the theater, all I knew is that I wanted to see a fantasy film with sword fights, magic and monsters.  I was not disappointed.  It exceeded my expectations because it had all the stuff I mentioned and great acting, and good character development as well.  I was enjoying the movie so much that I was very disappointed when it ended.  I would have gladly stayed another six hours if the showed the next two installments of this flick.  That was the only bad part of the film is the abrupt ending, but I still give this movie a 10, because it is a trilogy and I was expecting it.  If you want to see a great movie, one that delivers where so many have promised, but failed to deliever then this is the film to see...even if you didn't read the book.  And for anyone who has read the book I would love to hear your take on the movie, just don't give anything away about the next two parts.",1

I don't care what the Academy says because without a doubt, it was the best film of 2001 (obviously... i said it was the best movie I've ever seen). It deserved the Academy Award 10 times more than A Beautiful Mind did. I mean look at the difference between ratings. LOTR: #3 ABM: #126 See a difference? LOTR will go on to be an unforgotten movie as what Star Wars is. In twenty years ABM won't even be on the top 250 list, while LOTR will still be in the top 50. SO LOTR fans just remember.

21,30 January 2002,Nachtritter,10, Never before in my life were my cheeks more aching...,"...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, I'm 25 years old, and I've read ""The Lord of the Rings"" in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Silmarillion"" as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbo's table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in ""The Hobbit"" book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron.",f

Some people refer to the Lord of the Rings trilogy as my generation's Star Wars (I was 12 when TFOTR was released), but I actually think it's better than Star Wars, and basically for one reason: the way director Peter Jackson has brought Tolkien's beloved classic to the screen.",_

24,22 December 2001,Yrneh,10, Greatest `Fantasy' Book become greatest `Fantasy' film,"I think it is important to remember that Peter Jackson took up this film not in order just to make a film of `The Lord of the Rings' but because he wanted to make a 'fantasy just like the `The Lord of the Rings'"" as he himself put it.  After repeating that phrase on a number of occasions the question popped into his mind: ""Well, why not the `The Lord of the Rings' itself?"".  In doing this he, of course, set himself an enormous challenge: he had to make a really good `fantasy' film, one which would stand on its own and be true to what he had originally wanted to do but he would also, and here the task he had set himself was enormous, be true to the original book and to make a film which the legions of people who have loved this book would feel happy with.  In the latter task he was certainly not helped by the author or the book: Tolkein, it would seem, hated cinema.  The book itself is `HUGE': this was not going to be the kind of task that the James Ivory team set themselves, or Scorsese nor the kind of task facing Branagh with Hamlet; nor was it going to be like the puny task that faced Columbus with `Harry Potter' who had the bigger budget ($130 million for one film as compared with Peter Jackson with $300m for three).",t

32,16 July 2002,happiscotsman,10, A Matter of Visions,"Roger Ebert only gave this film three stars because he felt it did not meet his personal criteria for what the movie should be like. But that is what Peter Jackson has been embellishing ever since he started on this nearly eight-year odyssey. It is Jackson's view of how HE would want the movie to be made. On that note, this film has been worth the three years I have spent salivating over any and every web site designed to proclaim the greatest film series ever (""Star Wars"" has lost its edge, and ""The Matrix"" has too narrow an appeal). The only reason I found out these movies were being made was because I was curious what Sean Bean had been up to. This was in 1998, and the wait was well worth it. New Zealand was the PERFECT place for filming Middle Earth, and Jackson does a fine job in making sense of the epic novel. The actors were all fine in their roles, although I still long for Sean Connery as Gandalf, even though Sir Ian McKellen did get an Academy Award nomination. Personally, I though the best performances were by Sean Astin and Sean Bean (Have I already shown my bias for the only man who could play Richard Sharpe?) And while the action scenes are quite engaging, the Rivendell scene stands out as my favorite. The first shots capture the mystery and splendor of Middle Earth's most enchanting and enigmatic characters, the Eldar (Elves to you non-readers of the novels). Howard Shore's Oscar-winning score is no better the here, with the ghostly chorus holding their notes as the Hobbits stroll mesmerized through this strange and beautiful land. The imagery is so engaging that the audience cannot help but be swept away as well. This is what movie-making is all about folks, and if you miss this, you've missed a lot.",

The film is set in an imaginary world, Middle Earth, where humans coexist with fantastic creatures such as elves, dwarfs, orcs's hobbit's etc. In this film, the balance of this illusory world is at stake because of the war against the evil lord Sauron, who eagerly wants to dominate, corrupt and submit all forms of life.

What makes this trilogy superior to the other three I mentioned is that they feature an instalment that is considerably inferior to the others.

40,30 August 2022,nickenchuggets,10, One movie to rule them all,"The sheer feeling of excitement I got while watching this movie was something I thought I would never get a chance to experience. Not really being an avid reader of Tolkien's works, I feel that (and this might seem like heresy to some people) watching this not only allows you to understand the huge Lord of the Rings universe more clearly, but also see it in all its stunning imagery and scenery. After all, this wasn't possible until this movie came out. There are so many incredible things about this movie that I don't even know where to start, and because it's still so recent, I was surprised by (but still aware of the fact) that it's often said to be one of the best films ever. Like always, I'll start by explaining the storyline, which perfectly sets up and establishes a vibrant fantasy world like no other. Fellowship of the Ring starts by telling us that in Middle-earth's second age, the lords ruling over the races of humans, dwarves, and elves have special rings given to them. They are all incredibly powerful, but the dark lord Sauron forges a ring of his own in his evil kingdom of Mordor. This ring (known as the One Ring), has a large portion of his own malevolent energy sealed into it. Sauron wants to eventually take all the other rings for himself and invade middle-earth. Eventually, a huge army of men and elves fight Sauron's army in Mordor, and he is defeated by a warrior named Isildur. Isildur has the opportunity to throw the One Ring into the flames of Mount Doom, which is the only place that can destroy it, but chooses not to. Although Sauron is defeated (for now), his ring still has a huge amount of power. It is lost at the bottom of a river for 25 centuries until a creature named Smeagol locates it. It corrupts him and turns him into monster. One day, Smeagol loses it and it's found by a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who has no idea of the tragic history of the item he now possesses. 6 decades have passed since Bilbo has found the ring. On his 111th birthday, he is visited by his old wizard friend, Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen). Gandalf tries to convince Bilbo to give up the ring because of its evil history, so he leaves on a quest and allows his nephew Frodo (Elijah Wood) to have access to all his belongs (including the ring). Meanwhile, Gandalf finds out that Smeagol was captured by Sauron's forces and tortured until he revealed the ring's location. He only told them that Bilbo had it, and that he lived in The Shire, but this was enough. Faceless horse riders dressed in black cloaks, known as Ringwraiths, scour Bilbo's neighborhood looking for the ring, so Gandalf and Frodo both leave. Gandalf travels to the fortress of Isengard to meet with the wise wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) to discuss what to do next, but the latter is actually allied with Sauron and traps Gandolf inside the structure. Frodo soldiers on. He takes some of his friends, Sam, Pippin and Merry, and arrives at a village called Bree. They're supposed to meet Gandalf here, but because he's been taken prisoner, he never shows up. After journeying a bit more with the assistance of a new ally named Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), the group are ambushed by Ringwraiths and Frodo is stabbed with one of their weapons, which has the power to turn him into one after a few hours. Aragorn's elf girlfriend, named Arwen, saves Frodo while being chased by ringwraiths, and gets rid of them by inducing a flood with her magic. Frodo is eventually healed, and Gandalf has managed to escape Saruman's clutches using a giant bird. While everyone sits around trying to decide what to do next, the newly established Fellowship of the Ring intends to destroy the ring by taking it to Mordor. On the way there, they try to scale a snowy mountain, but Saruman is aware of their efforts and tries to cause an avalanche. Frodo decides it's too dangerous and tells everyone they need to travel through the Mines of Moria instead, which isn't much better. While there, they fight numerous Orcs, a savage and warlike race who were once elves, as well as a huge troll. Sadly, Gandalf is apparently killed when he fends off an enormous demon called a Balrog so the others can escape unharmed. Finally, the group arrives at Lothlorien, an elf realm ruled by the queen Galadriel (Cate Blanchett). Here, Frodo learns from a vision that only he can take the ring to Mordor and destroy it. In one last attempt to take the ring back, Saruman raises an enormous orc army and sends it to the Kingdom of Gondor. Two warriors assigned to protect Frodo, Boromir and Legolas (Sean Bean and Orlando Bloom respectively) try their best to fend off the relentless stream of orcs, but Baromir is killed. Frodo and Sam then travel down a mountain pass. With Mordor in sight, Frodo knows what he must do. The quality of this movie blows my mind. Normally I'm reluctant to give movies made past the 1970s perfect scores, because to be honest few of them deserve it. With this one, it makes me realize that maybe watching a recent movie now and then is a good idea. There's so many reasons to praise this movie that I can do it all day long, but for me, it's three things: the incredibly rich and detailed environments, the compelling characters, and the engrossing story. I'm sure it's a well known fact that Lord of the Rings as a whole served to inspire countless other fantasy movies, books, and even video games, and it's not hard to imagine why. Tolkien's universe is ridiculously big, and contains a large number of kingdoms, realms, and countless other locations, each with their own unique backstories and histories. It doesn't take anything less than a masterpiece of a book to inspire a film of this caliber. The landscapes in this movie are just something to behold, and it's my firm belief that basically every single frame of it belongs in a museum. All the environments look different, but they're all incredibly dreamlike and captivating to stare at. I can do it for hours. The characters are the meat of the story, and LOTR doesn't disappoint in any way. Although Sauron doesn't appear much physically, you can feel his presence throughout the film because the ring has his life essence in it, and wants to find its way back to him. Throughout the entire movie, Frodo is carrying with him immense amounts of evil. I think we can all agree that Gandalf is one of the greatest characters in fictional history anyway, whether you're a fan of this series or not. The special effects too are definitely worthy of such a monumental series. Even 20 years later, they look amazing and just as real as the actors themselves, which can't be said for a lot of other modern films. There's so much more to the movie though that I've barely touched the surface. It's not like no one knows this, since Tolkien's books have been considered classics for decades for good reason.

Changes made from the text aid this, and the result is thrilling and wonder-inducing. It's a masterful piece of epic fantasy cinema, and the whole trilogy's place in my heart is secure.",

47,29 November 2014,Geeky Randy,10, The greatest fantasy film of all-time,"An absolutely gorgeous adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's first LORD OF THE RINGS installment detailing how well-meaning young hobbit Wood unwittingly inherits a ring from his adventurous uncle Holm which possesses a dark force that is powerful enough to end all life in Middle-Earth. Visually wondrous even for those who aren't that into the fantasy genre. This installment is particularly charming for less action and more character development and, for some reason, the Middle-Earth lingo works really well in this movie over the second and third films. Although FELLOWSHIP merely teases the viewer with the appearance of Gollum—while TWO TOWERS and RETURN are basically owned by Serkis as Tolkien's timelessly wretched creature who's not quite friend or foe—the movie is just too lovable to really even need his inclusion. McKellen is perfect as Gandalf the Grey, and Bean's performance brings to the foreground the genius of all these characters who suffers from similar temptations and weaknesses that we do in reality. It is FELLOWSHIP that holds the clearest mirror up to us, while the following two films kind of just linger in the wartime aftermath. The greatest fantasy film of all-time.",

The first time I left I knew I had seen something great...but I needed to see it again. I went back about two weeks later and realized this film is brilliant. The story is extremely strong. A simple story told complex, and greatly. Although I have not read the books I plan on eventually doing so now that I have seen the film. The acting is also a very, very strong part of this film. Elijah Wood deserved the Oscar for his portrayal of Frodo. He does such a great job. Also, Ian McKellen did a great job of Gandalf. The rest of the acting is great too. The directing is the best thing about this film along with the story. It takes you from place to place so well and vividly...it is amazing. Peter Jackson knew exactly what he wanted to when he walked into doing this film. He had an amazing vision. The music score is also another method of telling this story even stronger. It fits perfectly into any scene they are doing in the movie. If I have left anything out about this film I know why. There is so much I could tell you about this film and how much I love it but I will just point out those things. I cannot wait until ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"".

63,25 December 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, I was not in the target audience,"I have never read a single word of anything by Tolkien. This is not my genre; I have always disliked fantasy, and largely, adventure, as well. Prior to my viewing of this, I didn't care for Jackson, although The Frighteners had its moments. I put off watching this until tonight, where it was on TV. In other words, I cannot judge this as an adaptation, nor can I comment on the Extended Edition. What I can say is that this gripped me from the first frame and did not let go until the last one. That ought to give you an idea of how well-crafted and brilliantly executed a cinematic achievement it is. The plot is compelling and well-told. In spite of a large group of characters, this keeps track of, and develops, them all quite nicely. The acting is spot-on. I did find the comic relief to be annoying, but there's immensely little of it if you look at the overall running time, that aspect of it wasn't made for me(I can imagine kids enjoy it, and it's harmless and inoffensive), and it's easy enough to look past. This looks gorgeous all the way, and the effects are astonishing. The design of beings, locations and items is all creative and well-done. Cinematography and editing are excellent. This is very exciting, and the action is cool and has the impact it is meant to. The score helps the epic scope, and the foreign, non-human language-use makes the world we are seeing feel more strange and distant. There is nothing really offensive in this, though children might find the battle sequences too intense. I recommend this to everyone who can see themselves getting into this. 10/10",

70,12 January 2002,jon.h.ochiai,10, Heroic Fellowship,"Peter Jackson's first installment of the J.R.R. Tolkien, ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"" is masterful work with another outstanding performance from Sir Ian McKellen and a star-making performance from Viggo Mortensen as the Ranger, Strider. I have not read the Tolkien trilogy, though I was read ""The Hobbit"" way back in sixth grade. So I am not familiar with the Tolkien mythology and legacy. From what is presented on screen, screenwriters, Frances Walsh, Phillippa Boyens, and Jackson, have crafted a story of magic, courage, and honor. Peter Jackson gets great performances out of a large and talented cast, manages stunning visuals that never overwhelm the movie, and maintains a coherent narrative style. ",
71,26 February 2002,Rogue-32,10," More, more. I want more.","I've seen the film three times now and it gets better with each viewing. Peter Jackson told Charlie Rose (on tv) the other night that he wanted to make a film which transported him to another place, like the films he saw as a child did; he said films didn't really do that very much these days. I could not agree with him more.  This was one of the things that impressed me the most on my first viewing (that and the towering - no put intended - performance by Ian McKellan) - I DID get the feeling I was in a different world, a different time, and I TOO have been missing that in films.  Thank you, Peter.  I am hungrily awaiting the next two.",
72,9 August 2005,asticht-2,10, Brilliant and Intelligent,"For those of you like myself who are fans of the books of the same name,you will not be disappointed by this movie. Unlike the animated versions that have previously been made where much of the story was condensed either for budgetary constraints or time limits, the Fellowship of the Ring while it does take a few shortcuts, there are very few. It is very exciting getting to see places that up until now have been purely figments of my imagination portrayed by someones elses imagination on the silver screen. I felt myself holding my breath waiting to see the various locations of middle earth and how others have dreamed of them. The movie does a breathtaking job in transporting the viewer to this other world and does so with magic good enough to be from the hand of Gandalf himself. Yes, there are places where for dramatic reasons or to prevent a lengthy historical context that certain events from the book were either shortened, modified or changed. These changes however do not change the storyline itself and makes for a very entertaining movie. I do feel however that if you are one of the uninitiated, it would serve you to either read the book before going, or immediately after the film pick up a copy and read it as it will provide more breadth to the story than what an almost three hour film can portray. In addition, there are several scenes in the book that while not central to the main story, add more to the lore of middle earth and help to explain some of the history leading up to the time of the story. The characterizations in the film were very well done and the choices of the actors to play the hobbits were perfect. While I was somewhat anxious to have Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Samwise, after seeing how well they were portrayed on film left me no doubt that these actors did a very admirable job bringing the characters to life. The majority of the cast has some English accent which was my main concern. Both the principle American actors portrayed a passable English type accent themselves which helped prevent them standing out on their own. How the filmmakers made several average height men such as Wood and Astin, and probably more so John Rhys Davies as Gimli appear much smaller than their Elvish or human companions is spellbinding. Special effects in this movie while at first don't really seem to be that obvious eventually take on a more obvious tone as the fellowship moves further into the adventure. As one would expect from a magical world, many things which we take for granted from reading the books are very difficult to accurately portray in a live action presentation. The filmmakers not only did a good job, they surpassed by far my expectations and truly made the experience an enjoyable and fulfilling one. As with any film where there will be sequels coming out, the ending left me longing for December 2002 to follow our adventurers further on their quest.",

As a fan of the book my one complaint is there were some very good things left out which I regret will not be seen until the film is remade again in 20 years. There is simply too much material and for those who haven't read the book this is a shame. I don't doubt Jackson could have made the film quite a bit better if he had had the desire and license to take a hatchet to the source material and fashion it into a more conventional screenplay. This really would have involved working some level of closure into FOTR that was was not in the book. Has there ever been another movie made that was so clearly only a third of the whole story? I am really surprised at how many non readers of the book enjoyed the film. This is one movie where people where people who saw the film first will be blown away by the book.,

The movie is beyond impressive. In fact, there isn't any adjective that can do it justice. You have to see it to believe it. Peter Jackson adapted J.R.R.

For instance, the set-piece battle with the Balrog ran to two pages, the Tom Bombadil episode, during which practically nothing nothing of any consequence happened, ran to more than 20! I was always one for story more than texture, as a result of which I began to feel that Tolkien had been in desperate need of an editor who would have helped him strip a flabby 1,100 page book down to a pacey, punchy 500 or so (I'm not keen on reading poems in Elvish, but I appreciate that this is my point of view, not necessarily others').",

It's also great as a stand alone film. Co-writer/director Peter Jackson and company hit the ball out of the park with this movie. The movie looks great. It's stunningly beautiful at times. The script takes a dense book and makes it understandable. The cast is also terrific with standout work by Ian McKellen and Sean Bean. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a long movie that at times feels like it. But when it's ends, it feels like it just started. I remember when I saw this movie in the theater there was a father with his his teen son sitting in front of us. When the movie ended he turned to his son and asked in frustration ""That how it ends?"" (Obviously he didn't understand it was the first installment of three.) I should have told him that yes, that's how a great movie ends.",

People talked about it for years before it even came out. There was a lot of hype, a lot of buzz. And it earned it. This movie changed cinema. It paved way for a whole plethora of fantasy movies.

103,14 September 2015,Vartiainen,10, Pure fantasy,"J. R. R. Tolkien changed literature with his trilogy The Lord of the Rings. A new genre was created practically from nothing. Owing much to fairy tales and epics of old, yet still being something new, fantasy soon captured the imaginations of generation after another. The Lords of the Rings was written as a myth, as an epic, a tale about the struggle against ancient, undying evil. In it great warrior kings and armies of legend fought for the control of Middle-Earth against armies of darkness, filled with hordes of orcs, goblins and trolls. Yet it was a small, insignificant being, a hobbit from the Shire, that would decide their fate through his deeds.",
104,28 October 2002,Acolyte-2,10, Now that's more like it.,"The summary above relates to Lord of the Rings, The (1978) which I detested. Peter Jackson did a superb job bringing Tolkien's Middle-earth to the screen. However, I think it's current high rating is seriously premature. This movie cannot stand on its own. Like the book, it's a single continuous narrative split into three parts for reasons of length. Any ending such as it has will not be seen until Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, The (2003) arrives in theaters. Right now it's a work-in-progress. Evaluating it should wait until the entire story is finished.",
105,12 June 2013,drqshadow-reviews,10," The Word 'Epic' Gets Tossed Around a Lot Today, But Here It's Appropriate","Fellowship of the Ring, Peter Jackson's first swing at J.R.R. Tolkien's daunting mutli-volume masterwork, lands flush on the chin of fans and casuals alike. It's a gorgeous example of just how well a literary adaptation can perform with the right mix of passion, budget, vision and expertise. Jackson's direction, though quite long-winded, seems fat free and balanced with a good sense of when to press forward and when to admire its surroundings. The acting is a relatively broad mix - while Ian McKellen resides comfortably in the quasi-leading role of Gandalf the Grey and Viggo Mortensen is both gallant and inspiring as Aragorn, I found Elijah Wood just a bit too doe-eyed as the ring-bearing hobbit, Frodo. That's nit-picking at its finest though, admittedly, especially given the scene-stealing part played by the realm of Middle Earth itself. Staggeringly realized with an obsessive attention to detail, it's a stern flex of the artistic muscle unlike anything I've seen, before or after. Watching the film today, in the shadow of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, is doubly rewarding, as dozens of throwbacks to the events of that film are planted like seedlings throughout the landscape. For my money, this is the best plot of the three LotR volumes, to boot. With one foot planted firmly on the ground and the other teasing the abyss, it covers a gamut of emotions, isn't bashful about shedding important cast members, and gives its audience a sweeping taste of the many colors and flavors present in this world. A wonderful fantasy-adventure hybrid, spiced with action at all the right moments, that does its mythical source material (and the legion of associated fans) proud.",
106,1 September 2022,GusherPop,10, A true achievement in film.,"Peter Jackson adores DVD. He knew going in to his daring translation of Tolkien's fantasy that it wouldn't stop at the cinema. The idea of a finished film can be fluid: scenes excised for valid reasons can be reinstated for home consumption. So, for DVD, not a 'director's cut' replacing the theatrical version, but an alternative extended edit. Put back into the film seamlessly, the extra half-hour of footage doesn't denigrate the original cut, but enhances it like an encore. The tone and story don't change; the journey is deepened, even if the momentum slows. Book-devotees especially will delight in the re-inclusion of Bilbo's voiceover on bucolic Hobbit culture, the extension of Aragorn's backstory, and the small additions on the other members of the Fellowship. If any section feels improved, it is Lothlorien with Cate Blanchett's Galadriel: here we get the famous gift-giving sequence which will prove significant, in the films to come, while the thematic weight of the Elvish decline grows more prominent. Nothing is lost and plenty is gained - this Special Extended Edition DVD is precious indeed. ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" but the Hobbits themselves have been pushed off center stage. If the books are about brave little creatures who enlist powerful men and wizards to help them in a dangerous crusade, the movie is about powerful men and wizards who embark on a dangerous crusade, and take along the Hobbits. That is not true of every scene or episode, but by the end ""Fellowship"" adds up to more of a sword and sorcery epic than a realization of the more naive and guileless vision of J. R. R. Tolkien. The film is remarkably well made. But it does go on, and on, and on--more vistas, more forests, more sounds in the night, more fearsome creatures, more prophecies, more visions, more dire warnings, more close calls, until we realize this sort of thing can continue indefinitely. ""This tale grew in the telling,"" Tolkien tells us in the famous first words of his foreword; it's as if Tolkien, and now Jackson, grew so fond of the journey, they dreaded the destination. Jackson has used modern special effects to great purpose in several shots, especially one where a massive wall of water forms and reforms into the wraiths of charging stallions. I like the way he handles crowds of Orcs in the big battle scenes, wisely knowing that in a film of this kind, realism has to be tempered with a certain fanciful fudging.",
107,12 January 2020,Paok-Kilkis,10, Why It's The Best Of The Three,"I consider The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring not only the best LOTR movie but the best film of all time. The movie has much better cohesion from the sequels. It also has a far more organized screenplay. The story begins with two heroes, who later became four, then five, then nine and then the journey begins. The dangers are so many you need to hold your breath. There are deadly mountains, thunders, the mines of Moria, a place that has been held by the enemy, monsters, a sword-wielding fire demon called Balrog, Galadriel the Argonath, the death of some members and the break of the fellowship. I like that the heroes are all together instead of the sequels who are seperated. Also the movie has the greatest leitmotif in cinema's history. Every character, place and race has a theme of it's own. You hardly grasp the importance of music in film. It's an invisible layer of pure emotion that guides us or challenge us, or guides or challenges the drama itself. One other thing that this movie has and the other two don't is Sean Bean's character, Boromir which I find the most intresting character of the trilogy. His character in the end finds redemption and in my eyes it's the most heroic death I have ever seen. The ending is heartbreaking and it's surely one to remember. The movie's shooting began in 1999 and the CGI are better from movies like The Hobbit trilogy which is made almost 15 years later. That proves that practical effects are better that computers. It's been 20 years since 2001 and this trilogy has age perfectly. It's wthout a doupt the greatest fantasy movies of all time and no matter how many years will pass these movies will not been forgotten.",

Who would have thought that Sean Astin grew up to be a hobbit from his days as a ""goonie"" and Tobey Maguire who was best known for his role in the Ice Storm as Mike. Now he is the star of the film. He plays beside the wonderful attractive Orlando Bloom, John Rhys-Davies, the magnificent Christopher Lee as the dastardly wizard gone arye, Sir Ian McKellen as the wonderful charming gandalf(Sure he could play Macbeth and Shakespearan role but he certainly can play his friend, Dame Maggie Smith, in a Saturday Night Live appearance. He was just perfect and now he plays with his action figures. Then there is wonderful Sir Ian Holm (Just imagine two Sir Ians on the set, what are the chances). The film is about 3 hours and after all that there is still more and you want more. I only wished that they would finally give knighthood to Christopher Lee and John Rhys-Davies.",
