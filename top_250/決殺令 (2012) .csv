I am not an admirer of Tarantino but I have little to say about this film, inspired by a character from the sixties western-spaghetti films and mixing western with blacksploitation. Tarantino's style (exaggerated, showy, extravagant and excessive) is all there before us, but unlike other films I didn't feel that this was a problem or transformed the film into a kind of parody.",e

Notice I said entertaining and not necessarily enjoyable. There are a number of scenes that are clearly not enjoyable, in fact, downright troubling like the dog attack of the black slave D'Artagnan (Ato Essandoh) and the hot box scene involving Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). But over all, Tarantino has fashioned a well told revenge tale modeled on the Spaghetti Western genre of the Seventies. And it begins immediately with a classy credit for the 'friendly participation of Franco Nero', the original coffin dragging gunslinger from the 1966 film who's name is resurrected here because frankly, it just sounds really cool.",w

Quentin Tarantino's latest opus, a Western set two years before the Civil War, concerns a former slave named Django (Jamie Foxx). He is freed by bounty hunter Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) in order to help him with a bounty. Quite quickly, Shultz takes Django under his wing and trains him as his partner. But he made him a promise: that he would rescue his wife from a plantation owned by the ruthless Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). And rescuing her is not going to be all that easy.",7

14,10 August 2013,Hitchcoc,7, It's Like a Day at the Slaughterhouse,"I'm pretty broad in my tastes in movies. I've seen most of Tarantino. When I start watching, I know that peoples arteries will be pumped up to 250 pounds per inch. I haven't seen so many geysers since I was last at Yellowstone. I was taken in by the story. The establishment that there is evil out there and yes, there was racism in the old West. And I did enjoy the avenging angel. But when the gore started and it sounded like the lake washing up on the shore at midnight, I slipped away. I really didn't care what happened to these guys. This is just another one of those blood baths that have no end. Two hours and thirty minutes of it. They mistreated your wife. Let's kill everybody. Of course, they are all simplistically portrayed as consummate evil. Only Django and his guy are acceptable. And anyone else who is black, unless, of course, he's in it with the white guys. ",4
15,31 December 2020,Morejambo54,9, I like the way you write Quentin!,"This is a fun movie! Great acting, great soundtrack, great editing and great story! The scenes in the big house...top class! Every scene with Leonardo diCaprio was amazing! Now my problems with the movie: the main meat of the movie, the mid section, dragged on a little too long and some of the dialogue was a bit dull but it was necessary to tell the story. The opening of the movie though, was great, I was hooked instantly and the end was so chaotic and fast paced! I wasn't expecting this movie to be as hilarious as it was either, so many scenes had the timing of humour spot on and actually made me laugh out loud. The story isn't complicated or hard to follow which is good, I enjoyed being able to relax and watch the movie unfold. I like this...8/10",7

18,26 January 2013,planktonrules,8," Over indulgent, gross....but also terrific.","My biggest complaints about ""Django Unchained"" are ones that really won't matter to most people who see this film. After all, just about everyone knows that Quentin Tarantino's films are incredibly bloody, gross and self-indulgent. So, when you see a billion gallons of blood and bodies flying everywhere, you are not really surprised! This one does go a step further--there is some full-frontal male nudity and a few of the scenes were so gross and gratuitous that Tarantino has outdone himself. But still, you KNOW ahead of time that this is not a film to show your mother, Father Jenkins or your 6 year-old!! However, HOW far it goes will limit the film's appeal--you can be sure of that. Evan a large number of adults would be unable to stick with this one...it's THAT violent.",?
19,26 December 2012,terrellrobinson71,10, Brace yourself for True Tarantino,"Quentin Tarantino's 8th film ""Django Unchained"" is one hell of a movie. A brutal, bloody, terrifying, hilarious and awe-inspiring western disguised as a buddy movie that is so great that if John Wayne and Sergio Leone were alive now, they would've approve of this movie. It's designed to shock you, polarize you, test you and maybe even surprise you. But let me clear on this: If you are not a fan of bloody violence and the running length of 165 minutes, see a shorter movie. But if you love to see what Tarantino can do with movies like this, then you're in for a treat. Set during slavery in 1858, the movie follows Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is found by a bounty hunter disguised as a dentist named Dr. King Schultz (The always reliable Christoph Waltz) who hires him as a bounty hunter and a free man to find the Brittle Brothers. After finding them and hunting them down at a plantation run by Big Daddy (a remarkable Don Johnson), they relax for the winter only for them to go on a mission to find and rescue Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who is owned by Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) a man who runs a plantation known as Candieland. He even has a renegade slave as a servant named Stephen (A nearly recognizable Samuel L. Jackson, hidden in makeup and some prosthetics), who will have a part to play in the last half of the movie. I think Quentin Tarantino has outdone himself once again. Being in the filmmaking game for 20 years now, you can't deny and even reject his style in what he is bringing to the screen (He also has a cameo in here as well). His dialogue is like reading a book that grabs you and makes you want to know what happens next. The look and scope of the film is magnificent, thanks to a brilliant Oscar-winning cinematographer Robert Richardson and the late production designer J. Michael Riva. The performances in this film are brilliant. Having won an Oscar for ""Ray"", Jamie Foxx continues with his breathtaking performances that wows us. Here as Django, he is certainly fearless, baring his soul (and body) playing a man who is free from slavery, but can't be free by the rules and limitations of slavery. Christoph Waltz looks like he was born to be a part of Tarantino's entourage after his Oscar-winning performance for ""Inglorious Basterds"". Here, once again he brings humor and vulnerability to Dr. King Schultz. Never before have I ever seen an actor go that far and doesn't go over-the-top like Leonardo DiCaprio. As Calvin Candie, DiCaprio is certainly Oscar-worthy as a man who runs a tight ship by running a place where male slaves fight to the death and female slaves are being prostitutes and he seems to be the kind of guy to like even though he is a villain and he speaks Tarantino's dialogue like a pro. When he has a scene in which he reveals three dimples from a skull that belongs to his father, he is literally terrifying. Kerry Washington is superb as Broomhilda and Samuel L. Jackson is the real scene-stealer. The supporting cast is great from Walton Goggins, Jonah Hill, Michael Bacall, Michael Parks, James Remar, Robert Carradine to a small cameo by Franco Nero. ""Django Unchained"" has a lot of things to say about slavery and how cruel it is. But at the same time, it provides the fact that if Tarantino rearranged history by shooting Adolf Hitler to a pulp while everything blows up at a movie theater, he can do it again by having a former slave whipping a man who used to beat him and his wife. Now, that's entertainment. This movie really is off the chain. It's not only one of the most captivating films of the year, it's one of the best films of the year. Go see it, it will be worth your time. Keep in mind though, there are characters, especially Django, Stephen, Candie and Schultz that uses the N-word numerous times in this movie. That seems relevant to the time period, don't ya think?",r
20,14 July 2013,kosmasp,9, Beautiful and violent,"Sometimes the German equivalent of the MPAA can surprise us all. Not only did this movie get a rating (uncut), it also passed with a ""16"". I'm always happy, when they pass a movie uncut, so I won't complain. That doesn't mean, I'm not wondering what is going on in the heads of some of those people who decide what rating a movie gets. The movie even got some heat in America for its violence (then again it also got some heat, because of its male lead. One party decided it wasn't a good example for white people to be killed by a black guy, the other side thought it was unfair in its depiction of black people and so forth)! Saying it lead to people becoming violent(?).",e

22,31 December 2012,aharmas,6, A Little Too Much,"Let me make it clear. I did enjoy most of it, but I also found myself looking at my watch and hoping it would end sooner. If there was a film this year that more than deserves the adjective excessive, this is it. It's a decent film, with plenty of action, some very funny scenes, and three of the best performances of the year: Jackson's house slave is almost as good as Washington's performance. He's an interesting and complex character, somehow who we can't even imagine existed. He's the darker twin of Scarlet's mammy in ""GWTW"", way darker and just as fascinating. There's of course, another star turn by De Caprio, puzzling, magnetic, depraved, and ruthless, and Waltz creates another memorable character, a foreigner who can't comprehend what's going on in his world, but who doesn't stop from taking advantage of the situation without losing his soul.",_
23,30 December 2012,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,6, An Entertaining Mess,"Modern exploitation guru Quentin Tarantino serves up historical revenge once again.

24,24 April 2014,hall895,6, A messy movie,"You would be surprised if Quentin Tarantino ever made a truly bad movie. But he has made a few which, though not bad, are somewhat disappointing. Django Unchained is one of those. Honestly, this movie is a bit of a mess. An intriguing mess, at times a very entertaining mess. But still a mess. The movie gets away from Tarantino somewhat. His grand vision for what he wanted the movie to be ultimately lets him down. He couldn't let go of any of that vision, couldn't restrain himself. He put it all up there on the screen. And it proved to be just a little bit too much.",t
25,20 May 2013,claudio_carvalho,8, Highly Entertaining and Funny,"In 1858, in Texas, the former German dentist Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) meets the slave Django (Jamie Foxx) in a lonely road while being transported by the slavers Speck Brothers. He asks if Django knows the Brittle Brothers and with the affirmative, he buys Django for him. Then Dr. Schultz tells that he is a bounty hunter chasing John, Ellis and Roger Brittle and proposes a deal to Django: if he helps him, he would give his freedom, a horse and US$ 75.00 for him. Django accepts the deal and Dr. Schultz trains him to be his deputy. They kill the brothers in Daughtray and Django tells that he would use the money to buy the freedom of his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who is a slave that speaks German. Dr. Schultz proposes another deal to Django: if he teams- up with him during the winter, he would give one-third of the rewards and help him to rescue Broomhilda. Django accepts his new deal and they become friends. ",t
26,12 February 2021,one9eighty,8, Who's that stumblin' around in the dark? State your business or prepare to get winged!,"Tarantino's first western film sees him return with a lot of the usual Hallmarks that are associated with him as an auteur. This film is heavy on violence with lots of gunplay and fighting, and it is filled with plenty of dialogue which drives the story as much as the action. Like some of his other films there is also a theme of vengeance running through it, something that was explored a little in ""Inglourious Basterds"" by Shosanna and the American-Jewish commandos; in ""Death Proof"" by the surviving women; sort of in ""Jackie Brown"", ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" too. This time out though, the main vengeance is between a freed slave and slavers in the 1850's wild west.",_
27,26 December 2012,mistarkus,9, Tarantino Epic,"By incorporating a multitude of thematic Tarantino elements Django is the best Tarantino movie SINCE Pulp Fiction. Not as good as that great movie since this one is a little more bloated and less novel, it nonetheless is Tarantino's second best movie. This was great because it used many of the best aspects of the other Tarantino films. Such as the friendship between a black and white antihero (a hit-man like in Pulp Fiction but now the male bonding is as bounty hunters), also the violence art similar to Kill Bill and the Gut Warming, heart pounding, pulpy thrill of revenge against an evil like in Inglorious Bastards. There were many other aspects of Tarantino's movie in this one. ",u

31,29 December 2012,zardoz-13,5, Tolerably Entertaining,"Quentin Tarantino's antebellum western ""Django Unchained"" is far more palatable than his appalling World War II epic ""Inglourious Basterds."" Nevertheless, Tarantino adopts a tongue-in-cheek attitude toward 'the peculiar institution,' while he sets a new record for the number of times the politically incorrect N-word is used. The saving grace of ""Django Unchained"" is nobody behaves as clownishly as Brad Pitt did in ""Inglourious Basterds."" Meaning, aside from its gratuitously-violent, revenge-fueled narrative, ""Django Unchained"" qualifies as a fair to middling horse opera that pays greater tribute to Fred Williamson's Blaxploitation westerns than Sergio Corbucci's Spaghetti westerns. Tarantino depicts southern plantation owners contemptuously as sadistic stooges along with anybody who conspires with them--whatever their pigmentation. Few surprises occur during its marathon 165-minutes. The absence of Tarantino's long-time editor Sally Menke, who died in 2010 from heat stroke, may account for this meandering melodrama. The first hour should have been seriously trimmed, but it provides you with adequate opportunities to contend with super-sized soda drinks. Sadly, ""Django Unchained"" generates little excitement until Leonardo DiCaprio enlivens things with his presence. He makes his character's obsession with phrenology appear frightening genuine. You know that he is a villain because he smokes too much. Tarantino stages one long, blood-splattered shoot-out that looks like a homage to ""Saving Private Ryan."" This kind of exaggerated violence will make the squeamish cower. Conversely, gore hounds will admire the abundant use of exploding computer-generated body parts.",

33,16 March 2013,billygoat1071,9, Behind The Violence,"Django Unchained is a Western film that is thematically about revenge against slavery and racism. The film clearly understands how terrible this condition is, thus it gets interesting to that point. Since this is a Quentin Tarantino film, he never abandons his own style. Just like any of his films, it is brilliant in craft, gives a set of memorable characters charmed by the performances, and a high entertainment quality. The journey is quite enjoyable, though towards the end it disappointingly creates a misstep but it's all good anyway. Django Unchained hasn't beat Tarantino's best but it still can be memorable and undeniably enthralling.",

Rather than the taciturn Leone/Eastwood hero ""The Man With No Name"", he picks the sub-genre's second best-known icon to do so – which is just as well since he subverts him into a caustic smart-ass of a colored slave, thus enabling Tarantino to hit two birds with one stone and equally pay would-be homage to such infamous exploitation fare as GOODBYE UNCLE TOM (1971) and MANDINGO (1975).

Awesome performances, great story, it will definitely take you on a ride full of surprises. I would recommend everyone to go watch this film, it is truly a great film.. unless you're a little kid.. don't go watch this movie if you're a little kid. I've seen all of Tarantinos movies and I have to say this has been my favorite. It is just awesome in every way. I'm usually very harsh on movies. I mean ill watch just about anything, but for me to think a movie was actually ""good"", takes a whole lot. DiCaprio was like i've never seen him before, and being one of my favorite actors, it was a little weird at first. But he does an outstanding job at selling his role within seconds of his first appearance. Waltz delivered as i knew he would. and Jaime Foxx, well he did not fall behind.

Glad I did. This was absolutely one of the best movies of the year. Although Jamie Foxx has top billing, this film would not have been anywhere as good without Christoph Waltz. He stole every scene he was in. Brilliant acting and great comedic delivery. Leo was great too. Lots of blood, something expected in most of Quintins movies, but a great story.

53,27 January 2020,lukem-52760,6, TARANTINO'S WILD WILD WEST,"Another great Tarantino film & another big hit, here Tarantino takes us back to the old south just before the Civil war & drops us off in the horrible racist Slavery times & takes us on a violent & bloody quest of vengeance!!!
Tarantino DEFINITELY watched Will Smith's WILD WILD WEST whilst preparing this move!!!!
Tarantino is an outstanding film maker as we know & here he delivers all the quality & great dialogue we've come to expect & his casting is again Amazing with an excellent Jamie Foxx as the ""Django"" the freed slave in search of his beautiful wife played by Kerry Washington, & ""Django"" is helped by a German bounty hunter named King Schultz, an outstanding performance by Christoph Waltz, the two become partners as bounty hunters & Django becomes an incredible marksman who can really handle his guns. The two Bounty hunters go from town to town & plantation to plantation in search of Criminals & Django's wife, this leads them to the evil plantation owner Calvin Candie, an excellent performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as such a nasty & evil villain of this piece. There's also Tarantino regular Samuel L Jackson as an evil black butler type who is just as racist as the Southern whites!!! There's lots of other great actors in small roles & there's lots of very funny moments & black humour throughout but there's also still the dark & raw look into the evil times of slavery & it gets extremely violent & bloody. I loved this mix of fact & fiction turned into a revenge fantasy just like Tarantino did with his ""Inglourious Basterds"" & his ""Once Upon A Time In Hollywood"" that's why he's such a great story teller & film maker. I did notice alot of similarities to the excellent but underrated Will Smith western ""Wild Wild West"" from 1999, now i know the part of ""Django"" was written with Will Smith in mind but he turned it down, so there's lots of bits & bobs & scenes & it's look that Tarantino obviously borrowed from Smith's Wild Wild West!!!
Smith would've been excellent as Django as he's a great actor but hey we got the excellent Jamie Foxx & he nailed the part as extremely tough & raw freed slave.
When the killing gets going it's so exciting & gripping as these evil Slave traders so deserve to die brutally & Django delivers, my favourite line in the movie is ""I like the way you Die boy"" from Django before he blasts an evil redneck in the chest, it's beautiful.",

55,30 December 2012,blanbrn,6," Raw, violent, wicked and wild revenge wild west style, yet a shoot em' up black Tony style.","Most of Quentin Tarantino's works are well done and they push the limit often paying homage to B list cinema and underground works with the director often putting a stamp of violence and outrageous scenes in most of his works and ""Django Unchained"" is no different! The film is blended with raw humor and wicked scenes of blood and violence which were set in the slave days of the deep south. Here Tarantino takes the slave theme to the max ending in all out war and revenge. Yet the story is entertaining and clever you have a well to do dentist Dr. King Schultz(the terrific veteran Christoph Waltz)who goes rogue and becomes a bounty hunter and he acts underneath as a slave freedom crusader. As Dr. Schultz purchases a young but rough and rugged slave named Django(Jamie Foxx)who in return for freedom will work with the doctor to hunt down wanted rich and evil slave owners. Yet a prize awaits for Django in the end as the goal is to rescue his slaved wife Broomhilda(Kerry Washington). And the journey is interesting with plenty of blood, guts, and violence thru the south and rural dirty roads that lead to the big house of the arrogant and rich big time Mississippi plantation owner mister Calvin Candie(in a to the max and well acted role by Leonardo DiCaprio). Overall this film may not be everyone's cup of tea yet take away the outspoken and brash talk and the blood and guts it teaches you life, liberty, and freedom and that's okay even if it is in a revengeful form.",

Let's set aside that Tarantino's movies never have any substance and are exercises in retro, gory, fetishist camp. Let's ignore that the story arc is off and the film is way too long. Also, that there are massive issues regarding all kinds of credibility. Which leaves the two main problems with this adolescent mess. The first is: what would you say about any film centered on two races of people, in which one race is, with a single exception, shown to be nothing but a vast collection of savage, cruel, stupid buffoons? That's what QT happily does to the white race in this, his attack on racism. Then, there's the blatant theft of Mel Brooks's 'Blazing Saddles' in the many n-word remarks geared for laughs and the idiot pre- Klansmen. Never was a big Brooks fan, but at least he never had the gall to pretend he was making a statement.",
57,18 January 2013,murtaza_mma,9, A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's scurrilous lampoon on human trafficking,"Django Unchained presents the larger-than-life tale of a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) who collaborates with Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz)—a German dentist-turn-bounty hunter—in order to rescue his wife from the servitude of a ruthless Mississippi plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). The story begins in the US state of Texas in the year 1858—two years prior to the start of the American Civil War. The tone of the movie is set by Luis Enriquez Bacalov's original ""Django Theme Song"" sung by Rocky Roberts—taken as it is from Sergio Cobucci's Django (1966)—which plays with the opening credits. Django Unchained is Tarantino's tribute to the visionaries of Western filmmaking—those who conceptualized the decorated genre and more so those who prevented it from dying by reinventing it. The Western genre has always fascinated Tarantino. Right from the beginning of his career it has been his dream to make a Western of his own. Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci are the two filmmakers who seem to have inspired him the most. With Django Unchained, Tarantino finally seems to be living his lifelong dream of emulating his childhood idol. And what makes Django Unchained even more special is the fact that it comes at a time when the Western genre once again finds itself on the brink of obsolescence.",

64,3 January 2013,rcastl2335,2, Quitting Quentin,"Like Inglorious Basterds, this is another juvenile cartoon by the perennially adolescent Tarantino. However this time he manages to make it a racist cartoon, as well. How is it racist? Tarantino plays out a macho fantasy game by featuring a strong though implausible African American protagonist and yet spreads the N-word liberally throughout the film. He's defended that particularly odious over-usage by suggesting that being ""authentic"" to the times demanded it. And yet much of the film's details are otherwise incorrect: the rifles are wrong for the time period, for example; and the soundtrack is a hodgepodge of rap, old pop (Jim Croce?) and music from other films. And most obviously, the racial attitudes of both white and African Americans are simply ludicrous. The taunting, insolent attitude by Django towards white people would never have been tolerated in the South, circa 1858. And certainly no Mississippi plantation owner would allow him at the dinner table with white guests. Tarantino has also led many to believe--dishonestly, this is his version of an Italian western. However, it hews closer to a sub-genre of Seventies Blaxploitation--Westerns (Buck and The Preacher, Take A Hard Ride and very obviously The Legend of N---- Charley and its sequel The Soul of N---- Charley, to name a few.) Of course there are the standard QT touches in the film: odd flashes of humor, odder cameos (Michael Parks, Lee Horsley, Don Johnson, father and daughter Russ and Amber Tamblyn) and over-the-top violence--although even the violence is handled ineptly. The gushing blood shots look more like exploding balloons over-inflated with red paint. QT hasn't lost his touch with actors and he gets good performances from his leads--Waltz, Foxx and especially DiCaprio. Samuel L. Jackson as the boss of the African American house crew gives a masterly performance reeking of evil. But all of it comes in service to a trashy, overlong and digressive film. Tarantino is over-due for a course in films not marketed to 13 year old comic book readers or grindhouse fans. Until he shows an adult perspective I think I'll forgo any more of his films.",

Certainly individual directors, actors and producers like to be involved in something which is a little less like selling your arse to the highest bidder, but when the chips are down making a mountain of moolah, and then some, is the name of the game.

67,8 January 2023,dalyons-09311,10, Tarantino's Most Entertaining Movie,"I know everyone loves Pulp Fiction and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, but from my point of view, Django is Tarantino at his finest. To some extent it's his most ""normal"" movie, with in-order storytelling and no narration, but the camerawork, dialogue, and over-the-top violence scream Tarantino. Everything in this movie is perfect. There's plenty of action, comedy, and drama. I think it uses its length better than his other movies. Hollywood and Pulp Fiction felt rather long, but despite the fact that Django features an extended dinner conversation, the intensity of the movie never drops. It's incredibly engaging. The dialogue is incredible, with plenty of callbacks and clever humor. This movie has dozens of quotable moments, including the hilarious raid scene. The Brittle Brothers flashback is utilized perfectly. The performances are amazing. Waltz's Oscar is well-deserved, but honestly Leo might be the best here. His portrayal of Calvin is scary and cunning, and I love that the blooper with his hand getting injured was kept in the movie. I wish there was an Oscar for best villain. Samuel L. Jackson is great as always, and Jamie Foxx nails the title role. Watching him get progressively more confident is so fun to watch. The use of Ennio Morricone's music is brilliant as well. Most importantly, this movie is probably the best example of one of my favorite parts of Tarantino's movie. I don't really like watching movies based on a true story because usually the truth is depressing and disappointing. Tarantino is more of an optimist and features movies that ask ""what if history went right?"" Inglorious and Hollywood are great examples as well. Django is an inspiring story that's so satisfying.",

This film is a combination of spaghetti western and blaxploitation. I know I am odds with others, but I don't find hearing the ""N"" word at least 100 times entertaining; watching two men fight to the death as ""entertainment"" (the hammer used to kill one of the two wrestlers); the murder of a black man by a pack of vicious dogs; constant whipping, etc., etc., etc. - and with all that said, my least favorite character, by far, was Django - he's supposed to be ""hip"" and manly and blah blah blah, but he's really just a despicable macho jerk.

72,14 January 2013,PWNYCNY,10," Strong, powerful movie.","This movie is a spoof on the so-called spaghetti western genre, but with the violence ratchet up to a level probably unimagined in years past when the the spaghetti westerns gained popularity. The entire story is permeated by violence, which is shown in all its graphic goriness. There is no act of violence too gory for this movie. People are shot, clubbed, knifed, blown up, whipped, cudgeled, mauled, beaten and stomped as well as humiliated, put down, made fun of, laughed at, bullied, and yelled at. The theme of this movie is that interpersonal conflict can be resolved only through violence, and not just nineteen-thirties type violence, i.e., a drive by shooting or a quick ambush, but by violence that is sadistic, that is, gives pleasure to the character perpetrating the mess. But along with the violence is the use of the ""N"" word which is uttered probably hundreds of times in the movie, and by all the principal characters, black and white. In a way, it seems that the ""N"" word has finally arrived. Now, is all this violence gratuitous? The answer to that question is NO! No way. Although the violence is Hollywoodish and played up to the extreme for dramatic effect, it still belongs in the movie because the story is set in a time and a place when physical violence as a way of regulating people was a norm and when people were openly exploited and physically abused. The idea of a white slaver raising a bunch of mandingoes may seem ludicrous, but such activities occurred. Black people were slaves; white people were masters, and the ""N"" word was part of the normal lexicon of the time. The acting in this movie is outstanding. Samuel L. Jackson and Christoph Waltz deserve special recognition, and the rest of cast is excellent too, especially Leonardo De Caprio who plays a villain to great dramatic effect.",

Quentin is keeping exterminating his own film-making; burnt out, there's little chance of recovery. He lost his innocence and the genuine investment of the real geniuses that have lived. That's it. I have already written about that not long ago; there's nothing more to do for Tarantino than to laugh his way to the bank. What a loss for all involved. I can understand that Christoph Waltz, Leonardo Di Caprio, Morgan Freeman and Jamie Foxx and many others allow themselves to become involved in the making of a new film and, perhaps, in a performance, in a project with a filmmaker who proved he was somebody... but this garbage is denigrating the art of cinematic storytelling, this is compromising the ability for the young moviegoers to never enjoy in the future any resource and representation of life. What's your name? – Django – Can you spell it? An exchange between Jamie Foxx and Franco Nero, the man who first played Django in 1966, a Damned Great Movie, that time has left behind, which happened, for a sterile profit-only engagement, to fit the name.

76,2 January 2019,andrewroy-04316,8," While brimming with great actors, scenes, and styles, Tarantino mangles the tonally inconsistent third act","Django succeeds in so many areas - it crosses many genres, and despite its long runtime is propulsive and enjoyable throughout. It does have a great script with both funny and tense interactions. The plot is simple but effective as we are drawn into Django's story and Schultz's thoughtfully planned adventures. There is no doubt about the quality of the cast - Foxx and Waltz are excellent and Di Caprio steals every scene he's in, with a manic gleam in his eye. Tarantino is still a terrible actor and should really stop indulging himself with relevant roles in his movies. Race is at the heart of the movie, and I think Tarantino did manage to portray the time period and ideas appropriately. Where the movie turned from an equally fun and tense, sharp experience was the frustrating third act. The plot is shaky in Schultz acting so rashly and not prepared to kill the other men after Candie, and to a lesser degree in the willingness of the men to listen to Django's plan from the start. The biggest problem was the shootout, where Tarantino clearly couldn't resist making it a gratuitous, over-the-top spectacle. The deaths were wildly visually exaggerated, and while the movie had cleanly balanced its humor and intensity earlier, the shootout discarded both in favor of superficial, bloody action. It was so jarring to me as a viewer, being transported to this completely different tone and cinematography style. The ending message also does simplify the more complex plot and thematic developments to Django being a badass and getting revenge and his girl, which was a small letdown. It is epic, and the scene where Who Did That To You started playing was invigorating, that shootout scene just took me out of the movie, and minor errors like that kept it from being the knockout I was so ready to proclaim it.",

Unlike, say, GHOST DOG: WAY OF THE SAMURAI or THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS, DJANGO UNCHAINED doesn't seem as much like a filmmaker paying homage to what has come before as grave robbing. Sure, everybody does it, but the two aforementioned movies were done with a bit more genuine love, it seems, than this one. Scenes drag on interminably (THIS script won an Academy Award???), which is bad enough, but my biggest gripe has to be the PERFORMANCES. I don't know who the lead actor is (nor do I care), but he reminded me of the actors in movies like THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVERA and SIX STRING SAMURAI: he's clearly an actor doing his lines- nothing more; we never, at any point in the pointless proceedings, feel like he IS the character. The scene where we see Django's djunk was more than a tad odd: the actor holding said djunk does so gently, and releases the djunk carefully. I'd be willing to bet that that was co-star Jaime Foxx's favorite day on the set... (Ah, to be cradled in the loving hands of a caring director...)",

The 'damsel-in- distress' is a classic theme in literature, art and film. The damsel is usually a beautiful woman placed in a dire predicament by a villain, who requires a hero to achieve her rescue. In Tarantino's film, Dr. King Schultz, a German bounty hunter, takes great pains to compare Django to Sigurðr and Broomhilda to Brynhildr (the latter characters from the Norse Völsunga mythology). Broomhilda/Brynhildr is a stock character of fiction, particularly of melodrama.

A ""Dead or Alive""-handbill with its sketchy description and drawing is not very reliable and shooting the wrong guy can easily happen and it will just as easily get yourself hanged. Therefore the recruiting of Django does make perfect sense. Looking for another wanted man Schultz enters the next town, where he's never been, meets him, who is now the sheriff of this town and whom he's never seen, and kills him after a few seconds, without even talking to him.

110,8 January 2013,lazargorenc,4, Bad taste gone worse,"First I must say that I rarely write reviews. Most are already there to help a viewer decide whether to see the movie or not. An experienced moviegoer can always tell if the reviewer knows what he's talking about. But with Django unchained, that was such a horrible flick with sky high ratings, I just felt the urge to write down how disturbingly flawed and deeply deranged this movie is and not in a good way. It's been a long time since I have seen a good Tarantino movie. This era ended with his story and his part in Four Rooms. And after Kill Bill, things went downhill never to crawl back up. Every once in a while, Tarantino's flashy and expensive garbage is being spilled on theater screens all over the world, and the somewhat schizophrenic director surprisingly picks up even more fans along the dodgy way. I expected more from this movie, since I couldn't even sit through that dreary Inglorious bastards, so things had to get better. And yet, even though he had a perfect plot setting in a cruel time and place for black people in American history, he casted the still boyish looking I-must- be-the-bad-guy-in-that-movie DiCaprio who really gives his best to sell it but falls short, and you get yet another long term drug use flashback in a form of give-me-back-my-money drive-in movie, with an hour long boring film within a film - during the visit to Candie Land that starts with what can only be described as the first MMA fight ever held in a living room. In this openly racist movie, and not because of the excessive use of the n-word, whose star later promotes gun ban while making good money by shooting every white creature in this film that has sudden twists from serious to absurd, from grave to bizarre. Here we get a bad writing, bad music, bad casting, mediocre acting from an all-star cast and awful, awful direction. The dynamic sound makes you jump off your seat when someone slams the door on screen. How cheap is that? Well, the music was OK, but not for one playlist and certainly not for one western. You just can't mix Rio Bravo style songs and Elvis impersonator with modern rap music and get away with it. Unless your main character can spill buckets of blood with just one bullet or massacre crowds of armed rednecks just after practicing his gunslinger skills by shooting down a few bottles. We also see a drawer slide mounted Derringer save the day one time too many. We see black slaves speak fluent German. But this is a love story, and yet these extreme action scenes are the high tide here with tons of ketchup spills all around, with over the top gore that would make a B-slasher-movie look like British rom com, and the drab dramatic part will bore you to death and make you consider leaving the theater. Twice. What Quentin tries to achieve here, style wise, is the bleak mix of Gibson's The Passion of the Christ and Jesus Christ Superstar. But someone should've told him both movies are bad. Also, Samuel L. Jackson's pathetic make-up as well as his cartoonish role do not make things any better. I didn't expect to see Open Range, but this charade is a kind of rich gumbo, made out of all the bad ingredients from previous hyped Tarantino grindhouse style obsession movies or his dull WWII affirmative action fairy tale, that was oddly not enough spiced with finger licking good hot sauce from Leone, Hawks or Peckinpah, hence completely ruining this bad taste cinema and rendering it inedible. Now seeing these ratings, no wonder Gangnam style is the most viewed YT video ever. No wonder Hobit, Harry Potter, Batman, Spiderman and Lord of the Rings top the Best 250 list.",

However, it is the sharp performance of Leonardo DiCaprio as the cruel and merciless plantation owner Calvin Candie that steals the show in this violent tale set in the south prior to the civil war. Inspired by the 1966 Italian made western Django, Tarantino wrote a script for this film that accent and combine his unique style of filmmaking with the ""spaghetti western"" genre while presenting an eye-opening look at slavery in the deep- south during that period.

120,10 January 2013,Robert_duder,9, Tarantino doing what Tarantino does best,"This is a film that I couldn't help go in with some high expectations. First of all, close friends told me how amazing it was. In fact some said it was one of the best movies they had ever seen. Critics have been raving and audiences have been bubbling and now awards all over the place. Django is a great film. Its a revenge western done the only way Tarantino does it, exploitative, insane violence with a 70's Grindhouse vibe. It fits the bill in every way. You can't say you didn't know what you were in for if you know Tarantino. Its well done and its entertaining and stylish in his style. I actually hoped this would be a huge ten for me because I do love Tarantino though I only discovered him in the last ten years or so. As good as it was, I had some issues. I hate saying a film is too long because I love every second I spend in a theatre but it was a massive three hours long. It could have easily been split into two in the same vein as Kill Bill was. That being said I give him kudos for not milking a film the way so many series are nowadays. Still I think with some better editing, the film could have been chopped ever so slightly and still kept its integrity. I found a certain issue with the plot as to why Django and the Doc went through such elaborate hoops to trick Candie instead of offering him a ridiculous amount to buy Django's wife. I know I'm not the only one bothered by this plot from the IMDb boards. And finally I felt like Jamie Foxx's lead performance of the title character lacked something. He didn't feel like the hero or anti-hero. He wasn't quite as bad-ass as I expected and with two or three really exceptional performances, Foxx felt less than stellar.",

This is not the meta-trash he specializes in, this is just pure unadultered trash: no intelligence, no originality, no irony, no second layer of meaning, no redeeming grace.

As regards acting, this movie should leave a few of the famous thinking like Silvester Stallone after he made Rhinestone. I understand he basically paid to have that movie taken out of circulation.

125,24 January 2013,ironhorse_iv,9," When I heard about this movie it had my curiosity, but now, it haves my attention","The movie isn't a Western. The film starts out in pre civil war South, several male slaves are chained and being transported. Among the slaves is Django play by Jamie Foxx who has been sold away from his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). The slave owners then encounter Dr. King Schultz play by Christoph Waltz, a German immigrant dentist and bounty hunter. Schultz takes Django from them revealing that he sought out Django to aid him in identifying the Brittle brothers, a trio of ruthless killers. The two come to an agreement: in exchange for helping locate the Brittles, Schultz will free Django from slavery and help him get his wife Broomhilda from the current owner Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin Candie by posing as potential buyers of a Mandingo slave fighter. The reason Dr, Shultz helped Django is because he was moved by his story and felt obligated to help because of the German legend of Siegfried and Broomhilda. Schultz would introduces Django as a free man and an expert on Mandingo fighting. Django raises the suspicions of Candie's staunchly loyal house slave, Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), who correctly deduces that Django and Broomhilda know each other, and that the Mandingo sale is a ruse. A lot of films inspiration Quentin Tarantino to make this movie. One inspiration for the film is Sergio Corbucci's Django, whose star Franco Nero has a cameo in this film. Other inspiration are the 1970's films Mandingo, and the Great Silence. The costumes of the film were also references from works such as Thomas Gainsborough's 1770 oil painting Blue Boy, 'Big Daddy' Don Johnson Miami Vice white vanilla suit, King Schultz's Kojak like chinchilla coat, Broomhilda's Ida Galli's dress style from Blood for a Silver Dollar and Calvin Candie's costume came partly from Rhett Butler from 1930's Gone of the Wind. Quentin also has a kicking soundtrack, ranging from Elisa Toffoli 'Ancora Qui', Beethoven's Fur Elise, Dies Irae from Verdi's Requiem to modern hits from Tupac, John Legend, & Rick Ross. I can do without the Rick Ross. Rick is an overweight, rapping, misogynist who raps about gang violence and drug sales that has nothing to do with slavery. Few of the rap songs that played kind of took my brain out of the time period. For me, in terms of dialogue, it outmatches even Pulp Fiction, it's not just clever and ironic, it's gripping and brilliantly paced. One of the best dialogue scenes focus on Calvin Candie with the skull talking to both Dr. Shultz and Django. Like Dr. Schultz, I Couldn't Resist finding out that, when Leo punches the table & breaks the glass, he actually gashed his hand open while filming that scene and just kept going. You could tell that Kerry was taken aback when he wiped the blood all over her face. It was his real bloody hand. The acting is brilliant. Waltz and Dicaprio outdid themselves. The blood and violence can be over the top at times. The violence was gawdy, the squibs used were over the top, even for a gory movie, its a caricature of his passed films, in a very horrible manner. Jamie Foxx as Django was OK as the hero, but I felt the character became way too dark in the end of the film. Not only he lost most of his humanity when Dr. Shutlz force him to kill the farmer, but also bossing around the other slaves. Honestly, I know it's a cover within Candyland, but it's seems Ray Charles was just there to shot white people in the face in revenge show in the film by killing Candie's sister. Also with enough bullets, you can get what you want. Like freedom, equality, and slight remnants of civil liberties. Martin Luther King's civil disobedience doesn't go anywhere. I felt that to be wrong message being sent out. Django true enemy is Samuel L. Jackson's Stephen. Pure gold in funny one liners, Jackson stole the show as the character is so damn racist. Stephen is an angrily self hating black man, whom disassociates himself from other African American. The Uncle Tom character in this film. Some people have complained about it saying the 'N' word too much, but I have to imagine back then it was just a commonplace word; I didn't feel like the movie was using it excessively or in poor taste. Still, I'd say that Tarantino was actually uncharacteristically sensitive to race in this film. I reject criticize that it disrespects black ancestors because it has some comic elements. On the contrary, I believe that it is the lack of discussion about horrors of slavery that hurts black history. I think more slavery movie should be made and Tarantino somewhat brings light to a sour subject here. There were scenes in the movie that gave audience members a hard time to take in and somewhat painful to watch. Firstly, that is not a slavery movie, but a love story and a western spaghetti that occurred during slavery time, it's might seem like a pro black film, but it's for real moviegoers who love stories. Quentin was dynamite directing and writing this. This movie was a montage of everything you would ever want in a movie. It's three hours long, but it's go through you fast. If you haven't seen it yet, I'd recommend it.",

138,16 July 2015,zaid-87403,7, Django Unchained Rating and Reiview,"Interesting plot, story and events. Above average soundtrack and good actors who are really amiable and suitable. Excellent photography and directing of the movie. Holds excellent messages though many things need to be clearer. Just enough comedy to be mixed with drama. Sequence of events is good to very good but could've been much better. The movie was very good and had just the perfect amount of western style inclusion but for most people I think they expected more in addition to the amount of drama. The movie showed how crucial the slavery of black people was but didn't show how crucial it was for the other blacks (other than him and his wife and couple of others) and this was very disappointing taking into consideration how long the movie was. I think the movie should've been also count as a drama and an action. Overall, the movie was very good and fun to watch and sophisticated in a way, plus it was just enough western and drama that will not make you depressed.

139,4 January 2014,A_Different_Drummer,3, R U Kiddin' Me?,"Let us harken back to the 1960s. In America the advent of the TV western had pretty much killed off the big screen western, based on the notion that, why buy the milk when the cow is already in your living room? Meanwhile, in far-off Italy, a then-obscure director named Sergio Leone decided it would interesting to re-imagine the American western against an Italian backdrop. All the actors would speak Italian, which would later be dubbed over into the language of the country the film was playing in. Except for the main actor, who in this case was an ex-pat American named Clint Eastwood. Eastwood's TV series RAWHIDE had just cancelled and his career was effectively over. So,. when offered a few grand to be the only English-speaking actor in a ""spagetti western"" Eastwood agreed, and then forgot the experience. Until he later heard that the film, A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, had become the #1 film in Europe. But that is yet another story for yet another day... The original film DJANGO was one of the literally dozens of knock-offs of the Leone films, which (as said) were themselves knockoffs of American westerns. It starred Franco Nero, an Italian actor who spoke no English. It was hardly a prime example of the genre. It was hardly a prime example of anything. The more interesting story, a story that will fascinate film historians in the years and decades to come, is why one of the most honoured and respected film-makers on the planet today, a man whose work is actually studied in FILM SCHOOL, felt compelled to do a remake of one of the most forgettable films in the history of the medium...? This reviewer (who, by the way, considers Spagetti Westerns from the 60s a ""guilty pleasure"" - and has actually seen almost all of them in a real theatre, with a special preference for the ones starring Lee Van Cleef) could barely make it more than half way through Django Unchained, before being overcome by nausea and an overwhelming sense of loss for the way in which these resources might have been better deployed, perhaps in a parallel universe where ""QT"" is still able to pass an ink-blot test. Make no mistake. This is not fine film-making. This is a cry for help.",
140,24 June 2013,apb216,10, Oh my Django!,"If you are a Tarantino fan, prepared to be blown out of your seat. This movie is beyond epic, so much so that it needs to invent a new word for epic. This has to be beyond a shadow of a doubt the greatest movie Tarantino has ever done (and if you've seen one QT movie you'll know what a huge statement that is) and in my opinion the greatest movie of this century. If you are sensitive to the use of the N word, this might not be something you should watch, because it reportedly gets dropped over 110 times. The actors were completely mesmerizing, with Leonardo DiCaprio outshining all of them with one simple scene. I was very happy to see Christoph Waltz play a character that didn't scare the crap out of me but by no means did that make him a soft guy in the movie. The soundtrack is phenomenal, with a perfect balance of old-timey music and newer music. The song ""Freedom"" is the best, because it sounds like a slave song but written in modern times and I love jamming out to it. Absolute, hands down, 10/10!!!",
141,7 January 2013,valiaka,1, One of the best profanity movies of the year,"After the huge success of this movie over the past few weeks I started wondering what is Tarantino's winning recipe for this movie. Was it the depiction of brutality African people were subjected to during the slavery? Certainly not, since there are movies that do a much better job in that area. Was it the spaghetti western style? Not the best one in that area either. The satirical portrayal of some characters or situations? The movie has its funny moments, but with all of my generosity I could not call it a comedy nor a satire. And then it struck me. Profanity. Profanity spiced with a few jokes and the right dose of blood spatter. Thinking back to his previous work I started to see the pattern. This recipe seems to be very successful with the audience. Why not give the masses what they want, right? That one worked for Rome too. At least for a while. It seems to me the prophecy of the movie Idiocracy regarding our society is becoming a reality much sooner than expected.",

Same for all of T's movies since Pulp Fiction where EVERY character and EVERY piece of dialogue was golden. In his more recent movies we just get glimpses of it. But it is enough for me!

Not to mention he takes down 30 people at the end of the movie by himself. They should have just called it Rambo VI. Christopher Waltz is pretty grand in it but his character makes out Germans to be this great altruistic people. Ya, uhm dude, hate to inform you of this but Germans become the worst humans in history. Personally, I think it's just too touchy a subject to make an action comedy about, but to each their own I guess. Honestly, I believe the most intriguing character of the film is the one Samuel Jackson plays as an obedient former slave to Candie/DiCaprio.

155,27 December 2012,brendanboyle8-565-346540,10," Tarantino's Best, A Must See","I know claiming ""Tarantino's Best"" is quite a statement with such films as ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Inglorious Bastards"", however I truly believe it is. Django Unchained is superb from start to finish, it's a 2 hour and 45 minute movie yet you're on the edge of your seat, eyes glued to the screen for the whole ride. It's the closest thing to a flawless movie I have ever seen. Before I continue my praise of this movie, let me say this ""the movie is not for everyone."" Clearly its rated R and it has several gruesome violent scenes, it also contains vulgar language and numerous uses of the ""n"" word. Some may claim it's excessive, but I personally appreciate how realistic it portrays the horror and tragedy of slavery. That being said, I am torn if I am more impressed with Tarantino as a writer of this movie or its director. He simply is a cinematic genius. The casting of this movie alone deserves an Oscar. Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, and Leonardo DiCaprio all put on Oscar worthy performances, and frankly, I would be astonished if they all did not win. I truly can't picture any actor on this planet being able to play any of those three roles as magnificently as these three actors did. I sum this movie into three general thirds, First: where Waltz steals the show, Second: where DiCaprio steals the show, and Third: where Foxx steals the show. I have only seen Waltz in ""Inglorious Bastards"" other than ""Django Unchained"" and he is rapidly climbing my favorite actors list. Leo is my personal favorite actor ever since his performance in ""The Departed"" and it was incredible to see him take on the challenging role as his first villain, Calvin Candie, possibly the most evil character I've ever seen in a film. Finally Jamie Foxx from start to finish played his best performance in any movie to date. Simply phenomenal. I loved how the audience sees his character evolve from a powerless slave to a confident powerful man. In addition to these three remarkable performances, Kerry Washington and Samuel L. Jackson also deliver. Washington goes through living hell yet remains a strong woman throughout. Jackson plays a very interesting role as Stephen, Leo's loyal house slave. Trust me, you will hate him yet at the same time he is hilarious. Now's a good time to mention, this movie is funny! Tarantino perfectly tosses in frequent bursts of pure laughter throughout the movie to lighten up from the serious aspects of the movie. There is one scene in particular, involving Jonah Hill and Don Johnson, which had the crowd roaring in laughter for a solid full minute. Which brings me to my next point, the cast is absurd! The rather small roles for such big actors such as Jonah Hill and Don Johnson, just shows how honored actors are taking any role no matter how small for a Quentin Tarantino film. I recognized famous actors and actresses throughout the entire movie. There is one brief scene, where I believe I even saw famous rapper ""Childish Gambino"" for literally just a few seconds as a slave in Mississippi. This movie was done perfectly to a tee; even the remarkable soundtrack caught my attention, nicely combining songs of the past with modern day songs. This movie is a western, a drama, a tragedy, a comedy, an action, a thriller, and at it's deepest roots a romance. If you haven't already, stop what you're doing and see this movie today. Whatever you're doing can wait but this movie can't. Just make sure your 17, have your license, and have a stomach for more of the most gruesome violence I have yet to see on a screen. In conclusion, I've heard rumors of Tarantino pondering the idea of retiring as a director and Oo what a sad day that would be for movie lovers like myself, but if they are true at least he's going out with one hell of a BANG!",

158,10 May 2013,Ziya90,5," This time, Tarantino's ego is over everything","Since Inglourious Basterds Tarantino's style has evolved and as a Tarantino fan, I am not very much glad about that. Unfortunately, Django doesn't feel like it is an old fashioned, classic Western in Tarantino style! It is rather an anti Western or a postmodern Western. I have not any problem with this directly, but for example by watching Kill Bill, you can get the taste of 80's karate or kung-fu movies, vigilante movies, by watching his friend, Robert Rodriguez's film Planet Terror, you can get the taste of horror B movies, exploitation movies etc. but you can't get the taste of spaghetti Westerns or old fashioned Westerns by watching Django unfortunately. One of the biggest problems of the movie is it doesn't take itself seriously, in other words, Tarantino doesn't take his movie seriously. The first half of the movie is pretty good, interesting, entertaining considering some little flaws, but especially the second half, the movie loses his appeal and becomes dull and even uninteresting at times. Before that, I want to mention that I couldn't buy the character Django itself. A slave who suddenly becomes a cool cowboy didn't work for me (in contrast with The Bride in Kill Bill) At the same time, I didn't think that Jamie Foxx added anything special to the character or to the film and as a cast choice, he was pretty bad. He was plain and simple without any spark like the movie itself. He couldn't an unforgettable figure in the movie and can't be even likable. Christopher Waltz was again the star of the movie, he steals the show from everybody, he was just great and he deserved that Oscar! I am sorry, but without him, the movie would have been almost unbearable for me. Di Caprio simply adds color to the movie without being a cartoonish villain. No word for Samuel L. Jackson. He is like a bulldozer in terms of acting! The movie was overly humorous at times like Basterds and I don't like that. Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown and even Kill Bill were serious movies even if it has a certain amount of humor or funny moments. For example, in a scene Django wears a dress (it was blue as I remember) and as if it is made for laughs! In another scene, there is a ""mask"" argument and it is like you watch a Western parody! All those harm the movie little by little. With some postmodern touches and tricks like putting modern day songs into his movie, again, Tarantino tries to be different and the most important to surprise his audiences, to amaze his audiences, but if you ask me he fails. Instead of taking old classic elements and turning those into something modern in his hands like he did in Kill Bill, in this movie, he did something different which I would define as ""anti"". Also as said, the humor harms the seriousness of his movie. In the second half, when Di Caprio gets on the stage, unfortunately, the movie doesn't get better, just the opposite, it becomes uninterested and less exciting in comparison with the long first half. When they go to Calvin Candle's place (Di Caprio), somehow the movie lost its spark and also became less entertaining. May be it is because no ""Western"" anymore in the second half, instead a drama with lots of conversations and payoff! As said, Django is not a pure Western or a modernized Western, it is more like an anti Western or post modern Western. Welcome this ""a breath of fresh air"" choice, but in the end, it isn't a great, brilliant or that impressive film. Also I couldn't get that cinema feeling that other Tarantino movies have in this movie, especially in the second half. The another big problem of the movie was sudden, exaggerating and out of place violence scenes. After a slow paced drama, suddenly, the movie turns into an extremely bloody action movie. The blood effects were looking like red paint or a kind of superficial liquid which killed my suspension of disbelief totally. This is exciting! but also very superficial, exaggerating and out of place! I had expected some realistic, old fashioned but Tarantino style action, but couldn't find it. There is not any built up tension, no character conflict, no suspense etc. I can't say that Django was a solid or subtle film. The story editing of the film was problematic either. The movie starts like a revenge movie, but couldn't fulfill that, then it becomes a road movie for a short time, but it couldn't fulfill that either. Then, it becomes a drama, later suddenly action and it goes on. Also, the last one or two minutes of the film seemed me uninviting or subfusc. Django Unchained is Tarantino's Machete, a disappointing and uneven experience.",

He put his whole heart in this movie(as he does in every movie of his) and he easily made me speechless at the end of it. This is an intense movie that not only keeps you engaged, but it also keeps you guessing. This film is genius in every aspect. Firstly, the acting is simply out of this world. Jamie Foxx was brilliant and natural at the same time in every single scene. Then, there is absolutely no one who could have portrayed, Calvin Candie better than Leonardo DiCaprio, who is a master. Christoph Waltz is such a magnificent actor who really does put his heart on the table for each film he does. The whole cast and crew did a great job in putting this movie together piece by piece. The score was in fact, one of the best parts of the film, as it kept you connected to the story at all times.

He fits the role well. Some favorite parts are the exchange with Don Johnson when they first arrive at his plantation, the first few minutes we see Sameul L. Jackson's character, and the brief conversation between Django and Betina. Not the most flowing narrative, but it kept me glued to the end.",

He is one of those actors who has such a limited range and it ultimately ends hurting whatever film he is in. Hollywood needs to figure this out. Fox is the reason I didn't see this movie in theaters. Anyway, the film is about a former slave with a gun who goes undercover as a whatever in order to save his wife from slavery. The film drags on until the halfway mark, until we finally get to meet Samuel L. Jackson's character, who almost single handedly (with some help from Leo) saves the film from becoming a snoozefest.",

The two Oscars it won are not the ones I would agree with, as This film deserved awards for the superb craftsmanship on display, more than for his wanky script and same note performance by Mr Waltz. The pleasure in this film belongs in the work of the cinema- photography, art direction, set design and melancholy acting by Jamie Foxx. I saw DJANGO twice and thought it terrific both times. The sharp editing allows the violence to be hard but appropriate and the storyline is strong. Leonardo plays it like Vincent Price channeling Snidley Whiplash, and quite camp. Terrific credit titles upfront, lots of 'spot the B grade actor' fun and a nice joke with Franco Nero. Outstanding atmosphere, realistic tension and quality work on the screen make this a major work by someone who might finally have grown up a bit.

179,10 January 2021,a_chinn,9," Tarantino's talky, violent, and brilliant exploitation style western!","As with most Tarantino films, ""Django Unchained"" is not for all tastes. Tarantino is a filmmaker who makes films he'd like to see and his films are attuned to his own idiosyncratic tastes, which range from arthouse, to world cinema, to exploitation (both foreign and domestic), to even mainstream Hollywood. With ""Django Unchained"" Tarantino takes a wide set of influences and mashes them into one of the best revenge films of all-time (Kill Bill 1 and 2 were pretty great revenge flicks as well). The story is fairly straightforward. Jamie Foxx plays a freed slave who with the help of bounty hunter Christoph Waltz looks to free his wife, Broomhilda Von Shaft (a possible ancestor to John Shaft?), from Leonardo DiCaprio's villainous slave trading Calvin Candie (possibly Tarantino's most despicable villain since Gary Oldman's Drexell Spivey). The story is deceptively simple, but Tarantino's script is anything but. Drawing from samurai flicks, spaghetti westerns, blaxploitation flicks of the 70s, Hong Kong action films of the 80s (and that doesn't even scratch the surface), ""Danjgo Unchained"" can rightfully be called the ultimate revenge film, which builds to a bonkers climax that is as bloody as it is cathartic. Think John Woo's ""A Better Tomorrow II"" but even crazier, and that's saying something if you've ever seen's Woo's film. From the title and soundtrack, you'd think this would be Tarantino's take on spaghetti westerns, but it's better described as an ultraviolent souther gothic along the lines of ""The Beguiled"" more than it is like ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly."" Think ""Truck Turner"" as a weird west version of the southern gothic. Samuel L. Jackson in an interview described it as ""Shaft on a horse."" And the film is just absolutely brutal at times. That ""Mandingo Fighting"" has to be one of the bloodiest fist fight scenes ever committed to film (reportedly there was an even more violent of version, but Tarantino rightly cut it, out of fears it would negatively impact the tone of the film). With his usual flair for eclectic casting, the film features a terrific cast that includes Samuel L. Jackson (""Pulp Fiction""), Walton Goggins (""The Hateful Eight""), Dennis Christopher (""Face to Black""), James Remar (""The Warriors""), Kerry Washington (""Little Fires Everywhere""), Don Johnson (""Miami Vice""), Franco Nero (the original Django), Tom Wopat (""Dukes of Hazzard), Don Stroud (""Coogan's Bluff""), Russ Tamblyn (""High School Confidential""), Bruce Dern (""The Driver""), M.C. Gainey (80s character actor), Jonah Hill (""Superbad""), Lee Horsley (""Matt Huston""), Robert Carradine (""The Big Red One""), Tom Savini (""Dawn of the Dead""), John Jarratt (""Wolf Creek""), and Zoe Bell (""Grindhouse""), there's really no excuse for Tarantino fans to miss this excellent western revenge flick! FUN FACT! During the filming of one of the dinner scenes, Leonardo DiCaprio had to stop the scene because he was having ""a difficult time"" using so many racial slurs. Samuel L. Jackson then pulled him aside telling him, ""Motherf----r, this is just another Tuesday for us.""",

I'm no fan of Tarantino, but at least I could appreciate Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs (until the cop beating), most of Kill Bill 1 & 2, and two parts of Inglorious Basterds, particularly the dialogues. This one I tried to watch a second time and again couldn't go pass the 1-hour mark. Twice I've failed to even get to DeCaprio and Jackson! No interesting dialogues to be found and to hold my attention, not even Waltz'. I must conclude it's the Tarantino juvenile fans who've mostly voted here, who consider a film is great if it has, as someone else wrote, witty dialogue (""Permit me to parley with you""), excessive profanity ('nigger'), excessive violence (including testicles getting blown off), and soulful (more like retro) musical score. What about an interesting story? Am I supposed to enjoy 3 hours of killing bad guys a la Inglorious Basterds because it is supposedly politically correct? After watching an hour of Django and his friend kill all those white bastards I kind of got the idea of what the next 105 minutes would be and that I wouldn't enjoy them as I didn't enjoy the first sixty, similar to my experience with ""Wolf of Wall Street"". I'm a huge fan of spaghetti westerns, and consider Once Upon a Time in the West one of the great films, yet I do not believe Leone would sit through this one.

But, wait, I forgot, this is a savage indictment of slavery. Hahahaha. This is movie nerd Tarantino stealing other directors' ideas and painting the world in ludicrously simplistic black-and-white, in Technicolor, so that the bad guys are so detestable you'll cheer graphic violence and mass murder. This time it was slavers, last time it was Nazis, what cliché bad guys will be next? Terrorists? Vampires? In a musical homage? How long can this juvenile director keep spinning the same old blood-spattered revenge theme in a genre remake? This is not cutting edge cinema, folks. Using the N-word does not make you a daring film genius. Now if Quentin spent his multi-million budgets on a movie about, say, a father whose daughter was gunned down in a mass shooting, and goes on a killing spree at the NRA headquarters or a Hollywood studio, I'd be just as disgusted but at least I'd call him original.

203,30 June 2020,dilipbts,8, Django unchained,"Quentin Tarantino's 8th film ""Django Unchained"" is one hell of a movie. A brutal, bloody, terrifying, hilarious and awe-inspiring western disguised as a buddy movie that is so great that if John Wayne and Sergio Leone were alive now, they would've approve of this movie. It's designed to shock you, polarize you, test you and maybe even surprise you. But let me clear on this: If you are not a fan of bloody violence and the running length of 165 minutes, see a shorter movie. But if you love to see what Tarantino can do with movies like this, then you're in for a treat. Set during slavery in 1858, the movie follows Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is found by a bounty hunter disguised as a dentist named Dr. King Schultz (The always reliable Christoph Waltz) who hires him as a bounty hunter and a free man to find the Brittle Brothers. After finding them and hunting them down at a plantation run by Big Daddy (a remarkable Don Johnson), they relax for the winter only for them to go on a mission to find and rescue Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who is owned by Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) a man who runs a plantation known as Candieland. He even has a renegade slave as a servant named Stephen (A nearly recognizable Samuel L. Jackson, hidden in makeup and some prosthetics), who will have a part to play in the last half of the movie. I think Quentin Tarantino has outdone himself once again. Being in the filmmaking game for 20 years now, you can't deny and even reject his style in what he is bringing to the screen (He also has a cameo in here as well). His dialogue is like reading a book that grabs you and makes you want to know what happens next. The look and scope of the film is magnificent, thanks to a brilliant Oscar-winning cinematographer Robert Richardson and the late production designer J. Michael Riva. The performances in this film are brilliant. Having won an Oscar for ""Ray"", Jamie Foxx continues with his breathtaking performances that wows us. Here as Django, he is certainly fearless, baring his soul (and body) playing a man who is free from slavery, but can't be free by the rules and limitations of slavery. Christoph Waltz looks like he was born to be a part of Tarantino's entourage after his Oscar-winning performance for ""Inglorious Basterds"". Here, once again he brings humor and vulnerability to Dr. King Schultz. Never before have I ever seen an actor go that far and doesn't go over-the-top like Leonardo DiCaprio. As Calvin Candie, DiCaprio is certainly Oscar-worthy as a man who runs a tight ship by running a place where male slaves fight to the death and female slaves are being prostitutes and he seems to be the kind of guy to like even though he is a villain and he speaks Tarantino's dialogue like a pro. When he has a scene in which he reveals three dimples from a skull that belongs to his father, he is literally terrifying. Kerry Washington is superb as Broomhilda and Samuel L. Jackson is the real scene-stealer. The supporting cast is great from Walton Goggins, Jonah Hill, Michael Bacall, Michael Parks, James Remar, Robert Carradine to a small cameo by Franco Nero. ""Django Unchained"" has a lot of things to say about slavery and how cruel it is. But at the same time, it provides the fact that if Tarantino rearranged history by shooting Adolf Hitler to a pulp while everything blows up at a movie theater, he can do it again by having a former slave whipping a man who used to beat him and his wife. Now, that's entertainment. This movie really is off the chain. It's not only one of the most captivating films of the year, it's one of the best films of the year. Go see it, it will be worth your time. Keep in mind though, there are characters, especially Django, Stephen, Candie and Schultz that uses the N-word numerous times in this movie. That seems relevant to the time period, don't ya think?",

Apparently the premise is White people are awful and horrible and deserve to be shot (multiple times, with as much gory detail as possible) - all except the token good White guy who of course dies for his black friends in the end. Basically the entire movie is just this one black guy going on a rampage and killing dozens and dozens of ""evil"" Whites, and not much else. Booooring. ALso, the ""N"" word is tossed around like confetti throughout this overlong, underedited exhibition. It's almost as though Tarantino is trying to shock us, with the amount of violence, the amount of racism, the amount of needless gore. In the end I was just rolling my eyes and trying not to let my thoughts wander.

This is another fine example of this genre and if you take it for that, you'll be sure to enjoy the film immensely. Especially the first half is incredibly funny and Christoph Waltz shines as the incredibly subtly named ""Dr. King"" that frees Django and turns him into a bounty hunter. There's good dialogue, decent action scenes and just enough of a story to keep you entertained for almost two hours. Sadly, the film lasts for almost three and would have greatly benefited from some serious editing. At some point, I just wanted it to end, especially when Tarantino's usual gore-fest took over in the last third of the film. If you are trying to find out whether you'll enjoy the film: that's quite easy. If you like any other Tarantino film, you'll like this one.

218,20 January 2013,Willie-12,7, Very Tarantino...And Yet This Time That Was Part Of The Problem,"Well I finally saw Django Unchained last night, and I've got some good things to say and some not so good things. First of all, I am a Tarantino fan...always have been ever since Reservoir Dogs. I know what to expect when it comes to his films. I expect a lot of blood, over the top violence, great dialogue, interesting characters, dark humor, and one heck of a story. And all of that was present in Django Unchained. So why do I feel like, somehow, Django missed the mark a bit. Well...and I never thought I'd ever say this about a Tarantino movie...I guess I wish he'd just restrained himself somewhat. For about 80% of DU, we have a masterpiece. At that point in the film I honestly felt that I may be watching Tarantino's best movie ever. And then something happened. Tarantino got in the way of Tarantino. And here's what I mean by that. 80% of DU is a classic buddy movie with some of the best interactions I've seen in quite sometime between characters. Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz (who, once again, gives the best performance in a Tarantino film) are brilliant. There was so much chemistry between them, that their growing friendship and partnership in the bounty hunter profession was the most authentic thing about the film. You honestly come to care for both of their characters. And don't get me wrong. There was plenty of ruthless bloodiness along the way, and as always, the violence was quite graphic. But then, with about a half hour, or so, to go in the movie Tarantino ratchets up the bloodiness to Kill Bill levels. Now, that type of exaggeration was fine in the Kill Bill movies. Heck, that type of exaggeration is fine in just about any Tarantino film except Django. Here I wish Tarantino would have pulled the reigns in. Because what was, up until that point one of the best movies I've seen in a while, just becomes more grind house, comic book-esque entertainment. Of all his films, this should have been the one where Tarantino said, ""This time I'm going to come at a film in a more serious manner."" The plot certainly lent itself to such seriousness. I'm not saying there shouldn't have been any bloody violence. On the contrary, and again because of the storyline, a lot of violence should have been expected. And it was there. But then Tarantino turns the knob up so high, that the full-blast nature of the carnage actually gets in the way of this otherwise brilliant film.

219,9 January 2021,hemreyyy,9, just wow,"The movie takes place 2 years before the civil war and begins with the slave dealers who take the slaves somewhere. Dr. King Schultz appears, he is looking for a man who can recognise three men called Brittle brothers. Dr. Schultz is not a dentist anymore, he is a bounty hunter. This is why Schultz want to find these brothers. They have bounty for their heads. One of the slaves says that I know these guys. He is no one but Django. He knows them because Brittle brothers persecuted Django and his wife. Thus Dr. Schultz and Django met. They make a deal which Django will be a free man after he helps Schultz to find these brothers. Some day Dr. Schultz learns that Django has a wife called Broomhilda von Shaft who is a house slave. After that day bounty hunting becomes a story which is about finding his wife and taking revenge. In general, the movie has original topic which keeps audience on the screen and incredible screenplay which fascinates us.
My favourite about the movie is acting. The cast is amazing even I do not have to mention about how good they are. We can feel every emotion while watching them. The fear that slaves have and how they change after they are unchained is worth to see. Persuasion skill of Dr. Schultz and how he treats to the guilty guys is impressive. Beside of this Mr. Candie's pressure with a skull was successful. Moreover, we can see Tarantino with a minor role. There are a lot of examples like these. Furthermore, musics and costumes are awesome. The people who prepared the costumes and who picked the musics are deserved to be appreciated. Literally I don't have anything that I don't like but I would like to see what happens next.
All things considered, this is a great movie with an unexpected script and gripping scenes. The movie is 9 out of 10 for me, I definetely recommend it to everyone.",
220,4 January 2014,Marc_Israel_365,7, Two Thirds of a really good film,"""Django"" is part of a story that starts out as a journey, that is both storyline heavy and cinematically appealing and but at the 2/3 mark of the film, ""Unchained"" plays out and the crash and burn effect takes over. That is also the point in the film where Christopher Waltz goes out of character. Coincidence? I think not, but despite my lack of adoration here, there are scenes that can't missed. The pre-KKK attack is a rewrite short of Blazing Saddles and every Waltz soliloquy or explanation of action bears witnessing at least twice. A Tarentino adventure always merits attention, but expectations here are planned resentments of either unfulfilled promise or, more likely, excessive non-sense. Over exposed violence served its purpose in ""Kill Bill"" and ""Inglorious Basterds"" but anti-slavery points were well made and preserved well before the blood sport took over.",

Those of you that have labelled this travesty as a ""masterpiece"" might want to go back and look up the actual meaning of that word. This ultra violent and racist film is so unbelievably awful that I cannot fathom how I sat through it all. Tarantino has been hailed as this visionary director, and how he has come across this title speaks volumes for society today. QT can spew forth many sorts of bile on how he has used this film as a metaphor for this, a homage to that, but at the end of the day a film with this much unnecessary violence and racial overtones has no place in my life. Those who also yammer on and on about what a fantastic role Christoph Waltz plays have obviously to me never ever visited a Disney Store, because he seems that his acting style would fit in nicely with that particular franchise. Samuel L Jackson is the exact same character he plays in every Tarantino film, and the less said about the rest of the cast, the better. How this absolute rubbish has been rated higher that 192 other films just staggers me. Avoid at all costs if you actually claim to be an intelligent human being!",
224,17 September 2020,dommercaldi,8, A Very Tarantino-Esque Movie Set During The Slavery Days,"Pros:
1. The set and costume design is fantastic as they're well-designed and incredibly intricate.
2. The score and soundtrack add a fresh and lively feel to the film.
3. The blood and gore is amazingly gory and devastating, thus adding more weight to those moments.
4. The comedy is expertly placed, and it never out-stays its welcome by confusing the tone.
5. Both Jamie Foxx (Django) and Christoph Waltz (Dr. King Schultz) have brilliant chemistry together.
6. Christoph Waltz, Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio (Calvin Candie), and Samuel L. Jackson (Stephen) deliver great performances.
7. The cinematography is really beautiful with the zoom-ins doing a wonderful job at adding to the tension.
8. The dialogue, as usual with Quentin Tarantino, is mesmerisingly and intelligently crafted - especially with Dr. King Schultz.
9. The action scenes are thrilling, well-shot, and amazingly choreographed.",
225,2 January 2013,cultfilmfan,7, Django Unchained,"I've often felt that when Quentin Tarantino directs his own scripts the results are for the most part huge successes for critics and his admirers as well. When he has written something like Natural Born Killers, or True Romance, both of which were directed by other directors, they had some mildly interesting moments, but for the most part did not work. Here we have Django Unchained, which he has both written and directed and while I am a Tarantino fan, I have to be honest and say that it is the weakest, or at least one of the weakest of his films as a writer and a director. I was a little torn and undecided exactly what to say in this review because there were certainly parts of this new epic that I really admired and considered to be quite well done. On the other hand, there were parts that were terrible and an ordeal to sit through which made the film feel uneven and the 2 hours and 45 minutes of the film dragged, I mean really dragged. I could understand that he wanted to revisit familiar territory and make a spaghetti western with a combination of a blaxploitation film thrown in as well. Whether you like Tarantino, or not, you will have to admit that a lot of his ideas and concepts are borrowed from older, or basically other people's films. He seems to repeat and show the same type of story lines, dialogue and style in almost all of his movies, which I guess is paying off due to the high box office grosses of the films and also the numerous award nominations as well. Django, did not work because it tried to do too many things at once and on almost all accounts it failed. There were times when it tried to be humorous and it tried to set up a gag, or a punch line for amusement, but those scenes just felt so out of place and it didn't seem like Tarantino knew what he was writing and the actors often seemed clumsy and having difficulty delivering these lines and scenes. Instead of being interesting, or funny, or humorous as it's intentions were it just felt painfully awkward and like scenes that belonged in another way different type of film. I know I have criticized others droning on about the length of one's film before, but this time I can not excuse Django Unchained, because it's pacing and timing was all over the place and felt like an editing mishap and overall a mess. We have so many scenes that just do not work because they are written and performed awkwardly and they don't seem to have any clear purpose, or reason for being in the film other than to use up time. Take director Michael Cimino for example. Heaven's Gate has a scene that lasts a very long time when they are at the character's university early on in the film. The scenes goes on for a very long time, but has little to say and has no real relevance, or has any point, or purpose being in the film. It just drags. Same with his The Deer Hunter, which I like considerably more than Heaven's Gate, but what about the wedding scene in that film? The same thing. It goes on without any real purpose, or anything relevant to say. That is one of Tarantino's big problems with Django Unchained, it is almost like he wrote a bunch of ideas down on cue cards and when it came time to pulling together a script, he had to use every single last idea, note, or brainstorming idea he had and put them all in this film whether they worked, or not, or even made the film seem messy and jumbled. He didn't really seem to care. I have nothing against long films, or even films that have slower scenes in them, but they have to offer some kind of benefit to the film, the story, or the overall experience of the film. If not, having them in there just makes the film long, ambiguous and tiresome. There were things I liked about Django Unchained, particularly the supporting performances by Christoph Waltz (who continues to shine after Inglourious Basterds), Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. They are all at the top of their game here. One thing I really missed in this film that is more evident in other Tarantino films, is his flare for dialogue. My favourite scene of the whole film is where the main characters are sitting at a dinner table and Tarantino, creates tension and a mood because of his great knack of dialogue, what the characters say and getting these great actors to play it. I wish there had been more scenes like that in the film, but unfortunately there were not. The action scenes this time seemed a little too over the top and corny and a lot of the film did too, which further made me wonder what type of a mood Tarantino was going for. A lot of it just really seemed like they were trying to ham it up and be ridiculous, but those scenes were followed by others of extreme brutality and gruesomeness that didn't work either. I continue to admire Tarantino as a writer and filmmaker and while Django Unchained had a few honourable merits, there were not enough for me to call this a great film, or make me want to see it again.",

Rick pulls out a .45 and shoots Strasser in the head, blowing his guts and brains all over the airport. He tosses a shotgun to Victor who blows another Nazi in half. The pilot of the plane sees this and starts turning the plane toward Rick to mow him down with machine guns; but Rick takes out his bazooka and sends a missile into the plane, blowing it to smithereens. Rick turns to Ilsa, blood splattered all over his face and clothes and mutters, ""Get the F— outta here!""

236,24 July 2013,michaelRokeefe,9, Understatement:weird western!,"A wacky, weird western from writer/director Quentin Tarantino. A much anticipated movie that seems to satisfy all expectations. Not much is held back with Tarantino in charge of this modern-day spaghetti western. Strong graphic violence and unlimited use of the N-word. Beautiful scenery and over-the-top realistic situations in a sadistic manner in this antebellum era story about the rugged Old West and very Deep South. An impressionable and strong minded slave called Django(Jamie Foxx)is freed to trek across the country with a determined bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz(Christopher Waltz). Django is actually trained by the former dentist to be a deputy bounty hunter with the sole purpose of finding his wife Broomhilda(Kerry Washington), who is actually a favorite slave of cruel plantation owner Calvin Candie(Leonardo DiCaprio). Vicious fighting, a fair share of nudity, no-holds barred language makes for a strong raw R rating; you shouldn't expect any less from Tarantino. Of course, Foxx gets most of the publicity; but I think it is DiCaprio, who steals the show. Other players include: Samuel L. Jackson, James Remar, Walter Goggins, Dana Gourrier, David Steen and Nicole Galicia.",
237,1 January 2013,erbeme,6, Went for Tarantino. Was let down.,"Tarantino's name was enough to get me to the theater. And his trademarks are noticeable throughout--from the spaghetti western style opening to the use of varied musical styles. I was let down, however, by the film as a whole. There were multiple instances of long, drawn out scenes that seemed to be intended for style and emotion, but resulted in a pointless, tiresome straying from purpose. And character development was sorely lacking. Chris Waltz's cold, methodical, calculating, bounty hunter is all-of-a-sudden nauseated by witnessing death at the teeth of dogs. But he shouldn't have been. His character should have seen it coming. And he certainly shouldn't have so openly quivered. I think the intent was to strengthen the Django character at that time, but it wasn't believable. Also unbelievable was the ultimate climactic scene where DiCaprio and Waltz barter for Django's wife. The movie hinges on this conflict, but it was a farcical clash since either party could/would have gladly resolved the dispute. Candie would have gladly taken $12k for the ""$300"" girl. And the Dr. would have gladly paid for what they came there for in the first place! I understand that pride and besting one's opponent comes into play, but it's not believable that either man would have sacrificed themselves at that point of limited personal investment. The scenery and costumes were as good or better than other Tarantino ventures, but I felt the lack of the signature Tarantino dialogue. Maybe the argument over the eye holes cut into the masks of the raiding party approaches the Reservoir Dogs argument over tipping waitresses, but that was sadly about all.",
238,26 October 2022,unclesamsavage,8, Extremely Exciting,"Tarantino is a showman of violence and his style does not stop in this Western installment of his filmography. The shoot 'em up gore and dark humor are characteristic as well. While some may find the violence deplorable, it will surely excite those others who don't. The characters here are unique and well written, although Christoph Waltz seems to reprise Col. Hans Landa from Inglourious Basterds as a bounty hunter. I have a lot of fun watching this, especially in the company of other guys wanting some over-the-top action and a load of hearty laughs.

Okay, that's hard to sincerely while that screenplay picture is there, but I really do mean it. Django's character makes everything even better. He is definitely a hero, but he's slightly complicated hero. Usually roles like that are made for white actors, but there's no way to make this story about a white man. There are too few heroes that aren't just white men, especially when we're talking about roles where the hero is forced to act against his beliefs. Meaning Django had to pretend to be a black slaver, and he did his part and seemed almost merciless, and even when you know that's just for his plans, it is awful to watch. ",

It seems like he did in the form of Django Unchained. If you're a big Taratino fan, this film will deliver. While it features lots of violence and blood, the film often stays light-hearted because it has lots of comedy here. Taratino still has his knack for dialogue and he the script he wrote is just amazing and the dialogue is just perfect.",
264,14 April 2013,cosmo_tiger,8, Tarantino's best movie. Foxx and Dicaprio are great in this. A few cringe worthy scenes but I highly recommend. I say A-.,"""You want to save your wife by doing what I do? This is what I do, I kill people and sell their corpses for cash."" Django (Foxx) is a slave being moved to a new plantation when dentist/bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz finds him and frees him needing his help on a bounty. After getting to know each other they strike up a deal, work together for the winter making enough money so they can buy and free Django's wife from her owner. I will start by saying that I have thought Tarantino's movies are good but I am not a huge fan. Unlike most I think Reservoir Dogs is his best, not Pulp Fiction but overall I think he is a little overrated. I was looking forward to seeing this one mainly because of Jamie Foxx. About halfway in I started to change my opinion. This is far and away Tarantino's best movie. The writing is fantastic and the style is defiantly him with a few cringe worthy moments but this is a movie that I really enjoyed and I highly recommend. Foxx is great in this and DiCaprio plays such a good bad guy that he should get more roles like this. The only bad thing I have to say about this is that it is a little long, but it does hold your attention for the most part and this is one of the best movies of the year. Overall, Tarantino's best movie and I highly recommend this...if you can handle it. I give it an A-.",

Today I woke up at four AM, worked all day, got back home more beaten than usual, are something, played three hours log movie, and I saw it through without blinking. Enough said. I wonder if Tarantino knows how to make a movie that is not fantastic. So far, I didn't rate any below nine out of ten. I will not analyze this one because it is perfect in every aspect. I just want to mention the music. The music is, in my opinion, totally inappropriate for the genre, place and time in which the story is set, and often for what is happening on the screen, and it very distinctly stands out from the film. On the other hand, music is excellent and fiercely enhances the effect of the film. The music is in a perfectly harmonious discord. Madness.",

Today's Hollywood directors will never in a million years rival the visionary genius of Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah, although Tarantino has had a darned brilliant try and has in in the case of this particular movie, succeeded. As everyone knows, Django Unchained isn't a Spaghetti western, rather a profound love letter to my personal favourite sub-genre which borrows heavily from the ideas and execution of certain films within that sub-genre. Tarantino, being the expert he is in Italian cinema as well as a true Spaghetti western aficionado, is probably the only individual in Hollywood who can create a western which echoes the polished ability of Leone, Castellari and Corbucci and hence introduces a younger audience to such amazing movies.",

283,29 December 2012,Geeky Randy,7," Even from a critical standpoint, at least 75% of the film is terrific and most shortcomings are only skin deep.","Spaghetti Western—or is a Spaghetti Southern more appropriate?—about slave-turned-bounty hunter Foxx and companion/mentor dentist-turned-bounty hunter Waltz making their flesh-for-cash living, ultimately ending up at the Candyland Plantation to rescue Django's estranged wife Washington. Very much a Tarantino film, delivering homages to the genre in the same manner as ""KILL BILL: VOL. 2"" and ""INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS""; however, this addition to Tarantino's impressive filmography as director/writer is possibly the least dialogue-driven, even more so than ""KILL BILL: VOL. 1"". To some who did not care for or are not familiar with ""RESERVOIR DOGS"" and ""PULP FICTION"", this may not be a disappointment. On the other hand, viewers/fans who are very much familiar with Tarantino's style of making full use of his actors' words, expressions and interactions—a style which has gained him much praise—might be slightly let down that ""DJANGO UNCHAINED"" is more about visuals and less about emotion. Well-acted, with plantation owner DiCaprio and his head slave Jackson offering the most memorable performances. Foxx is great, but delivers an interchangeable performance; and Waltz is more than charming, but his talents are put to very similar use as in ""INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS"". Neither Foxx nor Waltz should be criticized as they obviously gave it their best; perhaps the problem is that the two lead roles are two-and-a-half-dimensional characters—not quite two-dimensionally dull and not quite three-dimensionally gripping they are both caught in that invisible world between script and screen. The film's flaws are not quite apparent until the climatic sequence, a point of the film that changes from slick and stylish to complete sloppiness. Did they use red dye and varnish for the blood or what? But even from a critical standpoint, at least 75% of the film is terrific and most shortcomings are only skin deep.",

I was pleased with the actors who were very convincing in their roles. Jamie Foxx was a very brave and mean Django, but you wanted to see him win out. In a sense, Christopher Waltz was there for decorative purposes, but he, as King Shultz, was able to get his job accomplished. Leonardo DiCaprio, as Calvin Candie unlike the loving, caring person he was in ""Titanic"", was a mean and heartless plantation owner who loved to see brutal fighting. Kerry Washington, as Bronhilda Van Shaft, was a very appealing lady, and whose heart would not go out to her? Samule L.

It should've been a sure-fire winner. I think my disappointment with Django is entirely due to my mountain high expectations. I expected it to blow me away every second, hold me in its palm like Basterds and take me off guard. Unfortunately, while it's still great, it can be predictable, it can be slow and it can be contrived. Sometimes it follows similar circumstances as Basterds and it simply doesn't build or payoff any suspense. It's a shame that these moments aren't as great as I expected, with the evilness of the antagonists being over-hyped especially. I still love the concept but it was approached in a way which although I kind of expected, I hoped it would grow from there. It's a sloppy film and revels in excess from beginning to end. I need to give it another viewing with adjusted expectations as the film certainly works as a homage but not as what I wanted it to be.

313,29 January 2013,blackprojectionist,1," Toxic Shock coupled with some Good performances, but ultimately poisonous!","It's taken me a while to write this review. There was so much hype for Quintin Tarantino's latest film, Django Unchained! My disappointment in the film was so overwhelming, that it sent me reeling into a week-long depression. When I watched the trailer, it looked like it would be a good movie. Then I saw Spike Lee's reaction, and it had me reconsider. I began doing some research, watching some of the films that influenced Tarantino, one of his favorite films, ""Mandingo"" and the Norman Wexler penned Sequel to ""Mandingo,"" ""Drum."" ""Drum,"" is almost the same film with Ken Norton in the same role for Norton, basically. These films made a lot of money. Interestingly, Norman Wexler went on to write the hugely popular ""Saturday Night Fever."" So, it's no secret that the Blaxploitation film Movement of the 70's was heralded by white writers and directors who's stereotypical notions of ""blackness"" blend savage and often extremely violent depictions of black life, and cash in big at the box office. Does it sound familiar I also re-watched some spaghetti westerns, westerns that were shot in Italy and Spain by Italians, sometimes with a few American actors, on very low budgets and often scoring with a huge profit margin at the box office. I watched ""Death Rides A Horse,"" and the original, ""Django,"" is also available in its entirety on you tube. Then I think I made the mistake of reading Tarantino's original script. The original script has a very long, brutal gang rape scene of Django's wife Broomhilda, played by Kerry Washington, and in the original script, Django is murdered in the end. So I went into the screening expecting to be completely outraged, but also feeling excited that Hollywood had made a film so offensive to the Black community, that there would be outrage and it could possibly spark a new wave of filmmakers making much better films about our history and current state of being. Nope! The film has been reviewed and reviewed and reviewed, so I'm going to get right to the point. My problems with the film are this: 1.) The n-word is used 110 times. 2.) Django, played brilliantly by Jamie Foxx, can only become heroic with Dr. King Shultz, played by Christoph Waltz, the white savior character's help and belief in him. 3.) Absurd graphic violence, heads exploding, a slave being torn apart by dogs, a woman being shot and sent flying back 20 feet... this is all just bad taste in my opinion. Things are so much more powerful when they're suggested and not shown graphically... 4.) They put my man Sam Jackson in black-face to play the ""uncle tom"" character. Damn! He isn't dark enough already? He has to be darker to play more evil? What's up with that? 5.) Broomhilda, Kerry Washington's character had like six lines in the whole film. What? A sister don't have no opinions or responses to share? Jesus... it was like a non-part for an actor of her caliber. They could have just gone ahead and cast a video vixen if they just wanted a mannequin. 6.) The depiction of the slaves is generally of an ignorant, slouching, defeated characters. Slavery was brutal, especially in this country in the south, but it's been documented by historians from the period like Pierre De Vaissiére and Baron De Wimpffen that enslaved Africans were extremely intelligent, crafty, clever, resilient, powerful human beings. 7.) Slaves fighting to the death is a complete fabrication, created by a racist lens in the slave narrative films of the 70s and made more graphic in this film. 8.) The overall experience of watching the film was unpleasant. The actors are good, the soundtrack is good, but the tone of the film was drenched in a certain vulgarity and void of soul quality that I found offensive. 9.) The scene where Django is about to have his balls cut off, I felt, was a mental castration to the Black men in the audience. 10.) The fact that folks in the small town in Texas were outraged by seeing Django riding a horse was completely ridiculous as it's pretty well known that between 15 and 25% of cowboys were Black. 11.) I see audiences reactions often being somewhat racist, depending on who's in the theater. If it's a predominantly white audience, they laugh at things like Django putting on a top hat. What's so funny about that? Top hats were in style back then, suckers! There is a lot of laughter for white audiences and very quiet reflection by Black audiences. 12.) I could go on and on... but I won't. So, overall, I felt like the film is extremely toxic for young viewers, gives a distorted sense of history, was bad taste and has gotten a lot of undue praise. Django Unchained creates some satisfaction for Black folks who see a brother kicking butt and not taking any crap from white folks, killing many of them brutally, often in cold blood and it's an outlet for our collective rage... to a degree. White people who watch the film get to feel morally superior to those backwards slave holders via the German bounty hunter who has a much greater command of the English language than that native speakers in the film. What is the effect of all this graphic violence on our minds? I'm one to believe its part of why there are so many shootings in this country. Seeing 300,000 murders on TV and in the movies by the time we're 18 years old can only make such violence seem like one of our options of behavior. Does this film open the dialog for a discussion of slavery in this country? Perhaps for some. But ultimately I feel like it does more harm than good.",

This movie, like any other Quentin Tarantino movie I've seen, is simply terrible to the point of being farcical. Watch it only if you're into dark humor, rather than a good story. From the over use of blood during the ending gun battle, to the bullet that is so powerful as to slide its victim into the next room, to Jamie Foxx's use of sunglasses in a setting before they were even invented, to Tarantino's usually pointless cameo, this movie and it's story were barely believable. That this movie won 2 Oscars only speaks to the motion picture academy's lack of judgement and taste.",

It was a genger obviously but but all of the acting was just so phenomenal and the actions little and the action seems worth just oh my God they were perfect in every kind of way It was a perfect Movie.,

319,3 January 2013,KineticSeoul,8, Probably the most action packed Tarantino film,"This is a southern/Western that compacts quite a bit of action, good dialogues and superb acting although it can be slightly over the top. But that is Quentin Tarantino's characters trademark. But in a way it lacks some strong substance that is in Tarantino's early movies and seemed to rely a bit more on the violence than a well better crafted characters. The characters are memorable to a degree but just lacked substance and the motives and why they strive for it to such a extent isn't all that clear. But in past Tarantino movies it's like that but it had better dialogues. Also the violence in this movie didn't seem well grafted into the story and scenarios while not leaving that big of an impact. I wouldn't say pointless but it has been done better in previous Tarantino films and way more memorable. I am not sure if Tarantino got some ideas from ""Sukiyaki Western Django"" a Takashi Miike film that Tarantino made a cameo appearance in. Which is a really western comic book style movie and although ""Django Unchained"" is better some scenarios seemed slightly similar. Unlike previous Tarantino movies though this one doesn't go in a messed up orders from what happens story wise but goes in a chronological order with few flashbacks. Some of the few characters that has strong presence in this movie is Django Freeman(Jamie Foxx) who is the least interesting one although he is the main character. But still glad Will Smith didn't get this role. Dr. King Schultz(Christoph Waltz) who plays a fake doctor bounty hunter who oppose slavery and no not the shoe doctor. Christoph Waltz nailed it as the Jew Hunter in ""Inglourious Basterds"" and he really stands out in this one as well. Than there is Calvin J. Candie(Leonardo DiCaprio) who is this really evil and sadistic slave owner on a plantation called Candyland. In fact his character appear more ruthless than the Jew Hunter although the Jew Hunter probably killed more jews. But Candie's certain actions makes him appear like a really ruthless prick. And DiCaprio pulls it off, I don't know but he always does a fine job with these ambitious business like characters that is full of way too much pride. Samuel L. Jackson is also in this and he plays a brown noser for Calvin Candie but he is a badass brown noser if there is one and he has the most keen sighted character in this movie although despicable. But I can fully understand how some audiences would be offended by this character. What is interesting is how Django and Dr. King Schultz show there relationship in a way where Django is the dominant one to Calvin J. Candie. But behind closed door it's Stephen who is the dominant one to Calvin J. Candie. Stephen sorta reminded me of Uncle Ruckus from ""The Boondocks"" and wouldn't be shocked if Quentin got his inspiration for one of his character from Uncle Ruckus. Another character that some viewers of that show would find offensive. Don Johnson also stands out a bit as a racist plantation owner that goes by Big Daddy although he doesn't have that many scenes. Despite few flaws this movie seemed to pass by pretty quickly although it's almost 3 hours long and wasn't bored with it at all.",
320,26 December 2012,cattjones,8, Off the Chain,"Quentin Tarantino has out-done himself on some of the most violent scenes that I have ever seen on the big screen. This film shouldn't be called Django Unchained; it should have been called Tarantino Unchained. There were times during the film that I just could not watch what was happening. On the other hand there are also some very funny moments; mostly delivered by Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz). As seen in the trailer, the doctor needs help in finding some criminals with a very high price on their heads; however he has never seen them. He enlists Django (Jamie Foxx) to help him hunt these men down and soon fully employs him as a bounty hunter. In exchange, the good doctor will help Django to retrieve his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from the mega-plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Running the ""big"" house on Mister Candie's plantation is Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) who is as loyal as they come and disturbingly dedicated to his master. Django is totally transformed from a down-trodden slave to a self-reliant pistol carrying sharp shooter. I also just want to say that there has been so many films where Germans have been portrayed as the ""bad guy"" so it was refreshing to see one that was a good guy. I would be remiss if I did not mention Big Daddy (Don Johnson) who somehow made me think about fried chicken because they dressed him up to look a little bit like Colonel Sanders. The violence in this film is not the only shocking moments; there are some things that are better left not shown (you'll know exactly what I mean once you see the film). It seems like really long movies are starting to become the norm and this film is no exception, although you are so engaged in what is going on in the film that this one did not feel that long. This is a true Tarantino film and you will get exactly what you expect (and then some). In classic Tarantino fashion, he takes you from one extreme (disgust) to the other extreme (laugh out loud funny). This spaghetti western will definitely take you on a roller coaster ride for sure, so buckle up. Even though there were times that I was shaking my head and turning away from the screen, I am going to give this film a green light.",

Few can outdo him for over the top blood and guts treatment of a subject matter that is inherently not funny. He knows how far he can push the limits and gathers together some very fine talent in all aspects of his creation. DJANGO UNCHAINED is certainly one of his finest efforts to date, and that is saying a lot.

Indeed, when interviewed a few years back, Quentin Tarantino expressed his ambition to be known for the guy who makes the best revenge movies; well, he certainly does revenge with flair. Being a walking talking encyclopedia of movies, Tarantino has studied the movies and the audiences reaction and he plays to those very well. He also loves to make small homage to movie makers that have influenced him in one way or another and in Django Unchained, he used the theme of the 60's original series of Django movies; even Franco Nero, the original Django in the 1966 movie that bears the name title, has a role in this Tarantino movie.",

Dejango just had this aggressive feeling to it with all the action scenes and all the blood. That kind of feeling really makes me get into a movie. Dejango the main character is black so he isn't treated as well as the white people because this movie was taking place so long ago, slavery was still there. But he finds a wealthy white person who is nice to him and takes care of him you could say. I really enjoyed that within the movie. My favorite part is the last scene it's so intense with some dark humor and It is very bloody it's the best scene in the movie. Overall dejango was an amazing movie.",

329,13 February 2013,PeterMitchell-506-564364,9," Another mouth dropping, eye popping Tarintino experience","Once again, the Tarantinster has excelled himself, his latest cinematic event, centered around slavery. Slave, Foxx, is freed of his chains, by Waltz, again turning in a great performance as a mysterious doctor. In return, he wants something- a guide. Waltz's one hell of a gunslinger, his title occupation, a front for his real activities as a bounty hunter, that's indeed profitable. This has much more violence than you would expect, as judged by Tarantino's previous showings. That's after his first Kill Bill. We charter new territory here, the slave aspect, working better than other anti slavery movies of past. Think Drum and Mandingo. Here Foxx and Waltz partner up, Foxx in a quest to find his beautiful black wife, (Kerry Washington) who's been sold to a slave plantation. Ruthless, slave owner, De caprio, playing bad, really good, takes them there, where Foxx, must steal her away from the notorious Candiland. Catchy. Samuel L Jackson, one of those truly underrated actors, is great and funny, as the bigoted butler of this house, who always sucks up to De Caprio, if reiterating his points. The Tarintino humor is back, as is lashings of violence in plenty supply, the cracking sound of those whips, making us appreciate something we'll gladly never have to endure. We too have some close up shots, when involving ailments, that almost made me want to take up beer drinking. The shootout scenes, some that catch us by surprise, are brilliantly staged, where some of you viewers may need to have some stomachs on this violent journey. The performances of nearly every actor in this film are so good, some who you first won't recognize, Don Johnson in particular, who runs one slave plantation early in the film. Some you don't recognize at all, until reading the end credits, where you'll end up saying ""Hang on, who were they?"" We're talking some veteran actors too, who haven't been on the cinema screen for yonks. Tarantino as a mining company worker dons an Aussie accent that does keep slipping, but when it doesn't, it was quite impressive, it'll catch you by surprise, some of his dialogue gets lost under his trying efforts. Sorrily, Aussie Jarratt, is the worst actor in this, openly using an Aussie accent, with his character that's made him look like a d...head in other films. As highly anticipating a piece of acting, that would blow me away, accent, too, I was clearly despondent, thinking ""What, are you kidding me""?

I remember some uproar it caused when it was first released - some composers and actors refused to work with Quentin Tarantino ever again. Many people were upset about the violence and how slavery was depicted. Tarantino has stated himself that he later re-edited some scenes to tone down the violence. My personal opinion is that he made the right choice. Not that I can't stomach the violence (on the screen), but on some occasions the horrors we can't see can have a bigger impact. The scene with the runaway slave and dogs - when we hear the screams of the victim from the background while we see into the cruel eyes of Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin Candie - it is haunting. As it is a Tarantino movie, one can expect over two hours long well-paced epic with magnificent dialogue and scene-setting. The acting is perfect with many actors doing some of their best jobs here. The balance between some of the quiet performances and that perfect little notch of over-the-top is just fantastic.",

While this movie is long I didn't feel it and I didn't get that sense of him just having characters talk just to talk so he can hear the dialogue he wrote for himself. Basically QT is a kid who uses actors to reenact his favorite scenes from other movies he loves. I do believe he redeemed himself a little , because I was getting sick of him and his indulgences. I think he gets too much credit for doing stuff other actors get hanged, poor choice of words, for. I think Edgar Wright is a much better director and will soon pass him and hopefully get more credit. Now that said I'm going to try my hardest to make more sense then this movies tone.",

340,14 March 2021,judemcrobbie,9, Nearly his best...,"Personally what separates this movie from other western/revenge/race pieces, Tarantino or otherwise, is the cast. In this case you can't imagine Django as anyone but Jamie Fox, Dr. King Schultz as anyone other than Christoph Waltz etc. The only performance in this that I will not take with me until I die is Kerry Washington as through a lack of lines and not being stellar like the other 5 main characters. Speaking of which, I think this might be my favourite Leonardo DiCaprio role yet. He's incredible in The Revenant etc, but the level of depth he brings to Calvin Candie through less than an hour of screen time in tantalising and an insatiable watch.
If you think of a badass movie it's this. It has everything. Firstly, a killer plot about revenge and ultimately love. Secondly, the best use of blood in any movie I've seen, somehow using it both comically and to hammer the point in at the same time.
Tarantino films are special. From what I can tell, ever since reservoir dogs was released so many films have tried to do their best to be a Tarantino film, but so far none have the quippy dialogue and balls-to-the-Wall flare of him. Django is no different. In many ways it feels the same way as untouchables, taking this extremely volatile topic, of 1800's slave trade and racism, and making it a genuine delight to watch and one of the funniest Tarantino films.
There are a plethora of points I'd like answers to but will never get them, which will in turn keep this in my mind. These just add to the Tarantino magic, just like the briefcase in pulp fiction.
Do I think it's his best? No way. Pulp Fiction is better than this by a long shot in my opinion, and his final movie is going to have to be a masterpiece to beat it, but do I think it's 2nd? Probably, it's either that or reservoir dogs to me.",

Don't get me wrong,Pulp Fiction is his first masterpiece as well as the movie he made him famous and different than the other directors but Django is not only full with great action/drama and comedy scenes but also the cast is beyond spectacular,the soundtrack is beautiful and in some way,the story of ""Django"" is a bit better than the one from ""Pulp Fiction"".
Besides Jamie Foxx and Christoph Walts,I really loved Leonardo DiCaprio because his character makes you speechless and it is also the greatest villain he ever played in his entire career.
Honesty,after rewatching all of Quentin Tarantino's films I can say that,besides ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Inglourious Basterds"", Django is my favorite film of Tarantino and it sure is better than ""Once Upon A Time...in Hollywood"".
I hope that Tarantino will continue Django story with his sequel called Django/Zorro.

After all, Ford all but made the American western genre his own, from early silents such as The Iron Horse (1924), to well-established classics like My Darling Clementine (1946) and The Searchers (1956), he brought critical adoration to a genre that was then seen as nothing more than popcorn cinema. But Tarantino hates John Ford, to quote - ""to say the least, I hate him [...] It really is people like that that kept alive this idea of Anglo-Saxon humanity compared to everybody else's humanity."" So, in Django, do we have a post-modern, anti-Ford American West, where a freed black slave is the hero, and the White Man the devil? Well, kinda. But this is Tarantino, and from what was clear from his previous film Inglourious Basterds (2009), he doesn't do things the regular way.",

353,27 December 2012,meeza,10, Do the Django and watch this Tarantino instant classic!,"DMeeza (and yes, the ""D"" is silent) is about to write a review of one his favorite movies of 2012, ""Django Unchained"". Quentin Tarantino returns with another immensely entertaining ""history rewrite"" film with the Django. This spaghetti-western movie stars Jamie Foxx as Django, a black slave who is confronted by a Dentist turned Bounty Hunter named Dr. King Schultz in order to help him locate some outlaws who are next on Dr. Shultz' Bounty hit list. Dr. Shultz takes a liking to Django's bravado & demeanor and eventually they team up as Bounty partners. Django's ultimate desire is to reunite with his slave wife Broomhilda who was sold to the Candieland plantation in Mississippi. Candieland is owned by the condescending Calvin Candie, who thrives in watching slaves fight to the death in a Mandingo sport. Dr. Shultz makes a king move in helping Django reunite with his wife; his plan is to go to Candieland and for him and Django to pretend to be Mandingo aficionados in order to scheme a method to buy off Broomhilda from Calvin Candie. Of course, there is always plenty of grotesque violence, boisterous mayhem, and witty dialogue in a Tarantino flick and fortunately that is also in the menu of this spaghetti western Quentin has delighted us with; his films are in a genre of their own. Quentin is worthy of screenplay & director Oscar nominations for his ingenious ""off the chain"" orchestration and scribe of ""Django Unchained"". Foxx was one cool black cat as Django. Christoph Waltz' performance as Dr. King Schultz was just as juicy as his Oscar-winning work in Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"", but with a heroic quality to it. Leonardo DiCaprio's first premier villainous role in his performance as Calvin Candie proves that Leo is just as good playing bad as he is playing good. Tarantino favorite Samuel L. Jackson served up a meaty performance as Candie's main butler Stephen, who was just as villainous maybe even more than Candie himself; and he is black. Don Johnson delivered a vice mac-daddy cameo performance playing the negro-hating plantation owner Big Daddy. And even though she was a bit underutilized, Kerry Washington swept it up nicely thespian style as Broomhilda. ""Django Unchained"" was a chain of exemplary film-making and acting that deserves a chain reaction of praise. ***** Excellent",

His unapologetic style of film making borders on guerrilla warfare. Using non PC language, showing graphic violence and so forth. Truly makes this film more of an experience than a viewing.

356,14 March 2013,bebop63-1,6," Blood,Guts & Glory - Just The Way Tarantino Does It","Ostensibly a tribute to spaghetti Western genre of films, DU delivers the goods as far as gunplay and bloodbaths go - in the first ten minutes a man and a horse get their heads blown off. Then the body count gradually increases every 20 minutes till this almost 3 hour serious version of Blazing Saddles comes to an end. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy watching it - viewed it a second time as a matter of fact - but felt that Tarantino could have done better with a more viable screenplay and organised direction. There seems to be a lot of disjointed moments that need further elucidation - more than coincidental that the very first plantation visited happened to harbour the fugitives from justice that the main characters were seeking for. Christoph Waltz turns in a memorable performance as Dr King Schultz, German expatriate ex-dentist who speaks impeccable Oxford Dictionary style English, who has turned to bounty hunting as a calling, evidently seeing more profit in removing whole (bad) bodies than just bad teeth. He is supposed to be the good guy, but at times comes through as a self-righteous stuck-up pompous a-- who justifies his actions with pieces of legal documents (warrants) authorizing him to take down outlaws, dead or alive (preferably the former). Jamie Foxx as the eponymous character seems rather stiff and hesitant in the beginning, as if thinking what to do or say next, and only gradually comes out of his shell, as it were, much later in the film, when he's dressed ostentatiously in blue boy costume and astride a noble steed and gets to do a lot of shooting and talking. Leonardo DiCaprio is the delightfully despicable plantation owner Calvin Candie, who enjoys slave fights and black wenches, with a dialogue of high vocabulary to match Schultz's. Other characters do little more than just stand aside as living set decorations. Samuel L Jackson as Stephen is in my opinion the most unforgettable and noteworthy character in the film; he seems to revel in his role as the subservient yet outspoken black mayordomo to Mr Candie (""who dat niggah on dat nag?!""), although coming across as comical and stereotypical Uncle Tom or Stepin Fetchit, he proves to be very perceptive and astute than given credit for - as in the scenes where he correctly deduces that Broomhilda and Django already know each other previously. A lot of the movie is taken up by needless and irrelevant scenes, like the Regulators aka Bag Men (precursors to the KKK), and Django's trip to the Dickey Quint mines in the hands of 3 inept and inefficient mine minions, in which Tarantino has a bit role speaking in a rather atrocious and laughable attempt at Aussie Strine. And to the more historically savvy, there's the numerous anachronisms and factual errors to nitpick at - dynamite, drinking straws, sunglasses and the Henry Repeater rifle, to name a few. But don't let this review put you off from seeing DU. It does have its glorious moments, blood and gore and all. But as with Tarantino films, don't expect a history lesson to base your book report on.",
357,26 December 2012,EmmaDinkins,6, Chix Chat on Film Review: A new kind of western.,"I thought that the most intriguing thing about Django Unchained, was going to be figuring out how could a Black man in America during slavery possibly become a bounty hunter and most importantly would the constructed tale be plausible. Not only did Quentin Tarantino (writer/director) make it believable he made it worth sitting through the 2 hour and forty-five minute running time. Initially as seen in the trailer Django (Jamie Foxx) is requisitioned by Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) a German dentist to assist him in his current trade, from there the adventure begins and includes the task of reuniting Django with his wife. The dialogue was filled with far too many nickels for my taste, but there were consequences for its usage which shows that there is a cost for speaking ugly words. Uncle Ruckus, I mean Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) was the character that you immediately love to hate, the portrayal was so convincing that I watched him in every scene with a measure of contempt. I have become accustomed to the signature excessive blood spatters when flesh is injured typical of a Tarantino film, but the gore and carnage in this film was a bit much even for Mr. Tarantino. I guess that pushing the envelope with the savagery is his way of being explosive. This film had shocking moments that took me to the limits of disgust like the Mandingo fights and there were moments that took me to the opposite end of the spectrum by Django's love for Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). Ms. Washington is a natural beauty but her acting chops were only challenged here by anguish, I guess a man's man has a hard time thinking up what a slave woman would say so she had very little dialogue, but she did emote well. I don't know what the emotional response was that was expected from the viewing of this film, but I was left somewhere in the middle. The middle of the scale for those two extremes is indifference. The final scenes were a payoff and I especially liked the horse tricks, but I'm trying to decide if it was a big enough pay off to lean more towards favoring the story or reviling the violence. This one was difficult to gauge, it was entertaining but I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit that I laughed at some of the uncanniest things like the klan. I will linger on the middle ground with an amber light.",
358,15 January 2013,BA_Harrison,7, That's another genre ticked off.,"Quentin Tarantino has been plundering cult cinema for over twenty years now, with varying degrees of success. Django Unchained sees the director turning to the Spaghetti Western for inspiration, borrowing film-making techniques from the greats of the genre (most notably Sergios Leone and Corbucci) while adding his own trademark touches—snappy banter and over-the-top violence. The result is something of a mixed bag—some of it works brilliantly, much of it is unremarkable yet still entertaining, and some of it is embarrassingly bad. Fortunately, the positives outweigh the negatives, the overall result being far from Tarantino's best work, but a long way from his worst as well.",

Christoph Waltz's performance is the one thing that holds this whole mess of a movie together. The final ending feels tacked on for more gratuitous gore and violence. The film jumps from the foothills of California to the swamps of the deep South in the flash of an eye.

367,18 April 2015,kevinosborne_99,5, Fantasy,"I am not a weapons expert but know enough that the rifles and pistols used in the film predate their actual existence. This fact and the plot itself help turn the movie from fantasy to fantastical. For such a movie to succeed the characters had best be living in a fantastical place, which as depicted it is not. But fantastical things happen regularly, such as a man drawing while covered against a cocked shotgun and easily killing the holder without the shotgun firing. Or a derringer appearing out of a skin tight shirt sleeve, the never missed shots by the stars, the almost instantaneous transformation by a slave who had never touched a gun into Bill Hickok. All of these could be accepted, perhaps, if the depictions of just about everybody in the film did not seem slightly off key. They just don't quite fit, including the Oscar winner Waltz who unlike his perfect and even superhuman performance in Inglorious Bastards has to make ends meet with a very imperfectly written character. He does his best, the movie is well acted by DiCaprio as usual and all the secondary characters except Tarantino who by now should realize his talents do not extend to his acting. The movie plays like a bunch of parts installed to satisfy needs, rather than create a cohesive whole which is something Tarantino in Pulp Fiction, for example was brilliant at deflecting. Better luck next time.",

Yes, it has the typical plot of one trying to fight back for his girl, but it is SO much more than just that.

370,16 January 2021,Grimbleton,9, How do you like the bounty hunting business?,"My favorite Tarantino film so far, Django Unchained is a masterpiece of storytelling set in the backdrop of 1850's America where slavery is the norm. Dr. King Schultz and Django Freeman embark on a quest to enact justice upon the most wanted in the country while taking a not-so-slight detour to save Django's wife, Broomhilda. With incredibly well-shot scenes and excellent character development, Django fails to disappoint with both its deep dialogue and themes as well as its over-the-top action and blood (of which all in the film seem to be laced with gunpowder). DiCaprio as Calvin Candie, Jackson as Stephen, Foxx as Django and Waltz as Schultz present some of the best performances I've seen to date, fully embodying the good and evil of the Deep South, their facades as deep as the shallow mass graves. Touching on slavery isn't an easy thing to do, but Tarantino manages to weave these excellent personalities into the mix with fantastic dialogue that is both superficial at times but also peppered with meaning and depth. And as always, the soundtrack is wonderfully made with the help of Luis Bacalov and many others, providing a western that's on par with Clint Eastwood's greatest hits. Much like Tarantino's other films, Django Unchained fiddles with time and at first glance it may be difficult to understand the plot, but watching the film over (and over) again results in clarity befalling the viewer and the uncovering of uniquely grim, but expertly woven, metaphors that illustrate the desparity of the time.",

In this bloody Spaghetti Western, Django, a black slave, exacts his revenge on the white slave owner who bought his wife and the white people who tortured him. This scenario is so perfect for a revenge story it's almost surprising that nobody has tried this yet, but the subject of slavery is still incredibly sensitive even after 150 years.

However his latest film, the violent western Django Unchained, manages to reclaim those specific elements as he chooses to revive the 'spaghetti' sub-genre and blend it altogether with gratuitous violence as well as paying homage to several lesser-known westerns.

This movie is already the film with the most abundant and complex plot among the many western cowboy movies I have seen. Obviously, the theme of this film is freedom. The freedom of the whole film runs through the whole process. The black people have been working hard for their freedom. This reminds me of Martin Luther King. I am very moved by their constant struggle and efforts for their freedom. Of course, whether it is the leading role or the supporting role, the performance level of each actor is commendable, which can be said to be very committed, and it is easy to bring us into the story. The director chose to shoot in the United States, which vividly restored the social environment at that time, and it can be said that it is easy to bring the audience into the past. Under this premise, the story telling can be said to have a very obvious effect. Of course, this film also seems to criticize some ugly faces in the old American society, and also oppose the landlord class at that time and some things against the black people. I think that for the black people, it should be a work with very strong influence and leadership. Of course, I also like the soundtrack of the film very much. The music of the cowboy style in the early American West has passed the modern adaptation and transformation, It can be said to be very sweet and fresh.",

Great performances by every character and Tarantino comes through with a great screenplay and vision. Camera work is outstanding and the visuals are fantastic.

In ""Dead Alive"", the unlikely hero decimates zombie hordes until the screen literally floods with blood. In a way, ""Django Unchained"" (hereafter ""Django"") reflects ""Dead Alive""'s ""go nuts with killing until you stop being scared and disgusted and just have to laugh"" sensibility. As Django (Jamie Foxx) ascends from slave to bounty hunter to talented gunslinger to determined avenger and savior, the viewer is inundated with so many killings, humiliating tortures, mutilations, and explosions, he/she may stop being disgusted and overwhelmed, and simply laugh at the brutal inanity of it all.

412,26 October 2018,pfsombrero,10, Wunderbar!,"Hi, 6 years have passed since the release of Django Unchained, but since I care a lot about this movie, I decided to wait to have the right words to talk about it.
Django Unchained comes out in 2012, but since I'm not a western enthusiast I decide not to spend even a minute of my time watching the aforementioned, considering it the usual movie of ""cowboys against Indians"". In 2015, however, on the advice of friends, I reluctantly start the vision. Start, they spend a few minutes and are already open-mouthed, wide-eyed and ""stuck"" to the screen. I am immediately struck by the beauty of the music, the charisma of all the characters and the originality of the script. A ""powerful"", intelligent, flawless movie that can ""immerse"" the viewer in the plot from beginning to end. A masterpiece surrounded by the presence of formidable actors, such as: Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L. Jackson and Oscar (best supporting Role actor) Christoph Waltz. Tarantino exceeds himself in this movie, for all aspects, treating the subject of slavery in an original way is never seen and bringing back the plot to the Nordic mythology and the tale of ""Siegfried""; giving the film a touch of ""magic"" more. Nothing in this film is obvious and everything has an explanation, for every killing, from the death of ""Ace Speck"" to that of ""Calvin Candie"" and ""Stephen"" there is a plausible reason that justifies it, making this movie not turns out to be a trivial action movie. To conclude, I make the most sincere congratulations to Quentin Tarantino, for what they are worth, for writing and shooting one of my favorite movies. See you at the next review ...",
413,2 August 2015,Horst_In_Translation,6, Tarantino on slavery,"Let me start this review by saying that I am quite a fan of writer and director Quentin Tarantino. I love some of his and like almost all of his works. ""Django Unchained"" was his latest movie so far and it came out 3 years ago. Apparently he had so much fun making it that he made another western movie right afterward, which is going to come out later this year. We'll see if this one is a bit into political conflicts such as slavery as well. His film before this one here dealt with Nazi Germany, so he seems to have a tendency right now to make political films. Still, they are as outrageously over-the-top and fun to watch as his older movies. I enjoyed watching Django, but not as much as ""Inglourious Basterds"", the movie he made before that. I wish he could have won the Screenplay Academy Award for that one, even if his Django script is not weak at all either. The second Oscar for this film went to Christoph Waltz for portraying Django's loyal friend and mentor Dr. King Schultz. I thought Waltz gave a good performance here and there is some irony to it that his biggest rival for Oscar glory was probably Tommy Lee Jones (who was actually supporting in contrast to Waltz), who played a White man in another slavery-centered drama as well. Still I believe, Waltz was superior in his first Tarantino film, for which he also won an Oscar.",

Sixth, while some of the plot twists are clever, several are just ridiculous, and covered by the typical device of moving so quickly that you don't have time to consider how improbable they are. Other than the foregoing, it is pretty good- fast-paced and sometimes funny. But how can anyone be so desensitized that he/she does not appreciate how offensive and dangerous this is?

""Reimagining the Western genre for his own ends, Sergio Corbucci used cowboy pictures, and his vast knowledge of them -not to mention his expertise on Japanease samurai pictures- to explore and examine the evils inherent in fascism""; if we change the name Sergio Corbucci for Quentin Tarantino, and the word ""fascism"" for ""slavery"", we would have a great resume of what DJANGO UNCHAINED is. ",
425,10 February 2013,toqtaqiya2,6, Django Unchained certainly isn't a masterpiece but it's bold and funny for sure.,"I'm a cinephile but I wasn't looking forward to seeing Django Unchained. Still, since I had some time, I went to the theater where the film was being screened. Django Unchained is a long film. Its running time is 165 minutes. Some people say that Quentin Tarantino is a great filmmaker, so he must have filled this project with meat. But no. There's just not enough meat here to justify the long running time. Instead there's fat and plenty of it. After Inglourious Basterds (2009), which is one of his best films, Tarantino wanted to make a spaghetti western. But he wanted the setting to be the Deep South before the Civil War. So he called his project a ""Southern."" He's not the first filmmaker to twist the word. Russian filmmakers made Western-like films as far back as the 1960s. They called them ""Easterns"" or ""Osterns."" One of the best films from that genre is White Sun Of The Desert (1970). Tarantino also said that he wanted to tackle the issue of slavery in the United States because America hasn't dealt with it well. The plot of Django Unchained is a simple one. Tarantino doesn't shy away from showing some of the worst abuses that happened as a result of slavery. But he still keeps things entertaining. The actors deliver good performances, especially Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. The film contains some of Tarantino's best written dialogue. The gunfights are some of the best ever committed to film. Despite all this the film is still, for the most part, a stylistic failure. For such a simple story it's too long and there are a number of scenes which serve no purpose. Tarantino gets good performances from the actors but his direction doesn't impress because he didn't do a good job at building scenes. He's known for including things that he likes in his films. Here he goes too far by including too many of his influences and too many songs that aren't really suitable for the material. Tarantino's previous editor Sally Menke knew how to cut his footage for a good result and when to reign him in. But now that Fred Raskin is the editor the film doesn't seem like the work of a great director. So, even though the cinematography by Robert Richardson is beautiful and even though the film is entertaining we still get something that seems average but bloody as well. With better direction and better editing it could have been a great film. Django Unchained is also Tarantino's funniest film yet. I recommend it but my recommendation isn't enthusiastic.",

(Oh by the way, when QT has his cameo his doesn't use that word. He uses a different one. If that word is good enough for his cast (and his audience), why is he afraid to use it himself?) The dialogue isn't the only problem with this movie. Another problem is the length. It's way too long. It's also filled with distracting cameos, including one from Franco Nero that very few people would understand. On the plus side, this movie has a terrific performance by Jamie Foxx. It also is a great movie to look at. ""Django Unchained"" does have a few good moments here and there but, for most part, it isn't worth the trouble.",

The performances are outstanding, and it is hilarious. It is a great film. Now that I've said that, I'm going to give a little warning about Tarantino's next films. This movie has no background or message to it. It can barely support itself. If It wasn't made by Tarantino, it would be terrible. Let me explain. Why can he throw all of these racial slurs and offensive materials at us? It isn't like he's trying to prove anything. I get that he's trying to make something for the sake of it being cool, but a little heart to the film would have been good.

As much as it is a lesson on how damned the English language has become, the film, for me, makes me think again and again about influences and motivations. It's only a fairy tale, per se, but my main motivation in seeing Quentin Tarantino movies is the lesson in influences they give me. They're a cinematic history lesson directed towards pure entertainment and leave out any potential for dull moments. It also challenges any idea of ""fun"" you may have. As strong as any of his other flicks (and, more importantly, cinema in general), it is a perfect blend of dialogue and scenes propelled by a sweet soundtrack. There are some terrifying moments, one which should give Leonardo DiCaprio an Oscar nomination at least, but they aren't meant to last long, and an intense grand bloody finale is cut short to lead into another finale, as if it's a re-do, for a more satisfying conclusion. As perfectly edited as each scene is, I wonder if the last 15 minutes would have benefited better from the late Sally Menke (Tarantino's editor for the past 20 years). Not to give any spoilers, the movie gives you what you want if not what you expect. Tarantino is a master of escapist entertainment and if you're ready to take a ride away from the real world, his cinema is capable of making you feel like a kid again (meaning you are definitely NOT a child watching this film).",

464,22 March 2023,cooverknight,7," It's humorous, but the film never has a coherent thread","It's interesting that a film entitled Django Unchained, about a freed slave that becomes independent, has the major black character--played by Jamie Foxx--behaving fairly clueless throughout the film. Sure, you have to become socialized as a free man if you were a slave. While that may be accurate, it doesn't make for a compelling plot. In fact, I thought Jamie Foxx has this deadpan/confused demeanor through most of the film. The main character ends up being Dr. Schultz. In fact, Samuel Jackson's character is much better defined and more interesting than Foxx's. The film grows more and more gonzo as the story progresses, and approaches the level of slapstick. That's not necessarily bad, but it simply adds to the mixing of genres, which is also fine if it works, but it seemed to gimmickly to me. The salute to Italian westerns is fun, but Italians didn't have to contend with slavery as a serious issue--one that tore and still seems to tear apart the U. S.

Though there's no doubt that the likes of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and the like are modern classics of popular culture, they didn't necessarily demonstrate a more refined sense of wellresponsibility.

Shootouts very well done by the way, very bloody and gory, but in my opinion this is the weakest part of the movie.

Going to see Django with my wife and friend, I thought Dajango was going be either very good or very bad! Dajngo is similar to Inglorious Bastards with over the top violence, surprise killings of characters, and plot twists. Tarantino uses some historical research then changes history! Django has several characters tell their sub-stories into making one big story. Waltz out shines Di Caprio and Foxx in Django as the showman, and mechanical bounty hunter. One learns even Waltz's character even has limits. Di Caprio's character loves his power at the plantation, and the game man ship with Waltz. Foxx is the man on a mission trying to find his lady. The surprise acting performance on par with Waltz is Jackson's. The surprise is how much a impact Jackson had with a small roll. Jackson was (behind Di Caprio) the second most powerful man at the plantation for he knew from the inside how and what the other slaves where planning. Jackson's character loved his power and a few of his comments gave Jackson the same power of a political adviser. Django, like Bastards, ends in a Tarantino style revenge flick, with all the gore too. I give Django an eight out of ten.",

531,26 January 2013,Troy_Campbell,7," Violent, stylish, fun and flawed.","Although Kill Bill Vol 2 was a western of sorts, this is Tarantino's first full blown attempt at cinema's oldest genre and, in true QT form, he pilfers from every gun-slinging saga that has come before to create a unique entry into the genre. Charting the exploits of freed slave Django (Jamie Foxx) as he tracks down wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), this story doesn't say as much as it thinks – or as much as Quentin proclaimed – about slavery in the mid 18th century, instead offering up a blood-splattering, popcorn-fuelled revenge pic that has a tendency to allow its characters slip into caricatures. In that framework it succeeds, and there are a plethora of vintage-Tarantino sequences that are an absolute joy to watch; not least the montage halfway through featuring an anachronistically awesome hip-hop tune fused with country music. The undebatable highlight of the movie though is Christoph Waltz, dishing up an indelible performance as German dentist-cum-bounty hunter Dr King Schultz. He knows his way around Tarantino's famously verbose dialogue like no-one else and the film suffers ever so slightly whenever he is not on screen. It's too long at 165 minutes, but there's plenty of violent, stylish fun to be had.",

There's a point at about 2hrs 10 min. when I had seen a good story and expected it to end. But Noooooo. We need to get all wrapped up in a sub-story about Australian cowboys(huh?) that does nothing for the plot and only serves to place extra firepower into the hands of the main character. Will somebody get this guy an editor? I'm willing to put up with QT's usual anachronisms, and even his flagrant nonsensical sequences: at one point his hero, en route from Texas to Tennessee, is shown bathing in a Yellowstone(i.e., Wyoming/Montana) hot pool, with the Grand Tetons in the background. I suppose the hot springs could be in Arkansas-which would make sense-but not the Grand Tetons. I was impressed with the originality of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but this film and Inglorious Basterds, while they have great performances and great moments in them, stray too far from reality for my money.",

I know this sound utterly prosperous, but in his recent film ""Django Unchained"", he has really added some great 'spaghetti western' homage moments from some very obscure films which included movie scores from ""Two Mules for Sister Sara"" (Clint Eastwood / Shirley MacLaine) and ""My Name is Trinity"" (Terence Hill / Bud Spencer); two films in which I utterly adore.

539,6 April 2013,hendersondamien77,10, AAngryFilmFan Reviews Django Unchanied,"If this review had be one sentence, it would be this: Go See This Movie! It is 100 percent awesome! When the movie was over, I had this giant smile on my face. So, what is the story? Set in the antebellum era of the Deep South and Old West, the film follows a freed slave (Foxx) who treks across the United States with a bounty hunter (Waltz) on a mission to rescue his wife (Washington) from a cruel plantation owner (DiCaprio). First off, the story is original, I could not guess on what could happen in the story, and it kept my attention all the way through. It contains moments where some scenes that me feel unpleasant, but in the good way, as it made me care for the characthers and the struggles they had to face. Speaking of the characthers, all of them are written perfectly, and acted to perfection. In fact, they maybe the best that Tarantino has ever written, thanks to some great characther develpoment. Jamie Foxx was great as Django. He is likable, has funny moments, and has great characther develpoment. He turns from this slave that barely speaks, to someone that has moments that made me say Heck Yeah! Also in the cast, is Christoph Waltz as Dr. King Schultz. Again he is likable, has some of the best dialogue in the movie, and has brilliant chemistry with Django. I am happy he won best supporting actor at the Oscars. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Calvin Candile, who is a villain I love to hate. His dialogue is brilliant, and becomes more creepier as we learn more about him. It great to see Leo takes this type of role, clearing showing that he is a talented actor. And last, but not least, Samuel L. Jackson as Stephen. Most of things he says in this movie is hilarious! and has great banter with DiCaprio characther. I mention the dialogue several times already, so shorty I say this. It is sharp and writty as ever, something that Tarantino is known for. It helps bring the world, story, and characthers to a whole new level. It uses the N word 114 times, but the film does it in a way that makes it funny and enjoyable. People have gotten mad about it, but Quentin Tarantino is not going to care about it, so why should I care? The action is awesome. It's bloody, and greatly shot. Now are there flaws? Well, it is a long movie, and it does feel long. However, thanks to everything I mention, this is only a minor gripe, and I appreciate Tarantino took the risk. Now, it time for the final verdict. As you can tell, I love this movie. It has a great story, dialogue, characthers, and everything I love about Tarantino. So without a doubt, the final verdict is my first 10/10 in my reviews. Now it is not perfect, but no film is. Every film has it's faults, but what the film does right, it does so with perfection. And this movie gets my first Awesometaclur seal of approval. Tarantino has created a masterpiece, that no sane human should miss. With that said, I see you guys on the next review.",

But whereas Basterds worked precariously around the mass armed conflict at the time, Django fires six shots into the heart of the issue that has generally been turned away from in cinema: slavery.

Django Unchained's plot is hardly novel and Tarantino adheres dutifully to the forms and conventions of the Western genre -even the pre-Civil war backdrop is peripheral in narrating what is basically a revenge saga; I saw Django as the male counterpart of Bride/Beatrix from Kill Bill and Django's relation with Schultz being similar to Vincent and Jules' in Pulp Fiction (a die-hard Tarantino fan would easily spot more).",

And along the way, he agrees to help free his wife... but that will not be easy, because she is being held by the flamboyant Calvin Candie(DiCaprio, playing it as an insidious psycho, shining in his first villain role, and shattering his fluffy, romantic image utterly; at one point, he caressed a horse, and it literally sent a chill down my spine... that is how despicable he is), and his ""spy"", Stephen(Jackson, as a manipulative traitor to his ethnicity), and they are not to be taken lightly. This is tense throughout, with us constantly worrying that our titular anti-hero(who is soft-spoken, both fulfilling the spaghetti Western trope and convincing you that he's been kept down his entire life) will suddenly just draw his gun and unload on the awful people abusing his kind - we know that they outnumber him, and that is not the way to successfully accomplish it. The action is incredibly tightly packed when it is there(keep in mind that this is a drama-thriller), and the rest of the time, we're either expecting it to erupt any minute, or catching our breath. Humor is impeccable, and I spent more than most of the 2 hour, 44 minutes(not counting end credits; ever self-indulgent, and could have been cut down to less? Sure. And the pacing does suffer a little, all entirely forgivable if you're into the director) of the running time doing one of three things: tapping my foot to the music(including both Ennio Morricone *and* modern rap music... and yes, somehow, it's always perfectly fitting; the mix of very different cultural elements is complementary), laughing uproariously, or with my heart pounding. It's shot beautifully on film, capturing every detail of the carefully designed props, costumes, sets, and the gorgeous exteriors, including snowy mountains. Tarantino(who packs minor roles with cameos from people we've seen in other of his pictures, and everyone cast looks the part, with unknowns missing teeth or speaking in a strange accent(the Southern is strong in this one) imbues this with his usual wordy, quotable dialog, though not much chronological jumping or complex plotting. There is pervasive graphic violence(brutal and bloody, highly unpleasant and disturbing to watch... not only because of the subject matter, although that does make it appropriate... well played, Quentin) and language(not big on the N-word? It's every fourth of fifth word spoken, here), and brief nudity(full frontal male, and topless female) in this. I recommend this to any big fan of his(if you only ""like"" his films, wait for a rental... and those who don't already enjoy his work need not apply at all). 10/10",

579,19 November 2020,higherborder,9, A masterpiece from a true cinephile,"I watched Django last night for the third time. The first time I saw it, I was not so impressed, it felt too different than the classic Tarantino. The second time I thought it was a good movie. But now, after several years, I think it is a marvelous movie. It was like watching it for the first time and the experience was outstanding. This is what a movie should be like. It is so powerful in every aspect. I have been a fan of QT for more than 15 years and I think that he is just becoming better and better. He is such a complete artist. In my modest opinion, few directors are able to make such an extravagant movie, with the combination of disturbing and hilarious scenes, with ridiculous clothes and mannerisms, and yet so profound and overwhelming. The emotional weight was enormous. Only a true visionary can pack all these elements into an unforgettable experience. Every word, every sigh, every look, every piece of dialogue is masterfully positioned to evoke the viewer's feelings and to enable them to be completely immersed in this epic piece of art. The music and the acting are on another level. I can't even think of how to describe it. With such vision, talent, knowledge, sensibility, and intuition, QT is capable to breathe life into characters and to make them immortal. I have never completely understood Tarantino's words that his dialogue carries emotion, but now I do. Performances are so strong, so genuine, and given with 100% devotion. Because of the ability to bring the best out of his actors, this movie has just established the greatness of Jamie, Washington, DiCaprio, Waltz, and of course, Jackson. One of the most memorable things to me is Jamie's acting when he hears about or sees Hildi's suffering. It so well written, so perfectly executed, it shows how strong is his pain on one hand, and how high is his control on the other. The one thing that ties the whole movie together is the song Freedom. This is one of the best uses of a song in a movie, a stroke of genius. Not only it carries the weight of terrible lives, but it also haunts you and reminds you what hell they had to go through. From an existential and a therapeutic point of view, the song and the movie convey the message of human life itself. How we live our whole lives in some kind of captivity, how we can easily give in and abandon our search for meaning and autonomy. Even though it's a theme of revenge, the movie, and especially Jamie Foxx, shows us the strength and drive that are innate to us, but many times are forgotten. It is not just a story about killing a bunch of people, it is a tale of great suffering that is inescapable, and a tale about how life shapes us, transforms us, and leads us in many unexpected ways.

584,21 January 2013,nickmesafilms,10," Django Unchained (2012) - The ""D"" is Silent!","Written and directed by the one and only Quentin Tarantino, ""Django Unchained"" is a spaghetti western satire set in the South, during the time of slavery. But at it's scope, this is yet another gruesomely violent, expertly written, and incredibly entertaining masterpiece from the man that brought us ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"". Jamie Foxx stars as the title character, an African-American slave who is suddenly freed by a former dentist turned bounty-hunter, played by Christoph Waltz, whom turns Django in as a bounty-hunter, as they both team up to track down and kill some of the town's biggest menaces for a quick reward. During their progress, these two hunters then set out to help free Django's enslaved wife, played by Kerry Washington, from the clutches of a villainous plantation owner, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and his trusted house slave, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Everything about this movie is what you already would have expected in a film by Tarantino. The witty and well-written dialogue, the certain choices of soundtrack, and the incredible directing are all nothing but masterful, as the accomplished director delivers yet another masterpiece in his long-life career as a filmmaker. Say whatever you want about his personal life, but this is one of Hollywood's most beloved filmmakers, delivering such a love for cinema in nearly every film he makes. Now, this movie might create controversy with some viewers, as it delivers more uses of the ""N-word"" in any film ever, and to make things even more disturbing, it's used in a film where the main topic involves the era of slavery. Tarantino was not trying to glorify any of the brutal attacks or language portrayed in the film, but instead uses it as a way to recreate the environment of that time in history, and how it affects people today. But, while you can still take the topic of slavery seriously, this is also one of the funniest movies of 2012. Just like in all of his films, the humor just gets better and better, making the movie a lot more entertaining all on it's own. Appearing in yet another Tarantino performance, after his Oscar-winning work in ""Inglourious Basterds"", Christoph Waltz delivers another convincing performance, still succeeds at delivering great Tarantino dialogue. His recent Oscar nomination for this film is rightfully deserving, but it's strange that he was put in the supporting category, when he has more screen-time than anyone else in the film. Jamie Foxx is just as remarkable as the former slave turned bounty-hunter, delivering some of the film's most memorable moments. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers one of the most menacing performances of his career, and he's easily the most interesting character. It's a real shame that he was snubbed by the Academy for his vicious but charismatic performance as Calvin Candie, a ruthless plantation owner. Tarantino favorite Samuel L. Jackson also delivers a hilarious performance as Calvin's only trusted house slave, as he suddenly suspects what business those these two people need in their plantation. At a pace of 165 minutes, I would argue that the movie does run a little bit long, but the movie takes it's time very well, and it always keeps your attention. This is an incredibly well-made, and definitely entertaining feast that only true film lovers will enjoy. From the first shot, to the final bloody climax, ""Django Unchained"" is one of 2012's best films. ""Django Unchained"", in my review, ""wickedly entertaining, good old-fashioned Tarantino"".",

But what I really enjoyed most were the strong performances and vivid characterizations -- Jamie Foxx as the determined slave Django, but even more so his partner Christoph Waltz, who is exceptional yet again (I loved his good-hearted character Schultz here). I never thought I would ever enjoy Leonardo DiCaprio in anything, but I thought he was remarkably villainous in DJANGO. Samuel Jackson was truly excellent, I thought, the first time we see him in the part of an aged house servant ... but it seemed like his elderly and slow-moving character rejuvenated a little more each time we saw him later (at least this was my initial impression). And a big surprise was a short-lived yet highly entertaining tour de force by Don Johnson!",

Quentin Tarantino's latest endeavour takes us into his fictional historical tale of the deep south of the United States in the antebellum era. There are endless, near indescribable qualities that the modern spaghetti western remarkably presents. Everything Tarantino wants to accomplish, he achieves. If the director/writer means for you to laugh, you will laugh. If it's fun he's after, prepare to be entertained. In regards to emotion, for some, a spare Kleenex may be required to endure the brutality of slavery that has not been explored in such a graphic, yet ludicrously stylish manner in cinematic history.",

It had beautiful scenery and great sets. Jamie Foxx stars as Django, a slave who is recently saved and freed by a German bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz. Schultz needs Django's help to hunt down the Brittle brothers. In exchange, Schultz will help Django find Calvin Candie, the man who bought his wife, Broomhilda. This was probably the coolest western movie I've seen in years. It had a great revenge story.

596,21 February 2013,johnmschofield,9, An absolutely cracking spectacle,"All I knew about this film was that Quentin Tarantino had directed it and I hoped that it would be reasonably entertaining. I should not doubt the man's ability to produce the goods almost all of the time and in my opinion this film falls into the very good category. My friend and I noticed it was 165 minutes in length and we were initially a little concerned but as it turned out we did not need to be, in that we were both riveted for the entire film. Be warned there is a lot of violent parts and brutal torture scenes but we have both been to several of the plantations around New Orleans and read up on what happened at most of them and based on the knowledge we gleaned quite frankly if anything the graphic scenes are toned down a lot. It has an 18 rating for good reason not that the violence is gratuitous in my opinion. I personally think the film could have been improved if it had been longer but apart from that what is included is extremely entertaining. My friend and I ran the gamut of emotions throughout this creation and in our experience that usually means a cracking spectacle. The scene very near the end of the film involving Jamie Foxx, two servants and the 'lady' of the house had us both in stitches. To see why you will need to watch it for yourselves and we both highly recommend that you do as soon as possible. You will not be disappointed.",

599,29 January 2013,jboothmillard,8, Django Unchained,"From BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Quentin Tarantino, he once described Pulp Fiction as having music similar to a spaghetti western, he had always wanted to make a proper western, so this was his opportunity, and to go a similar direction in terms of history changes like Inglorious Basterds, he definitely didn't disappoint in making it a hit. Basically, set in 1858, the Speck Brothers have purchased several African American slaves, chained them together and transporting them, but they encounter German immigrant dentist Dr. King Schultz (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Christoph Waltz) from Düsseldorf who is a bounty hunter, and after finding and buying the man he was looking for kills most of the captors. The slave that he releases is Django Freeman (Jamie Foxx), who was separated from his African American wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) and they were sold as slaves to separate parties, and Schultz needs him to identify the Brittle brothers working on a plantation in order to collect the reward for them dead or alive, and they make an agreement to grant the slave's freedom, and give him money and a horse. They succeed in finding and killing the Brittle brothers Big John (Lost's M.C. Gainey), Lil Raj (Cooper Huckabee) and Ellis (Doc Duhame), and the doctor and Django make a deal that if he partners with him as a bounty hunter, killing wanted criminals across plantations and taking a percentage of the reward until spring, he will help him find his and rescue wife, so Django is trained with his gun skill over the winter. They collect many bounties during the season, and they make enquiries and find out that Broomhilda is working as a slave for charming but brutal plantation owner Calvin Candie (Golden Globe nominated Leonardo DiCaprio), Schultz uses his way of words to persuade the ruthless businessman that he and his free manservant and fellow purchaser want to buy one of his male slaves that fight to the death (called ""Mandingo fighting""). They reach the plantation Candyland in Mississippi, and knowing that Broomhilda speaks German they offer money to buy her so the doctor relieve his desire to speak his mother tongue, so the plan is to sign a document that the money will be paid later and Django will leave immediately with his wife back in his arms. Sinister and suspicious African American house slave/servant Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) is sure however that the female slave and the potential African American purchaser know each other already, and he voices his observations to Candie, so with this information he confronts the two cons. He demands that Schultz and Django pay $12,000 for Broomhilda or he will kill her, the doctor agrees to pay and assumes they can leave, but Candie demands that they should shake hands to finalise the deal or the wife will be shot, and refusing the doctor pulls out his hidden sleeve gun and fires. Candie is killed and a big shoot out ensues, Django shoots many of the men trying to kill him, but stops when Stephen threatens to kill his wife unless he surrenders, and when he does he is tied up, and eventually he is set up to be sent to work to death in a coal mine, this is with Candie's sister Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly (Laura Cayouette) agreement. On the journey though Django convinces the slave drivers and employees of The LeQuint Dickey Mining Co. (Michael Parks, John Jarratt and Quentin Tarantino) that he is a bounty hunter, presenting a wanted poster as proof, and they agree to free him if they will go back with him to kill some criminals for the reward, but he turns and kills them to escape, taking dynamite, and freeing the other slaves in the cart. Returning to Candyland he finds the dead body of Schultz, taking the certificate from his pocket with Candie's signature that Broomhilda would be freed, and the mourners return from the funeral of Candie where he reveals himself and kills everyone inside, except for Stephen who shows himself as not truly limping, but he gets shot in the knees. In the end Django frees the remaining slaves, he lights the fuse to the dynamite that he had placed around the walls before the company arrived, he and Broomhilda watch from a distance as the house explodes, killing Stephen inside, and they ride away on a horse to live happily together again. Also starring Walton Goggins as Billy Crash, Dennis Christopher as Leonide Moguy, James Remar as Butch Pooch / Ace Speck, David Steen as Mr. Stonesipher, Nichole Galicia as Sheba, Don Johnson as Big Daddy, Franco Nero as Amerigo Vessepi, James Russo as Dicky Speck, Tom Wopat as U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum, Don Stroud as Sheriff Bill Sharp, Amber Tamblyn as Daughter of a Son of a Gunfighter, Bruce Dern as Old Man Carrucan, Jonah Hill as Bag Head #2, Zoë Bell as Tracker, Tom Savini as Tracker and tom thumb's Russ Tamblyn as Son of a Gunfighter. Foxx gives a good leading performance, Waltz is near scene stealing as the witty and intelligent doctor slash killer, DiCaprio is a marvellous choice for the villain, and Jackson also proves a great surprise as the sinister house butler. This film was not without its controversy, especially in its approach to the history of black slavery, and high use of the ""N"" word, but Tarantino makes it is a thrilling experience, with clever blaxploitation material, witty dialogue, explosive action and adventure, great music choices, and lots of nostalgic homages to classic films, a fantastic spaghetti western. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Tarantino, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Editing and Sound, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture – Drama.

600,14 February 2013,asda-man,10, The best Western ever!,"Quentin Tarantino has made some dastardly good films. Kill Bill Vol.1 remains one of my all time favourite films, Pulp Fiction is a captivating classic, Inglorious Basterds is one hell of a gem and Kill Bill Vol.2 is too. When I heard that Quentin was going to doing a spaghetti western I was extremely positive about the idea, despite not having a great taste for the Western genre. The idea of a Quentin Western was very attractive, and his style and writing skills looked as though they could perfectly fit the part of a Western. It turns out that all my feelings were right! For Quentin has created one of the best films I've seen, and certainly the best Western I've seen which makes Clint Eastwood's, Unforgiven look like Bratz: The Movie!

623,31 July 2019,david-eppink,10, Tarantino always delivers,"Django Unchained (2012): Dir: Quentin Tarantino / Cast: Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo Di Caprio, Kerry Washington, Samuel L. Jackson: Quentin Tarantino does it again with a stylish yet extremely violent take on westerns set in the 1800's black slavery era. Jamie Foxx stars as Django Freeman who not only is freed from slavery but also pledges to free his wife Brunhilde, played by Kerry Washington. He is freed and recruited by bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz in the hunt for the Brittle brothers. Django proves effective in this area and Schultz learns that Brunhilde is at a plantation run by Calvin Candie. Once again Tarantino showcases his love and knowledge of film with references to classic westerns but he also pulls off the most hilarious Ku Klux Klan sequence in recent memory. Foxx plays the fearless Django driven to the limits to find and free his wife. Christoph Waltz delivers his second excellent Tarantino performance. He plays Schultz as a gifted teacher with the willingness to grant freedom but also see those oppressors driven to defeat dead or alive. Leonardo Di Caprio as Calvin Candie is a sly villain who sets up slave fights for sport. Washington plays the abused Brunhilde who finds relief in the reality of the appearance of her husband whom is scheming to buy her from Candie. Samuel L. Jackson provides humour as Candie's house host who brown noses for favors including exposing Django and Freeman. While the climax is a revenge driven mass of exploding bodies, the controversy surrounding racial slurs is countered by events that have since been unchained to the reality of freedom.

Storyline was great. For those who complained the movie was too long, the movie was true to run times of classic spaghetti westerns. Time was slow... there was nothing but time back then. And for those, .. well, that's personal politics. I absolutely LOVED the movie & have watched it several times, just to see the shoe on the other foot. Without a doubt this is a classic Tarantino movie... among his best!",
625,6 August 2019,covington_c,10, STANDING OVATION!!!,"Fast, furious and vastly entertaining with a majestic performance from Christoph Waltz. It is long and although does not seem too long in the cinema, does on reflection have scenes, like the carriage ride through the plantation, that might have been trimmed or indeed the KKK scene that reminds of Blazing Saddles that could have been chopped altogether. Leonardo DiCaprio is also very good, as is Samuel l Jackson in the most creepy of roles. For me there seemed to be more charismatic guys than Jamie Foxx at every turn, but maybe that's just me as he certainly pairs up with Waltz well enough in the early scenes. There were less striking panoramas and vast vistas than I had expected in a semi spaghetti western but then it occurred to me that Tarantino always has his cinematographer shoot tight and that many of his films could be transferred directly to the stage without much change so lacking are they in this dimension. Strange, but then dialogue always has been the most important part of the Tarantino product as it is here in several scorching sequences of great wordplay.",
626,23 January 2013,christopher-underwood,8, majestic performance,For fans of Inglorious this is a fitting follow up dealing with slavery before the civil war. His homage to Westerns is charmingly done. There are many hilarious moments and the performances are right on. Samuel L Jackson is unrecognizable and so funny he deserved a nomination. Jamie Foxx as Django is suitably perplexed then intense. It's a role he is really suited for more so than his more serious roles. Christoph Waltz's comedic delivery of his lines completely carries the first half of this movie. It was wrong to kill him off. Leonardo is quite good and I found him more convinging in this comic supporting role than his leading serious roles.,

I left 2 hours and 45 minutes later feeling jittery, unsettled, and overwhelmed by emotions I hadn't experienced consciously in ages. To be perfectly fair, the film is breathtaking from a cinematographic perspective. Tarantino is an artist, and his eye for camera work is impeccable. He is by no means afraid to take risks, and this resonates with audiences; it is no accident that he has acquired so large a following.",

The setup to the story is clever, the cinematography and soundtrack are excellent, and the performances from Jamie Foxx, Cristoph Waltz, and Leonard DiCaprio are all wonderful. The film exposes the cruelty of slavery in both brutal and subtle ways, the asinine beliefs of the racism of the period, and sends up an early version of the KKK.

661,6 December 2021,solomcatore,9, Near perfect.,"This film is Quentin Tarantino's take on the Western genre and he does not hold back from his style. There is a galore of visceral violence, amoral characters and historical revisionism. When applied to the Western genre, the results are ridiculous, but he just rolls with it as a fantasy for the audience. The main characters are the sophisticated Dr. King Schultz and Django Freeman, bounty hunters who try to rescue Django's wife Broomhilda. Their plan is unbelievably stupid and it's a wonder how they ever function. After predictably failing, the film's focus switches to Django attempting to salvage the situation and this pads out the runtime with even more blood and brutality.",

The gradual bond between the pair always feels very real, though the plot is more complicated than just that as the partners plan an ambitious quest to rescue the slave's wife from a sadistic plantation owner, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Jumping between serious drama and quirky comedy (ambushers bantering about the bags on their head), it is easy to see why the film might not jive with everyone's sensibilities, but there is a lot to like about the complex characters as well as the way Tarantino generates laughs in a story about one of the ugliest parts of American history. Christoph Waltz is superb as the German bounty hunter, and not just due to delivering excellent comic relief. He is a true outsider in the racist America of the 1850s, and his character's growing disgust with the way slaves are treated really resonates; much like Oskar Schindler's character progression, he may have initially been into killing slave traders for the profits, but by the final hour of the film, there is much more passion to it. Some have been critical of the film's very violent third act, but if nothing else, it comes off well as a response to DiCaprio's questions about submissiveness and the film concludes on a surefire memorable note.",

Foul characters are many, taboo speech is thrust upon us constantly and violence is abundant. But all the while, it's just so damn stylish. Tarantino is in complete control throughout. He knows exactly what he's about in every scene and makes sure you always know you're witnessing one of his films from minute one through to minute 165 (yes, even during the credits he's still up to his old tricks).",
675,5 February 2013,jtindahouse,9, Tarantino as stylish and captivating as ever,"Tarantino does for the slaveholders of the South, what he did for Nazis in Inglourious Basterds in his last film. Django is a wild ride from start to finish. Jamie Foxx is the title character, a slave freed by a German bounty hunter played to perfection by Christoph Waltz, who won an Oscar for his role in Basterds. He shows here that he is no one trick pony, as he and Foxx own the screen for almost its' entire two hour and forty five minute running length. Leonardo DiCaprio shows up as a vicious plantation owner, and he is the perfect villain. Be prepared for inhuman brutality, including a scene with attack dogs that will turn your stomach. However, it is necessary to show the reality of America's unforgivable history. Fox and Waltz are as good a pair as I have ever seen and Samuel L. Jackson shows up about 2/3 of the way in as a right hand man, or house n*****, a term used frequently, and causing some controversy as politically incorrect. Again, as with the graphic violence, the language keeps the movie realistic. The cast is exceptional, and Tarantino's script is cutting and frequently hilarious. No one alive is anywhere near as interesting as him as a writer or director; the man has brass ones. Along with ""Beasts of the Southern Wild,"" the best film of 2012.",

681,5 February 2016,samfischer88,10, Tarantino Does It Again!,"This is a weird, uneasy, drone-on of a movie filled with odd characters, off-kilter acting, and excessive bloody violence. It also has a run time of over two and a half hours due in part to the fact that individual scenes go on and on and on. It seems to be a parody, a satire, and a comedy but I am not sure. For me, this movie doesn't feel as if it has a strong sense of what it wants to be. If it is a comedy and a send up it is unclear as to what it is parodying. Is it the history of the old south entrenched in sadistic racism? Or is it parodying movie westerns with an updated violence-drenched plot? If it is a comedy, the laughs are few and far between - unless one is supposed to laugh at all the excess. Or maybe it is just an excuse to have some gory fun in the context of a parody and really isn't meant to be taken too seriously. But it seems to me to be an odd pairing to use horrors of American slavery and man's unspeakable inhumanity to man as mere background dressing for either parody or broad comedy. Whatever the intent, the end product just doesn't gel into anything meaningful and is only mildly entertaining at best. Given the odd structure it is hard to feel anything for the characters, and given the gory bloodbath at the end of the film, one can only assume that the blood bath is supposed to be entertaining. As I said, a weird movie experience and not exactly family fun. For the most part, the actors willingly participate in the Director's nonsensical excesses. Leonardo's character can't say a line without chewing up the scenery, and Morgan Freeman's Candyland seems to have come from the school of bug-eyed stereotypical acting of the fifties. The best part of the film is Christoph Waltz who brings a much-needed conviction and purpose to this film.",

683,6 January 2015,jimbo-53-186511,6," My feelings on this film reflect my feelings on a lot of Tarantino's films; overrated, but still reasonably enjoyable","To the surprise of no one, Django Unchained is an essentially Tarantino love letter to a genre that's been left sadly underutilized over recent decades. It's every bit a straightforward action / revenge picture, with debts owed to the dozens of Leone & company spaghetti westerns that populated theaters in the sixties and seventies. The central plot is thread-bare - several of Pulp Fiction's competing story lines have quite a bit more depth - but surprisingly never really feels like it lingers or oversteps its bounds, even as the runtime approaches three hours. Eyes-forward escapism is the message of the day, and Django scratches that itch with vigor. It's a tale that, despite an egregious body count and a comical amount of gory debauchery, doesn't take itself too seriously and is inexplicably able to draw hearty laughs from moments that would have been downright chilling in another director's hands. The key role players are almost unanimously entertaining; DiCaprio as the smarmy, loathsome plantation owner, Jackson as his savvy right-hand man, Foxx as the blunt instrument of justice... they all play one note, but it's flawlessly tuned. The real show-stealer, once again, is Christoph Waltz, whose grinning, man-of-the-world bounty hunter fuels the majority of the fire. Although his role is a polar opposite to the slimy Nazi turncoat he portrayed in Inglourious Basterds, it's no less memorable and the picture sags noticeably when he isn't on the screen. Tarantino has turned in smarter efforts, carved deeper characters and written sharper dialog, but he's rarely been this indulgently entertaining. I loved the experience, especially in a theaterful of similarly-humored moviegoers, and can't wait to ingest the subtleties on my own when it's released for home viewing.",

The violence, when it comes, seems provoked but unexpected and unnecessary for the characters involved as I could find no empathetic bond with any of the characters to explain their actions although being a QT film you know that unspeakable violence is always a misplaced word away.

692,21 January 2013,estebangonzalez10,9, Tarantino and Waltz should continue their partnership forever!,"Even with its nearly 3 hour runtime, Django Unchained proves to be more than an awesome bloody blast from Tarantino and holds some of the greatest performances in all his films to date. Christoph Waltz is outstanding, and by all means the best actor in the film. His role and character fit so well with him and his personality, that is easy for him to get lost in it, and quite impressive as well. Besides Waltz's very earned Oscar awarded performance, Jamie Foxx also proves to be an excellent actor in the film as well, providing one of his best performances in recent years. The film is very cleverly written, and somehow excellently paced. The cinematography is interesting and excellent, and the costumes, music, and atmosphere of the film fit oh so right. The film never leaves you wanting more, or having seen too much, it just feels right, and props to Tarantino for making it so enjoyable. The film is massively entertaining, quite funny, and absolutely raw with action. In the end, Django Unchained is a near masterpiece- and an absolute joy to watch. It's performances are often breathtaking, especially from Waltz, and its writing is excellent- as well as any atmospheric parts about it. In my opinion, it is one of, if not, the best film Tarantino has ever made, and an impressive feat to match.

Silver Linings Playbook attempted to provide a genuine romantic comedy/drama, but instead ended up as an incredibly predictable and cliché typical Hollywood flick.

The violence is classic Tarantino, being extremely over the top that it is almost comedic (in the best way). The acting is incredible too, Jamie Foxx manages to pull of one of the coolest characters ever created, alongside the deserved Oscar winning performance by Christoph Waltz, and Leonardo Dicaprio acting at the top of his game, who is perfection while playing the bad guy.

Let me say up front that I love westerns, always have, always will and in my humble but accurate opinion, there hasn't been a truly great western made in a very long time. Well the spell is broken and Django unchained is setting the bar pretty darn high for any wanna-bees to follow. Quentin Tarantino shows why he is considered one of the best writers/directors in show business today. It would be a mistake not to praise the outstanding work by both Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz, to say their portrayal of an ex-slave turned bounty hunter and ex-dentist turned bounty hunter was exceptional would be an understatement. Also another wonderful performance from the ever consistent Leonardo DiCaprio in the role of a cruel plantation slave owner. Listen, this movie is a must see adventure western, yes there is plenty of blood and guts but you've got to expect that with Quentin Tarantino films, this is such an unique step back into the pre-civil war slave era, to miss this journey and saga would be a big mistake.",

There has been a lot of press about the 'racist' aspect of this movie. I think most sane people will argue that racism is a bad thing, but there is a subtle difference in a film that is actually racist and a film that is about racism. No one (at least no one with a brain) denies that the slave trade was a dark chapter in this country's past, and this movie acknowledges this fact. Most of the white people in the movie are repulsive characters, and Django is one of the smartest characters in the movie. He seems dumb at first, but that's because he hasn't been taught anything during his life of servitude. The ability to learn is what makes a person smart.",

While ""Django"" isn't my favorite of Tarantino films, I still wholeheartedly believe it's a five star movie. It's intense, emotionally moving, exquisitely written and directed, and wonderfully acted; it's also a film I can watch again and again and never grow tired of. Django's journey is not for the light of heart; it has moments of horrible brutality and heartbreak, but it also has great moments of triumph. Those moments of triumph are elevated by the amount of work that went into crafting the characters of Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz, ""Alita Battle Angel"") and Django (Jamie Foxx, ""Collateral""), whom quickly becomes one of the most dynamic protagonists of all of Tarantino's films.

The worst part is that the film though is a period drama, is far from reality & can't even be called a drama. Add to that the length, all of 165 minutes which added to my agony. I know Quentin Tarantino is a great filmmaker but with such a great cast & some decent performances, he should have done more to the weak script, mind you he is the mind behind the story & script.

719,24 September 2016,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,10, A Film as Red as its Title-Card.,"First of all I wish to say that if the shooting of the horse at the beginning is real and not simulated or feigned this would mean cruelty against animals which is a crime and you must forget what I am going to comment below because then the movie should be utterly condemned. When Quentin Tarantino was interviewed after he made this movie the interviewer asked him if he didn't think that his movies had too much violence. Tarantino replied, rather irritated, that society is much more violent. And he was utterly right of course. This movie has violence galore and lots of blood. But this violence is totally acceptable as real in the context of the story and you must not forget that slavery was in itself and in its daily events a constant huge violence. This is the story of a man who makes a living by being a bounty hunter (he killed bandits hunted up and down by justice to get the reward offered to whom delivered them dead or alive) who at a certain point takes as his assistant a slave called Django (Jamie Foxx who does a fine job at this part) freeing him after he helped him to find three of those bandits. After that the body hunter who was in fact a fine cultivated gentleman with some humane feelings (though trigger happy) decides to help Django to find his wife, another slave from whom he was forcibly separated in a slave auction. This leads them to a series of thrilling adventures very well shown in images, scenes, sequences and dialogues, showing a cast of very well depicted and presented characters with great performers. The sceneries, both interior and exterior, are excellent. Of course in this kind of movies there are also a few actual unlikelihoods (for instance the facility with which the shooter hits fully and precisely very distant targets which anyone who has for instance done military duties knows it is very difficult if not impossible and the facility with which the ""goody"" hero kills a crowd of villains supposedly as good shooters as himself and without even being hit himself). But in its whole it is a good movie indeed in terms of action, sceneries, cut, actors' direction and performing and screen-play carrying out with extremely dramatic scenes.",

If he were to come out with a movie that I felt was horrible, I'd have no problem saying it. I just don't believe he's ever put out a movie that was less than ""good"" and I'd go so far as to declare DJANGO UNCHAINED one of his better movies. The movie has everything I've come to expect from one of his movies (great characters, brutal violence, sleek writing, etc.) and comes with the added bonus of being one of the few Westerns I can enjoy enough to watch over and over. The movie follows the tale of Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave in mid 19th century America who fate has separated from his beloved wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). Resigned to a life of miserable servitude, Django's life changes for the better when he is approached and 'purchased' by the eccentric Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). Schultz is a bounty hunter and needs Django's assistance in searching for a team of slavers and promises, in return, to aid Django in locating Broomhilda and reuniting the two of them. It might have been a simple mission if Broomhilda hadn't been purchased by the infamous Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), owner of the largest and most feared plantation in the South: Candieland. Schultz and Django form a plan to gain entrance to Candieland and escape with Broomhilda, but this is a Tarantino movie so it's never that simple.",

After he is gone, there is a massacre scene in which one man with a six shooter takes care of every farm hand on the plantation, without reloading. Some of the dialog is clever, which makes me wonder if Quentin Tarantino actually did any of the writing. As of today, I will NEVER see another movie directed by him. If this movie wins any awards, anyone who votes for this movie must take some responsibility for the ever increasing violence in this country. Hollywood and Tarantino especially!

His signature use of innovative storytelling, sharp dialogue, and inventive parodying of classic Hollywood subgenres have driven him to being one of the most unique filmmakers working today. He's took an idiosyncratic twist on World War II on the German front in 2009's revenge fantasy 'Inglourious Basterds' as well as a stylish spin on the martial arts genre in 'Kill Bill' and it's sequel. Tarantino takes on the western genre in Django Unchained, a revisionist western film set in the Deep South that explores an audacious, yet darkly funny spin on the harrowing period of slavery during the Pre-Civil War era. Set in the 1850s, Jamie Foxx plays Django Freeman, an African American prisoner who is freed from slavery by a German bounty hunter and former dentist, Dr. King Schultz (played by Christoph Waltz). The two embark on a journey across the South to Mississippi to save Django's wife Broomhilda (played by Kerry Washington), who is being held in slavery by sadistic plantation owner Calvin Candie (played by Leonardo Dicaprio) who has the loyalties from his trustful slave Stephen (played by Samuel L.

Tarantino is clearly a one trick pony and it's been getting progressively worse since the high point that was Pulp Fiction, the sharp dialogue has gone, the once trend setting soundtracks are now completely out of place - see the use of Verdi's Requiem Mass in this film, a cheap and ineffective rip-off of the Wagner section in Apocalypse now - the same story told over and over again just transplanted into a different setting and the work of a human who views others only as a means to show over-stylized death.

A very interesting take on the spaghetti-western that takes place two years before the Civil War. In one particular scene, early in the film we get to know our two main characters, Django (Jamie Foxx) and Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz). We are treated to a fleshing out of the cultural differences between the two characters by a simple device of visualization. While in a bar, Shultz, who is a bounty hunter, but a man of sophistication, explains to the slave-Django exactly why he needs him. As he talks to Django, Shultz, at the same time, is getting both of them a beer from the tap.

It's about time film fans were honest about that.,"This movie is once again a feast for the eyes and ears, though it tends to sag halfway through. And it never recovers. This hasn't exactly much to do with DiCaprio or Jackson, whose characters are introduced around that time, OR those characters. It's just that the movie entered a section where my thoughts apparently tended to wander off. That's never a good sign. It's then that I stopped being fully engaged and it's where I became aware that I was watching just another fun, silly movie that was starting to get really top-heavy. Also, and this is kinda serious, Django the character was kinda.. BORING. This might have been the intention. For example, it could be that Django was mirroring one-dimensional gunslinger heroes of classic westerns, but when you hear these accompanying musical odes you can't help but to expect more. A bit more fleshed out character and even some added spice. I liked the fact that the original Django had a cameo, plus that there where these original songs written especially for the movie this time. Especially the song 'Ancora Cui' by Morricone. Not that it really matters, but if you're gonna hand out a damn Oscar, give it to Morricone and Elisa Toffoli instead of Adele.",

749,21 March 2021,sriramthestranger,8, Style & Simple!!,"Quentin Tarantino is back with his kick ass new film, a spaghetti western called Django Unchained. Containing a great story, terrific performances, good dialogue, and brilliant pacing, Django is Tarantino's best film since Pulp Fiction, and that is really saying something. The story of Django Unchained is that a black slave turned bounty hunter named Django is going after a plantation owner that has his wife. The story is told in a great way that only Tarantino can do, I can't explain it really, but the story is so fascinating I was always interested to see where it was going. It also uses its setting to great effect, along with great pacing that keeps moving at a fast pace, you will find this story's setting just as interesting as its colorful characters and gorgeous visuals, or the gripping balls-to-the-wall action scenes. With its all-star cast containing big names like Leonardo Dicaprio, Samuel L Jackson, Jamie Foxx, and many others you know that they are all going to pull off their roles perfectly. And boy do they ever, especially Leonardo Dicaprio who plays one of my favorite villains in recent memory, and Jamie Foxx is a natural fit for this character. Their dialogue is well written, but there is one problem with the dialogue and that is the constant usage of the n-word. While I understand that people back then used that word very often, I still could've done without them saying it every 30 seconds. However, that is a relatively small complaint. Django Unchained is a insanely entertaining western that I hold on par with Tarantino's best film: Pulp Fiction. It's brilliant mix of action, dialogue, setting, visuals, and storytelling ensures that this is one film that deserves all the praise it has been receiving. As for Spike Lee's stupid criticism: I didn't know who he was till he said what he said, and he looks like a moron for saying it. This film is pure awesome.",

I enjoyed the unspoken camaraderie between Django and Dr. Schultz very much. Even more so after the relationship between them became more than what it was at first, on Dr. Schultz's part mostly, after the latter found out that Django was married and about Broomhilda. The character's fate at the end of the movie was touching but in a somewhat comedic manner. I like that while the movie takes place in a very discrimination-filled period of history against the blacks it's still filled with comedic moments here and there to lighten the mood making the experience of watching it more pleasurable and not as angry and whatnot at the racism of the black characters and how they're being treated.

It is almost perfect in it's old fashioned execution and spaghetti western style filming. I realize that this film is being heavily criticized for it's extreme violence and heavy use of the ""N"" word. Firstly, the great thing about this movie is that the violence is being directed at the right people for the most part, the people who in fact deserve their gory fate. Slavery was a terrible chapter in America's history, and two movies this year have brilliantly condemned it, albeit in two entirely different ways, Lincoln being the other film. Here Django, the film's heroin, takes justice into his own hands and shows the world how slave owners really were in those days. and also how to deal with them not in the most legal way, but arguably in the most effective and unarguable th most entertaining way possible. In this film, no evil doer gets off Scot free. All of them meet their very satisfying end under tarentino's watch. That is why you must forgive this film for all of it's bloodshed, because the blood is shed from the people who undoubtedly deserve it. And as for the N word, honestly it's 1860, people said the N word quite a bit in those times people!! Historical fiction is always criticized for the inaccuracy of some old custom or other (i.e. gladiator, Spartacus...anything about Rome). Well here ya go!",

The casting of his films works a lot like the casting of Rob Zombie movies with lots of fun little cameos that also serve to distract. Jaime Fox, on the whole, performs his character with a lot of pathos and charisma (and I'm glad they ended up casting him over Will Smith), but I think his portrayal has a lot to do with why I can't quite love this movie and think it needed another actor.",

Tarantino at his best (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, parts of Kill Bill 1 and 2) can remind you how exhilarating cinema can be. In his less successful works (parts of Kill Bill 1 and 2, the parts of Inglourious Basterds featuring the 'Basterds') his inability to resist allusions to other works or to resist characters that 'strike a pose' can lead the films to cross the line into pastiche. Although he's still guilty of these weaknesses in Django Unchained, they don't prevent it from being one of his best films and one that despite its faults, and there are few, maintains the viewers interest for most its near three hour length.

Travelling across the South together, the two men form a partnership, with Schultz teaching the former slave the skills of a bounty hunter. In exchange for hunting the Brittle Brothers, Schultz agrees to help locate and free Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who is still in captivity. She is a servant to a powerful slave trader, the courteous but untrustworthy Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). He runs a plantation called Candie Land, where slaves are encouraged to fight each other.

Jackson) remains suspicious of their new guests. ",
766,20 January 2013,Likes_Ninjas90,8, The film where Quentin Tarantino finally grew up,"Quentin Tarantino has become one of America's most innovative filmmakers in that he takes his unapologetic love of movies, B movies in particular, and crafts original films out of bits and pieces that pay homage to the movies he loves. No more obvious then his latest ode to the Spaghetti Western, Django Unchained. This epic story of ex-slave turned bounty hunter, Django (Jaime Foxx) has it's main character named after the lone gunslinger played by Franco Nero in Sergio Corbucci's classic Spaghetti Western of the same name. And in case you didn't get that point, not only does the film open with that 1966 film's theme song but, sports a delightful cameo from Franco Nero himself. The story opens with a slave, Django being bought in a humorously violent scene by German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz ( Christoph Waltz). Schultz promises Django his freedom if the slave will help him track down three wanted men Django has seen but, Schultz has not. But, Django has quite a knack for bounty hunting and after their quarry is gunned down, in a great scene involving a hilariously sleazy Don Johnson as a racist plantation owner, the two team up. But, when Schultz hears of the plight of Django's German speaking slave wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), he agrees to help him search for and free her. This brings them to the door of a vile plantation owner, who specializes in slave fights, named Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Will Django and Schultz be able to rescue his wife from the devious and well armed Candie? A lot of bullets and blood fly before that question gets answered. Django Unchained isn't perfect. It is definitely a bit too long and the last act could have structured a bit more efficiently but, Tarantino has always been a bit over indulgent and we let him slide because of all the things he gets right and because his films are usually so damn entertaining. And one of the things he gets so right here is the performances out of his cast. Jaime Fox is impressive as Django bringing both a sly humor and a smoldering strength to the slave turned bounty killer. I'm not usually a fan but, he won me over here. Christoph Waltz is an absolute delight as the German bounty hunter with a heart and sense of honor. He gives Tarantino's crisp and witty dialog vivid life and creates an instantly classic character from the pages of the director's script. The same could be said of the phenomenal performance by Leonardo DiCaprio whose wonderfully over the top Calvin Candie practically steals the show. DiCaprio is having a blast playing the vicious and sleazy dandy plantation owner whose charm oozes out of every pore but, only to cover up that this snake has fangs filled with venom and he will strike first chance he gets. And if that triple threat isn't enough, we have a side splitting performance by the great Samuel L. Jackson as Candie's cantankerous head slave Stephen. Stephen may be a slave but, sometimes his manipulation of Calvin makes you seriously wonder who is really running the Candie Land plantation. Tarantino once again gives this top notch cast some wonderful Tarantino dialog to work with and, as usual, shoots Django with his trademark luscious camera work. QT's love of film fills every frame. He skillfully mixes controversial topics such as the horrors of slavery and racism with some very sly and funny humor and peppers it with some blood spattering action and violence. Basically it's a Quentin Tarantino movie. And that's exactly what we paid to see. A fiercely entertaining movie with a great supporting cast featuring the likes of Jonah Hill, Bruce Dern, Don Stroud, Russ and Amber Tamblyn, Dennis Christopher, Michael Parks and James Remar to name a few.",

This film has certainly not been made to claim a place in the history of cinema.

I found it extremely clever and funny throughout. Indeed, it seems to be as much an homage to Blazing Saddles and Skin Game as to the original Django. I had my usual language objections (mild by Tarantino standards), but not the one that seemed to bother everyone else. Of course, if this were the old days, it would have benefited from an intermission that separated the first section from the Candie Land section. (I gave it a B.)",

While a brilliant writer and talented visual stylist, his films (that I've seen) are indulgent and style over substance. While Reservoir Dogs was fantastic, Pulp Fiction went on and on, and this goes on even longer. This has been critically acclaimed even though it's style over substance, which is what critics moan about in a very tiresome manner. Django Unchained follows a German bounty hunter and a freed slave hunting for the slave's captured wife to free her and taking out various other villains along the way. Explosive, daring and typically subversive, DU bleeds ultra kinetic, hyper violent style from the very beginning and even through the many slow talking scenes there's always plenty of energy crackling beneath the surface. The cast does a great job overall. Samuel L Jackson, although not particularly recognisable, steals the show, with Leonardo DiCaprio giving a wonderful hateful performance and Christoph Waltz providing plenty of charisma and emotion in another fine performance, although perhaps not quite Oscar deserving, but still excellent.

All of my friends who saw it in theaters raved about how ""crazy"" and ""awesome"" Django Unchained had been. I for one viewed the movie as the title of my review describes; racist, raunchy, and radical! There are a slough of things I could get into about this movie but I will keep it short. I had heard through the vine that while being very comedic, this movie had a very Western atmosphere and was realistic in its interpretation of Slavery during the 1860's. That being said with Django's comedic and black righteous overtones, wrapped into a Western Movie, I was very satisfied with this movie. Characters: In terms of bounty hunting Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz couldn't have done a better job. Dr. Schultz sporadic personality combined with Django's hatred for Candie made for a kick-ass duo. Upon the introduction of Candie, I couldn't have hated him more, which made his death all the more satisfying. Leonardo DiCaprio takes on a likeness I've never seen in him as Calvin Candie, the ruthless black-hearted owner of the Candyland Plantation. From the tone of his voice, to the torture he put Django's wife through, everything in between made his death all the more righteous in the grand scheme of the movie. A few other points of interest to me were some of the special effects. During scenes in which people died (there are a lot) I found the amount of blood spilled to be a bit unrealistic. Especially when Django has a shootout in the big house. The amount of blood spilled wasn't a gross out factor, it was somewhat comical. My friends looked at me funny when I started laughing during that scene. A final thing that kind of turned me off to Django a little bit was the use of the n word. I mean it isn't a big deal, but I got kind of tired of hearing it five times every scene. SO, over all I gave Django a 7 out of 10. Seven points awarded for the fact that it was a near perfect blend of comedy,action, and historical fiction, and three points taken off for overuse of certain special effects, and the N word, but hey, other than that, pretty good flick for those who aren't afraid of a little blood and a few heavy words.",

No wonder QT has won the awards for best screenplay from 3 different academies. QT's direction is a treat for lovers of good cinema. A good portion of the film is dialogue driven with lengthy though simple lines and there are a number of extended scenes .A very long drawn sequence at the dining table where Leonardo DiCaprio and Dr. Schultz are negotiating the sale is shot in great detail' It is very interesting to see that the movie unfolds at a leisurely pace in the first half or so where QT marries the music,framing and dialogue in his usual stylistic manner. Considerable footage is given to the male bonding between Dr. Schultz and Django which goes beyond the master -slave relationship. Specially absorbing is the doctor's explanation of how easily he goes about his bounty hunter's job. Some superlative performances are seen in this film. Jamie Foxx as Django lives the role and does not have much talking to do ; but his expressions do the talking. His costume changes as the film progresses have been questioned but its not a big issue. On the other hand Christoph Waltz as Dr. Schultz has considerable amount of dialogue which he delivers in great style. Some of his punches remind us of the older Dollar films.of Sergio Leone. He is excellent as the bounty hunter who goes about acquiring and eliminating criminals wanted dead or alive by the authorities. Maybe it is Leonardo DiCaprio who steals the show with his sinister interpretation of the cruel Mississippi plantation owner. Probably some hamming was the requirement of the character and he carries it off well. Because of the different makeup most people would hardly recognize Samuel Jackson as Leonardo's Butler plus henchman and he also has given an excellent performance.",

Everything started very well as expected from Tarantino. The way DiCaprio introduced was excellent. Samuel L. Jackson was also very good. To be honest, I was in favor of DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. In my opinion, the best scene was when DiCaprio cornered Dr.King and Django on the dinner table. Oh my god! That was awesome. That is where the tension in the movie raised to the peak and in my opinion that is the place where the movie should have ended. He should have kicked all their asses, hammered the girl and Django. However, after that point, Tarantino insistingly extends the scenes and succeeds to turn the tension he just created into boredom. Sorry guys but I got so bored and disappointed afterwards. How can he let DiCaprio get killed? That is ridiculous. What is all that handshaking stupidity? Would you look at that? Someone like DiCaprio forgot to search them for additional pistols. Sorry guys but I got so mad at Tarantino for taking us for a fool. Afterwards the movie continued as a superhero movie. And that part was for children under 13. It was like a torture to me.

801,4 February 2013,stimpy_tr,7, It should have ended much earlier!!!!,"Quentin Tarantino has been plundering cult cinema for over twenty years now, with varying degrees of success. Django Unchained sees the director turning to the Spaghetti Western for inspiration, borrowing film-making techniques from the greats of the genre (most notably Sergios Leone and Corbucci) while adding his own trademark touches-snappy banter and over-the-top violence. The result is something of a mixed bag-some of it works brilliantly, much of it is unremarkable yet still entertaining, and some of it is embarrassingly bad. Fortunately, the positives outweigh the negatives, the overall result being far from Tarantino's best work, but a long way from his worst as well.",

I hate the bad language, gratuitous violence and most of the subject matter in his films but I have to admit his films are brilliant (albeit I have to look away occasionally). Django Unchained is one of his best, in my opinion. The story is interesting, gripping and really poignant... it's about slavery and addresses it boldly and holds a light up to it without mincing it's words. The injustice of slavery is portrayed to graphic effect but I was expecting the atrocities to be a lot worse, and so was pleasantly surprised by this film being so comedic. It was really really funny, even the cringeworthy bits have humour, which is very unusual.

Moments later, the sequence climaxes and we see the winning slave bludgeoning the injured one to death with a hammer, which is mostly off-screen because the camera lingers on the other characters in the room. The sequence is intensely horrific, strangely audacious, and, in a way that can only be described as occult, fascinating because it says a lot of the characters.

This is pretty much 'Inglorious Bastards' with slaves standing in for Jews and Southern Americans standing in for the Nazis. All that being said, it's plenty of fun, DiCaprio and Waltz are good, but Samuel L. Jackson steals the show as the evil butler who becomes the thorn in the hero's side, but you know it's inevitable that he'll get his due (and he does). Jamie Foxx looks good, but kind of gets lost in all the muscular scenery chewing being dished up by the other actors, the relationship between him and his wife doesn't really come off. Tarantino never really integrates his influences into something of his own, when he runs out of classic movies to quote, he tends to lapse into cliché, but it doesn't really seem to matter anymore.",
807,27 September 2013,aklcraigc,6, Exuberant Pastiche,"Completely engaging, darkly comic and probably Tarantino's most intense picture to date, Django Unchained is his definitive western love letter; great action and involving revenge story interspersed with some disturbing material regarding the cruelty of the slave trade. The year is 1858 and Django (Jamie Foxx) is a loving husband to his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who is tragically separated from her when he is enslaved purely for the colour of his skin. He fortuitously meets a bounty hunter named Dr King Schultz (Christopher Waltz) who frees him and they form a strong bounty hunting partnership. Together they set out to find Broomhilda who is now being held captive by a sadistic plantation owner named Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). It's a very brave film in the same vein as 12 Years A Slave, Steve McQueen's incredible film released the same year with very similar themes. 12 Years was a much more emotional and serious depiction of this time whereas Django is definately played more for entertainment value. Nevertheless, it does still contain some repulsive imagery which fuels the audiences hatred for the villains and the desire for Django to reek his revenge. This along with wonderful realisation of characters makes this a film so worthy of its awards attention in 2012-2013. The violence Django inflicts, the complete opposite of the sadism of his captors, is gloriously cathartic and captured in visually stunning blood splattered carnage. In turns hyperactive and delivering great monologues, this is well worth a watch on the biggest screen you can find. Kerry Washington is severely underrated in this also; she is the emotional core of the story and is tremendous",

Quentin Tarantino comes across as an absolute idiot (I tried to put another word here, but IMDb did not allow it..) so it pains me to say this, but it cannot be denied that he is one of the most talented writers/directors of all time. He just is. The film was exceptional - from the moment it started it was beautifully shot, comical, vengeful, well-written, fast-paced and full of tension at the appropriate times.

That's him. I do hate Tarantino for getting so much involved in a movie like an attention seeking teenager with lack of self esteem. But I love him for creating such original, provoking, entertaining and brilliantly acted form of modern art. What this time struck me, is Tarantino's tribute to Italian artists with the padre of Spaghetti Western, Sergio Leone, as well as Sergio Corbucci, who directed the original Django, starred by Franco Nero who had a small cameo appearance. The unique melodies of Ennio Morricone dominated again as the perfect soundtrack of Django Unchained while Elisa (Ancora Qui) song deserves credit if not an award. If you, like myself, hate Tarantino for being cocky and showing off, Django Unchained will give you a noisy slap on your face and make you love one of the best directors of the past decades.",

817,5 January 2021,dsims37,1, Insanely over rated.,"First off let me make it clear that this is a superb masterpiece that should have wiped the floor at the Oscars. There is more power, tension and drama in a couple of minutes of DiCaprio and a skull than in the whole of Argo. So whats so good about this film. Firstly its just a great story - a retelling of the Siegfried legend set against a backdrop of slavery and bounty hunting in the deep south of the US, just before the civil war. It is also a love story, a pupil / surrogate father figure story and perhaps most importantly a brutal account of the horrors of slavery. The second thing that is outstanding is the screenplay. It is littered with quotable lines, from the funny: ""That house we just left from, is The Big House. Big Daddy call it that cause it's big."" to the plain scary: ""If you examine this piece of skull here, you will notice three distinct dimples"". In fact the screenplay is so good almost the whole thing is quotable. The final ingredient of this unforgettable film is the casting/acting which produces some wonderful characters: Dr King Schultz, a civilised, cultured bounty hunter, who although he has told Django that he must stay in character just cant do it himself when confronted with Candy's cruelty. Stephen, a brilliant personification of evil by Samuel l Jackson, the moment when Stephen sees Django approaching on a horse is an astonishing bit of acting, essentially with only the eyes. The eponymous Django who through a kind of right of passage changes from a scared slave to a vengeful hero. And perhaps I leave the best to last, the francophile Calvin Candy: DiCaprio captures deep evil and menace.",

But Im gonna disturb the status quo and say that this time Tarantino got it wrong. Not cool. I love most of Tarantino, and this movie started actually OK, if somewhat incredulous, until they got to Mr. Candie, when it took a turn for the worse. I accepted a lot loose ends, such as how come from a slave that wasn't allowed anything even to ride on a horse, he was suddenly good at riding a horse and shooting like John Wayne? Or what was happening to the bodies they were accumulating? Or how come Mr Schults was so damn sure about everybody's course of actions as to enable him to be so cocky? And how come James Remar gets killed at the beginning then gets to be another character later on, this wasn't a comedy sketch? Or how come the black women in Mr Candies establishment Cleopatra club were all wining, dining and dressed and behaving like white ladies if they were slaves and therefore beneath them? But when Mr Candie appeared, it just took the biscuit, I thought Caprio was so miscast in the role, his southern accent was absolutely horrendous to my ears (Im no expert) and he looked so uncomfortable in them period clothes. He wasn't at all menacing, which I thought he was supposed to be, not even when he threw a bit*h fit at the dinner table. I admit I found it so boring that after the part Django surrendered, I just skimmed through till the end, but enough to see a Tarantino putting on an, what it seemed, English accent or something? He looked and sounded ridiculous! Another ridiculous sight was Django, now a free man, choosing his own clothes, ending up choosing to look like a buffoon in bright blue. Damn funny that was! Same for Samuel Jackson in that role of the demented, dunno, administrator? He was so annoying and may I dare, ugly as hell. I didn't mind the N word or the violence and brutality, after all this was expected in a movie about slaves. The part where it didn't make much sense to me was buying Django's wife. If they were prepared to pay top dollar for her, why didn't they just offer Candie top dollar for her instead of putting up all that farce about buying a wrestler? And why were Candie and Jackson ticked off about it, since there were merely doing business? But if they did that we wouldn't have had the pleasure of seeing all that guts and brains spilled all over Candie's sister lovely hallway, now would we! I have now become convinced that Tarantino loves violence and brutality in general, but particularly against women, and since he cannot act on it, putting it in his movies seems the best choice.

Laolai is a crafty, ruthless slave owner businessman, living in the slave owner family, he has become cruel and numb, he adapted to the environment of the game rules, and play well, because he also has his own principles.

Then comes the climax of the movie, which is the most thought-provoking part of the whole movie. Laolais prided himself on being a winner, lavishly treating the dentist to cake and letting the musicians play Beethoven's ""to Alice"", showing the winner's grace and respect for his opponent. Hearing the tune, the dentist was lost in thought, and the image of the gladiator named d 'addario being torn apart by a vicious dog came to mind. Beethoven and dumas were both pioneers of freedom and equality. ! D 'addario's name as gladiator is an insult to dumas.
A wave of grief and resentment rose up in the dentist's mind, and the disgust made him decide to distance himself from laolai -- sorry, I'm not your type. So he stopped the musician from playing and angrily went into the study. Feeling angry that the dentist had lost the duel, laolai went into his study to console him so that he could enjoy the satisfaction of winning. But he was wrong. In his own eyes, the dentist was a sore loser, and in the eyes of the dentist, he was a dirty winner.
Laolai angry, everyone in accordance with the rules of the game to play this game, as the winner, I already respect you, with what you can't give me respect? So he insisted that the dentist shake hands to complete the deal.
As the dentist reached for the steps, I thought for a moment that he was going to cave. But he could not resist the question of principle.
Would I have fired the shot? I don't know. Probably not. Admire him! Then a burst of light sadness, for their own gradually lost blood.
The rest of the story is a little bit cheesy,",

The style of this movie that Tarantino uses is great and you can tell that this is his movie. The acting is great and the action is fantastic. Django Unchained offers a very realistic point of view on slavery without being totally down beat.,

This isn't so much cashing in but more about QT and his incredible ego. He has made a name for himself and sometimes he deserves it. Not this time though. He isn't nearly as creative as he thinks he is. It's worth seeing but I wouldn't pay top dollar. Just wait for Redbox or Netflix. The acting was outstanding in many parts and the script was true Tarantino. I just wish he hadn't made such a mirror-image of Inglorious Bastards. This ended up being an offensive and weirdly racist movie with so much of the history of slavery being completely made-up and absurd. That technique worked once with Inglorious Bastards but is just tiresome seeing it again.,

He asks if Django knows the Brittle Brothers and with the affirmative, he kills one of his masters and takes Django for himself, but treats him like an equal. Then Dr. Schultz tells that he is a bounty hunter chasing John, Ellis and Roger Brittle and proposes a deal to Django: if he helps him, he would give his freedom, a horse and US$ 75.00 for him. Django accepts the deal and Dr. Schultz trains him to be his deputy. They kill the brothers in Daughtray and Django tells that he would use the money to buy the freedom of his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who is a slave that speaks German. Dr. Schultz proposes another deal to Django: if he teams-up with him during the winter, he would give one-third of the rewards and help him to rescue Broomhilda. Django accepts his new deal and they become friends. After the winter, Dr. Schultz goes to Gatlinburgh and learns that Broomhilda was sold to the ruthless Calvin Candie von Shaft (Leonardo DiCaprio), who lives in the Candyland Farm, in Mississippi.

Just another Masterpiece from the Legend Tarantino.",
856,5 October 2021,saikatsamanta,10, Another Bloody Masterpiece from the Legend,"Tarantino is back in form with his ultraviolent blaxploitation drama. It is his first time delving into the Western genre and as usual he succeeds with boldness and brilliance. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, settings, costume, score and acting. The visual landscapes are outstanding. All actors involved deliver superlative performances. In particular DiCaprio, Waltz, Goggins, Foxx, Washington and Jackson are superb. The plot is set pre - Civil War and revolves around a recently freed slave named Django. He is freed, sort of, by a seasoned and cunning bounty hunter named Dr. Schultz. The two initially set out to capture three vicious and murderous brothers and are successful. The duo then continues to hunt bounties throughout the South. Eventually they land at the infamous plantation Candieland. Calvin Candie is a sinister racist that passes his time by holding ""Mandingo Fights"" in which two slaves face off in wrestling matches until the death with betting involved. Once there they find Django's long lost wife Broomhilda which has been Django's goal all along. This is when the cat-n-mouse and war of wills begins to rescue her. Calvin's house slave Stephen overhears a deal negotiated by Schutlz and puts a kibosh on the deal. This results in a duplicitous shootout with two main characters being dispatched. Django is captured, tortured and is removed from Candieland but through some chicanery he convinces the henchmen that are taking him away to return him to Candieland with the offer of great rewards. Once back at Candieland all hell breaks loose as everyone involved learns that Django is not a man to be trifled with. The plot is clever, funny, brutal, violent, unique, cathartic and has a bombastic ending. The film examines the obvious theme of racism. It also explores other themes such as just because Django is freed from his chains is his soul truly free and another is the scrutinizing of greed and power. This is a memorable and captivating film. To this day you'll hear fans of the film quote famous lines such as Django's, ""I like the way you die boy"". It ranks up with Tarantino's best and one of the very best in it's genre.",

But this was really the film that's started it Django Unchained is a masterpiece and my second favourite Tarantino movie falling just short of Inglorious Basterds for me. This movie just captures it's period so well to the point where you legitimately feel as if your in the west. Tarantino directs this film masterfully because he tried so many so things here he went for a faster pace and more action sequences and it all works and meshes well together. Jamie Foxx is fantastic in this movie because he acts just how he's supposed to as a real slave would in this situation and as he gradually talks more and acquires more confidence it feels gradual and makes for a greater performance. Christoph Waltz took home his second Oscar for this movie at he absolutely deserved it he's fantastic in this movie and steals every scene he's in almost. Leonardo DiCaprio is fabulous here as well playing the villain so perfectly to the point where I hate him I hate Leonardo DiCaprio that's unimaginable and in my opinion at least deserved an Oscar nomination. Tarantino usually likes to go for more dialogue sequences than action sequences but in Django Unchained he adds in more and it works there all filmed to perfection with intensity and ultimately there just really entertaining. The love story is where the film possibly could falter but know it works perfectly and its what gives the film it's heart and keeps it going.

870,20 January 2013,pincushion-581-874440,10, modern classic,"Believing all the media talk of excessive violence I went into Django Unchained expecting to see such gratuitous maiming and bloodletting that even for a Tarantino film it would be a new milestone. After seeing the film I wonder if the folks in the entertainment media have ever seen a Tarantino movie? Django is ""chock full of guts 'literally"" but no more so then Kill Bill pt.: 1. To be frank the big deal about the violence in this film was because of the ginormous elephant in the room when America has to face the shady side of its history in talking about slavery. Routinely this subject is skimmed over or swept under the rug as we believe in post racial America *wink* that we are the great big shining city on the hill without blemish. It's an uncomfortable topic for most. Staying true to form, Director Quentin Tarantino is not going to shy away from anything that makes you uncomfortable or squirm in your seat. He is the type of director that is going to take the uncomfortable stuff and throw it right in the audiences face. Django takes the uncomfortable stuff and puts it on display. It wraps it up in a biscuit (no pun intended) to make it go down easier but also making it memorable. This film is harsh in its depictions as it has enough N-Bombs to make any Antebellum South nostalgist feel right at home. I believe the N-bomb was used as a verb, adjective, and noun through out this film and it felt at times that some of the actors themselves had a hard time letting the word loose. Particularly Christophe Waltz who is magnificent in his Role as King Schultz the Dentist/Bounty Hunter. In my opinion that was the most difficult part of the film to get through but staying true to the time period it is the way things were. Especially in the ""Grand Ole"" state of Mississippi. The last time I heard the N-word that much was in the mini series ""ROOTS"". Although I can't say that Django is in the realm of Roots, in modern times I can say that it is an evolution of it with a different ending, As for the violence in the film if you are familiar with the history of slavery then the images portrayed should not come as a shock as in most cases the violence was much worse in reality than what was shown on screen. There were a few moments where ""I said oh my did they really just show that?' but that was in relation to how much flesh one can get away with showing on screen these days. If you can handle that then buckle your seats for the type of ride that only Tarantino can provide. The film is lengthy coming in at almost 2hrs&45 min with trailers but most of the dialog is so well written that you get disappointed when some of the scenes end. The story is simple in that Christophe Waltz plays a bounty Hunter who enlists the help of a slave named Django to assist in bringing in the lucrative bounty of three outlaws. The Rub is that Django can identify the outlaws because he was a slave on the plantation where the outlaws worked as overseers. Django is played by the multi talented Jaime Foxx who executes the role of Django superbly. In exchange for Django's help the bounty hunter agrees to help Django rescue his wife Broom Hilda from Calvin Candie, a Ruthless plantation owner. Broom Hilda is played wonderfully by the beautiful Kerry Washington. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Plantation owner and antagonist Calvin Candie to a twisted level in a role that sees him as the bad guy for a change. He plays this part masterfully. The cast of this film is excellent. Don Johnson and Jonah Hill make cameos so memorable you wish they had more screen time. Last but not least is the role of Stephen played by Samuel L. Jackson the long time Tarantino alum. Stephen is the head of all the house servants and Calvin Candies' most trusted adviser/personal attendant. The role of Stephen is a character so despicable that he may indeed be ""the worse Black man in the History of film"" as said by Samuel L Jackson. He is an ""Uncle Tom archetype who is a scene stealer as his dialog and portrayal by Samuel L. just dominate whenever he is on screen. No one uses the word mother F'er like Mr. Jackson and he does not disappoint. Stephen routinely uses his power to make life hell for the other slaves and is so in need of the master's approval that self-respect and personal pride mean nothing to him. He is truly the master's lap dog. The relationship between Stephen and Django make for some of the most memorable scenes in the film. It's strange experiencing a Tarantino film with so Linear A story line but it's no less exciting than any of his previous films. Django is a risky story to tell sure to anger some and be praised by others. However in the hands of a true craftsman and with noble intention this film shines in its honesty about the state of the world back then and also offers a small spoon of sugar to make the bitter pill go down easier. The true intention of this film comes shining through. Exploitation no. Entertainment and bit of indulgent fantasy yes. Imagine if Kunta Kente grabbed the whip from the overseer, whipped him back and kept his African name. Well that's the kind of world where Django Unchained exists. Django overall is a fantastic film in the same logic as Inglorious Basterds. Revisionist history may prove to be its own genre if it remains so entertaining in the hands of quality directors. 4 Stars. See for yourself",

877,27 May 2013,edcrimmins-880-780995,1, Not worth your time.,"In Django Unchained writer/director Tarantino tends to impress then fail miserably throughout the film. The storyline concerns a German bounty hunter (Waltz) who frees a slave (Foxx) with the intention of using him to track down The Brittle Brothers. Waltz then proceeds to help Foxx rescue his wife from a ruthless plantation owner (DiCaprio). It is blatantly unfortunate to see how important Sally Menke, Tarantino's deceased Editor and ""greatest collaborator"", was at shaping the films which he wrote and directed. The editor who assumed the late Menke's role was Fred Raskin, whose filmography contains such fast-paced flicks as the The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), Fast and Furious (2009) and Fast Five (2011). The title says it every time, ""fast"", and Raskin who is obviously used to quick cutting brings an uncharacteristic pace to the film when compared to Tarantino's previous work. Right from the first scene it is evident that Raskin deviated from Tarantino's previous stylistic goals while editing the first cut during production. In the initial scene the pace of the editing is far too quick and the focal points tend to jump all over frame between these quick-cuts; ultimately disorienting the viewer and does not achieve what he could have been delivered more powerfully. Tarantino could fix only so many problems with Raskin's work, and since film is a collaboration he clearly had to compromise in certain areas. Compounded upon the shoddy editing, we have some pretty awful music choices which detract from the film and present no added benefit, albeit the opening theme is superb. There truly is a better film hiding in-between the poor editing and improper music choices. I'd say give Django a watch, if only to listen to the great dialogue... Take it this way, if I was blind this film would have come off much better. From the great highs to the unforgivable lows, Tarantino's sly cameo is one of the more entertaining moments where he refers to Django as ""black"", and not as a ""n****r"" like everyone else. Overall, Django Unchained only succeeds in being offensive, failing atrociously where Tarantino's films have flourished so well in the past. However, with my pretensions aside, one cannot deny Taratino's deft skill as a controversial and entertaining film-maker. S",

This movie is nothing to me but a cheap brand of cow manure, I have no idea why everyone said this movie was good.

The only characters I remember finding interesting were the bounty hunter, played by Christoph Waltz and the henchman played by Samuel L Jackson, they are interesting but they aren't enough to save the movie.

It's become commonplace to fall in love with his films, and then swiftly disregard them as the the exploitative rip-offs that they have become; films that riff off the success of Pulp Fiction. So, in some ways, Django is almost a return to form for the director, even if it still does contain a few of his tedious trademarks that he's developed.

887,26 January 2013,Bar_N,5, Not what was expected,"The movie is great - I don't like it. But that can be explained. Well - I like Tarantino movies, I adore them even. Bad thing he does not make more of them. Undoubtedly the most successful one so far was Pulp Fiction, it's a cult classic. It just has great actors and a huge number of really classic scenes in it. A famous movie scene has something magical about it. It not only has an impact while it lasts, it also has an impact on the whole movie: Before the scene you kind of look forward to it, then you like it while it happens and then the impression even lasts after the scene. That is the kind of magic that makes you watch movies over and over again thus making it a true cult movie. However human nature has it, that good emotions have a smaller impact on us than bad emotions. You can have the most sensual experience with the most stunning girl - you would not want to have it in exchange for HIV, just the thought of it would turn you off, right? You would not want to have the nicest imaginable sensation on your skin if you had to except the worst imaginable or painful sensation on your skin afterwards. The need to avoid the bad emotion is much more developed than the need to seek the good sensation. And this is not only true for a 1:1 comparison but also for a 1:10 ratio. You could enjoy your favorite most delicious spaghetti a hundred times - but if you bit on huge disgusting cockroach while enjoying our meal just once, you would not only stop enjoying the rest of your spaghetti but would probably condemn the whole place and never come back, no matter if all the previous meals were OK. Now what does that have to do with movies? Well, Tarantino movies are mostly filled with intriguing conversations or impressive violent scenes. Most of them are good and cause a sensation of excitement. You can see that actually by the reaction of the crowd in the movie theater. If a rapist gets struck with a ninja sword or Lucy Liu loses half of her brains in a sword fight or some poor gangster gets shot in the face on the back of a car and his brains splatter all over the place - funny enough everybody, including me, likes these scenes - you can clearly see that in the peoples faces and the sounds they are making: 'ouch!' or 'whohoooo' or 'damn! haha' . And as I said, a good scene not only last while it last, but influences the viewer before, while and after it happens. However, there are scenes, like the baseball bat scene in Inglorious Bastards and the mandingo Scene and the dog scene in Django that do not seem to entertain the audience in the same way. You don't hear an 'ouch!' or 'whohoooo' or 'damn! haha' - what you hear is complete silence! It's like suddenly people are not watching Tarantino anymore but more like everybody is forced to watch a scene from Schindlers List. You are not entertained, not the slightest bit - you are deeply disgusted. That is not what you have come for. You will not look forward to that scene in the future, you will want to avoid it! This scene is not neutral or dull, it is the cockroach in your spaghetti and no mater how good the rest might be, it will have spoiled the whole thing forever. Now how can a cinematic genius as I always like to think of Tarantino, make such a huge mistake? It seems as if he blindly stumbles through a minefield of dreadful ideas for showing violence and was magically able to avoid all mines in Pulp Fiction while treading on one or two mines in the last two movies. Don't get me wrong - those movies might still have very high viewer counts initially, but they will not be seen repeatedly for the above mentioned reason. Which is sad. I liked to think, those mistake are just bad luck, but then I saw an interview with Tarantino the other day. He was talking about violence in Django and he even mentioned that he did show the movie to a test audience and he saw the reaction during the mandingo fight and the dog scene and realized that he had to 'cut the scenes' since they seemed to be too much for the audience. Jesus! You can't help the problem by cutting the scene. Just like cutting a cockroach in half and putting it in the spaghetti wouldn't help the smallest bit. The scenes just have a totally different quality, no matter how much of it you actually show in pictures. Even if you did not show a single picture of the mandingo fight at all and would only have the happenings narrated or hinted at: 'Here we have a man squashing a helpless mans eyes out and then bashing his whimpering, struggling even more helpless skull in with a hammer while the audience is cheering and applauding'. Just knowing that these events take place would cause a bitter silence in every movie theater no matter how much of it was actually shown. I for one don't want to see that again. Why do we perceive certain types of exaggerated violence with excitement while other forms seem to stun and disgust us deeply? In short you could say that the a bad scene is not too violent, but rather violent plus way too mean. Please Mr. Tarantino, go back to the sickness of Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill that most people like so much and only some stupid people criticize you for. No more cockroaches in your delicious meals. They destroy the whole thing.",

If U haven't seen this genre before, you'll say it's a very good movie, but for me, nothing new here. Nothing of great significance here except the music and a handful of scenes.As for the scenario, it was a shallow one, not like what i expected from Tarantino as he always pushed the envelope too far in his perspective regarding the themes he presents in his movies (e.g. Inglourious Basterds) and which is a characteristic of QT that made him distinctive, and sure not an Oscar-worth-nomination scenario. As for Performances (which was the second element that disappointed me), no one gave a captivating performance except, and to my surprise, Samuel L. Jackson, which did a fine supporting role deserves recognition, Jamie Foxx wasn't the suitable lead, he didn't give a performance to engage the viewer with his story as the black hero trying to free himself and his wife from slavery; Waltz gave a weaker performance that his previous effort in Inglourious Basterds, DiCaprio did a good job but not what i expected from what i saw in the trailers due to his one dimensional character, the only role that took my attention was Samuel L. Jackson as Steven the Butler. Tarantino made an appearance which is the worst I've ever seen. What i said earlier concerning the scenario, can be said for direction; the movie lacked Tarantino's special view in direction which we usually see in his movies, even the camera work wasn't that special.

Tarantino has been candid of his admiration for Sergio Leone and this work will make his precursor proud.
Tarantino has woven action, laughs, thrills and adventure into to the story of a slave who is emancipated by a bounty hunter in search of outlaws. Rather than proving to manifest perils and atrocious reflections of a liberated slave the movie delves into an entertaining spectacle.
The movies cult status was affirmed by performances of Di Caprio and Christopher Waltz. Waltz performance as Dr Schultz of German origin never betrayed the German pedigree thoroughly deserved his Oscar. Di Caprio has proven why he is the best in business by portraying Calvin a barbaric, tyrannical and imperious master. The presence of Jamie Foxx draws parallel with Clint Eastwood from the Dollars Trilogy where his guns do the talk.

I couldn't decide between Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained. Django Unchained has some stuff that I haven't seen from Tarantino. Such as a moving love story. It didn't have that dark and gritty feel Basterds had, but instead had a lighter heart of a movie at times. Such as teaching Django how to be a bounty hunter or the ""Bag"" Scene. It felt like a 60's western at times which made it great. The performances were outstanding which my favorite being from Christoph Waltz, while Samuel L Jackson and Leonardo DiCaprio were also very good. A lot of great lines in this movie such as ""the D is silent"" or ""if you insist"" or ""I couldn't help myself"". Jaimie Foxx was great also playing the perfect Django.There were great cameos too. The movie had a lot of great directorial shots such as showing the foam being taken off the top of the beer showing Quentin's true vision which is so magnificent. The scene with The Candy-land Shooting was my favorite because of the suspense and action. Matches up to the Bar Mexican shootout in Inglourious and in my opinion better and bloodier. I think this movie will do great at the Oscars, maybe winning best picture because of the Zero Dark Thirty. I think the best supporting actor Oscar should go to Christoph Waltz personally(then for both of the Tarantino movies hes in he would have an Oscar). But I wouldn't mind if Leo won because I have never seen him act like this before, its not his best performance but maybe my favorite character of his, showing off his true acting talent. The movie is so exciting and entertaining and really made you feel like you were with Django following him on his epic journey. You must see this movie before I spoil anymore.

An instant classic and a highlight for his career, Django unchains itself from comparison to any other film, it's magnificent characters, astonishingly detailed writing and moments of shock are so out there. Christoph Waltz can do no wrong, he is an actor with talent through the roof, and his latest performance as Dr. King Schultz catapults him further to one of the beat actors status, yes I am a fan. Same goes to Jamie Foxx, he plays vulnerable and unsure to start with yet as he gets closer to the end of his revenge journey as Django, he becomes confident and flamboyant, Foxx is impeccable here. Leonardo DiCaprio is almost unrecognisable in terms of behaviour and attitude, he is superb as a nasty piece of work Calvin Candy, a slave ranch owner. Samuel L Jackson, Walton Goggins and Kerry Washington add more star power to this marvel of a movie, Tarantino's writing and characters here at what drive this adventure, yet the intensity and horror of slavery also has strong authority on screen amongst the stars, as well as some exciting moments of action and well staged gun fights.

942,15 May 2015,JamesIan2021,9, So Damn Good,"From the day I heard about this movie (this was still when Will Smith was in talks for the lead role), I knew I had to see it. That was almost three years ago, and finally it has come. This movie, a twisted, bloody, alternate-history story about a slave seeking revenge on his wife's captors, is one of the best movies to come out in recent memory. It is also one of the best Westerns I have ever seen, only behind Leone's ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly"" and Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"". It heavily borrows from the work's of Mr. Leone, and much like Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"", is largely a homage to his directorial style. Let me address some of the major complaints I've heard about this movie. I've heard that the movie is racist because of its heavy use of the n-word. I will not say the movie doesn't use it a lot, but this is a movie that takes place in 19th century Southern America. You don't have to be a history professor to know that this was not a kind place or time for African-Americans. Another complaint is the film's historical inaccuracy. And, while the film makes several anachronistic errors, it is important to remember that this is very much an exploitation movie. If a movie like Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"", a very serious film about World War 2, makes a mistake of this nature, then I see a point in pointing it out. But why, in a movie about a slave becoming a bounty hunter, is that important? And the only complaint I really had was the lack of clever dialog. There were many quotable one-liners, but there was a lack of the quirky and delightful conversations that Mr. Tarantino is famous for. Now the numerous things I liked about ""Django Unchained."" The movie borrows heavily from Sergio Leone, enough that I wish Mr. Leone was still alive so I could hear his opinion of it. It was well shot, but a scene that stood out was the final gunfight in Candyland. This was one of my favorite movie shootouts ever. The soundtrack is also incredible- there's some Ennio Morricone, a great opening song, Jim Croce, and even a James Brown/ 2pac mashup! The acting was great, but the two stand-out performances, to me, were those of Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. DiCaprio plays a fantastically over the top villain that reminds me of Dennis Hopper in ""Blue Velvet"", or Gary Oldman in ""The Professional"". Sam Jackson plays a house slave that is an interesting and unlikeable character. I particularly liked that Jackson did a role that seemed very much unlike him. This movie already picked up some Golden Globes, and with the Oscars not too far in the future, we are left to wonder how ""Django"" will fair. I can only hope for the best, but I believe the Oscar crowd will once again be afraid to give a daring movie such as this one the recognition it deserves.",

951,27 March 2013,buzz_ukuk,7, An entertaining yarn worth at least one viewing,"Jamie Foxx is excellent in this movie and he moves through the complex layers of the role with ease. The actor who plays Dr. Schulz also conveys the transition from bounty hunter looking for information to mentor/parter to person who cares about what happens to Django realistically and authentically. Another reviewer mentioned the cameos of familiar faces negatively but I found them extremely enjoyable. I've heard and read the words ""slave revenge fantasy"" thrown around in reference to the movie and also read that this movie dishonors African American ancestors. I also noted in previous reviews that there were some objections to the ""cartoonish"" aspect of some of the scenes. As an African American, I would not have been able to or even have wanted to see this movie without those features. I find it excruciating to view movies that relate the horrible, devastating experience of slavery in a realistic way. As it was, during some of the flashback scenes such as when Broomhilda is being flogged, the view of Django's ankles when the chains were removed, and when D'artangan was being ripped apart, I was brought to tears, because as we all know, these events actually occurred to fellow human beings. While others may have found the mildly comedic scenes cartoonish and jarring, I found them necessary, because just as the scenes became too painful to bear, there would be a humorous or humorously ironic scene inserted there in a manner that flowed well to me. Kerry Washington did not have a lot of dialogue, however,I did not feel that her skills were wasted because of this. Only an actor of her caliber could have put done so much with so little dialogue. She conveyed pain, heartbreak and joy in a very powerful, meaningful way. The entire cast was excellent. I found this movie to be another reason for me to be in love with QT. I thought he treated the subject matter respectfully and I am grateful for the ""slave revenge fantasy"". It was very cathartic. I found Django to be funny, moving, action packed and a great experience with which to bring my Christmas Day to a close.",

954,23 March 2022,liamshirazi,10, Stylized violence meets gripping western movie,"Nowadays it is very hard to bring important messages via cinematography without making the audience bored. Representatives of Gen Z who spend most of their time surfing the internet are used to receive ""quick"" information from many different sources without getting into further details. That's why the approach of making long films without action is inappropriate for them. A case in point is the following question. How many young people watched ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" or ""To Kill a Mockingbird""? These films are really important and devoted to social inequality and social just.
Quentin Tarantino who is famous for bloody actions films filled with black humor and irony provides us with alternative approach in conveying important messages to the viewers. One of my favorite films directed by Tarantino is ""Django Unchained"". This film is devoted to the theme of discrimination and slavery in the US in 19th century. Events described take place in the US before the Civil War where German bounty hunter dr. Schultz and Django, former plantation worker unchained by Schultz, are looking for the Django's wife who was sold to another slaveholder. Tarantino, not bounded by public opinion or liberal Hollywood producers, shows us the whole cruel picture of American slavery with brutal whipping, shackling, hanging, beating, mutilation and imprisonment. Once you have seen this film, you will never treat discrimination like something appropriate for human community. You will really understand that providing equal opportunities for everyone is the only one way for humanity to develop.

971,20 June 2013,smith1987,7, in simple just go for it,"The end of another year and lots of movies we've seen or still want to see. Our latest choice was to see what Jamie Foxx would do with his role as the slave Django in Django Unchained. Quentin Tarantino apparently set out to out-Western every Western ever made, and out-bloody every bloody shootout ever filmed, Western or cops-and-robbers or whatever. It was a humorous satire with an underlying morale theme. The humor was seen in the outlandish outfits Django chose to wear, especially the Blue Boy suit he picked out when Dr. King Schulz (Christoph Walz), Django's savior, lets him choose anything he wants as his new wardrobe. More humor in the choice of background music as stereotyped by all the Clint Eastwood spaghetti Westerns of yesteryear, the incompetent band of KKKers who decide to forgo their head bags because they can't see what they were doing, the overblown scenic views too perfect to be real (the mountains, the rocky campsites, the bar with beer taps and glass mugs, the unlikely number of plantations underlings who respond to the shooting in the plantation mansion at Candyland, the amount of horrific blood-shedding in that final shootout, the high-stepping routine Django goes into with his horse as he shows off for his wife Broomhilda at movie's end. But always, beneath the humor and satire, is the indictment of an institution like slavery, an institution that too many antebellum whites could condone, could unthinkingly, inhumanely, believe that a human being could be owned, a piece of property to whom the owner could do anything with impunity. The acting was excellent—Walz as the ex-dentist bounty hunter, DiCaprio as the effeminate Calvin Candie, Foxx as the ""fastest gun in the South,"" and Samuel L. Jackson as the truly evil reverse ""Steppin Fetchit"" house slave. But Christoph Walz is the best and will probably receive a nomination is the Oscar race.",

This trademark is something that hasn't worked in his favour every time; his inherent fanboyism, passion for exploitation cinema and auteur style was something that came to bear (and not for the better) in his half of 2007's 'Grindhouse', 'Death Proof', an exercise in self-indulgence that is easily the worst film he's directed. But we cannot forget that he has delivered three slices of brilliance – 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' and the often-overlooked 'Jackie Brown'; a trio of movies that exemplify the talent he possesses. However, talented director doesn't always equal great film and Mr. Tarantino is now exception to this, as following the rather good 'Kill Bill Vol One', he made the decidedly 'meh' follow-up, the frankly bad 'Death Proof' and the just alright 'Inglourious Basterds', which may have been poor as its predecessor had it not been for Christoph Waltz and those two scenes.

But, nevertheless, its Quentin Tarantino, so i respect the way he wanted it to be. Watching it, i have to say that the film was an n-word warfare, while raining blood and guts.. I enjoy gore in films, but i think there was more than enough blood when a person was shot. I mean, people got shot and blood fountains came out of their wounds..!

The plot is incredible, while we first see an illiterate, bruised slave, we see him rise up, metaphorically and physically break his chains time and time again, and end with him dancing around on his horse, after exploding the home of the plantation owner that once opposed him.",

I also appreciate the cinematography and camera work. The postion and choices the team made were finominal and carefully made. I liked the soundtrack of this movie and in each scene the music matched perfectly. Only one problem is that I wish we could have got more backround on Broomhilda because this would have gave more reason for the watcher to see a good ending for her despite there already being many this could have given more making this film even better.

I must confess I've never taken strongly to westerns but boy, did this film impress me. For me, the movie is about blending at the very least 3 elements - a subverted form of reality which challenges our fixed and deep rooted notions, our inner reality manifesting itself in bizarre and almost heroic decisions and actions, and the ugly reality of how things really are, to create a scintillating, at time surreal, and an almost comic effect. Yes, the movie does come off as a little loosely strung, kind of patchy, with some parts accelerating with great velocity, while others seem to crawl..In that sense, the movie is a wonderful series of well-shot scenes. The acting by at least the main is almost flawless...I particularly liked Jamie Foxx's character...his naivete and yet his struggle to assert his individuality in the light of his new found freedom have been brilliantly portrayed by the director and the actor...a job well done All in all, its hard to go wrong with Tarantino when it comes to entertaining his audience. For me, the even greater takeaway was the subversion of reality as we have been made to understand it..Its difficult to explain, easier to be experienced. Kudos to Tarantino and all the people behind this movie..9/10 on entertainment value, and the kind of freshness which very few can bring to the movie screen",

996,23 July 2020,goat-04054,9, A very good modern 'western',"Very much enjoyed the style, the action scenes, and the character development as well as the cinematography. The fights were gory but in a sort of comical way rather than a disturbing way. Jamie fox does great, and so does the actor for Dr. Schultz. My only criticism is that there's a lot of swearing, but it's probably fitting for such a story. Samuel L Jackson does great on his character, making you despise him til the end and leaving no room for empathy, even as he's dying on the floor. Leonardo DiCaprio also gets into his role, and it's fun to see such a unique portrayal from him. The camerawork was elite, and brought some much needed comedy into such a serious movie. Also it's very recognizable. Also the dialogue was meaningful in the film, unlike other action movies where you're just supposed to figure out why stuff happens as it happens.",

I enjoyed Jamie Foxx's performances in The Kingdom & Law Abiding Citizen, but this was another level. I know little of Waltz apart from his part in Inglorious Basterds & it is clear that he is an outstanding actor, his dialogue keeps the viewer engaged. I also have to mention that Di Caprio was brilliant, as always, & Jackson's character was hilarious (I shan't say too much). I loved this film so much that i simply had to go & buy it the day it was on the shelves! Tarantino has smashed it again, never fails to impress, & loved the little cameo too.

Christoph Waltz continues to impress with his acting skills, I thought he would not better his portrayal of Col. Hans Landa but I am proved pleasantly wrong. Their are some real standout performances from DiCaprio and Jackson as the thoroughly nasty servant and Foxx gives his best performance to date. Don Johnson was particularly good as Big Daddy and the holes in the bed sheets KKK styley scene was particularly amusing. Tarantinos's direction and moreover his script were both top draw and the humour was both funny and black n brutal. The film itself is over 2 1/2 hours long but the time just flys by, always the mark of a quality film. Even the music in a bizarrely 'they call me trinity' fashion is a triumph. I can't really think of a criticism to level at this film as it really is that entertaining. However I would suspect that a number of sensitive souls of a PC nature will find the language a bit much and no doubt civil rights will be mentioned by some sad souls, who cannot distinguish entertainment from reality.",

It is set during the slave period of the US south and there are very graphic depictions of the physical violence used during that time. Jamie Foxx does a fine job as Django, a slave required by a bounty hunter Dr King Shultz, played by Christoph Waltz, to identify brothers that are wanted for crimes. As Django and Shultz team up the movie unfolds with much violence and use of the ""N"" word. It reaches a point where Dr Shultz is killed and that is where the movie ends in my mind. Shultz was by far the most interesting character in the movie and after his death, I did not care anymore. Leonardo DiCaprio overplayed his role as he can easily do as a villainous slave and plantation owner. Actors Samuel Jackson and Don Johnson both were excellent in their respective roles but Christoph Waltz was the standout in this film and as mentioned, after his death, there is no movie anymore.",

I have to admit other favorites of mine are Schindler's List (1993) and The Pianist (2002) If you were to ask me for my 2nd favorite movie it would be Inglourious Basterds (2009). The trick to this movie is not to watch it for a couple years. When you watch this after a while; it will bring you to such a pinnacle of rejoicing of righteous indignation; it is incomparable to any movie made to man. Django's love for Broomhilda Von Shaft being his saving grace and ultimate power accessibility is the story of the history of man. The very center point being; the love of a man to the love for a woman, being the culmination of the retribution of a entire population of a oppressed people is absolutely believable and that is why you cannot deny the infallibility of the message of this script.

If you just love Tarantino, then you will love this film. Plenty of cursing, blood, gruesome violence - all the things that make his films memorable. In the second half of the film, I got the feeling he was trying to break a world's record for how many times he can squeeze the ""n"" word into the script.

1033,31 December 2012,EvilMissQB,8, Lots of fun - possibly a bit much if you are sensitive,"The most fun I've had in the cinema probably ever. I remember thinking halfway through the film ""dont f**k this up Tarantino"", I was very excited I was almost in tears. It's a rich film with outstanding attention to detail in the set and costume design and also the over-the-top characters. Really top notch adult entertainment at its best. Unfortunately the curse of self indulgent Tarantino did rear its ugly head during the last half hour which is annoying when it was going so well. You can almost pin point the moment it turns. I heard an interview with the director recently where he says he shoots his scenes in the order they appear in the film. If this is true then it might explain why the last part of Django feels over extended and ill fitting with the rest of the movie. You can tell so much that Tarantino loves to direct, he loves the hands on, maybe he just doesn't want the process to end. He definitely shouldn't have appeared in it. I don't really have a problem with the over the top shoot out but it may have been a little immature and blood thirsty in places. It's never sick because you (or rather I did) start to get desensitised to the excessive violence and that's a problem. It just feels out of place when compared to the rest of the film. Loved the music all the way through. Didn't like scurrying men like kill bill. Loved Candy. L Jackson OMG, legend. Loved swirling smoke over Djangos hat. It's so good I can't stop thinking about it. Me and my girlfriend were like excited school kids leaving the cinema. She agreed with me that the last 20 or 30 mins let it down somewhat. It's a shame but I guess that's tino for ya. He probably gets off on the splatter stuff. It's all real not CGI which is nice. It's weird when I was watching the massive bloody shootout it made me feel very weird like a kind of adrenaline high my forehead pricked with sweat. All that blood its strangely intimate. I felt like I could have blushed like I was seeing a personal side to the director I didn't like but at the same time was massively engulfed in the woozy feeling. Black magic.

One of the best and bloodiest westerns ever made. The story is that Tarantino wanted to make a modern spaghetti western and while the music definitely fits this genre, the rest is blockbuster material that the old westerns couldn't touch. The characters have depth, the acting is top-notch and the story is compelling and adventurous, with a healthy dash of humor, some intriguing mind games and a wagon-full of action. It's actually a little funny that it's titled after Django, as his partner (played amazingly by Christopher Waltz) steals most of the scenes and without him the story wouldn't even exist. I'm not really a Tarantino buff, so I can't say how this compares to his other films, but I will say he likes blood - every gunshot caused a fountain to go off. This film got a lot of press for the generous use of the N-word so if that bothers you, steer clear (it's probably uttered evenly between whites and blacks throughout the film).

1055,30 December 2012,joshua-hardy56,10," Django is about slave turned bounty hunter who sets out to rescue his wife with his mentor. The movie is ride from start to finish, and the wins are not silent.","Don't get me wrong, I love Quentin Tarantino. I believe he's a very gifted screenwriter and director who comes up with great material back to back to back. Ever since I saw Pulp Fiction I thought that he is the greatest thing to happen to movies and inadvertently forced every movie since to be better and better as people tried to match his genius and quick wit. So when I went to see Django Unchained, his latest opus set in the wild, wild west, I immediately jumped at the chance to see it. I know I had to prepare myself for the gore and the violence that have dominated his movies. Also, I had to prepare to sit through almost 3 long hours (in Unchained's case, 165 minutes) of film. Nowadays, every single movie I see seems to get longer and longer and it's getting harder and harder to sit through them whether it's because the theater seats are uncomfortable, or the audience is restless, or the previews and commercials take about 20 to 30 minutes in addition to having to wait 30 minutes in line to get into the theater so by the time the movie opens my expectations are pretty damn high. Sometimes I have to remind myself what is it that I came to watch in the first place. Now, Django Unchained starts pretty strong actually. And I mean that in a good way. The premise is set early by a group of slaves, chained together, transported through rocky mountains and beautiful, harsh landscapes and guided by two cowboys riding on horseback. We see them walk long days and endless nights for miles on end. Among them is Jamie Foxx as Django, a quiet and beaten down slave who bears the marks of a brutal slashing on his back. Right there, without saying a single word, Quentin has managed to set the mood early on and indicated clearly who is the protagonist of the story. Without a single word, we learn that he's got a hard past, a past that will undoubtedly be revealed later in the film, a past that we are ever so curious to find out. His mission has been accomplished, he's got our attention. Then we're introduced to Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) and Quentin's script comes to life. It's a real treat as an aspiring writer and screenwriter to hear such great scripts and Unchained doesn't disappoint in that department. Christoph Waltz, who's been in Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds, plays his character with gusto and gives another unforgettable performance. He plays a bounty hunter that talks with such eloquence that you would never believe what he does for a living. Both Django and Dr. Schultz form an unlikely team, he teaches Django to what extend he can stretch his rights as a bounty hunter and a former slave. Django, now a free man thanks to him, has one purpose and one purpose only: to get his wife back. She has been sold to a plantation owner named Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). So far, so good, I'm all ears. The problem begins when Django and Dr. Schultz meet Calvin Candie. Mind you, Leonardo DiCaprio does an excellent job at portraying a man whose ambition and mischievousness can be seen in his eyes. He has finally abandoned his cute boy looks and trade them for those of a man with an evil purpose that can be seen and felt in his performance. However, the problem that I have with the script at this point was the excessive use of the N word. Now I understand that was part the lingo to refer to an African American slave at the time, however it comes a point when the word is heard so many times that it becomes tedious, heavy, almost uncomfortable to hear. In my personal opinion is a matter of taste more than accuracy. There is a difference between being accurate to being offensive, which was Quentin's intention here. Not only is this word uttered countless times in the script by white folk but we also have to hear this from Samuel L. Jackson's character, too. His character, Stephen, far from being compassionate towards Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), is really an ill-tempered curmudgeon that will stop at nothing to see her tortured for trying to escape the plantation that he runs for Calvin. That's not what bothered me about the character as much as his constant use of the N word. Coming from an African American, the word takes on a different meaning and maybe Quentin wrote this purposely to make a point. I could see many in the audience trying not to laugh whenever the word was said on screen, even if it meant to be funny. It made me wonder whether his intention was to entertain an audience or to make them uncomfortable. I believe that the latter was accomplished with Django Unchained.",

Broomhilda, Django's wife played by Kerry Washington does a good job as the damsel in distress. She doesn't have a lot of dialogue in the film but she did a fine job acting and really made her scenes count. I think one of the most interesting aspects of the movie is motivation behind Dr. Schultz on one hand he is a bounty hunter and the other he is also against slavery. Throughout the movie I kept asking myself if I was in that situation what would I do? I don't think it is fair to the people who had to experience slavery first hand to know exactly what I would do, but I think this movie forces you to question your own morals about the situations Django finds himself in. Calvin Candie's right hand man in this film and a key antagonist is Stephen played by Samuel L. Jackson. Another interesting relationship is that between Stephen and Django both hold significant power despite being African American and comparing the two is very interesting considering the time period and their roles in society.",

Smart dialogue, an incredible soundtrack, and more blood than all the horror flicks of 2012 combined are what usually make Tarantino's films so indulgently fantastic, the kind of movies that real movie-lovers love. And that's all here, with a double check on the amount of blood as Django teams up with a Dr. Schulz to rescue his wife from the hands of a mad man, and violently exacts vengeance on her captors. But Tarantino's films have also always featured strong, wonderfully defined performances, and there's no shortage here. Jamie Foxx as the vengeance-seeking Django, Christoph Waltz as the dentist-turned-bounty-hunter King Schultz, Leonardo DiCaprio as the violently eccentric plantation owner Calvin Candie, Kerry Washington as Django's lost love, and Samuel L. Jackson in a scene-stealing performance as Steven, Candie's right-hand man. That only Waltz managed to get Oscar's attention is a travesty. I would have given a nomination to Foxx, DiCaprio and Jackson as well, if I had the choice. Unfortunately, I don't. An incredible host of famous faces rounds out the epic cast, including a bit part by a lazy-eyed Jonah Hill and a hilariously explosive cameo by the director himself. Don't like Westerns, you say? This will be your exception, as it both affirms and breaks the sacred and longstanding rules of the genre, and throws in some new elements to redefine and reinvigorate (an Oscar-worthy original rap song, for instance).

The 10:00 AM Christmas morning premier of Django Unchained at a very large suburban Baltimore AMC Multiplex cinema was sold out. Not to worry, there is plenty more of Django to go around. Quentin Tarantino has given us the gift that keeps on giving. I believe that this was the first movie where I walked away wishing that I could read the book it was based upon. This will not happen anytime soon unless director/writer Quentin Tarantino releases Django Unchained as a novel. This story is not a remake of the 1966 ""spaghetti western"", Django starring Franco Nero. But I digress. Pulp Fiction thrilled most viewers, discounting the folks that showed up for Travolta's return to the big screen and found Tarantino a little too rich for their blood. Some of us rushed to see Reservoir Dogs and found our second Tarantino dish was a little rich for our taste. Moving on, I was first in line to see Jackie Brown. The umpire called a strike two on Quentin. Holy cow! And then along comes Kill Bill who knocks it out of the park. One more year and Kill Bill II would finish the set in fine fashion. Inglorious Basterds, the movie that changed so many spell checkers, was an anomaly. Quentin had the chutzpah to change history. Not everyone liked the fact that Quentin took the license to kill Adolph Hitler in this movie. By this time, I was swilling the Kool-Aid and let Tarantino drive the car. Django Unchained is more of the same, except better. The movie is funny, violent, profane, and remains true to the real evil slave-tender, i.e. the American history that sanctioned slavery. No need to make up any additional drama when it comes to a society that permits slavery. I counted (this is not official mind you) 66 times when the ""N"" word is dropped. This is perhaps the most wicked word in our vocabulary, and it is used with an excessiveness to remind us that the slavery-devil was calling the shots in 1858. Quentin drops Don Johnson into this story playing a wicked Tennessee plantation owner. Johnson is the trump card that QT holds with most of his movies. The question is, ""which tried and true actor is going to get a chance to let the public see them in the sunshine again""? Don Johnson is the winner of this role in Django. Christoph Waltz, a brilliant actor who had faded from Hollywood (and is another spell- checker destroyer) won the Oscar for his role in Inglorious Basterds. Kurt Russell, David Carradine, and John Travolta showed their fans that they had plenty of stuff left in their tanks. (David Carradine' s tank was officially emptied with his passing) The movie shows off the hard work that is synonymous with Tarantino movies. The clip of Waltz and Foxx riding their horses in a couple of feet of fresh snow in poor lighting feels like a segment that the crew worked too hard to edit out of the movie. That's just my guess. Django Unchained gets a lot of the silliness out of the way early, and allows the stars, Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Samuel Jackson to do what they do best. Act. And act they do. Please pick your favorite roll after seeing the movie. None will disappoint. Samuel Jackson may be the most ""out of character"" as a despicable employee of DiCaprio. Leonardo scene with the skull of ""old Ben"" is one of his best ever. As he slams his hand on the table, I only wonder if the resulting laceration was on purpose. Did Tarantino let the camera roll and capture the moment as the thespian plied his skill? I am a sucker for a director who has a list of actors that show up again and again in his movies. Tarantino's cast for Django is almost as large as the characters of the Bible. He pays respect to Franco Nero, the original Django. Michael Parks delivers the goods as always. Quentin's does a bang up job in his role as an Aussie. Simply put, Quentin does a bang up job with his gift of Django Unchained. Next: Kill Bill 3.",

Massive gun shooting scenes, blood everywhere, a cool soundtrack, all-you-can-eat. However, at the end, what is Django? A rude movie, with vile language, a bunch of well known actors, and a trivial story, the worn-out arsenal of the really great Quentin Tarantino? the wagon, once rushing, just stopped due overload, or someone forgot to fuel it with fresh coal. As attempt of redemption this movie really sucks, Jamie Foxx shots down every stereotype on his clownish crusade, if not Mr.Waltz had done it already. naive jokes are eroding any absurdity of real slavery in history. I bet Quentin would have accomplished a movie far better, more straight and provocative in his younger days, than this sweet-tempered, slobbering version of Django.",
1088,3 February 2013,westfield-john,5, Django lightweight,"Wow. I really can't think of another word that conveyed my emotions after leaving that cinema, to return to my normal day to day life. This movie, is probably the biggest hyped/controversial movie in recent cinema history, and it delivered on the hype. With the controversy adding more on top of the hype it was one movie I just couldn't miss. I was a bit iffy on the the main casting choice,of Jamie Foxx, but boy did he deliver. Christoph Waltz gives another sensational performance, I loved him in Inglorious and Tarantino wrote the part of Dr. King Schultz specifically for him. DiCaprio was sensational and he played the villain exceptionally. Django has something that extra that makes this movie arguably the best Tarantino movie. I think that it is definitely the best Tarantino movie since Pulp Fiction, but some people may argue that it surpasses Pulp Fiction, and that is a very hard thing to do. No matter the debate if it is the best Tarantino film ever, I salute you Mr.Tarantino, for a sensational story!",

Quinton himself went on the other side of the camera to give us a brief but very explosive performance. I'm belly laughing at people getting shot, maimed, and blown up as if I was watching Looney Tunes. But there's plenty of drama and character development to enjoy as well.

And though I was a little skeptical about this one, I knew it would be a big one. What I ended up thinking by the end of this movie was ""my Christmas was made."" ""Django Unchained"" is one of those movies where you have to appreciate the director's other work to appreciate this one. And if you're a true Tarantino fan, this movie will come close to your favorites. This movie offers all of the elements of a Tarantino movie at an extended level: There is an awesomely, extreme amount of violence which makes every one of them fun to watch; he gathers two of the best acting members of his entourage; and it's the classical revenge flick styles that he loves. The majority of the violence of this movie was done in the coolest ways ever. Some of them were a bit much, and some of them were done in a darkly funny way. I think it would probably be the second most violent Tarantino movie and the most violent Western I've ever seen. The actors were picked perfectly. Quentin brings back Christoph Waltz after he won an Oscar for his performance in ""Inglourious Basterds"". His performance is equally as good, if not better as he plays the role of Dr. King Schultz, a retired dentist- turned-bounty hunter who's determined to help Django rescue his wife. Tarantino's other golden actor, Samuel L. Jackson, gives off a solid role as Stephen, the very wise house slave that is skeptical of Django and Schultz. But the one performance that made the movie for me was perhaps my favorite actor, Leonardo DiCaprio, in his performance as the film's antagonist. His portrayal of Calvin Candie was the most swiftly crafted role of his career and he nailed it. And as a revenge flick, I thought this movie was written perfectly. This movie brings back the same feeling that Inglourious Basterds did. Considering the themes of ""Jews getting back at the Nazis"" and ""Blacks getting back at the slavers"", we can definitely see a third part to this major revenge series coming that Quentin has been making. The screenplay was written out so great that he made every minute of the movie, especially the dialogue which is traditional of a Tarantino movie, interestingly enjoyable.

Of course all of them including Django Unchained are not far behind. I think my only criticism of Django and some others is based on the same issue - QT has a tendency to oversell certain scenes and points. The easy to pick on ones from Django are the scenes with Big Daddy and his gang complaining about their hoods, and the Mandingo fighting. They could have been trimmed or in the case of the hood scene, cut altogether. Also the final scene at the dinner table hosted by Candie was unnecessarily long.

But I knew from the opening credits that this movie would be controversial and confusing at the same time.

I hate the ""montage"" many scenes are cut in the middle of a conversation and not shot as one piece, it's very annoying and it makes it seems like the movie was botched. The actors were great but a ridiculous scenario won't change anything. Like why would the German kill Calvin Candie if he were so smart?

Foxx Typhoons the big screen as our Black Hercules in Django Unchained.With the help of a retired dentist turned bounty hunter Django/Foxx sweet talks himself through deadly hurdles. The comic relief expressed in the movie served as a medium to give voice to the underlining theme of mental suppression. With a few twists and turns Django manages to forcefully break this cycle of suppression.One plus about this movie is that it was jam-packed with simply amazing actors.This movie is timeless. Just when you think you know its conclusion you experience a major twist of fate.Django is a must see 2012.,

In his latest revenge epic, Quentin Tarantino transports the audience to the American South in the waning days of slavery, to deliver an uncompromising tale of revenge, love, and morality. He does so in his usual fashion, with tremendous brutality and language amid wonderfully dressed settings and characters. It has all the staples of the Quentin that his audience loves, and while the revenge theme is becoming a little tiresome, the film is punctuated with magnificent performances that place it among the year's best films.",

Django had one crazy development that impressed me to the point I couldn't believe there would be a happy ending for him , but Tarantino managed to pull out a decent happy ending without making it boring or cliché.

I mean ill watch just about anything, but for me to think a movie was actually ""good"", takes a whole lot. DiCaprio was like i've never seen him before, and being one of my favorite actors, it was a little weird at first.

People complained about the number of times they said the word n*gg*r. That didn't really bother me. Its a movie about slavery. The usage did, it sounded to modern. It was funny, a whole theater full of people didn't bat an eye over a man getting beat to death. Yet they all jumped and cringed every time someone said n*gg*r. It was filled with the usual references and hommages to the genre Tarantino is ripping off. Like the cameo by ""Hang'Em Highs"" Bruce Dern.

The dialogue is fantastic, the pacing is terrific, the action is spectacular, and overall it's a very entertaining movie. Set in the Deep South and Old West, a freed slave (Jamie Foxx) embarks on a trail across America with a German bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) to rescue his wife from a charismatic and cruel plantation owner (Leo DiCaprio.)

It doesnt serve any purpose to advance the plot. Rather its QT indulging his penchant for meandering diatribes. Theres nothing daring or intelligent on offer. Frankly its painfully boring. If QT actually had any chutzpah he wouldve made something closer to the inspiration of this movie:Mandingo 1975 and Django 1966. The payoff isnt even worth it. The confrontation between Django and Calvin doesnt even occur. Its like QT didnt even bother to pay off the setup and lazily decided to fill up the third act with gun splatter gore. QT just lacks the patience or restraint to create a continous coherent narrative. He hasnt graduated from a series of skits stiched together by a thin plot populated by paper mache characters.

The movie was a masterpiece presentation of an update to the classic ultra-violent western movie, exceeding its goal as an action film and a thought provoking view of slavery. Although nowhere as intense as 12 Years a Slave, Django Unchained accomplishes everything it wanted to through the story of a bounty hunter named Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) and his fellow freeman Django (Jamie Foxx). The gunslinging pair sets out to find Django's wife (Kerry Washington) and becomes acquainted with psychotic and deranged slave owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is the owner of the massive plantation Candyland. Do not doubt that this movie is not original due to its western theme, it is an entirely new look at the awful era of slavery. The movie's characters are portrayed in some of the greatest acting I have ever seen, displaying the movie's plot with not a single loose end.

Leonardo DiCaprio is a white slave owner who thinks that black people are stupid because they don't gang up and beat their owners. Jamie Foxx shoots a lot of people and the shooting effects are very violent and the camera is very still which allows me too see the violence and soak in the violence which is pleasurable to my eyes. When people talk it makes me excited because the chances are very likely that Django or the white guy are going to slit someone's throat. In my memory of the film Django himself never actually talked. The white guy talked sometimes and Leonard DiCaprio talked the most. There was also a woman, and an old black man who looked a lot like Denzel Washington in prosthetics or maybe Morgan Freeman who makes everything go wrong.

Its complex, im not good with the names of the characters but Django seems to be the hero and his mentor, a germanic European native. The fact is when you watch the movie, each scene keeps the viewer tied into the plot. The comic style of quentin films are still in there. It was okay. A good movie if you like his filmography, which turned from suspense thrillers to non-sequential art with a action packed cowboys shoot em up style of directing. Maybe he concentrated more on the artsy aspects of film which let him lose the edge for another A grade movie. He got more simle and comic orientated in his films but stayed the same.

Jamie Foxx does a fine job as Django, a slave required by a bounty hunter Dr King Shultz, played by Christoph Waltz, to identify brothers that are wanted for crimes. As Django and Shultz team up the movie unfolds with much violence and use of the ""N"" word. It reaches a point where Dr Shultz is killed and that is where the movie ends in my mind. Shultz was by far the most interesting character in the movie and after his death, I did not care anymore. Leonardo DiCaprio overplayed his role as he can easily do as a villainous slave and plantation owner.

It was interesting to me to see the use of salesmanship and negotiation when getting out of tough situations. Behind all the blood and gore there is a sub story about how the power of love will make a man do anything. Some of the language in the movie is uncomfortable to hear, but I suppose it was valid for the setting of the movie 1850's before the civil war began.

The characters in the film are presented so well, their motivations and back story fleshed out nicely. You never have to guess who the bad guys are from the good. The action is fast, and bloody. The language is coarse, and funny at times. The soundtrack has a nice blend of western sounds and modern songs. The movie is an homage to spaghetti westerns from the past, and is overall very enjoyable. The camera cuts are nice and remind me of Kill Bill, Tarantino's earlier work. The camera at times zooms in on the character's faces as they are about to enter a showdown, or a pivotal moment. The movie does an excellent job at telling its story, and making you feel for Django. It has an excellent sense of intensity and triumph that is unmatched in many films today. After seeing this film, I was truly mesmerized, and had to watch it again.

1186,13 January 2013,muradmajid,9, Absolutely Brilliant!,"To say that ""Django Unchained"" is a revisionist revenge fantasy is beyond the obvious and besides the point. It is a visceral , outrageous , frightening , in some points hysterical movie that examines this country's history with racism and slavery that we still haven't worked through , and still bear the scars of. Who's to say that there wasn't a German bounty hunter roaming the old south in the days before the Civil War , and who's to say that he didn't employ a former slave as his assistant? OK , that probably didn't happen , but Quentin Tarrentino is an artist , and a very skilled one at that , so he takes some liberties , which pay off big in the end. The movie gives us scenes of the old south and slavery that we haven't seen before , frightening , ugly scenes , that may well have been the common , everyday experience for a lot of people , and puts it in the context of ""this is how it was , and this was the reality "" . He does it the style of the spaghetti western , and throws in some comic relief to take some of the pain away , which makes it a little easier to take , but it is still a highly disturbing vision , and can weigh on your mind long after the film is over, which is what good art is supposed to do. I saw this film at the theater when it first came out , and was troubled by it's brutality being shown as everyday life , but , I'm watching it on HBO now, of course the small screen will tone down some of the brutality , and the other aspects will come through, as the comic relief aspects , showing what a bunch of buffoons the ""poor white trash"" element could be, there is a ""Blazing Saddles"" sort of silliness to some of those scenes. To put it into perspective , ""Django Unchained "" , is an important film , trying to grasp an important topic , in a way we haven't seen in quite this way before. It's hard to watch in places , it is disturbing , but it makes you think , and that's always a good thing.",

1188,31 December 2012,killahbigmike,8, Shootout Scene?,"Quentin Tarantino's movie about slavery set in the mid 19th century caused quite an uproar at the time of release due to it being a genre movie. Several felt he wasn't taking the topic serious enough. Were they right? Yeah to an extent. Tarantino's favorite genre is the western/blaxploitation one and he continuously makes those kinds of movies. He loves revenge fantasies. So, he made this in those veins.
Basically, it is about a slave Django (Jamie Fox) who is freed from a previous owner by Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) who is a bounty hunter and he requires Django to find a couple of men who have a bounty on their head. Then they become friends and Schultz finds out that Django's wife is kept as a slave by Calvin Candie (Di Caprio) and they try to free her. It is a basic revenge story which has the usual Tarantino dialogue and violence. It is really bloody and there were moments where I couldn't watch it. The violence isn't the gritty serious type, but rather the fun one (Because it is fun, Janet!!!!).
I really enjoyed watching it. There were some really impressive set pieces and moments. The dialogue was sharp and quite funny. There were some quirky subtexts as well. The best part were the performances. Jamie Fox is great as he has the right mix of nastiness and naivety in him. Christoph Waltz plays a good guy version of Hans Landa and he is quite charming. He really has a wonderful screen presence. Di Caprio is great as well as the charming yet nasty and downright evil slave owner. But the pick of them was Sam Jackson who plays a pretty complex character as the head slave of Calvin Candie. Other than these there isn't much to like. It is, like most Tarantino movies, all style and no substance. It lacks the thematic depth of other great movies. He is a wonderfully talented guy. He uses dialogue wonderfully. Camera movements, blocking and staging are pretty great in his later movies. He obviously has everything it takes to make a thematically deep but fun movie but chooses not to. He has a trope and he has stuck on to it since the beginning and frankly it is wearing thin. Every one of his post Kill Bill movies glorifies violence. The sole intentions of him is to make cool movies and it is fine but it really frustrates me because he is better than this.
But there is one pretty complex thing he made. That is the relation between Stephen (S Jackson) and Calvin Candie. It is established that Stephen was in the house before Candie was born and he had raised him.

1189,23 September 2020,gautammayya,7," Filled with great scenes, must watch for a Tarantino fan","Quentin Tarantino's movie about slavery set in the mid 19th century caused quite an uproar at the time of release due to it being a genre movie. Several felt he wasn't taking the topic serious enough. Were they right? Yeah to an extent. Tarantino's favorite genre is the western/blaxploitation one and he continuously makes those kinds of movies. He loves revenge fantasies. So, he made this in those veins.
Basically, it is about a slave Django (Jamie Fox) who is freed from a previous owner by Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) who is a bounty hunter and he requires Django to find a couple of men who have a bounty on their head. Then they become friends and Schultz finds out that Django's wife is kept as a slave by Calvin Candie (Di Caprio) and they try to free her. It is a basic revenge story which has the usual Tarantino dialogue and violence. It is really bloody and there were moments where I couldn't watch it. The violence isn't the gritty serious type, but rather the fun one (Because it is fun, Janet!!!!).
I really enjoyed watching it. There were some really impressive set pieces and moments. The dialogue was sharp and quite funny. There were some quirky subtexts as well. The best part were the performances. Jamie Fox is great as he has the right mix of nastiness and naivety in him. Christoph Waltz plays a good guy version of Hans Landa and he is quite charming. He really has a wonderful screen presence. Di Caprio is great as well as the charming yet nasty and downright evil slave owner. But the pick of them was Sam Jackson who plays a pretty complex character as the head slave of Calvin Candie. Other than these there isn't much to like. It is, like most Tarantino movies, all style and no substance. It lacks the thematic depth of other great movies. He is a wonderfully talented guy. He uses dialogue wonderfully. Camera movements, blocking and staging are pretty great in his later movies. He obviously has everything it takes to make a thematically deep but fun movie but chooses not to. He has a trope and he has stuck on to it since the beginning and frankly it is wearing thin. Every one of his post Kill Bill movies glorifies violence. The sole intentions of him is to make cool movies and it is fine but it really frustrates me because he is better than this.
But there is one pretty complex thing he made. That is the relation between Stephen (S Jackson) and Calvin Candie. It is established that Stephen was in the house before Candie was born and he had raised him. The relation is portrayed as a usual slave owner one in font of others but behind, Stephen is shown to have dominance over Candie. It was a rather interesting concept but didn't really take off.

Sadly Django never came close and left me comparing it to Death Proof (not his best work either). Firstly this film was sooooo long it made my bottom ache. There seemed a lot of pointless scenes that really were unnecessary to push the story line forward. Also, Christphe Waltz was absolutely awesome in Inglorious Basterds but seem to reprise the role in Django ( in a round about way). It wasn't all bad. There were points in the film that I enjoyed but they were few and far between. Perhaps I was missing something and it may be that it requires a second viewing but my initial thoughts were disappointing and could have been a lot shorter to get to the final pay off. One final thought is this; if the need for pointless scenes were needed then perhaps it would have been better to include the back story of the Zoe Bell character.....",

1199,25 December 2012,Kgriffiths83,10, Different but still distinctly Tarantino.,This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. Quentin Taratino is a master at filmmaking. Django Unchained stars Jamie Fox as the lead role who sets out with the bounty hunter played by Christopher Waltz to buy his wife back from a slave owner. Before that takes place Waltz and Foxx team up as bounty hunters by killing a few people and getting paid while doing. Waltz makes a deal with Foxx that if he helps him with the bounties he will assist with the purchase of his wife. The film itself actually has parts that will make you laugh. It is a pretty violent film and for some the gore may be a little over the top. A bit of a warning..if you are offended by the N-word you might want to avoid this movie. It is used a bunch but one must realize the era for which it was filmed in. I am a black male and I wasn't offended one bit and even laughed a few times because most of the characters used it. From Jamie Foxx to Leonardo DiCaprio. Samuel Jackson has a pretty memorable role in the film and is sure to get a few laughs out of you. Brilliant acting from everyone involved. Christopher Waltz deserves an Oscar for his supporting role. I believe he has already won the Golden Globe for His part. The film is 15 minutes shy of 3 hours but never bores one bit. Some of the music may throw some people off because how modern the music is but it fits the scenes it was being used for. As with all his films Taratino makes a guest appearance in the movie towards the end. Watch it and enjoy this film,

From that point of view we see another successful movie with its Dr. King Schultz, Calvin Candie, Django Freeman and the first two eye catcher shooting scenes which show us the real Dr. King Schultz. However there are some negative comments to make without being 'nit-picking': It is not his 'crusade to ennoble violence' or some zooming, which has become his signature dish that I would like to criticize. It is rather the attempt to draw out the length of the movie -or script- with the help of multiple peek points to show more of the violence, more of cliché Hollywood conversations and drama and commercial music so that the audience achieves multiple orgasms. Unlike 'There were will blood' (2007), which is another 160 minutes-film, 'Django' didn't have anything more to say after 130th minute.

1220,31 January 2013,db748,9, Not bad at all,"Django Unchained, directed by Quentin Tarantino, is a story of a free slave transforming to a bounty hunter. Django, played by Jamie Foxx, and bounty hunter friend, Dr. Schultz, played by Christoph Waltz, go on a mission to free his wife, Broomhilda. A mix of comedy, action, and a history lesson make this a great movie which is supported by an all star cast. I believe that with the help of incredible acting, from the likes of Christoph Waltz, Jamie Foxx, and Leonardo DiCaprio, Django Unchained is the most profane, yet informative movies of the century.
The movie Django Unchained is full of profanity, incest, and nudity. The n word alone is said at least once every minute, as everyone uses the n word being that the setting of the movie was a different time. When reaching Candie Land, we figure out that Calvin Candie's wife is actually his sister. This is because of the movies southern incest roots as Candie Land is based in New Orleans. Incest was never right I believe, but the inclusion of this topic was genius by Tarantino as it gives the watchers a basis of the setting. Candie, one of the biggest plantation owners in the Django Unchained universe, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio. There are also multiple instances in this movie where there is nudity. The viewer cannot see any profane body parts, Tarantino directed the actors to cover up in the movie to a certain degree, but the inclusion of nudity portrays how harshly slaves were treated in the south. One scene illustrates what slave owners did to their slaves when they tried to run away; Candie put Broomhilda in a hot metal casket shaped box outside as she laid there naked. The viewer can see the fear in Hildi's eyes as the white men pull her out of her metal box. The movie was not only full profanity, but there were also multiple instances where the violence in this movie may be too much for the faint hearted.
Django Unchained is so violent that from the violence alone, it could be rated R. A scene I want to highlight as violent comes from the beginning of the movie when Dr. King Schultz frees Django. Dr. Schultz was on a mission to find Django and get his help for a hunt on three brothers with a big bounty on their heads. But first, Dr. Schultz encountered a couple of white men who were transporting the slaves including Django. He first encountered them nicely, but when the white men did not want to comply with his terms, he shot and killed one and let the other bleed out. Christoph Waltz portrays the character of Dr. Schultz perfectly at this moment as he is nonchalant about killing these men as if he kills for a living. This sets up the story of Schultz being a bounty hunter and is a perfect transition into the story of Django and Dr. King. Another scene I would like to shine light upon is when Django is at Candie Land. We are introduced to the idea of Mandingo fighting. We see that a Mandingo fighter is trying to run away from Candie Land saying that he can not fight no more. Candie then sends the dogs at him and the dogs tear him into shreds and eat him. Although Mandingo fighters were a fictional idea conjured up for the movie specifically, this scene shows how hard it was for slaves creating a kill or be killed atmosphere for African Americans in the south. The violence in this movie is necessary to show all people of color how far we have come in America.
Although the profanity and violence may be too harsh for viewers, Django Unchained portrays a message about how poorly African American slaves were treated at this time period. I believe that the main message of the movie is to show the adversity that slaves went through and that there were very few white men at this point who believed what they were doing as inhuman. In this movie, Tarantino portrays his message very well. Also, Schultz is like a father figure to Django as he frees him and trains him to be a killer. As the saying goes, ""money is power,"" and being a bounty hunter, killing fugitives was a very good occupation at the time. Schultz is like the police as he justifies the wrong doing of the evil. A second message Tarantino is trying to tell us is that love is a powerful thing. The whole plot of the movie is centered around Django's motivation to do whatever it takes to get his wife Hildi back and freed from slavery.
Overall, Django Unchained was a movie that exposed the viewer to the problems of slaves. To this day, it is sad to think that not much has changed as many African Americans are still being racially profiled and being killed by racists. Django Unchained shows viewers the faults that we had in our America and reminds us to never do this once again to minorities today.",

1222,27 November 2022,gwms321,1, Ridiculoua,"The man that brought you Pulp Fiction and Inglourious Basterds has struck gold once more with his near 3 hour work of art, Django Unchained. Django Unchained includes incredible performances from some of Tarantino's favorite actors like Jamie Foxx, Samuel L. Jackson, and Christoph Waltz. Tarantino keeps his signature long running time in Django, but trust me, you won't want it to be any shorter.
The film begins in the deep south, two years before the civil war. The movie simply prints this information in the opening scene, but not because the film is lazy, but rather because the setting is so vital to the story, it needs to be emphasized and obvious. In the opening scenes of the film we meet the two main characters; Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), a skilled bounty hunter who uses his old career as a cover, and Django (Jamie Foxx), a rebellious, strong-willed slave with an unending desire to reunite with his lost wife. Dr. King Schultz approaches Django, who is heavily chained with a few other slaves, and uses some persuasive actions to get Django's old owners to sell Django to him, and thus their journey of vengeance, wealth, and unrelenting human spirit begins.
As the film is set in a time of immense racial divide, it easily works to serve as a mirror for America and what it used to stand for. The harsh, emotion evoking dialogue is felt right from the beginning of the film, as the n-word is used by white people in a shockingly common way. Tarantino uses this language to not only make it impossible for the viewer to forget they are in the 1850s, but also to make a statement about race, and how truly despicable some people were back in this era.
There is a point in the movie where some will likely think Tarantino went too far to show this racism, but I believe it was a perfectly crafted sequence that made the viewer feel the slaves' pain, as well as showcase character development in Dr. King Schultz. In this troubling scene, two of Calvin Candie's (Leonardo Dicaprio) are brutally fighting to the death with their bare hands. It is an extremely graphic and eye opening scene that will likely stir up controversy, as to whether or not it needed to be in the film. During the fight, the camera pans to Dr. King Schultz and he is pictured actually wincing for the two men that are being forced to fight. While this may seem like a normal reaction, it is actual out of the norm for those in the room, as everyone else who is watching, especially Calvin Candie, is somehow disgustingly into it, treating it like a normal sporting event. In the moment that he winces, we see how some people of that time knew how wrong slavery was. Dr. King Schultz is a man who had become completely callous to blowing someone's head off at point blank range, but here we see him deeply troubled by the unjust way slaves are treated. As tough to watch as the scene was, it served an important role in developing the movie's characters, as well as its worldly themes.
The dynamic that Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz created onstage is also something that needs to be praised. Christoph Waltz's character serves as somewhat of a father figure to a Jamie Foxx that is able to develop from a helpless slave to strong, independent, gun-slinging bounty hunter. Their journey is the main event of the movie and they nail it. Of course they receive some help later in the film from Decaprio, and the way he becomes completely immersed in the role of a ruthless plantation owner; which is seen best during the dinner scene and fighting scene toward the end of the film.
Django Unchained stands very well as another Tarantino classic. While it does great as a bloody old western film, it also brings the viewer through a sophisticated emotional journey pairing themes of remembering this horrible mistreatment of a race with men who showcase the undying and unrelenting nature humans have and will always have through the ages.",

I thought it would difficult for Tarantino to overcome his puerile tendencies. So along comes Django and it takes five big steps back. No sense of truth, outrageous, crazy, entertaining for sure, but without that needed element of reality to support the audience's entry into a believable world. Without that assurance, we just are watching a stupid though interesting three-hour mess. There is no meaning in this movie, and though it tries to suggest it, it's merely the excuse to show us what the director really cares about. You can guess what that is.

Great soundtrack - so much so that during certain parts of the film I increased my volume so I could listen to the songs! Such an eclectic mix of songs which fit the film perfectly! 2. Fantastic cast - Christoph Waltz (amazing!) Leonardo Dicaprio (well we all know he is superb) and Samuel L Jackson really bought Daniel to life! But I must say (having never watched a film with him in before) Jamie Fox really surprised me. I didn't know what to expect from him, had only seen/heard him on the 'Gold Digger' song (which annoyed the hell out of me, maybe I avoided him on purpose) but as Django he was fantastic. Am certainly going to have to get my hands on more of his films! 3. Gore! Yes it has gore and for us gore fans it is sufficient enough to make us feel satisfied that we haven't been ripped off. It is what we have come to know from the master that is Mr Tarantino!! It is an engaging film, interesting and keeps your attention throughout.",

Jamie Foxx delivers his best performance and I credit him and Tarantino for a such a great role. I think such a conceptual film really brought out the amazing actor that Foxx really is. Even Kerry Washington's role was not a small one, because her purpose in the film with limited speaking roles really captured the viewer. Her role was so important to the character of Django that there has to be a great female actress to take on the real and she was perfect for it. The accents of comedy throughout the film in a sense relieved a small amount of the tension that was developed from the portrayal of blacks, whites, slaves, and masters in the early south. I think the grit and brutality of the film gave the film so much more life and Tarantino was definitely the guy to put that together and I commend him for it. Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson were great and very convincing in their roles making them either very unlikable or vice-versa. Personally, I feel that Samuel L. Jackson in front of the camera and Tarantino behind it is a combination of greatness because together they make great films. As a viewer you are generally drawn in to the journey that is embarked on and invested in the goal that Django is trying to achieve. Two Thumbs Up!",

For sake of catching an outlaw gang and saving a slave wife almost a hundred people have been killed. Killing people is like drinking water. Then we surprise hearing in press how possibly could a child obtain a gun, raid school and kill everyone and his brother. If you search for slightest humanity, you will return empty-handed. This Quentin Tarantino is crazy man. He always tries to surprise audience. He always suddenly kills my favorite character Vincent in Pulp Fiction and Dr. Schultz in here. I thought Dr. Schultz also was gonna meet happy ending but he got himself killed for nothing. A wise and smart man should not done such a stupid and silly move. He said: ""I am sorry! I couldn't resist"". Who knows maybe he is sick. Finally it is hard for me to understand which motives lie beneath to kill so much people. At the end of movie our charismatic negro saved his wife and they rode on towards mysterious future leaving back hundred dead. Maybe they even dare to hope to be happy.

1248,28 January 2013,dale-361-741533,8," Good watch, Christoph Waltz made the film.","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. There were some issues I had with the score and soundtrack, but other than that I liked it. It might be the first Tarintino movie I've seen that was told in a strictly linear fashion, which was surprising. I fully expected pulp fiction-esque jumping around on the plot line but this stayed as true to an old fashioned western story telling style. Foxx's character was great. I think Christopher Schultz really stole the show, though. His way of killing people with a grin really solidified him as a bounty hunter. Some of the Kill Bill style sound effects were annoying though, I think they didn't really add anything to the theater experience. I wish they would have come up with an original, identifiable score so that once this plays on cable in a few years, you wouldn't be able to mistake the music. Some of the scenes where actual songs were used, especially the hip hop song lost me. I prefer the music to match the time period for the most part. I though Leo's character was OK, not great. His terrible southern accent came off as campy. I expected more mandango fighting scenes, at least one bout style fight would have been cool. Watching the guys wrestle around on the parlor floor was underwhelming to me. If they would have done it in a tobacco drying barn or something with a cast of other mandango fighters and owners I think it would have been more believable. I liked Stephen, Samuel Lee Jone's character but he didn't get enough screen time. Some parts of the movie were really slow. The mask scene was hilarious and clever but went on about 2 minutes too long. Doesn't sound like much but once the joke is over, stop beating that dead horse! The cinematography left something to be desired. Some of the scenes could have been much more interesting if we cut out some of the close ups, stood back and really showed the grandness of the pre-war south. The place looks run down and the war hasn't even happened yet. Anyway the dialogue was pretty good, I didn't really hear any liners that are useful like tarintino's other films but I've also only seen it once so there might be some that stick with me after I see it next time. Overall, not a bad way to spend $8 but not on the same level as reservoir dogs or pulp fiction.",

1250,13 February 2014,robertpraduga,8, Cool Western Film,"Tarantino is the kind of director who can take on any genre in the world and make an award winning film out of it. Though a western film, Django isn't a cowboy hero, rather a free slave anti-hero. He's neither good nor bad, but is a steadfast individual who ends up learning a whole lot from the German bounty hunter who freed him. The only thing he wants back is his beloved wife, but ends up facing brutal violence, harsh negotiating, and formidable plantation owners. The fiery revenge in Django's attitude throughout the film gives the feeling that he might explode at any given second, yet he somehow fastens it to a leash. He is an attentive, patient, yet zealous man slowly making his way from the bottom to the top. The use of wide angle filming in this movie captures every bit of vivid landscape imaginable in 19th century Texas, giving the viewers a deeper appreciation for Tarantino's masterful filming in which he habitually displays. Really can't say much more than this. Just watch it now.",

It has the violence of Kill Bill, the interest of Pulp Fiction, and the thrill of Reservoir Dogs. In Django, Jaime Foxx absolutely kills it as the main character. I wasn't sure if he would do good, but when I saw it there was no doubt that nobody else could play him better. The supporting cast was amazing. If Christoph Waltz doesn't win an award as Dr. King Shultz then I will be angry. Also, Dicaprio is without a doubt the villain in this movie. I would have never seen Leo in this role after watching Titanic. Samuel L. Jackson is a prick in the film as well, but he provides comic relief that nobody else could have pulled off.

I really wanted to like it by any means necessary. And for a while, the film stood up to the hype. At least up until they finally get Django's wife and then Schultz shoots DiCaprio and stands like an idiot. From there the story, and the rest of the film altogether, lose meaning & value. I liked everything before that point, though. It was very stylistic, it was humorously violent and dark, and I actually payed attention to everything the characters were saying. Once they traded for Broomhilda, the movie should've ended. It should have only been a few minutes after that point to wrap up the film. I talked to a lot of people about Django after I saw it, and one of my friends made a sound observation that the last third of the film was more under the control of Jamie Foxx than Tarantino, and the quality dragged because of it. It was slower paced and had less clever dialogue. A lot of reviewers here have already made their observations about how unrealistic the ending was, so I'll leave it alone. I have a similar dilemma with 'Gladiator' in that I despise the first half-hour of it, much like I can't stand the last third of Django, so I never watch the whole thing. Still, I like when Tarantino actually lead production and I absolutely love DiCaprio's character. If you haven't seen it yet, I would definitely recommend it, but stop watching once Schultz & DiCaprio die.",

Some scenes looked and felt funny because of their unrealistic personification. But the scenes were well synchronized and placed.

Early in his career he was accused of outright theft of entire scenes from many of his cherished genre films, but as his art has progressed he has more deftly and subtly appropriated his curious sources into his own work. In Django Unchained Quentin is entirely in command of his inspirations as even his most blatant nods to other Western (or Southern) films are now so thoroughly re-imagined and re-crafted into his own vision that he's no longer guilty of any such petty crimes. No, his cinematic action is now all entirely his own. But in spite of the genuine draw dropping creativity on display throughout the entire film, there's still something seriously wrong.

I had heard name of this movie before but still I couldn't gather up courage to watch this movie since I am not a big fan of these movie types which are set in 1800s and with all cowboy characters. But anyhow with one of my friend's insistence I happened to watch it and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The movie is definitely long and you know it very well while watching the movie but anyhow you don't feel its length much. Since it has a very good story line and its basically a love story which makes it more interesting with all action and blood splattering scenes. I still don't understand how violently people are killed in Quentin Tarnatino's movies only and you don't find such blood splattering in any other movies when a person is shot. But again the overall experience was nice and I had a good time watching this movie which I would say is a classic from Tarantino. Background score is good and adds up to the flavor of the movie. Watch this movie and experience the times of 1800s in America which I understand was not really good for black folks.,

This film is full of dark humor, which is a staple in any Tarantino film. I was extremely proud of Jamie Foxx's portrayal of the lead character. Django is a man with a purpose. He has something to live for and something he's even willing to die for if necessary. That is what a hero is about. Rounding out a tremendously talented cast are also Kerry Washington, who portrays a damsel in distress, if you will, which is very different from other characters that we have seen her portray. An obvious favorite of Tarantino's, Samuel L. Jackson is cast to play a very controversial character and Leonardo DiCaprio is the necessary evil to Django's hero. If you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino, you will love the cleverly, well written ideologue, action and thought provoking imagery in Django that has become expected of a Tarantino movie.

And Django Unchained is a damn near masterpiece. The, actors and their performance, the camera work, the plot; all nearly immaculate. I enjoy the over the top nature of Tarantino's work, like the gushing blood or the character of Stephen. Furthermore the realistic dialogue, in general how people converse in this movie is a real treat. And the score for the movie is extremely catchy. The only two minor complaints about the movie are a.) in the first half of the movie, Django and Dr. Schultz ride through a city and people turn their heads at the sight of them but that completely disappears after that and any other city scene avoids that scenario entirely, which seems unrealistic and b.) how neatly Django was able to set up the wire for the dynamite. It is placed quite elaborate and I doubt that he had the time to install the wire that way since the remaining people of Candyland were already on the premises and the reunion with broom Hilda was already at dawn so the time table seems to be cut short for a quite professional installation. But other than that the movie is, as I already said, highly enjoyable. Tarantino doesn't rely on basic tropes or telling a story in order to push some narrative about morality or doing the right thing. And although the story is about revenge and doing what's right and also has a few clichés, the movie doesn't have that at its core. The movie isn't trying to be about that. It's a movie that simply tells a moving story about people fighting for each other. It's not here to remind people that slavery is a bad thing or that being an evil person is a big no no, it simply tells a story with some realistic and relatable characters that are very much human. And I can respect that heavily.",

Another masterpiece by Tarantino (Inglorious Bastards). But personally i m going to give all credit to the actors here, who made a simply fantastic story look more adventurous and dramatic. Christopher Waltz, playing a bounty hunter certainly deserves academy award nomination for his supporting role. Jammie fox was v good too bt not an award winning performance, but best of all, LEONARDO DICAPRIO, what a harsh, rich, bitter hearted, middle aged man hes played!! He actually deserves to win an Oscar for his supporting role. but it shocks me that he didn't even get a nomination in Oscars!!! He is the one who plays this character which makes the climax of the movie look better and stick you to ur seats while watching... Waltz was great through out the movie but Leonardo comes in and makes it way better and ""Western"" Over all, one of the best i have seen in years. Best of Dicaprio since Shutter island...A Must Watch!!",
1293,11 January 2013,ibadu92,9, Its Django....With a 'D',"Tarantino has done it once again. Django Unchained brings an equal amount of action, drama, and comedy to fit a wide variety of audiences. The story somehow keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire 2.5 hour period. Whether it be the extremely exaggerated blood effects or Tarantino's explosive cameo (literally), this movie will solidify itself as Tarantino's greatest. The story is no Pulp Fiction, but the acting is. Christopher Wirz keeps climbing the Hollywood ladder, slowly solidifying himself in the business and all other Tarantino films. Jamie Foxx was absolutely brilliant as Django, bringing a ""badass"" persona as well as a taste for the excitement. DeCaprio nailed it as well, his acting for an evil plantation owner was quite fitting, and there is one particular scene in the movie that strikes fear in the entire audience. Perhaps the most memorable acting was Samuuel L. Jackson, who plays DeCaprio's loud-mouth loyal servant. He manages to be mostly comical but also acts as an evil schemer. The most underrated part of the movie is most definitely the cameos. I am still confused on why James Remar played two different characters; possible Tarantino's way of fu**ing with the audience? Who knows, but other cameos such as Jonah Hill's was absolutely hilarious, I don't want to ruin it. Do yourself a favor and take a visit to the theaters during these fine holidays to witness true acting and directing.",

1297,12 April 2013,skypilot-3,1, What Was I Thinking?,"Django Unchained was enjoyable for the first hour, but became progressively unwieldy and winding as it progressed. The usual Tarantinoisms were evident throughout the film - i.e., bold imagery but exaggerated self-indulgent scenes and dialogue, copious blood splattering gore, scene jumping with visible seams, and ridicule that often leans on the side of being trivializing. But of all his films I've seen, this film provided a more appropriate forum for some of his tendencies that are usually inappropriate. For example, this is the one time that his unnecessary and insulting overuse of the N-word had a context for which it made at least some sense, even though it was still featured much more than necessary. It would have given the film more credibility if more research was done for an accurate depiction of facts (e.g. Nefertiti's image paired with the name Cleopatra).",

I could make this a long review, but I will keep it short and simple because I just can't find many words to perfectly describe this movie............AMAZING. From Tarantino's great writing, to the characters emotion and humor, getting us to laugh at stuff that we would not normally laugh at, in public anyway, and the characters way to really grip you and suck you in, really feel what they are feeling.

Leonardo DeCaprio plays a villain with glee. It was well acted and believable. It was a fairly good story, I like to watch a film that strays from the average and predictable, especially in westerns.

The stellar cast what was put together, was perfect, but would have been great to have seen Will Smith as Django. Again i think this was Jamie Foxx's best performance since Ray.

He is one of the few modern film makers who clearly works hard at delivering qualitative and unique ideas to mainstream audiences. The film does not disappoint movie goers looking for classic Tarrantino elements either. Django Unchained is filled with well-developed, strong leading characters, awesome musical cues, a few surprising cameos (Don Johnson), lengthy and intense dialogue, gratuitous violence (pushing the point of ridiculous) and of course, an epic grand finale.",
1314,7 September 2014,amsby17,7, Master Storyteller Tarrantino at it Again,"I really don't see how anyone could be a fan, but some people love it. I personally hated it. The glorification of violence, which really seems to be the only card up Tarantino's sleeve, was incredibly unnecessary. The ketchup blood squirts were reminiscent of any below average, D grade, slasher film of your choice. Even more troubling are the blatantly reinforced stereotypes. In spite of that, I was still hanging onto this ridiculously long melodrama because of the dynamic relationship between Django and the doctor. However, that too was ruined by horrible script writing. I wish I could say I didn't see it coming, but it was incredibly transparent. I am curious though, how can one be so betraying to ones own character within the span of an hour or so? In one breath the doctor is a man of wisdom and restraint; he knows the limits of his work. Yet, towards the end, he throws it all away citing that he just couldn't help himself. What a waste of a good character. All in all, I would not recommend, nor would I sit through this painful flick again.",

Leonardo plays a sublime role i must also add, although he has a much shorter involvement compared to the aforementioned persons, all in all i think Django Unchained is undoubtedly 'up there' for film of the year and should be a definite addition to all movie collections. 10/10",

Set in the Old South , the story follows a slave Django who was given freedom and the opportunity to trace down his lost wife. The story touches upon a topic which many Hollywood film makers would find uncomfortable to show. But many details were paid to with great attention . But what really defined this movie from the other action flicks in the industry was the purely the story and the characters that defined it. Characters played by Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz were very pure and impactive . But the character who has a permanent place in our hearts and minds would be ""Monsieur Candie"" . Bringing Hollywood Golden boy Leonardo Di Caprio to portray the villain is what captured many moviegoers . The antagonists in this movie were some of the finest ones we have seen in the past few years . Samuel L Jackson's character of a house slave is much deeper and his motives are more than meets the eye. Unlike other slaves, Stephen( Jackson) enjoys being oppressed . His title of house slave is the highest rank amongst slaves and he enjoys his advantage in the hierarchy . Messing up the ranks would make him like any other slave . He enjoyed being treated special. Overall, the movie was highly enjoyable and very ""detailed"". Unlike the previous movies of over the top gore(classic Tarantino) this movie did not have excessive blood.

Some people would argue that Tarantino had gone wrong with his last outing ""Inglourious Basterds"". But whether one liked that film or not, it does not matter, as the most important thing was that Tarantino found Christoph Waltz. Mr Waltz succeeds extraordinarily in Django Unchained too, and some would say he steals most of the scenes he is in. In addition to fine performance by this fine actor, we are served to solid performances by Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio too. Jamie's role is on parts a bit laid back and ""cool"" but we can sense his focus in his eyes. Leo obviously enjoys working with Tarantino and like many actors, really overplays (in a good way) when he gets into the role and spits out the well written dialog from QT. Directing is as good Tarantino as we've ever had, I'd probably most compare this to Kill Bill vol 2. There is blood but it is cartoonish and actually the most violent parts of the movie are couple of scenes portraying more emotional violence.

1329,2 April 2013,l_fc_gerrard,10, Django unchained is probably the best movie I've ever seen!,"WITH five Golden Globe nominations and two wins (supporting actor and screenplay), Quentin Tarantino's latest offering really packs a punch. Set in 1858, Django Unchained tells the story of a former dentist turned bounty hunter, Dr King Schultz (Golden Globe winner Christoph Waltz), helping newly freed slave Django Freeman (Jamie Foxx) to save his slave wife from one of the biggest plantation owners in the deep south of America. With the exception of 3:10 to Yuma (2007), I would rather watch paint dry than watch a Western, but Django Unchained is just plain exciting from start to finish. When I'm dragged to the movies to watch the latest Jennifer Aniston rom-com, I would expect to be bored senseless, but when it comes to Tarantino, audiences will want florid language, good storytelling, outstanding acting and a whole bunch of gore, and my oh my, does it deliver. The film has all the normal Tarantino personality, with long one-to-one scenes and well crafted dialogue, interesting characters and bad-ass monologues. Each actor plays his role to perfection — Foxx as the newly freed slave, Waltz as the quirky yet malicious bounty hunter, the beautiful Kerry Washington as the lost lover, Leonardo DiCaprio as a powerful young plantation owner, and Samuel L. Jackson as the trusty house slave. The film is a departure from Tarantino's usual form of disjointed storytelling — most notably Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction — and smooth flowing with a clear beginning, middle and ending. The last 20 minutes of the film tended to drag, but that's just Tarantino. Fans will appreciate the typical Tarantino shlock, but for newer audiences, it also a story that everybody can appreciate. It is a serious movie with a good take on slavery in the 1800s and some heart-wrenching scenes, but Tarantino also offers a lot of comic relief, both in the witty dialogue and situational comedy. Django Unchained is not up to the standard of his 1990s best, but if you want a solid narrative with good action, this one is for you.",

There's a nice turn from Di Caprio playing the nasty plantation owner Calvin Candy, and Jamie Foxx is great as Django. The film of course being a Tarantino film it is full of violence and not just in the sense of blood; this is also where the dark undertones of the film comes into play (which is quite well covered over by soundtracks and clever cinematography) the sense of violence towards the slaves and especially the whipping scene of Kerry Washington.

Its comedic/sad/action pack crazy mood springs you to be entertained the whole ride. It is a little long but you will be entertained and they go very into detail of the slave life. It is a good movie if you don't mind all the gore because there is quite the quantity of gore in it. But overall this movie was really funny, clever, smart, and sometimes sad in parts that will keep your eyes opened. This movie is for the majority of people because some found this too gory or too sad of a theme to be able to be comical. I thought the movie was fantastic and I didn't mind that it was almost 3 hours long because it was splendid. This is definitely a movie you do not wanna miss at all.

Every actor in this movie brings their best to the table, Jamie Foxx is the best I've seen him, he is a great main character to this film. Christoph Waltz is one of the best supporting characters I have ever seen, every time you see him you just want to hear what he has to say. Now the two main villains of this movie, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson, both of these actors are the best villains in a Tarantino movie I have seen. This film is a great western about a man on a quest to get his wife back and it keeps you entertained and interested from start to finish. The only time this movie ever falls off is the end is a little rushed but, still succeeds at being a very satisfying ending. This is Tarantino's best film since Pulp Fiction and I don't know how you can give a bigger compliment then that to a movie.",

There are also too many long drawn out shots that try to convey emotion but just make it more boring. But I will say that the Screenplay was good and the plot was extremely interesting.

But, I won't do that, I won't do it since it would simply not be fair to the magnificent piece of art Mr. Quentin brought again ( after Inglorious Basterds). He is a trademark, he is imaginably rich in vision and manages to deliver it and all the promises made to the viewer, implicitly. Now, I loved the Basterds and I have to admit that only after about 16 times of watching it , in 2 months, I might have gotten a slight sense of 'old', but hey... it could have been worse.

1351,18 August 2022,lcfernandesmachado,10, The best of the best,"First and foremost I am not going to sit here and talk about the film on any sort of in depth basis as I do not study film and have no grounds to base these opinions upon. I am, however, and always have been a avid movie goer and since my first Tarantino film I knew I absolutely loved his style and presentation. Personally, I thought Django Unchained was phenomenal. I think Tarantino did what he does best in this movie and that is entertain. The film provided a lot of everything, comedy, humor, action, violence, and romance. Personally I don't really know how you could dislike it with it covering all of those categories. Now, as to the criticism from people like Spike Lee and other members of the Black community, I simply am confused. History is an area I have grounds to speak on so I will. First of all, yes Spike Lee this is a movie that involves slavery and yes movies are meant for entertainment. Are people going to see the movie and being entertained by the simple IDEA of slavery? No. Does the movie happen to have slavery in it and also be entertaining? Yes. Correlation does not cause or imply causation Mr. Lee. Also to everyone else complaining about the use and depiction of slavery in the movie, don't watch it. You knew what you'd be in for, it's Tarantino for god's sake he isn't the most family friendly director. Also at the very least it is accurate to the time it is portraying which if anything, brings light to those who did not truly understand the brutality of slavery. And finally, I think some people have the facts wrong. Slavery, whilst being attributed and credited to America was not its birthplace. Slavery existed far before America was populated with white folk. And black people were not the only people enslaved, the only reason I believe that slavery is so closely tied to black people is because of the time it took place. When whites were slaves it was far further back in the past before Europe and such were developed. Africa was behind and considered a ""developing nation"". Also, white men were no t the first to enslave black people. Other black people were. During tribal wars in Africa the losing survivors were captured and kept as slaves. When the British came to Africa looking for workers, the slaves were the first thing the tribal leaders handed over and it escalated from there. Finally to some of the speculation over the ""KKK"" scene and its comedic values the KKK did no exist until AFTER the civil war as a way of ""keeping free black folk in line"". The people depicted in the film were called ""regulators"" and their primary purpose was to find and return run away slaves. That's the history lesson for today folks!",

Entertainment was from the start to the finish. Jamie Fox also earned my respect from this movie more. Christoph Waltz was as always great. Samuel L. Jackson surprised me a lot and also entertained. Kerry Washington work was just for minutes but was moving. Leonardo DiCaprio was so ruthless and unbearable at time. I became fan of Quentin Tarantino after kill bill and he has still not disappointed me or any other of his fans. His approach with reality with a twist of slight fiction is enjoyable at every part.

Like when he was in the bar with the bounty hunter all the people were surprised and anger that Djanjo was in the bar with them. All they wanted was that him dead. I was also very surprised when the KKK was in that one scene. Those members of the party went their so much just to see that one man killed. Really shows the rage and anger they have to blacks. I was also very startled at how the black butler treated all the other slaves including Djanjo. Very good movie that I would consider everyone to watch it. Language and violence is present.,
1362,5 January 2015,alanbraultcc16,8, The journey of a former slave freeing his wife and overcoming the struggles of being a black man in this era.,"Django is an exciting, thriller of an action-adventure. The over the top, unrealistic gore is typical of a Tarantino film yet doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the cinema. Jamie Foxx stands out in this movie embracing the role of a freed slave with a vengeance seeking to free his long lost wife. Christoph Walz also delivers with an astounding performance as a smooth talking quick witted German immigrant working as a bounty hunter who is against slavery. As can be expected, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers with a strong performance as a somewhat despicable slave owner who has one of the largest slave plantations in the country. The strong comaradery developed between Django and Dr. King Schultz along with small bits of humor help lighten the mood of a film that is about a very dark topic in the history of America. Overall, Django Unchained is an enjoyable movie for those looking for a civil war era western flick.",

In this very gory but highly descriptive slug-fest of a film, Christoph Waltz is a standout performer as a swift talking, clever, German bounty hunter. Displaying quick-on- his-feet thinking, Waltz embraces his role. His character displays the ideals of a man against slavery in his time period but still uses slavery to his own advantage. In this film, Christoph Waltz and his character, Dr. King Schultz captivated me and was by far my favorite character. My least favorite character was Stephen, the slave servant of a plantation owner Calvin Candie. Stephen is played by Samuel L Jackson. His character makes me very uncomfortable as he reminds me of that one friend who is all over you all the time and you want to say "" please stop talking to me"" but you can't because they tell you all the dirt on your other friends.

Not only are these people likable but they're incredibly real. Casting for DJANGO UNCHAINED was also very well done in my opinion. Christoph Waltz as Doc Schultz was simply brilliant and Jamie Foxx was spot on as Django - the delightfully detestable Calvin Candie, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, was pure icing on the cinematic cake! There are several fun surprises with actors in some of the smaller roles/cameos as well (like Don Johnson, Jonah Hill and Tarantino himself). Days afterwards I found myself thinking about this movie, not just the subject matter and what an embarrassing point in our history slavery was, but also about how smart and well written it was.

Sure, if you watch a Tarantino flick, you don't exactly expect a brilliant story per se, but rather want to see how it is told with over the top scenes and larger than life characters, and in this regard, the movie delivers. He gave the usual buddy-theme and ""damsel in distress""-theme an interesting twist with the whole slavery and bounty-hunting affair, but overall, it's nothing you haven't seen before. While Christoph Waltz does an outstanding job in portraying the German dentist-turned-bountyhunter Dr. King Schulz as a likable, prosaic and delightfully uninvolved anti-hero - after all, his job is killing people -, you can't help but feel he essentially just reprises his role from Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"", only as a ""good guy"" this time. There is nothing wrong with that, as it worked favourably both for Waltz and the movie itself, but innovative, this is not. DiCaprio, as well, is just deliciously unlikable as the movie's antagonist, and he's about the only refreshing part in it, as you rarely see him performing bad guys. Alas, I was a little disappointed in the role of Django. Not Foxx's performance, but the whole character seems shallow and you can't help but feel it could have been played equally well by any African-American actor. Not saying Foxx didn't give Django his own defining touches, but he just didn't have much to work with. In conclusion, the movie is a 9 out of 10. I substract one point for the usual Tarantinoism when it comes to violence. I know that it is his trademark, and I'm fine with the way he just completely overuses blood and gore during fire-fights, because there, it at least serves a purpose of enhancing the brutality of it, even though I don't like it. What I truly detest is when it's just there for shocks and shows, as it doesn't serve any other purpose other than being offensive (I'm referring to the eye-gouging scene during the Mandingo-fight) and disgusting, and for that, I have very little understanding. This and the reason that Tarantino himself hat a small cameo that was acted out plain HORRIBLE - seriously, if you can't do a southern accent, don't try to fake it - cost this movie a whole point, leaving it at a still good 8/10.",

But sometimes I tend to go against my own good judgment. And so I found myself watching a three hour trailer. The first half of the movie you see the unlikely couple of an eloquent German dentist turned bounty hunter and his liberated ex-slave partner killing plenty of supposedly bad guys. You have got to admire how they tracked all these people but you don't get any clue on how they did it. Were these crooks a bit careless on their facebook profiles? Did they track their cell phones? Oh wait, yes 1850. Facebook wasn't so popular than, so it must have been their cellphones.",
1385,1 April 2013,vdberg-stephan,3, Splitter splatter,"Maybe this is weird but this is the best Tarantino homage flick to date!!wittier dialogs than ever, superb casting (at last Samuel Jackson finally delivers a true haunting performance which reminds us that the uncle toms of this world are the true enemy..),super cool attitude, feel and storytelling that ferociously attacks conservatism, racism and prejudice. The only minus of the film is the minimal gun fighting climax which is stylishly built-up and much anticipated till then an the unjustifiable last quarter which only provides us with another interesting cameo from Parks and Quentin. A movie maybe poor in the making but rich in everything else, with both genuine respect for the craftsmanship of directing and audacious indifference to the new-gen directing methods craze...And what about the beautiful, yet again, track-listing of the O.S.T.?Both classical (richie havens, james brown, rocky roberts)and hipster at the same time incorporating true African-American modern music at a classic genre that sounded always either orchestral, or with folk/gospel songs!!",
1386,2 April 2015,diokokk21,10, The best homage to western ever made!!,"I viewed a trailer for Django around 3 months ago with vague interest and made a mental note to check it out, knowing that it would either sink or soar. It's tough to imagine Tarantino writing a better piece of fan fiction than that of his previous film, Inglorious Basterds, but he has now eclipsed that film along with Pulp Fiction with his newest work, Django: Unchained. Django is the ultimate story of retribution with an (anti)hero and motive the audience can all get behind. Jamie Foxx owns the role of a lifetime as the slave given freedom and the opportunity to exact his pain on the plantation owners ruling the south. Things get more complicated as the story progresses, but never so much that the audience becomes lost. That's not to say that Foxx steals the show, every actor is in full force for the entire film, and at no point is there a weak line thrown in. Django is an incredibly violent film, but this is to the film's credit as it exemplifies the horror of the slavery era and the terrible things those people had to go through. You will probably hate the villains just as much as Django by the film's midway point. But to no surprise, the most intense portions of the film are the long, drawn-out conversations conducted by Christopher Waltz's character (don't be surprised if he gains another Oscar this year, he's earned it). There is no other film I have seen in recent memory that deserves a ten star rating as much as this one. You don't have to love westerns to get into Django, you just have to love good films. Don't miss this one.",

Blood and violence are not missing either, it's not a film to watch with kids but hey.. after all this is a Tarantino film! I've never been a big Tarantino fan, although I generally think his films are good and original.

1392,9 March 2013,Cristina1481,9, MUST SEE! - Most enjoyable Tarantino film,"If Quentin Tarantino isn't the best screenwriter of the past 25 years, I don't know who is. This film brings him to two new places: (a) he has written a screenplay rivaling Casablanca in terms of unwasted syllables, and (b) he has found his muse, his Diane Keaton if you will, and that is Christoph Waltz. The film is certainly the best film I've seen this year, and as to its subjective ranking in the Tarantino filmography, well, I'd just be splitting hairs, but I'll put it up there as #1. The direction is sublime, the casting superb and inspired, the cinematography unmatched by anything I've seen recently (including Les Miserables), and although bound to be controversial in some circles, the story line spellbinding. No way that I could capture all the dialog; I will need to see this film over and over again, as I have done with the others, in order to fully capture its nuances. Suffice it to say that Waltz is even better than he was in Basterds, Foxx plays his role to perfection, and the supporting players, notably Don Johnson and Sam Jackson, are about as good as it gets (I will confess that it took me some time to realize that I was watching either.) Violent? Yes. Bloody? Very, but as my daughter is quick to point out, it's a paint-ball kind of bloody, so over the top that it goes well beyond gory-frightening into Toonville, and I mean that in the best way possible. There is so much to this movie, and so much deeper than one would think going in. Run, not walk, run to see it. Man, do I adore Christoph Waltz !",

He had some flashbacks about a slave being killed by dogs earlier in the movie (which was an order Calvin gave to his men), but that hardly justifies the shooting. What's worse - after he shoots Calvin instead of killing the guard as well he just stands there waiting to be killed.

The whole cast is solid, working perfectly with the breakneck speed of the film. ""Django Unchained"" really shined after a second viewing for those who still find issue with it. Even I was skeptical about a few parts the first time but I was glad I saw it again. While this does reach nowhere near the true horrors of slavery I appreciate that the film has not softened any aspect of the environment during the time. This is definitely one of the best movies EVER made and will never bore you for a single minute: trust me.

With just the right amount of action, and a great plot to keep the viewers entertained with.Now with Jamie Foxx he hasn't been my favorite actor but in this role he really shines.They couldn't have found a better person.The movie overall is among the best films i have seen in awhile with a great director and a dynamite cast that keeps the excitement going, and Dicaprio did pretty well as the southern bad guy.The movie is MUCH more than just another rescue mission its a action film that brings back the old western days with a hint of our present times.",

King Schultz or even Stephen, the narrative is nice and doesn't changes much from any other movie, it's all lineal except for some flashbacks we'll have about djangos life before the start of what we saw in the movie, its themes are great and how the movie shows us what they used to do with black skin people at those times.

1407,1 December 2021,valencape,8, GREAT!,"He has reason to believe one of the slaves might be of interest to him. He enters into negotiations to purchase Django, who he has reason to believe may help him in finding the Brittle brothers, for reasons involving the doctor's late wife. And already Tarantino has us, and it's off to the races. How odd that the path of the wagon and the slaves, which should have sailed past one another like two ships in the night, should meet head to head? He is a wizard from a fairy tale, a man capable of knowing about people's lives, steering their fates, seducing them into situations in which they receive the destinies they deserve. Although there is a great deal of the realistic in ""Django Unchained,"" including brutal violence, King Schultz is not real in the same way as the rest. A ""deus,"" for those few who may not, is a person or device in a story that appears from out of the blue and has a solution to offer. He refers to the conventions of Greek tragedy, where a crane was used to lower actors playing gods onto the stage"". Here is a plot that requires a lot of information, and does not have any time to lose in introducing it or searching for it. He also becomes the friend and partner of Django, gives him his freedom, and after a winter spent in using Django as his partner in bounty hunting, joins with him in trying to win back possession of Broomhilda , Django's wife. This is a brilliant entertainment, in which Tarantino takes on the subject of slavery as he did the Holocaust in his previous film, ""Inglourious Basterds"". To me, the most torturous thing in the world, and this counts for 'Reservoir Dogs' just as much as it does to 'Pulp,' is to watch it with an audience who does not know they are supposed to laugh. Because I am hearing the laughs in my mind, and there's this dead silence of crickets sounding in the audience, you know?"" I sorta know. It's a brutal fight, covered with the blood that flows unusually copiously in the film. The losing slave screams without stopping, and I reflected that throughout the film there is much more screaming in a violent scene than you usually hear. Finally the fight is over, and there's a shot of the defeated slave's head as a hammer is dropped on the floor next to it by Mr. At this point in the film I found myself mentally composing a letter to Quentin, explaining why I stopped watching his film. Do you remember Michael Madsen cutting off the cop's ear in ""Reservoir Dogs?"" When QT begins a movie, I believe, his destination is to aim over the top. At some point in the scene, QT's laughter may be because the audience expects to see violence but does not expect to get it a such an extreme; he's rubbing it in. Candie stages fights to the death with slaves called Mandingos, and Schultz says he wants to buy one of the fighters. That's clever misdirection with the mandingo as a cover story. This is such a flamboyant film that the most challenging performance in it, the one that rubs it in the most, actually runs the risk of being overlooked. He confronts Calvin with the obvious: It is Django who loves Broomhilde and desires her. Revealing this truth involves Stephen in a betrayal that in some respects is the most hateful action in the movie, because he sins not only against the others but against himself. Stephen is a crucial character because he forces African-American viewers to acknowledge the role some of their forebearers played at the time. Jackson's performance requires not only his gifts as an actor but his courage as a man who understands the utility of an obvious role and is willing to play it. The name ""von Shaft"" also reflects QT's wicked fondness for bringing distracting and outlandish names into the midst of dead-serious and violent material, as sort of a signal to the audience that Tarantino knows he's treading on the edge of parody. In this case, although the total comes to over 100, I understood it as a word in common daily use through the antebellum South. The film has also been attacked for its incredible level of violence, and that's what I was responding to in composing my imaginary letter to Tarantino. But it's not what a film does but how it does it, and in one sense the violence here reflects Tarantino's desire to break through audience's comfort level for exploitation films and insist, yes, this was a society and culture that was inhuman.",

Fans of Tarantino's work will definitely appreciate it. For those who aren't that familiar with his work, beware: violence, blood and galore in overloads. The soundtrack is perfectly chosen from the music Tarantino had at home: it definitely plays an important part in setting the atmosphere. The universe is sordid, the plot is worse, some scenes - two, to be precise- had me nearly throwing up. Despite that, I won't criticize the level of violence in the movie. I don't think it's unneeded. On the contrary, it is a very important part of that universe. Black people were killed and tortured; it should shock you. Sparing the viewer's sensibilities would also spare him the full extent of the horror implied. So no, it's not needlessly violent.

Concerning the Comparison that would be held between it and other movies of the Same year like TDKR, I believe that these are entirely different genres as different as their directors where Nolan is Focusing on the Plot & the Twist and is the new master of thrillers -IMO-, while Tarantino is the King of the Entertaining genre -If there is something to be named so :)- & also is one of the best ever writers. any way I believe that it is one of Tarantino 's best work ever , & it is highly recommended .",

1426,21 January 2013,andreas-holmquist,10," Finally a good representation of the ""white man""","With any Quentin Tarantino film the expectation is always going to be at its highest. So what starts off as a new good looking film from QT turns into more of an event. Django really did live up to my expectations and I hope any other QT fan out there thought the same. When he first announced the release of Django Unchained, I thought okay another meaningless title, what is it going to bring and is it going to be as good as his previous films, is this is where it goes down hill for Quentin. Really I was just being pessimistic. Because yes it was just as intriguing as any other of his previous films. Quentin's love for cult cinema is commonly unknown by many, which was why I knew there was a western being loaded into the Quentin cannon anytime soon. He mentioned in one of his interviews that a big inspiration to him was Sergio Leone and his classic spaghetti western 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'. So to see Quentin tackle the ethics of the western genre made the release that much more of a double event. But strictly speaking Django isn't a western. If anything it should be tagged as a 'Southern' coming from the man himself. It has nothing to do with the western genre. Unlike Inglorious Bastards, Django doesn't try to be a riot and doesn't try to be as politically correct as possible (referring to WW2). It concentrates more on character development, pointing at Django (Jamie Foxx). For the first time in Quentin history the story is more linear and concentrates on the portrayal and the story of one character's journey. Also there are no shifts in time like Quentin's previous films. We don't see Travolta being shot by Willis and then reappearing in a later scene which is based before that scene. This doesn't leave you so confused but that doesn't mean you're not left confused at times during the film. After all that is QT job. Which is why as Quentin fans we need to see the film another two to three times to get the full QT experience. Also we don't get 'Chapter 2' or anything like that. Django goes for the more 'Rescue the princess' type theme. The story sees Django a slave being ""Unchained"" by a bounty hunter slash dentist Dr King Schultz (QT latest discovery Christoph Waltz) who won his deserved Oscar for Inglorious Bastards in 2009. However over the campfire he is amazed to know that Django is married to another slave called Broomhilda Von Shaft (Kerry Washington) even though Foxx and Washington played a couple in Ray. Now as this is a 'Rescue the princess' film, there is a villain. Django Unchained's finest element is the new Robert De Niro, AKA Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin Candie. A plantation owner in the south. Who keeps slaves including Django's love. QT tries to make him a perfect, spiteful, prone to flattery, selfish, vain man who wants nothing else but money. But the result is naive and funny which doesn't disappoint. Now me being negative. Quentin's attempt to include black comedy leaves the viewer slightly confused and doesn't want to know why they are confused either. I know there has been some controversy on the films running time and frankly it is not long ENOUGH. It flew by for me and I feel that some scenes could have been longer but I have a hunch they were shortened for the best. But other than that the only other advice is don't watch the trailer as it doesn't do the film justice! In conclusion Django Unchained is a delight to watch from two hours before the film starts to the end credits. Verdict: Another bloody, well scripted masterpiece that QT has fed to our hungry eyes. Django really does help define QT as one of the finest directors in modern day filming. The only issue now is, can he keep it up?",
