0,29 April 2019,MoistMovies,7, Not as good as infinity war..,"But its a pretty good film. A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could've been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...",/
1,6 May 2019,dschlatter,7, Success does not equal quality,"The soon-to-be most successful movie of all times actually ranks fairly low among its companions. I'd say it is about as good as Winter Soldier.
As a fan of the pevious films, expecially Infinity War, I couldn't miss this one. I think that goes for most movie-goers. After Infinity War, we HAD to see how it ends. Infinity War was an almost perfect movie.
And now we get less than perfect. Now, we get ""good"" or ""very good"" and in comparison it seems almost bad.
My issue is not how the film is made. But with the story they chose to tell:
1. Thanos can't be the stronger villain without his gauntlet. That's poor writing.
2. Captain Marvel and Captain America are NOT equally strong (when fighting Thanos).
3. Stormbreaker was this amazing weapon in Infinity War. It beat Thanos with all stones in his gauntlet. Now it's just as steong as the hammer.
4. Thor has just found his purpose and strength in Ragnarok and Infinity War. Now he is a joke.
5. The time travel is, well, how itz always is. Hardly logical.
Those are the issues that now trouble me after having seen it two days ago. It just wasn't as good as Infinity War. They missed their mark.",r

3,26 November 2021,davyjones-636363,10, Crazy in every sense,"This film is an emotional rollercoaster with some of the coolest superhero plot lines ever drawn up. It's straight up the most epic Marvel film that will probably ever be created. I don't see how Marvel could ever top this, but getting to see these characters all together at least one last time was a reward all on its own.",v

5,25 April 2019,ahmetkozan,10, The End of an Era!,"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.",e

9,9 May 2019,jke_up,7, A decent end of an era.,"Infinity war was overall a better movie, but this movie had the disadvantage of being the follow up to that movie.

12,6 May 2019,jtindahouse,4, Time travel is such a lazy way to write stories,Only a month or so back I was talking to a friend about how much I hate it when serious movies use time travel to get their characters out of problems. I have no problem with movies like 'Back to the Future' or 'Hot Tub Time Machine' that are both comedy based and use the time machine as a plot for the movie as opposed to a solution for characters problems. When a serious movie uses it though it as lazy as writing as dream sequence in my opinion.,0

14,24 April 2019,vert2712,9, The zenith of the MCU franchise.,"I feel like I'm wasting my time writing down my thoughts about Avengers: Endgame, because nothing I (or any critic) could say about it would ever dissuade a prospective viewer from seeing it. But after having had the chance to watch it at a preview screening, I can't help but say a few spoiler-free words.",2
15,12 May 2019,ravi2445,9, Very disappointing,"Right in the beginning, you know how the movie is going to end...the good guys are going to win. How anti-climactic that was.. The stage is not set right (half of all humanity is gone, but the enormity of that is not explored...)...when you have Thanos give his explanation as to why he did what he did, I found myself thinking - well, he actually has a point.
In the meanwhile, every single superhero is given time to fight, say some cute things, some say a few smart things, a few even manage to say profoundly philosophical statements...
The quantum physics explanations used to explain how things are done, are plainly non sense... ..they just made stuff up as they went on.
Alls well that ends well. Except we spent 3 hours to find that out.",9
16,2 March 2020,Leofwine_draca,9, Great climax!,"So here we have it, AVENGERS: ENDGAME, the expansive sequel to not only AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR but also to the whole last 13 years or so of Marvel cinema. It's a film that had big boots to fill but the good news is that it's a complete success and every bit as enjoyable as its predecessor. At three hours I wasn't sure about the pacing, but even during the slower first half the viewer's interest remains piqued thanks to the witty dialogue and huge cast of well-established characters doing their thing.",2
17,24 April 2019,rjcattermole,10, The best Marvel Superhero movie ever and also the epic conclusion to the 21 movies in the MCU,Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date. This is also the best and epic conclusion to the 21 movies in the first 10 years of the MCU. This is the epic culmination. The best storytelling ever told.,/

19,27 April 2019,nickgray-12862,7, Emotional but bit messy.,"So it all ends. I have loved most of the MCU, some have been too predictable but I awaited after IW to see how it would all pan out. Firstly some of my favourite characters are a joke. Please don't dumb Thor or Banner/Hulk down, not necessary. Great starting scene, then slow dramatic next 1.5 hours. It builds to the time travel reversing all section with too many plot holes. We've all seen other time reversing movies who have done it so much better. The last hour is spectacular, great to see all the gang back but it feels rushed. Emotion runs high and defo not a kids film in my eyes. Cap is great Stark is amazing but everyone else feels like there just there. What I loved was the beauty of the final scenes, wonderful score and saying goodbye to old friends. Overall wanted more, but even far from perfect is still pretty good.",r
20,26 April 2019,moneypennycharley,8, Avengers: Contradictiongame,"Personally I found it mediocre at best. Too many contradictions to count. So thors hammer DOES grant him the power of lightning? I know Odin tells thor that it doesn't give him those powers but only helps him channel them, so what, cap has had that ability the whole time but saved it or never knew till now? And what's with the whole changing the past doesnt change the future? How does anything they do then accomplish anything. And why does nebulas eye thing just conveniently decide to play the most incriminating thing possible, when it could play anything in reality. I'm glad at least that the 1 dimensional captain marvel was not present most of the film, that at least was a plus. And further more, why was tony seemingly un injured from the stones, yet died? Is he a god and we never knew? Half god quil was nearly turned to ash from just one in seconds, tony used them all. I just dont how they ended up deciding to go down some of these paths. It's like they never saw any of the past movies. And hulk?bruce? Beta Hulk? What ever he is, he managed to find a way to be more useless than in the last film. Seriously what did he even do other than the first fix snap? Why not let thor do it, I think he could take the power of it if he can handle the full force of a stars radiation in the vaccum of space. And then cap just stays in the past like an a hole and watched all this horrible stuff unfold? How did any of the events that led up to it happen then with out him? They never needed him at all? And if you cant change the past, then how does he stay and literally change the past by being in it? Too many self creating paradoxes that they basically tell you to screw yourself if you start asking ""wait but why....?"" All in all, I think what we experienced here is they peaked with infinity war, and cant make something as good. I mean cmon, thanos had the personality of a lobster in this film. It felt like we were dealing with an unknown enemy, yet we do know him.... and Gamora died in infinity war yet never comes back? Why? Because it was the soul stone thst she died for? Then arent you changing the past by removing that Gamora from the time line? And why is Thor like a broken sexual assault victim, hes the GOD of thunder for crying out loud. and why does Thanos' most impractical weapon ever, his double sided sword thing, just absolutely demolish cap's shield? Did Tony give him a fake lol? And we get to see Loki grab the tesseract and vanish, and we never see the follow up to that? What a loss of a good plot line, follow lokito find it and enlist his help against thanos. HOW DOESNT IT CHANGE ANYTHING?!?!?! Seriously it just seems like lazy writing on their end more than anything else. Like someone got half this plot and someone pointed out, hey changing the past changes the future you know, so they were like ahh crap that's right, well, just have beta hulk give some science nonsense spiel about it and that should clear things up. And if taking past gemora to the future to replace the one they lost works fine..... why doesnt anyone go grab the Tony from before he left to get the stones? If changing the past doesnt change the future, how does it stop him from sacrificing himself? Same goes for black widow. The final battle seen wasnt that great either, I like my fair share of female super heroes but just the whole girl squad assemble thing was a little too much, like they all conveniently ended up in the same place at the same time, cmon we all know you just wanted you PC plug, you guys are more creative than that, that was just desperate and laughable. I'm a big fan of marvel movies, and to be fair this one had the most to live up to, but I still feel like they didnt do it justice. Perhaps they shouldve taken more time between films. Oh well. If the spider man movie is no good as well, I think I'll be parting ways with marvel films.",e
21,14 June 2019,sajakram,7, These get worse!!!,I don't really know what all the hype is about. Bored watching this as it's the same again just rehashed. Glad to see the back of the Avengers to be honest.,f

23,27 April 2019,marcusnichols,10, Really Marvel??? Poor Poor Movie To End On!!,"I don't know where to start!!
Plot holes all the way through,
Two of the strongest Avengers might as well have not bothered! Thor and Hulk are rubbish in this movie. Danvers? Forget it. Saved tony smashed a ship, but Thanos can still throw her about?? So we travelled through the quantum realm, but had the time stone early..... why not use that? The Mjolnir and Caps Shield change of ownership just annoyed me. But my biggest Disappointment was how they didn't use Thor or Hulk. Hulk has been sold out massively in the MCU and it sucks. I could go on all day. The more I think about it, the less I like it. That's me done with Marvel now. RIP Stan Lee.",=

To what end. I guess I was hoping there would be one scene or at least one line that put a smile on my face or made me feel anything at all except extreme pain and boredom. There wasn't any of that unfortunately, so I just wasted three hours of my life I could have spent on basically anything else and it would have been more worth while. I can't decide which one was more painful to watch, this or Aquaman? Both equally and utterly disappointing I guess.",r

31,23 May 2019,dan-2199,7, Oh. My. Gosh! What a boring movie!,I had higher expectation from this movie but it turned out to be superheroes drama/comedy mixed with little action. There was very little action in the movie compare to past Avengers. 3d effects were not up to mark either. I was fairly disappointed by this one. If drama is your genre then go for it but if you like action then skip it.,
32,4 May 2019,Growfeather,3, Not for kids.,I went in with the highest expectations and came out underwhelmed and disappointed. its nowhere near as good as infinity war !!!,

35,26 April 2019,asassandroo,10, Best End of an era,"It was perfect i had so much fun while watching the movie it's been 3 hours but we didn't feel, every one in the cinema cried and laughed, and I liked how when tony stark is dead there wasn't a drama and his wife when she tells him (everything will be okay) and the sceine after tony stark died when he said ""i love 3000""
(EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT)",
36,20 May 2019,layanalshehriii,10, J,"Perhaps Infinity War was the film of Thanos in which he imposed what he was seeking, but Endgame is the movie of Avengers who impose what they seek, and perhaps his title, which translates to ""the end of the game"" means the end of what Thanos sought. But do you think that would be that easy? Contrary to what Thanos did quite easily? you are wrong! The Infinite War movie may have been very touching and shocking when Thanos killed half of the universe creatures, but the endgame is more impactful and shocking than him. Although the cuff will be in the interest of the Avengers in this movie, nothing comes for free, must be given to get, and perhaps the long time period for the movie that reached three hours was very reasonable because their journey to achieve their goal was neither easy nor many options in front of them.",
37,26 May 2020,auuwws,10, Great,"It's definitely not as strong an impression as it was on first viewing, which makes perfect sense, but I still think the film was extremely successful on multiple levels. One of the better things is that the three-hour film is not boring at any point, it seemed to me to last ""only"" two hours, which is not easy to achieve. I also look at this film as the finale or the last episode of a series you've been watching for years, which on the one hand is actually true. So much has happened before this film, so many characters and events. This film is just the crown of it all, one big rounded whole. It is obvious that the Russo brothers had a plan because it is obvious that they paid attention to details and some smaller moments that real fans will easily recognize. Of course I have some objections that are related to certain characters and some scenes, but given the type of film and how much the film offers, I can just get over it and forget about it. I think this Marvel project is unrepeatable and it's something we should appreciate no matter what you think of movies like this.",

42,30 April 2019,majoreasy,4, Good but a mess in the story department...,"I loved how the story of the Infinity War was conceived. With all the fight scenes and the emotional aspect of the movie, especially the end part, everything was superb. But this is supposed to be a wrap-up film. The directors and writers just destroyed it all. What's the point of doing a hype over Captain Marvel for this movie when you just give her a few minutes of screen time? It would be forgiven if you give her an amazing fight with the villain during the climax. But what have you done? With just a few kicks and punches and that's it. It doesn't give a scratch over Thano's face. What a crap!!!",

50,2 May 2019,P97,9, awe inspiring,My biggest problem with this movie... The time travel. It's such a cheap way to accomplish the furthering of the story. The events of infinity war became cheapened because everyone came back.,

You need special equipment and suits to time travel, but not the bad guys who follow? No one traveling through time ages except Captain America??? SO many dragged out scenes with 'on the nose' dialog. They only made it 3 hours long to give the impression it was 'epic' when it wasn't and isn't. Making Thor a laughing bafoon who gives up being king so he can continue being fat and lazy? If you can't kill your superheroes, turn them into rejects. They'll probably reboot all the characters like they did with Spiderman... again...and again...and again.",
52,13 May 2019,arclinecreative,3, Overrated and full of filler,"I think it was one of the worst superhero movies. In this film, they destroyed all the preparations made in the previous episode.
It was very good to use the idea of time travel and it could be much better.
The story of getting the stones was written without much thought. All stones were very comfortable. Changes that were ignored in time.

53,31 July 2019,hamed_tgh,8, terrible,"The 22-movie Infinity Saga of the MCU comes to a close in its best film yet. Avengers: Endgame is everything we wanted and more. It's hilarious, it's action-packed, and has one of the best scenes I've ever seen in a superhero film, let alone any movie. It's full of fan service and nods to the previous films. I don't really have any issues with the film, at least those that are not spoilers anyway. If I had one non-spoiler issue with the film it would be fact that the first hour is a bit slow but afterwards it picks up and never stops. Really any complaints I have with this film is shut out by everything else. My complaints are just nitpicks. It fits its three hour runtime very well and provides a highly satisfying end to the 11 year saga that began with Iron Man in 2008. The MCU has set a new direction and I can't wait to see what happens next.",
54,29 April 2019,cwt-73297,10, Amazing Final Film in the MCU's Infinity Saga (NO SPOILERS),Avengers INFINITY WAR was the best in the series so my expectations were low for the follow up. This movie dealt more with substance than style and is completely different than all the other Avenger movies. Definitely the most emotional movie of the series hence why they called it Endgame. Yes it's long but the characters carry the film much more than the action does. I enjoyed the film and may watch it again sometime. It was very good and delivered a fitting end but not the type of Avenger film you would want to watch again and again. That film belongs to INFINITY WAR.,

58,27 April 2019,SnoopyStyle,8, Back to the Future or not,"If you are going to do a two-part movie, you need to flesh out the second movie before you make the first one. Infinity Wars - why did Dr Strange give away his stone? - Endgame - I don't know. Infinity Wars - if to take the Soul Stone requires a soul, what happens when you return it? - Endgame - I don't know. Infinity Wars - if there was only one hope for victory, what was it? Endgame - I don't know. Dr Strange refuses to tell and obviously a few Avengers had a chance of taking and using the hand, even in Infinity. So is Dr Strange BS or what? Endgame has the biggest fight scene of the Marvel series but for the most part it was an all-in brawl. Dr Strange's group and Ebony Maw seemed to have a plan but no-one else did. To look real battle scenes do need to be choreographed.
So it's the end of an era and presumably the start of a new one. Afro-Americans did well. They have Black Panther, Cheadle stays on as War Machine (takes over the Ironman position?? )and Falcon becomes Captain America. Women fill a host of secondary positions but only Black Widow has been at the core of the Avengers and Captain Marvel was distanced from the Avengers (ie. underutilised) in Endgame. Black Widow went without any sign of a replacement so yep, we now have an all-male Avenger Squad. WTH?

61,25 January 2020,flowergirlindahe,6, Disappointing,As the title says. You know you have reached a dead end when you introduce time travel to resolve things. It works fine in shows that focus on it like Quantum Leap or Sliders but its usually a sign that you cant write worth a darn if you bring it into something else. That and alternate universes etc. They have been done to death and back and are just a plot device to overcome bad writing.,

This isn't serious entertainment and shouldn't be considered as such, and it reminds me of how George Lucas made Star Wars as an homage to the cheap serials like Flash Gordon.

A movie that has everything a fan will ever dream of, an amazing cast and a wonderful climax. It is such a huge payoff from 10 years worth of building up. To look at this from a Fan's perspective, it is an awesome movie and it is a masterpiece. But to look at this from a critic's perspective, it is not the best movie.

A perfect compliment to a two part epic. It was what I thought it was going to be, a lot of talk, a lot of planning, but amazingly it was not boring. Not for one second!
Infinity War was the moment we were all waiting for and then they tell us they are going to split it into two films. End Game could have gone south with this choice, but it did not. It's always exciting, especally if you are a comic book fan or have been watching these movies for now eleven years.
Don't want to say too much, but shine a light on Robert Downey Jr. who got to perfect his Iron Man persona to the point where Hugh Jackman can't even surpass him. Captain American is giving all us FanBoys everything we ever wanted to see and Thor...underperforms with hilarious results (and hopefully will create 2019's most popular costume for a certain type of man). Loved Mark Rufflo in this film and Thanos baby, still the baddest villain around.

This had some feel-good moments with massive collaboration from most of the entire universe. Also, this movie could possibly have elevated to an 8 if they put Deadpool in...that would have been awesome and hilarious. It was not overly thought-provoking.

There were some interesting moments, some funny moments that really made me smile, but at the end it all fell flat. Flat as a rug. They tried to cram each and everyone in the movie, but in my opinion it feels fake, like parading with fake cardboard masks. The CGI-fest soon became boring...except for the de-aging of Michael Douglas, that was 100% uncanny valley material. I was watching it feeling nothing, feeling dead inside.

The fact that the film manages to be THIS good more than makes up for its few flaws.

The only blemish on this otherwise perfect movie is Captian Marvel she is the most *obnoxious* characters I have ever seen in my entire life. Annoying, Stone cold, smug, unsimpathic, ridiculously overpowered when Thanos punches he she just takes it WHAT THE ACTUAL H**L. All the other characters can barely land a punch. She flies through Thanos' ship like it is cardboard. She is a very unnecessary charcater. What bugged me the most is that when all the other Avengers were depressed even poor Thor was trying to drink his troubles away. Then this sarcastic a**hole comes in completely insensitive to them. What is wrong with you! Horrible Horrible Charcater. It reminds me of the Spongebob episode *Artist Unknown*. Squidward was the art teacher.

119,30 April 2019,taz1004,6, Plot holes galore. Overrated.,"Amended after re-watching:
First the good:
1. Big fight scene was epic and was great to see everyone on screen at the same time . Amazing stuff.
2. Favorite part - Cap handles Thor's hammer. Just outstanding and emotional.
Ok, now the not so good:
1. Captain Marvel. Why they make the biggest and baddest superhero someone we haven't grown to love over the previous decade is baffling. And beyond that, Brie Larson is just unlikeable. But seriously, if she could take Thanos on head to head by herself and blow up his ship in seconds, why not let her wear the gauntlet? Lastly, going out of their way to let you know she's a lesbian was a bit much. You don't need a short haircut and ugly clothes just because you're gay. Plenty of attractive lesbians out there, but whatever. Brie butchers the role regardless.
2. Professor Hulk - did anyone like this adaptation? We've grown to love seeing Hulk smash and in both this and Infinity Wars, not one single fight scene with him smashing. Just sad.
3. Fat Thor - ok, fine, Chris Hemsworth can pull off the comedy really well, and I enjoy it when he does, but the whole movie we get the Big Lebowski? I would have much rather seen him back in shape magically from reconnecting with Mjolnir. In the end, he was still extremely awesome, so that was fine, but I just don't see the point of making him fat for the whole movie.
4. Time travel - is anyone besides me sick of every Sci-fi show using time travel to fix everything? If you're going to do it, at least take full advantage. We had the opportunity to see one on one fights with Thanos' Black Squad. How about Hulk going primal against the big guy (and even hurting Thanos some). Dr, Strange rematch with Ebony Maw, etc., etc. on the end, I think they could have cut some of the boring first hour and given us more action fight scenes that we've come to know Marvel for.",

In Infinity War, the war sequence n the fight scenes were all shot in broad daylight n that too in an open field of Wakanda without the fast paced camera tricks. It was visible who was fighting who but Endgame's war sequence is shot in the dark with too much fast paced camera tricks. At times it became hectic to make out who is fighting who.

Except nobody ever DIES in these movies (like the Red Skull-cough cough). They'll be brought back by some sort cloning technology or with some weird voodoo magic (...or time travel). It worked for Deadpool after all. The avengers literally couldn't go on any further. I mean the violence kind of escalated when they destroyed a city, then a small country, then a planet and finally the entire universe! You can't trump that! Although... Buffy the vampire slayer did save the multiverse. Was it just me or did Dr Strange gave the audience the literal finger towards the end? He did but this movie is PG13 so it wasn't that finger. Like everyone else who has a modicum of intelligence I too thought Thanos's motive was moronic as well as it was dumb. Try to follow my reasoning. He snaps his fingers and half the Universe's population is gone. What are the survivors going to do? Hmmm? The most logical thing is they will just breed again and then we're back to square one. We can't just assume that all species have the same gestation period as humans do. An elephant for instance has the gestation period of about 22 months, a whale about 16 months, a horse about 12 months, and cat and dogs about 58 DAYS... What about rabbits and rats? Oh about 22 days. My point is some species will repopulate their losses in a matter of days depending on how advanced their technology is or how fertile they are (we have no idea how aliens do their funny business and we don't want to know-just saying). So wiping out half the population isn't going to solve anything, quite the contrary. Humans would take about thirty to forty years to repopulate. In the meantime, you're going to have chaos and destruction following when people are suddenly disappearing when cars are suddenly crashing, planes are falling from the skies and nuclear reactors are going off or when nuclear silos are suddenly unguarded. All this would require more resources to be used to contain the chaos that would follow. Earth is tiny and we have limited resources, but the Universe has UNLIMITED resources! The Universe is very huge, LIKE HUMONGOUS HUGE! Any species that has mastered space technology can simply colonise an asteroid or planet and mine the heck out of it. Now, Thanos has a magic gauntlet which theoretically can give him whatever his giant heart desires. Even Thanos eventually acknowledges that his original plan is dumb and decides to recreate the Universe. Now THAT should have been his original plan. That I could understand. The Avengers used time travel to fix their problems... (Sigh-this is literally the laziest writing ever). The first time he snapped his fingers and kills half the Universe's population he becomes a gardener... A gardener! That is his endgame? Pointless genocide: check! Now I will go to my cucumber and tomato paradise: check! I wonder if Dr. Strange saw this in every one of his 14,000,605 outcomes and lost his mind. Did Dr Strange get so frustrated with all those versions ending up with Thanos gardening that he just gave up and gave him the stone? Why didn't Thanos dedicate himself to botany instead of being a warlord? I bet that by 14,000,606 it was the first time that it didn't end up with Thanos ending up in his cucumber and tomato paradise. So Ironman died because of some vegetables. That one version that Dr Strange wanted. Now let's talk about a geriatric Captain America (how did the writers come up this). Captain America goes back in time to be with the love of his life... How charming! Except that it isn't. He is a superhero with powers and knowledge of the future and the cold war and other really important stuff. Is he going to sit back while Hydra takes over SHIELD and destroys the very America he loves so much? What about Bucky who is being used as the Winter Soldier? I don't know about you but the Cap I know wouldn't just stand by and do nothing for 70 years. Hundreds of millions of dollars spent and twenty plus movies made just so Captain America could end up in a retirement home? No! Just no...",

137,2 October 2022,shamilmoorad,10, Never boring!!!!!!!,"I remember when Superman died and how in the comic book world there was shock, dismay and great out cry necessitating him coming back. It served the purpose of hooking the audience and holding them captive. The same thing was applied to Spock dying in Star Trek again proving successful in generating fan response and revenue. Before Endgame came out and I only had the second movie to go by, I knew they all had to come back and I also knew that time travel played a part in it as there are only so many ways to come back. Sure enough, Endgame time-traveled and brought them back. The formula still works. Logically speaking, Disney didn't spend mutli-billions to kill everyone off however in the comic book world of which I keep reminding myself that anything is possible they can get away with these things. Knowing this before hand diminished my enjoyment of the Endgame but it wasn't limited to just that either. I am watching after everyone is brought back and they still couldn't defeat Thanos as a group or individually and that is without the stones mind you. With the stones they prevail making the stones more important than any Marvel character known. Before you vote on my sharing, be advised I have been reading comics for decades and was raised in that world and even collected them. I support and encourage the comic book world but would like them to keep it closer to reality than all-out fantasy suspension of major beliefs. One last thing. They keep using God as in OMG or other variations which totally contradicts the comic book world. That shouldn't be in the script for GOD is the ultimate super-hero and his comic would outsell everyones. Keep it real and I'll keep coming back.",

139,28 April 2019,JamesAlvarez520,6, Eh,"A movie review must be without desire or force.
This is the first film of Avengers Saga in which I found about 10 mistakes and so I am disappointed and very dissatisfied.
1. ) What would happen if Winston Churchill or Hitler of 1930 come to 2019 and got killed by someone ? Certainly the past will be charged, but the movie says nothing will change.
What would happen if you go to the past of year 1930 and killed Hitler ? Of course the the past will be charged but the movie says nothing will change.
2.) Caption America is a man, then how could he able to successfully and permanently use the hammer -🔨 Mjolnir ?
3.) Do you know the name of the place which created the 🔨 Mjolnir or weapons of Asgardians ? How can Avengers's laboratory more capable than that place (Nidavellir). In the Endgame there was no harm to Infinity Gruntlet of Avengers even after 2 times use. But the Gruntlet of Infinity War movie, created at Nidavellir, was destroyed only after 1 time use.
4. ) How was it possible for Iron Man to hold and successfully use all the six Infinity Stones. He is simply a man or half robot.
5. ) In Endgame, Thor went to his past and got his hammer and returned to his future with that hammer. Then, what would happen with the Thor of the past ? Suppose we went to 6 August 1945 and returned to the future after stealing atomic bombs, then what would happen with Japan ? Suppose we went to 1940 and kidnapped Stalin and returned to the future with him. Then what would happen with WW2 and the USSR ?
6. ) A man can create more capable weapon than God ? A man can handle a powerful weapon of God ? We can change our past without changing our present or future ?",

The emphasis switches from lavish, effects-driven demonstrations of universe-saving heroism to the more personal cost of heroism.

160,4 September 2021,Greyrat2,9, The end of an Era. Onto the next one.,"After seeing Infinity War i was so excited to see this movie. I must say i was rather disappointed. This movie was not awful, there are some really good scenes but there were so many things that annoyed me.
Thor - he was literally turned into a joke. Ruined his entire character and back story,.
Hulk - did he actually do anything? No! absolutely ruined his character. After being useless in the last movie i honestly thought he would redeem himself in this one. It does not happen.
Captain Marvel - Why create such a powerful character then miss her out of 90% of the movie? When she does finally appear i was expecting an epic fight scene between her and Thanos...... no! nothing. They literally have a little scuffle and that's the end of it. Then you don't see her again until the very end of the movie.
The time travel story made no sense - i can't even begin to type about that.you'll see if/when you watch. I will just say this - The Thanos the Avengers were fighting was based before all of the Avengers movies - which means after killing him, the first movies would never have happened. thats just one.
The first half of the movie was a little slow paced, i was thinking ""is something going to happen"". The end battle was good but it was WAY too short and there was so much going on that I couldn't concentrate on one thing. Plus i do not understand how Thanos was so powerful without the infinity stones.
The weapon Thor created in Infinity war was capable of killing Thanos but, for some reason Thor couldn't defeat him with not one, but 2 weapons. Speaking of weapons, I hated the fact that Captain America was able/worthy of wielding Thor's hammer - NO! its Thor's weapon. I felt like it took power away from the characters.
Like i said - not awful, but nowhere near as good as Infinity War (which i would rate a 9). I rated this movie a 6 because that's an average rating, and i think this movie is average.",
161,8 May 2019,Weirdo-Magnet,6, NOT what i was expecting.,"Don't get me wrong, the movie is actually solid in terms of acting and special effects, being it way too long. The big issue here is that 'Infinity War' raised the bar so high, this is just an unworthy sequel. In three hours of movie, you actually get some credible story for no more than 10 minutes. The time-travel solution always looked likely but how it developed was way too predictable. There are way too many plot holes and easy way outs for the story to actually go where it is supposed to go. Some of the heroes are conveniently placed in certain situations out of nowhere and the impending happy ending is always pretty clear to whoever puts some thought rather than just trying to be entertained! I would not watch this again, probably never, unlike 'Infinity War'.",

166,5 May 2019,wall_o,10, I loved Endgame BUT...,"The heroes leaving it out all there and sacrificing their lives in the end really speaks to the soul. Black widow fighting to sacrifice herself was so sad and beautiful at the same time. I cried when Iron Man finally let go. Gwyneth Paltrow absolutely crushed it in that scene, her telling him that they're gonna be ok and he can let go...😭. Gut-wrenching! Emotional scenes all over; Captain America seeing his love for the first time in ages throw the window with the blinds, that was great stuff. Iron Man's relationship with his daughter...just all kinds of really awesome moments. Heroes were brave and sacrificial, they showed true love and it was awesome. There were a couple liberal-ish, pseudophilosophical bits here and there. ""Don't be who you're supposed to be, be who you are."" Sounds like irresponsible rubbish to me. The redefining of what a hero by Thor's Mom made no sense, but it was brief and negligible. And the little moment where all the girls get together to fight was patronizing in my opinion.
Yes, some of the writing was cheesy. It wasn't as bad as some are complaining about. The 3 hours didn't feel bad to me. The movie kept moving along and kept me engaged and interested. Anyone who gets that bent out of shape about the time travel stuff needs to just stop watching movies. If you can't suspend your belief at all you can't enjoy a movie. Captain America being able to wield Thor's hammer was cool but I have no idea where that came from. But I also didn't really care at that point. It didn't offend me and it was fun and it didn't take away from anything good in the fim. The score was good, visuals were 10/10 of course. The final battle scene was the best large battle on screen since LOTR battles. It was really good, I am looking forward to watching it again sometime!",

Disregarding plot holes, which don't really matter to much in an action film, there are a few aspects which brought the film low.",
169,29 April 2019,grenage,6, A bit self-indulgent,"The hardest thing to do is end something. The ending of a story, novel, or movie is probably the hardest thing to write. This is not the climax and falling action, but the resolution, where all the dangling threads are tied up and resolved. Very few writers can create one with supreme satisfaction - mostly because in this day and age writers want sequels and franchises. Avengers Endgame is the pinnacle of Marvel movies. It is a masterpiece of the super-hero genre. It gives closure, and resolution.
The movie picks up almost immediately after Thanos snapped half the world out of existence. The remaining Avengers, Iron Man (Tony Stark), War Machine (Don Cheedle), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and Rocket (Bradley Cooper) are trying to gather their wits after they had their asses handed to them.
Tony is on his way back to Earth from Titan. His only companion is Nebula (Karen Gillian). Fortunately, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) comes to the rescue. Bringing them back to Earth, they are reunited ... for a moment. Tony wants nothing to do with them after Cap's betrayal. He goes back to Pepper.
The remaining heroes track down Thanos (Josh Brolin) and find the Infinity Stones have destroyed themselves, as well as him. Now, what do we do?
Five years later, a van in San Francisco has its computer activated by a mouse. It activates the shrinking device that left Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) stranded in the shrunken universe. He comes back - but the five year isolation was only five hours to the Ant Man. He traverses the nation to find the Avengers. When he learns of what happened, he has an idea. The microscopic universe has entry and exit points in time.
Yes, they can travel back in time and find the Infinity Stones, bring them back, and snap everyone back into existence. Hey, you have to realize that time travel was going to come into this sooner or later. The Avengers need Tony to figure out a way to take out the random effects, but he is tied too much to Pepper (Gwenyth Paltrow), and their daughter, Morgan.
Tony, though, cannot back out of a possibility of setting things right. He is onboard with the idea, so three teams travel back to different points. Tony, Bruce, Steve, and Scott (hey, my name's Steve Scott!) head to New York after the Avengers battle. Roadie, Nebula, Nadia, and Clint (Jeremy Renner) return to the stellar world where two other stones exist. Rocket and Thor return to Asgaarrd before its destruction to fetch a couple of others.
As they find the stones, they find themselves - as well as a slew of MCU characters that helped and hindered them on the way. Loki, Brumlow, Sitwell, Pierce (Robert Redford) all have their cameos as former HYDRA secret operatives. Of course, it would be a sin not to have Tom Hiddleston return as Loki. Tony and Steve go to another spot where Steve catches a glimpse of Peggy Carter (Haylee Atwell), and Tony gets to have some words with his father, Howard Stark (John Slattery).
Thor gets to see Jane again (Natalie Portman), as well as his mother, Frigga (Rene Russo). Rocket has to work hard and convince him to take the stones back. Of course, Thor cannot leave without one particular thing.
Meanwhile, Clint and Nadia have to retrieve the Soul Stone. They need a soul to get it. At the same time, Thanos, who is alive at this point, realizes the Nebula of the past is having glitches. He and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) are able to figure out what they are doing there. Realizing their plan, he has to stop them and make sure his plan comes through.
You can tell this all-star cast was handled well, providing story, action, laughs, and even tears. A few of these heroes sacrifice themselves for others. They get to reconcile themselves over past mistakes, regrets, and get to redeem themselves. They are reunited with loves ones lost five years ago when Thanos snapped his fingers. And they fight together against a foe for the first time since Avengers Age of Ultron. They were one team.
Someone could easily nit-pick this one, especially on the time travel. However, the ending brings so much satisfaction. Between the sacrifices, the second chances, the characters all have their resolutions tied up, with no post-credit scenes. Some of the character arcs are messy, but the movie provides an emotional satisfaction unheralded in motion picture history. Avengers Endgame gets a perfect score.",

I'm not saying it wasn't entertainment to watch but the feeling is that all heroes were forced to fit in a movie paying a big price to the story.

Nebula opens the time portal while Hulk snaps his fingers with all five gems to restore human lives on earth but no one questions what caused the war on earth?

And watching the fight at the end was so fun and good to watch. It is good to see that Marvel make good progress as they go along, well most of the time anyway. It is good to also see TOM HOLLAND in the film right at the end to because it gives him a chance as well as the others. He did really well as well like he always dose. And it was funny that Hulk got to have a picture with the kids and Ant-man offers and doesn't get to have a photo. It is also my favorite Marvel movie, like I said because the togetherness is so good to see. It was a good ending to, to see that it had most of the characters on their or at least the main ones. It was also funny at times as well, especially the time machine bit.

195,24 April 2019,schmid-maximilian,10, Best Marvel Movie Ever,"After seeing ENDGAME for the second time, I'm ready to write my review, which will be difficult to do without spoilers. I find it interesting that those who gave INFINITY WAR a 10 were disappointed in this movie and I think I know why (for I am one of them) - INFINITY WAR took so many characters, such different tones in the worlds of the different heroes, with such a big story arc, yet managed to tell real stories interweaving the larger story, not just 3 minute cameos. ENDGAME, although having real moments of pathos, missed that balance. Despite moments of humour (many at cost of Thor's character, which I didn't appreciate), this movie basically had one tone and I was disappointed how some of our heroes were marginalized (and given bad haircuts). I know it was the end of an era, a passing of the torch. As a friend put it, ""Character development was never the focus of this movie, that was what all the previous movies were for...it was a perfect wrap up and set up for the next arc."" I agree this was all about the ensemble but there were edits (or complete changes) to our heroes' journeys for which I didn't care (too many stories were left off screen) with one exception (Nebula has a character arc). So, that's why I didn't enjoy this as much as INFINITY WAR yet it was still a great movie with great performances by all the cast, poignant moments of loss, great montages in the battle scenes and a real challenge demanding great cost. Kudos to the Russos and Kevin Feige for their hands at the tiller for this era. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Superheroes Action Adventure}",

216,17 July 2019,FluffyPantsReviews,10, How?,"Avengers Endgame Review
Score - 10/10
Avengers Endgame could be well described as the most complicated storyline in the entire Marvel history not only because it had to wrap up a story of eleven years but also because of the complex solution to an inevitable situation that The Avengers try to achieve with the avenging not being the major part of the story.
The three hour runtime was well utilized by giving more time to establish the characters' humanistic attachments and the losses they suffered; not only in this movie, but from the very moment they've been incepted into this franchise.
Unlike the previous outings, the characters differ in their choices and these contrasts in their choices lead up to one massive and satisfying final battle which may not end the entire MCU, but certainly does end a glorious era of the long franchise.
The entire movie, especially the final battle was a huge fan service as it included everything a Marvel fan could possibly dream of.
PS: There is no Post - Credits Scene in the film, but it is worth waiting for the entire credits to roll.",

218,10 May 2019,nikhilvyas07,8, Flawed but amazing conclusion to the Infinity storyline,"If you go into this movie thinking that you're going to get an Infinity Wars part II I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed. I enjoyed the movie, but I was hoping for so much more, and yes, I know, when you go into a movie with high expectations the chances are that you're setting yourself up for disappointment, but the more I think about this movie the more I hate the direction it took.
Now..obvious mistakes aside (Capt America with the power of lightning?...really??...it was literally explained in Ragnarok) the way they destroyed some of the best characters was completely frustrating, Lebowski Thor?....Slimey Hulk?.......a Thanos that you couldn't empathise with even though you knew it was wrong?.....meh....
The thing is, once you introduce time travel into a movie you're going to spend the rest of your days wondering 'why didn't they just....' unless it's done really intelligently, unfortunately this falls very short of that mark, and as whole...when I think about the film now, it just feels like a bit of an over emotional fan film, an MCU scrapbook of nostalgia that despite being 3 hours long...still felt incredibly rushed.
The biggest moment in ten years of Marvel movies was 'The Snap' ...yet in Endgame you don't even get to see any of effect of reversing it??....apart from a phone call from Hawkeye's wife?....baffling.
Throughout most of this film I felt like I was watching a parody, it's something you still have to watch.....and you'll probably enjoy it, just as long as you don't think about it afterwards.",

Also balance of heroes in the first movie was done much better than this movie which really should have been called Captain America & Iron Man + Avengers.

* How was Captain Marvel able to locate the ship Tony Stark was on at the beginning of the film?
* Why use ""Quantum Realm"" when the majority of the audience will get confused and lost in it?
* Why did Captain Marvel say she was going to fight Thanos solo when she, Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man couldn't even take him down without a use of a gauntlet? Is she really that arrogant?
* Why was Thanos awesome in the first movie, but became a generic villain in Endgame?
* Why did the writers do an awesome job on the infinity war, but fall hard in Endgame? Did someone just tell them, ""let's put all the jokes and scenes you guys want and hopefully it makes sense."" Because that's exactly what it felt like.
* Why doesn't doing anything in the past affect the future? It felt so cringeworthy seeing interactions in previous movies that weren't meant to happen.
* Why has Thor become Batman of the DC universe? Do directors and producers LOVE destroying characters that we love? Seems like it.
* Thor's mother didn't need to be ""trained by witches"" to know that her son Thor was different from her son she saw only moments earlier. So why even bring that up?
* Did everyone who ""died"" in infinity war go to a special spirit world of wakanda and just remain there till 5 years later according to spider-man?
* Why couldn't have anyone simply put on the gauntlet and wiped out Thanoses army? And why didn't Thanos destroy everybody who was a threat to him in infinity war?
* Why did a rat start Endgame by returning ant-man? That seems awfully convenient doesn't it?
* How can Captain America pick up Thor's hammer and even use lightning when he couldn't pick it up in the first avengers movie?
* Where was Captain Marvel most of the movie? Was she vacationing?
* Why was the first hour so slow, The second hour and a half talking about quantum physics that no one understands, and the last 30 minutes of the film fighting when anyone could have simply worn the glove and wiped out thanoses army?
* How did Scarlett Witch seemingly become more powerful than even Captain Marvel?
* Why didn't anyone save Black Widow when everything else can be done with convenience? Did no one just not want to save her because there was no purpose and it just gave them rage to fight?",

230,24 April 2019,lars-417-110658,10, Simply great,"When I say that Avengers Engame is the most overrated movie of 2019, I mean that people and critics praised it more, the movie, yes, you could say that it is ""good"", but not so much for everyone to go crazy and say that it is the best superhero movie, a great example of how overrated it would be like, this movie was recently titled as the highest grossing movie in the history of cinema in general. Yes, if the film is very striking with its colors and all those characters, but simply what in Avengers Infinity War ""struggled"" to maintain the quality of the plot, here it simply does not matter, I just say that Captain Marvel suddenly find Tony and the other lady, they do not explain at any time how he did to find them, yes, if I know that the marvel lovers have already drawn their theories on that, to cover up the lazy mistakes of the writers. In Infinity War we saw the Thor plus Thor of the Thores, but now he is an obese alcoholic, the movie is not taken seriously sometimes, and that is a great example, or that Tony gets angry at first with Captain America because he does not It was there, blah, blah, blah, but if we use our brains, you will remember that in Infinity War he had the opportunity to call him and he did not, so I'm sorry Iron man lovers, but Tony had no right to get angry, and if we analyzed him well really Captain Marvel was a filler character, we all believed that this character would have great weight for the story but no, I thought that they did not try hard in their movie because they were going to want all this, but no, you can feel that the writers they didn't know what to do with it, and something they did go over with was the rat that accidentally released Ant-man, I'm just saying that you are more likely to see a cow flying outside your house to have that happen, which I leave wondering if the truck was closed, then how did that rat could get in? The time travel is very badly done, quantum physics clearly says that two equal objects cannot be together at the same time in the same place, so that fight of the American captains is impossible, and the rest is not even said , for example, Captain America in the end stays in the past meaning that The Avengers never had Captain America, which means that everything he did never happens, which leaves me wondering. Why did nothing change? Why is there no temporary paradox or any consequence for your decision? It's simple, the movie is so shameless in the sense that it doesn't care about those rules and does what it gives the gift wins. After that for no reason, Steve gives his position to Falcon because ............. in order to make a reference to the comics, he prefers to give his position to an African-American who he met recently Than your lifelong friend. Something that I honestly didn't understand, was how the gauntlet works, are you supposed to think about what you want and what happens? I don't know, I think, because Hulk throne his fingers and half of the universe that had disappeared comes back, but here goes the problem, if you think about it that is the worst thing he had to do, Thanos technically had already saved the universe by reducing the population , and that was something that the Avengers failed to understand, but that is the least, the problem is that being logical, of that half world literally literally, I wonder where the hell are all these people going to live? 5 years have passed and obviously their houses must already be inhabited by someone else, or their jobs, and logically they should have had an economic imbalance, but hey, the Avengers don't care about that and they are happy because they saved their friends, just I say his plan was very selfish. If you think about it really, the one who lost the most was Thanos, his goal was really not bad, that for starters, even in a part of the movie Steve tells Natasha something that the planet is less polluted Thanos was looking for his stones for a long time time and when he found the last one to get it he had to sacrifice his daughter, he also lost his friends, henchmen or not dry were, then after saving the universe, he just wanted to live in peace and eat his broth, but the Avengers do not arrive and they kill him, then they make a plan for all their sacrifices to go to waste, poor Thanos. To tell the truth that Hulk is now Hulk-Banner does not really bother me, what I would have liked is that they would have spent time on that, for example a movie of that would not be bad. But well now talk about how good this movie has, and I'd like to start with those little big details, which would be like Hulk uses a pencil to press the keys because his fingers are too big, or that Iron Man gives the hug to that Spiderman did not want to give him at Homecomeming, also that Bucky tells Steve that he is going to miss him although he is supposed to only leave for a few seconds, but it is because he knows him enough to know that Steve is going to live his life, and that that would be the last time he sees him young and for me that he is the best he would be being that in the final battle with Thanos, Thor every blow he hits is directed at Thanos's head. And as brave as it has been to kill Ironman, it was really a bit forced, although the only thing I managed to sacrifice was to avoid the salvation of the universe. I will analyze the advantage and cons. Pros: -Give more years of life to humanity before it destroys itself. -They managed to complete their goal. Cons: -To condemn humanity. -Leave his wife a widow. -Let your daughter an orphan. - Wreck the work of a visionary. -Kill oneself. But the point is that the greatest hero of Marvel was sacrificed, the man who created Ultron, the man who caused the civil war between his companions and then locked them in, the man who created all those marvel villains like the Vulture , Mystery, Mandarin, etc. But hey, goodbye Ironman. So and I have two questions for marvel lovers. How is it possible for a human being to create a gauntlet that supports the gems of infinity, when Infinity War told us that only a certain metal made by certain dwarves can do it? The only conclusion I reach is that Tony is a god or a celestial being. I also understand that if he is a god, he would be Ojo de Alcon, since he is in a moment of the movie he grabs a gem of the infinite with his hand and in guardians of the galaxy I learned that only a celestial or a god can grab the gems without dying, and in this movie, Ojo de alcon grabs it and nothing happens, so I understand that this man is a god or a celestial. Do not? Something that I admire about this movie is that it is very good lying, to this I mean that it is so good lying that it made half the world believe that it is the best film not only of the year, not only of the genre of Super-heroes, but of the best movies in history, they are good lying that with the jokes, the characters, the fights and all those colors of this movie, it covers all those plot holes and makes people believe that it is an almost perfect movie, so it is of Men recognize that this movie cheated the world and almost fooled me. In conclusion Avengers Endgame is a very good movie lying, with a great final battle, and with many plot holes, I just want to say that I found it very difficult to put the rating on this movie, it was between 4 to 6, but then I decided that This is only a 6/10, even though deep down in my heart I know it deserves less.",

And I really think they should have killed off Hawkeye (who had become almost unlikable / a complete psychopath0 as opposed to Black Widow (who is a fan favorite). There were also a lot of inconsistencies with regards to bringing people back from the dead - they were brought back 5 years later, but they had not aged (while everyone else around them did age). Yet somehow, Peter Parker is still going to high school with all of the same high school friends who have miraculously NOT aged (unless they had all been deleted by Thanos, I find this highly unlikely). Captain Marvel, while very cool, was made to be too powerful. They also waited far too long to bring everyone back - not until the very end of the movie.

257,28 May 2020,waqassaleem-85201,10, A great watch,"Though it has been repeated time and time again, it is still quite insane to think about an end to 11 years and 22 movies. A cinematic universe that for quite a few of us, we have grown up with. A universe that despite all the bad that may have gone on in one's life or in the world, we could always look forward to one day out of the year where we could escape that and enjoy 2 hours of watching our childhood heroes kick butt on the silver screen. A cinematic universe, that I quite frankly thought was impossible to successfully conclude, until the Russo Brothers proved me wrong.
Any way you slice it, Avengers Endgame should go down as one of the toughest movies to write. Bringing a true and satisfying ending to 11 years of stories in a universe where the death is never truly accepted, the cast size seems never-ending, and an overabundance of story arcs could drive any writer insane should prove a near impossible task. Yet here we are as smart, conscious decisions are made throughout the movie. The reduced team size allows for a focus both character and story wise that makes it a movie easy to follow (for the most part) despite still being among the most ambitious Marvel movies. Surprise callbacks and fan-service moments act like a Greatest Hits album giving fans a true appreciation for the greatness of the Infinity Saga. Despite the temptation to just rely on these callbacks, where the film truly shines like any other Marvel movie is with its characters. Through the course of the 4,5, and 6 movies the Original Six Avengers have appeared in, several decisions have been made that not only affected each character but changed their overall perspectives. The Russo Brothers dedication to these characters is seen in the masterfully crafted scenes that continue or conclude the appropriate arcs. All while still producing shots, scenes, and moments that created the best cinematic experience I have ever had. To put it simply, for 3 hours I simply got to be a 10-year-old cheering, laughing, and crying with the heroes that I have grown up with, idolized, and loved for my whole life. For that I thank the entire Marvel family!",

260,26 April 2019,sivadparks-89786,10, I'm convinced people who have poor reviews didn't understand the movie,"The finale of the lengthy series featuring a constellation of Marvel's luminaries, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a watchable superhero flick that merges real life interactions and explosive fantasy. Featuring A-List stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johansson as Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, The Hulk and Black Widow respectively the film finds our heroes in the eternal tale of the battle between good and evil and some stones. Decent acting with simple but adequate special effects help carry the view. The biggest snag of the whole enterprise is its length. Clocking in at three hours the span strains an already shaky script and the mature viewer's patience. Perhaps I've long outgrown Fantasy movies and seeing full grown men and women in skimpy outfits playing cartoon characters challenged belief and the overall silliness of it can't be shaken off. Maybe it's not just me; the bored, going through the motions look of the actors especially at the start of the film seems to mirror this. The thought of having to wear those tight stretchy outfits for the umpteenth time and having to memorize and utter those prepubescent lines were too much despite the hefty paycheck. A massive hit despite all of that, I still remember the loooooong lines in the cinemas to watch this and I guess the masses are basically dorks who'll embrace fantasies on the big screen to forget themselves and their lives.

This film revisited many of the past installments via the time traveling aspect. I thought this was going to be terrible but they honestly did it very well. The whole MCU is tied together quite well. We are also treated with some meaningful and sacrificial character deaths that will likely be permanent. The final battle is a true masterpiece and honestly made me tear up a little bit (I am not one to cry). When Cap lifts and wields Mjolnir, I wanted to stand up and cheer. Truly an incredible scene.

265,22 May 2019,abdalla-76871,10, End game and end my heart 💔😪,"Walt Disney Pictures most anticipated movie of the year did not disappoint. Without spoiling the movie too much, this Marvel Studios film directed by the Russo Brothers was nearly a cinematic masterpiece. However, there were a few things that that drop it a level or two from being 10 out of a 10. The main one is the overuse of story convenience & plot armor. There is way too many Deux Ex Machina moments in the redemption journey of the Avengers team figuring out, how to undo the effects of Thanos' (Motion Capture & Voice Acting by Josh Brolin) actions from the last movie 2018 'Infinity War' that really took me out of the story. One of them is the whole rescue of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) in outer space. It was not needed as most of the media trailers already spoil that Stark was able to make it back to Earth. Not only that, but it was a bit jarring & little too hard to believe that Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) was able to find a small ship in the vast cosmos. That scene didn't really belong in the movie. The film could have used that time to explore the depths of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) depression and trauma. It was a bit much to see the God of Thunder reduce into an over the top comedy relief character. The writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely should have treat his extreme lost in a nuanced and meaningful way. They could had cut back a little bit on the laughs involving him. As for the other sequences of the Avengers dealing with their post snap despair. It was fine for the most part, even if it's a bit slow. I just wish the world that they live in, should had been more chaotic & apocalyptic dystopia. Nevertheless, clocking in at three hours and one minute runtime, this twenty-second film entry of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was already a very long watch. It really needed better pacing. It had too many 1989 'Back to the Future Part 2"" time travel type scenarios & recycled footage callbacks. Some of them, are not that interesting, such as the Asgard trip. Those scenes could had been more compelling, if the setting were changed to them going to the Collector's hideout in Knowhere during the events of 2014's 'Guardian of the Galaxy'. Plus, the story would had been more compact as the Power & Reality Stones were at the same place. Nevertheless, others time travel moments like the one in the 1970s were not really needed, when you think about it. Don't get me wrong, it was a very emotional moment for Tony Stark to meet his dad, but, much of that time, could had been used to establish tears for other characters, such as the tragic love story between Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) & Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson). Natasha kinda got the short straw here. After all, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Widow's skills in stealth and deception would have been better suited with any other mission. The superhuman demigods should had explore Vormir. Nevertheless, the time travelling sequences were highly entertaining. I just wish they focus a little more on establishing the David Deutsch rules how it honestly works, because where it stands. It's highly complicated & confusing. There is a lot of inconsistencies & contradictions that really stands out. Most of them, involves past versions of characters coming to the prime timeline future, & Captain America (Chris Evans) actions toward the end. Even Ant Man (Paul Rudd) being able to use endless amount of Pym particles is somewhat not coherent. I hate that the writers brush those unanswered plot holes off, because I really curious, on how Steve Rogers honestly return those stones back in their time periods without screwing up time even worst or getting caught. Those unseen moments could had been really interesting action scenes. Regardless, the ones we do witness, were fine, even if they were CGI heavy. There is just a few nitpicks. The Sanctuary II ship opens fire point-blank with all its cannons on the Avengers base until it's nothing but a smoldering crater but it doesn't even manage to injure, never mind kill, any of the people inside is really hard to believe. Those who do die, are somewhat predictable. Also, Carol Danvers's big rescue in the end, really does make the character, nothing more than a dull shrew, walking Deux ex Machina. To make it worst, there was a very phony put in political progressive movement message in Endgame's climax that pays tribute to the women of Marvel that really doesn't fit. It seem awkwardly push as fan service rather than fitting within the logistic of that scene. While, the movie does jump around, a lot; nearly every scene was a very heart pounding experience built on fine heroic. The goods outweigh the bad. Surprisingly, the movie gave, enough screen time to, nearly all the marvel characters, without, turning into a giant mess of a film. Nearly every performer, including the cameos in this movie did a great job. As for the humor, it was fine. Lots of hilarious moments for a surprisingly dark film. The music score by composer Alan Silvestri is beautiful to listen to. In the end, it will be very interesting to see what dangers, a universe without the infinity stones will bring. Hopefully the new crop of heroes can indeed stop them. Can't wait for Phrase 4. Until then, this entry in the MCU is worth repeat viewings. It's highly recommended. This movie entertain us with enough to overlook all the flaws. It's really is, a must watch. It's marvelous.",

But everything else was super this is the Best end in my opinion but we will miss Iron man and captain america.,
297,8 September 2019,superwithoutname,9, The Best end that avengers could have,"Maybe because Infinity ended the way it did which was epic and it was such a step up from anything else, Endgame was never going to be able to top that. Everyone knows going in who's going to win in the end but how they got there was a job well done. Some real surprises especially with Thor but I was truly gutted with the Hulk. I don't know if that was taken from the comics but the Hulk is the Hulk right, the angry uncontainable green monster from Avengers Assemble. This was Hulk-light. Boring Hulk. What a waste. He wouldn't come out to play in Infinity and then the next time he's like the Beast from X-Men! Strange decision for me.
This was easily the most emotional of the films as I teared up a couple of times which hardly happens to me and I guess I'm actually sad that it's the end of an era. So to sum up, excellent and the love and effort put into the film is obvious for any to see. The Hulk will always be a thorn though whenever I watch this movie again.",

This movie was fine, but it was not great. It did a somewhat satisfactory job of bringing together all of the previous MCU movies...certainly no easy task. However, there was very little action, most of the jokes fell flat, and the emotional scenes didn't reverberate. Also, there were just too many obvious plot holes, both within the whole time-travel theme and in general. It just wasn't a great story or a great job of storytelling. I'll admit that I'm not an emotional person, but anyone who said they cried (especially some of the critics who said they cried, cried, laughed, cried, cheered, and cried some more) has never seen an actual well-made movie with a great story. I didn't cry at the end of Infinity War, and I certainly didn't get even the slightest bit emotional in Endgame. I also saw critics who said everyone stood and cheered when it was over. I definitely didn't experience that. Our theater just sat pretty quietly with quite a few conversations about the gaping plot holes.

My issue with the first Avengers was Loki being so non threatening, and everyone I talk to about this seems to agree, however the breakthrough at the time was just to have all their heroes on screen together.
You then had Avengers Age of Ultron, which had the baddie being a creation of Tony Stark, which I found unexciting, despite it being a fun watch.

Where the equally masterful Infinity War was almost one long action climax, this is less about fights. Which doesn't mean it doesn't have any. Or that they're anything less than excellent. And this film is definitely never boring. This focuses on character exploration. Every member of the original Avengers team, and a handful individuals that aren't, all get significant depth. I remain one of the few people who argue that Age of Ultron did deliver that, albeit in small concentrated format. This easily tops that. Everyone is pushed into a situation new to them.

I think that the whole plot has been presented too fast-paced, but the plot's main subject is really both interesting and solid. The biggest plot hole is about Captain America's return in the past, because the movie doesn't show what has really happened while he was in the past, using the quantum realm technology. How did he return the stones? Where did he return them? What enemies and obstacles encountered and most important of all, why is he old? It's even the same Captain America, from the actual timeline, or it's another one, from a parallel universe?

338,1 June 2020,turagjubayer,10, Emotional movie,"I'll keep it as short as possible and spoiler free, I didn't expect this movie to be better than Infinity War but it was a disappointment, unfortunately...
The cons first:
a) This movie is almost an MCU clip show. I won't spoil the plot but to me it felt repetitive. Like eating reheated pizza.
b) Too slow. Do you remember the action sequences and the fast pace of Infinity War? Forget that. Literaly there's almost no action for the first one hour and a half!
c) Dispropotional screen time. Unlike infinity War, the majority of superheroes have too little screen time (I'm talking about fighting scenes). Again, I can't spoil anything but some heroes have two or three lines and a ten second action scene.
d) Thanos himself. Unfortunatelly Thanos wasn't as good (or should I say... bad) as he was in Infinity War, he almost feels like a heavy bag with a few lines (and I mean few).
e) Predictable plot (maybe that's only me).
f) The final big battle feels hasty and bad edited. There are too much going on on screen with a very little time for each character.
g) It has a pessimistic and dark tone.
Now the pros:
a) Solid conclusion. The movie is a solid conclusion of MCU's phase 3 (and perhaps MCU itself).
b) Good humor. That's not a surprise for a Marvel movie, there's plenty of tasteful humor and in the correct amount.
c) Good performances. Nothing to add here.
d) No political agendas. I hate it when it happens and thankfully this movie is ok (there are one or two cringeworthy scenes though, but nothing importand).
e) There are some good action scenes and the effects are awesome.
Overall, it felt rushed and it lacks the majestic feeling of Infinity War. I can remember plenty of scenes in Infinity War which gave me goosebumps, unfortunately there's none in Endgame...
Final verdict: 6/10 when I compare it to Infinity War (it's unavoidable), 7/10 as a stand-alone MCU film.

And this is a good thing as it has a lot of new content that builds off that foundation. Avengers: Endgame is filled with some shocking twists, heart wrenching deaths, and amazing cinematic moments you will never forget. If you even slightly enjoy the Marvel films, you cannot pass up seeing this movie. If Infinity War was daring in using most of its run time for villain focus and battles, this one is unique in how different its three acts are from one another. It makes the film quite re-watchable despite its length. And it all leads up to a finale you have to see to believe. Characters like Iron Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Captain America shine like never before, as the writing for characters is incredibly strong in this movie. I would not say this is the best Avengers film. Its pacing can seem sluggish the first time around and some characters are treated as jokes more than they ought.

350,26 April 2019,jackgdemoss,9, A nearly perfect ending to an unprecedented movie-going journey,"First of all, visually this is amazing movie. I saw it in Imax 3d and i feared i will not enjoy it , because action movies with fast scenes dont feel so good in 3d, but because of its slower pace, one could really enjoy the scenery, especially the space scenes. I generally liked the plot(going back in time etc), although there are serious holes in the plot but whatever, its a comic book fantasy movie so anything goes, right. Going back and revisiting crucial moments was also done very well,funny and reminding of all the other great MCU movies, it really tied up everything well. There was not so many obvious jokes, but still few good funny moments.
The downside for me is how I never can understand how this superheros match their powers - like in the beginning, Captain Marvel grabs Thanos, Thor slices him up like a chunk of butter,. but on the end fight, she cannot get to him, and Thor fights him both with his axe and hammer, plus Captain America and Iron-man and they cannot do anything to him. Thanos has some strange looking blade which is obviously much stronger than all their weapons , and Captain Marvel. So this really bothers me even in the previous movies, is like the script writers can write whatever they want and anything goes, right. Again you can see, I can tolerate so much BS until i start to get bored and feel like i dont have an IQ less then 80 or im 12 years old.
I dont see why it had to be 3 hour long, they could easily cut down the drama BS and make it 2.5h. Also, I am really really sad that Black Widow is gone - she was the best for me, a true hero without any gadgets, super powers or powerful weapons. And finally, its sad that all american series and movies put a lot of point on the characters making a drama , fuss and blaming each other - adults and especially super heroes should be more balanced - and that was Natasha's part in the MCU, she was always so rational and calm .
I will watch this once more it comes out on Bluray but i dont i will be coming back more then that. Unlike the first Avangers, or even Infinity war..",

The writing was bad, the basic laws of time that they tried to follow were contradicted, and overall, it was just a terrible plot. I wish John Favreau directed the more significant Marvel movies...",
352,2 March 2021,cgbarr-73033,1," Terrible, sloppy, and disgraceful","Avengers: Endgame (2019) is the best Marvel movie ever made because I absolutely love that movie! I love the plots, characters, action and cinematography! I love the ending of the final battle! It was absolute epic! Wow!",
353,16 March 2022,charliehope-55381,10, Wow! This is the best Marvel movie that I ever seen!,"I wait this film without any patience. I hope that it would be one of the greatest film of MCU. My hope became the truth. In me point of view, this film is great from all aspects of cinema. Firstly, the story is amazing, the screenwriters did the great work, despite of 3 hours, no moments looks very long or boring. Twisted moments happen in the right place, most of actions of characters are logical. The authors have big attention to little details and ""easters"" due the film. Secondly, the cast is awesome, so many characters of comics together were the first time in the history. Some characters' lines ends, and this finish looks great (Iron Man and Captain America). Thirdly, the visual effects is wonderful.
So, it's one of greatest oan biggest film ever.",
354,16 April 2020,chubarova,10, We are in the Endgame now.,"Characters killed in Avengers: Infinity War weren't brought back by the 2nd snap. Vision and Loki were killed. Thanos wasn't actually killed at the end of Endgame, he was snapped in to non existence. Using Pym particles and the Antman suit, one could go back, retrieve the Infinity Stones, and with another snap Thanos can be brought back. In theory, anyone with Pym particles and the Antman suit could travel throughout time, retrieve the stones, return to the present, wipe out all life in the entire universe, then go back in time to the point the stones were taken.",
355,13 May 2021,jim921977,8, Is Thanos really gone?,From the beginning to end the characters are very alive and at the beginning we never going to believe that is gonna happened but it does and after that the movie been a roller coaster and the climax is the generator of goosebumps and at end for me its a pain to dilute the truth. Over all its an perfect ending to the greatest franchise in marvel universe.,
356,28 April 2019,prathikboyapati,9, Electrified and emoted,"Definitely not as good as its predecessor but one to be conjured with nevertheless.
The movie starts a bit slower than all MCU movies before it and it takes its precious time to get the action going, but once it does, its all forgiven and forgotten.
Although predictable, because let's face it, where could they go after Infinity Wars? It delivers on all fronts!
There were tears and laughter throughout the 3 hr long feature. The tears yanked out of you by Ant Man, Stark, Cap and Hawkeye and the laughter mainly by Thor who surprised everybody with his transformation, but also by Hulk/Banner who found a peaceful way to co-exist.
There were cameos sprinkled throughout the whole length of the movie, some very emotional, like Agent Carter, who actually didn't have to say a single word to get the tears flowing.
They tied up all the loose ends, revisited some great scenes from past beloved movies and, thankfully, did not give all the glory to insipid Captain Marvel, who despite being the most powerful of all the Avengers, delivers quite a forgettable performance.
There are some key characters who will definitely not be coming back, but there is still plenty left for future plots. Although it will feel a lot less exciting with some of the most beloved characters absent from now on.",

360,24 April 2019,keremblackstone,9, Every ending is a new beginning,"The first half felt sappy and chatty. I found myself fighting the Zzzz in this first half. But the second half felt like a time travel thriller (a la mission impossible team). The climax with the actual battle was good, like epic battles we have seen before from the Marvel Universe. I was disappointed that there wasn't an end scene. I have grown accustomed to expect an end scene leading up to a new Marvel movie so I felt jipped watching the ending credits and not seeing an end scene. I think it's like a 6 3/4 out of 10 and I rounded it up to 7/10",
361,30 April 2019,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,7, Mixed feelings,"I'm going to make a leap here, just to leep things simple. The cumulative effect of so called ""super heroes"" is to the true film fan what the white man was to Native Americans: End of life as they knew it. There are 25 actors in this, and it's really sad to see them become prostitutes, like their studios. Why do you think great actors and directors wouldn't be caught dead in these cartoon films? Because they are the antithesis to great film making. Its really sad. I understand my 13 year old daughter seeing something like this. I don't understand older, more mature people acting like these are real films becauseT they arent. They are like the cartoons you woukd watch, before the main attraction started. They all have been dumbed down for the masses to the same exact plot: Good versus Evil; always. I wouldn't, no couldn't; sit through 15 minute of this pablum, not even if you paid me a year's salary to watch. It""s woeful trash, and is ruining the film industry. Stanley Kubrick the master of all the great directors, is rolling over in his grave. You won't see the top directors making any of this trash. People like Abel Ferrara, Marty Scorcese, Ridley Scott, William Friedkin, Spike Lee, or Denis Villeneuve go near a movie such as this. Its all publicity! All you hear about is how much money is made in the opening weeks, but nothing about what the films are like. It makes me sick. I would rather have my teeth drilled without novacaine than watch this. The same goes for the best actors. No way you will see ever see people like Bobby DeNiro, Christopher Walken, Matt Damon, Colin Farrell, Ethan Hawke, Nicole Kidman, or Al Pacino in any of these movies. I understand completely. It's simple. They have integrity! Skip this woeful hyped up trash and go see a real film; not a cartoon.",

365,26 April 2019,tobybunning,10, Solid Round 2 after Infinity War,"Given the hype and the huge buildup to the opening of this movie, I wouldn't have expected any less of a reaction than what I find on these review boards. And to be fair, the film does encompass and bring to a finale a massive story line with a virtually complete cast of characters that form the Marvel Comics Universe. However a little bit of objectivity is in order, and the movie's current standing after three days of release (as I write this) is just a bit hard to fathom. At number five on IMDb's list of Top Rated Movies, I can only shake my head. Think of your absolutely favorite movie of all time, (unless this one is it), and ""Avengers: Endgame"" has just surpassed it. This is a pet peeve of mine and I've written about it before in my reviews, so I don't want to get carried away here. Suffice it to say that for me, any brand new release to achieve such a ranking isn't really a reflection to how good it is, but a response by the majority of fans who come to these pages to give it a top rating.",

My eyes actually rolled in the cinema when Scott Lang delivered his line ""yeah, like a time machine"". I knew straight away no matter how entertaining the rest of Endgame was, from here on in I would be picking holes in the plot at every turn. Then Tony Stark goes onto solve the time travel equation or whatever in about 10 seconds of screen time (I know he's a super genius but come on) and our heroes jump down the quantum tunnel to complete their time heist, which I'll admit is a pretty cool concept.",

Cinematically it was epic, spectacular, CGI filled superhero awesomeness but the film was slow to start (after a brilliant emotional first 15 mins) and I was mostly underwhelmed by the plot. I felt Thor was ruined by the joke and some parts were just cameos for the sake of it. I did sob with my son at the saddest part, but I still feel a bit... meh.... maybe I need to watch it again to see if it's better second time around!",
369,28 April 2019,helenrobinson-07127,6, Just not as great as I had hoped.,"This movie picks up after the devestating events of infinity War that wiped out half of all living creatures.
In this movie you can really feel a sense of urgency from the avengers. And the way the characters are taken is all very pleasing. The acting is some of the best in an avengers film. The 3 hour run time is not a problem what's ever and I could've happily sat watching it for 5 or even 6 hours without feeling it dragging on.",

We must move forward fearlessly, because we have no room for retreat. Retreat is compromise, we can only accept life that makes us uncomfortable. If the surviving superheroes don't go to kill me, can they? Of course, the world is not dead. Half of the people are still alive. The living good can rebuild their homes and the social system. The living bad can continue to do evil and do bad things. The living heroes only need to guard the rest of the world. It's not impossible. Just as we have chosen compromise and concession in our lives, a little less money and more work to accept the world.
