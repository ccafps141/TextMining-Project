0,27 June 2008,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, Honestly? This is the best Disney/Pixar movie I have seen,"I'm starting to wonder if there is bad Disney/Pixar film, I mean, normally when we think of the combo, it does equal gold, we automatically know that everyone is going to love this movie, it's just a matter of comparison to the other animation films. I'm not just saying this because I had a good time when I was watching this, I'm very serious, this is my favorite Disney/Pixar film. It's completely worth the ticket price, this couldn't have been a more perfect film. Everything about WALL·E is just beyond great: the characters, the story, and the incredible animation. But the thing that I loved about WALL·E is it's message, I know that it does go a little over board with the ""jog or get fat"", ""throw your garbage away"", and the ""we've become too dependent on machines"" message, but I felt this was the most charming way to present it to the children who have to grow up in a world where they're going to have to worry about global warming, this may open their eyes a little.",/
1,1 December 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9, Simply amazing!,"I heard mixed reviews on WALL-E, there were those who said it was magical, and those who said it was one of the most overrated movies ever. I will say I loved this movie, it is a truly beautiful movie. It could have done with being a tad longer perhaps, but essentially this is more than a movie with A List vocal talents, WALL-E has genuine heart and will definitely enchant children and any Pixar fan. All I will say is that I am sorry it took me such a long time to see it, I will admit I was differing whether I should see it or not. But I am glad I did. The animation is simply incredible, the whole film is wonderful to look at. The whole movie is done in a very sophisticated visual style, and the bright colours and sublime backgrounds were a delight to the eyes. The music is stunning, the orchestral themes are gorgeous but the song from Hello Dolly! was great and fitted in with the story well. Speaking of the story, it may seem thin to some, but it is a very simple heart warming one all the same with depth and poignancy. There are some very imaginative moments, such as the zero-gravity dance and the ride through space. The voice cast that includes Fred Willard, Sigourney Weaver and Pixar regular John Ratzenburger did an exceptional job, and all the characters were endearing. What made the movie was WALL-E himself, he has to be one of the most lovable and in-depth Pixar characters ever, and the writers create a very haunting atmosphere in the early scenes to match our little hero's isolation. All in all, brilliant, quite possibly one of the best films of 2008. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",r
2,5 July 2008,seaview1,9, WALL-E Brings Pathos to Computer Animation,"Pixar has produced some of the best animation in the past decade with its computer-generated features (Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo) that have been marked by strong story lines and vivid characters. The tradition continues in an impressive way with Wall-E. This deceptively simple tale is transformed by the emotional content told almost entirely through visuals. ",e

6,8 December 2008,claudio_carvalho,10, Wonderful Message,"In the Twentieth-Eighth Century, Earth is completely depleted and with the ecological system destroyed. The powerful corporation Buy N Large builds a huge spacecraft called Axiom and sends the entire civilization for a five-year cruise while trash collector robots called WALL-E (Waste Allocator Load Lifter  Earth) would clean the planet. However, the equipment fail and seven-hundred year later, only a single robot WALL-E is performing his duty. His only companion is a cockroach and his great entertainment is watching an old ""Hello Dolly"" videotape. When a spaceship lands on Earth out of the blue and leaves the probe Eve, WALL-E follows her and falls in love for Eve. After a hostile initial contact, the dangerous Eve gets close to WALL-E and he gives a small plant to her. Eve gets the plant and automatically sends a signal to the spaceship that returns and takes Eve back. However, the desperate WALL-E grabs on the hull and travels through the space chasing Eve until they reach Axiom and find a full automated facility crowded by lazy and fat human beings unable even of walking with their legs. The expectation of life on Earth brings hope to the Captain against the will and prime direction of the auto-pilot that organizes a mutiny on board.",w
7,29 June 2008,jedi-jones,10, An A+ for Wall-E! One of the best movies this century!,"Wall-E is the movie experience I've been looking for. I haven't seen a new film this richly entertaining, thrilling, touching and satisfying since Spider-Man 2. It is truly the finest Pixar or animated CGI film to date. I can discuss it without spoilers easily because it's one of those films, like 2001: A Space Odyssey, that exists more as a pure experience of the heart and the senses than as a collection of events that we're supposed to keep track of intellectually. Wall-E rises above that kind of unnecessary complication into the same kind of space occupied by dreams and the imagination.",/
8,25 June 2008,jaredmobarak,8, Define dancingWall-E,"Robots falling in love. There is a lot to like about the new Pixar film Wall-E. The animation goes without sayingbetter than anything out there. The glares, the environments, everything is rendered spectacularly, right down to the flame of a Zippo lighter. As for the story, leave it to these wizards for creating a tale that hits on a gut level, letting our simplest emotions come to the surface in order speak to our hearts and souls. With fewer words than Arnold Swartzenegger had to speak in Terminator 2, this movie relies on its visuals and on the movements and actions of the characters. It is appropriate that we are shown clips from older musicals to show humanity before Earth was abandoned. If we harken back to them for the joys of people, why not go to silent era style in order to portray communication between beings that cannot speak? Wall-E, his crush EVE, and all the other robots involved can say little than their name, however, we understand exactly what they mean throughout. The entire film speaks on a level that most people might have forgotten. In an age of Hollywood spoon-feeding the masses by having actors preach the obvious, Pixar has shown their originality again by getting an audience to partake in a film that makes them pay attention and work a little; something that the message of the piece is trying to have come across for humanity in general.",r
9,7 June 2008,CA_movie_fan,10, Pixar's still producing the best movies out there,"We went to the San Francisco Film Institute's first public screening at their campus in Emeryville. Everyone's sworn to secrecy, but for a film with little dialog, it carries more of an emotional punch and has a richer story than any live-action movie this year. The tone and style of the film is completely different for Pixar, and Disney haven't tried to override the darker thematic elements at all, making the story surprisingly three-dimensional.",w
10,27 June 2008,Valeen_the_II,10, Not just another Pixar masterpiece....A modern day SCI-FI masterpiece!,"This truly is one beautiful, touching animated sci-fi film....I cannot stress this enough. It's a unique cinema experience that you must enjoy firsthand.",1
11,26 June 2008,michael11391,10," WALL-E is one of the most cutest, lovable characters Pixar ever invented!!","Not only it's Pixar's best film of all-time but it's the best movie of this year and one of the greatest imaginative, visually, moving & excellent animated films in years and surprisingly, one of the best sci-fi movies since E.T.!! Coming with high expectations, it definitely succeeded mines. It's so beautiful, moving, hilarious & sad at the same time. And for those who has been anticipating Thomas Newman's score for WALL-E, it's certainly one of his best right behind Finding Nemo in which I thought was his best score to date! Like I said it's Pixar best film so far, WALL-E knocked off Ratatouille of the top spot in which I thought it was their best film to date and officially, WALL-E is the best Pixar film i've ever seen with Ratatouille right behind and Finding Nemo, third. Pixar fan or non-Pixar fan, you'll definitely enjoy this one. WALL-E will forever be remembered as one of the most lovable characters ever created on film!!!",9
12,17 June 2010,Rectangular_businessman,10, A masterpiece,"""Wall-E"" along with ""Up"" must be one of the best movies released by Pixar, a company that never made a single bad film: All were enjoyable and well made, a complete pleasure to watch. ""Wall-E"" not only have an incredible animation, but also the characters were simply adorable, likable and interesting, and the history was funny and charming form beginning to end, with lots of heartwarming moments and captivating scenes, beautifully made. The plot was brilliant: Most of films aimed to children have very simplistic or silly plots, but ""Wall-E"" has a deep, meaningful story that everyone from the public could appreciate, from the youngest members of the audience, to the most cynical adults. ""Wall-E"" is simply one of the best films ever made, and it's a film that deserves everyone's recognition. I don't think that it is overrated at all; actually I think that is pretty underrated, because this film don't have any single flaw.",0
13,29 August 2008,DICK STEEL,10, A Nutshell Review:,"In some strange twist of Fate, the local release of recent Pixar movies always had us here twiddling our thumbs wondering when it'll finally make its way to the screens, while we hear the accolades ring from the rest of the world in marvelling at the quality that Pixar continually churns out. It's likely that the distributors want to coincide the release with the local school holidays, but frankly, the money also comes from the adult crowd, as testament to this full house in one of the largest screens downtown during a late night screening with nary a noisy kid in tow.",1
14,23 June 2008,likeminded,8, The People At PIXAR are geniuses....,"Just got back from a special sneak peek/advance screening of this movie, and I must say, Pixar continues to amaze. They just can't seem to make a bad move. Heck, they can't even make a mediocre movie. Now, I will admit, there have been a couple that I would classify as my ""least favorite"" of theirs, but even they were actually very, very good. This one, though...it just may take the cake. Ranks up there with the absolute best they have produced. Hysterical, emotional, meaningful -- this movie succeeds on every front! I am not going to get into spoilers or specific plot aspects, but I will say that I am almost definitely going to see this one again in the theater..and it will be worth every dime. Come Friday, be in line to see Wall-E. You don't want to miss it!",3
15,30 May 2021,fernandoschiavi,8," Wall-E is flawless in every way. There is a strong and relevant message to be transmitted, combined with a visual of great impact and with absurdly captivating characters","The film starts in the year 2700, having as main scenario our planet, basically uninhabited. It presents itself as a large garbage dump, in which the main character of the film, Wall-e (Waste Allocation Load Lifters - Earth), works to compact and organize all this rubble, alone, since his professional companions are already spoiled. So he and his pet cockroach are the only inhabitants of that gray planet.",8
16,14 August 2009,Hitchcoc,9, Thoughtful and Kind,"I was skeptical when I heard that this was a movie about machines falling in love. This kind of thing has been done before and has left me cold. This movie, however, takes a character who has endured in his lot, a romantic robot at that, and gives him a chance to realize his dreams. He has learned about love from watching a dull old Disney-like musical. One of those forgettable things that children hated, but were frequently brought to by their parents. He has established himself a sentient being with a loving soul. One day a slick rocket ship drops a probe into his garbage infested landscape. It is a porcelain-like, egg shaped beauty with deadly capabilities needed for self-preservation. This critter is egg shaped, unlike Wall-e's dumpy presence. He falls in love with her (she is definitely quite feminine. Like all desperate males, he does what he can to impress her, almost at the expense of his existence. The other interesting aspect of this film is the human element. Humanity has devolved into fat, slovenly lumps, with no thoughts or ambitions. When Wall-e shows up in their spaceship, he throws a wrench into the works. This little commentary is inadequate. Mainly, I found the whole thing quite charming and the evolving love affair believable.",2
17,30 January 2009,kosmasp,10, They did it again,"Apart from Cars (which as I heard will get a sequel, surprisingly for me at least), every movie Pixar made until this point in time, was at least excellent, imho. And even Cars, was still pretty good, just never hit as high, as the other ones did. WALL-E is proof yet again, that there is only one true animation champ! ",/

25,10 July 2008,Buddy-51,8, visually astonishing but somewhat lacking in drama,"""Wall-E,"" the latest offering from the movie-making geniuses at Pixar Studios, is a certifiable visual masterpiece that provides an endlessly inventive vision of what life might be like in the 29th Century - although, come to think of it, the term ""life"" may be something of a misnomer, for in ""Wall-E""'s post-apocalyptic image of the future, Earth has been rendered uninhabitable by pollution and garbage that have risen to toxic levels. The humans have long since fled to a high-tech way station located somewhere out in the far reaches of outer space, leaving the planet virtually deserted except for a sweet trash-compressing robot named Wall-E and his indestructible cockroach sidekick. Like all good little robots, Wall-E tirelessly performs the one function he has been programmed to carry out, even after the reason for that task no longer exists. Thus, he spends his days dutifully collecting all the litter generously strewn about the deserted city and converting it into skyscraper-high mounds of compacted trash. At night, he wiles away the hours watching an old videotape of ""Hello Dolly"" and pining away for a female companion who will alleviate his loneliness and bring some meaning to his life. Then, one fine day, his dream becomes a reality when a sleek, sexy little number named Eve - actually an environmental robot sent from the way station to see if any signs of life have returned to the planet - shows up unexpectedly in Wall-E's neighborhood.",t
26,10 July 2008,socrates99,8, Brilliant beginning somewhat spoiled by the reality it alludes to,"I was ready to be wowed by this film and the first 20 minutes or so were ecstatic for me. Sometimes I think there's no comparison between Japanese anime and the stuff Hollywood puts out, but this was clearly inspired and ingenious film making that can hold its own against Japan's best. But then the film has trouble dealing with the problems it poses, not unlike how we're failing to deal with the REAL problems of over consumption and the mindless accumulation of waste that it alludes to. The setting changes and the story takes a rather depressing turn into frenetic activity that made me anxious to see it over. It's not that the film's point is misguided or even over sold. It's just that it's a different issue and not necessarily a consequence of the first more successfully contrived part. That second issue is our becoming overly serviced by robots in a blind pursuit of entertainment and sensation. Still, the creation of a robot with a completely engaging personality is so brilliant and indelible that no one should miss this somewhat mixed film. Clearly the people who made this have their head's on straight and have a better vision of what could result from our culture than some of our most highly respected leaders.",_

28,27 June 2008,TOMNEL,10, The most charming cartoon I've ever seen. Nearly perfect in every way!,"My favorite animated movie was, and still is The Nightmare Before Christmas, but Wall-E comes in at close second. Pixar outdid themselves in every possible way, and it seems that though they've done that with each of their films, this one stands above the others. It's cute, without those lame sappy moments that cause you to uncomfortably stare at the floor. It's emotional, with some scenes even leaving a lump in my throat. The animation is amazing and the story is both inventive and original (for the most part). Wall-E is the quintessential Pixar film...no, it's the quintessential animated movie.",r

Writer-Director Andrew Stanton has not only managed to create a technical marvel with Wall-E, pushing the boundaries of computer animation technology to the limits, but also a work of pure art that's more intelligent, heartfelt, thought provoking, and flat-out masterful than any movie in years.",v

31,30 June 2008,george.schmidt,10, Pixar scores with another masterpiece; one of the year's best films!,"WALL*E (2008) **** (Vocal/s/f/x provided by Ben Burtt; voices of: Elissa Knight, Jeff Garlin, John Ratzenberger, Kathy Najimy Sigourney Weaver; featuring Fred Willard) Pixar scores another instant classic and a bona fide animated masterpiece in this engagingly entertaining feat showcasing a lonely, fastidious refuse robot, Wall*E (sound editor Burtt providing the whimsical whirrs and woops) who comes across a sign of life in the future for Earth and the remote droid EVE (Knight) sent on an intergalactic mission back to the no-longer inhabitable planet to ascertain the data. Visually amazing and magical with many nods to sci-fi predecessors as varied as ""E.T."", ""AI"". ""2001"", and ""Alien"" (nice nod with Weaver as the voice of the ship's computer!) Heartwarming, funny and with a unique 'green message'  save the planet! One of the year's very best films. (Dir: Andrew Stanton, who collaborated on the screenplay with Jim Capobianco)",
32,28 June 2008,Quinoa1984,10," adorable and haunting, delightful, joyous, and ultimately funny","I never thought I'd say this but... WALL*E is better than Toy Story. This might not seem like such a high claim given how many other wonderful movies from PIXAR have come out over the past 13 years, particularly the ones by Brad Bird (Incredibles and Ratatouille). But since Toy Story blew open the front door for CGI animation, and stood as the pinnacle of awesome, great entertainment and film-making, I wasn't sure if anything could top it. WALL*E does by far, and then some; I'd even say that this is probably the best Disney movie that, technically, they never made. For years Disney, the studio joined at the hip (and now, practically, submissive to whatever PIXAR wants in animation), didn't want to do WALL*E, as it was a somewhat bleak science fiction movie with 3/4 of the movie not featuring any distinct human dialog at all. And, no cute animals talking either; the closest we get here is a cockroach, and, thankfully, we only get cute chirps and squees of joy.",
33,3 July 2008,ilikeimdb,7, Creative Vision with Predictable Plot = Not Entirely Satisfying,"The stunning virtual world of Wall.E shows Pixar at the top of their creative graphic powers. Going over the beautiful CGI in my head, I'm still in awe of how the designers portrayed Wall.E's integrated world and their attention to detail will serve as a benchmark for years. That said, I'm less impressed by the simple and very predictable plot. Pixar/Disney married state-of-the-art visuals with a worn plot line from an early childhood fairy tale.

38,28 June 2008,WikusVanDeMerwe,10, Rediscovering our Humanity: A Wall-E Review,"We live in a consumerist era. As any visit to a metropolitan area will prove, there is the unfaltering marriage of burgeoning commerce to a burgeoning population. Retail giants now provide services that would take more than a handful of independent stores to supply and this umbrella is continually widening. But how far can this consumerism go before it consumes us? This is where Wall-E begins, setting up the most scathing, yet perhaps most accurate futurist take on consumerism's affect on society in any animated film I've seen to date. In fact, I can't recall any film in the last several years that has taken this approach so seriously. Andrew Stanton once again throws us straight into a darkly themed film, but once again there are serious points to be had. At the outset of the film, we are introduced to a world where the skyscrapers that once housed the internal workings of business are dwarfed and surrounded by skyscrapers built of that very business' refuse. WALL-E spends his days continuously collecting and compacting the mountains of garbage that fill the streets of the city and adding it the trash skyscrapers, piece by piece. We learn very early on that this is the last functional bot of its kind, and perhaps, the only living machine on the planet. But there is something special about this surviving Wall-E; this robot performs its programmed tasks, but it has also become a curious being, collecting and organizing interesting items seen day by day. Wall-E is, essentially, the last bit of humanity left on Earth, since every other human being is either dead or living aboard the space cruise liner, the Axiom.",

41,2 October 2009,whatever_123,10," Thank you, Pixar!!","DO NOT listen to those who say this is a bad movie because there's hardly any dialog. Everything in this movie is so perfect, it doesn't NEED dialog!! The animation was so REAL. Everything was perfect!! The landscapes were beautiful, the technology was creative, smooth, and incredibly flawless, the robots were great! I thought it was interesting how real humans were used in small parts of the movie, and the humans in the future were animated, shown as really large, lazy people we may become in the future, if we're not careful. As soon as the movie started, I fell in love with Wall-e. He was possible the most adorable thing I have ever seen! His character was so deep, you could forget he's not human. Wall-e has the biggest heart of any of the characters I've seen. You have to be insane to not love Wall-e. I really enjoyed seeing the chemistry develop between EVE and Wall-e. They are so different, EVE being a fast, powerful, advanced robot, and Wall-e being a sweet, simple, rusty little trash-compacting robot, and they work together PERFECTLY!!! They are the cutest couple in Pixar history. The messages in the story were very well-presented. It showed what could happen to our planet if we trashed it and took it for granted and what could happen if we all get too lazy. The perfect combination of humor, CGI, heart, and lessons to be learned, this is truly a Pixar triumph.",
42,30 June 2008,ClaytonDavis,9," WALL-E, the most innovative animated film in years...","Animation is a key element in the lives of children but somewhere around adolescence, a young person feels they're ""too mature"" or ""too cool"" to be watching ""cartoons."" Then a change occurs in adulthood, which the same young person misses something from their childhood and a film they watched while playing with Lego's brings them back to that. As of late, animated films have tried to be something their not, perhaps lost their spark. In the new millennium, I haven't really experienced the Bambi, The Lion King, or The Fox and the Hound of our time. Finding Nemo and The Incredibles raised the bar but still hadn't been the perfect dose of entertainment, writing, and emotion. WALL-E, has achieved where its predecessors failed.",
43,2 January 2011,Tweekums,10, Another classic from Pixar,"Having enjoyed Pixar's 'Incredibles' and 'Toy Story' trilogy I was keen to see 'Wall-E' when it was on television. The reviews I'd heard suggested that I'd be in for a treat and they weren't wrong; Pixar may make films that are aimed at a younger audience but adults are unlikely to feel childish if they watch them; this is especially true of 'Wall-E'. Set in a distant future where the Earth has been abandoned by humanity because pollution and the build up of garbage has made the planet uninhabitable one small robot toils to tidy up the mess left behind; that robot is Wall-E. Throughout his days he crushes the rubbish into cubes then stacks them in towers that have come to dwarf the city's long abandoned skyscrapers. When he finds items he likes such as an old Rubik's Cube or a small weed he takes it back to his 'home' to store. His existence is changed one day when a spaceship arrives and drops off a shiny new robot who we later learn is called EVE; the two of them become friends and everything goes well for them until he shows her the plant, then she takes it, puts it inside her and shuts down. It appears that her mission was to search for plant life then wait to be retrieved. When this happens she is taken away on the space ship, not wanting to be without her Wall-E clings on and is taken back to the Axiom; the ship where what is left of humanity lives. The people aren't like people now though; they are all over-weight which is hardly surprising as they don't seem to get out of their hover chairs and are waited on by a variety of robots. Once here Wall-E and EVE's adventures are just beginning as they must avoid the security systems and deliver the plant to the scanner which the ships autopilot is determined to stop them doing as it had been informed that Earth would never be suitable for resettlement.",
44,20 July 2008,theskulI42,9, Glorious animation with heart outclasses everything this year.,"From Curious George to E.T. and right on down to the present day, cinema-goers have always had a strong affinity towards, for lack of a better term, ""curious little critters"", small animals, aliens or other beings who are simultaneously inquisitive and clueless about the ways of Earth, and are preferably also quite clumsy, and Wall-E, as a character and as a movie, delivers in spades. Taking a pratfall as effortlessly as Keaton, and doing a terrified double take better than the most racist of cinema servitude, the sentient being, whose job it is to pick up and compact trash on a desolate future Earth, is equally fascinated by the inner workings of lightbulbs, Twinkies, garbage can lids and iPods, but can't seem to cover his head, as countless manner of things continually seem to be crashing down upon it.

There is no dialogue for the first half hour or so, but that's why those scenes are strong, emotional, and maybe even more powerful than those containing words (e.g. When Wall E initially finds certain things among the trash). I found links to the 2001 Odyssey that were deliberately placed like the first half hour of a movie, the main robot in a spaceship, or music near the end. Not only is this a great cartoon for kids but it is also a great SF that adults can enjoy as well. It didn't lose anything when I watched it again, in fact it may be even better.

I'm an unabashed Pixar fan, and have been since Toy Story 2, but I was a little disappointed in their last two films, Cars and Ratatouille. Both were good, very good at times, but I don't think they hit the level of what came before. To me, WALL-E is a return to form. No, that's too weak. It's their peak. No, that's wrong, too. A ""peak"" implies that they're about to go down. I doubt that's true, although it's going to be hard to beat this one. WALL-E is my favorite of the Pixar films so far because I think it goes past the point of merely fantastic to that of being transcendent. It's a truly visionary film, one that inspired my jaw to drop over and over again. And it's intimate, too. It's hard to believe, but you're going to fall in love with a couple of robots when you watch the movie. And it's incredibly smart, too. Pixar has actually had this vein in most if not all of their movies, where they deliver moral lessons without any pandering whatsoever. The movie also contains deft social commentary. It's a pure joy to watch, and, without a doubt, one of the all-time great animated movies. Thank God for Pixar.",

I remember very well when I went to cinema to see it with my school, is one of the few good memories I have from the years in junior high school.

70,4 September 2008,Alise_shenle,10, A Convenient Truth,"Wall E is the most excellent, thought provoking film there is since SpiderMan's (with great power comes great responsibility). It gives us the haunting truth about the 'utopia' life we'll have, if we don't do something NOW to conserve this wonderful planet, to stop pollution. Using actions instead of words, Wall E continues to do his duty though he is the only one left. He is also very humane, caring for the cockroach, and very friendly towards Eve, though she tried to kill him many times at first. He would also sacrifice himself for Earth, and he nearly died. Wall E might tremble at the sight of a spaceship, but he is incredibly brave in rescuing Eve and the shoot. The scene with the couple singing and holding hands really strikes a chord into our hearts. He might be outdated as a robot, but he would do anything to save Earth. Eve was at first a cold robot, but after Wall E touches her, she became more interesting, especially when she thought Wall E had forgotten her, she looked so crushed. She was also cool as a flying supergirlfriend. Also, though she likes to laser many things, she is nice to the cockroach too. The captain is a nice guy, he is willing to do what many generations ahead of him had opted for the easy way, face the damage of earth and do his best, because THIS IS OUR HOME!! He'd rather do the right thing than the easy thing. GO! The idea of humans becoming lazy and dependent on robots is frightening. We would only care about ourselves and dump Earth. Maybe dump the spaceship too if it's got too much trash. I hope we will not end up like this!! Can't even stand, or turn over, relying on a robot and chair. Wall E is great!

It is truly a film for all ages and audiences that dazzles the eye and takes your breath away. The attention to detail is awesome which makes the slower pace of the first act of the film absolutely mesmerizing. And that is the key to Wall-E. While the storyline is trimmed down to razor tight telling (that is, not wasting time on what is not essential to the story and themes), it feels open and relaxing. Some of the best moments come when Eve and Wall-e simply fly together or gaze on the stars. The conflict in the movie grabs ahold of you and pulls at your heart strings while leaving a sense of wonder in you. That's because there is a sense of hope and love that permeates the story; exactly what you expect from a film primarily targeted for children. But adults will relate to because of the depth of the storytelling. Andrew Stanton and crew should feel great about what they have made here. It is not only good sci-fi and good animation, but it rejuvenates you while you watch it. My 4 and 3 year old absolutely love this movie and so do my wife and I. Don't miss it!",

At the heart of this film is a love story between Wall-E and a more advanced robot named Eve. The writers did a great job of fleshing out the character of Wall-E whose in it for the majority of the movie. You care about the lonely robot because all he wants more than anything is a friend. This movie has a little something in it for everyone humor, some action, drama, character development, and a touching love story. I was very impressed with this film and I can see why after seeing Wall-E why may critics and audiences mostly kids really liked this one. The film was a little slow in the beginning but the rest made up for it's one flaw. Overall Wall-E has humor, some action, great special effects, romance, and well developed characters you come to care about. So if you're looking for a good movie to watch with your kids.

Of course the setting can be changed along the situations and characters, but I am hinting more towards the target audience. Firstly, there is the option to skew the demographic strongly towards the fledgling crowd with films like Curious George and The Wild. Close behind are those films targeted at a younger, but not greatly adolescent audience, which are embodied in films like Madagascar and Horton Hears a Who! The detrimental aspect of films like these, are that they are for the most part strictly kid-fare, and may put off the unwilling parents, especially after DVD combusts after overuse. Next there is the more risky segment of animated films, in which the creators strive to link the generational gorge and give pleasure on a surplus level. Films like Shrek, The Incredibles and Finding Nemo have been successful at this, but a greater number like Happy Feat, Igor, Barnyard, Monster House and Open Season have been less so. Finally, there lies the risk at the other end of the spectrum, in creating films that may be too mature for less seasoned patrons to understand or keep interested in, such as Ratatouille and The Iron Giant.",

Though, I can't see much to improve on. The story, the character development, the special-effects, the comedy and the message are all top-notch. In fact, this is just another work of art/cinema. As a science-fiction/space adventure, it actually leaves a lot of the live-action movies in the space dust. This one, despite the computer animation, is so incredibly realistic; I thought I was watching real-life scenes. And the best news yet: it's never about the F/X. It's about the story – the essence I always look for when deciding to buy a movie ticket. We live in an era that gives us 'Transformers' (or part 2) that gives us NO SOUL, or script, and we follow along like we're shopping at Wal-mart, sorry, I mean ""Buy'N'Large."" I can't rate a movie that doesn't excel on plot/story/originality. Wall-E does that. He's a compact little machine that's directive is to clean up the mess of a world we made 700 years from now. Until he meets a probe, Eve, that's sent to look for signs of life. Ironically, her mission, or being, in turn gives him life and on goes the adventure when he follows her into space to meet the human (and robot) survivors ready to return once Earth's inhabitable again. In a word, this movie's a masterpiece. Finally, a movie void of almost complete dialogue, you rely on body language and silent love. Rarely does a look show love in movies. In fact, for the most part, we're shoved love down our throats by words. Hardly is it shown with true love. Strangely, we have to turn to robots to open our eyes. Do not miss this movie.",
98,29 June 2008,moutonbear25,9, Out of this World,"To be animated can mean a number of things. While it obviously refers to the artistic process in which still images are strewn together in sequences to appear as though they are moving, it can also mean to bring someone or something to life. Pixar Animation Studios are masters of both of these animated meanings and their genius lies in their seemingly effortless ability to accomplish both of these feats simultaneously. In the studio's history, they have managed to make toys playful when no one else was looking, the plight of a bunch of ants seem monumental and rats in the kitchen somehow not only normal but entirely justifiable. Despite all of these milestones, Pixar has outdone themselves with their ninth feature, WALLE. It might be unfair to suggest that no other company could accomplish this but there is certainly no other company that could have done as good a job. WALLE is short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class and the character himself is a collapsible box with curiously wide eyes that gets around on tank treads and solar power. He may be made up of nothing but rusting metal and parts that need frequent replacing but he is also the most endearing, romantic dreamer that Pixar has ever crafted. You just want to squeeze the little guy. Trust me; the tetanus shot you'd need after that would be totally worth it.",
99,20 June 2011,paul2001sw-1,9, A glimpse of the future,"I quite like some of Pixar's films, but I tend to feel that they're somewhat overpraised, and there's certainly a theme linking their protagonists, who have variously been cute talking toys, cute talking insects, cute talking monsters, cute talking fish, and cute talking cars. Prior to watching I didn't have that much anticipation for 'WALL-E', about a (presumably cute talking) robot - but how wrong I was. The robot doesn't talk for a start, and the film has the most extraordinary animation I have seen, notably for its inventiveness, attention to detail and sheer beauty. Indeed, many of the scenes have a balletic grace, with obvious nods to 2001 but also (especially in the first half of the film, where there's barely a word of dialogue), to the silent movie era (was I the only one reminded of Chaplin's skating scene in 'Modern Times' by some of the choreography?) Throw in a truly eerie and disturbing portrait of a post-habitable earth in which even (almost all) the robots have died out, and an opposing dystopia of a space ark where humanity survives in total comfort and zero dignity, and you have many of the elements in place of a classic film. Perhaps inevitably, the second half (while still good) is more like a traditional Pixar movie, the story of the triumph of the underdog and the audacity of hope; yet the overall tone of the movie is such, that when the ending threatens to be very sad, you have no idea whether there will be a final happy twist or it will leave you in tears. Until now, even when I've liked good animations, I've scoffed at those who argue they rival the best ""real"" films - but 'WALL-E' is a genuine artistic achievement, and wholly deserving of its praise.",

101,4 June 2021,haydendeepsy,10, A robot alone on Earth,"What can one say about this movie that hasn't already been said? That it's a masterpiece? That, along with any other praise has already been given to Pixar's truly greatest achievement. WALL-E is the only Waste Allocation Load Lifter left on Earth. He, along with many other units where created by the company BnL, in an attempt to clean the mess of trash on Earth, while the humans would take a 5 year cruise on the Axiom spaceship and await the result, without having to face the consequences of their actions on their home Planet. 700 years later, Our WALL-E is the only one still functioning, and is now the only inhabitant of the planet, as there has been no news in regards to the humans. The fact that WALL-E is presented to us with such a human personality, other than building empathy for the character, works in a sense that having lived alone on the planet for so long, he started to understand it and see it with curiosity, a primary human emotion, while still serving his purpose of waste allocator. Onother great personality trait is that of EVE, who before encountering WALL-E, was but one of many Extrterrestrial Vegetation Evaluators, but after receiving a different form of attention, it started to express it's emotions in a different way. For example, when she first arrives and begins her search for biological life, she has a very robotic approach to it, but as she starts to receive a new type of attention, she begins to feel more human like when she can't find what she is looking for, getting frustrated and vocally expressing it. That which happened to EVE, also happened to all other robots on the ship, who altogether where a perfect system, but when an outsider came into the mix, the system didn't work anymore. An example of that are the ""roads"", that the humans aboard and robots use to move. As soon as WALL-E steps into it, he causes the probably first collision to have ever happened. The great developmental trait in regards to the Captain, and the two people WALL-E has an encounter with, is that no matter how much the human body has changed, how ignorant they are about their past, and how much they now rely on technology, all that doesn't extinguish the prime human emotion: Curiosity. It is that which brings the human protagonists to regain themselves as humans. Another non accidental detail, is the resemblance between the Autopilot and HAL-9000 of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey. They are both fundamental pieces of the ships they are built into, and have very similar personality traits: when HAL felt threatened buy the fact that the protagonists where having a conversation of him behind his back, he reacted in a very animalistic way, by trying to eliminate the threat, and when he faced his potential demise, he had a very human like reaction to it, almost as if he was feeling pain. The Autopilot reacted very similarly when he could not close the output where WALL-E would have had to place the plant, in order to put the ship en route towards Earth. He smashed the button in anger, as if it would have helped more than just pushing it. There are really no flaws in WALL-E, it is sufficiently drammatic, comical, intense and is just the right length. The animation is a thing of beauty, as are the characters, the story and the designs of the robots. Even without considering the many other meaningful themes in the story and characters, WALL-E remains to this day, and will for a long time hold it's place as one of the Giants of Cinema.",
102,3 July 2008,bobsgrock,9, Pixar never ceases to amaze me.,"It all started back in 1995. I was only 6 years old, but I was forever changed when I first saw Toy Story. Today, it is one of my favorite movies as well as a breakthrough for all animated movies. Now, 13 years later, Pixar is still going at it. After all these years, I can honestly say they have never made a bad movie, and they have also made some really excellent movies that in the future will be absolute classics (Toy Story, The Incredibles, Ratatouille). Wall-E is undoubtedly the most ambitious task they have undertaken to date with a serious lack of dialogue and a story that has universal appeal. For the first half hour, the only sounds heard are those made by the robots. Yet, the story moves along just fine and it is quite easy to understand what is going on. This is due to the incredible storytelling ability by the Pixar team as well as the extraordinary animation you cannot look away from. Seriously, you will wonder if some shots are shot with a real camera they are so clear and beautiful. With robots being the main characters, it is a bit more difficult for the audience to relate to them, but director Andrew Stanton does a perfect job of personifying them as well as making them very likable. The romance between Wall E and EVE is very cheesy, but so well done you can't help but smile. Be aware, this movie is not just for children. Adults will be amazed by the animation as well as the thought-provoking themes brought up about the future and just how much humans should rely on technology. Elements of 2001 and I Am Legend aside, this is one of the top 5 Pixar movies and definitely one of the best movies of 2008.",
103,15 January 2009,Robert_duder,9, An artistic feat of Animation that will become an absolute legendary classic!!,"I wanted to see Wall-E from the minute I saw the trailers. I thought he looked adorable and the film looked cute and then the reviews said it was kind of dark and very little dialog and finally I got to see it. I was moved, blown away, excited by it, cheering for it...I fell head over heels for Wall-E and it's completely original and touching love story. Essentially I believe Wall-E is indeed a love story...both between two completely different robot entities and between a robot and his world. The animation is brilliant from the completely obliterated world of earth to the enormous futuristic ship and the adventure is non stop fun!! Despite some reviewers opinions of the film being too dark and too preachy for kids I think its a case of over analyzing because the film is fun and cute as it is serious. Yes the film does have a strong message but it is still told in animation for anyone and everyone to enjoy and the story is still happily ever after in the end. The amazing thing is the film makers really make this relationship between Wall-E and Eve so strong and so powerful and so cute that you will feel a romance between two robots. Something only Disney could do...or Pixar in this case.",

116,21 June 2010,moonspinner55,7, Jam-packed with plot and viewer-friendly ecology-minded messages...perhaps too jammed,"Disney/Pixar animation at its most beautiful, but also at its most annoying. In Earth's distant future, trash and refuse has replaced all life on the planet; a waste-reclamation robot (with human emotions and feelings) has a daily routine of condensing and piling up the junk-cubes into skyscrapers made of garbage. WALL·E is an amusing, resourceful, lovable hunk of metal and rubber who is also something of a happy hoarder (his collection includes Christmas lights, utensils, a cigarette lighter, a video-cassette of ""Hello, Dolly!"" and, most importantly, a small plant still encased in dirt). Director Andrew Stanton also co-wrote the screenplay with Jim Reardon (based on Stanton and Pete Docter's idea), and they have fashioned a mind-blowing, heart-tugging first act. WALL·E, whose only friend is a winsome little cockroach (!), is visited one day by EVE, an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, who inadvertently leads (and lifts) WALL·E off the Earth and into the galaxy (the film's peak moment) where he discovers obese, computer and soda-addicted humans living on a space station. This is arguably the moment where the movie begins losing some of its heart; Stanton shoots-up on the imaginative possibilities of the circumstance, revving the pace and sending the editing into overdrive (possibly to compensate?). There's a revolt of man-serving machines, a Captains' mutiny with the main power source, comedic elements derived from various popular films, and WALL·E's desire to be reunited with EVE (which is all we really care about). The film goes out of its way to engage younger viewers by immersing itself in cute behavior, cute responses and one-liners, and manic action-action-action. Cuteness is a prerequisite for Disney/Pixar, of course, but Stanton really lays it on thick delivering several false endings, all manipulated for that ultimate sentimental sock. Pixar Goes Green!

There is something essential, fundamental, stimulating about a movie without any dialogue for its first half: It is telling its story with, guess what, images! And what magnificent images they are. They have centuries of history to them, centuries in our future. Long, long before the film opens, a megacorporation, perfectly named Buy n Large, assumed every economic use in the world, including the government, as one would think of course inevitable. Filled by unrecycled waste, the planet has been so polluted that for seven hundred years, life has been unsustainable. In an attempt to keep humanity alive, the Buy n Large CEO, played in live action on a 700-year-old city screen by Fred Willard, sponsored a five- year exodus from Earth aboard a fleet of starliners that would support every need with a robot crew. Hundreds of thousands of waste-disposal robots were left behind to clean up the planet by compacting the trash into cubes and stacking them into skyscraper-like towers for easy disposal. However, this plan was rejected when Forthright determined that Earth was too contaminated for return to ever be possible. Now, only one of these robots remains operational.

What Stanton has created with Wall-E is not simply a motion picture, it's an experience and a story that will live as long as Homer's The Odyssey, William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet and J.M.

159,30 June 2008,meeza,10," Woweeee for ""Wall-E""","""Wall-E"" is ""by far out"" the best Pixar computer-animated film ever assembled. OK, it might sound fishy to you that I am selecting ""Wall-E"" over ""Finding Nemo"". You might think I am a rat in the kitchen by selecting ""Wall-E"" over ""Ratatouille"". You might think I am toying with you by selecting ""Wall-E"" over ""Toy Story 1 & 2"". You might think that I am incredibly deranged by selecting ""Wall-E"" over ""The Incredibles"". And you might think it is monstrous of me to select ""Wall-E"" over ""Monsters, Inc"". All the aforementioned are obviously credible computer-animated Pixar creations, but none of them captured the intellectual seismic force of ""Wall-E"". This earth trash shattering robot is definitely the most appealing character graphically drawn up by the Pixars. ""Wall-E"" stands for ""Waiting Amazingly Long Lines- Exasperatedly"", No! It actually stands for ""Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class"". Wall-E is a small waste collecting robot who is in a solitude futuristic earth with just a tiny pet cockroach to keep him company. However, Wall-E is not a total waste because he is very ingenious in doing the garbage work in a very compacting and useful manner. Wall-E is primarily a love robot who craves for the robotic touch of a Mrs. Roboto. Before you can say ""Hello Dolly"" (which is the film Wall-E constantly sees in his trashy apartment, lol) he falls for a female robotette named Eve which has traveled to earth to evaluate living organisms. Wall-E and Eve fall in love and then Wall-E eats a devilish apple which then (Wait! Wrong Eve story here). OK, here we go: Wall-E eventually follows Eve into a grandeur spaceship which takes him out of the earth-lands. In the second chapter of ""Wall-E"", the film turns into an insightful environmental lesson on the futuristic fate of our universe via Wall-E's hilarious, passionate, romantic, generous, and heroic ""space cadet"" spaceship adventures. Director Andrew Stanton brilliantly provides homage to Stanley Kubrick's classic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" by inserting elements of the Odyssey into ""Wall-E""; i.e. Blue Danube space, a similar HAL villain, the fate of mankind, etc. Somewhere in ""Stanton Island"" there is a Stanley Kubrick Memorial! There is not much dialogue in ""Wall-E"", but I must verbalize that it was the way to go in the ""Wall-E"" tale since it is Stanton's marvelous directorial orchestration that is the primary presentation tool of ""Wall-E"". It would be a waste if Stanton is not nominated for a Best Director Oscar nomination! ""Wall-E"" is the love guru that you should really be watching this summer! ""Wall-E"" will not be a waste of your time! One of the best films of 2008! I am not being off the wall when I say that ""Wall-E"" is so far one of the best films of 2008!

Pixar is already known for providing something different with each film, but this one goes beyond all others in its scope and tone. It works on many levels, that of a children's' film, a unique love story, as well as an sci-fi epic. Ben Burtt did wonders with the sound and yet these mostly silent characters are more involving and moving than any animated film's I've seen in along, long, time. The animation is visually stunning to say the least, and every shot is done beautifully. It's done with an artistic style that future films will struggle to even come close to.",
162,16 December 2020,mfellipecampos,10, Masterpiece,"The objective of this work is to analyze and discuss the dialogues that the film Wall-E (2008) allows for the understanding of the Marxist Theory of Critical Environmental Education. Animation is an important medium that works as a window to reality, so that people can see, in a playful way, the things that surround them, so that in this way they reflect on the daily problems related to their social practices. Cinema is the seventh artistic expression, characterized by moving images with the use of techniques and visual effects. But cinema is not just the movement of images through a projector, it involves a complex ritual of different elements and processes that include: production, distribution, investment, advertising, taste, among many other social relationships (BERNARDET, 1980). And, in addition to capturing people's attention with its aesthetic language, cinema can mobilize, in a playful way, relevant issues of daily life and beyond. However, the cinema constitutes a social process, and as such it has political, ideological and economic influences, with that, it is necessary a mediation, theoretically based, so that it can be a critical and reflective medium in fact. Therefore, the Marxist Theory of Critical Environmental Education allows the individual to identify himself as an integral part of nature, so that he is able to perceive and value the environmental and socio-cultural diversity, so that they can adopt coherent attitudes within their community (LOUREIRO, TOZONI-REIS, 2005). In addition, it points to the need to build active citizenship, in which people participate in the processes of social transformation and constitute new paradigms that consolidate a more just and environmentally healthy society (CICONELLO, 2008). The 98-minute animated Wall-E, directed by Andrew Stanton, from Disney and Pixar Studios, takes place in a dystopian future in which planet Earth is uninhabited due to the extreme deterioration of the environmental conditions that humans have been exposed to. responsible, due to exploitation and excessive consumption and the consequent production of waste, affecting the release of toxic gases into the atmosphere, the contamination of soil and river resources, making life on Earth impossible. In this way, the robot Wall-E, and others like it, were responsible for cleaning the planet while humans are on a kind of space cruise. However, the recovery plan fails and Wall-E, the last of its model, continues to carry out its work, until one day a ship with a robot from another model, called EVA, appears unexpectedly, which Wall-E falls in love and will take him to the space cruise, which will lead to several situations. Given this, it is intended, through Qualitative Research, to analyze the film in question. Such research is concerned with the process and the scenario to which it will relate, being more concerned with the process than with the final product, thus differing from quantitative research, as the researcher intends to understand how the problem manifests itself in social interactions ( MINAYO et al. 2016). In this perspective, the film was analyzed from two axes, the first of which concerns the issue of garbage, in which the story consists of a metaphor for the consequences of excessive production of it on Earth by human beings. In this way, it is in line with a trend in environmental conservation education that only focuses on awareness and behavioral issues that aim to individualize solutions, that is, the resolution of environmental problems in this trend will take place through individual actions (ADAMS, 2005 ). However, in Critical Environmental Education, the solutions are collective, mainly concerning the productive system of today's society. The second axis refers to a great contradiction that the film presents, due to the fact that social, economic and political issues are not addressed, suggesting that they are resolved. However, it is worth noting that both the issues of excess waste and excessive consumption are linked to social, economic, political and ideological issues, among others. Such questions support the capitalist system of opposition between classes that are maintained from the exploitation of the working class by the dominant class (LEFF, 2001). In this way, the film, even though it presents a dystopia that occurs from a real problem, solves and ignores the question of class struggle, showing itself, therefore, idealistic. Thus, the film is an important means of debating environmental issues, based on their potential, but also on their deficiencies, aiming at the formation of critical and reflective citizens who act actively in society.",

Wall·E has been described as 2001:A Space Odyssey for all audiences, I agree. They share many similarities such as the lack of dialogue and the breath taking visuals. Furthermore, the story near the end is resembles the man vs machine storyline that was present in 2001: A Space Odyssey with the HAL situation. Not only that, the AUTO looks EXACTLY like HAL.

171,6 July 2008,come2whereimfrom,9, A true Pixar classic.,"Well I've just been lucky enough to go to a preview screening of 'Wall-E' and all I can say is its brilliant and simply one of the best films in Pixar's ever expanding cannon. Director Andrew Stanton whose previous film was another Pixar classic 'Finding Nemo' has excelled beyond anything we could have expected and here everything works perfectly. The animation is pristine and I'm sure sharper than the human eye can actually see, the score fits and flows with the story and the sound done by Ben Burtt (think all the weird noises from Star Wars) is crisp, clear and beautiful. Like any good Pixar film and any kids film worth its weight it works on many levels allowing the more grown up amongst us to laugh along with the younger audience and laugh you can as the practically dialogue free film sees Wall-E himself as a kid of robot Chaplin with each slapstick visual timed to a tee. A lot of this relies on the design of Wall-E a kind of cross between 'Short Circuits' Johnny five and 'The Black Holes' V.I.N.C.E.N.T. and the fact that he is so aesthetically pleasing while also being able to be so animated is part of the overall charm. The story a simple boy meets girl or should I say robot meets robot has been done to death but here seems to dazzle with a new lease of life and my only criticism of the movie is that at times the whole moral message of recycling, looking after the planet etc is a little shoved down your throat and I know it's the zeitgeist of the moment but I wanted to be entertained not bummed out. Elsewhere there are great pastiches to '2001' and 'Close encounters', the misfit robots are hilarious and never have fat people been so funny. Wall-E has everything you could want; it looks good, sounds good, is very funny and has all the magic you have come to expect from the boys at Pixar. Not only is Wall-E a great film it is as close to a perfect movie as you could hope to get. A big triumph for a little robot.",
172,4 July 2008,ymghali,10, cry of warning,"Stupendous. although my comment says there might be spoilers, I'll minimize talking about the events of the movie to the extent that helps prove my point of view. Pixar takes us through the short cartoon at the beginning that smartly relaxes the audience and puts them in the right mood, to a stunningly well-animated well-woven story where machines have feelings and humans have been automated. It can be described as a ""cry of warning"" about the currents human and political condition of the world. In his efforts to anticipate everything and protect life, Man has forgotten the basic principles of logic and even instincts. The political dimension isn't absented as there is a character that leaves very little room to maneuver in guessing who it is, or what it represents (let the auto pilot take over). On the other hand, a robot follows his instincts and finds a love so great that it can save humanity. Beautifully illustrated, the facial expressions and animations are amazingly illustrated, the E voices are so full of emotions that they surpass all ex-Pixar films and leave no doubt that they are The Masters.

I go to the theater about three times a year at most--I end up renting most films from the shop because I don't like being pummeled with the noise that seems necessary on the big screen because people will not stop yakking away at the theatre.

Ironically, it is through the people's desire/curiosity to return our home planet that the audience begins to learn and appreciate the value of our Mother Earth.

It has also a brave opening for an animated movie because of the lack of dialogues in the first 20-30 minutes. But then as the setting changes I feel that the movie becomes a little too childish. Clearly this movie is intended for children but in other Pixar films this aspect was more balanced. Except for that the Wall-E is very enjoyable and it has also some references to very important pictures like 2001: Space Odissey and Star Wars and I'm sure I've missed some other more.

To begin with, Disney might have gotten Sony Pictures approval for their mimic of one of my favorite movies' character ""Number 5"" in the movie called 'Short Circuit'. Well, I loved this animated movie because of the character ""Wall-E"" and ""Eva"". Very well done animation and voices. The concept or movie plot was silly, but it worked for me. Simple, yet sweet. I'm not sure if it's an 8 Star, but it could be close. It would have had to have a way better plot or a sweeter lesson for today's youth which are the adults of our future. We need to emphasize more health in our movies and not mimic the current state/route of our countries' population in terms of obesity. I wish the movie industry well-being! Watch this movie at least once if you can.",

When a film or any piece of art leaves an ultimate stamp on your psyche, you can't help but smile with nostalgia and euphoric abandon. WALL-E achieves all that and more. With little to no dialog, the movie holds its own; even against ""Kung Fu Panda, and that's a film coming from Dreamworks of all things. Audiences will find a lot to love about this ingenious and charismatic robotic character with all his perks, quirks, mannerisms, all in a semi-realistic/sci-fi setting. I'm not a huge fan of CGI animated features but this one captivated me not because of it's originality, but also because the main character is a robot which most people have trouble sympathizing with, mainly because they're used to so many animated animals and people (though there are some humans in WALL-E). But the human characters don't overshadow the experience at all. Simply put a great film with terrific character development and a story so heartfelt and engrossing I'm sure it will make tons of money at the box office.",

From the beginning of the film to the end I felt everything was so deliciously perfect, I was struggling hold in my tears. When something is as outstanding as this film turned out to be, I tend to be a crybaby. I just can't help it. When something so ingenious finds its way to the silver screen, I see it as a big victory. Having to live with all the garbage that's being produced in Hollywood, it's almost worth it, when something so beautiful contrasts to it and makes you think about what storytelling is all about. This movie had a strong influence on me, one that I've not felt since I saw the Mexican film, Voces Inocentes (which I highly recommend by the way). Why was it that good?

that much more amazing and realistic. The humans are really good, too, while not realistic in the sense of you seeing it right now in real life, but they do have a realistic feel to them.

Alone on a near-lifeless Earth centuries after the evacuation of the human race, a lone garbage robot, the last of his kind, obediently continues to carry out his duties, compacting rubbish into solid cubes and piling them into lofty buildings. The sky is brown and dusty, smothered by the detritus of Mankind's wastefulness, and the garbage cities are often bombarded by stinging dirt storms that ravage the filthy landscape. But, thanks to WALLE (an acronym for ""Waste Allocation Load Lifter  Earth-class""), there is still life to be found on our planet's barren remains. As he goes about his day, our delightful little hero picks up any odd item that happens to catch his eye  a Rubik's cube, a plastic ""spork"", a light bulb, and, dearest to his heart, a battered VHS tape of Gene Kelly's 'Hello, Dolly!

232,7 July 2008,blanbrn,8, Well done. Nice and clever work again from Pixar. Marvelous feature.,"I for one have never been a big fan of animation or cartoon type films, yet something just interested me about ""WALL-E"" it just seemed like a nice and cute touching tale of a lonely moving robot about to start his journey thru the planet. I must say after seeing it that I wasn't letdown either overall it was pretty impressive work everything from graphics to the style of it's story with the fantasy characters living in cool settings. Starting in a rusty desert of junk where the only living thing that moves is square robot ""WALL-E"" who has such catchy and droopy binocular eyes. Much of the first parts of the film we see the robot as stubborn and alone as the action and journey of discovery doesn't really take off till he meets up with a landed spaceship and another ray eyed robot ""EVE"". This movie is clearly a film of discovery a new type of journey that involves future themes of space and saving humans with the central hero being a robot a lifelike possibility with the technology of the future as machines and droids may soon rule the planet.

It didn't answer any questions about what living in solitude is like, despite its more mature content. Pixar, however, has created Wall-E to satiate our boundless post-apocalyptic questions while still containing the action sequences of I am Legend. It's an adventurous work for Pixar, as the studio has not released a science fiction film or a film with mute (or mostly mute) protagonists. Fortunately for Pixar, their effort has created a beautiful film that is more adult-oriented than their previous eight works.",

I'm having a very hard time ranking these Pixar films, since I've got like a 4 way tie between Cars, Monsters, Inc., Ratatouille, and this one. This is possibly Pixar's most visually stunning films along with Coco, which gives it a lot of points. A good word to use to describe this is magical. It's crazy how much BETTER Pixar is than EVERY OTHER ANIMATION COMPANY by a country mile. A solid 9.0/10 for me is an amazing score and probably gets into my Top 100, and I've given out like 7 of them for the first 9 Pixar films. They're just that good.

You immediately establish an emotional connection to Wall-E and the entire environment. Machines are at the center. There you have difficulties to show facial expressions and gestures as extensively as with humans. But this movie succeeds in doing that.
Very little is spoken throughout the movie, but that doesn't affect the valence. The movie is not boring, nor do you feel like you lose information or you don't understand the overall plot or actions. The movie works a lot with the images shown and the soundtrack.
Wall-E respectively the mankind is on an odyssey in which the future way of life is in the center. In the process, they go through a new beginning and do a developmental step in evolution. '2001: A Space Odyssey' prepared for a different audience.",

The Film's background colours are brown and grey, with brown skies. Wall-e does clear up and recycle all rubbish, but he will not be there to clear up after us. The colours only brighten up when we are taken aboard the sterile conditions of the Axion spaceship, and we meet the clean bot who says ""Forgien Contaminant"" and cleans it up. Unfortunately all of us, who migrated into space aboard the spaceship, have become fat and lazy. I like Eve and I think that she is sleek and very modern looking, I cannot blame Wall-e for becoming smitten with her! I also think that it was a good idea to reestablish B'N'L at the spaceship, I also do not mind having my meals brought to my chair. If I where on that spaceship, I would help the captain with the controls, instead of that George the auto pilot. I have got the music CD and the tunes are brilliant. I hope that when they release the DVD, they include the sketch with the magician and the hungry rabbit and the trouble he went through to get his carrot.

242,9 July 2008,swlabr413,10, The Best Pixar Film,"When I first heard that there would be little to no actual dialogue in the first 40 minutes of Wall-E, I was skeptical. But then I remembered what is considered the greatest Science Fiction movie of all time (and as a matter of fact, AFI just named it that), 2001: A Space Odyssey. That also had almost no dialogue for the first 40 minutes. So my opinion changed and my view of the movie changed. I thought that Pixar was going to take a risk by doing this, and leave behind the typical kids movie. And the movie itself is not a typical kids movie. It passes as a very good Science Fiction movie as well as an animation movie because it gives us a scary look into the future, but done in a humorous way. Buy n' Large, which is obviously supposed to be Wal-Mart, takes over Earth in every way, economy and government. Soon, because they pollute the Earth so much, they have to send the human race out to space, and they'll have robots clean it up. Enter the title character. Wall-E is the last of his kind, and because he's been alone for so long, he develops a personality, collecting the trash and bringing them to his home. Soon Eve comes, and becomes Wall-E's love interest. When she discovers a plant, it's off to space. Again, Wall-E comments on society of today by showing how lazy we are coming and then at one point, all humans know how to do is sit in a hover chair and watch T.V., and drink meals from a cup. Wall-E of course brings light to not only the captain of the ship Axiom, but to a few passengers as well, who even though have lived their entire life upon the ship, failed to recognized they had a pool. But in the end, Wall-E isn't about trying to warn us about the future and what we will become. Above all, it is a love story, as most Disney movies are. But this one is one of the best, right up there with Beauty and the Beast, because it is a universal love story. The robots Wall-E and Eve don't necessarily speak a certain language, it is through their attitude and movements that they tell their love story. And of course being Pixar, it is an incredibly fun ride, with great funny moments (like the captain researching Earth). A truly great movie.",

A pathetic lack of imagination with even the Zarathustra of Strauss and the allusion to 2001, the Space Odyssey, an allusion that no kid can understand. Walt Disney is winking at the curators of the museum of cinematographic antiquities. In other words it can work in the US because they have no competition from the rest of the world YET.

249,30 June 2008,symphonyofnames,3, Not that great,"In lieu of a plot, this movie has a series of plot holes strung together, which all get overlooked on the premise if it being a kids' movie. This was not as great as everyone is making is out to be. I don't know why everyone has picked this particular Disney Pixar movie to make a stink about. The humor was nothing new; it's the same stuff they've been doing for years. They did start off with some good ideas. These ideas, unfortunately, were not developed nearly as thoroughly as they should have been. The first part of the movie features Wall-E rolling around doing nothing in particular, and some superfluous shots of a cockroach. When EVE's ship takes off, I was sitting in the theater, hoping and praying that Wall-E would get on it, as I watched everything that could be vaguely interesting in the movie try to fly away. What happened up in the ship wasn't much better though, so I don't know why I wasted time hoping. The focus was taken off of what could have been the real message of the movie: a commentary about how the corporate world and our increasingly leisure-filled lifestyle will one day destroy the planet and leave everyone in space. This is not a particularly new or original idea, and certainly not as brilliantly demonstrated as someone like Orwell or Huxley has already already done. The focus of the movie was taken off of this, and put onto a cutesy little romantic story about two robots who chase after the film's Macguffin (a plant). This really should have been more of a subplot. I felt like a lot of things could have been cut out without really changing the movie at all; a lot of mishaps the main characters face aren't really pertinent to the story at all. For example: the plant is taken away by a bad robot. The film's characters chase after it, invoking a lot of slap-stick comedy. And then, just when they get close to their goal, THE SAME THING HAPPENS. It's not needed. I felt like if they wanted to really make a point, they should have made their point and not tried to dumb it down.

252,2 July 2008,blackmamba99971,10, Absolutely fantastic,"This film has to be the most artistic representation of robots i have ever seen. The mixture of emotions running deep inside two of the most heroic pair, Eve and Wall-e. Pixar has done it again with this magical film, showing us a lone robot wall-e which stands for waste allocation load lifter. Being the only robot on earth to clean up a mess which humans had created over a period of a few centuries only to leave the planet so it can be cleaned by wall- e. Except an unexpected turn of events catapult him into space to an earth ship drifting on auto pilot, chasing down his beloved eve, which has found a plant, evidence that the humans can go back and start over. The duo then becomes closer than any human can resulting in a kindred love for each other and how they protect both each other and the humans from a rogue misfit auto pilot who wants nothing to do with the plant evidence. Only to keep the humans enslaved forever, never to return to earth. But as we all know these two lovable robots will not let anything stand in the way of change. This film made me laugh horrendously and nearly cry for the emotional tugs of how wall-e and eve connect so deeply with each other. They are different in shape and functions yet they bond so well and work together as one, that nothing is impossible as the auto pilot kept saying to himself. But it goes to show us on how quickly our earth can go in the crapper in such little time, and the only ones who we could depend on is with one small robot who collects nick nacks and lighters for a hobby and use them to his advantage. his independence walloped the more high tech gadgets and showed the humans and robots alike that heroism runs deep, no matter if it's circuits and batteries or blood and bone, and his sacrifice to do the right thing saved humanity. Eve on the other hand is his soul mate in the electronic world and without her, the kids of the earth could not learn the meaning of love,life,and caring about the ones you would die for. Everyone can learn from wall-e and eve. Hats off to pixar, thank you for giving us a most memorable film to date. And i hope you guys win some Oscars.",

Of course, as a thirty-something male, I never assumed Pixar movies were targeted to my demographic in the first place. ""Pixar is for kids"", after all, right? Then one day a 5-minute sneak peak was shown on TV featuring WALL-E and Eve (scene where he gets stuck in space capsule with plant). During those 5 minutes, the essence of WALL-E's character took hold and never let go. My girlfriend and I decided we wouldn't be able to wait any longer than opening day to see it. Embarrassing to admit, but I go the theater twice in a year at most, and yet I actually bought our WALL-E tickets 2 weeks in advance.",

But, WALL-E has heart, which is weird to say about a robot. The charming nature of WALL-E's love for EVE is too much to ignore and made me fall in love with this movie.

260,15 February 2020,Ryan_Barbakins,10, A Spectacle of a Love Story,"WALL-E is damn near perfect. I have never felt such emotional attachment for robots than when I watch this movie. Every character has a distinct personality while being a robot. The sound mixing is stellar considering they had to create these abstract sounds to represent the deepest parts of imagination. The story is super easy to follow even though most of the characters are limited to making random robotic noises as dialogue. In fact the first 30 minutes of the film are played out like a silent film.
Many complain that this film should have gone 100% with the silent aspect, and while I do see where they are coming from, I feel like the plot didn't have much elsewhere to go if they had just stayed on earth. There also seem to be many complaints about the environmental preachy-ness. I honestly never found it overpowering, in fact I felt that the love story prospered overall as the main part of the film.",
261,1 October 2009,badajoz-1,7, A refreshing surprise,"A refreshing surprise - a film that takes its own path and does not rely too heavily on cliché, references and violence. The start with little dialogue is brave, the animation good, and the story gathers you in. Some cute gags about the last robot left on Earth just carrying on doing his job, until alien probes begin to look around! A touch too sentimental in parts like old time Disney, but the plot whisks along. An excellent touch is that the humans, who finally get a look in some time in, all look alike and are obese, while the robots are generally very distinguishable. The plot is the same as 'Logan's Run' and the thriller denouement is '2001' but it still does not disappoint as familiarity creeps in over the last 15 minutes. good, no very good.",
262,22 December 2008,DJMo,9, Wall-E is an instant animated classic!,"Unlike other Pixar films, I went into this one knowing next to nothing about the characters or storyline. I was absolutely floored. The film reminded me of Kubrick's '2001' and Chaplin's 'City Lights' and 'Modern Time' with Wall-E as the cute Chaplinesque robot on a mission of self-discovery and love. Eve is the perfect foil / robot love interest (whose design was allegedly influenced by the iPod). How often can a film, much less an animated film, mesh romantic silent film with sci-fi, consumerist satire, and post-apocalyptic dark comedy all in one? Sure, the ""humans are slobs"" motif is a bit heavy-handed, but I suppose our society deserves the wake-up call, subtle or not. 'Wall-E' is hands-down the greatest animated film ever made.",

I absolutely love this film, I have seen it a couple of dozen times already. Wall-e is in all of us, the simple little person in us who lives in wonder of everything around us. I have spent the last 30 years working at a waste-water plant, a profession that others look down on, like our little hero who does a job that is needed. I relate to it with no reservations. His simple joys and his pain of unfilled love affects us all. Eve is the dream boat of his imagination - totally perfect except for one minor thing, her atomic gun which she uses to easily. The space trip is beautifully done with just the right amount of humor intertwined in it. You can't help but appreciate the time and details that went into this film, I even like it that we humans are shown in less detail (fat with low bone structure). If you have held back from watching this film, grab a bowl of popcorn, turn off the lights, turn up the volume and enjoy a great movie that will take you back to the time of warm-hearted Disney film classics that we all loved.",

It was the perfect night with such a nearly perfect movie. WALL·E is a message to children so that the children understand how fragile the earth is.

The message that I think was behind this movie was really good as well. A robot left behind and forgotten about cleaning up the Earth for 700 years and the only friend he has is a cockroach. Well I guess that he doesn't have very much else to do anyway. The animation was amazing. Some parts of the movie looked almost real. I went to the cinema and saw this twice and bought the DVD.

268,25 April 2018,Theodorum,9, An exception within the computer animated movie business,"I've always had a problem with computer animations, even in the early stages. With very few exceptions, they all look the same and follow the same ideas and patterns. Of course, the major problem is that they're keep coming, and getting more and more duller.
The graphics are simply not appealing to me; 3D computer generated animations simply lack emotions and depth. They might be on the right side of the uncanny valley, but there's still a problem with textures and facial expressions - eerily cold and somehow mechanic expressions. Hand-drawn animations are clearly more expressive, with natural movements and more spontaneity. This adds a warm touch to the overall atmosphere.
Now, for plot ideas and jokes; everything is recycled; same jokes, different faces. The jokes are a combination of wacky, witty and semi-satirical moments taken straight from Tex Avery or Hanna-Barbera production cartoons and the classy, emotional and romantic moments from the early Disney cartoons; actually, some ideas are copied even from other computer animated movies.
Of course, there are indeed some very few exceptions; this movie for instance; the computer generated images actually work here and paradoxically, the protagonists have real emotions. The fact that this movie doesn't rely on dialogues is another highlight here. There are some major mistakes here (ex. the effects of a ship leaning in space), but what the hell, I really don't care. I appreciate the sincerity of this movie.
A charming romance with a subtle satirical content and ""Do androids dream of electric ship"" concepts, for all the kids in the world.

A film visually extraordinary, a genuine love story, some exciting moments of adventure and with amazing comical parts that you won't stop laughing. But also has a very important message about making conscience of how we are taking care of the planet Earth. The story is very original, interesting, funny and even touching. With the least of dialogues, the movie carry you away with a very good rhythm and it never make it tiresome. The animation is fabulous, Pixar is always on a constant evolution. The music is great, every song fits perfectly and making a small reference to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and other movies.

This one represents everything we take for granted. Wall*E is a small compact robot left on earth when it is over run by waste. Wall*E has developed a personality that finds joy in the oddest objects. When robot Eve is dispatched to earth to find life they form a bond that eventually sends Wall*E into space to retrieve this new love. Watching robots attempt affection is a bit off, however the screenplay is both creative and inspiring. Director Andrew Stanton previously made the triumphant Finding Nemo as well as co-direct A Bug's Life. Fred Willard provides the only human character. He apparently led the evacuation of mankind into space after Earth became basically a toilet bowl. Where he is by film's end is not given, but other characters are voiced. Ben Burtt and Elissa Knight voice Wall*E and Eve but their whole discovery of emotion and love is difficult to comprehend. Jeff Garlin voices the ship captain who is among everyone who allowed themselves to get lazy and eventually too overweight to move. Finally, a Pixar film wouldn't be complete without the voice work of the ever refreshing John Ratzenberger. Visually the film is electrifying and curious. Theme regards love and affection resulting in a family film worth plugging into. Score: 9 / 10",

The movie works so well simply because the creators made you care so much about the characters, especially Wall-e and they do this without Wall-e having the ability to talk, which is a remarkable feat. The problem people seem to have when going to see a movie like this ( i am one of them, but i put it to the side for this one) is that they think, oh this is animated and rated G, its a kid's movie. Maybe some of them are, but this one surely was not. In fact, i'd say someone would have to be at least 14-15 years old to understand the concept the movie is going for. I know my 12 year old sister liked the movie, but did not understand the true purpose behind the plot. But because i did, i thoroughly enjoyed it until the end. Does Wall-e deserve to be in the top 20? At first i didn't agree, but after thinking about it a little bit, maybe it does. Not because this movie was groundbreaking, it wasn't. But because this movie did so many things, and it never faltered. It could have failed in so many ways, and yet it did not. It passed as a love story, sci fi story, and a story about modern day society and where we are heading. It 's the fact that it did all of this, and did it so well, that maybe it does deserve to be in the top 20. In conclusion, the movie does have some aspects for kids, but this is not a kid's movie and to deny yourself a chance at viewing an amazing movie like this on that basis alone would be stupid.

As with all Pixar movies the visual work is excellent and earthy tones used on Earth are beautiful. The problem really is with the pacing and the pretty obvious plot of the story.

Starring a box shaped little robot with more than a passing resemblance to E.T., WALL-E is quite possibly the cutest Pixar hero ever, despite the fact that he's a trash compactor with eyes.

Appreciation of animation is a cross-generational phenomenon that has become more diverse with the ushering-in of computer technologyplots contain enough colorful, slapstick humor to entertain the kids, but also a fair share of mature, witty writing to amuse their guardians. Yet still, I have never really gone out of my way to view these CG-rendered productions, and have always relied on the persuasion of others to give this emerging technique a chance.",
309,5 October 2008,ed_two_o_nine,10, Pixar's Greatest Achievement,"This put simply is a stunning film. A triumph on every level imaginable. Animation to make your jaw drop (Pixar raising the bar once again) tied to a great story (ok the green message is a little preachy) with little to no wasted scenes and what we have here is arguably the greatest CG animated movie ever made and quite possibly one of the greatest animated movies of all times. It was very bold of Pixar to move away from their tried and trusted buddy movie formula, and even bolder to make a movie which is for the most part a silent film. The humans' only enter the third and weakest act of the movie and then probably draw away from the always captivating Wall-e and Eve. The simple premise of the movie is that of Wall-e a robot whose sole purpose is to clean up the mess of the earth they abandoned long ago. Wall-e has a fascination for all things human which we are not sure where this comes from? Is this the result of circuits malfunctioning of just a loneliness from apparently being the last working robot left on earth? All we see is Wall-e one relationship he has is with his pet cockroach. This in it's self could probably carry the movie, bit when you add the relationship Wall-e eventually strikes up with the Female robot sent on a mission to earth (Eve) you really do get cinema magic that captivated the whole of the cinema I saw the movie in, from adults to the full range of children. Andrew Stanton has at this point an impeccable record off delivering films of the highest quality and if he did not work under the Pixar umbrella would probably receive a more star billing that his output deserves. This is that one off. A movie for the ages pure brilliance. Oh and to top if of the short that accompanies is 'Presto' is brilliant as well. Pixar's homage to Loony Tunes reminds us of the crime that we get in not seeing those classics on TV anymore and have to put up with pony modern versions of them.",
310,11 November 2009,dwpollar,8, Excellent animation movie with a message...,"1st watched 10/10/2009 – 8 out of 10 (Dir-Andrew Stanton): Excellent animation movie with a message. The story revolves around a world left in ruins to be cleaned up by robots(aka. Wall-E's) while the humans find refuge in an outerspace station where they are pampered and grow fat. Wall-E is getting a little bored of his routine where he day-in and day-out turns refuge into blocks and disposes of it. He gathers relics(similar to Ariel in ""Little Mermaid"") to make his time more interesting and has a friend in a roach with antenna's. Then arrives another robot searching for plantlife for the humans named Eve. Wall-E becomes infatuated with her but her prime directive is notifying the humans when she finds a plant and then staying in the spot until they return to pick her up. The idea here is when she finds it, they can come back to Earth to re-colonize. There is very little dialogue in this movie yet we understand the emotions of the characters, which shows us how amazing the animation is by the Pixar people here. There is a lot of slapstick similar to old Warner Brothers cartoons giving us plenty of laughs with a plus being a message about us taking care of our motherland, the Earth. This is a real step up for a cartoon studio and it's all done really well. It's amazing how such a small idea was expanded out to make this very well done movie. Another triumph for Pixar as they pick up from Disney's ways to rule the animation world in the movies of this current time.",
311,2 January 2011,lisafordeay,1, The most depressing film of all time,This was on TV last night and I never even heard of it before so I decided to check it out last night. I absolutely hated it and here is why. I saw the 1st 30 mins of this film and I was so bored I could fall asleep half way through. Its basically about a robot who works in a scrapyard in (I think by the looks if it)New York. He falls for a robot named Eve and he is obsessed with some film called Funny girl(you know the one with Barbara Stresland and Walter Mattheu and Micheal Crawford from that old TV sitcom Some mothers do have em. The film had no dialouge like Sleeping Beauty which was dreadful too and I cannot believe that this heap of junk won an Oscar(what is wrong with you people) and 45 awards from other film companies. I never liked Pixar except Toy Story was good but I rather watch the 1990s Disney movies or Enchanted which I loved than this pile of garbage. This should have won worst picture as it was dreadful.,
312,13 July 2008,Monotreme02,9, A crowning cinematic achievement,"First off, the animation itself is absolutely stunning. Pixar have perfected the craft of recreating realistic live-action photography in animation. Depth of field, out of focus objects, zooms  the look is spot-on. The animators also employ a wonderful colour palette, with enough variety and richness to keep things colourful and lively but also remaining very much rooted in reality. But really, the animators won me over right off the bat when, looking closely, I noticed tiny specs of dust floating around in the air during the opening scenes set around the garbage skyscrapers. With such a devoted attention to detail to make everything as realistic as possible, it's no surprise that Pixar are the leading studio for computer-animated films.",

Disney is supposed to cater to little kids, they do not know about the environment, so kinda threw me off. The only thing I knew the kids would love was seeing Wall-e make a mess out of his clumsy self. Also, I don't know if it's just me, but all of Pixar's humans are always fat. Yes, this one's plot line makes them that way but still, didn't seem any different than the humans in any other film. I loved the short before the movie, and honestly I wish that was the movie and this wasn't.

Andrew Stanton directs a near countless dedicated, passionate crew of artists and crafts people. Every fiber of their beings went into this, you can see it clear as day up on screen. A film so equally sad, thrilling, joyous as this. It's one of the best love stories ever, one of the best adventure stories ever, one of the best cautionary sci-fi stories ever (you get my drift). Like I said of their Ratatouille last year, WALL * E too is the perfect marriage between art and technology. We talk about symbolism and metaphor in a film, but rarely does it live so effortlessly in the very core of the story and the characters, in every ship design, every robot, apparatus, junk item, action, re-action, no action. Not only did I get teary eyed on an emotional level, but as a storyteller myself, I teared up at the sheer ingenious tapestry the film weaved. Like being there first hand, marveling at the technique, the instinct, the gusto, as Da Vinci painted the last supper or Michaelangelo sculpted David.

In the distant future (and if we're not careful, possible to happen) mankind has left the Earth because of the planet being completely covered with trash from products of powerful multi-national Buy N Large corporation. Alone on this planet is little garbage collecting robot WALL·E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class) (Ben Burtt) cleaning up the mess, a robot with a personality, fascinated with much of the human items in the pile of rubbish. One day, WALL·E finds a plant growing, and not too long after, a ship carrying EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) (Elissa Knight), a probe-droid, looking for signs of life shows up. It is when EVE sees the plant found by WALL·E that the ship comes back to collect ""her"", and out hero follows her all the way to the space cruise city ship with all humans evacuated 700 years ago. All humans by the way eat meals from a straw and are carried by hover chairs as they have become large with laziness, and losing bones, so they can barely move. EVE is determined to get the plant to the Captain (Jeff Garlin), who is fascinated by Earth after the brief good news, which comes to life again when he knows life on Earth can exist. The ship's computer AUTO (MacInTalk, a talking technology created by Apple), obviously inspired by HAL 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey, is determined to stop the Captain taking everyone back to Earth, so it is up to WALL·E and EVE to save the day.

WALL-E is almost perfect, with great characters, clever commentary, creative scenes, an interesting plot, an amazing score, and, even 10 years after its release, fantastic animation that hasn't aged a day. Also, in the entire first half of the movie, along with many scenes in the second half without human characters, Pixar is able to show us the setting, establish memorable characters, and fully immerse us in the world with practically no dialogue. To this day, I have never seen a film that did this on the same magnitude and with the same success as WALL-E.
 Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't already seen it, and even some people who haven't seen it in a while. Despite how memorable this film is, every once in a while, I still find myself watching it once in a while to experience the charm of WALL-E all over again.",
348,27 June 2008,bighaben,10," WALL-E, Best Pixar Film Ever?","I knew Pixar would pull off something new and original,and I knew it'd be classic Pixar, and thus at least good. What I got I didn't expect. Near perfection. This movie blows you away, with one heck of a dramatic opening. This could very well be one of the best openings you'll ever see, not only in animation, but perhaps in all of movie history. The tone set, and the characterization built encompasses so much in such little time you instantly fall in love with the character. Moving on from the 1st act you move into the 2nd act, where the absolute visuals and stunning emotional buildup slow a bit, following a few absurd moments you move into the even more quirky third act. While the movie moves away from the perfection of the first act, the remaining acts hold up very well, and you eventually settle into a train of thought like ""Well you can't really make it all perfect."" It's still very entertaining, and still very good. Just a touch slower and less dramatic then the first act. Oddly enough this may not be a great movie for the youngest ones to see. Most of the humor is complex, and I find that adults will get more of the jokes then the kids. While the kids will still have a great time, I think adults will really understand this movie, and will find it to be one of the best Pixar films ever made, kids may prefer the humor of Finding Nemo over the humor of Wall-e. Speaking of Wall-E, and his various companions, you will find yourself questioning some of the voice tactics at first, but they will grow on you, and you'll eventually find yourself saying that there is no better way to do it. The sound of the movie was utterly fantastic, and will keep you hooked just trying to figure out what original way they are going to express the world ""hello"". You will become attached, quite emotionally, to these characters, and there's even a touch of progression of AI technology as the new robots seem to have far more complex personalities, while Wall-E has a simpler yet more attachable personality. In short, this is a fantastic movie, with great music, and fantastic visuals that will blow you away. Watch it! Go!",

Thinking back on it now, I'm actually glad the trailers revealed nothing because from the moment I sat down and the film appeared on screen I was enthralled, surprised, and overall very satisfied. Finding Nemo was the latest animated feature that was able to make me feel emotions on a deep level rather than just the usual entertaining factor while watching these types of movies.

383,24 September 2009,dmrotstein,6, The only problem is suspension of disbelief,"Once again, Pixar has created a masterpiece in terms of animation, character development, fine details, and humor. As always, the plot is hardly original, but feels like it is. The musical score isn't as good as in Cars, but what would be? Sufficient to say that I was mesmerized by this movie and couldn't help but watching it over and over again. So why 6 and not 10, like any other Pixar movie to date (except Finding Nemo, which is simply too sad for a review)? Here's my problem: A plot can suggest anything, no matter how weird, but whatever happens, it must be internally consistent. There is nothing unbelievable about toys that come to life, or a world of cars or monsters or sentient bugs - those are legitimate concepts in the context of their respective movies. But here we have a world much like our own, which was destroyed by garbage, of all things. Why is it not self-consistent? Because we are presented with a civilization, which, despite its flaws (commercially oriented, monopoly-ruled), have achieved unimaginable technological wonders in terms of efficiency and reliability. Forget the hyper-drive, hover-cars, and blasters - those are sci-fi banalities. But here we have a ship, built for a five-year mission, but lasted centuries without any major malfunction. We have a robot the size of a child that flies with supersonic speeds, hovers constantly (even in a dormant state), and has a firepower of a large 20th century battleship. And she doesn't even need to recharge! Obviously she has an incredibly efficient but very small power source. And I mean very small, because we know she's almost entirely hollow inside! WALL-E himself is even more amazing - he's capable of fast motion and heavy lifting, not to mention a laser-like cutter, and his processor is powerful enough to sustain intelligence. But to power all that he has only a square foot worth of solar panel. Even if the panel is 100% efficient, its maximum output can't be greater than a 100 watts. But it only takes a few seconds to charge the batteries for many hours, if not days. That implies power requirements that a single AA battery can easily provide! And remember that those batteries are 700 years old! But the most amazing item is the fact that there is a lot of garbage on the ship, and it's constantly being ejected into space along with the air in the ejection chamber. At this rate, over the course of 700 years, the amount of ejected garbage would be many times the total mass of the ship, and the air would be completely gone long before that. Obviously, there is some sort of a matter-energy converter on board that keeps producing new raw materials, new air, and so on, and this production is easier and cheaper than garbage recycling, otherwise why dump it? The bottom line is that a civilization having such a technology shouldn't even produce any garbage, but even if it does, then with the resources which allow to send the entire Earth's population (and a very large one, considering the amounts of garbage we see) to luxury space cruises, it will not, can not meet its downfall because of garbage. In fact it could easily reconstruct the entire Earth's ecology from scratch. It would even make more sense to stuff the BNL fleet with this garbage and dump it all into the Sun. It would be enormously cheaper and safer to construct underground or domed cities, if the population was indeed interfering with the cleanup (and why would it?). An army of EVEs could melt all the garbage in a matter of days. And so on. But the best they could come up with was a bunch of tiny garbage picking robots? Give me a break! No, the very basis of the plot is too weak to make sense. Worse yet, unlike the characters, the plot is severely undeveloped. Where are all the other ships? What about the government? It's like the humanity was intentionally ""simplified"" to make life easy for the writers. But the second half of the movie is based on the most simplistic concept ever - put object A into object B (the plant into a detector in this case), and all the problems will be magically and instantly solved, with no additional effort. Such primitivism can work only once - and so it did in ""Lord of the Rings"", but enough is enough. Finally, the movie is plagued with silly and totally unnecessary astrophysical mistakes (too many to mention here). Carl Sagan was right when he suggested that every sci-fi film should have at least a graduate physics student as a consultant. The Galaxy is only a billion miles wide? People fall down in space? Microgravity!? Come on! Given all that, a 6 is more than this movie deserves. But it does deserve at least that - it's a wonderful, magical, emotional movie with an appropriate happy ending. It's just that it's based on a very poor script.",

386,19 November 2008,ltlacey,5," After years of polluting the Earth humans have left, and all the remains is 1 robot to clean up the mess.","Let me get the ratings over with first. If you are one of those people who are very concerned about our planet, and you happen to be under the age of 7, then you will probably like this movie and rate it very high. If, on the other hand, even if you are concerned about our planet and are not a little kid, you most likely will hate this movie. Not because of the message it is trying to convey, which is an important one, but because overall this is one of the most boring movies ever, even though visually this is one of Pixar's better achievements. If I had not had to watch it I would have turned it off after 9 minutes, and I usually give movies at least 20 minutes to get going. It took a good 35 minutes before anything of interest happened. So a good 1/3 of the movie is just WALL-E going about his business, compacting trash, and keeping items that he found interesting, making himself a little life and home with the trash humans left behind. He even had an old VHS musical that seemed to keep playing the same 2 scenes. His only interaction is with a cockroach (well acted I might add). Then one day a ship drops off a robot that is in search of plant life. This robot, which happens to be a girl (I had no idea there were girl and boy robots, but hey, this is 700 years in the future, so why not?) gets the interest of WALL-E, and he falls in love with her. When she leaves the planet he hitches a ride on the space craft. From there it got a tad more interesting, but only because we now had more characters, robotic and human, and some actual action (with good and bad robots of course), but the interaction between WALL-E and EVE was still dull (shades of Short Circuit and Electric Dreams...kind of). And we are also shown what will happen to humans when they have robots do everything for them and they spend all their time sucking down some drink and sitting/sleeping in chairs only watching ""TV."" Wait, aren't some of us already there? The plot was predictable, even down to the ET-like ""Don't leave me"" scene. And in the end the Earth comes back (of course, since those that ruined it left). The audience is then left with a ray of hope that the humans have learned a lesson. Yea, right. I will always wonder if the writers kept going and showed that the fat humans who did not know how to do anything would say ENOUGH! and shuffle back to the comfy life they once knew.",

WALL-E rescues Eve from a dust storm and shows her a living plant he found amongst the rubble. Consistent with her ""directive"" Eve takes the plant and automatically enters a deactivated state except for a blinking green beacon. WALL-E, doesn't understand what has happened to his new friend, but true to his love, he protects her from wind, rain, and lightning, even as she is unresponsive. One day a massive ship comes to reclaim Eve, but WALL-E, out of love or loneliness hitches a ride on the outside of the ship to rescue Eve. The ship arrives back at a large space cruise ship, which is carrying all of the humans who evacuated earth 700 years earlier. The people of earth ride around this space resort on hovering chairs which give them a constant feed of TV and video chatting. They drink all of their meals through a straw out of laziness and/or bone loss, and are all so fat that they can barely move.

I have seen all those movies, with the little exception of ""Cars"" (John Lasseter, 2006), but I don't own anything of Pixar on DVD yet I have some of their old movies on VHS, well actually just three of them. Is obvious that I was a bigger fan of Pixar when I was very young but is also obvious that Pixar movies were and still are great. In this case, like ""Ratatouille"" (Brad Bird, 2007), ""WALL·E"" wasn't the summer movie with the biggest publicity, received terrific reviews but unlike ""Ratatouille"" this one was placed on the first 10 of IMDb top 250 (at one point I saw it on the number 6).

The Wall-e animation, even though it represented a harsh truth and an end of the world concept. It also delivered a sweet and hopeful outcome that captivates the audience. In the first 40 minutes of the movie, the most interesting thing is how it demonstrates the story line without the use of words to show all the emotions that the characters go through. In the second part it demonstrate show the technology has effect the humanity and how their selfish and wasteful behavior has doomed their lives on earth to the point that they had to take refuge in spaceship. The citizens in this so called ''Space Station'' are so dependent to the technology that even their most basic activities are being done for them by machines. If you think about it , this is somehow similar to the life style we have today. As we evolution our god gets, our daily activities become easier and there for we don't have to work as hard. It has been quite some time that Pixar has changed its perspective on making animations. Their image has changed from making fairy tales to delivering more realistic story. Wall-e cannot be considered as just an entertainment for the children because adults can relate to its audience. It shows love, drama, action, humor and so an...

From the controversial storytelling elements of Ratatouille and The Incredibles to even the slow pacing of Cars, Pixar never follows the same formula twice (Even Toy Story 2 felt different from the original). While this adventurism is indeed good for the movie industry, it will have a tendency of missing the mark a few times. Wall-E is a defining example of risk taking to the maximum level. Blending no dialogue with slow pacing reminiscent of classic films, a bleak outlook on humans, and a space theme, this was recipe for financial disaster. Rarely do animated space films work, and even less when the content and plot is woven so deep that even most adults will miss the point. Wall-E is a beautiful, beautiful film, but an extremely tough pill to swallow. The movie-going audience of today would have trouble watching the works of Charlie Chaplin and even Stanley Kubrick for that matter. Our attention span has dropped in recent decades as a whole, and because of this, Wall-E forces us to let go of our usual methods in watching movies and makes us think, ponder, wonder, and perhaps even fear of what's becoming of our society.",

He has learned about love from watching a dull old Disney-like musical. One of those forgettable things that children hated, but were frequently brought to by their parents. He has established himself a sentient being with a loving soul. One day a slick rocket ship drops a probe into his garbage infested landscape. It is a porcelain-like, egg shaped beauty with deadly capabilities needed for self-preservation. This critter is egg shaped, unlike Wall-e's dumpy presence. He falls in love with her (she is definitely quite feminine. Like all desperate males, he does what he can to impress her, almost at the expense of his existence. The other interesting aspect of this film is the human element. Humanity has devolved into fat, slovenly lumps, with no thoughts or ambitions.

Just when you think that Pixar surely must have peeked, they raise the bar again. Their brilliance is in the realization that eye candy will only take you so far, it's the characters and the story that will decide whether the audience invests emotionally. That's the measure of this film, there is almost no dialogue between the two main characters, it's all animated, neither are human and yet they manage to articulate their emotions far better than many a living breathing actor. OK so you may not be getting the shades of grey that accompany a gifted actors performance, Daniel Day-Lewis can sleep soundly, but in my opinion Wall-E stands up when compared with the very best that ""real world"" cinema has to offer.

Wall-E doesn't speak but his eyes and his ""EEEVAA-h"" can express much more than an human actor, according to me.",
468,12 September 2008,kyle-cruse,7, Actually quite impressive; brilliantly done,"While I have heard mostly great comments on this film from people I know, a few have brought up the fact that there is little dialogue in the film overall. While I would I agree with that, it truly did not affect my enjoyment of the film. ""WALL-E"" is actually a brilliant little film, easily the best Pixar film made since ""The Incredibles"" (""Cars"" and ""Ratatouille"" were okay but definitely lacked what some of the earlier films had). Watching WALL-E (the last remaining robot on earth sent to clean up the trash and rubble after all of mankind has evacuated) collect artifacts such as toys and videotapes (""Hello Dolly"") was fascinating for me. This is truly a culturally-relevant film, commenting on our society and where we could end up (fat) if we don't change our ways. There are little funny moments that made the film enjoyable for me, such as the captain of a spaceship assuming that seeds on earth grow pizza. The romance between the two robots was not as annoying or corny as I would have thought, and I found myself truly hoping they would be happy together. Not an absolutely perfect film, but manages to entertain in a unique way most of us do not expect. Not Pixar's best, but certainly the best we've seen from them in several years. A worthwhile, fun, impressive film, good for families and adults. This looks like a future classic.",
469,3 March 2013,joemhoward,10," Masterful, intelligent and yes..a little preachy","I can understand some people's dislike for Wall-E. Yes, it could be construed as ""preachy"", but isn't all art with a message a little like that? When it comes to the environment, it is hard not to come across as preachy. However, that is just one facet of this truly magnificent film. Pixar really outdid themselves with the detail and beauty of the animation. The story is simple enough, and Andrew Stanton homages everything from 2001 to Star Wars in his movie, but in reality, Wall-E just kicks along beautifully. Its almost a silent film with beautifully dramatic and touching moments. It also puts across an apocalyptic message which for me, worked wonderfully, but as I said above, is preachy if you couldn't care less. And the love story at the heart of the film is as touching and moving as any I've seen and along with UP, Pixar have managed to outdo virtually any movie I can think of when it comes to romance.",

This is the heart of the matter - YOU are all okay with your cars, just be sure to recycle those cans, right, and make sure you drive back home in time to turn of the hall light bulb for ""Earth Day"" A cynical and banal film that gets it's philosophy from current thinking such as ""smaller paper towels = saving the planet."" Sorry, smaller paper towels are just smaller paper towels, and you'll end up using more of them. Why not use washable rags made from old t-shirts?

472,9 April 2021,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8, The little robot that could.,"'Wall-E (2008)' is a masterclass in visual storytelling, with relatively little dialogue used to propel its somewhat thematically complex plot forward. I mean, its protagonist doesn't even have a mouth (though he is able to mimic a small amount of speech). Yet, its eponymous robot is an immensity expressive, empathetic and entertaining lead because he is rendered with so much life and given so much character. It really is amazing. The other mechanical beings in the affair are almost equally as eloquent, too. In general, the film is an immensely pleasant viewing experience. That's despite the fact that it deals with a post-apocalyptic future in which the Earth has essentially been reduced to one large trash pile. These heavy themes don't weight the affair down, though, primarily because it's always playful and maintains a sense of hope throughout its entire runtime. It's the sort of picture that can make you smile without doing anything other than showing you its endearing lead characters interact with one another. That's not easily done. Its underlying narrative is efficient and, though its attempts to force some conventional danger into the fray at certain points almost feel slightly forced, it's an incredibly well-written piece (regardless of its overall lack of dialogue). It's an enjoyable time with wonderful visuals, amazing animation and the uncanny ability to warm your heart. 8/10.",

The story's heart is simple; a lonely robot doing it's job finds love(?) and struggles to keep it. Fine, I can deal with the 'robots with emotions' bit but there are too many plot distractions for me to enjoy the simple story. 1.Why are all the other WALL-E's non functional? 2. Why would they be nothing more than robotic trash compactors? 3. If everyone is gone, why is there power? 4. If all the plants are dead, then why is there air? (this is an assumption on my part, all left due to over garbage, bad air (seen in video message), but we see that the oceans are still there, so plankton should still be present, I thought I saw birds, so I'm confused as to why 'we' left. 5.

I used to think that these films can't capture human behavior & emotions simply because there are no blood & flesh characters. But after watching this flick, I am convinced that you can portray universal emotions as elegantly with gestures as with dialogs. At the core of Wall E is this sweet love story between two robots that captivates you right from the word go. Wall E's desperate attempts to impress Eve are hilarious enough. The climax is marked by a heart wrenching battle by Eva to save Wall E. The background score works wonders for the movie & beautifully captures the essence of the scenes. On the whole, its a film that would bring a big smile on your face. I am not sure if it stays with you for a long time but nevertheless a very enjoyable watch.

Our eponymous robot spends it's time packaging up waste into cubes, stacking them, then retreating to it's home of an evening before the storms hit! The planet has been decimated - only his friendly locust survives to keep him company. One fateful day, though, another craft arrives and it's occupant ""EVE"" is soon a-scanning and making friends - after a shaky start - with her more indigenous pal. Things take quite a turn when ""EVE"" discovers what it was sent to find - a life form. In this case a tiny shoot. Alarm bells ring and shortly afterwards a spaceship arrives to collect ""EVE"" and the foliage. Not about to be left behind, the ship soon has a stowaway and we are presented with an explanation of just what happened to humanity - now, basically, a bunch of armchair-bound, boneless globules of flesh - who think they've been on an intergalactic cruise for the last seven hundred years! Can they all get back to Earth and sow the seeds of humanity's redemption? Well not without a little bit of automated interference and some fun escapades that are engaging and touching. The fate of our race is in the hands of these two mechanical creations - but the broader meaning here is clear as a bell. If we continue to treat the planet like it is our own personal garbage dump, then we will reap what we sow! Entertaining and thought-provoking without resorting to simplistic pontification, politicisation or lawlessness. Well worth a watch.",
494,20 January 2019,tabuno,8, Breaks New Animation Ground in Its Script,"27 June 2008. We are seeing the birth of a new form of life brought to the screen of animation. It is sometimes quiet without much dialogue, there is plenty of periodic humorous physical comedy, there is a message, a ""big"" one that is being broadcast to all of mankind here. While there are rough edges in this movie that is literally cluttered with the remains of humanity, this bold and creative adventure dazzles, makes us laugh and keeps young children's interest. There is something both childish (in this new beginning of animation) and innovative potential (there is more to come). There are fantastic physical, non-verbal communication movements in this nicely nuanced movie - there is eventually much heroism, and action-adventure surprisingly as this movie builds from its lonely, isolated beginnings. While it doesn't quite achieve the sustained underlying complexity, depth, and consistency of Spirited Away (2001) as a mature art form, the sustained action and emotional connection and powerful themes of The Incredibles (2004), WALL*E is amazing and definitely breaks a creative threshold on its own.

I've reviewed a number of CGI films on IMDb before, and I always make it clear that an animated movie made with computers doesn't automatically make it good, let alone great. Having said that, Pixar, in my opinion, has yet to make a mediocre movie. The closest they have come to mediocrity is ""A Bug's Life"", and I would probably rate that movie with 8 out of 10 stars. It was a well animated film with witty dialogue and intriguing characters, but it didn't top either ""Toy Story"" movie or even movies that came after it like ""Finding Nemo"".

One day they happen to stumble across another being, something not immediately attached to the 'world' they've been living in – an agent from the 'outside' that comes down, shrouded in mystery but also danger. In the respective films' case, it is The Giant itself and EVE in this particular film.

WALL-E is the pinnacle of animation, successfully steamrolling lesser animations in its path, ahem, take THAT kung fu panda. Capitalizing not on sheer star-power like every Dreamworks animation preceding it, instead, Pixar utilizes brilliant animation and wonderful storytelling to unfold a tale of love featuring the loneliest of characters, WALL-E. WALL-E's story has environmentalist overtones not unlike a decidedly far inferior movie this summer, but it's never brought to the forefront of the movie as it is, again, a love story. WALL-E captivates us with his human-like curiosity, and his very vibrant yet glassy eyes will reduce you to a swooning 12 year-old girl. I promise. The robots chirp, purr, and beep all in their own very cute dialect, but the absence of dialog, especially for the first twenty minutes, does not hinder the progression of the story.

520,17 May 2023,GusherPop,10, CLASSIC!!!!,"Pixar's ""WALL-E"" is an enthralling animated film, a visual wonderment and a decent science-fiction story. It works largely without spoken dialogue, making it easy to cross language barriers and tell a planetary story. It is also a film that can easily cross language barriers, as it tells a planetary story. WALL-E is a solar-powered robot that is the last of the functioning solar-powered robots. He scoops up trash, shovels it into his belly, compresses it into a square, and climbs on his tractor treads to the top of his latest skyscraper to place it neatly on the pile. The skyscrapers are constructed out of garbage, compacted into squares or bales and piled on top of one another. WALL-E's age-old routine is shattered when a sleek spaceship appears in his world. He is scooped up by the ship and returned to the orbiting spaceship Axiom, along with his most recent discovery: a tiny, perfect green plant, which he transplanted to an old shoe. The movie has a wonderful look, with a color palette that is bright and cheerful, but not too pushy, and a tiny bit realistic at the same time. The drawing style is Comic Book Cool, perfected in the funny comics more than in the superhero books. The design of WALL-E, for whom I felt a curious affection, is rusty and hard-working and plucky, and expresses his personality with body language and (mostly) with the binocular-like video cameras that serve as his eyes. The movie draws on a tradition going back to the earliest days of Walt Disney, who reduced human expressions to their broadest components and found ways to translate them to animals, birds, bees, flowers, trains and everything else. The film ""Finding Nemo"" is directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton, who wrote and directed ""Finding Nemo"". It involves ideas, not mindless scenarios, and involves a little work on the part of the audience and thought. It could be especially stimulating to younger viewers, and could have been a great science-fiction film.",

523,17 August 2008,rsa5387,9, Spellbinding,"Another great effort from Pixar, though it does not scale the heights of last years Ratatouille, its still a commendable effort that deserves the highest praise for its imagination and sheer bravery. With a plot that is far beyond the scope of normal...(read more) kiddie fare, very little dialogue, and an absence of cute fuzzy creatures, Wall-E succeeds due to the strong characterization of its protagonist (sans dialogue), a wholly believable plot that does not drag, and its stunning animation (the beginning shots of Earth, the trip into space, and the robots on the ship being highlights). If theirs one flaw, I would say the film is far too preachy. Though its intentions are noble, the message becomes jarring in the 2nd act, and its ending left me with more questions than answers. Like, what are they going to do now? So what if one plant was salvaged, it does not mean Earth is once again ripe for sustaining life. Those small criticisms aside, I thought Wall-E was not brilliant, but was another enjoyable Pixar product with something profound to say, and once again proves that animation is not just for the kiddos.",

It is a run of the mill love story with a dystopia setting where man has been driven off earth because they trashed it. A very environmentalist viewpoint which is disappointingly simple for Pixar and in the class of Happy Feet as far as I am concerned with is a death knell normally for me, but it rises above the previous films problems by having a keenly interesting and investing main character in Wall-E.

526,3 January 2009,steve2901,10," If it doesn't get a Best Picture nom at the Oscars, it won't be getting the recognition it deserves.","Disney/Pixar's ""WALL-E"" is probably the most touching film I've seen in years, and probably one of the most original concepts in years. Forget the environmental message; it's a love story, through and through. And yes, the protagonists are robots who have a limited vocabulary, but their chemistry is more pronounced than that of other recent romances such as ""The Notebook"", and especially that garbage known as ""Twilight"". Coming from a straight bloke, WALL-E is actually the only film to ever make me go ""awww"" out loud; it's one of the sweetest, cutest love stories ever told, and the way the film Hello Dolly! is used to show how WALL-E has learned to love is genuinely moving; his early attempts to hold EVE's hands are really something. And when his devotion to his new companion is repaid, you're really jumping for joy for this little guy; it really is the most romantic film since Beauty and the Beast. The scene where WALL-E and EVE dance around the Axiom is as romantic and spectacular as the now-famous, iconic ballroom dance scene on Beauty and the Beast, the only animated film to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. I emphasise this point; WALL-E, a picture that has touched and moved just as many people, surely should get more than just a nomination for Best Animated Feature. It really isn't enough for this film to win just that award. Forget The Dark Knight - WALL-E is the film that we'll be remembering from 2008.",

In the beginning, there were long stretches without dialogue when Wall-E was still on the barren earth. The action and my attention only picked up when the human form was finally seen on screen. And when we see the humans of that time, we see lazy obese creatures who could not even get up from their automatic car beds. This was really a funny yet disturbing view of a future where the computer all but takes over human thoughts and actions. I can clearly see the homage to ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" with the Master Computer and all. The message in the end to take care of our planet is universal and encouraging. The excellent quality of the film is very apparent despite the less than ideal way I was watching it. The romance between Wall-E and Eve, while obviously there, I must admit I did not really get all the nuances in this viewing.

There was a lot of debate about it on the forum. A lot of people hated it and said they walked out; some were offended. This made me actually want to go see it. My favorite movies are written and directed by David Lynch, and so many people hate those movies. Sometimes I think that people just need their sh*t handed to them on a silver platter - they don't like to actually have to THINK about the plot. ...Not that Wall-E is hard to follow, but it takes a certain caliber of intelligence to appreciate a film that doesn't have any dialogue for the first 40 minutes. In my opinion, to pull off getting your audience to connect to a character so intensely without him saying a word of dialogue is just pure brilliance.

It reaches for the stars and never stops aspiring. This is the first time Pixar has mixed in live action video too - not sure I liked it but it's novel nonetheless. I most especially liked the first 30 min of the movie set on Earth where we meet Wall-E and live sort of his daily life of wonder. Surely some of the reviewers here will remember Short Circuit - whose Johnny 5 had the same sorts of humor. In that movie the warnings and theme's dealt with the military, here of course it's the environment. This sort of message was shrewdly placed and a little bit overdone but diluted with some humor as well. Wall-E brings a fresh experience without a lot of the camaraderie of past productions, and may be the most majestic Pixar Production to date.

However a probe feminine robot is sent to earth to estimate conditions there and a romance starts between her and the poor little robot called Wall-E which leads to a series of proper that turns down in the end on a much more human finale. The philosophy of this movie after all goes against the usual trend of these computer animated movies which privilege mechanical values instead of human ones. Here the human and nature values finish by bearing the palm over the artificial cold mechanical ones.

There are three main reasons WALL-E's an amazing film. The first reason for this is the first half of the movie, the entire first half of the movie has almost no dialog, besides the occasional ""Wall-E"" and ""Eva."" I greatly respect this because it's hard to make a movie when you have only physical comedy to express how the character is feeling and thinking. This is the closest movie to a silent film that I've seen in a very long time, and for that the movie is great. The second reason this film is so great is the second half of the movie. It shows us where we might be headed if we keep consuming. This movie has effected me more than An Inconvenient Truth.

The problem is the jokes aren't really that funny, and, most seriously, it's lacking any real drama. The tone is almost always kept on a very bland, non-threatening level. The movie starts out strong, on Earth, where the most accomplished, realistic animation takes place. Also, in the early scenes, the music is actually interesting (Louis Armstrong!) When the movie leaves Earth, though, it becomes more like a cartoon, and the music gets extremely bland. The group I went with were all very disappointed, based on the rave reviews we'd seen. The classic Disney movies like Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Pinocchio had real drama! I guess they're considered too scary for kids nowadays. (By the way, don't expose your kids to any of those scary fairy tales like Little Red Riding Hood and Hansel and Gretel - you'll warp their little minds!) Anyway, I recommend seeing this movie because it's a unique achievement, but lower your expectations.",

I liked the lessons the movie so subtly delivers to the targeted audience (don't think it's my generation).

585,8 September 2008,EijnarAmadeus,9, Another Pixar Home-Run,"Pixar's peerless filmography is nothing short of amazing, undefeated their armor shines in full giddy glory by 2008's WALL-E, another brilliant animation-movie. Always developing, they hand us two main characters who barely speak and who after all are robots, so any facial expression or emotional moment are created by R2D2-ish sounds or a small wink by the hand - it's minimal, but it's perfect. The atmosphere of WALL-E's astonishing tale of love and rebooting the now fatty-society-of-the-galaxy of 2800 showcases storytelling at its best. WALL-E is an amazingly well crafted creation, his longing-for-company is heartbreaking as well as hilarious - and what seems to be a lonely-robot tale transforms into a somewhat exhilarating story of breaking free from chains and freeing mankind from a computer-steered-world-of-politics-and-society. In one brilliant scene we see one of the fatty-girl's swapping free from ""computer land"" and actually realizing where she is, and she also comes in contact with a man - the flirting seems alien to them, as they're in reality not doing anything except talking gossip and eating/drinking, because they're only sitting on their bloody arse! The criticism of society is inevitable.",

WALL-E is among the greatest love stories, dystopian science fictions, dark comedies, and archetypical hero stories, all at once. None of these elements overpowers any other, nor does any fade into the background. WALL-E's success is in its balance.

I really started watching this movie with an open mind, but from the tedious intro, to the completely forced romance, the boring non-existent story and up to the stupid final I was utterly and completely disappointed.

The setting is post-apocalyptic dystopian--along the lines of Blade Runner. The surviving humans all look like the Pillsbury doughboy and have slow mental processes, as though they have been gorging on too many doughnuts and desperately need to get the oxygen flowing through their bloodsteam. (Maybe a brisk walk after a cup of black coffee?) To be honest, this depiction verges on fat-shaming (note: I am thin), although some might view it as a cautionary tale: if you have a desk job and never go out for exercise and eat too much processed food, then your body will end up looking like that of the Pillsbury Doughboy.",
589,16 March 2021,saadanathan,9, The best Pixar has ever made 9/10,"WALL - E is probably the best movie Pixar has ever made, as long as I live ""Finding Nemo"" will always be my favorite. But regardless to ""Finding Nemo"", this movie is probably the most creative and original Idea Pixar has ever made. We start on Earth where it has become an uninhabited planet, a little robot is tasked with reorganizing earth to it's original state. Things go out of order and the little robot goes on a quest that will decide humanity's fate. What makes this film so amazing is of course Wall - E. A dependent, funny, cute and wise robot who steals the attention at the very first second of the movie. Wall- E is unlike any other robot, he finds interest in everything and uses his knowledge and skills to survive on earth. He is also shown as having feelings and emotions towards others, such as when he first meets EVE. The chemistry between the two is adorable and captures the hearts of all the audience. Personally my favorites were Wall - E and M.O. they were so funny. I think there is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, it is nearly flawless, this movie fits perfectly to the case of ""show, don't tell"". The exposition is shown directly and beautifully. Every moment of the film in general is shown marvelously and taught of real well: the axiom, the people moving around with floating chairs, the similarity between Auto the villain to the villain from 2001 A Space Odyssey, the relevance to today's world and plenty more. If Earth ever gets uninhabited (due to a global pandemic maybe?) So we will really feel the relevance to this movie, overall Wall - E is a masterpiece of cinema and animation, my favorite moments are when Wall- E is in space for the first time and when he and EVE are dancing in space (pure genius). If you haven't seen Wall - E yet so shame on you, go watch it! The best movie Pixar has ever created.",

WALL·E and EVE are delightful and adorable characters with a story told by an unbelievable screenplay that compels and engages even with such little dialogue.

However, after sitting in the theater for the first hour, (Which felt like at least a week), I couldn't decide if I would rather have the movie end immediately or have something actually happen in the movie. Neither wish came to fruition. The movie dragged out for what seemed an eternity, with nothing happening. It became clear during the second half of the movie that this was really a ""Save the Planet"" commercial, and I'm all for it, but couldn't they have made it entertaining? Or perhaps made a good movie and then just passed out ""Save the Earth"" pamphlets at the end. I was painfully aware throughout the entire movie that neither my son or I had even chuckled during this film. Watching garbage fall on a little robot, or seeing him roll down a hill of trash just isn't that funny. Especially the tenth or eleventh time. Wall.e reminds me of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", critically acclaimed, but absolutely unwatchable. In all fairness, I've never actually made it to the end of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", and I wish that I had walked out on Wall.e as well.

I'm sorry but this is just totally overrated just as ""Star Trek"" is being rated right now. They are both good, but great films... no. Pixar has never made a bad film, ever and no other studio can come close to saying that. Granted they have only made 10 films ever but still that is amazing, not to mention they're huge Box office record. Maybe seeing this again someday will spark something in order for me to think it's a perfect film, but I doubt it. I can definitely see why think this is good, it's just not perfect. It shouldn't be in the top 250 that is for sure. Especially since it's above ""Toy Story"" on the list and ""Toy Story 2"" isn't even there at all. Well we shall see which films hold up better in the long run. It didn't help that they just had to stick an environmental message permeating throughout it too. It would be fine if it was a sub-plot not completely smacking you in the face over and over again.

Their exploits remain charming and funny as the action moves up to the space station, where machine fed human-blobs await salvation. But I find the blob-people annoying and TOO cute up against the robots. Worse than this, though, is the machine-tooling of the moral. Listen, kids: Hollywood's sentimental narratives of human progress used to depict change which was led, however unconvincingly, from below. Here it's down to the blob ship captain to save humanity for his underlings. So, for all the explicit urgency of the environmental-catastrophe messaging - and in spite of the identification young viewers are obviously meant to feel with the consciousness-raising robots - the net effect is to reassure the viewer not to worry, that Big Daddy will take care of everything if we just bleep truth to power.

633,26 July 2008,dmaboyer,3, Animated version of ' An Inconvenient Truth',"Nothing like hitting you over the head with the ecology message. Nothing subtle about the message in this movie. Granted, most movies, especially kids movies, have an underlying message but this is to blatant. Without dialog it was mostly this wheeled machine whizzing around. That is cute for a few minutes and for the first few minutes the CGI holds your attention but with no plot you can only watch a cute CGI robot for so long. Young children will probably like this because of the cute robot but adults are going to get bored real soon. It would have made a nice 30 minute TV special but as a full length movie it was just too long. I especially could not get into the animated humans. They did not seem in anyway realistic. I would have preferred a mixture of live humans and CGI. The love story in the beginning was OK. The way Wall-E ""stalked"" EVA, but once the story left earth and got to the spaceship the plot vanished and it became dull. I did not really care that much about Wall-E. He was not cute enough to really get to like and without a voice their was no way to really get to know him. All in all, I think if they had stayed with Wall-E and EVA having a love affair on Earth and forgotten the spaceship it could have been an OK movie.

639,19 July 2008,llewdebkram,5, An OK movie with over-hyped reviews,"I'd given up on Pixar movies after The Incredibles, not because I thought they were not going to be any good but because of the deluge of CGI buddy movies from every studio out there, which is the same stuff churned out over and over. But then WALL·E came out and with it came fantastic reviews and nothing but praise which I though meant CGI movies had at last turned a corner and left the usual cliché stories behind. Unfortunately I was wrong and there is nothing new to see here and I think people are getting over emotional about WALL·E because it confronts them with what a lot of us know already about multinational companies and how they really only care about profits and any attempts to be 'green' to help the planet is only worth it when it creates more profit for them. There are some great moments in the movie but it just isn't as fun as the earlier Pixar movies which was evident to me after my 2 children of 6 and 8 who usually love all animated movies asked 'when is it going to finish' every 2 minutes from about half way into the movie. An OK movie but nowhere near as good as the hype and reviews suggest.",
640,10 July 2011,nickmesafilms,8, WALL*E (2008) - 700 Years Later...There's Still Freaking Robots!,"As the ninth movie in a series of Pixar animated features, ""Wall-E"" is set 700 years into the future, and it tells the story of the last robot on earth, named WALL-E. He is then visited by a glowing robot named EVE, who WALL-E starts to fall in love with. He then goes on an adventure through space, and learns valuable life-long lessons of love, to be with his one true love. This is why this movie is so excellent for what it is. The romance between WALL-E and EVE was so touching and beautiful, which makes them bright and colorful characters. After years of talking toys, talking bugs, talking monsters, talking fish, talking cars, and talking rats, Pixar has finally made a movie that tugs into the heartstrings. Director Andrew Stanton brings another excellent Pixar movie since ""Finding Nemo"". He brought a visionary touch and feeling to this film, and uses robots to make a resemblance of love and being true to one's self. The characters are lovable, the story is charming, the animation is visualizing, and this movie has such heart, you can't go wrong with this movie. Who doesn't enjoy watching robots with heart that don't really say anything for the first half of a Pixar movie? ""Wall-E"" is a wonderful portrait of art that creates a big impact of people in need of finding love. This is one of my favorite Pixar movies of all time. ""Wall-E"", in my review, ""a visually charming romance story, with impressive robots"".",

But since last year, there's been plenty of room for improvement. Ratatouille was so-so, 7.5/10. It had some good elements. I'm not sure if Pixar's growing down or if I'm growing up, but this movie was pretty dull. The short film at the beginning is wonderful, 10/10. But the movie itself was not. There were quite a few laugh out loud scenes. (Like when WALLE and EVE kiss with their foreheads and he floats away, or when he continually scratches M-Os floor.) But most of it was not entertaining. Keep in mind I'm almost 14, but I've been the biggest Pixar fan ever my whole life. So maybe this review isn't perfect for a 12-15 year old. It may be very well suited to a 5-8 year old.",

As I watched, I realized that I bought into whatever Wall-E wanted and desired, and hoped that he would find someone to share all the little bits, that made him so lovable, with.

Kids will eat it up. The sound was excellent since there is hardly any dialogue at all until halfway through the movie. There is a good message behind the film and all, but to be honest I got bored. Sure the animation was top notch and visually may be one of the best pixar movies to date, but the story lacked in my opinion and failed to keep me interested. The best part of this film was the short film before the movie started. ""Presto"" is by far the best pixar short I've ever seen, it was worth my $7.50 just to see it. In conclusion, it's not a bad movie to go see on a rainy day or if your kids are dying to go to the pictures, but if I were you I'd wait and rent it when it comes out on DVD.",

This is a movie you have to like pixar and animation movies. I am not a big fan of animated movies but I watch some and like them. Like Kung Fu Panda for instance that was very good. This on the other hand was pointless and boring. For kids they would definitely like this movie. I thought it made no sense between the whole outer space and then earth stuff. They kept going from place to place. In ways yes it was cute and WALL-E was pretty fun to watch. The movie had a little love story for the animation movies. Kids might understand it.

However, within the first 5 minutes of the movie when WALL*E the robot first appeared on screen, all of my attention was completely focused on him.

The first 30 minutes of the film has no dialogue at all, only sounds, beeps, etc. However, the film doesn't even need dialogue to tell you how the characters feel. This is all achieved by body language and the sounds they make. Pure amazement. This film is definitely at the top with other Pixar movies, like Toy Story, The Incredibles, and Finding Nemo. It isn't only one of the best movies of the summer, or year, but all time. This will definitely go down in movie history. Even if you are not a child or don't have any kids, you will still enjoy this movie. Just because it is animated doesn't mean it is a children's film. If you are a Pixar fan you will love it even more. It towers over the 2006 film Cars, which is a failure in my opinion. You should definitely see this movie. Pixar has mastered the realms of living toys, bugs, monsters, fish, super heroes, rats, and now robots. This film is worth your money. If you don't get a chance to see it in theaters, buy it when it comes out. It is worth your money.",
657,15 February 2015,FedRev,10, A powerful critique of consumerism,"WALL·E is a digitally animated film about the last functioning robot on Earth tasked with cleaning up the planet after mankind destroyed the environment and was drowned by consumerism. With garbage piling up and no where else to go, humanity abandoned the planet and programmed small robots to clean up the mess. In his isolation, WALL·E has developed a unique personality. He cleans up garbage by day and watches musicals on an old TV by night. Then everything changes when EVE arrives, another robot sent to scan for life on Earth in the hope that humanity can return to the planet they ruined. The film is an entertaining children's movie, but it's also overtly political with a strong critique not only of the wastefulness of consumerism, but also the self-destructive nature of capitalism itself. The fictitious corporation Buy-N-Large is featured throughout the film, and it's the only company shown in an obvious satire of the way corporations expand to destroy their competition (and the rest of the world in the process). WALL·E is filled with heart and ultimately hope, and it demonstrates the power of cinema to say something important without losing sight of entertainment.",

I agree that this film has clichés, that it occasionally lacks substance and that the narrative sometimes lacks direction but SO WHAT? Did I miss something? When did this film advertise itself as a historic milestone of cinematic genius? At what point does the synopsis imply that the viewer will be kept pondering until the ultimate denouement when it's finally discovered that all was not as it seemed? GET A GRIP! Not all films are there to be dissected and analysed by pseudo-intellectuals with an over-inflated sense of their own importance and way too much time on their hands. We COULD sit here and analyse the cartoon Tom & Jerry pointing out the racist undertones, the overt animal cruelty and the inaccuracies to real-life situations OR we could get a life!

Pixar has become the most influential animation studio on the planet to this date. Wall-e is absolutely mind boggling with camera sequences and lighting and brilliant special effects. The story is top notch on how we the people have or are becoming complacent in our daily lives and how we all depend on mechanical things to keep ourselves lazy in so many ways. In the film when we see earth nearly barren of all life except for one little plant that an eve robot had recovered from wall- e. The idea of seeing our world slowly drying up and dying is more profound than most of us realize. We are not in the position to go into space yet like in this film, but in the near future it is not far off from what we or scientists know because of all the global warming and such. Governments who are key in promotional exploration of oil do not care what the people think any more. We are not necessary to bring about the changes we need to keep ourselves from destruction, and the government knows this. Yet in this film even protocols can be broken to free the minds of individuals of oppressions or slavery to their own demises. And you know something?, not one government official would ever see this film on his or her own, because if they did, their conscience would ultimately change the way our lives have been. Yet military issues and others keep the oils at bay by force now, nobody can be free from the governments unless we become just as free as wall-e and eve. We can certainly learn from both of them.",
663,12 January 2011,dragosmarcean,9," A Wonderful Pixar production,but....","As usual, Pixar managed to impress it's audience with it's amazing movies. Wall-E is one of them. The graphic detailes are exquisite. The fluidity of the character's movement is, as usual, incredible. The deailes ar very realistic. You can almost feel like you are gathering the trash allong with Wall-E. The sounds are as realistic as they can get. The explosions made were so realistic that almost made me shiver as I watched the movie at a higher volume. The rocket's landing made you feel like you were in Wall-E's shoes and you were digging to save your life. Some things that I didn't like and the motive that I gave it 9 and not 10: The expression of Wall-E's eyes symbolises a life on Earth with it filled with garbage. Even if he looks sad, he actually has all the emotion of a human being: love, fear, timidity, careness, anger etc. Still the constant sadness in his eyes doesn't work for me. The fact that every person on the ship was morbidly obesse, shoes what to much advanced technollogy can to to a person. It has the role to make our lives better and not destroy them. That made me think about the future of my great-grand children. Also, the first space travel between Earth and The mother ship was a little boring. And the lack of funny dialogues was a minuse of this movie. I understand that the robots were saying only a couple of words, but in a movie I prefer dialogue humor. ""Wall-E"" is the kind of film that makes you cry or say""AAAWWWW!"" and laugh at the same time.",

Every scene from the desolate Earth to the vastness of space bursts with some of the most beautiful animation committed to film.

WALL-E rather cheerfully goes about his ""directive"" to the tune of his favorite film, 1969 Technicolor bombast ""Hello, Dolly!"".

672,27 June 2008,michaelnakan,10," Best Pixar Movie yet, and coming dangerously close to perfect.","A robot who picks up garbage on a deserted Earth. Virtually zero dialogue. A message regarding pollution. A true recipe for disaster. But in a move surprising no-one, Pixar has made it work, and work it does. It's truly a brilliant movie, with virtually no issues to bog it down. The plot revolves around Wall-E, a dinky little robot which goes around picking up garbage, from which he salvages a few things. A rubics cube, a spork, a plant; all interesting things which Wall-E finds and keeps. He also watches an old copy of ""Hello, Dolly"" which he finds endlessly amusing, to the point that he reenacts a dance scene with a garbage can. But Wall-E wants someone to love. And thats the true plot that guides this movie. Wall-E falls in love with an apple-ish robot named Eve, and the movie chronicles their time together. I suppose you could go anywhere for informed opinion about how great this film is, but I wanted to go over some of the faults found, namely pacing. Do not let these comments throw you off. This film has virtually no repetitive moments at all, and Wall-E more than makes up for it with its titular main character, who invokes immediate sympathy and trust. Wall-E is so good because of the pain you feel for the little robot, and the fact you can identify with him. He's the everyman whose fallen for the supermodel, and when him and Eve get closer you really feel a connection. Well it's late, but I must urge you to see this movie. It carved itself a hole in the top ten movies of all time (top 5?) for me, and it's very nearly perfect.

It is an absolute must-watch for all people, children and adults across the world alike.

Leave behind your expectations and prejudices. Go in to see WALL-E with an open mind and an open heart and you will be rewarded as you never have before. The artistic detail of garbage-strewn earth, the space ship (part Carnival Cruise Line, part Enterprise), and the various workings of every single robot (pivoting heads, jointed legs, detached hands, a different personality and ""voice"" for each) is a dizzying delight. And WALL-E and EVE are the cutest couple since Lady and the Tramp. As many others have commented, their communication needs no dialogue. WAL-E's huge searchlight eyes and EVE's computer screen baby blues speak volumes not to mention their vastly different, but somehow compatible hands. Their love dance in space will leave you wondering which to cheer, the characters or the animators. And, as always, reliable Pixar sets itself apart from ""kid's movies"" that depend on sly pop references (touchpoints from ""2001,"" ""Star Trek,"" and ""Alien"" don't count) and potty humor. A film with genuine imagination doesn't need these things. You would think that the fat, lazy former earthlings would be disgusting, but they are not. They're good, cheerful people who don't know any better. Their awakening to what human beings and their planet should really be is a gratifying part of the plot. Watching the captain get hooked on the facts provided by the computer about what earth was like, you root for him to learn about human joy and duty before his HAL-like robot assistant catches him. Long-distance shots are breathtaking and funny by turns. One of the best visual jokes is when the ship's robots are all moving in an exact geometric pattern, when WALL-E and a bunch of off-kilter 'droids he has freed from their repair shop/asylum come barreling in from all directions and scatter their counterparts like rolling marbles. The only reason I withheld one star is that a couple of sequences go on a little long after they have contributed to the plot.

678,13 April 2020,krational66,8, Wall E,"Although WALLE is a run-down robot that smells like dirt (and garbage) from a distant, rural planet, he has succeeded in wooing the goddess of his heart -- EWA, a masterpiece of the highest technology and a consummate showman. WALLE's success gives us valuable enlightenment:
1, even in the remote rural areas, you have to be a backbone, a small talent. Although WALLE doesn't look like much, as the last little cleaning robot on the planet, he can still walk around squelching around when everyone else is doing well. He knows how to repair themselves, know how to protect themselves, small life lonely but also full of fun. Too strong survival ability is the primary condition for the pursuit of high-quality women.
2. You'd better be an artistic youth or similar. Don't look at WALLE, who is clumsy, but has a curious nature and a wide range of hobbies. She is a compulsive collector (though not a very good one), enjoys watching movies and listening to music, has a pet (a cockroach), and dreams of romance (she takes her girlfriend boating, watches the sunrise, even makes her a robot doll and dances the cosmic tango with her). Women are generally romantic in nature, if you are more romantic than her, then not many people can resist you.
3, invincible zhengtai temperament. WALLE is very old, at least 700 years old. But he's not an uncle. Look at those eyes that can move up and down, how cute! When frightened like a small mouse, when the expression of their innocence sparkling, brave when desperate dedication (such as hanging in the spacecraft through the atmosphere to find a girlfriend, such as to protect the girlfriend burned to the brain)...... The most elite women. Many men are afraid of the Wolf before the tiger, fear the right, but also want to hold the beauty, that is wishful thinking.

Maybe she is in charge of a big company but can't make a light bulb, she is in charge of thousands of troops but it is difficult to get some beloved little thing. EWA has high-tech equipment and can make a mushroom cloud with her hand, but when the sandstorm comes, she can only rely on WALLE to hold her hand. . She's come to earth in search of green life, she's been walking on steel, and this thing is in WALLE's treasure chest. In short, you have to make the person you're pursuing want you.
5. You can also create situations where you are in the same boat. By accident, WALLE clumsily makes himself wanted and drags EWA into the water. This put two people on the same boat, contact of course also more, feelings are easy to cultivate.
Above all, be a good man -- even if you don't look like one. Kind-hearted, brave sacrifice, perseverance, adhere to the side of justice... This is the key to WALLE's ultimate success in winning over the beautiful. Of course, if you just enjoy the pursuit and don't want to be with the other person, then your character matters less.",

How can so many people take time out of their lives to give bad 'reviews' for a movie they haven't seen, simply because they got the impression somewhere that it is an ecological screed (which it really isn't)? Do they really think they can disguise their 1 star votes by claiming, ""I really loved the movie but I have to mark it down to level the playing field."" Who do they think they are kidding? If you don't like the idea of this movie being in the IMDb Top 250, then too bad. It deserves its place and was put there by the people who enjoyed this movie. I mean, please stop politicking, it's just a movie! I'm also wondering how on Earth adding dialog (between who is quite another question?) to the first 40 minutes of the movie would do anything other than to devalue the story. If you really need language to explain a story then too bad. Not that words are necessary as the story explains itself anyway. And if your 4/5/6/7/8-year old was bored throughout then you should perhaps question your parenting methods, or figure out beforehand which movies are the dumb ones you can see with car chases and 1-dimensional plots so no thinking is ever necessary. I'm sure you'll agree that there are plenty of films like that to satisfy your simple needs. While you're about it, why not get a map out and see for yourself how far from Hollywood Pixar's offices are. Emeryville is in Silicon Valley, a stone's throw away from San Francisco. That's a 7-hour drive from Los Angeles.",

Ratatouille was marvelous, the perfect film being as appealing to adults as to children. Wall-E on the other hand dumbs-down to be a film where only the visuals can appeal to adults. Finding Nemo was a great adventure, not wrecked by its celebrity voices as are many animated features (or by their obsession with celebrity voices). Wall-E avoids the celebrity voices route but falls down by being an adventure without detail or substance. This one is weak the whole way through after its intro, in contrast with 'Up', which falls down completely after a wonderful opening. A shame in both cases that the flagship company for animated features (their animated shorts are like out-takes only) would go ahead with either of these films that could only be badly flawed.",

Nature of people can change but with using robots we got lazy. It is best animated movie of the year. It is perfect robot story. I advise you to watch it.

I could only watch the first half hour and then had to leave the room and let the kids watch it. I have read all the good and excellent reviews about it and I just don't get it. I haven't seen any good animated films over past few years and I think it's because the animation is being done by computers.

As we wait for a hopeful resurgence next year with such planned epics as Intersteller, Avatar, Battle Angel, Ender's Game, T4, Star Trek and others, we have on our hands a small masterpiece in the form of Pixar's latest and greatest film Wall E. It's been said many times that Pixar would never outdo the incredible Incredibles, at least until Ratatouille came out last year, which many called an even superior work to Bird's previous masterpiece. I can't say I agree with that, but the latest from Finding Nemo director Andrew Stanton has to be up there with the greatest animated films ever created, and indeed, the greatest films in sci-fi cinema's history.",

My wife and I had much the same sentiment, but having dropped 22 dollars to go see it I was determined to stay until the end. Guess I should have trusted my son on this one, because it just turned out to be more of the same ""save the planet"" tripe that keeps getting pushed on us more and more these days. Most of Pixars movies have focused on the main characters struggle to overcome their own short-comings in a way that a child can relate to, and in the end the protagonists are always the better for it. Slapstick and a little adult humor are mixed in and presto, everyone has a good movie going experience. However, this movie just seemed to focus on mankind's general abuse of the planet and overall slothfulness (is that a word?). People weren't redeemed at the end of the movie they were just made to revisit the polluted cesspool of a planet that their predecessors had created. How the group of fat, slovenly, fools that was supposed to be what was left of mankind at the end of that movie would do anything more than get back on their spaceship and sail away I'll never know.

Said and done, I watched it the other night, and the first 10 minutes were pretty good, Wall-E and Eva are lovable characters, no doubt about it. But after that, it went downhill to become just okay, the ""supporting"" characters in Wall-E are just so boring and don't have any personality at all, they aren't likable at all really. And the idea of having the main characters only, communicating with each other by their names and body language didn't make my day at least. No, this certainly wasn't as great as the IMDb users wanted it to be. It's definitely not worth an imdbtop250 place, that's for sure. However, it's an okay/good movie and you'll definitely laugh at Wall-E's wonders, but as for the script goes, I found it to be rather weak.",

So the movie is out, does great and everyone is talking about it and I get a little interested and finally go see it with little or no expectations. Then out of nowhere, 3 minutes into the movie I'm LOVING it. I was thoroughly entertained the entire time, laughing, enjoying myself and totally engrossed in the film. It really was so fun and a real gem. Wall E couldn't have been a cooler, more affable protagonist. I mean this was an adventure movie, love story and sci-fi flic all thrown into one. It just so happened to be animated...and VERY well done I might add. I guess I need to be more open-minded about these animated features because you know what else I loved...Kung Fu Panda.

Mindlessly boring in some parts, while in others nothing more than yet another blaring environmental message hidden beneath child-friendly wrapping, I honestly cannot see how a child could sit through Wall-E without being confused or bored, or how some critics proclaimed this 'the movie of the decade.' Not to say that Wall-E is garbage; it has a few touching moments, such as Wall-E and Eve's beautiful dance through the star-strewn fathoms of the galaxy, the adorable gang of misfit robots running after Walle and Eve, or Wall-E's curiosity regarding Earth's scattered refuse. However, the emotional scenes are few and far apart, while the plot between them is either far over the children's heads, or so ultimately heartless and pointless that one often wishes they could fall asleep.",

Wall-E the robot develops a tendency to love and it blossoms in it more when it sees another female robot arriving on earth, Eva. Whilst Eva and Wall-E are taken away to moon the true reason is known by Wall-E and Eva that some fanatic and evil mastermind humans were responsible for the dying earth. It is then up to Wall-E to show the spoon fed non-moving lazy bum humans to show what actually humans were when they had a life on a beautiful earth. It is a quite sarcastic movie is a slap on the leaders and generals creating warfare all around the globe that they are missing the element of humanity and love which is not a robot's property but a human being's.",

When I first saw this film in middle school, I was practically all over it. I was really into the whole thing of the robots, the sound effects, and the space theme. Auto was quite easily my favorite robot, especially for an enemy. He is voiced by something called Macintalk, which is similar to a computers speech recognizer where it speaks what you've typed either on a PC or a Mac. The story was a bit hard to understand completely (especially since there wasn't much words or sentences spoken in the beginning), but it made more sense after repetitive watching. Wall-E and Eve (or just about any robot for that matter) may not be much on words, but they're both quite lovable enough for characters. Overall, the film is yet another fun and entertaining 3D animated film from the creators from such classics as Toy Story and Finding Nemo.",

The way that Wall-E simply wanted to hold Eve's hand was incredibly touching (and made me and my bf all mushy through the whole movie:). I've read a few reviews stating it's liberal propaganda, which I disagree with. It's not really propaganda if it's true: we are destroying our environment, we are becoming lazy fat-so's, and we do rely far to heavily on computers.

That goes strictly however for the construction of the unlikely relationship between the film's title hero and his romance with E.V.E, a very lively and interesting supporting character. Love will find a way, even if it has apparently left the human species, who have lost themselves amongst material consumerism.

The fact that EVE and Wall-E two ROBOTs were able to feel such emotion for each other and that WALL-E actually and literally went to the edges of the universe just so that he could find and save EVE it just tore me apart on the inside when it looked like wall-e might not make it!If more animated movies were like this i would definitely go see them more often. My little 4 year old brother giggled when he saw WALL-E fly through space with the fire extinguisher, i cried when i saw Wall-E shut down, and we cheered when we saw him reboot!! I really would like to rate this move 1,000,000 out of 10!!! Because i feel that a 10 doesn't do justice to this adorable, mechanical piece of art!",

735,9 January 2009,bkimbrell0,10, WallE (2008),"Every once in a while, a film comes along that has the power to dramatically change the lives of those who take it in, and it becomes a part of their being. These are films that transcend film to become something more; I call them masterpieces. Masterpieces do not come around every year; they can't, because that would defeat the purpose of the label. 2008 was blessed with one such film. It is called WALLE. WALLE is a story that I still find difficult to actually summarize, but here is my attempt. Set in the twenty-ninth century, planet Earth has become a literal garbage dump, a silent, desolate habitat with wind that seems to scream, and massive dust storms of undisclosed origin. For 700 years, one lone robot named WALLE has been staidly doing its job, unaware of the futility of it all, cleaning up the mess the human race left on the once-beautiful planet. The film's opening act, set on this desert planet, ironically ends up being its most beautiful, filled with simple elegance, and completely devoid of conventional dialogue. Enter EVE, a highly advanced robot of the far future on a classified and mysterious search mission, who captivates our human-like title character with her grace. Ultimately, as EVE finds what she is looking for and is prepared to blast off, leaving WALLE alone forever, he realizes that to allow her to leave unaccompanied would be to lose what is most important to him, a chance he will never again see for as long as he remains chained to the Earth.",

Both this movie and 9 are set on an earth that has been killed off, probably more so in 9. But where 9 takes the depressing low road, Wall-E takes the high road. It's cute. The lead robot much like the robot from Short Circuit, revamped for the future age. Even though the movie is showing destruction and how people get covered in their own garage so much it kills everything off, it still does this in a charming way, as Wall-E collects items and even watches musicals and acts them out. He is a robot with a soul, though we aren't sure where it comes from, since we aren't told. Maybe these Wall-Es came with AI, maybe not. ",

774,28 June 2008,sampsoninc916,10," I'm guessing that after people see this, the number of views on Hello Dolly will increase.","I'm guessing that after people see this, the number of views on Hello Dolly will increase. Nevertheless, I had just returned from seeing this and have to say I am impressed. Pixar has made 8 flicks and this is their 9th flick. 5 of those flicks have their own position in the IMDb's list of 250 of the greatest movies ever made. Of course they made 3 bad flicks: A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc., and don't get me started on Cars, even though me and fans of Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends like that movie. Anyway, the visuals for this movie are stunning. I'm a movie maker myself and have to admit I never ever learned how to do 3D animation and visual effects, even though my movies, or episodes, consist of model, blue screen, and computer-generated 2D effects. You can find my production site here at http://www.sampsoninc.com. Pixar, however, excels at this and makes the incredible world of Wall E beautiful. Oh, and the great cinematographer Rodger Deakins worked as a visual consultant on this film. He worked on great films like Assassination of Jesse James, No Country for Old Men, and In the Valley of Elah, all of which contain content that is not for kids because they are R-rated. Now onto the characters. WALL E, the title character, is downright incredible. Such charm and cuteness goes with this robot that it makes you laugh along with his antics. It works best when you are watching this with an audience and not alone. EVE, the lovebird of WALL E, has a futuristic touch to her and does whatever she can to help him out. Both robots turn out to have hearts and feel emotions whenever the script calls for them. The character development between them was done to an all out excellence. The scenes where they are both together you can actually see their personality. I think the major film critics will do better at admiring this flick than me. By and by, Wall E is an instant classic, and this is why today's kids will enjoy growing up with this company because they had the same awesome gig going nonstop for 13 years. I say that because Toy Story was their first flick. Oh, and don't forget to watch Hello Dolly.",
775,21 July 2008,Mattissimplythebest,10, Fluent and Fluid Fun,When sitting in the cinema and allowing the first parts of this film to wash over you there are a number of things that become apparent; the first is that if like me you are a bit of a people watcher then you will find great delight in the idiosyncrasy's and expressions of Wall-E as he goes about his daily chores. It seems a little odd to think of watching a robot building blocks of rubbish relentlessly into high rise towers as a thing of interest but the camera sticks by Wall-E and allows us to engage in the wonder of something very simple and human.,

That night I came to the conclusion that Ratatouille was better. Now I sit in a theater after seeing Wall-e and I'm having to figure out if this film is better than The Shawshank Redemption or Lawrence of Arabia. In short I was conflicted on whether or not Wall-e was the best film I'd ever seen...a question I'm still mulling over at this moment. Wall-e was a phenomenal film about the sense of wonder that comes with the great unknown, human kind in the future based on our life styles now and of course unlikely love. Wall-e had the ability to melt your heart within the first minute of the film and when EvE came in to the picture I was gone...I think I sat on the verge of tears throughout the entire film before shedding during the one particularly beautiful scene in the middle and sobbing by the films climactic end. Not only was it beautiful artistically driven film it was very VERY important. Its satire on Humans laziness and easy manipulation is the best I've seen since Brazil. This film belongs on the shelf next to other important films like Schindler's List and United 93...it is that important. But finally this film touched in me something I've not felt in such a long time...a sense of wonder. Wall-e is a dreamer and a hopeless romantic. He brings out the child in us all and that feeling that there is more than just this feeble existence, there is something more than just living out life...You need to look at the stars and delight in the company of the ones you love.",

I've been watching this movie since I was little and is one of my favorite movies!! I give this movie 10/10 because it's such a funny, heartwarming, and cute movie! Two of my particular favorite parts is when WALL-E is trying to help EVE when she receives the plant and simply ""falls asleep"" until she goes back to AXIOM. And when WALL-E and EVE ""kiss"" and WALL-E learns how much he really loves her. I highly recommend this movie to watch with friends and family! You're guaranteed to laugh and have a great time! 💘😊",

With as little as three words repeated occasionally throughout the entire film (two of them being each others' names), they create more emotion and personality than most actors ever could. PIXAR continues to raise the bar in this genre. The world, the animation, the characters, the story, the music, the humor, the emotion, and design were simply incredible. The films PIXAR creates have a habit of being extremely touching and this one doesn't disappoint. Not once, but TWICE I found myself tearing up. WALLE, EVE, (and MO!) are simply some of the best characters PIXAR's created since Finding Nemo. I can't recommend the film enough and if you only see one movie this summer, make it this one. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and finally sigh...when it's all over.",

But believe me, There is a lot, a lot, a BUNCH MORE in this movie that will leave you enchanted and delighted, I never felt so much magic in my heart after watching a movie (in fact, the last time I felt it, was when I was 7 yo after watching The Neverending Story), so my money was well spent until the very last cent. Very few times, you have a chance to go to the cinema and have the opportunity to laugh, cry, feel thrilled and after wards, take home not only a smile on your face, but also an important message about us, as human beings and as a community in this huge cosmos, a community that everyday gets more alienated and self destructive.

Does everyone just want to jump up on the ""kid-friendly/meaningful-message-embedded-by-necessity"" film bandwagon? I'm sorry, but Disney Pixar has GOT to do much better than WALL-E, with the Toy Story movies, Finding Nemo, and Monsters, Inc. (just to mention a few) to live up to. Yeah, this movie was safe to take my 8-year-old son to--so safe, in fact, that he nearly fell asleep! My son wanted to rate this movie a 1, but since we were able to sit through the whole movie (barely) and not walk out I thought we should be generous. I couldn't stand that feeling of ""This is basically an excruciatingly long, detestable PSA on what we humans are all doing wrong."" And robots having feelings? Please! How overdone is that?! What an incredible waste of resources and talent...the movie was so colorless and bland and BORING, not to mention that there is hardly any dialogue! And more annoyingly, most of the dialogue involved Eve wailing ""WALL-EEEEEE!"" throughout the film. The Axiom scenes were somewhat redeeming, but not enough to compensate for this flop. When I think of Pixar, I think of beautifully vivid colors and scenery, imaginative plots, and endearing characters. WALL-E came up short on all of the above. Hopefully their next flick will be worth watching.",

You can tell that Pixar THOUGHT about what they were creating, as opposed to just thinking about how to make a buck. Funny thing is, they are going to do just that. This is going to be a blockbuster! Instead of filling their movie with snappy, sassy or suggestive one-liners (as virtually every other movie company would have done) Pixar filled it with sweet and simple emotions, conveyed through tiny gestures, eye movements, sighs and vocals. There's virtually no dialogue whatsoever. Don't think for one moment you'll be bored with that, though. You'll be hoping WALL-E can win the girl (robot) and rooting for him all the way!

821,3 June 2012,StephenBurg,8," ""2001 Rip-Off"" is Great","WALL-E is another movie from the emotional ""geniuses"" at PIXAR. The movie is about a lonely trash compactor in the future (who coincidentally looks like the robot from Short Circuit) who sees a female robot and falls in love with. He shows her a plant, then she goes into a deep sleep and is taken into space, where WALL-E follows her and meets dim-witted, obese humans. From then on, the movie pretty much goes down the same way as Stanely Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" does with an environmental message. The opening sequence is great, opening with a song from ""Hello, Dolly"" and setting up the story with little dialogue, which could be boring for some. The animation is great, like PIXAR has a knack for. There is an emotional appeal in this movie. It's not as sad as ""Up"" or the ""Toy Story"" movies or ""Finding Nemo,"" though. If you like animated movies, you might want to watch this. ****/*****",

It is one of the few animation movies that make you think, a thing that the Japanese have long done with their animation, but Hollywood rarely ventured to attempt. Yet it is not a serious ho-hum affair at all, it's sweet, it's endearing & it gives you that same fuzzy feeling that you got after you watched, say Amelie?

Movies should not require A-list actors, senseless dialogue, or overly flashy and/or tacky CGI effects to be considered entertainment. A movie's value should be based on its story and presentation.

It would take a brave man to stand up and argue that there is a greater animation studio than Pixar, over the past 12 years they have delivered nine feature films and on every single occasion have delivered a gem. Even the weaker outputs in their repertoire (most notably 2006's 'Cars') still stand up as fantastic films in comparison with those of their competitors. Every single one of their films has delivered financially and been embraced critically, therefore you may forgive the company for resting on their laurels and playing it safe, but not Pixar, they are risk takers and innovators. WALL-E presents their biggest risk to date, a sci-fi epic with an ecological subtext which is essentially a love story between two robots who do not speak. This is not a film you would expect a major studio to make, in an industry driven by revenues you sense that for any other studio the risk would be too big, but thank you Pixar, for what you have created with WALL-E is pure inspiration.",

I have to add however, that it is not what it is being made out to be. It is a brilliant animated movie, with an inherent message and its heart in the right place, but a Rank 9 on the top 250? I don't think so. It takes more for a movie to be an all round ground breaker, be it direction like Pulp Fiction, acting performances like the Godfather and so on.

The people who managed to escape this dreary scene are orbiting earth in some sort of spaceship, but they are all too fat and too weak to walk or even stand up.

The reviewers who didn't like it REALLY hated it for all the reasons I loved the movie: great story (they were bored and thought it preachy), fantastic characters (they were annoyed by the multiple utterences of ""eva"", ""walle""), stunning visuals (they thought was too bleak), perfect direction (again - they were bored. that 1st 20-30min of no dialog should win an Oscar - just brilliant), mesmerizing score (they didn't comment on this, but man I love Thomas Newman's work. and Andrew Stanton's use of the Hello Dolly songs is just genius). I know that nothing, no film, no proposal, nothing will every get 100% approval, that's just how life works - everyone has an opinion, but when I read some of the negative scathing comments it just makes me wonder who these people are and why they are that way. The Pixar folks tell timeless tales using state of the art technology and good old fashioned creativity. This movie will be a classic 50 years from now, will Kung Fu Panda (as one Yahoo reviewer stated was a superior film)? Shhhhuddder.. Now I know why the US is in the F'ed up state that it is.",

These are the last beings that have any business being allowed to settle on a still fragile and barely recovering Earth.

It's only about once every decade or so that a film breaks out of its genre with the ferocity to be remembered as something more. Braveheart became one of the greatest romances of its generation. Saving Private Ryan, despite its violence, transcended its audience and brought highly charged drama  along with its bullets  to the big screen. It's becoming very rare for me to be able to sink into my seat, put a timer on the day's stress and just get lost in a film, let alone an animated one.

The drawing style is Comic Book Cool, as perfected in the funny comics more than in the superhero books: Everything has a stylistic twist to give it flair. And a lot of thought must have gone into the design of WALL-E, for whom I felt a curious affection. Consider this hunk of tin beside the Kung Fu Panda. The panda was all but special-ordered to be lovable, but on reflection, I think he was so fat, it wasn't funny anymore. WALL-E, however, looks rusty and hard-working and plucky, and expresses his personality with body language and (mostly) with the binocular-like video cameras that serve as his eyes.

Same concept, yet WALL-E is on the complete other end of the spectrum. For all of the reasons we hated Heartbeeps, we now love WALL-E. The two stars are barely humanoids, yet their fantastically subtle gestures are so human that I was once reminded of a mannerism of a friend. The plot is appropriately ecological (we ARE living in the green decade, after all) and much of the script follows that of a traditional children's film. Yet Pixar's unmatched ability to mix unreal visuals with simple, hysterical wit shines through and gives us the greatest masterpiece in the history of animation.

In order for this movie to be qualified as ""good"" I would have to say the plot line would need to be less predictable, create three dimensional characters, and go more in depth with the story.

I am not ashamed in the slightest to say that this film moved me to tears. It caters for adults and children and is a mixture of both light and dark (in places uncommonly dark for a film that essentially is marketed at younger audiences - SPOILER Wall-E perceiving the other dead Wall-E machines on the rubbish site is one particular poignant example). The level of detail brought to this story is astonishing on every level. Not in a very long time have I walked out of the cinema feeling drained from smiling and crying. This really is an important film for our time, not only a demonstration of the progression of computer animation, but also a true story of discovery and love. This gem of a film is the finest film of 2008 so far and certainly one of the most vital films of the 21st century.

But I would recommend this movie for all ages because it will appeal to everyone who's ever been to a land fill, played a Massively Multi-Player Online Role Playing Game, or used a sensor to flush a toilet. For it's also a film that will horrify you and make you laugh all at once. It depicts a very possible future for humanity and, because of this, is probably one of the most important films of the year, if not of the age. There were times when I just sat, mouth agape, in awe at the horrifying nature of things while all manner of goofy adventures occurred on screen. And yes, I can guarantee that this film is still a kid film, since the sensibilities used in it are still aimed, even with such a reaction as I had, at that demographic first and foremost. This will change how you view a recliner and remind everyone who sees it how much danger over consumption really poses to the planet, all the while in a package well made for kids of all ages. I predict this movie will be on the next list of AFI's Top 100 Films of All Time and is a very strong candidate for all awards that deal with film/animation/and the like. This is a film that is well worth the ticket price, even of the most expensive variety. In short, see this film regardless of how old you are and even, if you must choose, over other blockbusters like Iron Man and Batman: The Dark Knight. It's simply that good.",

Worst of all, the viewer is subjected to another apocalyptic view of Earth's future. I went with three girls ages 10-13, all had high expectations after reading the reviews on this site, all of us were very disappointed. ""Cars"" and ""Toy Story"" were much, much better due to better characters, rich voices and abundant (sometimes adult) humor. WALL-E plays like a depressing social documentary at times.

They strive for ambition and doing things no one has ever done before or even try to attempt. Wall-E was no exception. I remember that I first watched this movie when I was a dumb kid, at the time english was not my primary language so I had a hard time understanding anything about any story. But thats when I watched Wall-E. It still baffles me to this day that how much I understood and felt for the characters despite the main characters only being able to speak 1 or 2 words. That was the ambition of pixar, to create a absolute masterpiece with the main characters never speaking a word (I know there are other stories with main characters not speaking but still non of them are as heartfelt as Wall-E). I recently watch this movie again, and I could not stop crying. Wall-E and Eve are absolutely brilliant, they are two characters that were able to form such a heartwarming relationship without ever speaking their emotions. That is what good storytelling is. I could go on so the TLDR is Wall-E is a must watch.",

Though this concept of living outside earth is very common, this movie presented this concept in a new flavor (From a robots perspective). Also, the story is very well written and it can make us emotional. But still there are some scientific problems in this movie. You can't get new plant species from another plant species. You can just genetically modify a plant .So, there is no way human can get new plant species so quickly. Also, from where human starts to get fishes in post apocalyptic earth. Getting a new species requires thousands of years of evolution. Despite these scientific inaccuracies, I loved this movie. This movie has emotional angle and the way this movie shows human's inability to walk due to overdependence on machine is worth praising. So, in short, this movie is ok but there are some scientific mistakes.",

That said, I'm less impressed by the simple and very predictable plot. Pixar/Disney married state-of-the-art visuals with a worn plot line from an early childhood fairy tale.

The story is, for me at least, is not much original, but topic itself had an amazing interpretation.

Inspiration for the authors probably came from this time and our present and not so impossible or unrealistic future. Which is also one of the disturbing things about this film.

933,11 November 2017,mugeshmugee,9, Best ever,"39 years after starting out as nothing more than a special effects division of Lucasfilm, Pixar Studios has made an unparalleled impact on the modern history of animated film; starting with 1995's iconic Toy Story (which was the first feature-length computer-animated film ever), Pixar has revolutionized the animation industry with what has arguably become the 2nd Disney Renaissance, continually putting out innovative, imaginative new works that (almost) always walk that ever-so-fine line between entertaining younger audiences, while still managing to engage older ones, often capturing the hearts of both alike in the process. However, to me, no singular film in their oh-so-rich body of work stands out more than 2008's WALL-E, which is a one-of-a-kind mixture of sumptuously-animated visual storytelling, bold, imaginatively designed science-fiction concepts, and an overall overwhelming sense of wonder and emotion to ensure that, not only is it one of my favorite animated films, it's also just one my favorite FILMS, period.",

944,29 November 2008,imdb-211,10, Simply Astonishing; Truly a Triumph,"Like you didn't know WALL-E was going to be adorable. Pixar has taken a simple idea and built on it. As one crew member put it, ""what would happen if everyone left Earth and forgot to turn off the last robot?"" It's cute, it's fun. It also has some messages to it that you start to realize as it goes on. Consumption, lack of interaction, the importance of social bonding and interaction, environmental issues, etc. If you want to, you can read so much more into this movie. If you don't want to, you can sit back and enjoy a nice little family film. The animation is great. The team at Pixar has done a great job with the nuances of Wall-E's character. For those of you that know your personality quizzes, he's probably a Beaver. Hard-working, curious, organized, cautious. I was torn between a 7 and an 8 on this one. Why would I bust it down to a 7? Because it works off the same old story of lonely guy meeting hot chick and trying to win her love. Combine that with a rehash of love-the-robot Short Circuit-style and it could have been a mediocre to really bad movie. But Wall-E sells it. He raises the bar to an 8. You root for him. They've made him very likable and I'm gullible, so it works on me. The simple comic relief inside this cautionary tale keeps you chuckling at the very least. In fact, he's the only likable character in the movie. The reason I can't give it higher than an 8 is that they seem to have sunk all their energy into creating Wall-E. They didn't do anything to further develop supporting characters. There are other robots and people, but they don't cut it. If a robot can have depth, Wall-E has it.

The opening scenes on earth are, a little odd, but there are lots of guaranteed laughs within, and Wall-e is a truly tremendous character to have been concocted by an animation studio; in deed, thanks to this little robot, for about fifteen minutes, this is probably the finest animated film ever made; it is unique, it is thought provoking, and it gives great promise of what is yet to come; however, what is yet to come is a terrible waste of a great initial idea. The scenes on board the spaceship are at best 'quirky' and the film is weighed down by too many unnecessary characters, several plot devices of absolutely no sustenance, poor scripting, and an hour of film where the same scenes seem to be flashing before our eyes again and again...it really does get monotonous. The last five minutes go someway to undoing the damage, but for all the stunning animation and 'make you think' messages, Wall e never really finds it feet. If only the first half hour had been fleshed out, developed, and not flushed down the toilet in favour of an irrelevant and idiotic 'look at the pretty lights' plot line that takes far too long and never really gets anywhere, we would probably be looking at top 100 material.",

Wall-E is a machine that cleans up garbage by putting a big chunk of garbage into it's little microwave thing, and makes it into a box. People thought that was cute. Not cute to me, but cool. While watching this I really wouldn't have minded to start criticizing the Asian fobs next to me, who were really Asian boyfriends and girlfriends, both disturbingly were sharing their calls of ""awwwwwwwwwwww"" and ""AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW""! That was one thing I didn't enjoy about watching this movie, but it wasn't the movie's fault. Another thing was the robot love and robotic tension in the movie between Wall-E and Eve, who is another robot who is dangerously violent and catastrophic, yet dangerously ""pretty"" to Wall-E. That's when the ""awwwwwwwwwwwwww""!'s started to really annoy me. I don't get any kind of love except human. Animal love, I don't get. Robot love, I still don't get.

He is the last one on the earth and his mission is to tidy up. One Day a Spaceshuttle appears and Wall-E entered it. A big adventure begins with the last humans, a lot of robots, a plant and a pretty love story. The Movie has many funny and affecting scenes. It also convinces with the story and the good depiction of the characters. I recommend watching the movie for everyone who wants to see a beautiful animation movie.",

967,17 June 2020,iccmulan,8, Amazing,"I saw ""WALL-E"" 2 days ago, i've heard nothing about the movie, i just saw the teaser before i left my house. After 5-10 minutes of the movie, i realized it's something else.",
968,24 July 2008,eyal_kremer2,10," So original, so special, so beautiful :-)","WALL*E is a true masterpiece. I won't reveal any part of the story, but I will say the story is touching, at times funny, at times heart-breaking, and overall extremely remarkable. WALL*E himself is an adorable creature, the kind of person who needs others but can't have them, and that situation is tragic in a way but has potential for a heart-warming story.",
969,7 July 2008,computerwhiz39,10, Among the best Pixar films ever!,"Its Saturday and its very hot so me,my older brother,and my little sister decides to go watch Wall E.
