0,15 October 2021,peach007,9, My favorite movie of the 2010's,"What can I say. This is such a great movie. I remember seeing this for the first time, not really knowing what it was about. Straight from the first scene, it immediately put a smile on my face, which lasted about for the rest of the entire movie. Great entertainment, I love over the top movies like this. I haven't seen something this good since Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I have seen it about 4 times again since it came out and I just keep loving it. The only downside was maybe the scene with the ludes and the Lamborghini. Even though it was great, maybe it was a bit too much over the top :)",/
1,29 December 2020,karolin-99263,10, Oscar worthy,"The movie Leonardo DiCaprio should have gotten an Oscar for. His portrayal of the character is perfect. The movie is well-written, leaving no details out of the original story. Martin Scorsese never fails to impress. One of the only example where the movie is better than the book. The movie never gets boring, I could watch this anytime.",r
2,4 October 2018,nogodnomasters,9, SELL ME THIS PEN,"Golden Globe winner Leonardo DiCaprio stars in the title role of Jordan Belfort. Belfort works his way up the ladder making money in penny stocks, i.e. ""selling garbage to garbage men."" His scheme is to sell these garbage stocks to rich investors due to the high commissions. Along the way he does some illegal transactions as he runs his corporation like a frat party in ""Animal House."" Having not known money, he and his crew are ill equipped to handle it.",e
3,18 June 2014,kosmasp,9, It really is a comedy,"There is a reason this is called Wolf of Wall Street and not Lion of Wall Street. This is not supposed to be a story about some good guy or misunderstood guy doing things that are a little off. And therefor it was important to make this a comedy. When I watched it, I didn't think it would qualify as comedy. Thought of it more of a drama with some comedic moments thrown in.",v
4,24 December 2013,BrentHankins,9, DiCaprio gives the best performance of his career.,"In the mid-1990s, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) and the rest of his associates from brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont became the very definition of excess and debauchery, their offices a boiler room fueled by cocaine and greed. High pressure sales tactic and less-than-legal behind-the-scenes manipulation bred plenty of twenty-something millionaires, and Belfort built himself an empire at the top of the heap. His rise and fall is chronicled in The Wolf of Wall Street, based on the memoir of the same name.",i
5,24 October 2018,notoriousCASK,9," ""Money is the oxygen of capitalism and I wanna breathe more than any other human being alive.""","It's no surprise that Scorsese is associated with the gangster genre with films such as The Departed, Goodfellas and Casino, of which the last two are possibly the best pure examples of the genre. In Goodfellas the gangsters are dangerous but they operate on a more underground level, in Casino they practically run a major city and can do whatever they like. The gangsters were and will always be a part in America's system. Now, the gangsters are not just accepted by the system, but are considered to be an integral part of it. In the first two films, the gangster is threatening and dangerous, but avoidable. In The Wolf of Wall Street, he's calling to hustle you at home and you don't even know it. Some people view The Wolf of Wall Street as a glorification of Jordan Belfort's lifestyle and want to be like him, as Scorsese portrays this life by its nature, enticing. That's the way it works, and it's impossible to portray it accurately without showing how a charismatic man like Belfort can suck an unsuspecting person into a world of money and fame. The film though, shows us just how empty and destructive that life can be.",e
6,22 September 2021,diegocoda,10, The best movie of 2013,"The movie is just the best, the acting is great and even I say that it was Oscar-worthy and the plot is simply one of the best ones; the message that it brings to you that money brings power and it is not always for the best because in this movie we see the downfall of a man that will learn that actually in life the money can be a drug and will simply make you cause damage to yourself.",w
7,17 December 2013,ClaytonDavis,9, The Wolf of Wall Street is Leonardo DiCaprio's Crowning Work,"Martin Scorsese has done it again. His newest and most refreshing effort he's contributed to the world of cinema in years, The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring thrill ride that is both absolutely hilarious and meticulously constructed. It also presents Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio in possibly his finest acting performance of his career. At one-minute shy of three hours, I was both engaged and hypnotized nearly the entire duration. A comedic epic that studies the behavior and cultures of a time in America, feels like the uncovering of a time capsule that was buried and dug up to give insight into our current financial crisis. Much more than just laughs, it turns on the dramatic elements early enough in the film to warrant considerable reactions about the choices of our key characters. Expertly paced with intelligent moral questions presented, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best films of the year.",/
8,12 April 2021,abdulazizalsaad-73053,10, Leo's best performance of all time!!,"Di caprio was robbed in the oscars whether you like it or not, the only reason why people give this movie a low rating is because of the over nudity, and it's the same reason why leo didn't get the oscar in my opinion, which is what I don't understand!!!, it's an r rated movie, so obviously there will be nudity, it's not a kid's movie!!!! , it's easily leo's best performance and scorcese's second best movie after goodfellas.",r
9,29 December 2013,Al_The_Strange,9, Wolf of Wall Street review,"If you've seen The Goodfellas or Casino, then you'll know the story of The Wolf of Wall Street. This is another tale of a criminal whose ambitions sweep him away into a debauched world of dirty money, out-of-control substance abuse, endless lies, a troubled family life, and a downward spiral of corruption that inevitably leads to his own undoing. Only thing is, this is less about the gangsters and mafia, and more about white-collar crime. The guys wear suits, work in proper offices, and everything they do is just business; funnily enough, this whole movie still plays out like a kind of gangster film.",w

12,15 November 2021,alexscott-35299,10, This is easily Leo's best performance ever!,"This movie is absolutely amazing and it deserved way more Oscar wins. Leonardo DiCaprio is unbelievable and this movie is his best performance and he isn't the only one putting in an amazing performance, this film is littered with them, Jonah Hill is amazing, Margot Robbie is so good to say this was her first major role. I love the story that this movie is telling and the direction on how they tell it is amazing aswell. This is easily one of the best movies of all time and it will go down in history as one of Leo's best ever movies. I love it so much!",6

14,26 March 2014,michaelRokeefe,8, Other people's money. High life of a stockbroker.,"Martin Scorcese magnificently directs this wild, funny and somewhat repugnant story based on Jordon Belfort's own tome. A bit long, but it is the most interesting and fast moving three hours you'll spend. An outstanding cast surrounding Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort, a Long Island stockbroker that masterminded a massive securities fraud in the 1990s. This film depicts Belfort being a self-made man; albeit through partying hard, self over-medicating, no holds barred debauchery leading to his whirlwind approach leaving a mark on Wall Street. Belfort's charisma being able to attract followers in sharing his use of other people's hard earned money to live a life of beautiful women, exotic drugs, lavish homes and cars, and the utmost luxury making for a lush life. A master at scamming so well, he is a loud flaunting target for the FBI. It gets hard snitching on your closest friends, But Belfort manages to use the chance to garner a smaller stint in prison...36 months.",0

18,1 January 2014,mm-39,5, over hyped movie!,"Martin Scorsese is losing his gift as a director. The Wolf of Wall Street is another rendition of Scorsese's other movies. The narration, actions, and flow of Wolf of Wall Street is similar to Goodfellas, Casino and Mean Streets. Di Capiro's lead character is just another version of the Henry Hill character from the movie Goodfellas. Through the streetwise narration of Di Capiro one learns how the system is scammed, and experiences dysfunctional behaviour of drugs, and prostitutes. The characters lack of morals creates the usual drama stew of low lives. Scorsese tries to spice up the old recycled formula with nudity, massive drug use, over the top sex, which can not compensate for the lack of story depth. 3 hours was way too long for a half hour story. Five stars out of ten.",?
19,21 January 2014,Theo Robertson,8, Goodfellas Meets Wall Street Meets Biting Black Comedy,""" The business of America is business "" screams an old cliché but like so many clichés it's based on reality . Is there much difference between a gangster and a stockbroker ? It's the sign of a very poor mobster who can't make a profit for his firm and it's the same with the stock market . Thankfully capitalism is legal and every other socio-economic alternative has been a disaster for humanity but one can't help equating the stock exchange with being the same as gangsterism , supply and demand without any moral or humanitarian mores and one wonders how American auteur Martin Scorsese might bring a story of Wall Street to screen ? If there's a problem with Scorsese he sometimes remakes the same type of film as in THE KING OF COMEDY and BRINGING OUT THE DEAD are remakes of TAXI DRIVER . likewise GOODFELLAS was remade as CASINO .One can't help thinking the temptation to make a story featuring an amoral capitalist could quite easily end up becoming a gangster film set in the world of high finance . "" All my life I wanted to be a white collar criminal "" ",r
20,25 December 2013,aharmas,1, Loud and Flat Failure,"De Caprio is the heart of the film, a daredevil whose motivation seems to be a misguided desire to acquire as much money as possible. He lives his life as a constant dare, using and abusing the investments of others, gambling with his personal relationships and his own health. He constantly endangers his life and those who are closest to him. It seems like he is capable of stopping this fall, but he keeps sinking and sinking. We could say he has a survivor's nature, but he carries with a very intense death wish, too.",e
21,18 June 2014,ironhorse_iv,7," The Wolf of Wall Street was a pretty crazy movie. Not, only did it sell the pen. The dark comedy concept sold the movie.","If this movie wasn't so outrageous mess up funny. It would be so unlikable to watch. In my opinion, should had been call, 'The Wolves of Wall Street'. Nobody has any morals balls in this movie as every character in this film is pretty greedy liars. They all felt like one-dimensional greed caricatures than human beings. Most of the character really need more well-rounded depth to them. Based on 2007's memoirs, true story of Jordan Belfort. The movie focus on Jordan (Leonardo DiCaprio) rise to a wealthy stockbroker through the use of corruption scams; while under the watchful eyes of the federal government in the 1990s. The black comedy directed by Martin Scorsese, is pretty well-made. Still, it really felt too much of a glamorization of the lifestyle, than a moral tale, in my opinion. It felt like lets show as much f*ck up things as we can for 2 hours, and then in the last few minutes, show the negative results of what happen. It was bit one-sided argument. It made the film seem a bit unrealistic, with how many crude things, these people could get away with. This movie will likely inspiring others to do the same mistakes, rather than teach them, not to do what Belfort did. After all, the real Belfort got paid for this movie, a million dollar and a cameo. Since 2013, the opening of this movie, Belfort hasn't pay enough money back to the victims of his crimes. The U.S. government is not holding Belfort in default of his payments, but it is unclear when the full amount of the mandated restitution will ever be paid by him. He's pretty much, got Scot free in his case, and that really sucks to hear, if he stole money from you. The acting is really alright. Leonardo DiCaprio can really put out the charm. He can also do the yelling, that he been known for. He wasn't afraid of going over the top with this. Still, this role wasn't anything new for him. After all, he played similar characters in both 2013's Great Gatsby and 2002's Catch Me if you can. Instead of playing it straight, he just went 100% crazy with this role with all the sex scenes and drug use. Honestly, with all the drug use, Jordan portray in the film doing, how is this guy even alive? The one person that deeply surprise me was Jonah Hill as his partner in crime, Donny Azoff. You really didn't see this type of acting coming from him. The supporting cast was pretty good for the most part. I have to say, while his premise on film is short, Matthew McConaughey as Mark Hanna, Jordan's mentor, was pretty memorable. The women characters were pretty typecast as trophy wives, money hungry girlfriends, or eye candy hookers, who mostly go around, full frontal nudity, or having sex. If they're not, doing that, they portray as bitchy gold-diggers with no sense of morals. Margot Robbie is a pretty face, but gees, she couldn't act. At the beginning of her presence, she had an Australian accent that made more sense since her aunt is British. Then,out of the blue, you hear this awful screeching New Yorker/New Jersey Guido accent that sounds like something out of Jersey Shore. She couldn't show depth in her character, if Martin Scorsese wanted to. It's really uncomfortable and offended how women were portray in the film. The only female character was somebody to root for, was Aunt Emma (Joanna Lumley), but she ain't no angel. I have to say, for men, at less, we got a counter-protagonist fighting against the antagonist Jordan in Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) who did wonderful in his role. He wasn't one-dimensional pencil pusher, Boy Scout. He was willing to go one on one with Jordan. The movie even have a somewhat moral character in Jordan's father, Max (Rob Reiner) who tries hard to get Jordan to live life, the right way, but always his son to make the mistakes, needed to grow. I love the idea, how Martin Scorsese film it, with the use of wide ends, slow motion and others to show the effects of the drugs or heavy party scenes. The movie really felt like it could had work in a 3D settling. I love how he aged the film for the infomercial sequence to make it look like something that came out in the 1990s. I love all the commercials footage used from Benihana to Steve Madden. The CGI in the film is a bit choppy. You can see, how bad, it was in the storm scenes, but there is rare mistakes made this film. Great use of establish music to set the mood of the film. The humor is a hit or miss. Some of them were really just crude like the homophobic, sexism and racism comments. While, others were pretty clever and funny. I love all the fourth wall jokes with Jordan gives lengthy explanations of Stockbroker terminology; only to drop it midway through. I love pop culture references like Moby Dick, Gordon Gekko, Freaks, James Bond, Willy Wonka and others. The movie had a cluster F-Bomb with 544 uses of the word. Some of them seem natural; while other seem oddly place. This film has the record for the most uses of the word in a fiction film. The movie is 3 hours long with its pacing. You can't really tell, with the pacing, due to not a lot of slow scenes. Still, there were few gags did go on way too much. You can cut the movie to 1hr and 30 minutes, and get the same results. I was deeply surprised, that this movie wasn't NC-17 with its strong sexual content, graphic nudity, drug use and language throughout, and for some violence. It's one of the movies that should be. Overall: Well-made movie that was kinda offended, but still watchable.",f
22,24 June 2021,lopezpatricia-06139,1, Totally disgusting and annoying,To illustrate I'm no prude I confess I've prob done more drugs that the lot of em. But this film was disgusting. Doing hookers in front of everyone the absurd frat boy raucous testosterone fuelled crap. This film annoyed me from the first five mins to the bitter end. You don't need to be of a sensitive disposition for this film to offend you as it's so extreme it put my debauched life into a shadow. Ugh just ugh.,_
23,31 December 2013,zetes,8," Hugely entertaining, if a little long","Martin Scorsese redoes Goodfellas in the financial sector. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort, a young man immediately smitten with the ruthlessness of Wall Street (at first represented by Matthew McConaughey in a hilarious cameo). After the market sees a startling crash in the late '80s, DiCaprio gets pushed out of the big leagues. He quickly finds a way in smaller markets, pushing penny stocks. He figures out ways, not all of them strictly legal, to make cash hand over fist. Soon, paired with new best friend Jonah Hill, he opens his own firm. All the rules go out the door as he pulls in millions of dollars a year, which leads to all sorts of drug-fueled mayhem. The draw here is the pure debauchery. It will surely offend some, but the pure spectacle of depravity is enormously amusing. The film really doesn't want to think too hard about the awful things that Belfort is doing, which is kind of a bold choice. Sure, he does end up suffering in the end, but, with all he experienced beforehand, the little bit of suffering seems almost worth it. It could easily be argued that it's a hugely immoral film, but I think it just wants to put us in the action. The film has an epic runtime, which isn't really deserved. I wasn't exactly bored with it (though I was feeling it physically), but it could have been shortened. DiCaprio gives one of his best performances, but I was most amused by Hill. Many will despise his abrasive character, but I thought he was hilarious.",=
24,29 December 2013,lee_eisenberg,10, Greed reigns supreme!,"Martin Scorsese must be a director who can't make a bad movie. Most of his movies have focused on streetwise lowlifes, and so now he looks at a different kind of lowlife: the Wall Street kind. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is the true story of stockbroker Jordan Belfort. Having come of age in the '80s, Belfort was convinced that there was nothing wrong with greed, and so he stopped at nothing to get what he wanted. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Belfort as an amoral slimeball leading a hedonistic, frat boy lifestyle: drugs, booze, hookers, the whole shebang. And yet the whole thing is very funny.",t

27,28 December 2021,cricketbat,4, At what point does a movie about deplorable debauchery become deplorable debauchery?,"One of the many reasons The Wolf of Wall Street didn't sit right with me is that I couldn't tell what it was trying to say. It seemed to glorify what Jordan Belfort and his cohorts did instead of condemning it. And at some points, the movie that was trying to tell us about deplorable debauchery became deplorable debauchery itself. It's an interesting story featuring good acting, but overall it's just kind of disgusting.",u

32,3 June 2016,jacobjohntaylor1,1, popular for no reason,There are great actors in this movie. The story line is awful. The characters are awful. This is the boring life story of a crook from wall street. Why do we care. So what if it is real. It is boring. It is not an 8.2. It is one of the worst crime dramas ever. A movie best on a true story can be good. This is not one of then. To many people like movies just because they are best on a true story. It does not matter that the writing stinks. Good actors wasted there time being in this awful movie. Do not waste your money. Do not waste your time. Do not see this awful movie. Bad movie bad movie bad movie. I need more lines and I am running out of things to say.,
33,24 January 2014,neil-476,8," Good, but morally queasy","Jordan Belfort can do two things extremely well: sell, and teach others to sell. Setting up his own stock brokerage, he proceeds to make vast amounts of money, which he then takes immense pleasure in spending on property, cars, trophy wife, sex and drugs. Lots of drugs. However, the facts that he is not concerned about the morality or legality of how he makes his money attracts the attention of the FBI. First of all, this is a film not to see if you object to nudity, sex, drug use or bad language on screen, because there is a great deal of all these things in this film. Seriously, if this stuff upsets you, stay away.",
34,3 February 2014,siderite,7," Even when you have everything, you still want more","It is difficult to watch a movie that you absolutely know how it will end. Scorsese is known for casting Leo diCaprio as the young energetic underdog that gets the world, only to lose it wholesale. The other movies of this sort, though, were interesting because they featured the criminal underworld or some other bizarre and exotic environment. The Wolf..., in comparison, is a movie about spammers and thieves that get drunk and high all the time in order to keep up with their own fantasies about their lives. Really, you could make it about Romanian hackers and it would have been a much better and fun film, with the same general ideas.",

37,21 June 2015,inframan,1, Gangs of New York updated...,"There was a real opportunity here to make a powerful statement as well as a highly entertaining film but it got completely thrown out by the director & author of the screenplay. Instead of a stinging indictment and/or satire of Americann greed & lust we get an over- the-top presentation of sex & drugs as male pre-pubescent fantasy. Everything the average 13 year-old imagines his future to be. Not surprising given that the director Martin Scorsese gives the majority of his films the same blockbuster treatment: everything short of singing & tap dancing. The only other director using a similar approach is Baz Luhrman. Interesting that Dicaprio starred in this movie & Gatsby in the same year, highly miscast in both. Casting him is understandable: he's likable & cute & popular with the mainstream movie-going public. Here he basically replicates his performance in Catch Me If You Can. I don't say he's a bad actor, just wrong for the part. Here he reminds me of Bob Hope in something like Monsieur Beaucaire: likable but clueless as to what makes the character he's playing tick. Years ago there was a TV series called Profit in which Adrian Pasdar perfectly depicted a similar character. Ah well, gotta go for the biggest-paying demographic, I guess.",

39,23 January 2020,Ch4ndler_B1ng,10," ""Literally A **** Ton of Money""","Let's just start of by saying, why didn't Martin win oscar for best director and picture of the year, obviously Leo should've won for best actor and a leading role and Margot Robbie definitely should've won best supporting actress. This is a very fun ride, my sides were aching from all my laughter, the comedy is consistent throughout the whole movie, definitely my favorite film of the decade (no doubt). Jonah Hill's first role that made me realise this man can act, he is hilarious and adds to the film's greatness. The sex scene between Naomi and Jordan is comedy at its' peak, Margot has my favorite female performance of all time. SPOILER TIME: There's a great scene where Jonah Hill's character meets Jordan, claims that he lives in his apartment with two kids and the ""ugly wife"" and this sets up his character, from then on he's absolutely brilliant. One scene which made me laugh so hard I coughed was when Jordan deals with the side effects of ludes and jeez is this scene excellent.",

46,19 January 2014,tomgillespie2002,8, 3 hours of utter depravity. And it's hilarious.,"Boasting the fifth collaboration between lauded director Martin Scorsese and can-do-no-wrong A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio, The Wolf of Wall Street signals the moment the two finally took the step over the brink. Their previous films together - Gangs of New York (2002), The Aviator (2004), The Departed (2006) and Shutter Island (2010) - were all solid, if hardly groundbreaking works. With The Wolf of Wall Street, Scorsese seems to have let go of his reservations and embraced the daring, X- rated innovations of his 70's and early 80's work, and DiCaprio deserves to look smug after giving his finest performance to date. From the opening shot of DiCaprio snorting cocaine from between a prostitute's open legs, this is 3 hours of utter depravity. And it's hilarious.",

Okay, I get it. There are people who will do anything for money and who are morally bankrupt. This is Hollywood meets soft porn when soft porn has already been killed off by one-click-accessible porn. I'm not a puritan. This is just an objective fact. We live in the Age of Pornography. I, therefore, don't understand why Scorsese thinks this is the 'shocking' lens he should use to educate us on the evils of Wall Street greed and excess, unless he hopes to drag in the teenage boy audience, in which case, it simply amounts to pandering. In the end, I felt that it was Scorsese himself who was morally bankrupt. I think it is time for him to reassess his career. No great film was ever made so by pandering to base instincts. Great films stand on the strength of fundamental truths about human nature that leave the viewer leaving the theater uplifted, inspired, or awakened to elements of human nature in some way. This does not mean all movies have to have happy endings. The knowledge one takes from a good film can force one to reassess their values or ideas and this can be a difficult experience. But there is nothing fundamentally challenging about this film. Even if you try to think of it as a sort of documentary, it falls flat.",

58,30 December 2013,cultfilmfan,1, The Wolf of Wall Street,"The Wolf of Wall Street, which is Martin Scorsese's new film based supposedly on a true story and book by Jordan Belfort, is not only the single worst film I have seen in 2013 so far, but it is also one of the worst films that I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through. The film sounded interesting enough as I have an interest in wall street and the business world and more times than not I have enjoyed Martin Scorsese's films and Leonardo DiCaprio as well as their collaborations together, but this film just did not work. First off, I think that this is one of the most vulgar and profane films that I have ever seen. I would actually be curious to know how many profanities were uttered during the course of this film because it must have been an awful lot because there was barely a minute that went by without someone cursing. Besides the filthy language and lots of it, the film showed the lifestyles these characters lived and showed in graphic detail all the immoral and perverse things that they were up to. Basically this was the whole of the film, showing a bunch of spoiled an arrogant rich people behaving badly with no real message, or anything to wrap the film up with. The film was just endless excess and then some. I have seen a lot of films over the years including some that have objectionable content of varying degrees and styles and usually unless it is done in a certain way, I do not let it bother me, but for The Wolf of Wall Street, it felt like there was no point to it and the whole objective of this film was to be loud, crude, rude and vulgar. To be honest I am shocked the film did not receive an NC-17 rating. I guess I was not the only person to have felt this way because people actually left during the screening I was in for this movie and I read that during an official screening of the film with cast and crew, someone actually went up to Scorsese and said ""Shame on you!"". I wish I could have said the same thing right to his face. This is the type of film that I absolutely hated so much that I wish my friend, who very kindly paid for the tickets for the movie, would have asked for his money back because this film was almost 3 hours of my life that I will never get back, 3 hours I could have spent doing something better, or seeing a much better film. I am personally really surprised at the high ratings the film is getting and also all the awards nominations as well. Did they see the same film I did? To me though, there was nothing that made this film special at all. Every single character was loathsome, so to say I admired the acting would be hard for me to say, seeing as I did not care about any of these characters and after awhile they got on my nerves and I just wanted the film to be over. The film's screenplay was just excessive bad behaviour and wild living with no moral, or point to it, other than just showing it and going as far as they can with the content and hoping that the audience has a wild and fun time with it, which I didn't. Also the film was way too long. At almost 3 hours in length sitting through this monotonous and vulgar bore was actually painful. I sat and squirmed in my seat and wished for better lighting in the theatre, so that I could check my watch to get a rough idea of when this piece of trash would be over. Alas, I sat patiently and this film would just not end. The editing was all over the place and there were scenes in this film that had no point of being in there and others just went on for way too long. The film is being classified as a comedy, but I do not think I laughed once. Often it's attempt at humour, or trying to make me laugh was just scenes that I found awkwardly executed and filmed and they looked clumsy and poorly done. The whole film felt like it was made during a college fraternity party and written and made after everybody had probably way too much to drink. This is certainly a major disgrace for Martin Scorsese, the man behind such classics as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. I didn't think with all his talent that he could make a film this bad, but he proved me wrong. Unfortunately, people are going to go and see this film and probably kick a big kick out of it for all the wrong reasons. I will certainly throw a fit if this wins any major awards over much better and deserving films this year though. As it stands, The Wolf of Wall Street is a film that I hope to never see ever again in my whole life and it was a rare occasion where I saw a film where I wanted a complete refund from the theatre chain. The absolute worst film of 2013 and don't make the same mistake I did by paying, or sitting through it.",
59,4 June 2022,david-meldrum,7," Much That's Good, But Leaves The Wrong Kind Of Taste Behind","An accusation that can be convincingly levelled at Scorsese, especially in his weaker moments, is that he wants to have his cake and eat it. Is he celebrating, lampooning, or critiquing alpha masculinity... or is he doing some combination of all three? In the later part of his career this film is the prime example of that - I'm never quite sure where he lands, and I don't think he truly is either. There's some brilliant performances; and one scene between Margot Robbie and DiCaprio towards the end is genuinely upsetting. But the relentless, frenetic pace of much of the previous three hours does seem to dwarf that; not to mention what comes after it. Three hours of that pace of editing and that volume of sound is just too much; and there seems to be a bit too much comedic enjoyment gained from morally reprehensible behaviour to convince the film is sufficiently nuanced. Not to say there isn't plenty to admire and enjoy - but by Scorsese's standards this leaves the wrong kind of taste in the mouth.",

I sincerely hope that he had a few sober moments in the late 80's and early90's where he accomplished something good, he doesn't seem to remember any of it. Most recovering addicts that I have met have tried to honestly reflect their past and turn away from it. Mr. Belfort has found a new drug in reveling in the hangover of his past.

He was indicted for fraud in 1998 and was sentenced for a relatively lenient 22 months in prison. The amoral, drug addicted Belfort is played by Leonardo Di Caprio (this is his fifth film for Scorsese); Jonah Hill is Belfort's main sidekick, Donnie. The Australian actress Margot Robbie is great as the blond bombshell - dumb model - trophy second wife of Belfort. Rob Reiner has an unnecessary extended cameo as Belfort's father. Though the subject matter is certainly interesting and the acting is fine, this film, despite its undeniable brio, is also quite unpleasant with its three hour non stop show of drug use and sordid sex. The movie is very repetitive: we see sex, drug use, a joke involving oral sex, sex, drug use, etc. Moreover, the movie has no characters one can sympathize – everybody is extremely unpleasant (well, maybe with the exception of the FBI agent played by Kyle Chandler, but he appears in the screen for only a little time).

A scumbag's rise and fall and return to despicable life of greed, conceit and moral void. Scorsese and DiCaprio revel with the revelers in this flick to show...actually for an unknown reason. There is no moral reference point in the film, rather a neutral excitement about the cunning of the main character. There is not one good or sympathetic person depicted in this film. All are scumbags with no hope or desire for any form of redemption, remorse or a lasting human feeling. Very dark and depressing movie; actually misanthropic.

Who paid off whom to get this an ""R"" rating? I'm angry with those who call this art.

I admit it's a fun-filled ride throughout, and it never gets boring. But after a certain point, the narration, the jokes and the parties get monotonous. For such a long movie, the character-development and character-exploration is very poor, and there are so many characters and scenes which don't have any special relevance or importance in the whole story being told. I can't believe it's Terence Winter (from 'The Sopranos' and 'Boardwalk Empire') who wrote the script. The main distraction while watching a biopic like this is that the things shown on screen (fabulous office parties, amount of drugs each of the them take within a day, their ability to function properly in such high, the money lavishly spent around, and so many other things) always make you wonder how much of it is accurate and how much of it is complete exaggeration; you don't get a clear picture of the people and lifestyle of that place and era.",

DiCaprios acting is undeniably good, he's being growing up as an actor for many years and he has made very clear that he can make a movie good on his own, and this is one of those cases. The support actors are good in their roles (especially the short but excellent part of McConaughey) but the irreplaceable here is Di Caprio, he steals the show. Not much more than a showcase of fun events involving a group of drug addicts enjoying excess in every way possible, and how they go to hell for what they do.

94,24 May 2014,leonblackwood,8, A Great Watch! 8/10,"Review: I really enjoyed this epic movie which keeps you on the end of your seat from beginning to end. Although the film is about serious issues, there is some really funny scenes, especially between DiCaprio and Hill who had great chemistry. The storyline goes from one extreme to the next, which is what made it hard to believe that it was based on a true story. The amount of money that the traders go through is ridiculous and the whole care free attitude had to come to a halt at some point. At nearly 3 hours long, the director done well to keep the movie interesting and a joy to watch. I never thought that I would say this, but it is in the same class as the original Wall Street which was a tough act to follow. A Great Watch!",

Very little that we as movie goers have not already seen 100 times before and nothing that I necessarily needed to sit through 168 minutes to see again. ",

If it is not the worst film I have ever seen, that makes it all the more shameful: People with talent allowed themselves to participate in this travesty. Disgusted and unspeakably depressed, I walked out of the film..."" That's Roger Ebert on ""Caligula"", a man who rarely walked out of films. Put together by the publisher/pornographer Bob Guccione, the graphic and elaborate orgies in ""Caligula"" featured A-list talent: Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud, and Helen Mirren. One difference separating these two cinematic debaucheries - upon release everyone connected with the film disavowed it, and Gore Vidal, after seeing it, sued to have his name taken off it. (He wrote the original screenplay.) It seems everyone connected with ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is standing proudly by it. Many better critiques of capitalism have been made about selling out. Just a few: ""The Devil's Advocate"", ""Glengarry Glen Ross"", ""The Boiler Room"", ""The Social Network', ""Wall Street"", ""Trading Places"", ""Risky Business"" and ""Blow"". And then there's the incomparable ""O Lucky Man!"" by Lindsay Anderson, another allegory about the pitfalls of capitalism. And oddly enough, it stars the star of ""Caligula"", Malcolm McDowell. And Helen Mirren too. Inspired by ""Candide"", McDowell's character, Mick Travis, experiences a moral revelation at the end. (As does Kevin Lomax in ""The Devil's Advocate"".) Jordan Belfort? No revelations of any sort, moral or otherwise. And no revelations for the audience as well. As Ebert wrote of ""Caligula"", shameful.",
99,6 January 2014,luci1977,1, Don't waste your time,I've always thought that there must be a very good reason for a movie to last 3 hours. Wolf of wall street does last 3 hours but there no shadow of a good reason for it. It could have lasted 1 hour and it would have been already too long.,
100,26 March 2020,aidanratesmovies,10, Fantastic,"With some fantastic acting, clever writing, and as always brilliant direction from Scorsese, The Wolf of Wall Street shines. Leonardo DiCaprio leads an all out cast in one of, if not, the best performance of his career. Jonah Hill also gives a fantastic performance, as well as Margot Robbie and even smally from Matthew McConaughey. The film is shot with great style and care, and there is no doubt it is one of the best crafted films of the decade. The film is full of humor, heartbreak, and can be at times surprisingly exciting. The film does seem to go on a bit too long for certain scenes, but even with the 3 hour runtime, the film is still able to be massively entertaining. Shining with every frame and taking action every chance it gets. In the end, The Wolf of Wall Street may be a long journey to sit through, but it is far more than worth it. It bubbles with atmosphere and excitement. It's funny, entertaining, and by all means an absolute blast.

102,28 December 2013,worldofgabby,3," Good for adolescent boys, I guess.","I didn't like Wolf of Wall Street for a number of reasons. It was very repetitive and ultimately boring. How many times can one watch people snort coke, get drooly on Quaaludes, and have sex with prostitutes? How many smooth-skinned blondes with shaved privates are enough, and how many times do we have to watch mindless machismo and bonding? After the third or fourth scene of juvenile debauchery the excesses of the central characters become mind-numbingly dull. I recognized many attempts to inject a little of the magic of Goodfellas into the proceedings, which made me wish I was watching it instead of Wolf of Wall Street. Don't get me started on the film's attitude towards women (even aside from the aforementioned prostitutes.)The movie had a bit of humor, especially towards the end, but the characters were not developed and many chances to deepen the movie were missed. The movie came alive only in a few scenes, usually ones accompanied by music. It made me sad to see a director I admire making such a hash of it, and reputable actors trying valiantly to turn two dimensions into three.",
103,9 February 2015,pefrss,1," This must be the most misogynist , vile movie in a long time","When the Wolf of Wall Street was in the movie theaters I read the reviews and decided that I did not need to see it. Recently I developed an interest in seeing more movies with Jean Dujardin in it after I saw a movie called Moebius . I had also seen The Artist, but nothing else with him. So I searched on IMDb which other movies Jean Dujardin had made and found that he had a part in the Wolf. I took the Wolf of Wall Street out at the library (thanks for that, so at least I did not have to pay for that trash) and when I started to watch it I remembered why I did not want to see the movie in the first place. I have to admit that I fast forwarded through it because there is a limit of how many times I want to hear the f word, or watch a bad dye job on Di Caprio or see unsexy naked prostitutes. I get that Scorsese want ed to paint the guy as repulsive and he was successful in doing so, but three hours of repulsive without anything interesting happening is just too much. It also reminded me never to wear anything from famous designers again because that would put me in the company of sleaze balls. When I see movies like this the only fear I have is that some young stupid impressionable person may actually think that this kind of life is a good thing. Otherwise I can only recommend this movie to women, You will never want to be with a man who drinks or takes drugs again after watching that and you will never trust your man going on a business trip again. I live in Las Vegas and I have heard from people working in the big hotels that they have to take the hose to some rooms which have been used by immature drunk males on drugs, but I highly doubt that any airline would allow their customers to behave like these pigs. I did not need to see this movie to know that this kind of men are lousy lovers and husbands. There was really nothing I liked and again I realize that this was the intention. . It was no fun to watch, I have not learned anything new. I thought that DiCaprio was too old for the role and the hair and eyebrow dye job was so distracting that I was always waiting to see the color drip. ",

105,1 March 2015,MrsHenry,1, A very bad film,"This is a terrible film: simply 3 hours of shouting. It's repetitive; lacking in narrative or plot; no drama; no character development; no wit; no light and shade; no insights - in short nothing at all to recommend it. It's true that DiCaprio gives a good performance, but the totality of the film is so bad it's not worth watching just to see him. The great puzzle is how director Martin Scorsese with his track record could come up with this rubbish? The fact that it gets good reviews just confirms to me that people get dazzled by star names and directors, and lose their sense of judgement. I can't see any other explanation for an 8.2 IMDb rating.",

The story is a mess as well, you really don't know why things are illegal, people really don't, on screen, suffer much from their addictions, there is little here that balances the celebratory with the downside so you never really get a sense of the actual consequences, in other words, the artistic message is muddled, characters come and go. Mostly we are shown a wonderful world of luxury with little real irony, no matter the feeble attempts to show the ""downside.""

Scenes including those topics were clearly uncomfortable and obscene but I tried to understand them as the way of highlighting immorality, vanity, and corruption of Belfort. Narrative style and various ways of editing make 'The Wolf of Wall Street' more interesting. Editing moves the story speedy, so the whole movie does not feel lengthened even if it lasts three hours. Entertainment value is high, but there is no message, lessons, or emotions left; or it sends out even wrong message because this film does not cast light upon victims of Stratton Oakmont swindle even for a second.",
113,21 October 2014,badfeelinganger,1, An irresponsible glorification rather than a satirical take-down.,"The film attracted conservative viewers by depicting a more moral tone in its marketing than the film itself depicted.Christina McDowell, daughter of Tom Prousalis (who worked closely with the real-life Belfort at Stratton Oakmont) wrote an open letter addressing Scorsese, DiCaprio, and Belfort himself, criticising the film for insufficiently portraying the victims of the financial crimes created by Stratton Oakmont, for disregarding the damage that was done to her family as a result of such, and for giving celebrity to persons (Belfort and his partners, including her father) who do not deserve it.The story ""wants us to be interested in characters who are dull people to start with, made duller by their delusions of being interesting because they are high.An irresponsible glorification rather than a satirical take-down.Ultimately hollow exercise in movie excess. Plays less as an insightful critique and more as an exercise in indulgence. There is no psychological insight, no moral insight, just no insight, full stop. And it palls after a while. It's sick and disturbing in all the wrong ways, rendering this 'Wolf' nothing but a dog.It's not OK to make three hours of graphic sex, epic drug binges, and general debauchery as boring as it is in The Wolf of Wall Street.As a major filmmaker, it's about time Scorsese found some material that stretched his ideas, rather than his audience's patience.As Johnny Rotten famously asked, ever get the feeling you've been cheated?I couldn't buy it, and couldn't wait for the hollow spectacle to end.The weakest movie in Martin Scorsese's fifty-year career, the worst writing Scorsese has ever been associated with.It's showy, but it doesn't amount to much.The characteristic traits build up, intolerably: the grinding pace, the deadening repetition, the pointless wordiness (Terence Winter's screenplay never shuts up), the self-congratulatory yuk-yuks.",

117,19 June 2014,haosstoposto,9, Nice view behind the scenes in the world of business,"This movie is known for its many swear words and nudity, but rest assured it is all with a purpose. It is based on an autobiography of Jordan Belfort (played by excellent Di Caprio), stock market manipulator. I will not elaborate much of the story because it is simple, a story of a self made man from his humble beginnings to his downfall, after some criminal activity, of course. The movie gives splendid presentation of how things work in today's economy and stock market exchange. It is a worrisome and at the same time funny business when you see that many people who rule the economy world are primitive, greedy, lying, manipulative, sinful people with short tempers. They apparently try to enjoy everything life has to offer, without limits. They enjoy drugs on regular basis, alcohol and all kinds of sex. In short, they are in all aspects priests of hedonism. Wherever you have success and money, the face under the make-up is ugly. But the most important scene in the movie, which recapitulates the whole thing, is with Di Caprio and Matthew McConaughey at the beginning where things are explained in short. Everything is a game without any meaning. The only goal is to make naive people give your their money and in exchange they receive the illusion that this money exists somewhere multiplied many times. As long they feel rich, they are rich. When they try to cash this money, the moment has arrived to deliver them from their illusion. Go see the movie, it will be informative and you will not regret it.",

This time around the excess on display is more or less everything except violence by which I mean sex, drugs, booze and leave us not forget excessive money-making, or, to put it another way, making more money that it's possible to spend so that the addiction is just to the physical act of making money not by digging ditches, punching a clock, selling haberdashery but by conning already gullible people into parting with money for shares in joke companies.

145,14 July 2018,benkitching13,9, Fringing upon a modern day masterpiece.,"Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street is a highly accomplished biographical dark comedy that encourages the viewer to revel in and be repulsed by the provocative life of it's protagonist: stockbroker Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio). The cinematography and editing is slick and fast paced and the film is at it's most intoxicatingly best when pulsing with energy; complimented by a perfect soundtrack. Similarly, DiCaprio, Robbie and Hill succeed in delivering phenomenal performances. DiCaprio's running monologue is witty and the humour occasionally hilarious. However, when the energy fades away and the film slightly loses it's established rhythm does the quality slightly decline.",

More interesting is what he does with his new found fortune: what follows is a heady tale of excess and debauchery based on Belfort's own memoirs.",

Martin is doing just fine. The Wolf Of Wall Street is well directed well acted well written and worthy of whatever praise and accolades it can gather.

It might be clever 'Scorscese' film making, but really it is a horrible excessive movie about utter pigs. Yes I get the 'haha they are drug animals without consciousness' but really. Hasn't Marty just also steamrolled right over the line of what can be put on a mainstream movie. I think this film is filth. Just depravity and a sad new low to what can appear on a multiplex cinema screen. Leonardo is so well liked and to see Marty excess the reasonable acceptability by having this young man and all other actors just degrade themselves so they can appear in a 'Martin Scorscese film' ... well it is a hollow victory. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is a degrading sad film made by an old man who likes to see good looking young people degrade themselves for his own gratification. He has insulted and degraded the entire film making system and those who participated in this ridiculous ugly mean film by being willing to undress and make ugly naked faces of themselves. It is horrible and a new low, the lowest since HOSTEL 2 in mainstream American movie making and nothing to admire or be proud of. I am sad for US film making and Scorscese needs to retire. It's grubby and Marty has grubbied young admirable talented Leonardo. Bad Bad and sad. ",

It seemed to be an over indulgent love-in of quality actors overplaying everything, the director trying to show off how fast he could get the cast to talk over each other with irrelevant excruciatingly long conversations of no interest to anybody except presumably the writer; and every character a ridiculous overplayed cartoon cutout. Even the steadfast investigating cop had to become a wisecracking Caprio mark 2 when the pair finally got together for their ""showdown"".

But, if this is a black comedy or A cautionary tale (which is it, Leo? It can't be both, so make up your mind) then it missed the mark. If we're supposed to learn something from this, then please show me how his life was ruined (less than two years in prison for scamming tens of thousands of people out of their life savings forcing countless people to lose their homes? Spending millions of dollars on hookers and drugs? And he still lands on his feet in the end. How is this cautionary?) Yes, yes, I know that some villains escape retribution and (even worse) don't seem to have learned anything from their downfall -- this is beautifully portrayed in the flawless GOODFELLAS. But this movie applauds rather than excoriates this steaming dog turd Belfort - most of the men in the audience I was with seemed to enthusiastically admire Belfort and thought he had it made. They didn't seem in the least appalled by the sociopathic manner in which he treated his customers (inexplicably, none of whom we ever see, nor do we see the aftermath of their ruined lives courtesy of The Demon Belfort - you see, that would detract from the good ole fun porn movie Leo and Marty so enjoyed making - let's keep those libidos high and the laughs coming!) Any woman unlucky enough to move into his sphere is treated like a whore, then condemned for being so. The most vile behavior of the characters is played for laughs (I guess these scenes are supposed to be the black comedy parts but neither Marty nor Leo seem to understand what constitutes black comedy). You failed, Leo and Marty. You failed miserably. Unless of course your aim was to make a corporate ""Porky's"" in which case you succeeded. And apparently, there is an inexhaustible supply of grotesquely pathetic women in Hollywood who will strip for the camera any time, anywhere, for any reason whatsoever thereby making it difficult for the rest of the female population to be viewed as anything other than bodies to be used and then thrown away - thanks a lot. The Academy has become increasingly more psychotic over the years, but seeing this cow patty nominated for a slew of Oscars is the final straw. I have no faith in Oscar anymore.

There's no question that the events depicted are fascinating and that Scorsese is a superb director. There are actually a few laugh-out-loud moments sprinkled throughout this film. Still, the movie is three hours long and, at times, feels that way. I kept expecting it to end half hour before it actually did. As has been noted everywhere, there is absolutely no one to root for or like during this entire running time. However, the performances are all quite good. You don't see many Oscar contenders like Leo get nominated for a film in which a candle appears in his ass. On that note, so much of this film focuses on the extremely vulgar and extremely decedent living. That certainly was the point but is it possible to drive home that point too much?

The audience laughed, because it was reviled to an extreme, so that the laugh was preferable to vomiting. Try as you will, you cannot roll in manure and come up clean. Most people recognize that depraved behavior in the end is destructive, to self and society. Why spend hours examining excrement? Is the critical merit ascribed by critics and users alike, that the movie is so repulsively done that it makes it art? By Hollywood standards, it seems so. The movie actually did what the characters did, it stole from viewers for its own excesses, to make money and achieve notoriety. They tried to portray filth without becoming filthy themselves.

That is just one side of the story, but that is what the audience is wholeheartedly focused on. It's not exactly only about a man who had done wrong choices then eventually learn by his mistakes in the end. It's more of a raucous portrait about rich people being petty, having way too much fun on their lust, never realized that they actually look terrible by it until they eventually become the worst of themselves.

It is a failed satire, if indeed it was meant to be a satire. It's overlong, overwrought, and ultimately boring.

This film entitled "" The Wolf of Wall Street "" was written by Jordon Belfort who's malicious deceptive practices eventually earn him a stint in Federal Prison. Taken from the excessive exploits of Jordon Belfort himself, it tells the story of a unemployed Wall Street executive who was abruptly lay-ed off but despite his fall, landed on his feet. Despite falling, he arose quickly to create a new financial institution which not only netted him millions, but created a whole new way to acquire further riches. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort, an enterprising salesman with a golden gift of gab. Inspired by Matthew McConaughey and his own convincing talent, Belfort take a converted Garage, added an exceptional sales crew, transform them into a sea of voracious financial sharks like Rob Reiner. Belfort then creates a lucrative financial institution which nets them untold millions. Achieving his ultimate success, he continues onward and upwards attracting the attention of Wall Street itself and of course agent Patrick Denham of The F.B.I. In addition, Belfort also seeks out and weds the love of his life Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie) who brings romantic security and domestic headaches as well.The movie is fast paced, money, drug and sex oriented along with the life style of the rich and famous. DiCaprio is in his element in this movie as are the talented actors of Scorseses' cast, who showcase what can happen when unbridled greed meets unrestricted wealth.

This is based on the memoirs of Jordan Belfort, a notorious stockbroker and self-made millionaire who's penny stock brokerage defrauded 1,500 clients of $200 million during the 1990's. He used aggressive sales tactics and adrenaline charged locker room motivational chants to persuade his vagabond group of 1,000 wannabes to follow his lead, get rich at any cost, especially to the client, and make a name for their brokerage, Stratton Oakmont. At three hours the movie is overly long given the numerous scenes of drug use, drinking, sex and raucous office parties, not to mention the nonstop foul language throughout. One clearly gets the message that Mr. Belfort is a debaucher, gluttonous, disloyal, lewd, immoral, fanatical, corrupt, demanding and ambitious, hence the title. Two hours would have been sufficient for this intense roller coaster ride of greed. I wonder if Mr. Scorsese is vicariously trying to relive the wild '60's in this film.",

The essential of the story is basically this: sex, drugs, sex with drugs, sex and drugs... did I forgot to mention sex and drug? Holy cow, what a waste of time and resources. Just a couple of scenes was enough to let the viewer knows the man was a drug addict and sex addict. I never expected an actor like Leonardo DiCaprio was able to work in this kind of movie. I did not recommend this movie. The movie is too long, is slow in the development, the script was a nice lullaby. Cinematography is fine, locations is fine, and the sound.

200,5 July 2020,gwnightscream,7, Good Bio Crime Drama,"Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie star in Martin Scorsese's 2013 crime drama based on a true story. DiCaprio (Titanic) plays Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker who forms a fraudulent firm and becomes a millionaire which raises suspicion with the FBI. Jordan also becomes addicted to sex, drugs & alcohol. Hill (21 Jump Street) plays Donnie Azoff, Jordan's pal & Vice President and the lovely, Robbie (Suicide Squad) plays Jordan's wife, Naomi. Kyle Chandler, Rob Reiner, Jon Bernthal, Jon Favreau & Matthew McConaughey also appear. This is a good flick, DiCaprio is great as usual and he & Robbie also were in ""Once Upon A Time in Hollywood"" together. Scorsese and DiCaprio work well together so if you're a fan of either, check this out with some caution.",

Scorcese is going for something here, so it's not lazy filmmaking. But I feel like I got the message about 45 minutes into the movie and it didn't go anywhere from there. In all fairness, I missed the last 20-30 minutes because I just couldn't take it anymore. Some ruthless cutting of the screenplay would have helped some, but I don't know if there's much to salvage. The experience of seeing this was rather like having a really stressful day at work where nothing actually gets accomplished. A lot of the ladies are beautiful, but the sex is ugly - demeaning to both women and men. Oh, but I guess it's really about Wall Street. And the motivational speeches to the troops go on forever. I don't think there was a scene in this film that employed any economy of storytelling whatsoever. One critic (approvingly) described this as the last half hour of Goodfellas stretched out to three hours and that's pretty true. It reminded me a bit of the single-mindedness of Raging Bull, but was much harder to sit through. I think it's a bad sign when you start hoping that some of the characters will die of an overdose just so they'll shut up.",

Smartass FBI guys comes after him, both sides attack and finally the material boy gets busted. He loses his money, friends, wife and children and restarts his life. Of course with the same blindness. Another failure for DiCaprio after Gatsby, which was full of showy scenes, ""wise (!)"" dialogues, expensive decors, image of young, handsome, brilliant character but still lacks some elements of a superb film. I don't need to criticize many ridiculous scenes (Like taking dozens of stacks of money abroad on them, DiCaprio's car driving after he gets paralyzed by drugs, Donnie's drowning, Donnie's and Brad's hassle in the street etc.) because maybe these scenes are supposed to be ""comic"". The main idea of the movie seems to be catching people's attention with the help of some explicit and exaggerated content. For those, who are to watch a movie about Wall Street for the first time and teenagers who like to see some hot women bodies, this movie is a good choice but for the rest it's a crap. One final note for Jean Dujardin, it's not a wise idea to act such a trivial character for an Oscar-winner actor, just because this is a Hollywood movie which is directed by Scorcese.",

Leo DiCaprio is effective as the drug-powered, decadent master of ceremonies, even showing us a glimmer of internal conflict behind the hazy fog of those unfocused eyes, but his rare moments of shame are quickly washed away with all manner of intoxicants. The film's purpose is puzzling. Are we to pull for this loathsome figure, the very embodiment of the ugly American 1-percent stereotype? Shall we root for his comeuppance at the hands of the law? Merely observe, jealous but just, as he squanders our relatives' retirement funds on a perpetual hunt for fleeting ecstasy? In any case, we're in for disappointment. After an hour, the novelty of this lewd dash of A-list voyeurism begins to wear thin. At two, it's long overstayed its welcome. Thirty minutes later, it begins to deal with repercussions, but those too are impermanent and flimsy. I'm torn. On the one hand, it's a savory experience, looking over the shoulder of giants as they splurge on a lustful life of luxury. On the other... did we really do more than spin our wheels?

I found the scene where Jonah Hill's character urinates on some subpoenas to be excessive. I especially found the scenes involving drugs and sex with hookers to be excessive. Worst of all the FBI agent played by Kyle Chandler was stuck living in a modest house and riding a subway while the greed head main characters lived in big, fancy houses and drove high end sports cars.

The same kind of voice-over, the same kind of characters, plot movements, etc. Scorcese was copying himself, which I thought was really really weak from such a renowned director. Like no original ideas in this one, just a lot of naked women added to it. I think the naked women shocked American audiences and made the movie be more remarkable here, but it's really not that good of a movie. The crooked shenanigans that the traders were doing on Wall Street stock exchanges to make tons of money so fast were phony and faked-very unrealistic and exaggerated.

219,14 November 2014,brchthethird,8," Somewhat of a thematic retread, but Scorsese fires on all cylinders","THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is insanely hyper-kinetic, wall-to-wall with sex and drug-taking, and the most energetic Scorsese has been since CASINO and GOODFELLAS. While this doesn't quite live up to those previous films, it is nevertheless quite entertaining. The story follows the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort, who ran a brokerage firm, Stratton Oakmont, in the late 80's/early 90's. Along the way, he makes a ton of money and indulges his every whim, which was mostly a lot of drugs. A smaller part of the story is how he was taken down by the FBI, but the main draw is obviously Jordan. In his previous gangster/crime films, Scorsese provided the viewer with a window into how those criminal enterprises operate, and he does the same here with white collar crime. One thing which was extremely effective, yet detracts from the experience a little bit, was how Scorsese used cinematic technique and a frenetic editing style to convey the themes of excess, over-indulgence and greed. It makes logical sense that a film about a person like Jordan Belfort would be this stuffed, even if it does start to wear on the viewer after a while (as it certainly did me). Fortunately, there were some quieter moments, and scenes where a voice of reason could be heard, even if it was ultimately ignored. However, there should be something said about the end result. Unlike previous characters who were reduced to shells of their former selves, Jordan Belfort gets off fairly lightly. Sure, he goes to prison, but it's a cushy prison and he only has to serve a few years. Perhaps this is cynicism on Scorsese's part, and maybe it's emblematic of where our society has gone. Instead of the ultimately good-natured criminal who looks out for the interests of a family-like organization, we have greedy vultures who only look out for themselves, and by and large we let them take advantage of us in ways that are truly despicable. The film makes a point about not showing the victims of Jordan's crimes, but I didn't find this too disheartening. The movie is meant to revolve around Jordan and to give the viewer an experience which approaches what his life was like. Sure, parts of it are extremely funny, but underneath all of the humor lies a rather masochistic current. Excess will ruin you, and by the end of this you should feel disgusted at how people are treated (especially the women) and exhausted from the whirlwind ride you've just been taken on. Even though the film does become repetitive after a while, I wouldn't have wanted to be taken on this journey with anyone but Scorsese. It's not quite a masterpiece, or even top-tier Scorsese, but it's a film worth watching even if only once.",
220,30 March 2014,cobar53,3, Avoid this piece of trash,"This film is peppered with unforgivable defects. Mr Scorsese has produced some very fine material, but this is not one of them. The word count would be about halved if the letters F U C and K were omitted. It was very offensive to me, and I have a pretty broad mind. The way women are portrayed is an insult to the modern world. And I am no feminist.

And time and time again, confronted with the truth that some actions eventually have their harsh consequences, they fail to react rationally and don't ever get out when things get hot until their actions take them to the critical point of no return where they can't keep escaping the inevitable and everything falls apart. The story seems to me just as an excuse to depict all that stupidity. I don't know if many people will bear it, I really didn't. It was a relief to see the movie end.",

The pace was fantastic but the tone of the movie was very much misguided. To a lot of people the whole depravity/greed point was missed because the tone of the movie was light and had almost no weight despite the gravity of what happens to the protagonist by the end. A lot of my friends (males) actually thought that going to prison for 3 years was nothing compared to the blissful obscene life of Jordan and were actually ready to give it a try if the opportunity presented itself.

However, it is too long, one hour and a half would have been more than enough. And the worst part of it: It has too much sex (looks like an adult movie in some scenes), too much drugs, too much vice, too much scamming, too much of human degradation. I'm sure this picture would have been much more impacting without so many demonstrations of human decadence. I know that all these situations attract viewers but I think that they were absolutely unnecessary in an otherwise excellent film. I can't imagine what would have happened if this movie was made in the 50s. The censorship would have banned it almost completely. I'm not against showing real life occurrences in a movie, but I think in this case the director exaggerated by including such degradation situations as orgies, how to use cocaine and how to deceive honorable investors. A message can be transmitted without disrespecting the human being. And perhaps the worst part of all this, why show fighting situations in front of a small child?",

They have to provide a certain amount of satisfaction to movie goers because they are directed by a renowned director or they cast actors who give their best in each and every role they play. The Wolf of Wall Street should have been one of these movies. This feature gets off to a strong start. For a while this initial putsch keeps you moving forward, expecting something to happen, something that would make you think, ""Yes! This is the movie I've been waiting for so long that I've forgotten what a good movie feels like"". Sadly, it does not get to be this movie. While getting to know the plot and the main characters something creeps into the mind of the observer. The nagging in the background becomes slightly louder with each new scene or dialog. In the end, the nagging becomes so loud that one can only shout, ""Shut up! , I want this to be a good movie, I want it to make me feel good."" Still, despite excellent performances by the actors and Martin Scorsese's best efforts, it fails to be this movie. Perhaps I'm spoiled, accustomed to certain probably unfairly high standards and expectations from the names of DiCaprio and Scorsese in the credits. Even if it were so, this movie is still full of much of which is unnecessary. So many narcotics floating around in the scenes that I ask myself, how is it even possible that these people could stand on their feet every morning. There are also a couple of scenes where there was no reason to show nudity. Don't get me wrong, I love nudity in movies. I do, honestly, but I also expect it to be a part of the story, a part that independently and harmoniously knits the plot together with all other elements of the story telling. In this feature, some of the nudity is simply embarrassing. Margot Robbie did not need to bare it all. All compliments to Ms. Robbie, but she should have thought harder before agreeing to the scene. Jonah Hill's pleasure trip during the party scene was also a bit over the top for me. What I liked best about this movie is Leonardo. I do not want to sound like a broken record, but the man is an excellent actor. He gave his best to this movie and it is simply not his fault I did not enjoy the movie as much as I wanted to. Fortunately enough there is one scene in the movie which alone makes it worth seeing. After taking more than a few Quaalude Lemmon 714 pills, DiCaprio's character looses the use of his speech and of his legs. This is when we get to see DiCaprio give one of his best performances I have seen since he portrayed Arnie Grape in What's Eating Gilbert Grape. In these few minutes he shows us what a great actor he is, and how little is required to make a masterpiece of a short sequence. This is not a bad movie by any standards. I did like it, but not to the extent I wanted to. I expected more. I would still tell you all to go and see it. Perhaps we can compare notes? Cheers.",

This is the most full-on production of the duo yet, and is very likely to remain so for some time at least, although it must be said that it is not really that overly shocking. There is quite a bit of nudity and sex, but only prudish fools get upset about that, and the swearing becomes unnoticeable after the first five minutes, likewise the tons and tons of drugs filling the screen. DiCaprio is fantastic and this is worthy of a watch just for his performance alone, the brilliant scene of him crawling on the ground to get to his Lamborghini after one too many funny pills shows a more physical side of his talent which is not always shown. The run length is as excessive as Belfort himself as a good 25-30 mins could have easily made it into deleted scenes, but I never once got bored, just a little bit tired of it all after about two and a half hours in. It's also well worth a look simply to get an account of the devils pulling all the strings to the financial world, and at times the feeling that the FBI cannot get the handcuffs out quickly enough and put these guys away is very strong.

This is a true story, of that you can be sure. A few viewers might find the rampant and reckless disregard of morality a bit off-putting, but I honestly think that this movie could have gone further... they didn't show any child prostitution and not any bestiality either, BOTH of which occur on a regular basis in the circles of the hyper-rich elite.

Instead of working at a prestigious Wall Street firm he ends up pushing penny stocks, basically junk, to people who can't really afford the losses they will surely face. It is profitable though and he quickly realises he can make a real fortune selling junk to rich people. He teams up with similarly minded people and creates a 'respectable' firm; soon he is dubbed 'The Wolf of Wall Street' and everybody wants to work for him.

It is easily the worst effort ever from Martin Scorsese. The story line is almost non existent , DiCaprio is just a loser with a loud mouth, and all the surrounding characters are one dimensional. I don't see any moral battle being fought, I don't care about seeing hookers, lots of drugs being taken , or stupid parties, very boring. The real role model in the story cites his hero's as Gordon Gekko of Wall Street, Don Johnson of Miami Vice, and Richard Gere in Pretty Woman, what a completely shallow loser, even in todays bottom feeding America. The whole effort is simple B movie territory, not just because of the 80's and 90's settings. Couple this film with American Hustle, and you have a pretty awful state of 2014 film-making.",

Usually I'd not particularly go for a film like that but it is a biopic and based on the book by Jordan Belfort (played by DiCaprio). It's a man gets super-rich by nefarious means and goes a bit crazy kind of film; women, drugs, big boy-toys and all the trappings of the nouveaux riche, and then his downfall. It's a sort of morality tale, his lifestyle is meant to be seen as depraved and excessive (in a bad way) not admirable and the Director (Scorsese) and the writers make that clear as Belfort (and the other men too) unravels.",
278,18 February 2014,jbacks3,4, Marty... please stop with the voice over narrations already...,"Wow, WoWS is getting critically mauled on these user reviews! But indulge my 2-cents: What works: The level of acting is terrific. I'm not a Jonah Hill fan and I'll give his chops (rumor has it he was paid a paltry $60K in what's purported to be a $100 million production--- if true, he was robbed). His Donnie Azoff (aka in real life as Danny Porus) is a difficult character, having no redeeming qualities to draw from. DiCaprio also manages to pull off a convincing Jordan Belfort and as he possesses a face that has refuses to age, we see Belfort as a hungry 23-year old through about 1998. DiCaprio has a firm grip on the guy, and there's one outlandish scene involving a fistful of Quaaludes that kick in at an inopportune moment. Watching Leo chemically melt on a pay phone and throw his body like a mangled Slinky is the one best scene in the film. What doesn't work: The script is pointless. There's no moral center, not a single redeeming character to empathize with. The inevitable outcome happens with no great surprises, no clever plot twists, nothing. These people are all scumbags. A lot has been said about the nudity. I'm no prude and find it sadly amusing that we Americans don't bat an eye at catastrophic body counts in mindless action movies but howl at skin. But okay, WoWS has an unusually high amount of nudity, sex, raunch and Marty seems perfectly willing to give us what he wants. And I will agree that it should probably have been more correctly released as an NC-17 (the fact that this received a R at all makes me question the rating board itself). Another criticism: I've grown tired of the Scorsese narration. It worked in Goodfellas and Casino but without a tighter script, listing to a voice over pieced out over 3 hours weighs the film down. Although I enjoyed it more than most people here, it would've been greatly improved by whittling 25 minutes off a better script.",

In recent memory, only The Avengers comes to mind. But what makes The Wolf of Wall Street such a success is that it shows Martin Scorsese doing what he does best. He takes the tale of Jordan Belfort, an intelligent yet mischievous stockbroker who was very skilled at swindling stocks, manipulating the stockmmarket, and turns it into the cinematic equivalent of an injection of coke, meth, heroin, codeine, aderall and a number of uppers and downers- all at once. In other words, it's a crazy, wild ride. And if this were any other filmmaker, it wouldn't have turned out as well as it did, nor would I have been able to sit through it for two hours, let alone the three hours that The Wolf of Wall Street runs.

The glamorous, inhuman life of Jordan belfort was demonstrated with the purpose of idealising the motivation and ambition Belfort undergoes, inspiring the audience. Dicaprio perfectly captivates the character of Jordan, depicting his growth as a person (gaining success and power) and battling the consequences throughout the late 80s, early 90s. Scorsese includes the thought of trends throughout that time, he creates a stylish, aesthetically pleasing movie. With the addition of Margot Robbie, the film takes a raunchy turn. Hill, Dicaprio's co-star, creates an amusing, comedic side to the story of the wayward tale. Similarly to Dicaprio his character experiences a rapid rise in wealth and success, the story shows how they both deal with this sudden change in life. Scorsese portrays this experience in a colourful, luxurious and fashionable manor. This is definitely one of Scorsese's best productions, the shots have been taken with an insightful intent, producing a unique perspective, cleverly designed to showcase the extreme wealth that is amongst this film. There is not one boring moment in this movie. You will be hooked. An all round 10/10 production.",

If he rushes through a compressed editing schedule to meet an Oscar-friendly release date – as he did on The Wolf of Wall Street – his work suffers. Scorsese's latest clocks in at 180 minutes, not because its characters or narrative demand that kind of exhaustive treatment, but because Scorsese didn't have time to find a more focused, impactful shape for the film.

The main character is just a brat with addictions: drug, sex and money. Like a teenager-for-ever -type. He never grows and he never learns. At the end he is still making money for himself and some avid listeners. I hope his methods are legitimate now. But there is virtually no reference to the outside world. No political or philosophical connotations. And during this time inside Wall street was happening a lot! Later we found out what... So my only complaint is that this movie tries to be a Novel (apparently Epic Novel for 3 hours!)but manages in only being a short story.",

313,7 May 2019,PCT1970,9, Greedy Wolf,"Arguably one of Scorsese's best to date. The film examines individuals consumed by the want of money and the richness it brings. In this case the richness that is depleted from humanity. DiCaprio portays the most narcissistic character this viewer has ever witnessed on the silver screen. It's astonishing that it's based on true events. The film tells the story of Jordan Belfort who starts his own brokerage firm and bilks his investors out of millions of dollars with an idea that started with penny stocks. He starts the firm with his cronies that follow him from his beginning and their loyalty is unflappable. This proves to be crucial when Belfort's rags to riches meteoric rise catches the eye of a dogged SEC agent. He is on to Belfort and is hell bent on taking him down. While Belfort's lifestyle of debauchery and belief of being untouchable continues the agent is closing in. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this film it is virtually impossible to pick a favorite. Excellent direction, screenplay, soundtrack, cinematography, costume, editing and acting. All of the artists involved deliver superlative performances. DiCaprio, Hill, Chandler and Robbie stand out. However it is DiCaprio who is commanding and mesmerizing. The plot is outrageous, uproarious, insightful, explorative, ingenious, sublime, intelligent, duplicitous, captivating, poetic and has a cathartic ending. To this day you'll hear fans of this film quote such famous lines as Belfort's, ""Sell me this pen"". This a a timeless masterpiece and remains one of the very best in it's genre.",

318,22 July 2019,Dello_,8, The sickness of excesses,"""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a great movie, with some excellent acting performances (DiCaprio in particular gives one of the best acting piece of his career), a perfect direction from Scorsese and very well made in general. The story is about Jordan Belfort, a broker which becomes rich and starts to live by excesses. This film is indeed a critic to this lifestyle, which is shown attractive and satisfactory at first, but it destroys who live this way and their families and friends with the passing of time. The movie makes a great job conveying a nauseating feeling through the noumerous scenes about drugs, alcohol and sex which are excessive and make fun of this people.
The only criticism I have is that I found is it a bit too long. This length is justified by the willingness to tell the story of Jordan Belfort without rushing anything but I felt like something could be cut, like 15-20 minutes, but it's not a big deal because the film is well made. And also a little thing about the editing: there is a scene near the 20 minutes mark in which it is so bad beacuse two characters are talking to each other and everytime the camera changes to frame the other its position is different and it is confusing. Fortunately it lasts like one minute.
""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a great movie but it requires some time, so you have to watch it with no urgency to fully enjoy it.",

320,4 December 2020,edgeofreality,9, Manic,"Dubious entertainment, but so fast paced and manic I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Is this the same director who made The Silence, Kundun and Last Temptation? It's the flip side of his spiritual films, and in some ways seems equally if not more honest - not to real life, but to whatever makes Scorsese such an irresistible filmmaker.. The film feels like a teenage kid flashing a porno picture at you and laughing satanically because he knows you are tempted. Di Caprio gets his best role in a Scorsese film, more or less playing himself on overdrive. However, one can question the cynicism at the centre of the film merely by observing that most people would have died from that amount of drugs: Di Caprio comes out looking mildly haggard. Not do we see the repercussions of his betrayal of friends. Nor does the 'system' he uses to get super rich make any sense. Then again, stars barely seem to age and most build their fortunes on a minimum amount of talent fine tuned to last indefinitely, so maybe their greed for success, talent for swindling and being selfish does work in keeping one young, and Belfort's story is also at the heart of Hollywood and what attracted Scorsese et all. Who cares, enjoy the film.",
321,3 January 2014,deangelised,1," Boring for adults, fun for teenagers","About 75% of the movie consist of sexual content and consumption of forbidden substances.

The main character is an ordinary control freak, who is constantly anxious and tortured by the fear of losing control and tries to remedy that by sex, drugs and booze. Teenagers will be happy to watch something ""Hangoverish"" here, but for a responsible adult the main character would look despicable and offensive. If you are a teenager, you should see this movie for sure: you will catch a lols and fun. If you are a grownup man with a sense of responsibility, this may be plainly boring for you.

The film itself is fatally flawed; the characters are very one dimensional and the leading character, brilliantly played by Leonardo Di Caprio, is a sleazy and obnoxious parasite for whom it is very difficult to develop any sympathy whatsoever. Scorsese is used to handling such individuals from his gangster epics but depicting Belfort as some kind of financial gangster somehow fails to convince me. Sure, there are some very funny scenes, but most of the story gets lost in over the top shouting, swearing and general hysteria. You can't help thinking that the main characters all belong in a lunatic asylum even before the film really gets going. No doubt the many Scorsese fans will praise him to the hilt, but this effort is a disappointment when compared to his many previous successes.",

An hour of relentless f-wording and brutal sexist behavior toward women was enough for me. I walked out. Mr. Scorsese you are starting (if not already) losing some of your best admirers by this. To me it reflects a screenwriter who thinks he needs to use explicit language to make a film about a bad guy interesting to audiences. Might I suggest you get your screenwriters together in one room and watch the entire series of ""Breaking Bad"" to see how to write a great script. No profanity. No sexist drivel.

This film is based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, a Wall Street stockbroking huckster, who used legitimate and illegal tactics to sell bad shares to mugs in the boom years of the nineties. Not only that he spent money to excess, and squirrelled it away illegally in Switzerland. His personal life would make that of a debauched Roman Emperor look like a Puritan - cue hookers, strippers, full front nudity, and drugs galore! So, excess is shown.... over and over again. In fact, this three hour pic should either have been a mini series or just two hours of hard hitting condemnation. But Scorsese indulges himself hoping to ping the great US public to reform themselves and their greed - some hope! But he is brave enough to try and attack the self-righteous hypocrisy that stands at the heights of the US financial and industrial power. But basically the main fault of the film is that it is a rerun of his other movies, eg 'Goodfellas.' The character of the FBI agent represents the ordinary Joe who lives on a normal salary and catches the subway home, while Belfort indulges in the American Dream unfettered by ethics or the law.

352,24 May 2014,alex-kirkby,8, At last a Leonardo DiCaprio film that makes me laugh in so many ways,"DiCaprio is an actor that I have been very hear and there with. He is a fantastic actor but he has made some very bad films in the past and I will have to say The Departed was the last good film I have seen of his and that was made 8 years ago. If you don't agree with my choice in films I don't really care I just haven't liked his films that much. This film delivers a fantastic story full of laughs, sex, drugs and a whole lot of money. This film does have its ups and downs. The first is that the film is to long and it could of been shortened down by at least 30 minutes even an hour. And the second is that there is just too much swearing in the film come on there are times when I fort they could of said something better then F this and F that. The good thing about the film is that it does deliver on almost every scale. First is the story the film tells a very interesting story which fells almost lubricous when you think about. However this film can not be interrupted firstly you got to completely sit still and watch it because if you are playing on your iPad or doing some work on the computer then you will lose track of what's going on and you may become bored with it in some way trust me I did. Second is Jonah Hill, I hate this actor and he is the reason to why I hated 21 Jump Street but I have to say I did like him in this as he was the only actor that could play himself, OK maybe that's the way the character acted in real life but Jonah Hill plays him like he plays every other character he plays childish, stupid and completely perfect plus he never shuts up and I thanked god when Jon Bernthal knocked him out. Next is the sex, this film is full of it and I am really surprised it wasn't classed as pore movie in some places. I will have to say sex is what made it a bit over the top OK it was great seeing all the hot naked women but I have to say there is a line and this film stepped over it quite a through times and this is where it links in to the story line for example with the plane full of hookers and everyone is getting laid. Nice idea but come on its a bit hard to believe that someone can hire a huge plane and full it up with hooks and turn it in to a whore house. The next bit is the drugs, I am not a big fan of films based on drugs, however with out them in a film like this it may become a little doll and as this is based on a true story they can't leave something like this out and we all know or we can all guess that most of the people in Wall Street take drugs because for some of them a good nights rest and a hot shower in the morning won't help them in this line of work. The last is the cast, Leonardo DiCaprio is a good actor he's not the best but he's not the worst ever, Johan Hill is OK in this in my opinion I would of chose someone a lot better for role like Jim Carrey or Steve Carell as they are fantastic actors and they can play many different characters and would of delivered a much better performance then Johan Hill. Lastly is Jon Bernthal, this actor has come quite far since his time in the walking dead and he has worked with many Hugh actors like Andrew Lincoln, Sylvester Stallone, Robert DeNiro, Dwayne Johnson, LL Cool J and of course Leonardo DiCaprio. This film has it's ups and downs and it is differently worth a try and if you like everything I talked about above then this will be a film for you.",

A brilliant director, fantastic acting and an unlimited budget should make for a triumph but I felt that I was trapped for three hours in a Big Brother house with a bunch of morons. There wasn't one character to sympathise with, nobody to like and the concept of stealing money from people, though occasionally funny, was like watching a bunch of vandals smash a bus shelter. I was persuaded to see the film by my lovely girlfriend and I was determined to try my best to overcome my misgivings, but it pans out exactly as you'd expect; from the first attempts at thieving to the inevitable climax.

The time flew by. The performances were riveting and dazzling. Leonardo DiCaprio proves over and over again to me just how superb an actor he is. I believe he has not gotten the recognition he deserves. Glad he received the Golden Globe and hope he receives the Academy Award. He is probably among difficult competition but he surely will be in contention. The foreign press gave him the Globe for best actor in a comedy. I was surprised about the comedy part but after seeing the film, my sides hurt from laughing so much. Does it glorify Wall Street? NOT from my perspective. I think it makes fun of Wall Street by its never- ending Roman orgy like spectacle. If one is offended by bad language, tons of sex, tons of nudity and drugs galore than this is, perhaps, not the film for you.

I too was not surprised by anything that I saw on the screen however, I just wanted to see the parts that I probably missed the first time; although the film is about three hours long, it moves so quickly that it would easy, at least for me, to miss not only the dialogue but some of the visuals.",

Today, 20 years later, the financial fraud on Wall Street has not only not converged, but has intensified, its means are more changeable, the decoration is more gorgeous, the concealment is more profound, and the impact is even greater. Belfort's scam was nothing compared to today's scam. Under the guidance of money and desire, more outlaws set up all kinds of tricks to defraud investors of their wealth. ""We haven't learned our lesson, and things haven't changed,"" Terence Winter, the screenwriter of Wolf of Wall Street, said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. This means that the fraud on Wall Street will continue normally with (Business as usual). The film does not provide an answer to how to put an end to Wall Street moths because there are no ready-made and easy answers in real life. However, from the perspective of literary and artistic works, the film reveals these ugly traditions, links and insiders on Wall Street. It sounded a wake-up call for people. As far as this is concerned, I think this is a film worth watching.",

It seems like one action takes hours - the expected climax never comes. The pointed out actions are also meaningless for the development of the story - they are just pointed out because... ? maybe because they are obscene.

The acting was OK but hard to enjoy in the context of the real story and the thought that I was contributing to their wealth and probably boosting their pathological egos, not something I want to spend my money on.

When he was working on Wall Street his company was engaged in a lot of corruption. What I loved about this film was the acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, he really played the part well. Also I liked how the film had comedy through it even though it deals with some intense themes. I wasn't such a fan of Jonah Hill, I find he tries to hard to be funny. I think the film really shows the extremes of what people will do for money and of course the consequences of having too much of it.

Divisive but acclaimed overall, TWOWS, with its depictions of swearing, greed, sex, drug use, moral corruption and bad behaviour does not know the art of taste or the art of subtlety, but if you can look past its lack of taste, it's a relentless, ruthlessly effective and devilishly demented black comedy which is less a movie, more a machine gun helicopter blasting its way through every tasteful movie studio around.

But, with that being said, Scorsese is THAT good that saying this isn't his best film just means it is the best of the year and not of the decade. This film is insightful, poignant, and downright hysterical from start to finish. It leans more towards Scorsese's comedy genre, much in the vein of After Hours with a little smidgen of Goodfellas and Casino added to intensify the film high you get when you watch this. The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring film with energy to spare and performance to marvel at. Martin Scorsese directs yet another unforgettable performance from DiCaprio and gives Jonah Hill a high point in his career. Between all the Quaalude, cocaine, and hookers, there is a Greek tragedy playing out before our eyes. Belfort goes from being the top broker/criminal at his firm to being a drug fueled, yuppie with high minded ambitions that always seem to have a funny and hysterical way of falling through. The film is a chronicle of his rise and fall and clocking in at 3 hours, you barely feel it. The film is so energetic in telling this story that it is hard to look the other way even when we are exposed to characters smoking crack, popping Quaalude like Skittles and snorting more cocaine than Tony Montana along with banging every hooker north of Manhattan.

414,4 February 2014,jboothmillard,9, The Wolf of Wall Street,"From Oscar and BAFTA nominated director Martin Scorsese (Taxi Driver, GoodFellas, The Departed), I saw the trailer for this film, although it looked interesting I wondered if I would really watch it, but of course I was going to when awards season came around, this got nominated a good number. Based on the autobiography of the real man, Jordan Belfort (Golden Globe winning, Oscar and BAFTA nominated Leonardo DiCaprio, also producing) started working on Wall Street as a stockbroker, he was barely into the job and the firm fails following Black Monday, but his boss Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) advised him when he makes the money to take advantage of it, adopting a lifestyle full of casual sex, cocaine and other drugs when successful. The stockbrokers job market is in a poor state and Jordan is unemployed, so he takes a job in a Long Island boiler room dealing in penny stocks, encouraged by his wife Teresa Petrillo (Cristin Milioti), he earns himself a small fortune with his aggressive pitching style and a high commission rate, and he meets and befriends small businessman Donnie Azoff (Oscar nominated Jonah Hill) who is keen to work for him and make money. Jordan and Donnie go into business together, recruiting a number of friends, many dealing marijuana to help facilitation, they create Stratton Oakmont, Inc. the name may be respectable but all runs on a pump and dump scam with customers on the telephone, and eventually Forbes magazine interviews Jordan, dubbing him the ""Wolf of Wall Street"", but this pres works to the company's advantage as hundreds of ambitious young financiers want to work for them. What follows is a lavish lifestyle filled with parties, sex and drugs, with Jordan hooked on sex with prostitutes, and an addiction to cocaine and hypnotic drugs, but Stratton Oakmont is under the watch of the FBI, and Agent Patrick Denham (Super 8's Kyle Chandler) is investigating, with the Securities and Exchange Commission involved as well, and meanwhile after a meeting at one of his parties, and an affair, Jordan gets a divorce and marries Naomi Lapaglia (About Time's Margot Robbie), and months later they have daughter Skylar. Securing the IPO (Initial public offering) of Steve Madden Ltd. Jordan makes an instant $22 million, he sees corrupt banker Jean Jacques Saurel (The Artist's Jean Dujardin) and opens a Swiss bank account to hide the money, under the name of Naomi's British Aunt Emma (Joanna Lumley), and he eventually smuggles the cash into Switzerland, but the schemes are almost exposed following Donnie having a public fight courier Brad Bodnick (Jon Bernthal) who is arrested. A string of bad news is happening, Donnie gives Jordan a powerful brand of Quaaludes to ease the stress, but they take large doses as their potency seems to have worn off with age, and at the point he is receiving calls from his private investigator Bo Dietl, he wants to avoid being tapped and being arrested, and at the wrong moment the drugs finally kick in, debilitated and driving he is too late to stop Donnie using the phone to Saurel, they have a bad fight, Donnie almost chokes on food, but Jordan uses coke to counteract the drug effect and save his life. Jordan's father Max Belfort (Rob Reiner) knows the shadow of law enforcement is hanging over Stratton Oakmont, he convinces his son to step down and escape legal charges, but when he does arrange a leaving party he changes his mind and refuses to back down, encouraging all his staff to keep doing what they are doing, of course the heart attack death of Emma mean trouble, so to avoid passport stamping Jordan and Donnie sail to Monaco and Switzerland, only to have the yacht capsize in a violent storm, and in the chaos Jordan sees their rescue plane explode because of a seagull flying into the engine, he sees this as God telling him to sober up. Two years pass, and during the filming of an infomercial Jordan is arrested by Denham, Saurel told the FBI everything, and is arrested in Florida for an unrelated charge, and meanwhile following one last night of sex with his wife, Naomi wants a divorce, and Jordan violently angry gets high on hidden cocaine and attempts to take his daughter away to stop her getting custody, but he only ends up crashing. With evidence against him overwhelming, to lessen his sentence Jordan agrees to help the FBI, so he goes to work wearing a wire, but they catch him out finding a silent note he showed Donnie telling him not to incriminate himself, Stratton Oakmont is raided and shut down, and Jordan is sent to a minimum security prison for 36 months, in the end, following his release Jordan made an innocent living teaching sales technique in seminars. Also starring Jon Favreau as Manny Riskin, P.J. Byrne as Nicky 'Rugrat' Koskoff, Spike Jonze as Dwayne, Christine Ebersole as Leah Belfort, Brian Sacca as Robbie 'Pinhead' Feinberg, Henry Zebrowski as Alden 'Sea Otter' Kupferberg and Ethan Suplee as Toby Welch. DiCaprio gives a brilliant charismatic and vibrant performance (you can see the real Jordan Belfont at the end), Hill is fantastic support as the larger than life buddy, this film is not afraid to show a high amount of excessive drug use and hardcore sex sequences, sometimes both combined, it does so in a funny way too, it is a great mix of laughable bad behaviour, dramatic and thought-provoking material, and of course illegal activities that really happened, it really is an exhilarating and interesting must see crime drama based on a true story. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Editing for Thelma Schoonmaker, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. Leonardo DiCaprio was number 94 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",
415,21 April 2014,Turfseer,5, Occasionally interesting chronicle of Wall Street scam artist's life ends up as a poor man's 'Good Fellas',"I like to think of 'The Wolf of Wall Street' as a poor man's 'Good Fellas'. They're both based on a true story about a character who is a moral failure and they both rely quite a bit on a narrator as well as improvised dialogue. 'Good Fellas' was primarily successful due to the strong, believable performances of Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci; both those actors were of Italian descent and they were playing characters that also were supposed to be Italian. But here Leonardo DiCaprio is supposed to play Jordan Belfort, a Jewish guy from Queens. I watched clips of the real Belfort and I just felt DiCaprio doesn't come close to capturing the essence of the 'Wolf of Wall Street' (maybe I associate DiCaprio with too many other characters in films that he's been in before or maybe he simply is unable to move beyond his own persona). One other problem is that the stakes in 'Good Fellas' were much higher: there was that enormous Lufthansa heist and people being whacked all over the place; but here it's just a matter of investors being conned (who you never get to see on screen) and an anti-hero who's prone to a life of extraordinary excess.",

That an iconic director like Scorsese would fashion such a juvenile, indulgent and ultimately boring piece of trash like this is unimaginable. It's as if Shakespeare were to pen a couple of episodes of Gilligan's Island or Mozart to compose a jingle for Justin Bieber. That it was nominated in the Academy's Best Picture category to the exclusion of movies like The Butler or Inside Llewyn Davis is reprehensible. It's also pathetic that Mr. Scorsese seems to be following in the dirty old man-director footsteps of Stanley Kubrick (Eyes Wide Shut) by offering as much nudity and sex as possible for no apparent reason other than crass titillation. But that's not the biggest problem here. I don't have any problem with pictures that deal with sex or aberrant relationships or violence or excess as long as they're created with some artistry. I DO have a problem with pictures that are simply tedious. Shame on you, Mr. Scorsese.",

Every scene, every shot, every performance is about as good as it gets. Standing out of course are DiCaprio and Hill. Hill transforms himself in this film but DiCaprio gives the best performance of his career. He jumped head first into the role and there isn't one moment that you are watching this where you feel like you are watching Leonardo DiCaprio. What you are seeing on screen is Jordan Belfort. He is brave, brilliant and fearless. Snort coke off a hookers breasts? No problem. Blow coke into a hookers ass? He does that. Give rousing speeches that compel me, the viewer, want to work for him? It's in here. Dance, get naked, party, crawl around like a baby, cry, show vulnerability, it's all in here. It is one of, if not the best performance in a film I have ever seen. DiCaprio is good in everything I have seen him in, but he has taken the extra step here. He knows Jordan Belfort. There is a scene where he crawls around on the floor for 10 minutes in a drug induced paralysis and it will go down as not only the scene of the year (along with the ejaculation discussion in This is the End) but one of the most messed up but brilliant scenes in film history.

I cringed at the many awkward acting scenes between the main characters. The juvenile toilet humour used in the movie to illustrate the debasement of Jordan Belfort was boring and even nauseating at times. I found it odd that Scorcese chose to leave out Jordan Belforts Jewish background, as well as many of the main characters in the actual biography of Jordan Belfort. This undercuts much of the meaning and social commentary, not to mention irony ie. when the up and coming lords of the universe decide to call their company Stratton Oakmont' such a WASPY sounding name tee hee. such chutzpah. The scenes where Jordan Belfort talks to the camera is reminiscent of the scene from Goodfellas when 'Henry Hill played by Ray Liotta"" gets up out of the witness stand in court and starts talking to the camera. Many scenes during ""wolf of wall street"" made me feel ashamed for Scorcese because he shamelessly plagiarizes ''Goodfellas"". The trajectory of the movie is obvious and not surprising. I found this movie to be far beneath expectation. Di Caprio was alright in his efforts. Nothing special. But Matthew Mconaughey was absurd, Cringe worthy! (I was very uncomfortable watching Mconaugheys outlandish display of pounding his chest and humming a mantra. He just was not believable, his cadence was off.

It just continued to get better as you watched. I was glued to the screen all the way through and was mesmerized by Leonardo Di Caprio and his deserved Oscar winning role. I applaud his talent of multi genre acting, and how he managed to fit that all in one movie. He did so well I started to believe he was actually a filthy rich stock broker. Also Margot Robbie did an astounding job as Jordan Belfort's wife Naomi. Martin Scorsese deserves another Oscar. Him and Leo make the best team in many movies. Plus one that is based on a true story (and at the same time a book) is always promising. There was no way this movie could have gone bad, every way you look at it, its got the best actors, narration, camera work, and script and screenplay.

Jonah Hill is incredible and really became Danny and was so funny with no just his dialogue but his mannerisms. To me this is one of Leo's best performances and this is a film he should have won an Oscar for. The drug fueled phone call and drive Home Screen alone should have brought him the prize. The physical comedy Leo gives us in that scene is a shinning light in his career and shows how great he is at playing the Villain who has insane charisma. All of these people are horrible and they deserved to be in prison for much longer because they just stole from everyone and ruined peoples lives for their own gain and essentially got a slap on the wrist for it. That's why a lot of people hate the film because todays world is full of criticism of these major issues but no action.

Jordan Belfort is a character that can't stop plumbing the depths of depravity, drowning in wads upon wads of banknotes and seizing every opportunity he eyes, and the magnificent Leonardo DiCaprio delivers perfectly as always.

439,19 November 2014,BlueFairyBlog,9, The Wolf Eats Well,"The greatest thing about this addictive, chaotic, machismo piece of beefcake movie magic, would have to be Scorsese's ability to slow down where it hurts, and show big moments in really long scenes. The life of Jordan Belfort is portrayed as a mélange of orgies, parties, business dealings, extortion, pure crime, and unabashed and unapologetic decadence. Even from the start of the film Belfort is unapologetic, which may be the true theme of the entire film. Though he feels neglectful of his family, irresponsible in his business dealings, and drug addled to the point of insanity, in the end he really feels unapologetic. Having a character like this is refreshing, since we haven't seen this level of criminality since Gordon Gekko. Not only is Belfort uncaring, but he traverses in a world of richness and depravity that we couldn't even handle. Scorsese takes his time, and creates big, beautiful set pieces, that take a lot of time and explain very little in terms of plot. These scenes are amazingly intricate and are some of the most memorable moments of the film. The entire sequence when Belfort (DiCaprio) is on lemons and has to make it home from the country club, could have been trimmed, but because Scorsese let it go on and on we got to appreciate the level of helplessness Belfort was going through. We saw his immaturity, his guilt, and his horror at the state of his life, and that can't be replicated in any one line of dialogue. The scene where they're speaking about the contract with the dwarfs and how they should have been treated, could have been cut easily, but it shows how Belfort and his associates treated those they could buy, and led to one of the funniest moments in the film. This film is downright hilarious at many points, especially when dealing in character development. Jonah Hill deserved that Best Supporting Oscar nomination, because he not only handles diverse moments of dramatic tension, but he's laugh out loud hilarious. Donnie Azoff could not have been played by a funnier person, or a better actor, and every time he's on screen it's another chance for us to see just how removed from reality these people really are. There's also a level of opulent violence that shifts underneath the surface that we don't always see, but we know it's there. While movies like ""Scarface"" put the prospect of violence in the forefront of your mind, ""Wolf"" builds its tension over time, until characters erupt. While Belfort may not be violent towards his wife throughout most of the film, he is emotionally abusive and their fights are temperamental. It makes that much more sense when things become physical. There were some excellent performances from many of the cast, especially DiCaprio in the lead role. While many of DiCaprio's roles kind of blend together for me, this was a truly unique, unequivocal performance. Belfort's brazen love for business, and building himself up to the highest level possible, is his undoing time and time again. He can't walk away, even when he's offered an out, only because of his pride. Even today Belfort makes his money easily, with a level of persuasion that can only be portrayed by DiCaprio. Hill is enigmatic and perfectly crazed as Azoff, Margot Robbie is a delight in her role as Belfort's second wife Naomi, Matthew McConaughey is just the right level of kooky misanthrope as Belfort's mentor in the beginning, Rob Reiner is perfect as Mad Max Belfort, a man who is always angry and always influenced by his son's schemes, and Kyle Chandler is a surprisingly entertaining choice for the FBI agent who takes Belfort down, commanding his time on screen with a very complex and layered performance. This isn't exactly a love letter to the world of Wall Street, or even to the lives of the rich and famous. We as the audience don't want to see Belfort succeed or fail, we just want to see what he does next. Belfort's life is so chaotic and crazed that he seems unreal in such a huge sense. Between the legions of hookers, the drugs, the money, and the antics of his entire office, the film plays more like the exploits Caligula than the playboy world of a charlatan like Belfort. For many, they found no insight into the moral capacity of the character. Without morality critics decided that this was a hollow perspective intent on showing indulgence. I disagree heartily, and would argue that this is much more a character study than anything. There's solid humor to this film, there's a decent level of character development, and for what it's worth, there doesn't need to be a moral. Scorsese shows us that these men exist, and they are getting away with everything, to the point where they can brag about it. Scorsese doesn't want us aligning ourselves with the likes of Belfort, and he certainly isn't legitimizing the exploits of his company. He set out to make a ""ferocious"" film, and he did just that, creating a black comedy that shows what modern day indulgences look like, and how they are being employed by everyone and anyone who can get their hands on their version of the American Dream.",

The relationship between Jordan and his 2nd wife reminds me a lot of the Robert De Niro/Sharon Stone relationship from Casino. It was done better in Casino in my opinion but it's done great in this film as well. Having said all that, I think this movie is slightly overrated. If I had to rank all the Scorsese films I've seen (which is about 70% of them) it would probably land around the middle. DiCaprio gives a great performance but like Scorsese, I don't think it's his best.

A lot of the naysayers say that the movie glorified the excesses of drugs, women, money and just about everything that can be abused.

Directed by a master filmmaker, Martin Scorsese doesn't help that the movie is great or something. The movie is filled with sex, drugs, money, games, drink, girls etc. but really nothing more! I know that this is the story of a guy whose life consists of such kind of activities, but the problem is that The Wolf of Wall Street is just a hilarious biopic, an entertaining popcorn flick, a dark comedy, an amusing adventure, but no more than that. This is a rise and fall story and during the whole movie, you don't feel bored. Comparing to Scorsese's old classics, this is just an ordinary movie. It doesn't feel like a Scorsese flick. The Big Short, American Hustle, American Made, this movie is in the same category. Some jokes, some scenes are amusing, but there is no emotion, thrill or an amazing piece of cinema feeling in this movie. Oliver Stone's Wall Street is a much, much better film, but I understand that this movie is for our generation and Scorsese adapts himself into this generic, formulaic storytelling instead of putting his one of a kind signature. Everyone with me at the theatre left satisfied and pleased except for me I guess. Jonah Hill does his part as a comedian, Di Caprio gives a hilarious performance, but not among the best (may I remind you The Revenant, The Departed, Django Unchained etc?), Matthew McConaughey steals all the scenes he is in, Margot Robbie plays a sexy housewife and in the end, this movie is considered to be a masterpiece!",

Leonardo DiCaprio pulled off that ""rich young wide-eyed guy"" role quite well, in my opinion. I did think they overdid it with the drug use, although there were points where it became quite humorous. The ""antagonist"" if you could call him that, did come off in the way he should have: a devotee trying to do his job, even if he did take it to a boy-scout level of douchebaggery (is that even a word? LOL). I did not think Jonah Hill fit in his role though, I think they could have chosen another actor with a better persona of what his character was. Will this movie be the next Avatar or Lord of the Rings? No, by no means will it ever be. Will this movie win any awards? No, by no means will it ever win any awards (perhaps maybe a small nomination, but no wins). It is also quite long, almost 3 hours.

DiCaprio is spectacular and i genuinely wonder HOW he didn't win an oscar for this. Jonah Hill also gives an incredible performance and so does Margot Robbie. The acting in general is top notch. It has all the usual style and elegance of Scorsese and well.. the movie is hilarious! Especially the scene where he lost his senses and had to stop his friend from talking to the phone was so amazing i almost choked laughing! Jordan's descend into madness, greed and addiction is shown in a hilarious way, without however overromantisising his hideous lifestyle as many claim, since his actions have direct consequences, and ultimately lead to his downfall. The only reason i don't give this movie a 10 is because i believe it drags on for a bit too long, and at one point it might be a bit too excessive. If you're willing to look past the runtime and if you don't have problems with usage of drugs or nudity, this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh! Solid 9.5/10.",

It added absolutely nothing to the movie. It was in very bad taste and completely unnecessary. I cringed for any in the audience who had a family member with cerebral palsy.

Anyway, after 2 hours, I have to say that I've started to look at the watch, because I was tired. That's it.

This is a movie pinnacle of a legendary career of great films. It's all so perfect like a well oiled machine. Here in another Goodfellas, Casino like movie, this time, Leonardo, driving the narrative, in a fantastic portrayal of money hungry, stockbroker/crook Jordan Belfort, in sure fire Oscar Winner mode, we see him quickly ascend to wealth, thanks to the 19th October 87 Wall Street slump. He revamps a chop shop on Long Island, where he basically retrains the employers and installs confidence in them, where soon they're living a dream of excess wealth of oversupplous partying and sex. There's a gluttonous amount of sex in this too, let me warn you, not that I have a problem with that. It's great how Scorsese has made this three hour film and story exciting, throughout, with many great performances, second to Leo's, Jonah Hill, as Belfort's right hand man and best friend, Donnie, and hot and strikingly impressive Margot Robbie from Oz as DeCaprio's new and seductive wife, who causes Hill to sort of unload. Matthew McConaughey has a small an unforgettable role at the start as a Wall Street giant, he truly leaves his mark here, as he's been doing with many other performances nowadays. A much stacked on Jon Favreau is good too. The Wolf Of Wall Street is very funny too, two scenes, one a trademark scene with De Caprio, smooth talking, bribing two FBI men on his boat, the other has a staggering Leo, trying to make it back to his car, after swallowing a Qualude at the Country Club, where the second time recounting, making it home, is not just a surprise, but almost side splitting. Violence runs short, save for two scenes, and there's quite a bit of drug taking, with a few foolish acts at the end of em' as you'll see. Here's one of the best movies I've seen in years, it's frightening to imagine Scorsese bettering this film. There will also be a director's cut, an hour more of extended sex scenes.

People all say Jonah Hill is great, but I'm not sure he can hold up such a big supporting role against Leo, with all due respect of course. I loved his small roles across the board which were all absolutely hilarious, but in this one, again, I think his role lacks depth too.

The Wolf Of Wall Street makes you wonder why there was a need to tell a story about a personality like Jordan Belfort. Jordan isn't a hero or a role model whose life should be celebrated or emulated. He made tons of money illegally, disrespected the law and the system, abused drugs and had multiple sex partners. There is no reason to why he did it and nothing extraordinary about how he did it. The movie is about Jordan having no limits. He did whatever he wanted and how much he wanted. There is no greatness about his life or a lesson to be learned.

'Money brings in all kinds of comforts as well as problems' has been brilliantly portrayed. The ensemble acting is very good.

Leonardo DiCaprio is yet again very good and is 20 years overdue for an Oscar. He did a very good job portraying Jordan Belfort, the drug abusing stock broker. I did feel a little uncomfortable with he many sexually explicit sex scenes. I did also feel that the movie was very repetitive. For three hours, we watch Leonardo DiCaprio abuse drugs, have sex and look like a jackass. That is about it. But Scorsese finds a way to make it work and to make it entertaining.

It is oddly like a drama by Christopher Marlowe, or one of the other lesser Elizabethan playwrights: there is no real plot line, no character development, but rather a constant and increasingly frenetic repetition of what has gone before. The self-indulgence of the whole is reflected in the performances. McConaughey's chest-thumping scene is painful to watch. Jonah Hill does his usual thing. Leonardo diCaprio smirks his way through the film, though admittedly that may suit the character. (But pity those early enthusiasts who referred to the 'lude scene as ""brilliant."") Bright spots are Kyle Chandler as the FBI agent; admittedly I may have liked him because I hoped he would arrest Jordan, and cut the movie short.

491,2 January 2014,cordenw,5, Good movie.... but too long,"Decaprio is at his ruthless best in this realistic Wall Street con story. You would think that this horse has been flogged to death over the past few years but every time they find another villain we are powerless to ignore the well worn plot. You would also think that the great unwashed would have cottoned on to the brokerage scam that is the engine of the industry but it's not so. There's still a sucker waiting to step over the body of the previous victim and hand over their money to a good conman.Suckers don't have to be working class either , they come from all levels of society and every one of them has the same motivation... they all want something for nothing. This movie homes right in on this motivation and portrays the sleazebags who take advantage of it perfectly (although it leaves the blue chip guys unscathed) I was disappointed in the acting of Jonah Hill and felt they overdid it with the coke,the ludes and the chicks, simply because a business wouldn't last that long with so many screw ups running things. I've worked with many of these types of characters so I can speak with a little bit of authority. At about two hours you start to fidget in your seat and wish they'd cut to the chase, but they string it out for another hour with meaningless fill, fill which dilutes some good performances. It's always fun to watch such displays of excess end up with razor wire in the final scenes.

502,5 September 2017,rahumate,9, Martin Scorsese has proved his given yet another masterpiece of different genre,"Scorsese The wolf of wall street ""I would wish for any one of my colleagues to have the experience of working with Martin Scorsese once in their lifetime."" These lines are from world famous by legendary actor Daniel Day-Lewis. Martin Scorsese who is famous for his noir films like Taxi Driver, GoodFellas, Departed and The Wolf of Wall Street. He handled many plots, time and social upheaval. Handling a character is his forte. Many directors from US work according to story and then create the character. Scorsese never give importance to story. This revolutionary director who make his film around the character, for him character is the most important factor. Film is about the character and his psychological landscape. His films offer us an exclusive glimpse of society, social scenario and its impact on character's mind. We surrender ourselves to the screen and scream with a character because we never realize when his character becomes our alter ego. The Wolf of Wall Street is a film about Jordan Belfort's memoir. Jordan Belfort who worked as stockbroker and who is convicted for stock market manipulation. He has spent 22 months in prison. Now he works as a motivational speaker. Jordan who was greedy for money and who committed many frauds to experience all his whims and fancies of as a mortal. In this film we find anxiety, emptiness and despair amid the rampage of group hysteria throughout the film. As Scorsese say, ""As you grow older, you change."" These lines come true when we watch films. This film showcases the characters of William Shakespeare's characters from tragedies and comedies. Representative stories of great men and their downfall, facing trial, drugs, daughter get kidnapped, car crash ultimately he become vulnerable. He realizes his self destructive urges. This showing us how the world works, everything comes up with a price. Belfort gets scared once he goes to jail. Thus the Machiavellian Belfort, an anti-hero of late-capitalist finance selling the lure of wealth as an alchemical panacea , may be our equivalent of Richard III or Iago - who also charm us and immobilize our moral instincts by taking us into the confidence of their villainous schemes. Rothstein has much in common with Shylock, hated by his Italian associates as a Jew, and finally incited to self-destruction by a contradictory human passion for family. conceivably the damaged and driven, yet heroic Hughes that Scorsese and DiCaprio showed us resembles Coriolanus - a mother- figure of immense power whose uncontrollable personal demons shape our destiny. We can call it a psychological capitalist epic. It could be compared with Citizen Cain. It is a film with a serious subject when we are living in the time of fast change. 2008 financial collapse of financial world made him make this film.",

I REALLY don't understand how Scorsese could even choose such theme. These people are idols of these days? Three hours to glorify such stupid and unmoral person is too much and the story was as much simple as it could be. I can tell the whole story in three sentences. I know the nudity could be very interesting for all men and boys but it was just TOO MUCH. It had no point and if I wanted to see so much sex I would see other type of movie. I was chocked by the age limit for this movie. Not for the nudity but because of the whole the message. Just have to have fun and spend the whole money for drugs and prostitutes the stupid ""normal"" people will pay it.

Desperate, he takes a job selling penny stocks, after finding out the commission he can make on these stocks he goes into business for himself. When he turns to duping rich people into buying these stocks him and his partner Donnie Azoff (Hill) become rich beyond their wildest dreams, but everything comes with a price. I am a huge Scorsese fan and am becoming a big DiCaprio one as well so I was really looking forward to seeing this. While the movie is 3 hours long it doesn't feel slow or drawn out and never actually felt like a 3 hour movie. If that is your reason to hesitate on it don't worry. While there is a ton of drug use and nudity in this it doesn't distract from the flow. All that said this is a real must see. There is drama, comedy, action, everything that makes a movie great. I can't say enough about this movie. The fact that this is based on a true story makes it even better. Do yourself a favor and watch this, you won't be sorry. Overall, a great experience and one that I will watch over and over. I give it an A+.",

516,19 November 2015,jammasta-1,7, Highly entertaining flick about a bunch of a-holes,"This is one of those Marmite things - a well-made, entertaining film that may still leave you feeling that you've just been conned out of your money. It follows the general pattern of Scorsese' ""Goodfellas"": we are invited to a vivisection of the twisted life-story of a thug, with all the accompanying over-the-top theatrics. Here, however, instead of ruthless perversions of a life of killing and crime, we get a life of coke, Quaalude, and sex. The pace is often unbearable, but well suited to the story being told. Which still doesn't change the fact that the film ultimately glorifies the oneupmanship of a petty thief without really batting an eye. As far as the artistic value is concerned, this is a notch or two below ""Goodfellas."" You can probably make the same movie yourself if you patiently scroll through Dan Bilzerian's Instagram. There's very little room here for reflection, not only in a moral sense (which I don't care much about), but also in the sense of the development of characters. DiCaprio is well versed in this kind of fare and his acting doesn't really stand out. (In fact, Jonah Hill may be the stand-out performer.) At times, this gets really depressing, as when Matthew McConaghuey easily upstages Leo during the briefest of cameos. Or when Rob Reiner basically embodies the generational (and ethical) difference between the con-men of the 80's and the wheeler-dealers of the 70's. This is also why the film can still satisfy. Other than the pure showiness and shallow theatrics, it does include some fine acting and writing. The rest is well summed up by that YT video of all instances of the f-word in the film.",

519,14 January 2014,PWNYCNY,10, A cinematic free-for-all with Mr. Di Caprio leading the way.,"What a wacky, goofy movie! This movie is a spoof on all the props that drive the United States on - capitalism, banks, stock brokers, family, friendship, religion. Nothing escapes the mockery of the director. It is as if the director was given a carte blanche to have his way and have his say with no holds barred. And in this movie, no holds are barred. It is a cinematic free-for-all, with Leonardo Di Caprio, in his greatest role, leading the pack. Di Caprio not only makes this movie happen, he IS the movie. His presence is so dominating that it is impossible to separate him from the movie and still have a movie. This is a case where the movie is both story driven and actor driven. True, the other members of the cast are wonderfully entertaining too, but they are support characters for the one star of the movie. Now, why is this movie so entertaining? Because it calls to attention and unmasks the phoniness of a system that purports to be the envy and role model for the world. It says to the audience, ""Behold, I am unclothed! Take me for what I am!"" Yet, the movie is not all goof; it also contains some disturbing scenes of a domestic nature which underscore the precarious and potentially violent nature of relationships. If one likes movies that take off the gloves and say it like it is, this the movie for you. If you don't like those kinds of movies, then watch it anyway; it may change your mind.",

That fallout includes drug addiction, broken relationships and yes a prison sentence. Anyway veteran and legendary director Martin Scorsese hams up this satire to show the world of the late 80's thru the mid 90's and how the world of wall street took off becoming a major power player. The wall street business became a pool and a scheme of crime and corruption that tied in both the corporate world and the banking industry. The film based on true events centers on Jordan Belfort(a role that Leonardo DiCaprio pushes to the edge)an up and coming young guy who all of a sudden becomes a wealthy and powerful stockbroker. And Belfort's methods and his rise to power involves bribes, schemes, and false bank accounts that are made for his customers and victim clients. The film has it all insider trading and false security tips still it makes Jordan a very very rich guy. Along with the life comes hard partying coke snorting, binge drinking, and a lot of sex with beautiful women mostly escorts still Jordan hooks a sexy trophy wife. And a man named Donnie(the super Jonah Hill)is funny and crazy as Jordan's partner in crime and top sidekick. Still the good times and high life brings the bad life of addiction and broken relationships all leading to a prison sentence. This is one picture that is a showcase on excess and indulgence showing that the good life can be lived up with highs yet the lows to come are evident as the wolf can only howl for so long and only to a certain point.",

In both a young man is seduced by the allure of ill-gotten wealth and the power, sex and glamour it provides. In both the man tells his story in candid voice-over. Both build to a manic drug-propelled climax. Both heroes turn rat to save themselves and enjoy a second life, though Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) fares better than Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) did. As the heroes are propelled by cocaine the narrative is driven by a pulsing rock score, though here Scorsese leans more on lesser known tunes and covers. Both films expose the amoral conventions and dishonesty of a tight subculture. And that's the point. Scorsese implies the American stock brokerage and banking world are now what the Mafia was in the 1990s. It's hard to disagree.",

560,20 January 2014,sjohnson134-878-955038,6, The Wolf of Wall Street Literature and Movie Review,"The 2013 film of Jordan Belfort's The Wolf of Wall Street novel begins with Leonardo DiCaprio breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly to the audience. He does this repeatedly throughout the film and if he is not speaking directly to the audience, he is doing lots of voice-over to explain or inform what he or the other characters are doing at that particular time/situation in the film. Most of the time, I find voice-over very distracting, but I have to admit that it works in this dramedy film very well. The book, written by Jordan Belfort, a former New York stock broker who earned hundreds of millions of dollar during the 1990s at his Stratton Oakmont brokerage firm on Long Island, New York (not really Wall Street in downtown Manhattan). The book is very long and seems to glorify everything Belfort did during this time of his life along with all of his friends and co-workers at his stock firm. He founded this firm which started as a penny stock firm, where unfortunately he defrauded everyday ordinary investors with fraudulent stock sales. Considered a stock swindler, he developed a very severe lifestyle, which included a very serious addition to Quaaludes. The company at one point employed well over 1,000 brokers and dealt with more than $1 billion stocks, including the Steve Madden show company. The 2000 film Boiler Room was inspired by Belfort and Stratton Oakmont. It should be noted here that Belfort was indicted in 1998 for money laundering and securities fraud. He spent 22 months in a federal prison and was to pay back $110.4 million that he swindled. Meeting Tommy Chong of Cheech and Chong in prison, Belfort was persuaded to write and publish his story, which he has. Stratton Oakmont was considered a boiler room that manipulated stocks. In the book, he tells in full detail how he did it from money laundering to swindling customers. Millions poured in, bringing with it many excesses, which included women, drugs, huge homes, servants, yachts, aircrafts, not only for himself but for everyone who worked for him. He also describes in detail all his dope escapades and sex, despite constantly telling the reader how much he loved his wives, particularly his second (and now ex-wife) and his children. Again, in full detail, he tells the reader about the supporting characters, from Aunt Patricia, his father who he calls Max Max, the Swiss forger, his cohorts in crime at Stratton, along with Steve Madden and others. The drug use, the sex, the violence, the storm at sea that destroyed his yacht, and the car wrecks are all listed throughout the book. It finally ends with Belfort being arrest and jailed. In the film, which is considered a black comedy, the story deals with the scam that Belfort initiated and where, or not, some, any, or all of what he tells the reader what he did during this time in the book is accurate remains to be seen. As is always the case with any film, plenty of creative license is used to tell a particular story. Seeing how Martin Scorsese, the director, in all his films, tries to be as faithful to the novel as he can be, he has done the same with Belfort's memoir. So this particular film is a close adaptation since most of the story elements are kept while some have been changed, added, or dropped. But, one has to be reminded that Belfort was a true scam artist, so just how much of his story is legit is up to the reader and now the watcher to decide. Most of what Scorsese has included in this film is accurate based on the book. Mark Hanna, played well by a still very thin Matthew McConaughey from his role in Dallas Buyer's Club, tells a very young Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) that the key to being successful included hookers, cocaine and masturbation is told in the novel. The use of what is called a pump-and-dump scheme (selling a risky stock at an inflated price and then sold the stock to make a profit for themselves) to make a profit is also accurate. Belfort and Danny Porush (Donnie Azoff in the film, played by Jonah Hill) did this. The brokerage firm did in reality take Steve Madden's shoe company public, which Madden, Belfort and Porush owned the stock, driving the price up. All three of them went to jail for this. The smuggling of the money that Belfort laundered in Switzerland was actually done by his wife's mother and English aunt. Prostitutes were hired and were billed to the corporate credit card and then these expenses were written off their taxes. The yacht, originally owned by Coco Chanel, was sunk. In the film, his second wife's name was Naomi; in the novel, her name is Nadine. In the book, Belfort gave up Porush, among many others for a reduced sentence. In the film, he tells Porush not to incriminate himself. It is true that Belfort was born in the Bronx to accountant parents and he was raised Jewish which he is still today. I guess the audience would like to believe that Belfort only stole from the rich. Truth be known, many small investors are still to this day trying to recover from his scheme while Belfort has failed to repay what he owes and Porush is still doing his get rich quick plans. Many of the characters; names from the book were changed. Danny Porush is Donnie Azoff, Patrick Denham (FBI agent) is in real-life Gregory Coleman, Denise Lombardo was changed to Teresa Petrillo and Nadine Caridi was Naomi Lapaglia. Chandler was the name of his first child, but was referred to in the film as Skyler. Scorsese did include at the end of the film a disclaimer saying it was a fictionalized version of the novel and in the film, some of the names had been changed.",
561,17 January 2014,jackasstrange,8, One of the most hilarious and ambiguous films ever,"No wonder, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the greatest hits this year, with all the controversies going on about its content, some claiming it a feast of profanities, a film without any message and a torn of the moral values. Others, claim it to be a masterpiece, and hilarious and entertaining all the way through, some even go as far and say it's one of the greatest films ever made well, it's very subjective what is a good and what it's a bad film, the only thing we can judge and evaluate for real it's the artistic merits. And well, since that a comedy is always played for laughs, so in fact, this film deserves a thumbs up. But no wonder(as well), this film has some kind of distorted notion of morality for some people, and I really can't put the fault of them, because if this film isn't glorifying what Belfort did, it's not bashing or judging it either(like most films do with their despicable villains). It's just showing how dirty he is and how everything works. Of course, excellent acting by Leonardo Dicaprio. His performance was thunderous and powerful, required to interpret someone that was 90% of the time under the effects of cocaine. Funnily enough, I still not figured out what this film main intention is. The profanities on it is what may bother some people, since that it has really a lot of swearing, it's almost impossible to heard two lines in a row without them. I kinda liked Jonah Hill as well, he was disgusting and certainly it's his best performance by far. Everything works well into the film. But as you can see, worth noting, I still not figured out what is this film about. I hope there is something more than just showing how the dirty world of the Wall Street works. For now, it's kind of an incognita. Being said, it's a good comedy film, with some hilarious scenes, and a good watch if you don't mind with the language (if there is a real complaint about this film, language is it, for sure, and I find worth noting to say that it's really strong). 8.9/10",
562,29 May 2019,jackamccallum,8," Energetic, Fast Passed and Indulgent: A Film on Drugs","The Wolf of Wall Street goes for three hours but by the end of the film it only feels like its gone for two. Martin Scorsese presents the audience with the fast paced, energetic, drug and sex fueled rise and fall of Jordan Belfort the wealthy stock broker who made millions off scamming people out of their money. Scorsese uses the movement of the camera, fast edits, snappy dialogue and the excess of Jordan's life including naked women, drugs and money to hook the audience into this world of indulgence. It fully emerges you into Jordan's world and shows just what exactly Jordan would do with his scammed millions. Leonardo DiCaprio brings a stellar performance as the drug fueled Belfort with him being calm and cocky for the most part until he doesn't get something his way or has a little to much of his drugs (the quaaludes scene being especially memorable) . The rest of their cast holds their own with Margot Robbie and Jonah Hill bringing their A game to the film with Robbie playing the no nonsense Naomi who stands her ground against Jordan and Jonah Hill as Donnie, Jordan right hand man. The film is funny, witty, fast paced and fun and shows just how insane Jordan Belfort's life was.",

My sister and mother came to town to visit me for the holidays and we went to my local dine-in theater to see this movie based on those things. We walked out with PTSD, almost vomiting, utterly appalled, disgusted, offended, saddened, and enraged. This was not a film about a man who took a wrong turn in life. This is an uncensored pornographic film with multiple orgies, prostitutes, and lots of homosexuality. It was all about greed, sex, money, drugs, and defying the law and not getting caught. The fact that a Christian website rated this so well enrages, and deeply saddens me. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT. Thankfully, God would not let your life depend on this film. This is not what He intends for his children. We are meant to be His hands and heart in this world and be a beacon AGAINST all of this sin. We are meant to be the ones speaking out with love to say that THIS IS NOT THE WAY, not applauding this. Not allowing this to be what we let our families watch. This movie should not exist.

It can't really explain the central character's decline into debauchery and self-destruction, so it is instead a kind of celebration of decadence. The humor is truly juvenile and the constant parade of sex rarely reveals character or furthers the plot. It seems more an opportunity for the director to explore his own pornographic interests.

582,23 July 2020,andrewroy-04316,8," A wild cinematic experience with great technical elements across the board, energy is The Wolf of Wall Street's currency","The Wolf of Wall street is a very well made film in all aspects, never dragging for a minute of its 3 hour runtime. It is a story of an exceptionally successful stock brokering and laundering scheme which inevitably falls apart. In some ways it does feel like Goodfellas in how it shows the allure and greed you see as people start getting away with things and reaping the rewards. The major difference comes in what I find to be their ultimate critiques and messages: Goodfellas shows the psychological struggle of crime, the duality of its thrill and its risk and how it can feel like an addiction to people. TWOWS spends very little time on Jordan's psychology; instead, we see how he puts on this magic act for us, how he connives people into giving him their money. The focus is subtly on the audience, on the people Jordan influences and the way they worship an undeserving idol. It is so easy to get swept up in the grand speeches and look at the crazy life and think it's so great, but in the end you see how his life was more an illusion of a perfect life than anything else. I would've found it interesting to delve into his greed and how his success changed his relationships with others, but I could also be convinced that it's a brilliant choice by Scorsese to eschew that common angle in favor of treating the audience like someone for Jordan to woo and play. Leo is absolutely fantastic here, and it's a great cast across the board. It does also feel like American Hustle as they're both fun, high-energy movies about con artists, but I do think TWOWS has a bit more on its mind. Very well done film, no big flaws to me.",
583,17 April 2015,veggieboycraig,1, Didn't deserve any of the acclaim it got,"This movie is comparable to a project x, or other teenage party flick. I am appalled that my generation, the generation of the future, considers this movie more deserving than the brilliant masterpiece, ""12 Years a Slave"". There are some films that can be riddled with profanity and still be great (case and point: ACTUAL Scorssese masterpieces such as ""Raging Bull"" and ""The Departed""), but that profanity isn't what's great about the movie as is the case with ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". This movie is filled with nudity and drug and alcohol use as are the popular movies with my acquaintances today, however, those movies don't deserve Best Picture nominations, and they don't receive them. Just because this movie is set against the backdrop of Wall Street corruption, doesn't mean it deserves anything. There are great movies about Wall Street, such as ""Wall Street"", but this movie is a sorry excuse for an Oscar nominee. As for the acting, DiCaprio and Hill have done much better. The best acting job of the year for DiCaprio was as Jay Gatsby in ""The Great Gatsby"", and although that film was plagued by many of the same problems as ""Wolf"" (too much partying and modernization) and was, much like ""Wolf"" bogged down by the societal need for action that has lead to a detriment of the art of film, DiCaprio gave a performance that was superior to Robert Redfords in the 1970s version. Mr Hill has showed us that he can make the transition to serious actor, as he did in "" Moneyball"", this performance is more comparable to his performances in ""This is the End"" and ""21 Jump Street"", as those are the same quality as this film. Altogether this film is just a stupid party promiscuity drug film set against a ""serious"" backdrop. Scorssese, DiCaprio, and Hill have all done MUCH better, and hopefully will do better in the future. Don't waste your time.",

The previews displayed a fun, maybe action filled, interesting movie, and Leonardo is one of my favorite actors, so we had to go. One of the first scenes in the movie shows Leo and a woman in bed, naked and using drugs. After seeing that scene I was a little hesitant on whether or not the rest of the movie was going to be better or not. Despite the vulgar and disturbing scenes we sat through hoping for a turn around. In between the unnecessary sex scenes, and promotion of drugs, Leo is a stock broker trying to make it big on Wall Street. The main point of this movie is the unrealistic promotion of drug use and the complete opposite of the truth in showing that drugs will not only benefit your life, but will give you the ability to make loads of money. In all of my years, I have never walked out of a movie, making The Wolf on Wall Street the first. Once I walked out I immediately realized that even though I looked away in most of the sex scenes, I should not have seen those images. Sitting through the movie was sad, and most of all extremely embarrassing. If you are a mom or a dad thinking that this movie is going to be a fun getaway for you and your child to enjoy together, it is NOT. DO NOT TAKE YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER TO SEE THIS.

Scorcese, for all he has done in film, makes films that center on violence, sex, and money. He loves gangsters and criminals because they are the greatest examples of the rough edges. However, Wolf of Wall Street is more interested in vanity rather than showing the end results of vanity in the financial market. Anyone with any knowledge knows that the people in this film were at the base of creating the environment that would eventually destroy the American economy.

In terms of plot, Terence Winter's screenplay contains the usual clichés associated with movies of this type: the emphasis on conspicuous consumption, the wanton disregard of Belfort and his fellow-stockbrokers for the feelings of those around them; the brazen belief that the world is their oyster. It is the kind of world in which Michael Douglas's Gordon Gekko would not seem out of place. Visually speaking, Martin Scorsese's film is a treat: the cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is stunning, with a series of fast cuts emphasizing the frenzied existence of those whose sole raison d'etre is the desire to make money. On the other hand, THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is far too long; there are too many moments where the characters exchange dialog without advancing the plot.

Jordan Belfort, the main character of the film is a real person who at one time spent 22 months in prison for fraud and money laundering. DiCaprio constantly consulted with the prototype of his hero. Such a thorough approach has borne fruit: according to Belfort, the circumstances of his life in the film are reproduced quite accurately, especially the scenes of drunkenness. The most poignant and exciting scenes of the film, the most improbable events took place in reality, including the fraud of the public, fabulous enrichment and subsequent problems with the FBI. Interestingly, ""The Wolf of Wall Street- is not the first film about the activities of the Stratton Oakmont company founded by Belfort: the first was the director's Boiler Room drama, but it is far from Scorsese's film in scope and naturalness.",

Even '12 Years a Slave' is inspired by a true story and biography but from the previous century. While I liked much less 'Dallas' I feel 'The Wolf' is quite comparable - both are remarkable movies, both throw light on some dirty and corrupt aspects of the American society, both bring to stage characters which use and trick the system at the same time.

While Henry Hill's story concerned life in the small time Mafia, Jordan Belfort, the protagonist of WOLF, was determined to be a high rolling stockbroker on Wall Street, where he could enjoy all the vices too much money could buy. While few have rated WOLF on the level of GOODFELLAS, I think it is one of Scorsese's most entertaining films, one with a tremendous rewatch factor. Some chided Scorsese for using his tried and true (and by implication, over used) bag of tricks to tell the story, from showy tracking shots, a soundtrack full of oldies (Laura Branigan's ""Gloria"" in Italian), to having Jordan break the fourth wall and directly address the audience at pertinent moments.

Martin Scorsese gives us more than we can handle in THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, where an insane amount of time is given to reminding us how boring life is when you're trapped living paycheck to paycheck. The film claims not to be glorifying the lavish life of a criminal but, c'mon, no one can watch this film without at least a handful moments where you wish it were you in the scene. It's a surreal, drug-fueled odyssey of one conman's rise to the top and the non-stop party that went with it. It's based on the real life experiences of stockbroker Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio, in the film), how he became a multimillionaire at the expense of others, and his ultimate downfall when the FBI finally close in on him. Jordan starts at the bottom with a powerful Wall Street firm and, when a market crash ends with his dismissal, Belfort uses the knowledge he gained from his coked-out mentor (Matthew McConaughey, in a short cameo) and gathers a rag-tag crew to open his own firm where he starts pushing penny stocks to postmen and eventually upgrades to one of the most successful firms in America. His rise to power is meteoric, his illicit practices rake in millions, and he celebrates in the most illustrious ways imaginable. Drugs, cars, women, and more drugsBelfort's love of excess and insatiable desire for money and power will eventually result in his downfall. In the meantime, it's one crazy ride.",

636,1 March 2014,royalewithcheese2020,5, Nowhere close to Scorsese's best,"A bit of an understatement, but it definitely has it's weak spots unlike the near masterpieces of the likes of Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and Casino. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" in a way, reminded me of Goodfellas and Scarface. Both stories about a man who rises to fame and fortune, only to fall by his own graces. But that is really the only comparison I can find between them. Other than that, all ""The Wolf"" is about is a drugged up stock broker named Jordan Belfort who inexplicably figures out how to make millions in the stock market, along with some other guys who pretty much also come out of nowhere. After one meeting with Matthew Mcconaughey's character, Jordan suddenly becomes a genius stock broker and drug addict. Jordan and his buds seem to be doing something illegal, and are being chased by an FBI agent, but it's never fully explained what exactly how are breaking the law. Basically, the movie is just complete style over substance. Though it was funny and Dicaprio was excellent, that was about all the movie had going for it. But either his character or any of the other ones gave us a reason for the audience to care about them. All they do is snort cocaine 24/7, have aimless sex, and somehow have no consequences. It's like a fantasy world where everybody is completely comfortable with this behavior. This could only happen in the movies. Basically the movie felt like an unrated version of The Great Gatsby, which also starred Dicaprio. That's probably the best way to summarize it.",

641,6 April 2014,Geeky Randy,10, Easily Scorsese's best in almost 20 years!,"Martin Scorsese is a rare director. When it comes to overall filmography-quality, the guy lacks any middle-ground. His praise is either rightly deserved or incredibly overrated. MEANSTREETS, TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL, THE KING OF COMEDY, THE LAST TEMPTATION, GOODFELLAS and CASINO, are just a few of his deservedly high-praised features; while GANGS OF NEW YORK, THE DEPARTED and SHUTTER ISLAND are all incredibly overrated. Notice how the rightly praised films are all pre-1996, while all his overrated films are post-1996. So, where, you might ask, does that leave THE WOLF OF WALL STREET? It appears Scorsese has climbed his way out of a slump to create a highly realistic portrayal of Wall Street corruption, with this tale revolving mainly around security-fraud. The memoir of the same name by Jordan Belfort (played by DiCaprio) was a huge inspiration to Ben Younger for his 2000 debut film BOILER ROOM, which is an excellent film in its own right starring late-1990s up-and-comers, but what WOLF delivers that BOILER ROOM lacks is what I'm coining as ""genre gumbo""—and if you do yourself a favor and watch WOLF, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about not to say that you shouldn't do yourself a second favor and also watch BOILER ROOM. Hilarious, cruel and intense; WOLF OF WALL STREET is an epic that is in full-speed from the very first shot, and ceases to slow down until the end credits. Easily Scorsese's best in almost 20 years! However, CASINO has had the privilege of having 19-years to grow on viewers; who knows what WOLF's replay value could be for all we know, it could be the best thing Scorsese has done since RAGING BULL. Only time will tell where it ranks on the Scorsese-classics (definitely higher than lower on the impressively long list); but one thing is for certain, there is no denying it is an immediate classic and possibly the best film of 2013.",

On a personal level I don't like movies that showcase debauchery as it does play an important part in shaping the thinking of the naive. Plus, at almost three hours, it was too long. The highlight is obviously Leo who has done a brilliant job, but , came nowhere close to Matthew McNoughley or the guy from 12 years a slave,this year.It would have been easy to predict that he wasn't gonna lay his hands on the Oscar this year , if I had seen it before the ceremony, therefore all the frenzy over the internet created by his fans,seems too far fetched. He deserved it for The Aviator and What's Eating Gilbert Grape....NOT THIS. Martin Scorsese, well, a living legend.... I wonder why he chose to do this film. The final plus point of this movie was Jonah Hill and his chemistry with Leonardo DiCaprio. The guy was funny and pulled off his role pretty well. Oscar winner,Jean Dujardin, was absolutely wasted.

DiCaprio recently won the Oscar for his role in the Revenant and to be honest he should have one for this movie instead as he gives an absolutely amazing performance as Jordan Belford who in reality is a piece of sh*t but he is a very entertaining character and steals the entire movie. Jonah Hill also gives the performance of his career with Donnie Azoff. The Wolf of Wall Street is also very entertaining which is surprising for a movie like this, but it really is particularly when Belford is addressing his employees and it's really quite inspiring and proves he does have some humanity to him. Another very good Scorsese film, Casino while fantastic relied far to much on narration to tell a story but The Wolf of Wall Street doesn't have that problem DiCaprio addressed the audience and it helped them enjoy the movie even more as it put them in the situation. Like I said this movie is absolutely hilarious for example the drug sequence featuring DiCaprio and Hill will leave you on the ground struggling the breath but it isn't all laughs and giggles this movie definitely has its dark moments when near the end of the film his wife (played extremely well by Margot Robbie) asks for a divorce and Jordan loses it and beats her then starts taking drugs leading to his daughter being injured. It's admirable that Scorsese chose not to ignore this, Belford was not a good person and this scene highlights that. With a movie that is 3 hours long it is perfectly paced very fast with just enough moment for you to breathe in between. Scorsese has outdone himself again and created in my opinion the best movie of 2013 and leaves me really wanting to see more of DiCaprio and Scorsese collaborations.",

Let me just say this film might have the record of F bombs dropped per minute in a film, 569 F words in total wich honestly, is kind of impressive. This is probably one of the most entertaining film I've ever seen, part of is probably the great acting by everyone, especialy Di Caprio in what is probably one of his best performances but also Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie who steals the show and should have been on screen for more time. The story is interesting espeacily the rising of Belfort's empire and it's also full of great moments, the best one probably being the part where Belfort and Donnie are high with Lemmon 714. However despite all of this this there is something that I can't quite put my finger on that prevents this film from being one of my favourites, nevermind, this film is great and massively entertaining.

All of Scorsese's movies are incredibly watchable; it's just easy to throw one of his films on and get swept up in the world he creates for you, be it 1870s high society New York (""The Age of Innocence""), the modern day crime-ridden streets Boston (""The Departed""), or a Parisian train station in the 1930s (""Hugo""). No matter what kind of film he makes, Scorsese brings his masterful direction to these stories in a way that simply brings those worlds to life, and this film, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", is perhaps his most insane offering to date; the parties Jordan Belfort hosts are wilder than those attended by Marcello Rubini (""8 ½""), he consumes more drugs than Hunter S. Thompson (""Fear and Loathing and Las Vegas""), and he gets into more debauchery than Loki the God of Mischief, and those reasons are exactly why I love it as much as I do. If there is a film that better demonstrates the allure and destructive powers of wealth, greed, and excess, I don't know what it is. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is Scorsese's funniest film, but it's also one of his most epic and brutally honest.",

697,23 January 2014,Sergeant_Tibbs,7, Wickedly satisfying.,"The pairing of Leonardo DiCaprio with Martin Scorsese is starting to make Marty's collaborations with Robert De Niro feel like a distant memory. As if Scorsese was a different filmmaker then and now an imitation of himself. But nobody stays on top forever and this is an apt contemporary substitute for the films on the highlight reel of Scorsese's career. That said, The Departed, DiCaprio's third and most successful collaboration certainly belongs among Scorsese's essential canon, it seems The Wolf Of Wall Street is quickly gaining a reputation of apparently deserving a spot too. The cashier at the cinema even said that the film makes his top ten, not of the year, but all-time. It ostensibly has a dedicated fan-base already. But that tends to be the appeal of such dark material in an energetic, pull-no-punches but gloss-it-up style. Written by Terence Winter, Wolf unfortunately doesn't have the sophisticated grace and tension of his television show Boardwalk Empire, but instead it's a bewitching manic tale of excess through an excessive perspective. It's self-indulgent. But this self is infamous maverick Jordan Belfort and his, note this, white ferrari. It's like Mad Men plus Looney Toons. It's wild as can be.",

That's long, and at points the film loses focus and wanders. Second: it's rated R, but the explicit amount of nudity, sex and drugs are tapping on the door of NC-17. However, ""Wolf"" is much more than these foibles. Bursting with life and youthfulness, ""Wolf"" is utterly and undeniably engrossing; a kinetic, spastic and hilarious peak behind the curtain of the debauch of America's top 1%. ""Wolf"" is the true story of Jordan Belfort, whose lack of morality helped make him and his friends some of the richest, shrewdest, and crudest brokers in the world. Every turn in the story is planted in some sort of sin, a chance to sell something to someone. And while the filmmakers are clearly condemning this behavior, in true Scorsese form he doesn't allow us to sit on our high horses above these people, but instead forces us into their environment, and at times even rooting for them. The performances are stunning. McConaughey is off-his-rocker brilliant. Hill is gone in his funny, neurotic role. At the center, Dicaprio gives his best performance to date, masterfully playing the monster behind everything with fervor and abandon. Add in the energetic editing and camera-work, ""Wolf"" contains some of the most memorable scenes of the year. This is first-rate, oddly refreshing filmmaking that sticks to your ribs. Scorsese has stayed current and relevant for going-on 5 decades, making films like an excited younger man is behind them.

This film is just so much fun: I've laughed more with this film than almost any other film intended as a comedy I've seen the last 10 years. It's too bad it didn't win any Oscars because it surely deserved them. But I guess that won't bother Marty or anyone else who will see this film. 'Wolf' might be the only true spiritual successor to one of my other all time favorites 'Wall Street' (forget Wall Street 2). DiCaprio and Scorsese make an excellent team and I hope we will get to see a lot more masterpieces from them in the future!",

Furthermore, once you have enough money to support 1,000 people comfortably, it's impossible to lose the respect of the American government or the majority of Americans.

My take is that the subject of stock market corruption could be better covered as a dark comedy in a similar style as Dr. Strangelove. Or the film could have been entertaining if the entire thing was covered from the perspective of the cops who took Belfort down. The way this film was made just makes me hate the world for producing such nastiness both in the real world and on the big screen. Not all films have to be happy.

Once the commercial ends, we get a glimpse into the company as it is: the scene opens to a raucous office hosting an orgiastic party complete with dwarf tossing, sex, alcohol and more than enough drugs to last a lifetime. Based on the true story of fraudulent stock broker Jordan Belfort, the film dives deeply into the heart of what is wrong with an economy that has embraced greed as a key component of the way it works. Where J.C. Chandon's Margin Call was a cool analysis of the workings of a system that is based on no substance whatsoever and Oliver Stone's second incarnation of Wall Street is a thriller depicting the workings of personal greed, Martin Scorsese presents the economy of greed as an orgiastic and never-ending feast that devours everything else, in which money is the drug of drugs and is equivalent with success, sex, life.

763,11 January 2021,briannanewton,10, How could you not give this a 10/10?,"The biographical crime comedy film is based on the book The Wolf of Wall Street published in 2007 by Jordan Belford himself, recounting his perspective on his career as a stockbroker. Martin Scorsese creates the true events in as much detail as possible, capturing the consequences of corruption, the difficult family environment fuelled by greed, drug and alcohol use. Jordan Belford wrote that he was greedy, and that ultimately that was his worst enemy, leading to his downfall. 'The Wolf of Wall Street' details the luxury life that comes with unregulated success, and the simplicity of getting there, but also highlights the pain and suffering away from the yachts, strippers and mansions, and the crumbling relationships, wanting more causes. The film begins in 1987, Jordan Belfort, mastered expertly by Leonardo DiCaprio, tastes his first 'Wall Street' experience when procuring a job as a stockbroker for L.F. Rothschild, employed under Mark Hanna, who quickly entices him with the sex-drugs-fuelled stockbroker culture and passes on his idea that a stockbroker's only goal is to make money for himself. Jordan soon finds his career terminated following Black Monday, the largest one day stock market drop in history, and takes a job at a boiler room brokerage firm on Long Island that specialises in penny stocks. Thanks to his aggressive pitching style and the high commissions, Jordan makes a small fortune. The seemingly exaggerated yet perfectly accurate portrayal of the 9:30 am work start on Wall Street is presented by Scorsese, showing the high demand of stockbrokers aiming to commission clients into earning large amounts of money for themselves. Belfort is overwhelmed at first by the working environment, but sees the long-term gains and is aware of the money he is able to make as a stockbroker, significant to the financial struggle he and his wife Teresa are experiencing. Jordan befriends his neighbour, Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) during an encounter at a diner, intrigued by Jordan's monthly profits, Donnie and he found their own company. They recruit several of Jordan's friends, whom Jordan trains in the art of the ""hard sell"". Belfort's tactics and salesmanship largely contributed to the success of his pump and dump scheme which involves inflating the price of a stock through issue misleading, positive statements in order to sell it at an artificially augmented price. When the perpetrators of the scheme sell their overvalued securities, the price drops immensely and those who were conned info buying at the inflated price lose a significant amount of money. To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable-sounding name of Stratton Oakmont in 1989. After an exposé in Forbes, hundreds of ambitious young financiers flock to his company. Jordan becomes immensely successful and slides into a decadent lifestyle of prostitutes and drugs. He has an affair with a woman named Naomi Lapaglia, who is played by Margot Robbie. When his wife Teresa finds out, Jordan divorces her and marries Naomi in 1991. Meanwhile, the SEC and the FBI begin investigating Stratton Oakmont. In 1993, Jordan illegally makes $22 million in three hours upon securing the IPO of Steve Madden. This brings him and his firm further attention to the FBI. To hide his money, Jordan opens a Swiss bank account with corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel in the name of Naomi's Aunt Emma, who is a British national and thus outside the reach of American authorities. He used the wife and in-laws of his friend Brad Bodnick, who have European passports, to smuggle the cash into Switzerland. We as viewers visualise the expansion of Belfort's business and the lifestyle that accommodates it. From such simple work that takes very little effort, making so much money is remarkable. However, we see the beginning of his arrogance in his affair behind his wife's back, the constant prostitution, drugs and parties. His attitude and overall behaviour is worrying, the greed drives the protagonist into becoming slightly ego-centric and self-centred, putting concerns of himself ahead of his wife and kids. The evolution of DiCaprio's character's first Wall Street encounter compared to now is extreme, and with the FBI closing in, the inevitable ending of Stratton Oakmont and for Belfort is imminent. Donnie gets into a public brawl with Brad, and, while Donnie escapes, Brad is arrested. Brad does not say a word about Donnie or Jordan to the police. Jordan learns from his private investigator that the FBI is wiretapping his phones. Fearing his son, Jordan's father advises him to leave Stratton Oakmont and lie low while Jordan's lawyer negotiates a deal to keep him out of prison. Jordan, however, cannot bear to quit and talks himself into staying in the middle of his farewell speech. The iconic speech takes place in the workplace, with Belfort standing in front of an audience of office workers, he states that he will be leaving, but soon realises what he is leaving behind, not only the opportunity to make more money, but Jordan almost feels his workmates need him and that the company would struggle to make large amounts of money without himself there. The stockbroker is too familiar with the business and his greed forces him to stay and grow the company even bigger than is already is. In 1996, Jordan, Donnie and their wives are on a yacht trip to Italy, subtly leading and monitoring the business away from the FBI, they learn that Aunt Emma has died of a heart attack. Jordan decides to travel to Switzerland immediately to settle the bank account. To bypass border controls, he orders his yacht captain to sail to Monaco, but the ship is capsized in a storm. After their rescue, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed when a seagull flies into the engine. Jordan takes this as a sign from God and decides to sober up. Key to this phase of the watch, the death of Aunt Emma is inconvenient to Naomi differently to how it is to Jordan, Belfort's concerns are centred around the bank account and the money kept by Emma, whereas Naomi grieves the loss of a loved one. As Jordan moves closer to his breaking-point and ultimate destruction of his company, he continues to move further away from his family. Two years later, the FBI arrests Jordan because Saurel, arrested in Florida on an unrelated charge, has informed the FBI on Jordan . Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency. Naomi tells Jordan she is divorcing him and wants full custody of their children. They get into a full-fledged argument with Jordan striking Naomi and snorting cocaine hidden in the couch cushions, and he tries to get into the car with their daughter but crashes into a brick pillar while pulling out of the garage. Later on, Jordan wears a wire to work but slips a note to Donnie warning him when in conversation. Donnie keeps the note and rats out Jordan to the FBI. Jordan is arrested for breaching his co-operation deal. The FBI raids and shuts down Stratton Oakmont. Despite the breach, Jordan receives a reduced sentence of 36 months in minimum security prison for his testimony and would be released after serving 22 months. After his release, Jordan makes a living hosting seminars on sales techniques, emulating the previous pen-sell on the audience that Jordan asks Brad in the early stages of creating Stratton Oakmont. Jordan Belfort continues to make a living out of motivational speaking where he mainly focuses talking about business ethics and learning from mistakes. Prison acted like a wake-up call to Jordan, keeping him sane and grounded. The easy life of being a stockbroker and having 'it all' was an addiction to Jordan, who enjoyed the luxurious lifestyle that matched, he forgets what is truly important in life: family and instead is fixated on the profit he was gaining. Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal earned the Best Actor award for the Golden Globes and nominated for the same awards at the Oscars. The Scorsese film, lasting for 180 minutes, pictures the fast-paced work environment on Wall Street and most importantly why Jordan indulged in the profession and wanted to build an occupation for himself.

781,2 April 2023,heathconnor,9, A Wild and Exhilarating Ride through Greed and Excess,"Martin Scorsese once again has done a fantastic job on making a remarkable film that will be appreciated 20 years from now. The story is obviously based on true story of a stock broker in Wall Street. Right out of the bat, this is absolutely a dark subject matter but colorful comedy story that makes you laugh your ass off. A lot of critics have complained it's just a repetitive and pointless film, well several things you need to concern, first if the nudity and profanity bothers you, this isn't your movie, and indeed, there is a lot of it in this film, and it gets worse and worse as the story goes along. However, you need to realize this shows the reality of these characters, it shows their greediness, it shows how the more they make money the greedier they become, and they want the same thing over and over again but just in bigger or stranger stage, it shows how much nothing matters to them, I mean absolutely nothing, it shows how much these people who used to be nothing now they are all everything and want everything with giving no crap to anybody else, that's the reason it can be repetitive to some people. The dialogue and narration are very smart and natural in this film, it's not just there to fill the gaps, and it's there to show the nasty nature of these greedy bastards and inside the protagonist mind. It shows how much fun these people were having and it's shown in hilarious and comic tone, but it's the truth, I personally think the laugh at these situations are more affective than in drama tones, be you ask yourself ""Am I laughing at someone's stealing money and ruining someone's life?"", the audience feel more guilty, and that's the point but it is not represented the usual and cliché way, which is why it's difficult for some to approach this with a comic tone. Regarding the performances, oh my lord, Leonardo DiCaprio brings his best performance of his career, prepare to be amazed by that; Jonah Hill absolutely deserves a nomination; Matthew McConaughey, oh my god, he's there in three or four scenes, and he kills it all - also I think he was getting prepared for Dallas Buyers Club; Margot Robbie astonishingly a beautiful and hot woman and talented actress, watch out for her in the next couple years – Aussie actresses are pretty talented honestly. The soundtrack fits the film so well, I just wish they would have released the end credit track that Matthew McConaughey hums, it's pretty awesome – FYI, that single improvise make two other scenes to be awesome in the final act. I also think the pacing and editing is absolutely fine; the three hours was gone quickly for me, I was so absorbed that I only looked at the time to make sure that I've been really laughing and enjoying this for 2.5 hours.",

He is different and he is amazing. I believe that people who didn't like this movie are stupid and they do not have a good taste of movies. The build up was amazing.

It regards the pursuit of power particularly over those of lower status who fall victim to the deceitful exploits. DiCaprio plays stockbroker Jordan Belfort who rises to the top of the stock market using his ability to pitch sales entwined in deceit to merge ahead. He coaches other low income nerds and eventually they go from being on the low payroll to forking in thousands a week. Belfort divorces his wife in favor of the gorgeous Naomi. He has a large mansion, a helicopter, and a massive yacht. He also has the FBI veering in sending Belfort's confident demeanor into paranoia. If there is a flaw then it's the handling of Belfort as a father, which seems to come suddenly and becoming almost an afterthought until a crucial climatic sequence. DiCaprio gives Scorsese another brilliant turn as someone high on money, greed and drugs, which leads to a hilarious drug and drive sequence that further accounts to his downfall. Jonah Hill is scene stealing amusing joining Belfort in the promise of wealth and drugs. Margot Robbie is beautiful as Belfort's frustrated wife who grows weary of his down spiral exploits. Matthew McConaughey appears briefly as a broker who trains Belfort. Rob Reiner is given the small but pivotal role as Belfort's father who warns him to quit while he is ahead. The wages of sin is death even if it is via reputation. Score: 9 / 10",

I made a huge scrap with a rake. Here's where I get stupid. I saw how easily the car could get scratched so I proceeded to carve my initials on the lower part of the door. My Mom the next day was so outraged (and rightfully so,) She began yelling at me in the kitchen as the ring of the telephone saved me from further verbal ambush. He facial expression changed instantaneously. He voice lowered to a pleasant tone as her girlfriend from Hadassah discussing an upcoming event. I figured I would just leave the room but My mom looked at me and put her hand up to signal to stay put. We watch the rise and fall on one of the most prolific and glutenous individuals in the world of stock trading Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio). Director Martin Scorsese goes to no expense to grab your attention and hold you through the rise to Mount Everest and the fall to the depths of the Mariana trenches. Watching our leading man was like watching a real life cartoon character who escapes serious injuries and drug overdoses and always comes back in the next scene minty fresh. Belfort's second Wife Naomi (Margot Robbie) with eye popping sex appeal despite the heavy NEW YAUK accent makes you think twice about the significant your with now. Love the scenes with the Naomi holding a cup of water ready to splash it in Jordan's face during a morning argument. Other characters in the film are Jonah Hill (Donnie Azoff) as Jordan's second in command at the brokerage house. Jonah portly and known for his reserved demeanor in most of his works shows a completely out-of-control character who is a Quaalude addict and gold fish swallowing spontaneous lunatic. Pratt falls and chocking scenes show the demanding physicality of that role as your waiting for Azoff to have a massive heart attack at any minute.Another example of a cartoon figure who after every death defying scene bounces back and always regains normalcy in the following scenes. Another player in the film is the suave Swiss banker Saurel played by Jean Dujardin who is sweet as Swiss chocolate at the beginning of the film but at the end throws Jordan under a Swiss bus. Finally we come to another surprise guest in the picture as do my eyes deceive me? Patsy from the British Comedy Absolutely Fabulous. Joanna Lumley as Aunt Emma who is strangely related to the unpolished Naomi makes her grand entrance (but a bit tardy) at their Wedding reception. Jordan takes a shine to her but only as beard to deposit money from the firm in a Swiss bank account under her name. Joanna looks like a fine aged wine despite the years. lovelier than ever with an elegance to match. For additional contrast, Jordan's Father, Rob Reiner who has a scene where he is at home being interrupted by a telephone call. Yelling and complaining about missing the beginning of his favorite television show he wonders what is so important at this moment? Then in mid steam, he changes his facial expression, picks up the phone, answers the voice in kindly way with an ""HELLOW!"" which reminded me how Mother dealt with interrupted phone call during the heat of battle. Great direction in a make out scene between the very young DiCaprio and Lumley. So many twists and turns you wonder if it all happened. Guaranteed, you'll be pinned to screen throughout the movie wondering how anyone survived this money roller coaster ride. I give this one 6 stocks out of ten",

Though 'The Wolf Of Wall Street (2013)' never does much to punish the people who perpetrate greedy acts of criminal grandeur, it also never flinches from the unglamorous sides such an immoral life undoubtedly produces and, as such, allows the audience to decide whether or not they condone what they see (though it's pretty obvious they shouldn't).

Anyways, many critics are enamored with Martin Scorsese's stockbroker saga ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" while many others have called it a despicable, slimy ruthless flick. I am with the former. Undoubtedly, this is the most entertaining movie of 2013, even with its outlandishness and all. The narrative is based on the real life exploits of stockbroker Jordan Belfort, who rose to riches in the stock trade but not without a few corruption trips to the market, if you get my thrift. Belfort was also an avid drug addict, with his preferred drug of choice being the quaalude; yep, Jordan was definitely a boy in the lude. Oh! Jordan was also profoundly hooked on hookers; so he got plenty of action ""under the Belfort"". Leonardo DiCaprio's magnetic performance as Belfort is Oscar-worthy and it's a shame Leo's stock has not risen enough to be a frontrunner for the Best Actor Oscar chase this year. DiCaprio knocks it out of the ballpark! Jonah Hill was outstanding also as Belfort's right hand man of corruption Donnie Azoff. Hill should also be in the moneyball I mean money for a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Other stock worthy supporting performances rose from Kyle Chandler as an FBI Agent chasing Belfort's wrongdoings, Rob Reiner as Belfort's sympathetic father, and Matthew McConaughey with yet another scene-stealing performance as a Belfort mentor. Margot Robbie was not extravagant as Belfort's second wife Naomi, but Robbie did not rob me of any eye candy viewing. Terence Winter's screenplay was sure a wonderland of outrageous entertainment. And what can you say about the legendary Scorsese. He has delivered again in vintage Marty form. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" reminded me of Scorsese's ""GoodFellas"" with a stockbroker corruption landscape.

817,10 October 2014,851222,9, What was the point / moral of this picture?,"The Wolf of Wall Street is a film that often gets misconstrued by its audience. This is a movie filled with dark humor, greed and ego. This films shows us all the enticing sides of the lifestyle that Jordan Belfort lives and Martin Scorsese makes this satire legendary. The performance throughout the picture by Leonardo DiCaprio is my favorite from him and one of my favorite performances out there. The rest of the cast is amazing and perfectly plays their parts in the world they have created. The pacing throughout this film by Scorsese just shows his mastery as he makes a 3 hour movie feel like 2. The subtle fourth wall breaks in this movie help the audience follow along with the more complex nature of the stock world. The character study of Jordan Belfort shows us how someone can be corrupted by the luxuries they are shown and have been promised. For the plot of this picture we follow Jordan Belfort as he rises the ranks of the stock world eventually becoming ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". This film shows us his lifestyle in all its glamour and glory but also contrasts this with money hungry characters. Every character in this film is in it for thier own benefit and they do not care who they hurt along the way. This is a great film about how one can be corrupted by what they seek.",

It should have been at least 30 minutes shorter.,

Scorcese is known for taking films to another level, and he certainly does that here. The 3- hour film flies by with the drugs, booze, and more drugs as we see how corrupt Wall Street can be. This is Scorcese's craziest film to date, and that is surprising with his impressive filmography. ",

831,5 May 2014,jadelowrey,1, Easily the worst movie Scorsese has ever made.,"Whilst not a film for everyone, this production really does deliver a punch. DiCaprio is absolutely compellingly right for this role - really gives him opportunity to show his range and ability. Who knew that you could fall down a short flight of steps in so many ways! Full marks to the screenplay/writing. Everything has a natural flow and feels right for the period. Supporting actors are well chosen and are worth following throughout....hidden 'back stories can be detected' via these characters - quite a feat given how 'busy' the main story is. Saying that, however, you will occasionally check your watch....how much more of this do we have to watch.....well, that gives the other side of the Wall Street/Investments story. To con their marks the whole lot of these people resort to stimulants, uppers, downers, anaesthetisers and all manner of other anti-social kicks. Reality seems a long way from where these people go. And so it was.",

This movie is just awesome, fun and entertaining! This movie is 3 hours long and I felt like this movie was only hour and a half long. It was so damn entertaining! Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill delivers an amazing performance. The plot is nice. It really show how life is. How Jordan Belfort forgot everything and do everything for money, and live by his fortune and fame and he forgot all his life before. This movie represents how money can destroy people very well. Martin Scorsese just directed another masterpiece! One of his best! Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorses is just a great collaboration! Their work is so good. Everything in this movie is just right!

835,16 April 2014,genebpp,10, Another great masterpiece by Scorsese!,"The Wolf of Wall Street is a fantastic movie with a very well well developed storyline, an outstanding cast and very impressive character development. Its an unexpected film from both Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio to do, it's absolute filth without a doubt and has an 18 rating for a reason, but I think exploring these dark themes captured the true story of Jordan Belfort in a very realstic way, it took you deep in to his life in an intense manner to convey to the audience how surreal it really was, they were given creative freedom to do whatever they wanted and they certainly use this to full effect, without sugarcoating anything. There isn't a single performance in this movie I didn't enjoy, everyone gives it their all, DiCaprio delivers one of the highlights of his career, Jonah Hill's performance was definitely the funniest, and he has also has many intense and dramatic scenes where he proves once again that he can do serious roles and go beyond comedies like Superbad or 21 Jump Street. Margot Robbie was also one of the best actors on this film, she is very new to Hollywood but she seemed very confident, she is a very promising young actress who has a great career ahead of her. Matthew McConaughey also does a great job, he has been proving lately that he really can act in some big and challenging roles, he is in this movie for a very short period, but it's one of the best few minutes of the whole film and sets the tone perfectly, would have loved to have seen more of Mark Hanna, it says on the trivia that he spent two more years working with Belfort, sadly that didn't happen in this film, which I think would have been great to give him more screen time, his performance was outstanding. The only real problem I have with this movie is that the characters are very unlikeable, although this did make sense, we could have had some moments where we sympathised with them, and also it is a little bit longer than it really needs to be. Wolf of Wall Street is an outstanding movie that I would recommend to all moviegoers of a certain age. ",

I have always admired the films that have come out of the mind of Scorsese, and this film is no exception. What surprised me though is that there were actually quite a few laugh out loud moments in this film, which is a first for me when it comes to Scorsese, because most of the films that I have seen of his tend to be deadly serious. While this film is itself serious, there is quite a lot of light hearted moments, and I must say that DiCaprio has certainly come a long way since the days of his want to puke teenage characters. However, if you do take a look at most of the films that DiCaprio has been in it is quite clear that he is interested in taking the decent rolls in the decent films.",

He starts his own firm and starts making a lot of money. Not always legally i might add. He spends his money on a cocktail of booze, hookers and cocaine. This is a very fast paced life style. The film feels that way all the way through. Even though it is 3 hours long. Not for one minute is this epic slow or boring.You have to be prepared to see a lot of sex and drugs and violence. If you've seen a few Scorsese films I am sure you will know what your in for. The film is also very funny. A lot of laughs. This is also one Leo Dicaprio's best performances. He is funny, cocky and just so fun to watch. There is one scene where he has a delayed reaction from drugs which is so funny i was nearly out of my chair. Also great performance from Jonah Hill and a star making role from Margot Robbie.. an Aussie actress that plays Jordan's wife. This is a great film, fun all the way through.

The movie tell the life of this man and all the method to sell and how he started the business. And how his work an to gain money become an obsession ( aversion of poverty). We see the fancy rich life of this man and all the greed arround: sexuality, drugs, money, corruption, power. We see also the police investigate into his business and will have more problem because some things of Belfort's business was not really legal. So a hide and seek with the police will take place. I dont really know if Belfort was like this in his real life but i did find the movie pretty interesting and show some honesty about some stuff and the relationship. Basically we see the relationship arround Belfort, how he gains money, the parties, his friends, the problems and finally his arrestation by the police for 36 months and the divorce with his last wife. And he becomed someone really interesting because of his selling methods i guess. I found the movie crazy and interesting at the same time and really describe how greedy that man was even if he got legal issues in business. Interesting movie.",
