0,29 April 2005,evanston_dad,10, Majesty in the Desert,"The moment David Lean makes you aware you are in the hands of a master comes early on in ""Lawrence of Arabia."" Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) holds a lit match close to his lips and with one quick puff of air blows it out. Before the action is even completed, however, Lean has cut to a shot of a desert vista, with the sun slowly rising over the lip of the horizon. It's one of the most famous elliptical edits in cinema history, second maybe only to the bone/spaceship cut in ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" And it's only the first of countless memorable moments in ""Lawrence of Arabia."" The appeal of David Lean epics has always been his ability as a director to maintain an equilibrium between the scope of his films and the characters in them. Character development is never sacrificed to massive set pieces or knock-your-socks-off action sequences. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" has these elements too, but at heart it's a character study of one remarkable man. Lean seemed to understand that impressive landscapes alone are not inherently interesting; but if you place a fascinating character among those impressive landscapes, you can have movie magic.",/
1,15 June 1999,rupie,9, a memento from the days when they made real movies,"It is, in a way, depressing to watch this movie today. One winds up contrasting it with the sort of technologically slick and aesthetically shallow spectacles, like ""Titanic"", that garner the sort of adulation that a truly great movie like ""Lawrence"" received in its day, and one realizes how far we have fallen.",r
2,10 July 2018,maureenmcqueen,10," Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, what a treat!","Did you know that Cary Grant had been approached to play it? Yes, as well as Albert Finney and that made a lot more sense but it was Albert Finney who said, have you considered Peter O'Toole? Who? - Yes, I love that story. It goes to prove that certain things are meant to happen. I'm sorry if I'm going on about it. But I saw Lawrence Of Arabia for the nth time in a 70mm print in a crowded theater and what came across as the one major reason this film will be relevant forever is Peter O'Toole. His performance is timeless because it is unique. Cinematic and theatrical but always true. David Lean brilliantly created a sense of intimacy in O'Toole's eyes within the vast, arid landscape. I know the film has its detractors. I heard once director Michael Apted call it a ""silly movie"" Wow, I had Michael Apted's quote in my mind when I saw the film last and for the life of me, I don't know what he meant. I love this film.",e
3,23 May 2004,MidniteRambler,10, Simultaneously personal and panoramic,"Sweeping, epic and literate version of British adventurer and soldier T E Lawrence's experiences in Arabia during the First World War. Lawrence, miraculously well played by Peter O'Toole, ""went native"" when sent into the desert to find Alec Guinness's Prince Feisal. Before long he was striking out himself against the Turkish Ottoman Empire, which still held sway in the region at the beginning of the last century. Lawrence's efforts to unify the various Arab factions are particularly prescient.",v
4,12 July 2018,caseyt-48511,10, A True Must See,"""Lawrence of Arabia"" is either the greatest movie ever made, or the second greatest. The true power and scope has only been matched by few other films. It is a film that really does stand the test of time. In an age where special effect driven films are king(as much as i like those), it is great to watch a film where you truly see thousands of people charging a fort on horse, and camel, back.
It's a long ride, but it is never boring. It is full of fantastic characters acted out by even better actors. Peter O'Toole should have won every acting award available to win. His performance is consistently ranked among the greatest in movie history.",i
5,26 January 2005,iain_connell,10, Still my personal favourite,"I first saw this film on its release, aged 13, and it forms an important part of my transition towards adulthood. I am pleased to see that it consistently rates 20something in the IMDb listings, even from others (whom I envy, for I can't see it with fresh eyes) who are seeing it for the first time. Pleasing too is that some of those are also teenagers, for whom a forty-three year old film must itself seem part of the past. As for the minority who are bored by intentionally slow pacing (and for whom punctuation, paragraphing and grammar are a lost art), I suggest they learn a little about the history of film-making (from which it may become apparent that much of today's fast editing techniques were invented in the 1920s: try Eisenstein's October, for example).",e
6,29 June 2019,Instant_Palmer,10, David Lean's Masterpiece is a Cinematic Treasure (now in 4K UHD!) 💯,"The film that inspired Steven Spielberg to pursue a career as a film maker for good reason - 'Lawrence of Arabia' is a cinematic treasure - the greatest ""Epic"" movie, and one of the 5 greatest films ever made by almost everyone's standard.",w
7,18 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10, Quite simply movie-making on the grandest scale,"At 17, I love David Lean, his films are filled with beautiful images and he also directs with real flair.

8,29 November 1999,Nazi_Fighter_David,10, A film that literally excites the senses...,"David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is one of the few films that legitimately deserves to be called great It appears on virtually all ""ten best"" lists and reveals deeper layers of meaning with repeated viewings ",r
9,21 November 2009,AlsExGal,10, A sweeping epic with many layers of complexity,"It's hard for the small screen to do justice to such a sweeping cinematographic epic, but there is much more to this film than its visual majesty. The film has one of the most beautiful and recognized scores in the history of cinema, a fascinating subject in the person of T.E. Lawrence himself, one of the most literate screenplays ever written, and a wonderful supporting cast nearing perfection. It is a shame that unless you take the time to buy the DVD and invest the almost four hours it takes to watch it, you are likely to miss out on one of the best films ever made. It is precisely because of its length that it is seldom seen on TV anymore. The backdrop of the film is that the British, in the midst of fighting World War I, are aiding the Arab struggle for independence from the Turks since anything that ties up the Turks accomplishes the British goal of destroying the Ottoman Empire and thus aids in the war effort. T. E. Lawrence is first enlisted to help advise the Arabs in their military goals, but goes on to lead them in a series of stunning military victories that goes way beyond what the British expected of the Arabs, and quite frankly, way beyond what the British wanted. You see, the British had designs on claiming Arabia for themselves after the war ends, years before it was discovered that Arabia was sitting on the world's richest oil supply.",w
10,19 February 2007,bkoganbing,9, A Complex Man In Epic Events,"Although having just watched Lawrence Of Arabia again though I am bowled over by the size of the epic, I still can't believe that for the entire length of the film, the word oil was not mentioned.

14,2 March 2001,bleakeye,10, Heroism brilliantly shown,"When it come to making epics, David Lean is the master and what better proof than this masterpiece.  ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" was first shown in 1962 and after almost 40 years later, it is still beautiful.  The story of T. E. Lawrence is wonderfully brought to us by David Lean, director of another masterpiece called ""The Bridge On The River Kwai"".",8
15,2 May 2006,kenjha,8, Landscape of Arabia,"The story of T. E. Lawrence as he fights for the Arab cause becomes a sprawling screen epic, magnificently photographed under the keen eye of Lean. The film made O'Toole a star and boasts an all-star. This is a fine film, but is extremely overrated. The plot, what little there is of it, is generally uninteresting and rambling, causing the middle part of the film to drag terribly. An hour or so could easily have been trimmed from the middle, thereby producing a tighter and more compelling story. The acting is uneven, with Guinness underacting and Quinn overacting as Arabs. Ultimately, though, the cinematography and score manage to compensate somewhat for the weaknesses in the script.",0
16,24 August 2005,nisitpav,10, The best movie of all motion picture history,"I first watched ""Lawrence of Arabia"" when I was about 11 years old.

17,17 June 2006,ccthemovieman-1,8," Memorable Visuals, Sound & Acting, Yet It Peters Out","I'm doing this review despite not having seen the movie in a number of years but what I remember best is some fantastic desert cinematography from the point when ""Lawrence"" (Peter O'Toole) arrives in the desert until about the last third of this 3-and-half-hour film. There are just numerous spectacular desert scenes and, of course, this was a must to be seen in widescreen. Fortunately, that has been available for many years, even on VHS. Between the direction of David Lean and the photography of Freddie Young, this is a fabulous visual treat, one to be treasured.",/
18,3 October 2004,poofta1970,10, I am totally gobsmacked!,I am totally amazed by some of the negative responses to this film. Yes it is a long film; a very long film. Perhaps this is a symptom of the short attention spans of people today. But you know what? I wish it was 3 or 4 times longer. Every time this film finishes I compare it to the badly acted special effects laden rubbish that passes for 'epic' cinema these days and wish that T.E Lawrence had his motorcycle accident at 93 (rather than 47 as he did in 1935) so I could have had more of Peter O' Toole's electrifying performance.,?
19,20 February 2014,SnoopyStyle,10, One of the greatest movie of all times,"T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) has a minor function in Cairo during WWI. Nobody really cares about the Bedouin uprising against the Turks except for Lawrence and the Arab Bureau. He's sent for 3 months since he would be of no great lost. He learns the ways of the desert, and memorably encounters Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif) at a well. He finds Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness) harassed by superior weapons, and the British unwilling to take Aqaba from the sea. So Lawrence proposes to take Aqaba from the desert and Feisal gives him 50 men.",r
20,21 November 2014,Leofwine_draca,7, Wonderful cinematography and a worthy epic to boot,"David Lean's LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, a 4-hour desert epic telling the true story of T. E. Lawrence, a man who united the Arab tribes against their Turkish enemies, is considered an epic for a reason. It has wonderful vistas and backdrops brought to life by some splendid widescreen cinematography; it boasts a stirring score and stunning production values in which everything is catered for. It's the kind of film that makes modern movie-makers, with their green screens and CGI armies, look lazy.",e
21,5 February 2007,Robert_duder,8, I know it's a classic and it's easy to see why but here's why it isn't perfect,"I finally decided to watch the classic Lawrence of Arabia in my attempt to catch up on film classics I have never seen. Now I don't for one minute intend on talking down about this film. It is easy to see why Lawrence of Arabia stands the test of time as a classic. The absolutely stunning breathtaking cinematography, the incredible 'would be' special effects that probably had to be done with man power and the thousands and thousands of extras used in stunning battle scenes and traveling across the desert. You can't get more spectacular than the scenery in this film. Hands down a huge 10/10 for what they did with the cast and scenery. The story is simple enough and based on a true story of World War II British soldier who finds himself conflicted on who he is truly fighting for when he becomes entangled with the Bedouin armies of Arabia. I also realize that this is an epic and that being said and being filmed in the sixties, historical epics were known to be lavish productions. I watched this film on a 2 disk DVD and at the end of the first DVD I was so pleased, I almost wanted to watch it again and again and slap a perfect score on it. I would have been just as happy to have it end right there. But as it turned out there was another disk with an hour and a half on it adding the total running time to an outstanding 3 1/2 hours and I have nothing against that unless it's not necessary. I found the last part of this film very unnecessary, it dragged, it bogged down the story and I found it quite confusing. Yes I understand that it brought about T.E. Lawrence's conflicted opinions about the war but it just almost felt like an anti-climax and sadly brought the film down for me.",f

It leaves me with the feeling that I would have liked to have met Lawrence but being born 37 years after his death regrettably this will never happen! I went to see the movie in the National Film Theatre, London in order to see the panorama on the big screen. Well worth the trip even if you have seen the movie on DVD. He was arguably one of the greatest englishmen to walk the earth. Why doesn't anyone make films like this anymore?! Thank God for David Lean's work. Looking forward to viewing this film again and again on DVD.",t
25,5 June 2013,Lechuguilla,8, Visual Grandeur,"Everything about this film is bold, clean, striking, vivid -- most apparent in the magnificent visuals. The landscape might as well have been Mars. Desert scenes convey a wonderful sense of sterile beauty, pristine and natural: blowing sands, the sun, the sky, and not much else, uncluttered by modern techno-jumble that renders cities ugly by comparison. The presence of a few humans on camels magnifies the grandeur of this spiritual place.",t

27,17 June 2015,ma-cortes,9, Expensive and breathtaking screen adaptation of enigmatic adventurer and military T. E. Lawrence,"Mighty motion picture of action and adventure deals with Thomas Edward Lawrence , following this brilliant , flamboyant and controversial British military figure and his conflicted loyalties during wartime service . He was renowned for his liaison role during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, and the Arab Revolt against Ottoman Turkish rule of 1916–18 . This blockbuster is a huge accomplishment in every respect . It is a groundbreaking epic that is also literate and intelligent . Tremendous scenes , spectacular battles , intense drama , lots of action and awesome production design and art design from John Box and John Stoll . Still , the only way to really appreciate it turns out to be in Super Panavision and on big screen . Overlong though still knockout and resulting to be an immortal film . Based on T. E. Lawrence's book , ¨Seven pillars of wisdom¨ with interesting screenplay by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson . The breadth and variety of his activities and associations, and his ability to describe them vividly in writing, earned him international fame as Lawrence of Arabia . Peter O'Toole is splendid in his film debut , and made him an instant star . Colorful and impressive cinematography in Technicolor by Freddie Young . Unforgettable and classic musical score by the great Maurice Jarre . Lavishly produced by Sam Spiegel and masterfully directed by David Lean who bring us an overwhelming show delving deeply the complex personality of the British , semi-Arab leader who led the revolt against Turkey in WWI . Reissued in 1989 , a stunning version which restored a lot of cuts made over years . As many scenes of dialog were missing and as a result Peter O'Toole and a number of living principals returned and re-recorded dialog from more than 20 years previously . An ultimate thinking people's spectacle .",u
28,13 November 2018,CubsandCulture,8, Runs out of steam in the 2nd half as the main character gets simplified,"Undoubtedly this is very good film. Filled with iconic images, scored with some of the most rousing music and anchored by O'Toole's deeply charismatic performance this is the film most people think about when they hear epic film making. If the 2nd half was as engaging as the 1st half I would wholeheartedly agree. As it stands I only halfheartedly agree. The 2nd half runs out a steam as the screenplay repeatedly decides to make Lawrence fit into the disillusioned soldier tropes. Worse the tensions and ironies of the character, say his love-hate relationship with violence, slowly and surely get resolved. By doing so the film is robbed much of narrative momentum.",r

Putting it quite simply, it's one of the greatest movies ever made, featuring sterling work done by everyone involved. With LAWRENCE, Lean hit the summit of his directorial career ~a very high bar to set~ and took home his second Oscar for his efforts. Steven Spielberg was once quoted as saying that it was LAWRENCE OF ARABIA more than any other motion picture that inspired him to become a filmmaker.",

Nowadays epic merely means lots of CGI and anyone with a working knowledge of computer software could in effect create an epic film on their laptop .

38,3 March 2013,denis888,1, Most Overrated Piece Of Terrbile Cinematography,"Why on earth is it considered one of the best? Can anyone explain this mystery to me? The film is just awful - outdated, slow, clichéd, skewed, biased, unrealistic, propaganda-driven, silly at times, overtly naive and very very long. Peter O'Toole? Can he play? He can. Not in here. Here, his uneasy array of homo-hints, blank stare, evidently weak acting, very unnatural emotional display, shallow delivery and generally very irritating mimics. Omar Shariff and Alec Guinness are no better with their laughable gestures, bad lines and unconvincing acting. This is a very overrated piece of time movie, which belongs to where it should be - in the past, as a result of very poorly executed epic saga ewhich drags and dies along. My advice - watch it, but then drop it. There are better movies in this world... THis one is a real waste of time.",
39,4 August 2021,Turfseer,6, Epic tale of revisionist history loses steam in second half,"T. E. Lawrence, the British Army lieutenant who in the popular imagination was primarily responsible for defeating the Ottoman Empire during World War I, was the perfect anti-hero for the revisionist 1960s. Iconic film director David Lean already had displayed his ""anti-colonial"" credentials in his 1957 portrait of an intransigent British army officer in The Bridge Over the River Kwai. But by 1962 when Lawrence of Arabia was released, he would go further in pouring gasoline on the fire to ensure that Britain's image as a noble colonial ruler was tarnished almost beyond recognition.",
40,15 October 2011,wandereramor,7, The grand-daddy of all biopics,"If we're in the mood to do film genealogies, and I am, then Lawrence of Arabia is probably the inventor of the modern biopic, the perennial awards-bait genre. (You could maybe posit Citizen Kane as the originator, but that's really a different kettle of fish.) It examines a fairly recent historical figure at the prime of their life, dedicating numerous scenes and most of the dialogue to hammering home that the central character is a Very Special Person Unlike His Short-Sighted Bosses, and in this way the film spends a good amount of time justifying itself. This genre obviously has strengths and flaws, and they're apparent in Lawrence: the striking personal power as well as the kind of historical oversimplification and tourism that goes along with it.",

Directed by David Lean and scripted by Robert Bolt, it has the participation of Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif.",
42,5 February 2023,brianberta,9, A thematically complex film.,"This is the kind of film where there's not much I can say about its greatness that hasn't already been said, but since I read about some controversy about the apparent white savior elements of the film, I figured I'd respond to them. First things first, I don't have an issue with the white savior trope as long as the people the white person is helping aren't depicted as dumb or incompetent, and I'd say this film accomplishes that just fine. However, to dismiss Lawrence as a white savior is an inaccurate reading of his character. Instead of being portrayed as a hero, Lawrence is instead shown to be naïve for thinking he can save the Arabic people from the Turkish army and from British colonization. The film also makes a point to nullify many of Lawrence's significant accomplishments. For instance, acting as a father figure for Daud and Farraj is countered by how they both die in his company, his rescue of Gasim is countered when he's forced to execute him shortly afterwards, his decision to blow up the Ottoman railways is countered by how he's forced to execute one of his only remaining friends, his ambush of a group of retreating Turkish soldiers is countered by how he leads to the massacre of numerous surrendering soldiers and later regrets it, and his victory in capturing Damascus is countered by how they lose the city to British rule. Most importantly though, all his accomplishments in the film are countered by how they help pave way for British colonization. Given all that, it's clear Lawrence is actually presented as a modern Icarus rather than a hero. Calling this a white savior film because of Lawrence's success against the Turkish army misses the entire point. With that being said, ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is still my favorite David Lean film, mainly because the character dynamics and the final act in that film resonated with me more. If there's one area this film outshines the other one in though, it's the cinematography. In addition to having some terrific shots, like the iconic match scene and Ali's introduction, the numerous landscape views of the desert look incredible. Seemingly stretching out for miles and miles, they're at once beautiful and foreboding to look at. Overall, while I don't think this film will ever rise to favorite status, it's still great and I'm glad I was finally able to rewatch it.",
43,30 November 2010,mjneu59,10, can only be appreciated on a really big screen,"David Lean's stunning 1962 portrait of the fabled World War One adventurer is sometimes hard to pin down, and perhaps for good reason. Filming Robert Bolt's thoughtful script against the spectacular wide-screen panoramas of ace cinematographer Freddie Young, with Maurice Jarre's justifiably famous music score for support, makes it all too easy to overlook some of the finer nuances of such a complex character. Lawrence went into the desert not only to enlist Arab aid against the Turks, but also (in modern jargon) in a quest of self-discovery. In the end he found more than he bargained for, after being transfigured by the unforgiving landscape into something more than just an ordinary man, but something less than the near-deity all but worshipped by his Arab hosts. The length of the film (overture included) is intimidating, but seeing it again on the big screen shames the petty ambitions of today's ersatz blockbusters, proving in truly epic proportions that intelligent entertainment is not an oxymoron.",

45,12 June 2018,daoldiges,10, Grand and Intimate Epic,"For some unknown reason I've always had an attraction to this film and it's enigmatic lead character. Which is why I went all through my high school and college years refusing to see it on the small screen in the hopes that I would someday have the chance to see it on the big screen. I was about to give up when in 1987 they released the 25th anniversary edition. Boy, am I glad I waited. I was not disappointed and this film was even more than I'd imagined it to be, which is super tough considering I'd been building it up in my mind for almost 15 years. The story, score, costumes, performances and most significantly Lean's deft and inspired direction all held me captivated from beginning to end. I'd read several biographies of T.E. Lawrence, and was this film a wholly accurate depiction of him and the events during the Arab campaign, not exactly. Then again it's a dramatic film inspired by Lawrence and not a documentary, which is why I take issue with those who complain that the film is not a detail by detail account and I remind myself that for every film inspired by either a real person or book that there will always be those hold-outs who refuse to allow themselves to fully enjoy art for arts sake. Oh well, their loss. As for me and anyone else reading this review I cannot recommend this film enough, and if possible see it on the big screen to fully appreciate it. I am an admirer of Lean's work but do want to add that I actually appreciate the full theatrical release quite a bit more than the special director's cut release.",

These fore-mentioned directors based their films off the style of this film. No one knew it in 1962, but this film would be one of the most influential films of all time. Believe it or not, I actually didn't think too much of the film the first time I saw it. I thought it was overlong and boring. I must have been in a bad mood that day, because I simply loved the film upon my second viewing. The scope of the film is incredible and I love the lush, gorgeous cinematography. The film is sweepingly beautiful and I still love seeing the shots of the desert sun. Everything in the film has a gentle beauty to it, even the violent battles featured in the film, so it's no surprise the film won an Oscar for its cinematography.",

Over the past few years I've found more joy in short films than the longer ones; hence, why I loved the Canadian show ZeD since it featured lots of short films. I also watch some TV shows where episodes are only 20-22 minutes long. I enjoyed The Dark Knight (2008) but thought it was a bit too long- two hours and twenty minutes. Then there's Lawrence of Arabia (1962)- almost four hours long! Yet the movie is good enough that I actually don't resent it for its length. I don't think I'd cut anything from it. I'm not sure if I've seen it in one sitting, but it's actually compelling viewing.",

Lawrence was a most impressive guy who was sent to colonize the Middle East and in the process began to identify with the people there. In the title role here, Peter O'Toole certainly does a really good job. The question is how accurate the movie is. Specifically, I mean the scene where Lawrence attacks the train and the Arabs cheer him on; I get the feeling that it didn't really happen like that, given that Lawrence was sent as a colonizer.

Being that the movie was made 45 years ago, I wasn't going into it thinking I would agree with either statement necessarily. Whether the four hour run time was too daunting to get my hopes up or not, I knew that no matter what, I needed to finally see this film.

51,22 August 2006,georgioskarpouzas,8, unconventional imperialists,"This movie has been the most praised movie by David Lean and is a favorite of Greek television which plays it every year especially during religious holidays. It is a memorable film and has many affinities with A passage to India in the sense that it presents the picture of an unconventional Briton who defying his prejudiced superiors sides with the native underdogs,underdogs from the point of view of the British of course, for, for their own people they are the elite. But differences exist: while Fielding in a passage to India makes a temporary alliance with a falsely accused Indian middle-class doctor, Lawrence forms meaningfull relationships with simple Arabs as the camel boys and the Arab whom he saves with danger of his life. Of course the main course of action is the relationship of the British agents with the indigenous ruling class. The movie is based on the life of a historical personnage T.E. Lawrence, a British archaeologist,spy, adventurer and larger than life personality.The historical veracity of the movie is questionable since as Steven Spielberg said in an interview, this movie genre is not a documentary but creative use of existent historical material- creative logistics comes to mind. Of course art always has to uplift the mundane realities of life, in that case of colonial power politics. As far as we know Lawrence was not the ardent arabophile the movie presents him to be and he was loyal to his country's imperial interests which did not identify with those of the Arabs, that is of the dynasty of Prince Feisal since no institutions as referendums were utilized to express the will of the average Arab, if such a life-form existed then. While the politics of the film is unreliable and murky, its' artistry is great with unforgettable performances of the major and minor protagonists of this drama that was the Arab Revolt.Lawrence, general Allenby, Prince Feisal, the hauitat chief Abu-tayi, the American journalist are all portrayed unforgettably, although I suspect that if one was to meet those personalities in private after having seen the movie(which of course is impossible) he would be disappointed. But of course the role of art is to create role models and icons not to copy mundane reality.",

The film clocks in at just under 4-hours and relies wholly on the concept of developing Peter O'Toole's titular character. Joining O'Toole are notable actors Alec Guinness and Omar Sharif to tell the story of T.E. Lawrence, the English officer who sought to go into the desert to unify the divided Arab tribes to fight the Turks in WWI. Lawrence took the burden of unification onto his shoulders voluntarily, believing he could be a great force for unity; Lean's portrayal of Lawrence's story is nothing short of an artful masterpiece.",
59,30 June 2019,nferlisi,8, A Film of Epic Scale and Epic Proportion= One of the Greatest,"Every once in a while there is a film that will blow you away from start to finish, in this case Lawrence of Arabia ins one of those very few films that will blow you away. For many years my grandfather enjoyed this film and suggested it to me for some time, finally being old enough to see it, I see why he and many others have enjoyed it. Epics are a kind of film that take an immense approach towards a story that needs a massive vision in order to tell such a story. David Lean took this massive vision in order to create something of epic scale and scope, which captured the extensiveness of an epic-genre film. Like most other epics, they take a great amount of time to tell their long stories, some ranging between three to five hours long which I will say may be too long for any kind of film. Lawrence of Arabia runs in at three hours and thirty-six minutes would seem like a rather long film, but this runtime feels appropriate when telling the progressional story of T.E. Lawrence building his character in great depth. Think of it like breaking the character of T.E. Lawrence into several parts such as a man, soldier, hero, leader, and advisor. In regards to the performances, Peter O'Toole brings T.E. Lawrence to life on multiple levels making us feel for his life journey and all other circumstances that he faces on that journey. All supporting and secondary performances adds a lot of good flare as well, especially from Omar Sharif's character. The direction by David Lean resonates every minute of this epic, Lean took such great care in creating a film of scale, meaning making this film both look and feel immense. Great utilization of wide lenses and shots allow the look of the film to larger than life, which in turn makes those particular shots more impactful.",

This movie portrays a moment in history when the Arab people and the West were actually ALLIES, fighting together against a common enemy. Here a British soldier, Lawrence, actually risks his life in the cause for Arab independence. This is am incredible revelation. Peter O'Toole play Lawrence. Although O'Toole is at least a foot taller than the actual T. E. Lawrence, he nevertheless gives an outstanding performance as the enigmatic and heroic figure. Of course, one should not confuse this movie with a documentary, so don't cite this movie if you're doing a paper on the subject.

Lawrence treks across a massive desert in the midst of a war between the Arabs and the Turks. He meets with Prince Faisal who leads this revolt against the Turks. The film depicts how these events at first come as a humorous challenge, to gaining respect for saving a life of someone who falls behind, to performing an execution, to being flogged. Director David Lean previously scored success with The Bridge on the River Kwai and now he creates another broad scale film of desert landscapes and riveting war violence where Lawrence leads in the blowing up railroads. Peter O'Toole delivers a masterful performance as Lawrence who experiences the exhilaration of violence to the extremes of human decay. Alec Guinness plays Faisal who looks on at Lawrence with curiosity. Omar Sharif steals scenes as Sheriff Ali who first shoots Lawrence's companion for unauthorized drinking from an Arab well, then they become close companions. Anthony Quinn is also featured as a tribal leader persuaded to join in the revolt. Jack Hawkins is cast as General Allenby. This is a powerful film about the exploits of violence and its wages upon the human soul. Score: 10 / 10",

Also, while I'm skeptical about today's PC-brainwashed stories, the different factions were presented in a very one-dimensional way, the running time would have allowed for more nuanced characters.

Ignoring the skepticism of the already-present British officer, Colonel Brighton (Anthony Quayle), he convinces Feisal and the latter's chief lieutenant, the fiery Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif), to allow him a small expedition to seize the Turkish-held seaport of Aqaba, Jordan.

This catches the attention of the British general staff in Cairo - including General Edmund Allenby (Jack Hawkins), who has replaced Murray - who decide to supply Lawrence with arms and supplies to wage a guerrilla war against Turkey to complement Allenby's conventional attacks - but with a tight leash, as Britain (and France) have designs on the Middle East. Encouraged by his victories and an American journalist (Arthur Kennedy) who is looking for a hero, Lawrence lets his fame get to his head, thus beginning a long downward spiral as he discovers his own fallibility, the perfidy of his commanders, and that, no matter where he is, he must always be an outsider.",

Firstly in not having the courage to hold Omar Sharif's entrance for longer and secondly in not making it clearer that Lawrence was not only beaten but also buggered by the Turks. The film suggests that Lawrence did not know about the Sykes-Picot Treaty but only 'suspected'. He almost certainly did know hence his burden of guilt at having betrayed the Arabs. These are minor quibbles of course and do not detract from the films magnificence. It would be nigh on impossible of course to assemble a cast of this quality now. When Lean and cinematographer Freddie Young met on the set, Young said 'Don't teach your grandmother to suck eggs'. Lean very wisely took his advice. At the films premiere the Duke of Edinburgh enquired of Lean:'good flick is it?' Lean's response? 'I hope so, sir'.

Not only because of the great controversy surrounding his figure, but also because of the extremely difficult faithful representation of the events that occurred in Arabia between 1916 and 1918. The task of scripting the deeds of this very pertinent historical figure was the responsibility of Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson. Basing the entire narrative on the events described by T. E. Lawrence in his memoirs and notes, we have the creation of one of the most epic stories ever brought to the seventh art, despite its relatively simple approach. The merit of the simplicity of the story of Lawrence of Arabia lies in the point of interest that Lean and the scriptwriters wanted to focus on: the historical figure and nothing else, leaving aside any importance regarding the historical context of the War nor the disjointed situation of Arabia, which was not a Unified state, even more under strict control of the Ottoman Empire.",

I finally got a copy and saw it. It is is a wonderful story of one the most interesting figures in history. It is intelligent and exciting and frustrating. I began by accepting the verisimilitude of this film. I then watched the incredible effort put forth by Lawrence as he barged his British rear end into the affairs of the Arabs to meet and defeat the Turks. For me, the politics were the most interesting. The British Empire with its pack of windbags, bringing the world to its knees. We speak of the Nazis. What about the way the British treated the Bedouin populations in the name of imperialism. Still, as a snapshot of the strange landscape of social expansion, this movie is wonderful I found Lawrence's character utterly insufferable at times, his arrogance and insensitivity; but, by the same token, he was great to watch. I wish I'd had a chance to see this on the big screen. One issue I would take is that there is an awful lot of time following camels running across the desert.

Sprawling, of course, but also imposing epic drama from director David Lean, with a nearly four-hour length that can be self-defeating. It's a film that should be seen on the big screen to get the full effect, although Lean's staggering grandeur tends to dwarf the plot, which is hardly a study of T.E. Lawrence and more a commercially-viable action picture. The performances are solid and intense, and there are many memorable sequences, but it's far more exhausting than moving. Visually it's always exciting, but we don't sense the broiling hot sun, or the winds whispering over the dunes. It's too much a tableaux.

117,16 January 2007,eyecandyforu,10, Haunting,"Hard to believe that after 45 years of loving movies, I finally got around to seeing Lawrence of Arabia. As with many films that make a huge impact on me, I dreamt about it that night. I dreamt of flowing white silk robes, decorated horses and sand. Lots of sand. Many have already given a synopsis and cast list, many have listed the films assets. For me, after the experience (and trust me, at 227 minutes, it's an experience) I was left feeling stunned and empty, stunned by the depiction of the desert, empty from the realization that nothing within the dark expanses of human experience really changes. Yes to one reviewer who was not sure Lawrence ever existed. He did. A very complicated man, shy yet full of an odd bravado, Lawrence reveled in the drama of a land he loved but could not be part of. He sought adventure and when it came, was overwhelmed and ultimately disappointed that his life was not like the childhood adventure tales he undoubtedly read. The film tells his story in broad strokes, very strong characters surround Lawrence, whose character is played brilliantly by O'Toole who stays quietly charismatic (as well as physically beautiful) creating an enigma that is never really understood. You're left wondering how the hell he got away with what he did, yet amazed that it happened. The futility of war is tempered with the romanticism it creates. People come together in common causes, strong relationships develop, heroes emerge. Wars are full of such scenarios and inspirational tales. But this is at heart the story of a film flam game, a bait and switch played on a grand scale with an Empirical Western giant manipulating desperate peoples using one of their flamboyant yet influential soldiers as a ploy. This con game was the undoing of T. E. Lawrence and he spent the rest of his life in guilt, trying to escape his fame, changing his name, reluctant to accept profits from his memoirs and wondering if the adventure had been worth it.",
118,15 August 2006,jboothmillard,10, Lawrence of Arabia,"From Oscar and Golden Globe winning director Sir David Lean (Brief Encounter, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Doctor Zhivago), this is a magnificent classic that really set the standard for large on location filmed pictures. Basically it it is the true story of the finest British heroes who made his name in the First World War, Thomas Edward Lawrence (introducing BAFTA winning, and Oscar and twice Golden Globe nominated Peter O'Toole). The film starts with T.E. being killed in a motorbike accident, before going into flashback where he, a misfit British Army lieutenant, was stationed to Cairo, in the deserts of Arabia with orders from Mr. Dryden (Claude Rains) and objections from General Murray (Donald Wolfit). He is sent to assess Prince Faisal (Sir Alec Guinness) and the plans to revolt against the Turks, after his Bedouin guide is killed by Sheriff Ali (twice Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Omar Sharif), he takes him to Colonel Brighton (Anthony Quayle) who introduces him to the Prince. Lawrence proposes with the Prince to make a surprise attack on Aqaba, which is only strongly fortified from one direction, and it is filled with many much needed supplies, and it is agreed that fifty men, plus teenage orphan servants Daud (John Dimech) and Farraj (Michel Ray), join him. Against odds they make it through the Nefud Desert, but Lawrence risking his own life goes back alone for fallen man Gasim (I.S. Johar), and returning to earn respect from originally sceptical Sheriff Ali. He also recruits powerful local Howeitat tribe leader Auda Abu Tayi (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Anthony Quinn) to go against the Turks, there is however a blood feud where a murderer needs to be found, who turns out to be Gasim, and his saviour shoots him, admitting later pleasure. Next we see Lawrence informing Dryden and the new commanding general General Lord Edmund Allenby (Jack Hawkins) in Cairo that they had victory overrunning the Turks, and we saw Daud die sinking into quicksand, and he is promoted to major. Next a guerrilla war is launched where trains are blown up and Turks are harassed, and he is made world famous when his exploits are published by American war correspondent Jackson Bentley (Arthur Kennedy). After shooting Farraj (Michel Ray) who is badly injured before he can be tortured after another raid Lawrence is taken with some Arabs by some Turks, before going to Jerusalem, and he is a changed tormented man. After returning he recruits an army full of money hungry killers and cutthroats rather than the Arab cause, and there is a point when he relishes in the results of a massacre. After taking Damascus, and some political debates and stuff, the end sees Lawrence promoted to colonel and immediately ordered home thought useful for both Faisal and the British diplomats, and he is driven away feeling dispirited. It may have been over three hours and twenty minutes long, but it is worth it, all the performances, especially from O'Toole, Sharif, Guinness and Quinn are fantastic, the story is admirable and enigmatic, the use of colour is impressive, but of course the real star is the magnificent grand scale landscapes, the golden sandy deserts with occasional mirages and blurry heat waves accompanied by the wonderful music by Maurice Jarre are essential viewing, one of the greatest British films ever made, a brilliant epic historical adventure. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Maurice Jarre, Best Sound and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it won the BAFTAs for Best British Film, Best British Screenplay and Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Cinematography.

130,12 December 2006,tsf-1962,10, slow but absorbing,"It is difficult to watch this movie today without thinking about the current situation in Iraq. Europeans--and now Americans--have been intervening in the Middle East, with disastrous results, since the Trojan War; ""Lawrence of Arabia"" tells the story of a man who played a key role in a critical period that led to much of the current turmoil in the region. In order to defeat the Turks, who were allied to the Germans, Great Britain unleashed the genie of Arab nationalism, and no one has been able to bottle it since. By promising what was then Palestine to both Jews and Arabs Britain unwittingly planted the seeds of the interminable Arab-Israeli conflict--but that's outside the scope of this review. Peter O'Toole plays T.E. Lawrence as a bipolar, sexually ambiguous nerd with a messiah complex (interestingly there are no women in the movie). In leading the Arabs to victory over the Turks Lawrence sees himself as their liberator when in fact he's the tool of western imperialism. The latter part of the movie, which depicts Lawrence's bumbling attempts to introduce western-style democracy to the Arabs, bears striking resemblance to George W. Bush's equally naive meddling in Iraq. As spectacle, the movie has never been surpassed and scarcely equalled; among big-budget epics of similar scope only ""Ben Hur,"" ""The Ten Commandments,"" and possibly ""Apocalypse Now"" come close; the only movie with similar grandeur is ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" and of course that's a different kind of epic. Sir David Lean won a well-deserved Best Director Oscar for this film. The movie made stars out of O'Toole and Omar Sharif, but there are Oscar-worthy performances from Sir Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins, Arthur Kennedy and Claude Rains; Jose Ferrer is uncommonly creepy as a sadistic Turkish officer, in a scene with uncomfortable homoerotic overtones.

More than once I wound up saying to myself 'I get it already' after repeated close ups of the baking desert sun and the limitless expanse of sand. Nor was I inspired to empathize with Lawrence's cause to unite the Bedouin tribes. One might contend that the story is far enough removed from modern history both chronologically and geographically to be of interest, but I would point to two films of the 1930's that took a similar tack and worked for me a whole lot better - 1935's ""The Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" and 1939's ""Gunga Din"", both taking place on the Indian sub continent.",

134,3 August 2006,writerasfilmcritic,10, An Excellent Effort on Many Levels,"I won't try to compete with the superlatives of others and am less certain that this movie was the best flick of the 1960s. In that decade, American ""culture"" enjoyed a true renaissance, and our films were as much a reflection of it as was our music, our literature, and our science. As many good movies were made in a single year back then as have been made ever since, which is perhaps why Peter O'Toole didn't win the Academy Award for Best Actor --he had too much competition (Gregory Peck won it for ""To Kill a Mockingbird""). Obviously, however, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" was one of the best movies of its time and one of the best movies ever made. To me, the real star of the movie was the Arabian Desert (although technically, it was filmed in Morrocco and Jordan). There was dramatic and arresting physical beauty in its sense of limitless space and its bleak, wind-whipped desolation. The dunes with their swirling sands, the dramatic barren mountains, and the isolated ridges far off in the distance yet easily visible all contributed to a dreamlike world. Perhaps even more important, and certainly more relevant to the theme, was the spiritual element inseparable from the vast emptiness of the broiling desert wilderness. The gorgeous and highly effective landscape photography firmly established the setting early in the film. Not unexpectedly, it was Lawrence's determination to leave the desert that signaled his eventual demise. His return ""home"" to England and the shallow, conventional life it offered led to the motorcycle accident that ultimately killed him. It seems he had ceased to follow his heart, perhaps because his experiences in Arabia, which had inspired him to greatness, had at the same time transformed him into someone he no longer believed in, understood, or felt he could keep living up to. By war's end, therefore, he seemed to have outlived his usefulness, if not so much to his Arab friends (who apparently worshiped him), than in his own mind. ",
135,14 October 2008,thinker1691,9," "" Nothing Changed at Dara, . . He was The Same Man! ""","The true story of T.E.Lawrence is hidden somewhere inside his personal memoirs. For the adventure-seeking Englishman from Oxfordshire, the Middle East was a land so remote from his that surely a man could become a hero, if he found the right location or conflict. Lawrence himself was a self taught expert in many of his interests. Having graduated from prestigious places, made him even more sought after by authorities, both academic and military. The film "" Lawrence of Arabia "" is laced with many actual events taken from Lawrence's own accounts, and it's difficult to separate fact from fiction. That is not really important for the Hollywood version in which Peter O'Toole plays T.E. Lawrence with such uncanny precision, the character overlaps the actual man. To add to the authenticity are the supporting actors such as Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal who is superb in his part. Anthony Quinn is Auda abu Tayi and is so convincing, many actual Arabs on the set accepted him as one. The main actor who gain hundreds of accolades while filming is Omar Sharif who plays Sheriff Ali. Jack Hawkins plays, General Edmund Allenby and Anthony Quayle is Colonel Brighten. The Turkish General is played by none other than Jose Ferrer. Claude Rains is the sly and slippery French minister Mr. Dryden. Arthur Kennedy is the American Newspaperman Jackson Bentley, seeking a story for his readers. When one views the film, it cannot but overwhelm as the vast but beautiful desert scenery and dramatic events convince the audience this film is fantastic in breath and scope.

I have to be in a proper mood and have to be willing to get on a journey or an adventure, if you will, to another place and time. Happily, the conditions were right for me to watch an epic and I did watch Lawrence. A lot of things were intriguing about that film: The amazing cinematography, the framing of shots, the impeccable crowd control, and, you know, all the technical stuff. Although not as good as Lawrence's, these qualities are present in other epics as well. What really drew me into the film was T.E Lawrence's character in the film. Usually in epics, the characters take a back seat for the sake of the action or events. But here we see this intimate personal story of a man who, for some reason, challenges and tests himself: Burning his hand with the matchstick, standing in front of a man firing bullets towards him and almost killing him, and constantly going to dangerous battles with the Arabs. For what? He's not doing it for his country and most probably not for the Arabs. He is trying to prove something to himself about himself. He is a deeply self-destructive character and to have such small exquisite story of a man within the epic canvas of the wars and the desert is just extraordinary. I can't believe that Sam Spiegel really took a chance on this madly genius (and very risky) film.

I have seen this film in 70 mm (which I high recommend doing), and I recently watched the 4k UHD, which gave me an even greater appreciation for how outstanding the cinematography is. The desert landscape provides an epic feel that's unsurpassed, aided by Maurice Jarre's magnificent score. David Lean's masterful direction guides us through it all, anchored by one of the greatest ever film performances by Peter O'Toole as the enigmatic, charismatic, yet troubled Lawrence. Highly recommended.",

Spiegel's greatest triumph would come with this film in a new decade the 1960's. Columbia Pictures gave Spiegel's great discretion as he worked from London under his Horizon Film's banner. Stars like Brando, Hepburn, Bogart, Taylor, Clift, were in Speigel's films. Taking the story of T E Lawrence, Sam Spiegel once again joined forces with His great collaborator on The Bridge on River Kawi David Lean and together they made in my assessment the finest film of all time ""Lawrence Of Arabia"".",

147,2 April 2001,telegonus,7, A Dissenting View On Lawrence Of Arabia,"This is a film generally hailed as great that I believe is merely good, and at times mediocre. Yes, Fred Young's photography is magnificent, Robert Bolt's script far more intelligent and clever than the average screenplay, and David Lean most definitely had an flair for spectacle. All this is true. Many of the actors are good, too. But it goes on too long and doesn't explain enough of Lawrence's personality. Mostly, though, what ruins the film for me is its pretentiousness. Lean is simply trying too hard: for beautiful effects, stunning shots of the desert, sweeping moments, ironic ones, lovely shots of pretty things and ugly shots of evil things, all captured to perfection by his beloved camera. The movie is funny and disturbing and true to life, at other times larger than life, it is a history lesson and an action picture, a thinking man's spectacle...but it's shoveled down my throat and I resent it, and half-way through I want to spit it out. Art is to a large extent made up of artifice, however, artificiality should not be the main thing but rather one of the many things one likes about a work of art. Lawrence, it seems to me, is pure artifice, and not much else. Let me give an example. There is a scene near the end of the film when the various competing factions among the Arabs are debating over what to do in the post-war world. Suddenly, the lights dim in the great hall where they're all gathered. At first I thought nothing of it, a nice touch, maybe even true. Then, as I pondered the matter, I got angry with the scene and the film for the obvious symbolism: the lights are England, the hall is the Middle East, the sun is setting on the British empire, on the West in general, and the Third World shall triumph despite its lack of much technical know-how (the lights). Instant term paper! Moments like these, and Lawrence is full of them, turned me off,--how shall I say--big time? To make matters worse, Peter O'Toole's prancing-mincing-detached-ironic-aristocratic posturing wore me down early on, as I found him increasingly repulsive as the film dragged on. Nothing in Lawrence is natural and alive. It all seems so thought out. I agree that a tremendous amount of talent went into the making of this overrated so-called classic, but the result is just a lot of, well, hot air. (Sorry I didn't go into the story itself here, since I am assuming, probably incorrectly, that most people are at least casually familiar with the life and times of T.E. Lawrence).",
148,28 March 2019,amplicqu,9, Deftly handled economies of scale by Lean,"Lean handles the desert as co-star with O'Toole as Ford did Monument Valley with his Western epics and Wayne. But Lean does it better.
Lawrence goes in an idealistic innocent, a brilliant but naive man who believes he can unite long conflicted tribal societies into a single, powerful group that could work themselves out of the colonial reign of Britain.
He discovers corruption and murder in other men, as well as in himself. By the time an Arab conference fails to unite the tribes, Lawrence is a shattered man. He has personally lost close friends, learned to love killing, been debased. He'd hoped to open doors for a people and place he learned to love, but manages to ruin himself.
O Toole, Sharif, even Quinn at his hammiest before Zorba, do amazing work, with pristine supporting roles by Claude Rains and Alec Guinness.

Also, director David Lean and crew picked up more all-time top tens for this film than any other. So you might ask why it gets less sustained adulation than other top tens? As General Murray says in the film itself, the war in Arabia was ""a sideshow of a sideshow"", even at the time. Also, it has no parts for women, unless you count three seconds dragging off the mens' leftover food, and four seconds of ululating from a distant hillside. I suppose I can understand why female movie buffs are less enthralled by this all-guy war adventure than I am. Nevertheless, this all male cast put on a 'sideshow' which outshines all but (perhaps) a precious few films in all of cinematic history.

The background music scored by Maurice Jarre added to the gravitas of making it one of the greatest films. The soundtracks are full of energy and kept resonating in my mind right from the time the movie commenced. Peter O'Toole portrayed T.E.Lawrence, a man often marred by controversy for his radical thinking and insouciance. T.E.Lawrence is shown as a man respected by his fellowmen after his contribution to the Arab league in the beginning of the movie and the movie shows his journey from Cairo to Aqaba and then to Damascus as a member of the British army. He's considered arrogant, extraordinary and sadistic by his colleagues but that doesn't stymie the aid, leadership in attacking the Turks and the invaluable counsel he provided the Arabs . The movie is a landmark in every single aspect right from the geographical location of filming.

This movie has gorgeous vistas of the desert and impressive battle sequences, but it also presents characters that are so badly characterized that it works against it. No character is likeable; they are all shortsighted, narrow-minded, vexatious individuals. That is basically the only real issue of the movie.

162,27 December 2011,addiewhiz,10, Simply the Best!,"I have had the privilege of watching some of the greatest films ever made. However, of all of those films, none have been quite able to match the simply magnificent splendor of ""Lawrence of Arabia"". I strongly believe that this is the greatest film ever made. I'll begin with the dialog. Every conversation and line of dialog in this film is so precisely crafted and so memorable. The film begins by showing how the title character, Thomas Edward Lawrence dies. At his funeral, a reporter is walking around talking to various characters that will later be shown to be of significance in the story. Two of these characters are British Generals Murray and Allenby. Both of them claim to have not known him well. This scene perfectly sets the stage for the story. A story about a man who was mysterious, strange and seldom understood by those around him, particularly his peers in the British Army. The director, Sir David Lean, also does an excellent job in casting each and every one of the characters, especially the main character, T.E. Lawrence himself. Peter O'Toole's portrayal of Lawrence is absolutely spectacular, as he is able to make it such that Lawrence's behavior and actions are uniquely in tune with his circumstances, while still transcending all of it. If I were to go into how amazing the casting of the other characters is as well, this review would go well beyond the IMDb word limit. One of the most striking elements of this film is the cinematography. Not many films are this successful at immersing the audience into the environment of the story. The spectacular views of the desert in this film make the viewer feel as though they are going through this adventure with Lawrence, and make the entire experience feel so much more real. I could go on, but I feel that a review about this films many strengths would take far too long.",

I've seen the film a few times over the years but recently watched the watched the 2012 restoration. Regardless of your opinion of the historical veracity of his portrayal, Peter O'Toole is magnificent as the highly-educated, erudite British officer who 'went native' only to be deceived by his own countrymen. The casting of Sir Alec Guinness and Anthony Quinn as Arabs may raise hackles in these sensitive times but both are excellent, as is the entire cast, especially Omar Sharif (in his first English speaking role) as Sharif Ali, whose first appearance as a distant rider in a vast expanse of desert, is iconic. The cinematography is breathtaking, especially the dramatic views of the unforgiving desert or enormous set pieces such as the attack on Aquaba.

I watched this film because a friend recommended it to me. i sat down, ready and willing to watch it because of all the praise it had received. About an hour later, i was about to fall asleep. nothing was happening at all. i do enjoy many long films (Dances With Wolves, Titanic, etc.), but the fact that this film lasts about three hours and forty minutes is asinine. Why does this film about a guy that hardly anyone has heard about have to be this long/ I know why! Because all that was on the film makers minds was "" I wonder how many Oscars I can get with this film."" The Academy loves epic, and this sure was an epic. A seriously flawed epic. First of all is the length. All of this material could have been shown in a matter of 2 and a half hours, if only the script writer had cut out unnecessary dialogue. second, is how Peter O' Toole portrayed Lawrence. Apparently this character is a man who gets a rush by killing people. but, instead of giving the viewers a portrait of why this character has this issue, it instead shows shots of as much desert land as possible. Third of all, this film did not make me leave with a sort of meaning or purpose. All I left with was questions that could have been answered if only It had a better script. now, there are some aspects of the film that saved it from being a one star.

175,13 December 2007,funkyfry,10, Awesome film,"David Lean created a film that has already stood the so-called test of time  in fact moreso, it has itself become the test and the measure against which all other war melodrama is compared. It has more to tell us about the struggle between the West and the Middle-East than any contemporary film I've seen. Here we have a strong contrast between the cynical career soldiers and diplomats (most memorably, Claude Rains in one of his last good roles) and an idealistic young man Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) who wants to ""help"" the Arab people establish their own state. But even with all his hope and his good intentions, Lawrence ends up destroying himself and perhaps leaving the Middle-East in a worse position than he found it. Lessons are to be learned from this film that still haven't been learned by all that many, despite its status as a revered ""classic."" There's simply too many strong elements in this film to talk about within the space allowed here  there are so many ideas floating around and so much beauty to behold on screen that every time I see it, it's like I'm seeing a slightly different movie that speaks to me about different things and inspires wonder in me that I've never felt before. With that in mind I advise anyone who hasn't seen it to stop reading, and also to try to see it in a theater if possible. Just to overview. Maurice Jarre's score is perfect; the instant you hear it you will always remember the images and characters of this movie. Freddie Young's photography has never been surpassed in terms of desert cinematography, and Lean manages not only to elicit deft performances from these actors but also to somehow keep the visual momentum flowing so that we're impressed with the monotonous nature and the isolation of the desert and yet never allowing the film's look to become totally static. For example when we see Lawrence sitting on the hill trying to decide if he should go South with Feisal (Alec Guinness) or lead some men West with Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif) we get a kind of night-time blueish color and a kind of slow breeze moving the sand in ripples that makes the scene totally unlike anything in the rest of the film. When Lawrence, Sheriff and Auda abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn) reach Acuba, there's a stunning shot that pans all the way from the desert through the city and to the ocean, at the same time breathtaking its scope and beauty and strangely depressing and isolating because it communicates the idea that the ocean is just a desert made of water, and we humans are the unfortunate ones who must make a living in the tiny spaces between.",

I was amazed by the size of the theater let alone the opening scene of this movie with the desert sunrise. There were huge speakers in the back of the theater which enhanced the music perfectly. Peter O'Toole was the perfect choice to play the main character T.E. Lawrence. Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Claude Rains, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quinn and Jose Ferrer were perfectly cast for their parts throughout the movie as well as other movies that they would play in. World War I was a horrible war with so many new ways to kill each other readily available. The battle scene in the second half of the movie brings out some of those horrors. Lawrence was a visionary at the right place at the right time in history even though as time passed his vision was more skewed until he finally left Arabia. Jack Hawkins and Claude Rains played their parts perfectly as the General and diplomat who would use whomever they could to get what they wanted in the end.

Aside from the unbelievable cast, haunting score, and superb acting (particularly O'Toole's Lawrence... even better in the director's cut which shows additional facets of O'Toole's character development), the film demonstrates the most effective tactics employed in asymmetrical warfare... hit and run strikes on soft targets like Aqaba and Turkish railroad/supply lines. These are the tactics currently being utilized in Iraq, and we could learn valuable lessons, namely that the Sykes-Picot agreement and its arbitrary national boundaries, combined with the dishonesty of the British has been a great factor in the ever-present unrest that has plagued the region since the days of Lawrence. Perhaps we would also be wise to note that a superpower has NEVER defeated a well-established insurgency. Even ignoring its intellectual provocation, this is an epic that effectively balances the sweeping vastness of the Arabian peninsula's awe inspiring deserts with the (certainly exaggerated) grandeur of the fascinating character that was T.E. Lawrence.",
204,27 May 2014,Marc_Israel_365,7," ""Florence of Arabia""","My reaction after seeing this desert epic is one of conflicted perception. We have a grandiose visual story that is written for a man who leads men into the untried and untrue. Most cast were standouts and need no further immortalizing here. I enjoyed their clear approach to their characters. But while T.E. Lawrence was certainly not Moses, as was adeptly noted by his detractors, the role certainly was one of a leader, a defiant one, but still one whom men would follow into battle. How it was cast with Peter O'Toole, and effeminate English boy trying to be noble beyond country affiliation, seems to be a contradiction of that absolute requirement. I wouldn't follow him into a bar, no less the dessert. Who does he serve? Petulance, adventure, intuition and self-righteousness. A well-spoken scholar with ideas outside of the box makes for a great strategist, not a war general. Politics are also in the same realm of books read by Lawrence, yet he was so overcome with himself that the subject of oil could not be breached? Who could be so naive to think the English would leave Arabia to the Arabs once they had it in their hands. I watched the film as a boyish fantasy, and enjoyed it as the mis-cast adventures of T.E.

Though I didn't realize it until I saw him wearing them, I've seen Lawrence's Arabian clothes many times, several of these before I knew of the movie at all. I think that's what defines a true classic; that you know of it... before you're told. That it's ""everywhere"", in a sense. You can't really go anywhere without hearing about it at some point, because it was such an experience, it had such an impact on people. Everything that came later was in some way influenced by it, affected by it. The first thing that struck me about this film is how beautifully shot it is; at first, I couldn't quite muster up the effort to pay full attention, thinking about how long it would be(ADD victim = yours truly), but when I finally did, I couldn't take my eyes off it again. It was mesmerizing, captivating. I couldn't possibly express through mere words how amazing the visuals are... you have to see for yourself. Some say that the film is 'flashy', but every masterpiece has its critics. I'm certainly not one of this masterpiece's. The plot is well-written and develops nicely throughout the film. The pacing is very good, I was hardly bored at any point watching it(though it is quite a behemoth of a viewing experience... three hours and twenty minutes). The acting is top-notch, and Guinness, Sharif, Quinn and O'Toole are all magnificent. The characters are well-written and credible. The cinematography and editing are both state-of-the-art. Writing in general is excellent. The dialog is truly great, both as far as writing and delivery goes. This movie contains some highly memorable and impressive war scenes, as well, for anyone out there looking for that sort of thing. The film is a timeless classic that should be seen by just about anyone, regardless of their interest in fine film-making(which this is a prime example of) or historical accuracy(which this film seems to have more than its share of). I recommend this to anyone, but I suggest you make sure you have the patience for it. Put it on and watch it until the end. You won't regret it. I certainly didn't. 10/10",

Then, at the very end there is the juxtaposition of the Arab camel riders and the truck-borne Tommies singing their contrasting songs: different songs, different technologies, contrasting, conflicting cultures with Lawrence exiting history still not knowing to which culture his allegiance lies - as the driver comforts him with the thought that he is going ""home"" But is he really going home?",

Lean knew nothing of the Middle East and understood less. The film presents a completely false picture of it: glossy, saccharine and indeed patronising (and thus, borderline racist). The historical context is tendentious, biased and false: the centuries-old story of the Jews rebuilding their own country is barely given a supercilious nod. However great an actor Alec Guiness is, casting him as Feisal is just plain silly. Were there no actors of Middle Eastern background and appearance? He looks like an uncomfortable transplant from the East End of Charles Dickens, an Irish or Scottish princeling who took the wrong train at Holborn underground station. The notion that 'this is the best British film of all time' is as absurd as the film itself: glitziness does not equal quality.

231,26 February 2021,lyubitelfilmov,8," His Majesty's Partisan or Nearly ""The Lord's End"" of historical cinema","Historical drama. Well, I got to this epic, which I planned to watch eight years ago, when the disc with this picture was sold in our Soyuz chain of stores. But then it did not work, because the circumstances were higher. Well, now I got there, because I was carried away by old paintings (thanks to the beautiful Audrey Hepburn). I was almost completely delighted with the picture, well, here's my short opinion - His Majesty's Partisan. Despite this, there was one drawback in the picture, which I will definitely mention, but for now, let me focus your attention on the advantages of this epic historical drama.
So, here they are:
1. Scenario - the film tells about the life and service of Lieutenant (future colonel) of the British army Thomas Edward Lawrence, who received the nickname ""Arabian"" for his military exploits in the desert. The script is based on his autobiographical book The Seven Pillars of Wisdom. It was he who played a key role in the Arab uprising of 1916-1918 in the Middle East. This topic is quite interesting, where the interests of the leading powers of the world and the aspirations of the local population for independence collide. And it is interesting to follow this, although it will take a very long time (the picture goes for almost four hours). Politics, emotions of people on both sides, clash of cultures of two different worlds, personal experiences of the hero, and so on. Well, about the final, I can only say one thing: ""The Moor has done his job, the Moor can leave."" Vital, partly tragic, but true.
2. Lawrence of Arabia is a rather strange hero, I would say, even extravagant, we have here. He is brave, sometimes decisive, but his behavior drives into a stupor both his fellow British and Arabs, for whom he is a mystery. His reflection goes throughout the whole picture, but it's not boring to watch. Sometimes you are perplexed by his actions, but mentally you build a logical chain for this, and even find an excuse for the hero.
3. Two worlds - the picture shows the British and the Arabs, two completely different cultures and even worldviews in a difficult situation, when both peoples had common interests and they acted together against the once mighty Ottoman Empire. Moreover, the picture respects the customs of the Arab tribes, and does not exhibit them in a caricature. Yes, and the British shows who they were, especially politicians (who are the same in any country and under any political regime).
4. Scale - the scale of this historical event is felt in the picture, because there are a lot of extras here and everyone performs verified movements and allows the viewer to believe in what is happening. Trains, planes, armored vehicles - everything is real, although it fires blank cartridges of course. Almost Lord of the Rings, almost!
5. Costumes, decorations - I can't say where exactly the picture was filmed, but definitely in the desert and adjacent territories. For everything looks realistic, because I watched the restored version. The costumes are of the highest standard and look authentically of the sought after era. Although there are clearly exaggerated details, this does not spoil the image.
6. Gorgeous music - what else catches in this picture is the musical accompaniment. Where the London Symphony Orchestra played a key role. And you can listen to it for a long time and even separately from the picture, and have fun. Music creates the right atmosphere and perfectly underlines the key moments of the story being told. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!
7. Politics is a cynical and insidious craft, which played its role here too. Cruel, unfair (although not without a certain logic). She is present in the whole picture, like the shadow of Hamlet's father, and enters the stage at the right and most logical moment, throwing her dirty hands into the desert that has not yet cooled with blood. That's all right. For the soldiers, politicians always come, who will bury the young guys with honors, and after an hour they will forget about their existence, drinking brandy in their office.
Now about the minus. Why are there no large-scale battles? After all, you have an epic canvas on a historical theme, right? So why are there practically no battles here? A couple of camel races and some tinsel on the railroad doesn't count. I understand that in Lawrence's book it was, but you are shooting an artistic picture, where the genre itself allows you to deviate from the canon and show staginess. So why didn't they? It's a shame, because the potential was revealed, but not completely.
And yet - the picture is very long and at least forty minutes can be safely cut out and the meaning and logic will not be broken. The godlessly stretched scene spoils the overall impression.
A little about the main characters:
1. Lawrence of Arabia performed by Peter O'Toole - an officer in the British army who became the organizer and symbol of the Arab uprising. A brave, daring commander who earned the trust of the Arabs and even fell in love with them. The hero is non-standard, and therefore deserves attention. Peter did a great job with the role that opened up Hollywood for him, but I first saw him in the great comedy How to Steal a Million. Moreover, outwardly, Peter is very similar to Lawrence. Bravo!
2. Sheriff Ali, played by Omar Sharif, is an influential Arab of one of the many tribes, who at first disliked Lawrence, but later became his best friend. A brave, decisive and colorful hero who glorified the Egyptian actor Omar Sharif all over the world, and deserves it. Bravo Omar!
I cannot fail to mention Anthony Quinn, who played the role of the charismatic leader Audu ibu Tayi.
The picture received seven Oscar statuettes, and each is absolutely deserved!
This is exactly how you need to approach the restoration of the classics. Why can't domestic publishers do this? We don't have our classics? Yes, there is, only there is no desire.
As a result, he has a good historical drama, with an excellent script, grandiose scale, great costumes and sets, great music and great acting.

252,28 March 2023,Horst_In_Translation,8," Always has been an epic, always will be","""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a British film that is mostly in the English language and rarely you will also hear some Arabic and Turkish. The British background is the reason why I got to watch this movie on the occasion of a retrospective dealing with cinema from the UK and it was a one-time showing and I do not regret one bit going. It was not the first time I saw this film, not sure if the second or third time, but it has aged so well that its incredibly massive over 3.5 hours flew by quickly. Like they literally do not go faster with any other film. This one is from 1962, so it had its 60th anniversary last year, which means that pretty much everybody who worked on this is gone now sadly, except the little boy who plays Anthony Quinn's son here. I am not sure about him. But before I get to the cast, let's take a deeper look at the production behind the camera here. The director is David Lean and this is maybe his career-defining work, even if there are one or two other movies where he was in charge of that made an (almost) equally big impact. He was in his early 50s at that point. The two writers are Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson. The former scored his first Oscar nomination for the screenplay here, but lost. Still he went on to win for his two following nominations then and one of them was another David Lean movie. Wilson had already won two Oscars by 1962 and also worked with Lean on other occasions. You can see Lean's status as a defining filmmaker from his era also through the comments that Klaus Kinski made about him at some point. Lean's movie here won a total of seven Oscars and was nominated for three more. It feels kinda sad if we compare this masterpiece of a movie here to the movie that won seven Oscars in 2023, one that was not awfully bad, but still the difference in class could not be any bigger. The Oscars should really ask themselves what is going wrong with them and that film by the way was even nominated for another four Oscars, not just three. This little snippet of information makes you wonder if the Oscars are really pointless altogether at this point now in the 21st century.",
253,4 December 2011,MovieGuy109,10," Long, spectacular David Lean epic.",David Lean's 1962 blockbuster filmed on a grand scale still remains one of the most influential blockbusters of all time with battle scenes that still look amazing today. It tops even The Bridge on the River Kwai in terms of epic storytelling. Peter O'Toole hits the character of Lawrence right on the nose and Guinness also gets a great role that allows him to expand with his acting technique. Yet the budget and the sheer effort that went into this filmmaking is what really makes this one so interesting to watch for over 3 hours. Few blockbusters have such an emphasis on psychological idiosyncrasies than Lean's film. That is why Lean is more advanced in storytelling against DeMille or Stevens.,

And, while Peter O'Toole and the other fine actors in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (Alec Guiness, Omar Sharif, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quinn, Jose Ferrer among them) help make this a great picture, this film -- more than the others -- belongs to Lean himself. The scenes in the desert, the panoramic camera shots, the unhurried pace of the action are knock-your-socks-off brilliant. In fact, I'm hard put to think of another movie that rivals ""Lawrence"" in this respect. As someone else has remarked, this is a film that needs to be seen in a theater. The small screen can't begin to do it justice. I'm inclined to doubt that a giant TV screen (which I do not possess) will do the job. This is a BIG picture in every respect. A great picture in every way imaginable. In celebrating Lean's contribution, I don't mean to slight the acting which is superb. Peter O'Toole deserves all the superlatives that have been lavished on him. Guiness is Guiness, one of the finest actors of his generation. And enough can't be said about Anthony Quinn. Quinn does unlettered, vital,virile and larger than life better than anyone else ever has.

David Lean is by far my favorite director and his influence can be seen in countless other films. Peter O'Toole is by far my favorite actor and this is probably his greatest performance, although The Ruling Class is equally stunning. If you would like some insight into the huge mess in the Middle East, this is one film you must watch. Martin Scorsese commented that ""Lawrence"" could never be made today. I agree but for different reasons. I do not think there is any director alive today who has the insight, the patience or the work ethic that was needed to make ""Lawrence"" Devoting millions of dollars to an intelligent historic epic would also be something that today's movie makers would never venture into. David Lean was one of the last of a dying breed of precise filmmakers (Kubrick being the other) that went to any lengths and expense to get just the right shot.",

The opening sequence can be done better with a shorter sequence. The whole story gets pretentious and patronizing even from the very beginning. But it sure does depict the culture differences and the culture shocks Lawrence had very well. Those depictions occur very much at the starts when he was first stationed in the Arabia, the journey to Faisal and the later journey to Aqaba. Lawrence's reactions and his reluctance in doing much of his reactions did very much the justice of one stranger in a new world of culture. The acting is quite an example of a transitioning from a rigid dialog of the old styled movies to the modern style of more fluid conversations in the movies. Peter O'Toole did well as Lawrence, capturing all those diverse and sometimes contradicting emotions and expressions. Anthony Quinn and Alec Guiness did nice in giving the balancing angle to the story as well as giving the Arab taste to the movie.

Lawrence - and his involvement in the Arab nationalist movement during World War I (and after - although the post-War material wasn't included.) The desert scenes are stark and beautiful (as you would expect a desert to be) but also portray the dangers of the desert (again as you would expect.) The portrayal of the Arabs is for the most part accurate (a bickering group of loosely allied tribes rather than any sort of unified nation) and the performances were generally very good. Peter O'Toole (in his earliest role of significance) was brilliant in his portrayal of Lawrence (effectively portraying divided loyalties and a sort of messianic - perhaps somewhat mentally unbalanced - sense of his own destiny.) Alec Guinness was surprisingly effective as Prince Feisal - the closest there was to an accepted leader of the Arabs. There are some excellent desert battle scenes (especially where the Arabs under Lawrence take out an Ottoman train and the attack on Damascus.)",

Actor Peter O'Toole is acting like he has a face of plastic, his face expression is always the same. I don't know if the film is completely historically correct, but I doubt it.

Granted its politics might be a bit slanted against the Turks - who are portrayed as uniformly sadistic, led by a particularly oleaginous Jose Ferrer as an army officer with unnatural designs on Lawrence - but this is redeemed by Lean's determination to provide a warts-and-all portrait of the central character. Lawrence might appear attractive with his blond hair and jaunty manner, but he is also obsessive, imperialistic and ultimately dismissive of the Arabs he pretends to support. Despite all protestations to the contrary, he remains neo-colonialist in attitude, adopting Arab dress and Arab mores as a way of furthering his own interests. His fellow-officers understand this - even though they express their disapproval in a particularly supercilious manner - but Lawrence remains blissfully ignorant, determined in his belief that he is fighting on behalf of a just cause.

303,23 May 2019,truemythmedia,10, A Perfect Film,"I love this movie; it has one of the most interesting characters in epic stories, and what's even better is its based on a real person. I know it's a cliché, the cinephile lamenting that they don't make movies the way they used to, but you know what? They don't. This is a jewel from the golden age of Hollywood, back when the words 'epic film' meant more than just the size of the explosions they showed you (looking at you Marvel and DC). It really spoke to the scope of the characters, the sets, the story itself, and the amount of work that went into creating an artistic vision this brilliant.
This is one movie that I think everyone should see. It's more than fifty years old, but it still has more impact than ninety-nine percent of the epic films that come out today. Yes, it's long; yes, it takes patience. So what? Wait for a rainy Saturday, a frigid snowy Sunday, and make a day out of watching this movie. I promise you wont regret it.",

Of the 72 films to have won a Best Picture Oscar, David Lean has directed two; and I suspect (but I'll let you know when I've seen them all) that his are the best two.  The other one is ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"".  This is almost Kwai's companion piece.  In some ways Colonel Nicholson and Lawrence could scarcely be more different: the former is completely transparent, the latter utterly opaque.  But both films are studies in wartime leaders with unusual codes of honour.  Although both films are tragedies, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a far greater tragedy: it's ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" with all the optimism drained out.  It is terrible, sad, bleak, exquisitely depressing.  So why does it leave audiences feeling so exhilarated?  Why does one find oneself walking on air out of the cinema?  Simply, I think, because it's so very, very good.  Like Beethoven's music, it will thrill you even if it's in a minor key; possibly it will thrill you and sadden you at the same time; but certainly it will thrill you.",

O'Toole's portrayal of TE Lawrence and his transformation from a man that abhors blood and violence to one that is caught up in his own image, possibly as a prophet, maybe as a general, it does not matter which. We see a man, brought up in a theoretical and educated realm. Even with his military background, from the onset, Lawrence is unprepared for warfare and death. Every person early on in the film that gets close to Lawrence ends up dead as a direct or indirect result of him. This completely changes him which manifests itself in his bloodthirsty battle cry towards the end of the film. His desire for glory (seemingly) is reminiscent of ancient myths where immortality extends to those that prove themselves on the battlefield and gain fame from it. Eventually, he realizes the terror he has become and that his power is limited. Some of this occurs when he realizes he was betrayed by his own people, leaving him empty.",

I am no plot hound or action junky, but lets speed things up shall we! Sweeping cinematography cannot carry a movie.  I can't emphasize enough how lacking this movie is in story.

Many directors tried to bring the story to the screen - Lewis Milestone, Zoltan Korda, William K. Howard, and Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger - with numerous stars considered for the lead, including Robert Donat, Leslie Howard, Laurence Olivier, and Cary Grant.  With a cast led by newcomer Peter O'Toole and nearly two years spent shooting in the desert, Lean emerged with a vast and compelling study of Lawrence.  The film is remarkable for its central character's ambiguous personality, confused motivations and sexuality, his love/hate of violence, as well as its extraordinary design and cinematography.",
311,4 October 2009,johnmschofield,10, This epic is one of those films which oozes quality,This is another one of those films that I don't watch very often and one of the reasons is I know how great it is. The real T E Lawrence apparently looked unremarkable compared to Peter O'Toole and yet his presence at the places he visited during his life resulted in genuine life changing repercussions for a enormous number of people. This film is a journey as the director puts it and if Steven Spielberg regards this film as his all time favourite then it is a journey anybody should make. It is a long film between 3 and 4 hours depending on which version you see but it oozes quality and if you lose yourself in it from the start you will barely notice the time. I watched it for the first time when I was in my early twenties and I was blown away by everything about it. I am not that bothered which individual won this or that award for their part in it because it is a team effort and potentially there were hundreds of professionals involved and they should all be congratulated for producing this wonderful film. This film was made almost fifty years ago but quality is always enduring and fortunately for the viewing public this epic is sheer quality.

It is true that the Arabs is a puppet to the American till now. But that's not the point! The point is how a good movie should be created. David Lean has proved that an epic movie should be like this one! It's just another masterpiece such as Gone With The Wind!

318,20 March 1999,Don-102,10, This is what an Epic is supposed to be - absorbing AND audacious.,"There were all kinds of huge Hollywood productions in the 50' and 60's, beginning with 1952's THE ROBE.  Their common traits were that they were mostly biblical or Roman in theme, ran well over 3 hours, and were shot in CinemaScope or Super Panavision 70, both massive wide-screen processes. LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is not biblical, nor is it an ancient Roman story.  It is a 20th Century account of one man's personal fight to change the face of history and third world politics.  It is far better than the films of the previous mold, because it is far more believable and timeless.  We may not learn much about T.E. Lawrence as a man, but his actions and incredible ambition tell us a lot.  The monumental look of the film does not overshadow our involvement in Lawrence's plight and we do care for this strange, intelligent little man who may have become a God to his Arab counterparts, and, to himself.",

Seeing this film is escaping through vicarious interpretation of history on a great adventure through a daring metaphor comparing the life of one man to the clash of civilization where it is said to have originated. This is an interesting contrast to the mundane, civilized life of the English countryside where our protagonist and lead character, Mr. Lawrence meets his untimely demise, not for lack of boredom on a motorized conveyance after returning home from traversing the vast desert on a camel, risking life and limb, in a daring raid.",
326,22 May 2011,rdukeesq,9, wow,"So I watched the award winning Lawrence of Arabia from 1962. Well is it a classic well yeah that's an easy one. This movie stars Peter O'toole as the sexually ambiguous T. E Lawrence who led the Arabs to freedom in the early part of the last century. This movie was directed by David Lean who also won an academy award for ""The bridge over the river kwai"". What both these movies have in common is a grand scope and an eye for detail that is unparalleled in most movies. The movie has one problem it is 3 hours and 35 minute before the final credits start. It is only a big deal if you are planning to watch it in one sitting, but in general it doesn't play long. The long slow scenes don't play so because you really are brought into those seemingly infinite deserts and feel the struggle for survival experienced by the characters. This movie is about as well made as you can get, there is a fair amount of testosterone thrown around but this movie should appeal to both sexes.

Knowing the Arab people it is difficult to believe this plot, however, it is an extraordinary film about a person with his own personality, pride, willingness and intense feelings of love and hate. Peter O'Toole made his debut in this classic in an extraordinary way; his acting was excellent jointly with those of Anthony Quinn, Alec Guinness and Omar Sharif. One of the best things the film revealed was the intention of French and British to occupy the whole Arab area occupied by Turkey once the first world war would have been over, and it happened in that way. Syria and Lebanon went for France while the rest remained in British possession. The film also illustrates that this whole area was Arab with several tribes without any concept of nationality, and there were no borders between the present territories of Jordan, Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and others. The borders were invented artificially later with the western occupation creating tiny nations, so you may guess why. Various historical and cultural ingredients make this film interesting. I must acknowledge that at certain point of the film I saw this Lawrence as a kind of Tarzan in the Arab world, but I do not know whether the story is a real one and if this Lt. Lawrence existed.",

As an anthropologist who worked with camel and cattle Bedouins for many years in Africa and the Middle East, I can only say the films captures much of the intrigue and paradox that makes up these fascinating people.  Er Lawrence (as he preferred to be called) was likewise paradoxical, mercurial and contradictory.  The film is just a masterpiece of cinematography and storyline.  The myth of this amazing man comes to life in more ways than one.  There are dozens of historical treatments on the Arabian campaign (called the ""Revolt in the Desert"" by Lawrence) and even more biographies of TE Lawrence, later AKA Shaw.  None of them answer the questions that persist to intrigue us and perhaps, as the years slid by, we'll never know the true face behind the mask of a man, who on the outside surface was shy, retiring and self-effacing and at the same time who through his correspondence with such great lights as GB Shaw became a political gadfly.

Every aspect of the film, from the narrative structure to the staging of shots, revolves around exploring not just what T. E. Lawrence did but why he did it, and what it cost him. The desert is a recurring image, but it's not simply a stunning landscape. Shots linger on vast emptiness, and suggest a blank canvas on which Lawrence can paint whatever he wishes. Profoundly alienated from his family and home culture, Lawrence pulls on the robes and persona of the man he might have been, if he'd been born an Arab. The deeper his insecurities reach, the farther his ambitions must go. He conquers the desert, and the desert conquers him, demanding payment for every personal triumph.",

He then softly blows the flame out, as we cut to a dark orange horizon on a desert plain. We are first stunned by the vastness of the deep horizon. As we watch, the faintest hint of yellow sun is seen coming over what seems the edge of the world. As the masterful score quietly begins to play, the sun slowly works it's way into the world's view. As the music reaches a climax, we cut to what seems the most beautiful shot of desert land space that we could possibly imagine.

361,4 January 2006,erniemunger,9, Did Jesus overact?,"Anyone foolish enough to think that this is not one of the best movies ever to have been made  embodying the very essence of what makes cinema stand out among all other cultural forms of expression  should stick to Matrix, Disneyland and Diet Coke. Pointing out its historic inaccuracy is simply redundant as it never claimed to be a documentary, and biopics generically put an emphasis on story development rather than truthfulness (cf. JFK, Patton, etc.). Lamenting the movie's pace is, at best, indicative of your dwindling attention span  you might as well ask yourself if the Bible's too long. Finally, bemoaning the over-the-top acting of the entire cast, but most notably O'Toole, is an anachronism as you're dealing with pre-method-acting Hollywood and there's no concern whatsoever with realism, let alone naturalism; besides, the film, more than anything else, is a psychological portrait meant to express (as in ""expression"") the inner turmoil of its main protagonist in the face of events bigger than life. Not to forget that O'Toole's character is ripe with homo-erotic innuendo, and subsequently his struggle against his inner demons must also be read as a self-denial of his sexuality, as is made obvious in the rape scene. Indeed, not least thanks to O'Toole's ethereal performance, T.E. Lawrence is portrayed as an outsider in every sense of the word, a pariah of both worlds whose acceptance he is desperately seeking. One of the countless merits of Lean's desert western is to make evident this struggle of the individual against society and conventions  but also its shortfalls , revealing itself in extreme situations that command extreme feelings. And rather than serving up an insipid happy end (as it would no doubt have to were it produced today), Lawrence of Arabia tells of the factual prevalence of pragmatism over ideals, of society over the individual, of tribalism over humanity, and not least, of war over peace  a gloomy message that couldn't possibly be more to the point, here served by a Homeric plot, a legendary score, sweeping photography, and immortal actors.",

390,16 April 2020,elldbry772,10," ""Well nil nisi bonum....""","Epic, this word has become part of modern day slang. So therefore it is often overused. It makes me laugh every time, because this movie is the standard of epic that makes everything else fall short. Big things have small beginnings, or so I'm told. Just like T.E. Lawrence map maker and obscure British army officer stationed in Arabia. He goes on an adventure to fight the Turks, while being assimilated into the Arab culture. The movie's director, David Lean, had a problem: how do you create Arabia and cast Arab actors. Don't, instead go to Arabia and make the locals part of your movie. Have the major speaking roles done by the best actors you can get and respect the characters they are playing. Also find the right man to play Lawrence. Who can show a man who is out of his element and does not fit in at all, and convince you he is part of his adopted culture. Cast Peter O'Toole. O'Toole is one of the best. His role takes him from the basement of British army headquarters to the charge at the Port City of Aqaba. Only a few men can make that journey, and only few actors can play that man. But sometimes you need one extra ingredient. Omar Sharif, who plays Sharif Ali, was to charge at Aqaba with O'Toole. Sharif was in his tent sitting at a table. O'Toole walks in and with Sharif still in costume looks like a nun with a mustache. Finally O'Toole asks 'what are you doing Omar?' Sharif 'I'm working out the odds Peter.' 'Odds?' 'Yes, the odds of the camel falling over during the charge, or me falling off the camel.' 'I see and what have you decided?' 'It is more likely for me to fall off the camel.' 'What are you going to do?' 'I'm going to tie myself to the camel.' 'Well Omar I'm going to get drunk.' 'Oh Peter I'm going to get drunk too.' So on the day of the charge where T.E. Lawrence leads his army against the Turkish stronghold at Aqaba. That made one reviewer call the look on O'Toole's and Sharif's face as 'Messiahanic zeal', the actors had no idea what was happening. The best scene in the movie and O'Toole doesn't know where the heck he is going, doing and riding or when to stop. Luckily the camel stopped at the ocean and the last thing O'Toole saw was Sharif's camel running up with Sharif tied to the camel but rolled over under the camel's belly. That is acting I suppose. The music is also epic, the sound of the desert, a great terrain that needs a soundtrack to bring out the grandeur of the desert. From violent heat to mind bending mirages the desert became another character in the movie. That character is under the rule of Prince Faisal, although he is warring with the Turks. Alec Guiness plays the prince, in one of the most respectful cross ethnicity portrayals you can get. People who knew the actual prince would say that Guiness' mannerisms, voice cadence, and demeanor were so close to the real prince they did not care that he was a Brit. Anthony Quinn plays Auda Abu Tayi, chief of a Bedouin tribe that joins Lawrence's cause. And in pure Quinn style steals the screen with his intensity and memorable lines. The film took two years to make, as long and as tough as the journey through the Nefud desert. However the legacy of Lawrence of Arabia is nearly incomparable. So many filmmakers marvel at it to the point where they think there is absolutely no way they can make a movie as good. If you wanted to remake it the way the original was made it would cost close to three hundred million dollars. And if you did it with special effects and modern techniques it would be so fake it would be unwatchable. I was able to watch it after hearing about it's grandeur and epic story, and I agree with the masses. It is one of the best with it's elements entertaining to this day.

400,22 September 2001,Kakueke,10, Lean's masterpiece,"A masterpiece of cinematography and screenplay, Lawrence of Arabia will always be an all-time classic.  Although movies preceding the early 60s could sometimes bring out some negative qualities in a looked-up-to historical figure, this one was fairly unique at the time in bringing out specifically the disturbing side, as well as the heroic stature.   The latter is not deemphasized either, even as Lawrence's more ordinary moral conflicts become apparent.  Anyway, the overall screenplay, so well-written, is in itself as worthy a focus as the individual character of Lawrence.  The film serves as a bit of a ""Ball Four"" (yes, I emphasize ""a bit"") to later negative movie commentaries on war and political intrigues.  And as to visuals, the desert becomes as beautiful a place as the sea, the mountains, the forests, and the sky.  As one who considers ""Lawrence"" an all-time favorite, I will nevertheless acknowledge that it drags a bit in both the first and second halfs.  Ultimately, tho, the story justifies the length and all the scenes.",

405,6 January 2014,robert-259-28954,10, The greatest epic ever filmed... period.,"Very few pictures can truly be called, ""epic,"" and few have worn the title so well for so long. It seems the older this film gets, the better it gets, on every conceivable level. May I start by saying that this movie could NOT have been made today. The sheer budgetary concerns, combined with the fact that no studio wants a picture this long, this deliberately slowly-paced, and one that cannot be made into a video game or sequels for prepubescent teenagers. Every great film requires greatness on every level, and this one fulfills that contract in spades - the locations, the actors, the script, the direction, the story itself - all larger than life. But particular attention should be paid to the casting, first-rate from top to bottom. No studio today would have taken a chance on using a relatively green actor as O'Toole in such a role! His choice was truly inspired. And the supporting cast, well, let's just say that it utilized the very best talent alive at the time, perhaps ever. Particularly a star turn by a superb and restrained Alec Guinness as Faisal, another great performance by the always powerful Anthony Quinn, even an underrated job by Arthur Kennedy, who's strong and believable all-American characters seem to capture the spirit of Americans like none other (he's seldom given the credit he deserves). Claude Raines was wonderful as the stoic, tongue-in-cheek politician, and in the twilight of his career, a fitting monument to his accomplishments. And can we forget the short but powerful scene by Mel Ferrer as the Turkish commandant? He's the reason they say, ""It's not the size of the part, but the talent of the actor."" At first, he turned down the 15-minute part, but we are all the better for it that he agreed. But in the end, this project belongs to the legendary David Lean, who's magnificent vision was only equaled by that of T.E. Lawrence himself.",

Peter O's Toole who plays T.E. Lawrence, who played a decisive role in unifying the divided Arab tribes. The personality of Lawrence is a complicated one that makes watching the movie interesting. Till the far end it is difficult to understand the side that Lawrence takes. Peter has done a pretty commendable job while portraying Lawrence's personality. Based on true events, the movie too is directed and plated on a realistic note moving the viewer experience the trials that desert life offers while at the same time the dark face and politics of the colonial powers. Lawrence is a compassionate person yet he has to kill out of unprecedented circumstances. A time comes when the entire Arab follows Lawrence but he is not one to use it. Rather, he works inherently towards unification. Disobeying the superior orders, he maintains the dignity of the local people while trying to solve their problems through dialogue. He plays a crucial role in helping Prince Feisel conquer Gulf of Aqaba through the land route.

416,16 June 2020,richardtownsley-19550,10, The Greatest Historical Epic Ever Made,"There is a moment in Lawrence of Arabia when the hero, T.E. Lawrence, and his guide, after a long trek across the desert, stop at a well to drink. Lawrence turns around to see a distant speck in the far distance, reluctantly shimmering in the desert heat, like a mirage. The speck reluctantly approaches the camera, before materializing into what looks like a man. There is absolutely no music, only the sounds of the desert winds and the footsteps of the man approaching. What are his intentions? We do not know. But judging by the reaction of Lawrence's guide, they must not be good. The man comes closer to the camera, until the suspense becomes so unbearable that Lawrence's guide runs to the nearest weapon--only to be shot. On television, this shot doesn't work at all; nothing can be seen, nothing can be heard. In a movie theater, looking at the stark clarity projected on the screen, the sound of the desert surrounding us, we lean forward and strain to bring a detail out of the waves of heat, and for a moment we experience some of the actual vastness of the desert, and its unforgiving harshness. I myself have only experienced 4 movies in the theater: Lawrence of Arabia, which remains one of my favorite films, Shazam, which wasn't half bad, and Home, which was. My family also went to see the sequel to Percy Jackson, and quite frankly, the first one wasn't even that good. And despite the fact that these movies may not be very good, the experience of watching it in the theater was enough to make them a memorable experience. Unfortunately, despite having huge blockbusters last year, ticket sales have been going down the past few years, and, given the current circumstances, it is unlikely that new generations will be able to experience the magic of the cinema.",

423,8 January 2021,finnegan-08789,10," One of the Last True Epics, filmed by perhaps the greatest film director of this or any time!","Filmed in a two year period, this picture took decades to be realized. It's not easy to tell the story of the Arab uprising against the Turks and the Ottoman Empire, especially during this fragmented time period in World War I
The script by Robert Bolt paints an accurate and painful portrait of T.E. Lawrence, both the good and the bad. The source material is both""The Revolt in the Desert"" and ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom"".
The music is a multidimensional character that enhances every scene where it is used. Maurice Jarre has given us a juggernaut of a score. He can write the major musical interludes for a Symphony Orchestra or a Military marching band. He can even write music for the ancient Arabian stringed instruments that echo the unheard sounds of the desert.
This is Peter O'Toole's first major film part. As David Lean said during his screen test, ""Stop, the boy is Lawrence!"" O'Toole doesn't disappoint.
Jack Hawkins as Allenby, Anthony Quayle as Brighton, Omar Sharif as Sherif Ali, Anthony Quinn as Auda Abu Tay, Arthur Kennedy as Jackson Bentley (actually Lowell Thomas and Alec Guinness as Prince Fiesel all give Oscar caliber performances. But let's talk about the Production Design, which may never be surpassed even using CGI. Lean had his staff and local Spanish labor construct the city of Aquaba, right down to the last of three hundred plaster buildings, all done in an ancient riverbed on the coast of Spain. Just for good measure, they built a complete Army camp for the Turkish army. Lawrence and his Arab army destroy the Turkish camp and army and then ""take their boots"".
As a yardstick, Steven Spielberg was asked what this picture would cost to make in today's dollars. Without missing a beat, Spielberg said $260,000,000.

Lawrence of Arabia not only ranks right up there with great action epics such as GUNJA DIN, THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING but holds its own against such classic movies as CITIZEN KANE, THE GODFATHER AND SCHINDLER'S LIST.

The first part of the movie had some good parts, but was so incredibly slow that I could hardly stand it. Take, for example, the scene where Lawrence meets Sheriff Ali. We see Ali as a dot in the distance--perhaps 1000 feet away. Guess what happens? The camera stays trained on Ali for all 1000 of those feet, not once cutting away. It takes 2 minutes for that man to ride up to Lawrence on his camel. Believe me, there are many other scenes like this in the first part. It is torture.

I had watched LoA before on TV; but as usual with widescreen movies on a 27 inch TV in the 80's, the film didn't leave any impression on me, except, that it's damn long. When in 1989 the remastered, means longer version, came back to the movie theater, I went with friends to see it again. What a difference. Already the prelude with the red curtains still closed beamed me back to the 50's/60's, when all big movies had music to create the right feeling before the movie really started. Great photography, wonderful music that stays with you for weeks, and of course the acting of all the great names make this movie one of the few films, that I can watch over and over again. This film made Peter O'Toole known to the world, as well introduced Omar Sharif to the western world, although he was already a big star in Egypt and other middle eastern countries. The added material - missing for the better part of 27 years - gives a whole new insight to the person of Lawrence and the circumstances of the creation of an Arabic world with united countries, in contrast to hundreds and hundreds of tribes, that were fighting each other all the time. Some critics didn't like the violence, that take place in several scenes; but I believe these scenes of murder and violence only add to the feeling, to watch actually a documentary of what was going on, instead of just watching a mainstream movie. And besides, any PG 13 movies from the last 15 years has far more violence, than any scene in this movie. If you also feel dizzy after couple of minutes, watching modern movies with their in average every 0.8 sec edits and you would love to see wide visuals, that give you the feeling you are in the desert or by the oasis etc, watch this movie and enjoy.",

The psycological depth of the film has few parallels and having read Seven Pillars of Wisdom it certainly reflects Lawrence's psyché well. In terms of script and cinematography there is a short analysis by Sam Yates of one scene on You Tube that brilliantly shows the genius of Lean and why almost 60 years after it was made the film is still utterly mesmeric.

450,23 November 2021,dannyrovira-38154,10, ONE OF THE GREATEST EPIC FILMS EVER MADE,"David Lean's magnificent classic epic masterpiece is one of most visually stunning motion pictures of all-time thanks to Freddie Young's extraordinary Oscar winning cinematography which is some of the most beautifully poetic ever capture on celluloid. The film is a richly textured character study of the legendary T. E. Lawrence, brilliantly played by Peter O' Toole in an Oscar, Golden Globe Award nominated and BAFTA Film Award winning performance for Best Actor. O' Toole's star-making portrayal captures many of the nuances and character subtleties of this complex insecure and deeply troubled hero who struggled all his life with his homosexuality, it shows his exploits and his emergence from odd out of place British Army Officer to respected and feared leader of Arab resistance which he led against the Turkish empire during World War I. Masterful Oscar winning direction by Lean, with a fascinating and intelligent Oscar nominated and BAFTA Film Award winning screenplay by Robert Bolt, and a majestic Oscar winning original score by Maurice Jarre. Flawlessly galvanizing supporting performances by Sir Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins, Claude Rains, Arthur Kennedy. Special kudos to Omar Sharif for his powerful Oscar nominated and Golden Globe Award winning performance as Sherif Ali. Winner of 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is number 5 on the American Film institute's list of the 100 greatest films ever made. Highly recommended.",
451,26 May 2009,sjmdd,8, An outstanding achievement - but not for modern viewers,"I watched this movie for the first time about 2 days ago, and id like to share my thoughts on the film. first allow me to explain my summary comment. (I'm not giving away any spoilers because i don't think there are any to give away) L o A was made during a time when movies had the word 'epic' rubberstamped all over them, in 1962, only three years after ben hur, 2 years after spartacus, 6 or 7 years after bridge on the river kwai, you get my point, when movies were made not necessarily to satisfy audience cravings, when visionary directors like David lean wanted to tell a story and the studio gave them whatever they wanted in order to achieve this. the movie runs in at very nearly 4 hours long, and i wont lie here, sometimes it feels like it. the length of the movie is, however the only criticism i can find, as acting, script,and cinematography are quite frankly out of this world and the sweat will run off you as lawrence frazzles in the heat. my point is that a great deal of young people will be unaccustomed to such attention to detail in a movie, when the answers are not thrust down your throat and somebody is not slaughtered every 5 mins. i realise I'm been cynical but the days when you could whack out a four hour masterpiece and expect your audience to lap it up are long gone.. but that does explain the low ratings, obviously from youngsters who viewed (part of)the movie and were bored stiff. well what did you expect? independence day? if your over 65, this movie is probably one of your all time favourites, but if your under 25, well, just avoid.",

In Return of the King, which I compare it to only in regard to its length, I was almost yelling at Frodo to get on the boat and get it over with. Lawrence I could watch campaign across the desert for a couple hours more, at least. This is also one of those movies that seems to have gained more meaning as it ages. Take, for example, the scenes of Lawrence teaching young Arabs how to make bombs. A little more unsettling than it was originally intended to be, perhaps. But the real story of course is not one of nations and wars, but of Lawrence's struggle with his identity in the face of the horrors he witnessed, and indeed, committed. How strange that after all of the killing and plundering he experienced, he was most horrified by the lies he half-knowingly told his Arab allies. Perhaps less strange that none of those gentlemen sitting around the conference table seemed to mind.",
453,26 November 2003,itaipu4,10," This is moviemaking on a unique scale,never equalled","Shocked that your database ranks this classic at #23,I suppose that its a generational thing again.This movie gives a whole new definition of perfection.I was fortunate enough to attend the premiere of this movie at the Odeon Carlton.Because the movie was shot in Super 70,the theatre reconfigured the screen.This movie's epic scale is unprecedented.The incredible cinematography,film editing,script by Robert Bolt,brings magic to the screen.Back in 1962,the cynical critics in Toronto,New York,acclaimed this movie with adjectives and metaphors that felt inadequate.The Theatre had to install 8 new pop machines as a result of the massive and overwhelming desert scenes. On a scale of 1 to 10,this movie is a 15.I saw a review that was critical of Peter O'Toole's acting ability,as the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket said,I don't believe you said that.I also watched this movie on the IMAX screen at Ontario Place in Toronto,if you ever want to find faults in a movie,watch it on this 5 storey screen,it shows no flaws.Today,the irony of this movie,is its historical perspective.Does everyone remember the scene after the takeover of Damascus where all the various factions of Arab Leaders were meeting to discuss the resolution of the aftermath.Does this not remind you of Iraq circa 2003? I find it chilling! Most notably was the political wrangling is only too glaringly familiar as we watch the same events unfold in the middle east Anybody who believes there is a solution for changing the mindset of that region is truly naive.Mr.Lean the world of cinema will miss your keen insight and talent.Politics of Hollywood and americana held this movie back in number of Oscars awarded.When you consider the awards given to Titanic,there is no justice.Peter O'Toole was robbed in spite of Gregory Peck's performance in ""To Kill a Mockingbird,but alas,Greg is an American.They need to create a new category for movies like Lawrence, because it is indeed,in a league by itself.

458,18 December 2015,j-penkair,8, Lean of Arabia,"This film is so well-celebrated for such a long time. Much like ""The Godfather"" or ""The Exorcist"", I thought there was nothing more to add, until I got to watch it up close recently. This time, I found the character of Major T.E. Lawrence to be one of the oddest characters of the so-called ""heroes"" in the history of world cinema. He is indeed larger than life, as they say, but he is also a psychologically challenging person whose real intent is never clear. At the time of its 1962 original release, not many films dare to feature an ambiguous character as their heroes. As a rebel, Lawrence is never as conventional as Lenin, Mao, or Che Guevara. His plight is terrifyingly personal, leading us to believe that his suppressed homosexuality may have something to do with his motivation. The Sadism and Masochism of a gay or non-gay person is another addition to such a murky drive. This psychoanalysis can go on and on. My point, though, is David Lean's unconventional selection of such topic of his epic. This goes for Robert Bolt, its script writer, and Peter O'Toole, as a first timer, too. These men take a great risk of being shunned by the scared public of such a progressive idea. Having said so, I think we must credit the flamboyant producer of this film, Sam Spiegel, as well. He risks being branded as a dubious character just to push the story of crazy Lawrence to the world, despite being the film's money man. David Lean, as we look back, is great because he possesses the dual qualities of the true lover of film process, and an unconventional view of the world and its ingredients as a society. In a way, Lean tells Lawrence's story because Lawrence represents him in some strangely rebellious and alienated vision of the world. These two layers of ""Lawrence of Arabia"", a grossly fun epic ride and a hidden critique of the world's pretentiousness, are exactly why this film just won't die away. It is a cultural treasure of mankind to be dug and dug again. The learning curve goes on.",

The attention to even the minutest detail is stunning, as if a Michelin-starred chef had built the most exquisite dish whilst adding the tiniest of infusions to layer the taste. The scope of the film demands the viewer to sit back in a comfy chair, with a glass of Pimms and lemonade, and watch the spectacle in its original format; to view on anything other than letterbox view loses some of the detail that, whilst almost un-noticeable, is essential.

There is an intermission; and that's good, because you may want to go and walk through some wet grass at this point just to remind yourself that there is more water in the world than sand. The story is basic - British Military Man aids Bedouin during WWI.  The rest is character development and scenery.  This may sound like belittlement, but its not. O'Toole's eyes bore through you like laser beams.  The scenery and camera work is amazing.  The action sequences are breathtaking.

In Lawrence's case, Englishmen playing Arabs and Arabs whooping and hollering like ""Injuns"" in an old Hollywood Western seem, thankfully, to belong to a time of movie-making quite past. Another difficulty of the film is that it portrays quite a confusing character, as T.E. Lawrence the man is nearly beyond comprehension and largely an enigma. Peter O'Toole does an admirable job, but in the end, his character still has to remain an enigma--for an actor, that must be difficult.

Artists are what created this masterpiece. I am extremely pleased that LOA was a huge success with the academy - especially with David Lean who deserved the Oscar immensely, as he represents the honour of the British; considering British film-makers/actors have been ripped off by the Academy (Hitchcock,Harris, Burton, Sellers, and NOW O'TOOLE!!!!). Now talking about the Academy ripping off the British; this movie is the perfect example - Peter O'Toole!!!! His performance in this is ranked 1st on many lists of ""The greatest movie performances of all time"" (above Brando's 'On the waterfront' performance) and yet he was never acknowledged properly...his performance was memorizing. He made T.E look eccentric and strange, but truly special and unique in the first five minutes on screen!...his performance developed throughout; from the moral genius and good man - to the arrogant and war-obsessed general (he basically BECAME one of the barbaric Arabs). His performance is in my opinion THE greatest ever! The supporting roles were also stunning - Omar Sharif's superior warrior presence, yet emotionally vulnerable Sheriff Ali and Anthony Quinn's bad ass Auda Abu Tayi really captured the mentality and human environment of arabia during Lawrence's campaign.

Even more endless than this desert, however, are the sheer complexities of the human soul, both in its capacity for good as well as evil, and in almost no other person were these inner depths and contradictions explored deeper and further than in Thomas Edward Lawrence, whose wartime exploits in Arabia were immortalized in David Lean's 1962 classic Lawrence Of Arabia, one of the last (and one of the best) ""hurrah!""s of the old-school Hollywood historical epic, and also just one of the best films of all time, period.",

This movie is extremely exciting and you are always hanging on the edge of your seat to see what happens next.  It is amazing in the theater( I was lucky enough to catch it while in theaters for two days).  Lawrence has brilliant cinematography, great directing, amazing acting, and an extraordinary screenplay.  The way it shows Lawrence changing and becoming insane is remarkable.

""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a film where the natural, wild beauty of the desert, provides the perfect set for the unfolding of T.E. Lawrence's adventures. The splendid photography, both beautiful and meaningful, revealed the life and soul of the landscape, while the unmatched music score gave the blood for the heart of the film. The actors. Peter O' Toole, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, and the rest of the cast, directed superbly by David Lean, gave one of the best performances of their rich careers. Maybe the best.

I am wring this review to remind viewers the LOA has more relevance now than it did then. The concern then, 1962, was the Cold War. Today, it is the disastrous conditions on the locations where David Lean discovered the tracks of trains T.E. Lawrence blew up during his campaign, exactly 100 years ago. Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson authored the script, but is was Lean's direction that created one of the greatest films of all time. The film should be honored now for its prescience.

522,2 May 2006,jdm2030,10, Epic masterpiece of a man struggling with his identity,"The movie begins with the overture playing over a black screen. In reality, it is an important start to the movie- we are faced with a wavy, dreamy piece full of different undertones that relate specifically to the main character of Lawrence, alluding to the different forces in his mind and allowing the viewer to imagine, if not dream, of expectations of things to come. We have a man who grapples with his identity: he has a deep interest in the desert and in the beginning tries hard to fit in with a culture and peoples he feels are his own. He has an illusion of what he would like to be, an idea already mapped out in his mind, of what the arab peoples are, and how he, too, can hopefully become one, assimilate himself where he feels at home. The rigid constructs, however, of this illusion begin to fall apart as he fails to understand or admit to certain aspects of the culture he cannot deal or cope with: constant violence, the ever-present idea of death, and the lack of the peoples to come together and progress as a nation. He slowly begins to change, as little by little he becomes frustrated with the way things are, a way completely different than what he would like to be, a way that in the end lead him to take a pessimistic view on life, a hateful anger that he turns to the world because things have failed to go the way he chooses. The open desert, the beautiful landscapes, are all the setting for the freedom to do what one dreams to do- so long as he believes he can do it. But as he soon learns, there are things that he cannot change, and his character, his own sense of self, deteriorates.",

I did not like however all the historical inaccuracies as well as the mischaracterisations of Lawrence, Allenby, and Auda Abu Tayi. Lawrence in real life was the opposite of the way he is shown here. Also, in real life Allenby considered Lawrence ""one of his dearest friends"". What I said about Lawrence is the same for Tayi. When this movie was released, his descendants filed a lawsuit against Columbia pictures saying their father had been misrepresented. It went on for about 10 years before the lawsuit was dropped. Also, Gasim was one of four characters created for the picture. The scene where Lawrence shots him after he confesses to killing someone was put in to stir Anti-War Sentiments at the time. David Mclean was very Anti-War. It's not that I didn't like the movie. It's when characters are created, stuff added that never happened and events not included. All I'm saying is that if I watch a film biography, I want the truth and nothing but the truth! No invented characters, no misrepresentations of anybody or any of that other crap. I want to be able to look online and see that everything that was in the movie actually happened. Also, Lawrence in the movie says he doesn't know about the Sykes-Pinchot Treaty. Wrong!

I dont understand how this movie was such a big hit.  It could have been an hour shorter and it still would have been too long. All the desert scenes were actually starting to make me thirsty. The camera tried to portray Peter O Toole as this Jesus-like character, but ended up making him look like some homosexual weakling.  Dont believe me?  Then watch how he walks.  Or the look on his face when he killed that man. I kept thinking ""Ok, maybe the good part's coming up,"" right up until the end.

The film is almost four hours long (it its restored version), it features no females with speaking roles, it has a modicum of action, and the dialog is even sparse.  Yet, if ever a piece of film warranted multiple viewings it would have to be Lawrence of Arabia, the pinnacle of David Lean's career.

But the editing of this film is sloppy, and it could be tightened into a two hour and forty five minute to three hour movie. It drags in certain parts, shots are held too long. The character development is obviously the most extraordinary part of this film, watching you feel like you are getting to know Lawrence as if you are actually with him. However, despite the fact it is a classic, which no one argues, with great acting and wonderful cinematography, I think that older people glamorize some of the negatives of movies like this while not giving newer movies their due credit. The editing techniques that have been developed in the last twenty years are masterful and astonishing, and while some of these techniques have their roots in older masters like Eisenstein their originality and style are all their own. I am tired of hearing that everything is a copy of this or a knock off of that.

552,6 April 2004,madmax-1,10, The greatest epic of all time.,"An enthralling masterpiece. T.E Lawrence, one of history's most astounding figures, is wonderfully played by the illustrious Peter O'Toole. This movie entertained me from beginning to end; from the beautiful score in the beginning, to the bittersweet ending. Wonderful characters emerge throughout this grandiose film.  Omar Sharif, in the film that made him a star, plays Ali brilliantly.  His raw emotion and chemistry with Lawrence is mesmerizing.  King Feisal is played by the always magnificent Alec Guiness, who shows us that great actors only get better through their movies.  And let us not forget Anthony Quinn, playing Auda abu Tayi.  Quinn has to be one of the greatest actors of his generation.  With Jack Hawkins as Brighton, a star contrast to Lawrence, and Claude Rains who plays the very dry Mr Dryden. Containing some of the most violent scenes of it's time, the battle scenes seem to become larger than life (especially on a home-entertainment system like I watched it on!) and depict the Arab cavalrymen in all their glory.  The desert scenes are beautifully shot, and the exasperatingly large amount of work that director David Lean puts into the film comes out wonderful. One of the top five greatest movies ever made, and the greatest epic ever made.  I recommend this movie to whomever wants to watch a film that will take you to Arabia in WWI, surrounded by the greatest actors of their time, and all time. Makes sure you don't miss Lawrence of Arabia!",

It continues to hold my attention as I watch this film nearly every year, and it seems to only get better. The fight scenes in the desert and the dialogue between O'Toole and Guinness are perfection. Lawrence of Arabia is a 1962 British drama film based on the life of T. E. Lawrence. It was directed by David Lean but the real credit goes to Robert Bolt and Freddie Young who did the screenplay and cinematography respectively. Brilliant casting and the cinematography is beyond reproach. Rarely have I seen a film that gets this much better with age.

Boasting an utterly predictable, completely lame plot (yes, I'm aware it's based on fact; it's still really lame), the movie takes way way way too much time to tell said ""story"", and relies on performances that are so overacted I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the actors are still in character.

David Lean took his film crew to the desert, where he made not only an Oscar-winning film, but a timeless epic.  Thankfully, producer Sam Spiegel didn't get Marlon Brando for the title role of T.E.

564,8 June 2002,Robert R Jackson,10, Epics don't get any bigger.,"David Lean was born to direct ""big"" films. His mastery of working with his DP to compose for the widescreen aspect ratio still stands as the definitive work in the idiom. Of his three most ambitious films; The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), Lawrence Of Arabia (1962) and Dr. Zhivago (1965); this stands out as his most flawless accomplishment. It's a shame that all the audio tracks were lost to the ravages of time. Just two years before his death, Lean re-assembled the original cast in 1989 to replace *all* the dialogue when he set about restoring the film. That he was able to pull it off is quite a feat, but it's a shame to have lost all the original production dialogue. The restored film is a wonder, though. Almost every frame looks like a beautiful still photograph. The images that play across the screen are a wonder to behold and the skill with which the film is assembled is genius. Shots follow each other and build with a purpose and structure beyond the abilities of most filmmakers. And the story. The character of T.E. Lawrence is a misfit. He's not understood by the Arabs and he's not understood by the British. O'Toole's performance as Lawrence is powerful and poignant. Forty years after its initial release Lawrence of Arabia is more impressive than ever. It is one of the true wonders of 20th Century cinema.",

Set against a backdrop of political machinations and horrific battle scenes Lawrence of Arabia examines one man's battle with his lust for life and death, his battle with his sexuality and his battle with lust for glory. The supporting characters are rich and varied, with not a single false note as long as you can overlook Anthony Quinn's mustache. The British generals, French diplomat, Saudi royalty and American reporter all use Lawrence for their own ends and yet they cannot help being in awe of his abilities and the conflict that rages within him for all to see.",

It cost $2.50 a ticket which in 1963 was a very expensive movie indeed.  At the time I had never heard of Lawrence of Arabia so I didn't have a clue what the movie was about. Maybe it was my age, but Lawrence of Arabia had a profound effect on me. I had never seen anything matching the visual images in Lawrence.  It has led to a life long hobby of collecting movie stills and posters with a large number of items from Lawrence of Arabia.  I have every version put out on VHS, laserdisc, and DVD.  The two disc special edition DVD motivated me to purchase a large widescreen television.  It is David Lean's masterpiece and it represents the zenith in the careers of Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif. It is not often that your first role is your greatest but O'Toole and Sharif will always be remembered for their performances in this film.

He was transfered to the Middle East during the World War I, because Britain wanted to ally with Arabia to against Turkey. Being sent to Saudi Arabia, he met Prince Feisal, a tribe leader of Mecca. Feisal let him lead fifty men across the Nefud desert to perform his mission - taking Aqaba from the Turk's hands. On the way through, he united the two rival Arab factions of Prince Feisal(The Hariths) and Auda abu Tayi(The Howeitats). After successfully completing his mission, he became a Major in the army and continued to secure Arab co-operation with Britain by stopping the Turks from gaining the control of Suez Canal. While on a spying mission in Derra, Lawrence was caught and tortured by a Turkish officer. He was depressed and wanted to resign. Finally he changed his mind because he thought he should give freedom to his Arab friends. He conquered Damascus and united the nations under the Arabs. As a colonel, he set up the Arab Council at Damascus for Prince Feisel, and he eventually went home after he had dome all the jobs in Arabia. He died in the spring of 1935, while he was riding a motor-cycle powerful enough to fulfill his appetite for speed.",

The characters are believable, and likeable, and played by incredibly gifted actors. The scenery is superb, easily replacing ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" as my favorite ""desert"" movie. But most of all we aren't told what to think about T.E. Lawrence. After watching the film, I still don't know if he was a genius or a madman, a hero or a hack. It is 220 minutes long, but even though I had other, more urgent things to do, I could stop the film, I had to watch it in one sitting.

586,20 March 1999,ZEKE-18,10, The Epic Cinema at age 10,"My first large screen experience was Lawrence of Arabia.  At the age of 10 in the largest cinema in Detroit I sat in awe as the opening motorcycle scene left this young man dead.  This I could understand and relate to. The desert, the Arab culture and the prejudice of the English I could understand.  The politics eluded me, but the majesty and the splendor of the presentation had me hooked!  Many more cinematic escapades I pursued: when they re-vitalized (restoral it wasn't) Gone with the Wind and brought it out in 70mm for the first time, the first cinerama I saw was How the West was Won and then 2001.  But when they restored Lawrence, I went back and I understood it all.  The same goosebumps and cinema thrills of a 10 year old with the experience of adulthood brought the struggle and the commitment of Lawrence and his Arab bretheren to the forefront.  This was a documentary, perhaps innaccurate, but It in essence is a true story of an English gentleman giving up a life of luxury to free ""his"" people.  The dramatic license is used judiciously, with flair, and in the seductive setting that helped form the man, so be it.  In all the purpose of film is to escape and find yourself involved and intrigued.  Enjoyment is the name of the film game.  With the memories of childhood and the wisdom of age, the Lawrence epic is one of the greatest movies on record, worthy of a top ten.

We are cast back in time(more than 20 years) to Cairo, where Lawrence is about to begin the greatest adventure of his career: his commanding officer instructs him to liaise with Prince Feisel(Alec Guiness) of the Bedou people, in a bid to make an 'appraisal' of the fortunes of the Arab forces in the struggle against the Ottoman Turks. A concise summary of the movie would outline five key events: i)Lawrence's journey into Bedouin territory and his meetings with Feisel and Sherif Ali Ibn El Kharish (Omar Sharif) - Omar Sharif's entrance alone has become legend in the annals of movie history ii)The ardous trek across the Nefud Desert and subsequent attack on Aqaba iii)Lawrence's torture at the hands of the sadistic Turkish Bey in Deraa iv)The massacre at Tafas. v)The final success in Damascus.",

And, to an extent, Lawrence fits this bill-- few films can match it in the department of grandness. Yet the film is anything but simplistic in its approach to its characters and the themes they represent. Indeed, Peter O'Toole's Lawrence is surely one of the more complex and perplexing heroes to ever grace a movie screen. Just who is this man? What does he stand for and what makes him great?

However, I must declare that hearing the sprawling main theme becomes ad nausium as the film progresses, and takes away from the theme's impact and use.

The one item I find that is missing is the rape of Peter O'Toole by José Ferrer, where did this disappear to? In what uncut version of the movie does this sequence appear? I find this missing piece is necessary for what follows and it explains much. Would someone please post a list of what is included in what versions of each of the listed films. This is one of my #10 picks. Someone has stolen my Lawrence of Arabia (Single Disc Edition)! May a thousand flees infest that person. Other than the above the pan and scan versions should be ad voided. This film must be seen in it full widescreen edition. I hope this has been a little helpful and I look forward to someone giving a complete list of all known versions of this award winning film.",
609,21 February 2004,mainelyned,10, One of the finest movies ever!,"I saw ""Lawrence of Arabia"" when it opened in NYC and was simply swept away by it.  Seeing it on the big screen was an event in itself. Nothing has come close to this movie for the quality and richness of the production.  Back then there were no digital images or other techniques of today.  David Lean did it the ""old fashioned way"" and the effort shows.  Simply a great film!",
610,9 January 2000,Pudditat,10, One of my top 10 all time favorites.,"I absolutely loved this film the first time I saw it, and the many times I have watched it again and again.  It takes you away to a strange and bizarre world, and carries you on a fantastic, exciting journey.  It brings to life the war between the Arabs and the Turks, and even brings some understanding of the eternal conflicts in the Mideast.  Even more, it presents a fascinating look into the perplexing character of T.E. Lawrence.  O'Toole makes him more than any ordinary man, conveying him in an almost godlike manner.  The sound track and Lean's directing are superb.  Another example in a long line of films that truly do the English proud.",
611,9 February 2004,kenkao_09,10, My opinion after having watched the movie,"Is is magnificent, I think this is one of the movies that we won´t see again. Hollywood productions on the 50´s 60´s and almost 70´s were a high quality ones, they considered from the biggest to the smallest detail! and of course the casts were extremely well-chosen. Lawrence of Arabia is a great example of the Hollywood I miss deeply. Although I watched it at the first time in Spanish I almost felt what the director wanted to make on the audience: Feel the power of the story, the acting and the score! I think the score (made by Maurice Jarre) and the Director of photography have done a great job of course led by legendary David Lean and hardworking Sam Spiegel!",
612,21 December 1998,reuben-4,10, The best film,"The way that Lean fused together the portrait of a single man with the grandeur of his time and the events which he shaped is extraordinary and brilliant. The ideas in this film which are so fluently communicated are without compare in cinema. This is cinematic storytelling at its very best, where each of the film's elements work together to fulfill the goals of the narrative.",
613,12 May 2004,mikainen,9, Classic,"I have trouble understanding some of the earlier commentators who thought that this movie is boring. I had no trouble with its length although I did  have a break between disc 1 and 2 (DVD). Great acting, good story (and if that was how the real character died why should the movie-makers invent another one? some earlier commentator was arguing about that), beautiful scenes, and the film showed the ""hero's"" flaws too which made it very realistic. 9/10",
614,12 October 1999,Duffy-13,10, An absolute must-see,One of the greatest movies of all time.  Peter O'Toole does a masterful job portraying the controversial and just down right strange Major Lawrence. Omar Sharif also delivers a powerful performance as a man torn between two times.  Alec Guiness is almost over shadowed by their performances. ..almost but not quite.,
615,20 November 2007,xarraw,6, At 1960; Great. At 2007; OK.,This wasn't a bad movie. Though I like faster action and dialog I could watch it to the end. Scenes were from time to time boring and this film wouldn't get as good review if it was published today. Music was nice and once I had to stop watching movie to get inspiration to guitar-riffs ;). Acting was OK with these lines the actors we're given. I could get only some messy ideas of the actors feelings. Battles were cool with all those camels and horses running around.. lot's of money gone to shooting fer sure.,
616,2 November 2000,chateauxstudios,10, One of the world's finest films,"The combination of David Lean's epic directing and Einsensteinian editing, Maurice Jarre's landmark score and Peter O'Toole's distant, unnervingly maddening portrayal of this unusual hero for British, French, Arabs and Jews alike, has made it the classic we all know. Lean like Hitchcock was one of the few directors in this period to be able to combine the best of Hollywood and their British roots and be highly successful. Fortunately this seems to be improving for the future. A healthy respect of modern American Filmmakers or European film is beginning to open the door wide for all the rest of the world. Thanks to this, the likes of Peter Weir, Bruce Beresford, Roman Polanski, Ridley Scott, Wolfgang Petersen, Luc Besson etc are now having an impact on world cinema through Hollywood funded projects. Pity a DVD of this epic still doesn't exist.",

Lawrence of Arabia takes you to the big screen on 70mm.,
618,6 April 2001,Lewmor1110,10, David Lean's Grand Masterpiece!,"""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a work of a art. David Lean brilliantly directs this magnificent piece of visual excellence and molds it with a well-told story (screenplay by Robert Bolt). Freddie Young's capture of the beautiful desert makes this film a joy to watch, along with the music of Maurice Jarre that ties in perfectly with the concept of the film. But most of all, Peter O'Toole, in the role that made him not only a successful film star, but a legend among all movie-lovers. The way he blends in with the character of T.E. Lawrence is uncanny; he truly makes this film a joy to watch. I recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it but truly loves movies. Trust me, this one is a movie of the ages.",
619,20 August 2021,qdqqtrncq,10, Simply stunning,"There is so much good to say about this film. It is a true masterpiece of cinema. Everything about it is a part of the story including a real mirage, the wind in feisels tent and the British music in Cairo. What other movies introduces a sherif riding in on the waters of an authentic mirage?! Arabia herself is a character in this movie. The movie tells the story of love in a visceral way including how love can destroy a man.",
620,8 February 2002,vries42,10, One of the best historical action movies ever.,"In terms of cinematography, casting, music and script: a masterpiece. Breathtaking views of the desert. Several climaxes that are totally unforgettable: first view of the desert, the shooting of Lawrence's guide, the rescuing of the man who fell off his camel in the middle of the night, entrance into Auda's camp, return of Lawrence to the officer's mess in Cairo, slaughtering of the Turkish army. Perfect roles of Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quinn and Jose Ferrer. Strangely, there is not one single female role in the film, but somehow they are not missed.",
621,31 July 2003,popeyedoyle622,10, Why is this movie NEVER #1?,"On about every single list of the greatest movies of all time, Lawrence of Arabia always comes in second to Citizen Kane, or The Godfather, or Casablanca. All of them terrific movies, but none quite match up to this masterpiece. When taken into account the time period in which this movie was made, it's easy to see that Lawrence is far, far ahead of its time. Also, It warms my heart to see that Peter O'Toole has finally received an honorary oscar for this film (in case you're not familiar, he lost his 1962 Best Actor Oscar to Gregory Peck for ""To Kill a Mockingbird""). It's also amazing to me that this is O'Toole's first starring role, in which he did such a smashing job. I think that this is a greatly underappreciated flick, and we should see it on the list as #1 once in a while.",
622,29 September 2004,MrShedney,10, Luminous,"Was ever an actor more happily cast than Peter O'Toole as Lawrence? He seems to give off light, a neurotic angel swept by desert winds to glories he half-loves, half-despises. He's perfect as Lawrence, or rather one of many Lawrences - the mythic creature of Lean's imagination, perhaps as valid as a dozen other personas crafted in the web of T.E.'s tortuous self-recreation. (Incidentally, for a facial resemblance, compare T.E. with Stan Laurel.) Every line of dialogue is at least interesting, and often beautiful, in itself, but almost every line echoes, resonates, elsewhere in the film, or in our memories of Biblical, legendary and desert things. Beautiful, delicate, glittering, harsh - many truths can be told, and this lyrical vision adds colour to more prosaic accounts of the forging of the modern Middle East.",
623,8 May 2003,mosando79,10," Very good story, even a better film.","This movie might be 3 1/2 hours but its does not feel like it. All around great acting from Peter O'Toole to Anthony Quinn. The film has everything you need except love, but you dont need it in this film. Besides being a great film this is also a very good lesson in history of the middle east. This film I personally give it a 9 out of 10",
624,22 February 2019,mking10603,10, Best epic made,"The music is so moving in this epic and then it begins.
David Lean has the ability to capture on screen magic. He has a patience that most directors do not have and the ability to bring out the best in every actor.
O'Toole truly becomes the oddball and perhaps insane T.E. Lawrence with the directors help I am sure.
In watching this movie over and over again it was the beginning that brought me to tears.
In watching this movie and reading about T.E Lawrence it also made me think that if the powers that be had listened to him at the end of WWI the middle East would not still be in turmoil today.
This is movie perfection.",

Apart from it , its a good movie showing the great and noble culture of Arabian muslims, Anthony Quinn is great in it .The long duration of this film is one of its drawbacks.",
626,14 February 1999,OLCAY,9, excellent but historically untrue,"I have watched this film many times. Every time I watched I got very sad about the psychological analysis of the English Agent Lawrence. He is fond of Arabs, and he supports Sharif Hussein's rebellion against Ottoman Empire may be something as a Crusader's attitude. He is not a sadist and latent homosexual as mentioned in the film. In the cinema history Lawrence of Arabia should be mentioned as the main monument of David Lean. Charismatic Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif and Alec Guiness made the film excellent with their enormous acting. I am an admirer of the film even my grandfather has fought as an Ottoman Officer against Arab and English troops in the deserts.",

It was an old copy (non restoration, on video, but letterbox) yet something powerful made me stay up until 3:30am to watch the whole thing.  After that, I watched it about three more times on video.",
628,6 July 1999,henry-51,10, The Greatest Film Yet..Lean's Masterpiece,"In an era of box office giants and computer animation, it's good to know that films such as this one, were once made. The present day formula of ""animation and action"" mixed in with mindless screen-writing and assembly line acting, makes one yearn for the days when a film could be epical and yet enjoyable. What makes ""Lawrence of Arabia"" great is quite simple. The effort and endurance that was needed to film for three years, in a hostile and yet magnificent setting, is beyond the imagination of our present day era, of the ""quick"" studio release. This achievement alone, would make ""Lawrence"" one of the greatest ever made, but when one looks past all the visual accomplishments of the film, one sees the real reason it stands above the rest. The screenplay by Robert Bolt(Dr. Zhivago, The Mission) is well timed and presents a believable and yet mildly metaphorical dialogue. ""I can not speak for the place, only for myself"", Lawrence tells Ali, and we and Ali instantly believe him. The actors are all brilliantly cast, especially Omar Sharif and Claude Rains. O' Toole does a great job of making Lawrence seem as if he does indeed control his own destiny, and yet in every scene we see the vulnerability of Lawrence, and his insecurities. Excellently photographed, brilliantly written, and perfectly cast and acted, ""Lawrence of Arabia"", is a metaphor in itself for the landscapes upon which it was filmed. Flawless.",

631,23 August 2000,nevskyprospect,10," ""Appreciate the situation"": It is the best film ever!","What more can I say that I have not said in my heading? This film surpasses all other films, mainly in part for its superior screenplay and dialogue. The movie is loaded with various motiffs and symbols. The overall theme of the movie is the psychological transformation of T.E.Lawrence. The switch of personalities between Lawrence and Ali is all too apparent. Lawrence after all, suffers an identity crisis throughout the film. Lawrence first starts off as a humble soldier. Once he undergoes his mission to ""appreciate the situation"" he states that he will accomplish a ""miracle"" which he eventually does. From there he compares himself to Moses as he crosses Sinai. He eventually goes so far as to compare himself to Christ as he walks in splendor and transfigured white on top of the train. He shortly thereafter states that he will ""walk on water"". He however not only comes back down to earth, but he sinks to the bottom, covered with mud and filth after his rape by the Turks. He even goes so far as to cover himself with a filthy cloak. He however cannot cover the bloody scars on his back (this is about as close to Christ as he gets), which are a result of the Turks' torture.",

633,4 July 2002,amberbox,10, Landmark Epic,"A movie so good that I am careful to watch it only occasionally in order to preserve the 'newness' of the film in my mind.  If you have the chance to see this in a movie theatre, do it!  I can only think of a handful of movies that have successfully combined visuals, sound and story in such a rich and compelling way.  Performances from Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn are standouts.  Whenever I see an adventure movie today, I lament that epics like this are hardly ever attempted anymore, and when they are, directors and producers choose to substitute digital effects for storytelling.  Here is a movie without a single digital effect that is far more fascinating than either of the new Star Wars movies.  Director David Lean was a visionary man whose work will forever entertain audiences and inspire new filmmakers to greater and more challenging heights.  This cinephile is very grateful.",
634,9 December 2001,edsonquintanilha,10, One of the greatest masterpieces of all times,"Only David Lean could join together, so brilliant talented actors, and strong egos, to bring us, perhaps the greatest movie masterpiece of all times, Really unforgettable the Peter O'Toole performance[ it is hard to believe he was the second option for Lawrence's role], in his leading role, with some magic scenes and words, as said in the desert crossing: 'Nothing is written, unless you write on your mind'. I can't understand why O'Toole was not awarded with the American Oscar[ Gregory Peck should forgive me, since he is also a great actor, but in my view, not at the same level of O'Toole, mainly by comparing with this film]. Also the musical theme and photography , surely complete this entire masterpiece. To close my comments, to me, very few movies deserve a grade 10, and Lawrence of Arabia is ,for all reasons ,among them.",
