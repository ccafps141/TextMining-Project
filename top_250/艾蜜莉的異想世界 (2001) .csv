Some that come to mind include ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""American Beauty"" and ""Vertigo.""

You can add ""le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" to that list.",v
4,2 January 2003,mucronate,10, She makes ME fall in love too!,"To start off with, I heard a lot of good things about this movie when it was on the big screens but never got around to see it before it disappeared. Sitting here, long after in the aftermath, I might never forgive myself for missing that opportunity. Eventually I did get around to see it, though a small TV never does a film the same justice a theater does, and being a bit sceptic about the small hype this movie caused made me prejudice about it, but I must say I have never been so wrong before. And I am happy saying it.",i
5,20 July 2018,perica-43151,10, Hearthwarming,"This gem is one of the most memorable French movies of the new millennium. Amelie wears its heartwarming charm in best way possible. If you have not seen this movie, go and see it now.",e
6,27 March 2005,ztruk2001,10, Audrey Tautou is magical,"Amelie is a film that struck a certain chord with me. Every now and then movies come along that speak out to you and emotionally touch you in some way. Amelie is one such film for me. I related to its innocent charm and delightfully shy protagonist played by French sensation Audrey Tautou, the way very few films have. Part of the reason we watch movies is to learn something about ourselves or recognize characters that are remarkably similar to us and the way we are in real life. For all of us shy, introverted, quirky, and odd-ball eccentrics out there who have trouble relating to ""normal"" people, Audrey Tautou in this film is our personal hero. Instead of going into much detail about why the film works, I'll instead try to explain what it meant to me personally. Sure I guess this means I have to open up maybe more than I'd like to about myself, but oh well. The way Amelie's childhood was presented is similar to my own. I am an only child to divorced parents and very rarely had friends as I was and still am very much a loner. As a child much of my time was spent alone so I entertained myself in all kinds of silly ways. Just like Amelie does in the film. Of course I gained my fixation with films at an extremely early age, but also did stupid things like give my stuffed animals personalities and have conversations with them, draw pictures and create stories to go along with them, and laid in bed listening to the radio with the windows open on a lazy summer day imagining creatures out of the cloud formations. Apparently there are legions of us out there. Even today I enjoy solitude far more than the company of most people and still use my imagination to think of stupid little things. Amelie did an amazing job in capturing what the world is like through the eyes of a person who doesn't really fit in, but finds joy in the simple things in life. Like the fresh spring breeze on your face, the sound of the rain, the chirping of birds, the touch of fur, and popping bubble wrap. Actually popping bubble wrap was always an exciting and rare treat during my youth. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film also has a marvelously fun nifty view of sex. For Amelie sex is not something that is intimidating, temptingly desirable, sinful, adult, or lustful. It's just another of the many silly things that people do in this world that make us human. Two people taking off their cloths and rubbing up against one another. How sweet! In fact many people have insulted the film for it's unique view and open attitude towards sex. For shame really. Sure there's a lot of it actually. Amelie's first sexual encounter, the orgasms, the object of her affection working in a porn shop with a stripper and putting price tags on didoes. But it's all in good fun and filmed with the naivety that a character like Amelie would view sex as. Anyways the movie really works. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel does an excellent job in filming Jeunet's crazy vision and Audrey Tautou with her funky hairdo, wide brown eyes, and whimsical voice and kitten like mannerisms and shyness brings the movie to life. As I said I relate to this movie and understand the character the way I do with few other movies simply because it is frighteningly very much like I tend to be in real life. ",w
7,9 January 2017,Hitchcoc,10, She. Captivates Us All,"There seems to be a movement afoot to diminish ratings on films, even if they are reasonably good. So someone looks at the 250 best films list and rather than actually review and give any sort of subjective review, they give it a one so they can sabotage the rating. This is a charming movie. It's not for everyone, but it is creative and kind and has a wonderful love story. Criticize a away, but to call a person with a desire to do good, even if she invades the spaces of people, a psychopath! Really. I guess that's the curse of the public forum. For those actually interested in the movie, it involves a young woman who has been sheltered by her parents. When the mother is killed by a falling body, she is left to her own designs. Her father is cold and disinterested and she must fend for herself. She becomes an observer of life and begins to formulate her own being. Her decision making is based on her personal journey and, in some cases, a lack of real education. She is a waif but only wants to do good. One of the most creative and loving movies ever produced.",/

I slowly began to realize as I watched Amelie skip stones in the canal that for the very first time, a film deserved all of hype it had been accorded and more, and I felt so blessed to be a part of this revelation.",w

11,10 April 2009,claudio_carvalho,9, One of the Sweetest and Most Original Movies of Cinema History,"In 1974, in Enghien in the northern suburbs of Paris, the girl Amélie Poulain was born and raised alone by her cold hearted father and her stressed mother due to a mistake of her father's evaluation of her heart conditions. Her mother dies in a weird accident and when the shy and daydreamer Amélie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) becomes a young woman, she moves to central Paris and works as waitress in the café Deux Moulins in Montmartre. On 30 August 1997, Amélie finds a child treasure hidden behind the wall that belonged to a dweller from the 50's, and she decides to anonymously return it to the owner. He seeks out the man and when she witnesses his happiness, she decides to become the ""godmother of the rejected"", anonymously helping people that are her acquaintances using her fantasy and little tricks. She convinces her father to travel abroad using his garden gnome; she helps her neighbor that is an outcast and lonely painter and the super that misses her unfaithful husband; she also helps her hypochondriac colleague that works in the tobacco shop and the man that stalks the other waitress acting like cupid; she plays pranks to an employer that mistreats his employee with abusive relationship. When Amélie finds the album of photos of an intriguing collector that collects rejected photos in the Photomaton of the Gare de l'Est, she seeks him out and falls in love with him. On 28 September 1997, Amélie Poulain finds love.",6

15,16 January 2002,bopdog,7," Pleasant fluff, but WAY overrated!!!","There are no complaints when watching ""Amelie."" It is pleasant enough, and it even displays a bit of depth that is the hallmark of better romantic and ""feel good"" comedies. However--- it isn't a great movie. It is no masterpiece. The foppish poseurs who drool over this light fare as if there were beholding some amazing jewel is getting a bit annoying. In the artsy theater in our town, I could hear the forced and hollow ""salon chuckles"" of the local cognoscente wannabes, as if displaying to us all that they, too, ""get it."" Humbug! Those folks should get out more!",1
16,8 January 2003,smatysia,6, Quintessential quirky French cinema,"Amelie is the quirky main character, who seems to go on a binge of ""random acts of kindness"" except that they aren't so random, and some are kind of mean. It is reasonably enjoyable, and probably worth a rental. I cannot fathom its ranking, though. I think that films should maybe be a few years old before being eligible for the top films of all times lists, like the top 250. I looked through that list and there are some new films which will be utterly forgotten in 20 years. I fear that ""Amelie"" will be among them. Grade: C",0
17,17 November 2009,kenjha,4, Annoying,"A smug-faced Parisian pixie with a tenuous grasp of reality decides she is going to influence other people's lives whether they like it or not. Amelie has got to be one of the most annoying characters in recent cinema. She is mousy, meddlesome, mean, and manipulative - and these characteristics are supposed to make her lovable. The film operates under the concept that quirky equals charming. The narration is supposed to be cute and funny, but is grating instead. The plot rambles on pointlessly. The director repeatedly uses zooms and weird sound effects to convey some sort of whimsical film-making but manages to simply be distracting. It's unbelievable that this won an Oscar.",/

19,14 May 2020,Kdosda_Hegen,6, Very forgettable romance flick.,"I loved the style of it. This film is very colourful, the editing is interesting, the music and camera work is great.
For the story I'm not too fond. The protagonist girl is playing with other characters, to some she sets traps, to some she plays with their feelings and minds, to some he gives clues and mystery. It's all a game for her.
I wouldn't call this a romance movie at all, more like bland adventure movie.",r
20,28 December 2001,Chris Do,10, Psychologically insightful,"This movie is stylish beyond belief. But what strikes me most is the way it manages to capture the reality of human emotions, how internal monologues are played out in the form of TV programs, how dreams are simulated by the magical movements of inanimate objects and talking photographs! It is a charismatic portrayal of inner existence and the most natural desire to pursue happiness, both in our life and that of others.",e
21,15 November 2021,MK_Movie_Reviews,5, A stylish movie but the story was dull,"While watching this movie, I felt like watching an art gallery or interior magazine.

27,8 August 2002,dbdumonteil,1, she didn't and she won't change my life,"This movie is at number 14 in the top 250. It was nominated in several categories for the oscars by March 2002. All around the world, Amélie Poulain elated millions of people. The question I ask myself is this one: why did this film make millions of people so happy? I saw it last year at the cinema; it's not that I didn't like it, it left me indifferent and I watched it very carelessly. A naive girl whose name is Amélie Poulain discovers what her destiny is: make people happy. She'll succeed in before she falls in love with a man (Mathieu Kassovitz). I think it's a lacklustre and dull film. The screenplay isn't very entertaining and it looks as if there is no plot. The main thema of the movie, which is for Amélie to make people happy, is more sketched out than really explored. Moreover, the dialogues are vain and most of the characters are talking for nothing. Above all, several sides of the film didn't please me, especially its humor. The movie wants to be funny but according to me, the humor usually falls flat and sometimes it can fade into the heaviness like the love scene in the cafe. There is something that I don't like in the Amélie Poulain's character; I think she is dope, a bit dumb and she's got very odd thoughts ( how many couples will have an orgasm in the next second!!!). Besides, the actors aren't very great. I mean that they aren't very well defined. We learn what they like or don't like but for most of them, their tastes or hates are only tics (like Jamel Debbouze who cherishes fruits and vegetables because he's a greengrocer). On the other hand, some elements of the film are useless and barely bring interest to the movie, I think about Amélie's father who loves his garden gnome, or the old man who tries hard to reproduce Renoir's painting ""le déjeuner des canotiers"". To sum up: Amélie's destiny's got nothing fabulous and it's a film that lacks of poetry and is a speading of clever visuals and ringing brainwaves.",u

36,5 February 2023,I_Ailurophile,10, There are few truly perfect films in the world. This is one of them.,"Anyone who has previously seen a film of acclaimed French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet should not be at all surprised with the utterly resplendent, outstanding imagination that fills every moment of this one. What is surprising nonetheless is the absolute breadth and depth of that imagination, and its wit, charm, and warmth. Every last trace of 'Amélie' overflows with it, to the point that to run down a list of all the ways in which the pictures dazzles is essentially to break down how pictures get made. Jeunet's bewitching shot composition, and his keen orchestration of every scene; Bruno Delbonnel's enchanting, wonderfully dynamic cinematography, practically a living character unto itself; Hervé Schneid's impeccable editing; fantastic, colorful production design, art direction, and costume design; lovely hair and makeup work; fabulously whimsical characters, dialogue, and scene writing to build a quirky, off-beat narrative with equally whimsical humor; supremely nuanced performances to realize those ever so unique characters; seamless, fanciful, seamless effects both practical and special; Yann Tiersen's splendidly inviting, rich original music; flawless sound design...

37,26 May 2003,AnomyBC,1, Why do people like this movie???,"I hate to be one of those negative people, but I hate this movie with an incredible fiery passion. I think it's very possibly the most overrated film of all time. I watched it a while back expecting to see something amazing but I was disappointed beyond words. The main character is very possibly the most annoying movie creation of all time. She's really cutesy and pale and she doesn't say anything. She's like a cross between Shirley Temple and a mime. By the end of the movie you just want to reach into the screen and choke her. Beyond that, as far as I can tell, the movie has no point whatsoever. And just for record, I'm not just saying this because I'm an idiot American who can't appreciate French cinema--I actually love French films (my favs are The Girl On The Bridge, La Haine, and Leon: The Professional). But this one just makes me want to pull my hair out. Anyway, I'll certainly attempt to watch it again at some point and give it another chance, but so far I'm at a complete loss as to why this movie is ranked at #18.

I love his unique visual style that borders on surrealism with the stylised colour palette, the warm yellows and greens and the dreamlike tint, and I love his highly imaginative, complex schemes, those 'clockwork' or 'domino effect' sequences which are so characteristic of his films.

50,21 December 2001,canardo-1,1, A celebration of passive aggression.,"This movie is extremely static. It is a character study hitched to a romance. What is seen visually is more often than not an illustration for the voice over narration. It is very close to a book-on-tape. The title character is atrocious. She hasn't enough strength of character to confront a loud-mouth unless it is from the back of a crowd. Don Diego de la Vega could have risen to the challenge without donning his Zorro suit. I don't know when unlawful entry becomes burglary. None of the petty crimes she commits are ennobling or endearing. Amelie is a sad case, which makes the love story rather frightening.

""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" is not only a movie: it's a jewel of happiness, it's the glory of life, it's an amazing present for everybody, it's almost a necessity for the merriness and the peace of the world!...

Bruno Delbonnel's cinematography is very original: all the colors are in harmony each other and with the story and the characters... Ah the characters! How interesting and warm they are! And all of them are magnificently interpreted. What about Yann Tiersen's  poetic music?

61,31 January 2003,ColeSear,6," Great to a point, but slips (Spoilers)","Unlike Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Cité de enfants perdu which never has a period, or moment of greatness, Amélie manages to be great and wonderfully inventive for about the first half hour until Bretodeau gets his box back. After that it's as if we've watched the origin story of a super hero and then watch her go about her daily routine (changing from Clark Kent to Superman, so to speak). The film then hits a structural snag, whereas, now Amelie has satisfied the desire of one man she goes off and tries to help everyone almost at once and we are told of these incidents simultaneously. The film had its greatest grip on me when we were focused on one story, there would've been nothing wrong with vignettes after all it was good enough for Truffaut in Small Change. 	Amelie begins wonderfully, with voice-over narration of her early life which the French seem to be masters at, the best example of voice-over being in Leolo a Quebecois film. Her childhood full of its strange events come across as hilarious whereas other cultures might have botched them making them distasteful, the death of her mother being a perfect example. The quirky humor is about the only thing that never leaves the film from the ticket taker who now punches holes in plants, the stuffed dog, the traveling gnome etc. When Bredoteau finds his box we flashback to what memories those items held for him in what are truly beautiful moments of the film. This is my moment of highest involvement, that sequence was a pinnacle which the narrative never achieved again. 	Part of the problem is the predictability the film later runs into. I'm terrible at guessing the ends of movie but once we were introduced to Nino and told of his past I knew that he and Amelie would end up together. So obviously, it was nerve-wracking and annoying that she was so painfully shy and prolonged the movie unnecessarily. Then there's the almost American complication in the relationship between Georgette and the bar drunk by her talking to Nino were so uncalled for. Then we also have the ""Glass Man"" and Amelie pondering Renoir's painting. While in the beginning it's commenting on Amelie is subtle it becomes more and more overt as the film moves on. The there are Jeunet's shots of Amelie smiling to extract her cuteness for some affect and frankly she's not all that cute and the shots are inorganic which is even worse. The special effects also eventually become pedantic when the key in her pocket shines, it makes me wonder what kind of film this would've turned into if Jeunet had been given a Lucas-like amount of special effect allowances in the budget. 	The cinematography in this film is quite spectacular but in certain instances the effects downplay what they have been able to do with the camera. The change in structure of this film ultimately creates a domino effect. While I can't re-write the film I wonder if I would be nit-picking so much if there hadn't been such a shift in the way the story was told. In the end Amelie is an enjoyable experience that may just have indulged its premise a bit too much-6/10.",

The only reason I say that it is more down to Earth is simply because it is set in modern Paris, and the events are a little more realistic and believable (with the exception of Amelie's mother dying when somebody decides to jump off of the Notre Dame and just happens to land on top of her).",

However, these qualities are ideal for its theme of finding magic in the smallest aspects of everyday life. The plot may be playful, but it's grounded by tragic backstories. There is an impenetrable innocence in Amelie and its protagonist, but that merely coats an undertone of sadness. Deep down, Amelie is lonely and strives to make others happy to find her own fulfillment. Therefore, when Amelie is closely examined, it is actually quite bittersweet and her journey towards self-care is rather cathartic.",

Jean-Pierre made this film colorful like only few other people did or could do. Paris looks absolute dreamy and it makes you wish you were born in Paris, in Montmartre, with french as your mother tongue. It makes you wanna do something beautiful with your life, to yourself and to others, of course. It makes you brave, although you think of yourself to be the worst coward ever to live on this planet.

What with all the psychotic behavior and the annoying, creepy smiles Amélie cracks from time to time while she's trying to be cryptic and heroic, this film is easily one of the worst I've seen. The worst part is when people go on trying to defend it, saying that the character is simply misunderstood and that since the film is french, it offers a different perspective. Do we have to remind people that foreign films also have the ability to suck as much as American films? And I tried to give this movie a chance but the more I tried, the easier it was to find things that I didn't like about it.

It turned out to be a pleasant, pretty damned good movie.  It's certainly better than ""City of Lost Children"" (if not ""Delicatessen"").  Without the contribution of Jeunet's former co-director (and inspired production designer) Marc Caro, it doesn't LOOK nearly as good as it ought: too many sets and effects are merely digital (the single worst digital effect: at one point, when Amélie is excited, we pan down to a revolting X-ray image of her beating heart), only a third of the cutaway gags have anything going for them, and every single shot has an unattractive yellow colour cast - doubtless an attempt to capture the warmth of old Technicolor prints, but all it does the film look sallow.

It's the movie about the search for happiness, about small things, about dreams tucked neatly under the surface of reality which want out, also a training video for wanna-be mortal angels: Amélie is the ultimate reminder of carpe diem, to seize the day and play an active role in the fortune of others and one's self, providing instructions on how to glue together broken personalities.

But she's always one step removed from human contact -- communicating through pictures, metaphors, trinkets, one-sided phone calls, secret manipulations, windows and spyglasses. She's not exactly shy or anti-social or awkward.

The first ten minutes are pleasant enough, but dismay sets in when one realizes that the smirks are going to continue for almost two hours more. Perhaps I was expecting too much, given the reviews this film has received. But - people - there is no content here, only style. And the style gets old very quickly. I'm a great fan of romantic comedies, but Amelie doesn't even fit that genre well. The few plot twists (for example, the traveling gnome) are not set up well, leaving the viewer wondering what is going on, rather than being a participant in a delicious secret. Romantic comedy should involve several intertwining plots, which the viewer is aware of but the characters are not, with the plot 'intersections' generating sparks that can be both anticipated and savored by the audience. 'Sliding Doors', which I happened to see shortly after 'Amelie', was so superior in this respect that I cannot understand the higher regard in which the latter seems to be held. 'Amelie' is strictly linear; there are side-stories, but they involve no surprises and they have absolutely no impact on the main story. (I suppose the resolution of the traveling gnome mystery and the nature of the repeating photo-booth customer could be regarded as minor surprises, but they were revealed in a strictly linear way, and had no impact on the main story line). Rated at 5, and only that high because it's technically well done, and Audrey Tautou is indeed cute.",

Fortunately, our main character is simply wonderful and impossible to hate. The first half of this film is about Amélie trying to help people, and the second half is her playing mind games with a guy she has a serious crush on.

She does it while being decently interesting and quirkily funny. The better half of the film is the romance part, as I found it to be both more sweet and more funny. The whole time this guy is trying to find out who is playing these mind games with him, and when they finally meet, you get this feeling of satisfaction.

It gets a little scattered at times but its quirkiness is always heart-warming, and the scenes in Paris are a bonus. Offsetting some of the sweetness are the title character's pranks against a mean produce man because he abuses his brother, the object of her desire working in a sex shop, practically yawning as he helps put dildos on the shelf, and the two people she sets up in the café not working out because of the guy's creepy obsessiveness.

The simple, undeniable truth of this film IS the only simple, undeniable truth: that of human emotion.  Amelie is a person unable to separate how she feels about the world from how she interacts with it.  This translates into behavior which is often brave, sometimes crazy, and always lovable.  In this sense, then, Amelie is not a superhuman or a saint (for she is also painfully aware of her shortcomings and petty vanities), but a person who has the courage to actually be herself and let her emotions, no matter how fanciful or ""unrealistic"" they may be, shape her world and the world of the others around her.

143,1 January 2008,robert-temple-1,10, The Perfect Rendering of Imagination as Reality,"What can anybody say about this magical film which has not already been said? I saw it again and decided there are some things. This film has deep roots in a rich tradition of reality-as-imagination, as portrayed in French literature and poetry. It evokes the 'impossibile realities' of Andre Breton's romantic surrealist novel 'Nadja', together with its love of the mystery of certain Paris locations. As so much of the film takes place at the Gare de l'Est, which was the favourite haunt of the unique poet and writer of 'glimpses', Leon-Paul Fargue, the film draws much from his eccentric imaginative tradition too. And as anyone knows who has read the magnificent 27 volume novel 'Men of Good Will' by Jules Romains, as I have, that tale recounts the communication between two young lovers by means of signs and messages posted in public places, just as we see in this film. Whether Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the director, is aware of these things consciously in the way that he must be of the many cinematic references he makes, I have no way of knowing. But these things are in the blood and the bone of every Parisian. And although he is a Loire man, Jeunet is a Parisian now. As for the raids which Audrey Tatou makes on Collignon's flat in the film, these are a standard Surrealist activity. I knew well the 'last of the British Surrealists', David Gascoyne (an intimate of Paul Eluard and friend of Breton), as well as his friend Kathleen Raine, a British poetess. Kathleen told me that one time when David was upset with her, he broke into her house in Chelsea and 'staged a Surrealist raid on her home'. He turned all of her furniture upside down and left, - a clear precursor to Audrey Tatou! You breathe these things in the air of Paris, and if you have read any 20th century French literature, these things leap out at you and grab you by your solar plexus until you turn into a Jean-Pierre Jeunet. This film is perfect, everyone in it is perfect, everything about it is perfect, and I won't hear a word or whisper of criticism of it from anyone who doesn't wish a Surrealist raid on his home made in retaliation. Long live the Imagination Liberation Front! Down with the forces of mediocrity and drabness! May there be magic everywhere! And thank you, 'little elf with big eyes like a deer', and thank you, garden gnome who travels the world, and thank you Jeunet, you mischievous fellow and all who sailed in you!",

It is so disjunct, slow-paced and boring I fell asleep towards the end and I didn't even realize I had missed over ten minutes. Amélie as a character looks really obnoxious with that self-absorbed smirk plastered on her face, and her gamine hair style is hardly apt. She just keeps going around manipulating people's lives in a far-fetched and annoying manner, and to cap it all, her elusiveness through the cat-and-mouse encounters with her love interest is disappointing, intimidating and unnerving.

It is a film of little things that make life magical when they are noticed. Amèlie takes on the role of trickster fairy, ensuring that those moments are noticed by even the most oblivious. She brings herself fulfillment through her good deeds to others, and yet, along the way it becomes clear that these acts are her way of running away from herself, avoiding the advancement of her own story.

There was all this hype about a great, funny, quirky French film that was sweeping the nation, and so that's what I expected it to be. In reality, it was painfully formulaic in places and not nearly so delightfully quirky as, say for example, making your bed while listening to music from The Matrix.

Filled with emotive, beauty, colour, flavor, harmony and magic, this is one of the best films ever. Original, soft, happy, emotional and sweet, Amelie is the story of a young girl named Amelie. Her life is dramatically changes when she finds a toy box. She fined who is the owner, and magically gives it to him. The owner's life is changed and becomes happy and decides to change the course of his life. Amelie, happy of helping that man, decides to help humanity re-gain happiness and joy. Unfortunately she'll fall in love in the process. This masterpiece is smartly decorated with beautiful sets, unbelievable cinematography (which portraits Paris, one of the most beautiful cities), charming music and original and sharp dialogues.

Unlikely films such as Requiem for a dream, this film talks about humanity but in a nice, soft and tranquil way filled and decorated with beauty.

I really cannot think of a thing about this movie that I do not like. I think it has some of the most clever writing and one of the most effective character development devices. The quick two sentences about the person really gave a lot of flavor to the characters. I loved all of the acting and in particular the father really stands out in my mind. He is one of the funniest characters and is just fun. Amelie's personality is perfect and no one else could have pulled off the role. I totally fell in love with her the first time she looked in the camera and smiled. I liked the use of special effects and while most movies of this flavor it would look tacky it works so well. It almost reminds of Scrubs the way the fantasies play a role in the movie as a character development device and the writers of Scrubs must have watched this movie a lot. I love watching it again and again because each time I discover something new and every time that makes me smile. There is not much to say other than I love this movie and the reasons are obvious as soon as you watch it.",
192,10 January 2002,mroman,10," A rare gift of a movie, appealing to our appreciative, childish selves","Watching Amelie was for me like standing by a kindred spirit. It was so refreshing to watch the escapades and be able to identify with someone who appreciates the small things, is a small light of sensitivity and innocent good will, but also a lively and enthusiastic spark, a creative bringer of joy (and occasionally retribution) to others.  The scene of Bretodeau's reunion with his childhood treasure box was priceless.  As was Amelie's standing alone in the train station, having missed her chance to connect with Nino, or her melting into a flood of water, when Nino leaves the restaurant.  Or her walking the blind man across the street and flooding him with sensations of the marketplace. Or her imagined arrival of Nino prior to the moving bead curtain, .... Ah, such magic moments of moviedom.  Even to see one such moment in a movie is a fine thing, but Amelie had so many. Also, the many secondary characters all came alive as one could sense their stories and life's paths, that they had suffered, but could smile still.  Little joys amidst hurts. Overall, a finer movie experience is hard to find. Amelie has an innovative script, beautiful cinematography, lots of silliness, heartfelt yearnings, and love finally found between people you can actually like and care for.  And its a movie that seems to laugh at itself, too.  :^)   Bravo! Magnifique!",

At least I never paid good money to see it at the movies (it was on Cable TV but I wasted my time)!!,
195,1 May 2020,Tralequang,10, A lovely experience,"It is undeniable that Amelie radiates positive energy. It is one of the few movies that I smile feeling happy while watching.
The movie centers on Amelie, with a few subplots, all revolving around the theme of love and happiness. Amelie has a good heart; she cares for people's feelings and proactively helps them without their awareness. Amelie can love, and when she does, she tries her best to get the response she seeks. The plot is thus simple and easy to follow, with no twist and little suspense.
What captivates the audience is the feel-good vibe felt throughout the whole movie. This is achieved by excellent cinematography, good music, and a superb performance by Audrey Tautou. It is impossible to ignore the lovely way Amelie behaves herself, and it is quite hard to capture all her charm in words. My humble description stays at her cute look, her happy little smiles when seeing others' happiness, and her adorable uncertainty facing the love of her life.
What a wholesome movie. Amelie makes me wanna fall in love.",

198,22 November 2001,vivalarsx,9, What a joy!,"I saw this movie last night, and I don't think my feet have yet touched the ground!  What a silly, sweet, rueful little comedy--little used here affectionately, of course.  This is a film for anyone who has ever felt lonely, unloved, afraid to live.  Amelie helps so many around her, yet she seems unwilling (not unable) to help herself; it took me awhile to realize the depth of her fear.  For such a lighthearted movie to touch on so powerful an emotion reveals that ""Amelie"" isn't quite so simple as it initially seems.  Audrey Tautou is so physically perfect for the role, that she wouldn't even have to act--luckily for us, she knows how to turn hesitancy and slyness into a comic art form.  And Mathieu Kassovitz (grrr!) finds just the right tone; everything we hear about Nino from others is there, but he allows us to see much more than he lets others see.  They are a perfect match, and the joy in the movie is watching them pursue, back away, go forward, stumble away out of fear of contact. And the squeaky-clean faux-city the director creates is the perfect rarefied atmosphere for this little tale (in fact I find the movie fails only when it goes back to the country--the subplot involving Amelie's father and a ceramic gnome is an old joke, not deftly handled).  This is a keeper.  Go to see it if you're down; heck, go see it even if you are happy--it will merely lift you higher!",

A sweet story that shows us just how much the little things matter. A sweet and charming tale that leaves you satisfied, happy and longing for more.

When she is struck and static with her purpose in life she energetically moved forward to make others happy. And she finds that it is her life's purpose. Jeunet made a brilliant, quirky one along with his screenwriter Guillaume Laurant. The movie is so speedy because we can find unconventional shots and frames everywhere. It also broke the theory, where Godard did on his films and that is talking and dealing with the audience directly. Amelie looks at the camera and made her gestures in order to communicate with the audience directly. There is beauty everywhere not only in mise-en-scene but also in the technical aspect. The background score is so astonishing and the production design feels more vivid in its context and the viewers get the feeling that they are watching something fantasy. More than that Audrey Tautou's handling as Amelie is so brilliant with the aid of her hairstyle and the outfit.

There was a few times in the film that I had to replay parts because I was so enthralled by what was going on screen that I could not keep up with the subtitles as a result of me watching the film instead of reading.

It's a kind of neo-fairytale or modern storybook romance, heightened to such with its narration and its wonderful score by Yann Tiersen, simple and melodic, like a small band playing in a cafè on a sunny afternoon. It delves more than slightly into fantasy, as romance often does, but does so in a very refreshing and fun way. This is a world where gnomes travel and skeletons are somewhat sensual.

Amélie (the weird looking, but quite attractive BAFTA nominated Audrey Tautou) is a lonely young girl who discovers a secret box in her house, and after returning it to the owner and touching him, she becomes a do-gooder. The main reason this is a good foreign film is the good use of French jokes and the sex comedy like format. For me, it is like a French version of American Pie crossed with When Harry Met Sally. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Foreign Language Film, it won the BAFTAs for Best Production Design and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Yann Tiersen, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, the David Lean Award for Direction for Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Alien: Resurrection), Best Film and Best Film not in the English Language, it was nominated the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.

I was constantly in awe of the imagery more than anything, from the tiniest details on up, it was a carefully crafted film.  I spent a lot of the film laughing out loud...and occasionally I even found myself choked up.  It was a remarkable movie experience for me.  It makes other attempts at magical realism or fantasy sequences (such as Ally McBeal, for example) look like utter vomit. ",

Her world is full of vibrant colors, destined chances, risky safe zones, and seemingly altruistic values. Due to a lack of parental love when she was a child (which otherwise would have boosted her self-worth and joy), Amelie resorts to her imagination to escape from the harsh realities that surround her (i.e. her mother dying in a suicidal freak accident; her airy father being completely oblivious to her needs). Reality often disappoints whereas her imagination does not. From taking pictures of cloudy teddy bears in the sky, to watching people's reactions in a movie theater, Amelie's imagination carries her into adulthood to find what she most desires: love.",

A story about a person doing good for the people around her with elements of fantasy and a love story at its center. This manipulations of Amelie are reminiscent of Hitchcocks ""Rear Window"" although it's teeming with originality too. It's a mix of pleasant & ingratiating ideas. The pleasant ones are the reason to see it. The ingratiating ones border on the twee and sophomoric. I could have found half an hour to delete. For 'pleasant' it's a very hard sell. At a certain point you feel like Jeunet would strangle you if it made you like him more. I admire this movie more than I enjoy it. The cat and mouse things is a bit precious and goes on a bit too long.

It has acquired a reputation as being among the most charming and inspiring films ever. That is overselling things quite a bit. Yes, the movie has its charms. It will probably leave you with a smile on your face. But the truth is it's just a cute little film, a pleasant diversion but really nothing more than that. Audrey Tautou does an excellent job in portraying the title character, it's easy to fall in love with Amélie Poulain. But this young woman will frustrate you too. She sets out to do good, to bring happiness to others. That's nice. But she goes about it in such a roundabout way, nothing is ever straightforward. At times you really do wish the character, and the film, would just get on with it. Amélie doing things in her own very unique way is what gives the film much of its charm. But there comes a point where it's all a bit much.",

Charming and whimsical, it invokes a feeling of joy for finding the good in our lives. Make sure you have all that you need and don't drink too much prior to this film, because if you miss one part of this film you will inevitably miss a joke or punchline later in the movie. The mastery of Amelie is that nearly all the characters has just the right amount of character development, giving us enough insight into their lives to make each plot development poignant and fun. There are a lot of fantastical scenes where reality is bent a little, but I think most people have had the same kinds of thoughts and seen the same hallucinations at one point in their lives. Audrey Tatou is gourgeous and endearing at the same time with a grin that can't help but make you laugh. The payoff for this movie comes right near the end, and you feel every bit of emotion that can be wrung from it.

Years later, after finding a past tenants treasure, Amelie decides to become a regular do gooder. However, we wonder if she will ever have the time to please herself, and if she will ever be able to tell the love of her life how she feels.

This is a film that will touch you emotionally, it will make you laugh, cry, and most importantly; think about the fundamentals of life. Visually, this movie is breathtaking. Acting wise, the characters are so well executed, and the characters are so real, that is impossible for you not to relate to them on some level.

Amelie is raised in a strict household but has an active fantasy life. She was home schooled due to what her parents believed was a heart condition when in fact, it sped up when around her father who is a doctor. She works at a café but inspired to do good to others. She hunts down the owner of toys she found hidden. She observes a video store clerk who collects photos out of photo booths. She brings together a waitress and an irate customer, as well as befriends an elderly artist with a condition. Original with lush style and intriguing images. Refreshing triumph for Jean-Pierre Jeunet who previously made the wretched Alien: Resurrection. Audrey Tautou is delightful and charming as Amelie whose imagination is visualized through exquisite imagery. Mathieu Kassovitz collects photos at photo booths and is the object of intrigue by Amelie. Rufus plays Amelie's widowed father who is confused with regards to photos of a missing ceramic figure. Serge Merlin plays a painter with brittle bones who observes Amelie's need for companionship. Dominique Pinon steals scenes as a jealous ex-boyfriend who records conversations and bursts bubble wrap.

I loved Isabelle Nanty who plays hypochondriac tobacconist Georgette. She's a brilliant actress herself comically. This comedic, light-hearted and serious film at times is quite enjoyable to watch. I love the Parisian sites like Sacre Couer and Montmartre as well. Amelie tries to make lives better for those around her around the time of Princess Diana's tragic death. She wants and she dreams about being appreciated for all those good things. Amelie's childhood wasn't a happy one. She didn't have playmates.

It opens by defining the characters that surround our protagonist Amélie Poulain (the uniquely beautiful Audrey Tautou) by their strangest, most peculiar quirks; one character gets deep enjoyment out of using his fingers to elaborately dissect the hot carcus of a turkey and another character's greatest pleasure is emptying our her purse just to put everything back again. In the grand scheme, these quirks are fairly minor, but the fact that these are the traits screenwriter Guillaume Laurant wants us to immediately associate these characters with - not a job, a specific education, a personality trait, or a personal history - is, in itself, a tad subversive.",

The colour correction is really cool, and every time Amelie continues her scavenger hunt type quest to make peoples life better it's really cool. All the characters have some sort of quirk and their respective actors play them quite well. Amelie herself is played brilliantly considering most of the performance has to be non-verbal.

305,28 April 2020,zeekwunlau,9, Her world,"There are many touching pictures in this movie. What impressed me was when Dominique walked into the telephone hall when he heard the phone ring and saw the scene behind the tin box next to the phone. It is undeniable that personnel changes and years of washing have the ability to make people forget to forget. As the movie lens turns to Emily hiding in the dark and watching carefully, I will also worry about whether Emily has found the right owner, Dominic Will he forget the childhood treasures, will he put it back in disdain ... As the camera slowly approaches Dominic's face, he slowly lifts the photo, takes out the model of the little biker, his eyes move, his eyes look When fluctuating, I know that Emily's efforts are best explained.
Admittedly, Emily's kindness and perseverance are admirable. What moved me more was that Dominique's tears when he saw his childhood collection. The middle-aged man walked into the slow-moving camera calmly. From his gray hair, tight eyebrows, and serious face, he could see that he had experienced the vicissitudes, had experienced the time, and the world had changed. Weary and heavy-hearted, but when we face the childhood treasure, we know that he still has the young man, the young self, the excited him, to drink to commemorate, his temples are like a cloud, like Waves, he and Emily's eyes burst into joy.
Maybe angels have this intention to send surprises to others, or maybe Emily would like to observe people's reactions.
Another detail that touched me is the contact between the two angels. When Nino followed the arrow signal Emily left him, he looked down and saw the arrow formed by Emily using pigeon bait, and he smiled knowingly when he looked up. Both of them like to observe and pay attention to observation. Nino can glue the pieces of the torn photos one by one, and no one can lie on the ground enough to help the broken photos under the camera cabinet. Similarly, Emily will observe Nino in detail, just as she observes the world in detail.
Because most of the shots of the entire movie are showing the world in Emily's eyes, from childhood playmates to hanging pictures and table lamps that can talk in youth, they are actually things in Emily's world. Is it fantasy? Is it difficult to understand? Who can deny that he had no illusions in his childhood, and who can force imagination to belong only to children? It is our own deprivation of this ability that gives life to surrounding things. Emily lives in her own world, but she will also quietly walk into the world of others to punish evil and reward good. If it is difficult to understand, it is actually because we have difficulty entering Emily's world.
In his childhood, he hoped his father would hug him. Without friends of the same age, Emily would find fun in her life, change coins, draw pictures, and eat strawberries. In her childhood, she witnessed her mother's death because she was hit by a person who fell off the building. Her father escaped into her own world. Emily was still growing up, still kind, imaginative, and smiling. Konggu has Youlan, which is not a fairy pond. Even if there is no warm Yang Fu, Ting Ting Fang years.
Is n't everyone in their own world? You and I are either on the streets of the cross, or in the fields and the countryside, looking at the same sky, not all clouds will be born in the heart, and not all will rain, but who will not try to interpret the world, How about turning it into a habitat for your life?",

A soft light, a scent in the air, the quiet murmur of the city. A surge of love, an urge to help mankind overcomes her.¨ I didn't fall in love with Amelie in the same way many critics did, but I did enjoy this wonderful and uplifting movie powered by an interesting script and a great performance from Audrey Tautou. The cinematography is pretty breathtaking as well as it uses a lot of color (green, yellow, and red are predominant) giving the movie the fantastic touch it conveys. This French film was written and directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet who had previously worked in the Alien sequel, Alien Resurrection. This is a much better film. It has some great moments of humor, some mysteries that are solved along the way, and several romantic moments. It is a strange movie, but it works and ends up being uplifting. The narration in this film reminded me a lot of Y Tu Mama Tambien, where you had the narrator explain certain events that were happening at the time that didn't have anything to do with the story. The film was nominated for 5 Oscars in 2002 despite not winning any, but it did win a lot of recognition from international audiences. The movie takes place in Paris and that alone is a plus with such great scenery, and it also has a lot of energy that transcends the screen. It's hard not to like this small movie.",

333,7 July 2006,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8," Charming... but I don't think I ""got"" it","After hearing so many wildly positive comments on this film, I decided to watch it... and when I found it on the bargain rack(we aren't quite as clever with sales rhymes here in Denmark), I bought it. While the film captured me immediately with its unique style and the interesting, amusing story-telling, I found myself lost in the plot and the various actions of the characters. This was more noticeable in the latter half. Maybe it's a cultural difference, I don't know(it may also be because this isn't meant to be understood or analyzed... something I have a tendency to subject all things in life to). The main reason I watched this(positive feedback sounds good, but I've never been one to follow popular opinion) is that I'm interested in the work of the director... Jean-Pierre Jeunet. So far, I've only seen Alien: Resurrection, but I've heard fabulous things about Delicatessen from a man whose opinion I hold a great deal of trust and respect for, in particular when it comes to movies. Jeunet has a peculiar style and an unusual(occasionally bordering on the downright bizarre)sense of humor. The film clearly doesn't take place in our world... the line between the real and that which is fantasy is blurred to the point in which it doesn't exist. Normally, I'm not interested in fairy tales(and that may very well be the reason why I didn't get this film), but I found this quite charming. Everything is pretty and has a magical reason behind it. The comedy in the film is also extraordinary... it's so human, so light and delightful. Nothing crude, never offensive(except for, I suppose, to puritans) and somehow sweet. Like the naive little girl the film revolves around. I didn't quite agree with all the actions Ms. Poulain took in effort to uphold justice, but I am known to have(or attempt to have) a soft spot for most anyone, no matter their actions. As I hinted at before, the film is more... shall we say ""free"" than, for example, American films. The limits for what can be shown are looser, for better or for worse. Personally, I wasn't bothered by it, but if you think you might be, you may wish to skip this one. Most everyone who can watch this should, however... it is a welcome trip back to one's childhood, with the imaginative visuals and soft, light tone. Now, to anyone who doesn't speak French(including yours truly), you must view this with subtitles(I haven't heard of a dubbed version, and I personally find the idea of dubbing any movie appalling, unless it is a children's film and to be viewed only by children or people who haven't been blessed with the schooling necessary to be able to read; you should show the filmmakers the respect of viewing their work as they intended it). Personally, being Danish(I read once that we in this country have had just about everything subbed since some time in the early decades of the previous century), I'm not only entirely used to it, I have no problem with it(though with films like this and Der Untergang(and of course the works of Alejandro Amenábar), one is reminded to read them, as I cannot understand much of anything spoken; quite different than the case is with all works in the English language, where I only read on occasion, and often simply to pick out mistakes made by the Danish-born(and often linguistically incompetent) translators). People from other countries may experience difficulty at getting used to it, however. The cinematography is stunning beyond words. Acting, editing, score... basically everything seemed flawless to me. Apart from not understanding much of what goes on for the last part of the film, I enjoyed this. I recommend it to anyone who can watch a fun, light film with a great imagination. And if nudity or sexual content bothers you, you may want to ask someone who knows you and the film to either detail it or to estimate whether or not you can handle it. 8/10",

Instead, the story attempts to show the importance of triviality and the insignificance of ""world events""  I love the way the story was loosely framed around the Lady Di tragedy.

This film is about escaping the isolated voyeuristic world that we live for and begin to live our own lives, rich with our like and dislikes, or fetishes and quirks.

Every wickedly sweet smile directly at the camera, every little skip in her step after a good deed, the nervous apprehension before the wordless final consummation. It's altogether not too sad; despite not making many genuine connections she finds solace in the little things, and when a fateful TV broadcast of a royal figure appears, her life is turned upside down. She begins a series of little acts of goodness; returning a long lost box of boy heirlooms, punishing the abusive grocery store owner, writing fake long lost love letters, and my personal favourite, leading a blind man across and through the streets of picturesque Paris, with a lively and colourful narration.

349,5 November 2008,hbdave_77,10, A Beautiful Movie of the Lifetime,Have you ever realized that simple joys & pleasures of life lie in trivial details of human beings & not in any mundane thing of worldly pleasure or belongings. Can you believe one person can change your life? Welcome to the innocent & simple life of Amelie. Amelie is not only wonderful film but also amazing character played with such an ease & by Audrey Tautau. Amelie is a cute girl & a waitress living in Paris who loves helping people around her with her own innocent sense of justice & gradually she discovers the love of her life. Its wonderful journey of her life in which she transforms the lives of others but also her own. Amelie is the most wonderful & loving female character on screen I have ever seen till day. While watching I can't stop falling in love with her character & am sure its experience for all those who had already watched it. This is one of the films which will change your life. Watch this beautifully made film (if you haven't) & you will absolutely agree with what I m saying. Simply a Masterpiece of French Cinema.,

It's colors and just at the edge of your imagination special effects, were just that... special. You felt like you were in the expansive mind of this amazing woman. At no time did I feel my intelligence was insulted, it just kept me with a wistful smile painted on my face. My gaze never left this world that was created. I was only aware of the subtitles for about 5 minutes in the beginning. I really would have never guessed that this movie was directed by the same man who turned out the bile that was Alien Resurrection. But I have gained new respect for the man. This movie has easily made it just about at the top of my 2001 list of greatest films. It is certainly one of the finest foreign films I have seen and it makes me want to run out and see it again as if this were opening day of Star Wars or something. In other words, it was a beautiful movie. Brilliant.",
351,22 August 2002,gbheron,9, A Perfect Date Movie Amélie,"""Amélie"" is the perfect date movie. Or at least my perception of what a date movie should be.  Date movies, especially first-date movies, should be light-hearted romances. Nothing too serious, but not fluff either. ""Amélie"" strikes just the right balance between a light-hearted trifle and a film requiring some thought. Life is not a bed of roses for the title character, but there is no grimness, no depression. ",

Actually my taste in music composition was strongly influenced by this film. The way you see the world according Amelie's how it should all look and above all the little details that begin a work and lead to a unique history and to never forget. Let's talk about color, strong hue of green and red, two basic contrasting colors; matching all along story, the special treatment given to the tonality, lighting match with the whole concept of the mind of Amelie, Amelie world that is different from what appears but is simply a way of seeing life.

It is actually a pretty film, with an excellent style. Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a good director and the film is not boring at all. However, is it a ""wonderful film"" as some say?  I do not think so.  The actors are (of course) good, but Jeunet shows us Paris as a marvelous place. And yet, I know what Paris is like, since I live in that city.  And I can say that it is not the same thing at all.  I do not say to jeunet to be realistic (and anyway he could not be realistic), but just to be fair with this place, which is not a real wonder.",

357,27 September 2007,poe426,8," ""Even artichokes have hearts...""","AMELIE is not a staid CineMall movie but a quirky-plus unreality check- which was to be expected, coming as it does from the director who gave us both DELICATESSEN and THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN (both way over the top where AMELIE is an ephemeral fantasy). The amiable Amelie's theory that a dead man is leaving his photo all over town so as not to be forgotten is only the beginning. The ever-evolving story plunges full speed ahead and the cinematography (which is beautiful, by the way, as it is in the aforementioned ""eccentric cinema"" classics) carries the viewer along like a roller-coaster gone haywire. The performances are razor-edged and it's only taut direction that keeps it all from getting out of control. It's like something you might find in your dreams. (Which brings me to another thought: Jeunet would be the perfect choice, it seems to me, to direct a live-action version of Winsor McCay's LITTLE NEMO IN SLUMBERLAND.)

With Amélie Jeunet fully succeeds to light the magic in life throughout his gallery of portraits. The way he deals with the context to make it unreal may be disturbing but it's his poetic license to make up the dull ends of life. Of course if you don't feel like being happy you will rant you're fed up with those dreamlike images. You should have known French directors do not only shoot distressing movies. Some of them are so ambitious as to make movies for more people than a bunch of ill-fitting brains.,
359,2 September 2008,vincentdesmidt,1, only movie that made me feel sick,"I watched this movie because it was a rainy day and i had nothing else to do, but God this is an awful movie. there was nothing funny, exciting,romantic or moving about it. the only reason why people think this is because of the music(which really worked on my nerves). I had to think some time about why I hate this movie so hard before it became clear to me, but this is my conclusion: The character of Amelie is so freaky,(she's a total freak)that if she would have existed nobody would want to be associated with her. Probably she would have been bullied so much in her youth that she would have psychic problems and probably be in some kind of setting for mental people(sorry if my English isn't correct). And there is no normal person who would fall in love with her,like happens in the movie. if it was a spastic thin ugly guy who never washes himself it should have been a little bit credible, but otherwise this is completely wrong. Happy feeling? I felt miserable, and angry because I had lost so many time on this movie. everything Amelie did ennoyed me, and the reactions of the people ennoyed me even more, they should have reacted like: WTF go away are you sick in the head or what? Conclusion: if she would have died a terrible death with nobody who cared about her at the and of the movie, it would have cheered me up. the only positive thing about this film is that it is spoken in french, nothing more ennoying than French people talking English in Paris. Another thing: why does she look Chineze? the family Poulin is just a bunch of marginal people who have no friends. and the way they react they are just little children who will never be able to get a good job and earn money. and if Amelie wanted to try to step out of this marginality, and start acting normal, then it would be a good movie, now it sucked, because it is much to unrealistic. I can continue this for hours but I don't want to loose more time on this ""thing""(dont want to use the word movie)but I Will stop here.",

My Better Half, bless her cotton socks, cannot get along with subtitles whereas I find them much more agreeable and have no problems whatsoever. In short, you either love them or hate them and when they are found in a surreal movie with a quirky lead character then the chances are that many casual movie goers may be put off. But those of us with broader horizons will enjoy this modern and unusual love story with its wonderful cinematography, beautiful performances through the cast and a very strong Gallic flavour.

Audrey Tautou is superb as the delightful Amelie , a woman who is happy seeing other people happy but is missing a certain something in her own life ...Love. This film looks and sounds great but it does lose it's way a little bit in the final third.

This one has it all. It is exremely funny, stylish, thrilling and touching. I think the only movie that comes close to it is BArton Fink which also unites many elements to a great movie. The acting is brillant, too, especially Audrey Tautou is amazing. I think no one else could have played that part and I'm extremely worried that Hollywood's gonna do a remake starring Julia Roberts - urgh. This film shows that not only Hollywood produces well done movies but also Europe which seems to increase its ability to deliver masterpieces of cinema (in the last few years it delivered films like Billy Elliot, Trois couleurs: Rouge, Das Experiment, Lola rennt, Todo sobre mi madre, The Full Monty,...). I hope Le fabuleux... will win an academy award for best foreign language film, but I really doubt it'll win more, even though it truly deserves more as 2001 hasn't been a good year for movies. Jeunets work is the best there is this year and I wish that next year the first foreign language movie will win the award for best picture. You see, I'm very enthusiastic with this one and I cannot understand how someone can say that it's a bad movie. I am also very excited about its us-release and how it'll be liked by the American audience. But I think that especially in the present political situation a movie like this is the best that can happen. Like I said, the movie is pure magic and it's hard to summarize it, as it's so full of everything, that makes a movie worth of being watched. Furthermore the score by Yann Tiersen is one of the finest I've ever heard and I recommend everybody who liked the film to buy its soundtrack, you won't be disappointed.

The director clearly feels the temptation to take us off into a fantasy, with Amelie magically making everything perfect for everyone, but always pulls his story and characters back to earth to remind us that the theme of his story is neither spiritual nor sexual but emotional - about the desperate need we all have to be recognized as special by at least one other person we feel is special.",

The antics of Miss Amelie Poulain cannot fail to captivate the audience largely due to the impeccable casting of the mesmerising Audrey Tautou. Not only does she look the part but the idiosyncrasies she brings to the character mean that no-one else could even come close to playing the role. Pay particular attention to how she drinks the brandy in the café as she speaks to the man who has just been reunited with his childhood belongings. At times her devilish-looking smile appears mischievous but this is simply because, at heart, Amelie is still a child growing up in a world populated with adults who sometimes need a little help to have some fun.

396,26 February 2023,estarlincito,10, The main lesson of the movie Amélie,"The movie Amélie tells the extraordinary story of a young woman's mission to bring joy and delight to those around her. Amélie is a unique and endearing character who lives in the beautiful Montmartre neighborhood of Paris. Raised by her devoted but eccentric parents, Amélie leads an isolated life, rarely leaving the confines of her home or venturing outside her comfort zone. Growing up, she was bullied and teased for her unusual idiosyncrasies. This caused her to develop social anxiety, which she tried to manage by immersing herself in her own little world of oddities, daydreams, and musings. One day, while rummaging through her grandparents' belongings, Amélie finds an old tin box filled with toys, trinkets, and other items belonging to a long lost boy. Feeling strange kinship with the child, she begins a journey of self-discovery as she attempts to track down the owner of the box. Along the way, she meets a host of colorful characters who, in turn, help her to believe in the impossible. As Amélie strives to make the world a better place, she discovers that kindness and empathy are at the core of true happiness. A kind word or gesture can go a long way in making someone smile. She learns that it's ok to be different and embrace your unusual quirks. She also helps others to come out of their shells and embrace their true selves. Amélie's story serves as a reminder that life can be an incredible adventure if we allow ourselves to take risks and open our hearts to others. The movie encourages us to find beauty in the everyday, to be patient and kind to those around us, and to take the time to look for and appreciate the little details that make life special. Amélie teaches us that it's not about changing the world, but rather, changing the perspective of one person-ourselves-at a time.",

403,2 December 2002,johanleupen,7, An interesting effort that is enjoyable but highly overrated nonetheless.,"Amelie tells the story of a young girl's quest to make the world a better place by bringing people together. Rather than presenting us with grand narratives and extensive plot-devices, Jeunet starts off by focusing on the little things. It's refreshing to see a movie dedicated to detail and everyday life. For instance, every character is outlined by a micro-history catalogueing his or her likes and dislikes, which leads to some amusing scenes. Furthermore, Amelie's vivid imagination is captured by a terrific art-department and very dynamic camera-movements. However, as soon as Jeunet feels compelled to shift focus from setting up his environment to constructing a plot, he loses that which sets Amelie apart from other films. To be perfectly honest it's relatively tiresome to watch Amelie looking for and finding the love of her life. The strongest element in the movie is it's ability to steer away from (predictable) plot lines but unfortunately Jeunet eventually feels the necessity to conform to classic narrative. We are left with a movie that is enjoyable but highly overrated to be sure.",
404,3 August 2002,slinky-8,1, Cute but we've seen Ally McBeal,"The film is a worthy rental but extremely highly overrated. With many Ally McBealesque type effects over an overly cutesy story, Amelie is still a worthy viewing, has some funny and endearing moments, but is just a bit too over the top. At times the antics are a little dull and the movie prods a bit, about an asexual French girl (believe that one?) who wants to help people and finds love in the process. Amusing moments, decent script, some nice production, the film begins with a girl who is raised alone and lonely, away from other schoolchildren, and as a result enjoys her solitude although she is fascinated by the world around her. She learns to love helping others and does so in creative ways, sometimes straining credibility. Designed to pull on the heart strings, it does so somewhat effectively. Good viewing for couples but don't be surprised if it doesn't blow you away but just seems like a very cute production piece for candy viewing.",

407,18 April 2011,KnightsofNi11,7, A peculiar little film,"Looking for an extra dosage of quirk to liven up your day? Then look no further than Amélie, an odd little French film from French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Amélie is the title character of the story. She is a curious and naive young girl who takes a lot of enjoyment out of life's little pleasures. One night she finds a box full of knick knacks in her apartment that had been left there fifty years ago by a little boy. She tracks down this boy, who is now obviously a man, and returns the box to him. Upon seeing his reaction Amélie decides that she wants to devote her life to helping the people around her, only to discover that she has lost sight of helping herself. It is a strange little story that is fairly melancholy and leaves one with a fairly underwhelmed state of mind. At least that's how I felt.",
408,24 October 2007,ferbs54,10," A Magical Blend Of Fantasy, Reality, Comedy And Romance","Those of you who doubt that Paris, France is still the most magical and romantic city in the world should perhaps take a look at Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film ""Amelie"" (2001). In it, we meet a pretty, shy young woman, Amelie Poulain, who works in a Parisian coffee shop and whose favorite hobbies, we are told, are skipping stones, cracking open creme brulees, sinking her hands into sacks of grain, and daydreaming about all kinds of strange things. She soon becomes a combination secret benefactor, philanthropist, fairy godmother and protector for the unusual assortment of oddballs at her job and in her Montmartre apartment building, but is stymied when she meets and is attracted to an equally eccentric young man. Anyway, it is just as difficult to not use the word ""charming"" when referring to ""Amelie"" the film as it is to not use the word ""adorable"" when speaking of Audrey Tautou's Amelie herself. Ms. Tautou brings to mind another Continental actress named Audrey; yes, Audrey Hepburn. Indeed, in some shots, as when Amelie looks directly into the camera with that little mischievous grin, the resemblance really is something. Many magical things transpire in this highly amusing fantasy comedy--lamps come to life, snapshots speak--but I guess magical things can and WILL happen when a gal like Amelie is around. The film is remarkable to look at, with ingenious and colorful art direction, unusual camera angles, unexpected special FX, and--need I even say?--lovely Parisian backdrops. It is also, surprisingly, at times laff-out-loud funny. This picture is certainly not your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy, but something truly special that manages the tricky blend of fantasy, reality, comedy and romance. I can't imagine it not appealing to anyone with a heart and a sense of wonder. A real winner, indeed.",

Gradually she realizes her own life needs fixing, and a chance meeting leads to her most elaborate stratagem of all. This is a deeply wonderful movie, an illuminating mix of magic and pragmatism.

Audrey Tatou is great as the shy girl out to make her small world in Montmartre a better place by finding little ways to make someone's day, but forgetting to look after her own happiness in the process. Mathieu Kassovitz is adorable as Nino the eccentric collector.

419,4 June 2006,The_Triad,10, A film to cherish,"I'll start by saying that Amelie is easily one of my favourite films. It's about Amelie, a shy, day-dreaming, waitress who enjoys life's simple pleasures. One day, Amelie finds a small tin box in her house, and decides to return it to it's owner, the first in a long line of people who's lives she will make better (and worse) over the course of the film. On the surface, this could be just another ""quirky"" film popular with the more art-house types, but Amelie has a great emotional depth in it's central character that is unparallelled in any other film. Amelie is the poster girl for lonely, shy, weirdos everywhere who struggles to find love herself because she can't face reality. It's this subtle, quite distressing subtext that makes Amelie the great film it is and will surely be missed by those who don't make the connection with the character. Elsewhere, Amelie has great cinematography, script, acting, score and whether you notice or not, brilliant direction from the back on form Jean-Pierre Jenuet. On first viewing the film comes across a bit of a mystery. How is that gnome going all over the world? Who is the mysterious character who keeps getting his photo taken and throwing it away? But unlike some ""one-twist"" films, where once the mystery or twist is revealed there is no need for a repeat viewing, Amelie reveals depth in the characters within the main plot, and entertains with exchanges between the more minor characters, and a few very subtle sight gags. Right, problems... being this should be an impartial, critical review and all that, the one complaint I would have is that JPJ pushed the green a little too much on the DVD. If there is a shortlist for films to be considered ""the perfect film"" this would surely be on the list, and just might be the one to deserve that title.",

The first difference between apes and humans, if good´o´darwin was right and we are indeed relatives of the primates, is nothing else than imagination. I will always take my hat off in front of a creative soul and i will always worship guys who can find the proper esthetical path for their imagination. This is why i love the city of the lost children. But somehow jeunet´s conversion to light is maybe not so inspired. Of course i was seduced by all those simptomps of a grate imagination and by all those small details á la tex avery, i was amused by most of the characters and i am far from saying that i am disappointet by jeunet (as i could say about his co-national besson, but this is not the right place for that), i still fancy his studied images and his fetishism for color, but this movie gives me somehow the impresion that a highly spirited guy is trying to express himself in a language he is not quite proficient in. He is making compromises and uses supportive structures to make a message go through. The most annoying of them, i will be the devil´s advocate, is the way amelie looks in the camera, hence at us, whenever she has an idea or somehow wants to make an appeal to our comprehensive capabilities, like those extremely annoying conversation-lovers who do not waste any opportunity to act with two fingers from both of their hands, somewhere at the level of the ears, nobing with the head in the same time, all this just to express more or less, undoubtfully, that they are just using quotation marks.",

A film doesn't need to be deep to be a masterpiece, if Amelie would try to be more deep than it already is it would ultimately become a worse movie, this movie is not about taking things seriously, this film is about giving people an experience, a pure cinematic experience and it does such a rare thing as having the vast maiority of people who went to see this in the theater leave the theater more happy than when they entered.

Rarely, if ever, has a film so perfectly captured the spirit of a unique character and thoroughly infected its viewers with her charm. But what really caught me off-guard was the film's wonderful sense of humor. Amelie is so many light years more romantic, funny, and creative than Hollywood's recent so-called ""romantic comedies"", that the makers of such movies should be forced to quit their professions, move to Uzbekistan, and take up goat-herding.",

""Amelie"" is brilliant as a film, since it dives into that aspect of life which is regularly overlooked but always pivotal: details. How people's destinies are decided by funny accidents; moreover, how the narrator of the film spies and comments on everything makes us constantly aware of the fictionality of the film. This film is a great fictional work which is ridiculously honest about its fictionality, yet feels so real... maybe exactly because of this modest yet genius approach.

The movie made no sense to me and had no storyline or plot. I detest immature adults and the main character just acted like a stupid child.

Via his poetic and artistic techniques, Jeunet transports you into the separate realities of his characters, as successfully as Darren Aronofsky did in ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream,"" but Jeunet's pallete of emotions is far greater.

Now, I did think it was cute but I do think that some of these critics are french toasted by including it in that illustrious category. The film is about a cute- petite French woman who gets satisfaction out of doing favors for others and changing their lives. Now, I did like the premise (especially in today's times). However, I did think the film dragged as long as the Tour De France. Guys- I do not think that you will like this film too much. However, I do know a way to change that. Just tell your girl that you want to have a very romantic French night that would have to include- viewing a French film like `Amelie"", doing some serious French kissing during the boring scenes of the film, and maybe ask her to get a friend and do a serious menage a trois (that's French isn't) during the film's climax.

508,11 October 2014,dwpollar,7, Quaint little piece about a sheltered French girl...,"1st watched 10/11/2014 – 7 out of 10(Dir=Jean-Pierre Jeunet): Quaint little piece about a sheltered French girl named Amelie, played by Audrey Toutou, who attempts to turn her dreamlike life into reality through following a path of doing good deeds after finding a young boy's memory box behind a wall in her room. Her good deeds start happening after she delivers the memory box to the grown-up person --- who then pursues his ignored daughter and grandson. The complexity of this story and it's characters are actually too much to discuss in this short review – but I'll do my best. Her adventures start as a young child who loses her mother and is left with a father who does not relate to people, and therefore keeps her locked up as well until she is able to move away. She then tries to pursue life and love despite her faults and this movie portrays this journey. She works as a waitress in a local bar and is helped in this journey by an elderly painter who lives in her building. A mishmash of characters are introduced telling us their likes and dislikes showing us the director has a backstory for everyone of them. The one that Amelie eventually pursues is a man who has supposedly had the opposite experience in life by having too many people in it. He keeps a scrapbook of folks who take pictures in airport picture kiosk's and is obsessed with this. Her positive approach to branching out also benefits her in a personal way as she changes herself also -- before the end of the movie. This is more of a light comedy than a deep serious piece, but there is definitely meaning behind it the film. The dreamlike approach taken by the filmmaker makes it so you never know what's going to happen next and this is part of the joy in the film. This is a definite gem that should be treasured by moviegoer's throughout the world and hopefully opens the world up to this kind of cinema.",

There's no question that Amelie is artsy (perhaps a blatant stereotype to French Film), but that's ideal in that the main lead is an artist herself. Like many artists, a very wry and roguish Amelie (Audrey Tautou) is severed from much of the social, more intimate world she's been craving since conception. Motherless for most of her life and brought up to be isolated-due to an impending `heart problem'-Amelie constructed a magical sense to help others; but as many know it is sometimes much easier to help others than helping yourself. Not with the cameos in Amelie, however. Each one is profoundly characteristic, interconnecting their lonely features with Amelie's center ideal. Many of them are a tough catch. Amelie consoles their intriguing mishaps but can she venture solely for the companionship and closeness she craves?",

Now, I'm a sucker for romance and ""quirkiness"", and, yes, even cute, but this went way over the top. It reminded me of a commercial which desperately pushes every possible emotional button so that you will like it, but you just see right through it, change the channel, and decide you will never buy the product because of that commercial. Now imagine such a commercial going on for almost two hours, and you have this movie.

A bonus is the splendid photography in  and around Paris and especially of French railway stations and trains. Nor, despite the happy ending, does this fit into the standard Hollywood genre.

538,17 July 2021,TaylorYee94,7, I just wanted the right amount of quirkiness.,"I get why 'Amelie' attracted many moviegoers. It is cutesy and quirky at the same time, identifies with introvert and delicate audience, and is made in French, adding romantic and sophisticated vibes. However, the story is not powerful enough to consume me. During the movie, I cannot stop thinking this movie is trying so hard to be unique and one-of-a-kind. It overdoes everything. To emphasize Amelie's awkwardness and fear to face the interaction, the director pushes the story too hard to the level of creepiness and sneakiness. Even after her identity is revealed, she plots another plot. Also, while she butts in everybody's business and corrects his or her life, she always seems to know the right answer without even trying. Leap of logic right there. So many holes in the plot development to the degree in which one cannot ignore anymore. Another 'overdoing' by the director. Editing is unconventional: collage of videos following exact word of the narrator in a fast pace. This editing style brings more humor and comical vibes to the movie. However, the director adds dynamic camera movement to this already-exciting editing style. A modern motion picture is a flow of pictures for around two hours, and it captivates audience because it has ups and downs. However, during two hours of 'Amelie', there was no time to relax, think, or contemplate, ramped up to 100 all the time.",

The story and dialogue itself is very smart, but what really did it for me was the usage of color and composition. This is truly a great lesson in cinematography. The main colors in the film are green, red, yellow, B/W (not technically a color but a lack of), and blue. While green and red are used most (which I think signifies Amelie's moods and her view of her world), yellow is also used frequently (signifying neutrality), with blue only used sporadically (it signifies an important event or object - i.e. Nino's bag). The shot choices which brings these colors to life are also top-notch - you can freeze frame each frame of the movie and it will ALL be fascinating just to stare at.

Amélie's eyes: you can dive into them and swim around for days. Every face, every character, well cast, sharply defined. Like a Kubrick, a master of a totally different universe who has his own unique, recognizable style and vision, not just a multi-camera editor or anonymous hired hand.  He's thought it out, and wants to engage the audience.  A craftsman with a vision.  Who's got that now in international cinema? All special effects are for a purpose: not to wow you, but move you.

Behold the story of Amélie (Audrey Tautou), a young woman growing up in a home of methodical parents, who anxiously awaited the time to leave the house, and when the moment arrives, she leads a simple life working as a waitress until she discovers love , Happiness and the pleasures of life. The script is very well aligned with the film's proposal, and is extremely methodical, all the characters receive background, even those who did not need it, but this is part of the style of the film and script, Amélie's journey is almost epic, since her Journey goes beyond self-satisfaction, there is a need to make each character's story epic if we change our points of view. It is very difficult to write in words the moral that the film deals, we can say that it is the importance of dreaming and imagining, life will never beat if we are not looking at it, because Amélie is never, she applies a filter and it is enough to see the best Of all, never facing adversity from the front, and even those who insist on ruining their perfect world, she finds a way, either doing good deeds to get inside her filter or punished without losing her humor, but it's not just This message that the film passes, we understand that passion is intrinsic to the human being, and we see it in the most diverse characters and in the most diverse models of passions, be it passion for what it does, platonic passion or even paranoia search for perfection or To understand something, which is still a passion, the search to bring happiness to others and even show the qualities and defects of each character, thus humanizing everyone regardless of its character, And showing that everyone has passion, and that makes life good, and even then, I still think, that I lack adjectives to describe more the moral treated in this film. Technically, the film is beautiful, his photograph is clear, his mix and sound editing are great, his soundtrack is maginifica and mixes between a cheerful and depressive scholar, making the viewer go through all possible feelings, even his special effects are Good, but the best thing for me is the editing of the movie that dictates a perfect rhythm, it is extremely fast, it presents a lot of characters and contexts, and in the end it seems that you have absorbed much beyond what is shown on screen, another high point It's the camera angles that the director uses, they're simply fabulous, and they work almost like a character bringing in views. In terms of acting, all the characters are well, with obvious emphasis, for the actress Audrey Tautou, owner of a remarkable and natural beauty, besides possessing a good dramatic charge, the zoom that is always given in his face, dictates the Dramatic content of the scene, and his malicious grin makes any message from the movie seem extremely real. The experienced Jean-Pierre Jeunet recovers from unsuccessful works in the past, and returning to French cinema the filmmaker applies a direction that borders on complete perfection. Finally, ""the fabulous fate of amélie poulain,"" is a beautiful and masterful film with the ability to delight and impress everyone. ""These are not easy times for dreamers.""",

What I don't appreciate is people condemning it because of its high rating. This is a beautiful, heart-warming movie, in a time when all we can think about is slaughtering each other, and having the freedom of speech to not give a sh*t about anyone. Like Marty, while everyone is making epics, or $200 million wastes of time, Amelie tells a simple tale without embarrassment, using all of the director's visual flare, and bringing together a great cast. Audrey Tautou is gorgeous, her smile infectious, and her performance worthy of many awards. Funny, but in an unexpected way, charming, and well told, Amelie fully deserves its reputation. 8 out of 10",

583,1 November 2001,gianniz,9, Fabulous? Absolutely!,"From French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet comes a film with the most original and sparkling look I've seen in a decade. Using camera angles and colored filters we've come to associate with TV commercials -- the good ones -- Jeunet turns this romantic adventure of a young Parisian who's afraid of intimacy into a visual whirlwind. His film-making technique owes much of its inspiration to those small orbs of water we shake to see the snowfall, the flashing open-shut action of a painted Spanish fan, and the zig-zag movement of the skateboarder.  My favorite visual trick is the talking passport-size photos, not one, but four, images of a Spanish gent who dispenses advice to the love-lorn hero, brilliantly played by the endearing Matthieu Kassovitz.",

Within the first couple of minutes I was already enjoying the film and its surprisingly comic style. From the start to the finish the film continued to impress and delight with fantastical settings, well thought out twists and a generally excellent film to watch. Amelie really manages to refrain from being a soppy love story and despite the situation of Amelie herself it refrains from even a moment of sad or depressing storyline, even the death of Amelie's mother is light hearted! Overall the film will definitely be added to my collection, this film is a must see for anyone, don't let the subtitles put you off they are easy on the eye and the dialogue isn't too fast or complex to follow on screen. Check it out now!",

Our cute, but introverted, voyeuristic pixie (Audrey Tautou), and the ideals she coyly holds onto, are exposed on this sweet romantic ride. It's remarkably easy to relate to her self imposed underdog world and her escapism in taking on the role of avenger while impishly doling out good and some not-so good deeds. The details through the experience are exquisite treats. The Amelie experiment inspires and empowers. Timely in its humor, persuasive in its message and perfectly entertaining.

I was a little wary, but decided to immerse myself in the experience. From the opening of the movie, I could tell I was in for something different.  The images and the sounds were brilliant, whisking me away into a different world.  Character development was short and snappy, but very effective.  As each character is introduced, we hear little facts and intimate details about them.  Once you understand these details, you feel like you can really identify with these people.  They become more human and less cellophane.  The pace of the movie is sometimes difficult to follow, especially if you have to read the subtitles.  But it definitely is nice to hear the real actor's voices and intonations.  I really dislike how Hollywood tends to dubb movies for audience appeal.  Anyway, the plot is absolutely delightful!  The audience was laughing every few minutes, and every face was glued to the screen.  At the end, people applauded...twice! The last time that happened was when I went to see ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  This movie definitely ranks up there with that one.  But whereas ""Crouching Tiger..."" left you feeling somewhat unsure of what to feel, ""Amelie"" left me with deep satisfaction and a love for life and all its excentricities.",
596,14 November 2001,dgfgl,9, Jeunot does it again,"Jeunet is one of the best European directors (at least that's my opinion). After the strange movie that was the four sequel of Alien, Jeunet is able to return to the kind of movies that made him a great director, like Delicatessen, another GREAT movie. I have to say that I didn't know most of the actors (only those that appeared in another Jeunet films), but the most of them make a very good acting in this movie. Like the other movies of Jeunet, in the movie there's a kind of magic during all the movie, it reminds me of a faerie tale, with excellent secondary histories. I will say not much things about the plot, I think its better to discover it by yourself, I would only say that its a fabulous kind of tale, a history about the fear to love and loose that love, and well I think that i said too much. Go to watch it if you would like to see an excellent movie, and if you like it then watch Delicatessen and The city of the Lost boys (La ciudad de los niños perdidos in spain).",
597,28 February 2002,glgioia,10, I Thought The French Had Forgotten How To Do This,"I remember hearing a review of this film on the radio, the review was about as long as this movie. The critic liked the movie, I think, its hard to tell sometimes with them, but what I definitely felt was that he held back and couldn't throw in for it completely. His main complaint was the cinematic tricks which he said were overdone. I disagree. He also felt that the director blasts your psyche with images that are so poignantly memorable, you forget them. Or that is probably my interpretation of what he said after I just viewed this film, either way I agree with him. While watching it I was truly amazed by the beauty and thought of what I was witnessing. But its like an afternoon at the art museum, its all so much your brain simply wont register it and you wind up forgetting most of what you see. The story is a simple French love tale. Truly, that's all there is when you peel away the modernism and breathtaking cinematography. Its also the camera filming an ongoing battle of what's more enthralling, the Parisian backdrop or the heroine's beauty. Its a battle worth viewing. As someone who at times throws up his hands at the ever changing world and sees a Western Europe trying so hard to be American, this movie is all France. Its long, and halfway through you may find yourself checking your watch and groan just a wee bit. But when it ends, you'll forget it and want to do it all over again.

601,1 December 2001,blueprintfilms,10," beautifully crafted film, thoroughly enjoyed.","This is really the third major motion picture from writer/director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, following his magical film City Of Lost Children and 1991's Delicatessen. Amelie is the story of a young girl whose life changes when she comes across the hidden box of childhood memories of someone who lived in her apartment years ago. She sets out to find the mysterious owner of the box and when she does, her life changes in un-expected ways. The striking quality that enticed me throughout the film was the beautiful cinematography Jeunet employs in some of his scenes. There are many wonderful overhead shots that start behind the character and swim overhead in beautiful 360 degree wide angle shot to end near the characters feet or in their lap. Another rich quality that adds to the story is Jeunets use of silence. The film is scored with an emotional piano arrangement by Yann Tiersen, yet there are moments in the film when not a sound is heard, not a chord, or a breath exhaled. This use of silence offers a wonderful symmetry of drama and suspence to what the audience is viewing on the screen. Amelie is a gorgeous film with witty humor and a coy romantic story. Audrey Tauton's performance is exhilerating! She is undoubtably one of the most adorable faces in cinema today. Ironically the name should suggest a coy resemblance to Audrey Hepburn's charming demeanor that has entertained audiences for decades. Looking forward for more work from the talented team of Tauton and Jeunet.",

For me, this French comedy had the most clever, quirky, and interesting human character story since La Cage Aux Folle. It twisted and turned constantly, showing us Amelie's lonely and odd life and the goofy lives of the other characters while charming us at every turn, but it always guided us back to Amelie's diligent and very creative attempts to get the man of her dreams, detailing the ingenious ways she used to finally reel him in to great happiness for both.",

607,7 August 2002,bix171,6, Recommended And Forgotten At The Same Time!,"Though it's easily recommendable, Jean-Pierre Jeunet's trifle is just as easily forgettable. Try as he might, Jeunet isn't able to create anything remotely indelible in this sweet story of a wistful young woman (Audrey Tautou) who attempts to make the people who inhabit her world happier; when she comes across a book of strange portrait photography, she sets out to connect with the photographer (Mathieu Kassovitz). Jeunet pulls out all the animated and digital stops at his disposal and while it's never less than lovely to gaze at, it has the qualities of a comedy sketch television show (indeed, it has the feel of a low-key French Monty Python) and when the mysterious old man in the apartment below that appears in every French romance starts to become a major character, you know there isn't much point in paying close attention. Some might find this simple but densely-packed feature charming in its innocence (and goodness knows we need more films like this that have no use for violence) but others might be immune to its charms because of its one-dimensional presentation.

Naturally, my feelings for this movie are a tad over the top. This one was a yellow spot in a grey world of explosions, gun fire, and death. And we all missed a movie like this to put a smile on our face again. The setting is the most beautiful city in the world. Amelie is a young and naive girl who had a difficult childhood due to a series of mistakes and accidents. Her world was an exquisite one. It still is. One day she decides to change the life of the people around her. And perhaps her own as well. This is the plot to a good natured, beautiful and engaging movie, which conquered its audiences by being itself, and nothing more. This was a project dreamed by Jeunet long ago, and it shows the level of dedication that all the creative team put on this movie. But I don't have any more words to describe it, it ringed many bells of mine, and I will probably see it again. A great smile in the face, that's what the world needs. Jean-Pierre Jeunet did it.",

The camerawork was excellent.  I rewatched scenes over and over marveling at the expertise and beauty of the movie.  The story was fun and quirky in its telling.   The colors were vivid.  Some scenes shimmered with color.  DVD extras discussed the filming and are worth taking the time to watch.  Audrey Tautou was perfect in the title role.  The whole movie was well cast and well written.  It was filled with small stories that were entertaining by themselves.  The gnome story could be a movie by itself. Anyone with an interest in good cinematography would enjoy this movie and should watch it.  It sets a high standard for use of the camera, use of color and good pacing.

613,23 May 2006,synkronized-1,10, I want to be Amelie!!!,"One of the main reasons I love French movies so much is that the French directors always have a good eye for visualization. It's all hidden in little details (like colours) and interesting angles of camera. And ""Amelie"" I think is one of the best examples of it. Probably even THE best. And this movie also has a great and very talented story. Makes you laugh from the bottom of the heart and there's even a scene when you're ready to cry with Amelie. Every time I see it I actually think that I want to be just like Amelie. I want her determination and her joy of life. This movie shows how happiness is really on the small things. And that you have to grab chances. And that you can make life worth living! And of course I enjoyed those weird and most creative ideas (like the traveling elf, suicidal fish etc.) Cast is wisely picked. They totally complete each other. Audrey Tautou is perfect for the role of Amelie. She carries a bit of mystique touch in herself and that was necessary for the character of Amelie as well. Plus she's really sweet. And actually - how many people in this world actually care about people next to you and people you don't even know? Most people are just really egoistic, but Amelie is like this little light who suddenly cares and makes things better. Mathieu Kassovitz is a very talented actor and director as well. Perfect choice for the role of Nino. He also carries out that mysterious side. The side of little weirdness, but in a good very sense. And I also have to point out the music of this movie. Yann Tiersen has completed a fabulous score. This is something extremely romantic and totally french-like. Definitely 10 points out of 10. And believe me, I would give a lot more.",

So romantic, or least that's the stereotype and the newest French film from the great director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, City Of Lost Children), won't put an end to that.

637,29 March 2012,jim-austin-327-623727,9, Sheer Brilliance!,"Amelie is a quirky romantic comedy. It is refreshing to see those two words together. One of my favorite things about this movie is how it manages to be bizarre, unique, and surreal but still deals with real life issues. Issues that are so close to my heart, however, and I do not know if everyone can connect to the story. I think this piece of literature exemplifies everything I've studied in my World Literature class and that is why it speaks to me. First of all, it revolves around the ""artist figure."" Amelie is an artist, disconnected from society but wanting to impact it. That is why I identify with her so much, because she is a shy individual and she learns that she can't keep letting her chances for happiness pass her by. It is great that she is helping those around her, but you can't truly help others until you help yourself. That beautiful, heartfelt central message is what had me in tears. Good literature (and movies) give you an outpouring of mixed emotions which leave you not quite knowing what to think (and gives you a lot to think about after its over). The technical aspects of the film are quite brilliant. The script has believable dialogue. All of the characters and interesting and well rounded (The glass man being my favorite). Everything fits together in a perfect piece. The cinematography is quite stunning. Each camera pan and swoop is just breathtaking. The colors add to the fantasy of the story. All in all, from the performances, to the storyline, to the look of the movie is shear brilliance.",

With an incredible pace Jean-Pierre Jeunet creates a completely unique atmosphere where he plays with luck and predestination. This starts with the conception of Amelie and goes on with important events/traumas in the life of a child. The voice-over works very well here and gives the feel of watching a pseudo-documentary (like Woody Allen's Zelig). The absurdity of many situations and explanations are extremely humorous.

It's with the latter that we all seem to have some learned societal trait to avoid taking said risks, in being different, rather pushed to assimilate, masquerading our idiosyncrasies and seeing being unique or 'weird' as a flaw. In this respect, Amelie is an unusual fairytale that uses its oddly charming story and cast of quirky characters to deliver a charming and ultimately uplifting film brimming with a child-like splendor, full of an unmitigated aspiration to view the world through a technicolor lens, one of pure enchantment. A definite re-watch.",

She had a lot of love for her fellow human beings and in the process she falls in love with a fellow introvert and quirky photo collector named Nino.  It is a great love story in every sense of the word.  I wish Audrey Tautou could have been nominated for an Oscar but the film was nominated five times over, so it wasn't a total downer.

667,14 June 2020,calderonp8,9, Leave your comfort zone,"Amélie is a beautiful love story that covers important subjects like happiness a letting go of our comfort zone to face the world outside.
When the movie started I was not really sure what to expect, I had heard about the movie but I never really had much interest in watching it. However when I started watching it and saw the visual and artistic style of the film I knew it was gonna be good. Usually I don't like narration in a film too much, but in this one I believe it worked perfectly to set the mood. I really liked how it starts with completely unrelated events being shown to lead to the birth of the main character.
All throughout the movie you can see how since a child Amelie has been kind of living in her own bubble, mainly because of her parents who were never really there for her the way that parents should be there for their children. This leads to Amelie living most of her days inside her head, even as an adult. She doesn't relate much with others, until she finds something that allows her to make someone happy. When she gives the box to the man and literally fixes his life, as he'll now go back and reconcile with his daughter, I would have liked it if she told him it was her who gave it to her. I understand why she didn't, and how it's part of her personality.
The scenes where you can see what she is thinking displayed in her TV are just great, how she sees herself becoming the ""mother of the unloved"", but I feel like if she had followed this path she might not have found happiness herself. Because of this it's important when she starts doing something for herself, which is to find love with a person similar to her. Mr. Dufayel also plays an important part in the film because he can ultimately be seen as the outcome of living a life full of reclusion and little human interaction. It's thanks to him that Amelie decides to just leave her comfort zone and take a risk by actually meeting Nino in her apartment where they display their love. This however makes me think, can you love someone without really knowing them? or is it more that you love the mystery and escape from your life this person offers to you?
The movie's greatest message in my opinion is that of leaving your comfort zone and taking risks, regarding of their outcome. This is something I can relate to, as it always hurts more to wonder ""what if?"" than to face the actual outcome of the situation. What could have been a simple love story was made in a way that is more thought provoking and has a great final message that applies to everyone.",

Even the brittle bone disease of one of the characters and Amelie's occasionally commented on melancholia get short shrift as the sunshine and light of the whole film bulldoze through anything that may upset the viewer. Certainly, it pleases, but in an Easter sort of way where all the chocolate is in danger of making you feel the slightest bit like you have had too much sugar.",

When I watch a movie I expect to be able to relate to one character, or at least find a character so villainous that the movie helps me to understand and breakdown societies concepts of good and evil, especially in the real world. I watched this movie on the recommendation of many others and cannot cipher why they would put me through such agony? I prefer movies with a bit more depth. I watch a variety of movies and can appreciate many different styles, but it seems like the director is trying to emulate older French directors like Godard, and fails miserably. Being different for the sake of being different never makes for good TV, and in this case a good movie. Being different with a unique style that reaches to the audience will leave the viewers walking away with something besides a feeling of waisting 2 hours of their time.",

Being such imaginative work of writer-director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, The City of Lost Children), Amélie has become one of the most iconic films of contemporary French cinema, an obligatory reference to the magical atmosphere of Paris. The film is presented with a beautiful and dynamic visual approach (great camera work by Bruno Delbonnel and meticulous editing), reaffirming Audrey Tatou's character's French identity with an amusing score for piano and accordion by Yann Tiersen.",

After a rather mediocre, if somewhat underrated Alien: Resurrection, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet is back on form.

The story works incredibly well on a visual level. This is a postcard Paris and everything has that unreal sense about it. Its almost as if too much talk will spoil the imagery. Thankfully this never happens. It is also good that some scenes are not explained like the sequence where Lucien is practising some insults (it seems.),

But those people are the ones who enjoy nothing more than not to be happy, they might be what in France we call ""enfants gâtés"" : who don't know the price of a fair smile, one of the things usually nobody never gives to nobody for nothing, one of the things people keep for them, selfish we are... What Jeunet gives us here is a reason to smile for a few minutes, and that is very very much, so don't be shy, don't refuse the joy that is given here, let it work as it is intented to work, do this or don't buy the DVD. It is rare that a movie acts as a perfect universe, where you have nothing to add or to remove. Some Capra movies do it for me, Croutching tiger hidden dragon or Hayao Miyazaky movies (Chihiro) too... and so does Amelie. This means it is one of that movies you can watch again and again and again, taking pleasure in the same places, not in missed details. You heard all about it I guess : charming, cute,... it is, and that is funny to see how deeply it is when such feelings are usually not considered as very deep : no passion, no tragedy, no bloody revenge, nothing that makes the heart go 250 bpm. Amelie will easely make you forgot most of the recent ""blockbusters"", this is one of the kind that lasts, one of the kind you can buy in DVD without fear of any disapointment.",

Mostly these films portray the political problems the country is struggling with, and this is always done with extreme and painful realism. It is a liberation to have Jeunet in the midst of this. The co-director (with Marc Caro) of the two masterpieces Delicatessen (1991) and The City of Lost Children (1995) chose a different path this time. This story is very sweet, but it is done with extreme technical insight and originality. In other words, although it is another concept, it is still a recognizable Jeunet film. Jeunet is alongside Tom Tykwer and Danny Boyle forming the new European wave of brilliantly skilled directors with great visions. ",

Filmed and arranged in a style that can only be described as ingenious, Jean-Pierre Jeunet combines love, friendship, comedy, mystery and magic in this exceptional film which has featured in cinemas all over France for over eight months, even after its DVD release. The story of Amelie, set in Montmartre, Paris is realistically filmed, and although a happy film, it still features the realities of Paris today:- the people who ask  for money in the Metro, the pornographic shops on boulevard de Clichy, the lonely people alone in their appartments, and the alley cats! A wonderful plot, which unfolds progressivley throughout the film, and leaves one feeling warm and happy, with the help of the delightful music composed by Yann Tiersen of course.

Thank goodness it had english subtitles but it was indeed such an excellent movie and with a superb soundtrack...It was a 13-hr flight and Amelie was the first movie i saw and i was so struck by it that all the other inflight movies (chocolat / vertical limit?! /finding forrester..etc) really paled in comparison... I'm still so struck down by the simple, fantasy-like storyline which is romantic, funny and quirky all at the same time! ;) The actors were really good and carries the whole movie all the way through especially Audrey as Amelie...she is not only beautiful... she really makes you fall in love with Amelie... This is definitely one of the best movies i have seen...and i'm hoping that it will show in the cinemas here soon coz i would love to just watch it all over again....and again...

This starts with the conception of Amelie and goes on with important events/traumas in the life of a child.

It's hard to describe, but ""Amélie"" made me a six year old boy again, that, first time in a cinema, watched with an open mouth and big eyes 'the wizard of oz'. I'm 33 years old and i saw tons of movies, but no one kicked me like ""Amélie"". I had the feeling not to watch a movie, it was more become a part of the wonderful world of Amélie Poulain, which definitely depends on Bruno Delbonnels incredible greatful camera-works and one of the best storyscripts written the last years. Jeunot and Laurant created lovely, bizarre, obscure and mischievous characters and they where filled with so much live by excellent and marvelous actors (specially Audrey Tautou, Matthieu Kassowitz and Dominique Pinon)that everything went perfect. It's a cineastic pleasure to watch garden-dwarfs travelling around the world, to learn what the production of crepes have in common with the production of vinyl-records or to enjoy how a goldfish survives suicide. And when Amélie takes care, that the hypochondric tabac-woman and the pessimistic regular become passion lovers and having wild sex at the cafe-toilet or she protected the small shophelper from his tyrannic chief by drivin him slowly insane, you don't know if you're tears coming from laughing or sentimental emotions. When i went out of the cinema, i walked like a feather and wanted to embrace the whole world.

Then another is of course that Amelie's friend where s/he takes her father's garden gnome around the world. That was pretty was extremely hilarious! But not as hilarious when Amelie thinks about how many orgasms are going on in town. Then, one by one, they show exactly how many there are going on! Strange, but it made me laugh out loud unlike any humour i have ever seen on film. Maybe because french humour is like that! I do not know! The computer graphics make the film very modern and suitable to today's modern cinema! The editing (particulary with the hilarious orgasm scene)makes you really get into it and there is nothing in the film that can possibly bore you to death. If so, i would like to hear it! This films makes you laugh, think, and sometimes shock you at the tragic moments, which is kind of rare in the film. But its a really light-hearted, really funny, french film.

Its about a lonely young Parisian woman, Amélie, who enjoys the simple things in life; plunging her hand into a sack full of beans, cracking the top of crème brulée, and skipping rocks in the Canal Saint Martin.  Amélie decides to take it upon herself to change the lives of some of the people she lives around, like her father, her neighbor, the concierge, and those who work in a fruit stand of the corner of her street.

The Montmartre area of Paris is lovely, bathed in a golden glow.  The supporting cast is an interesting collection of folks, none of whom is as lovely as Amelie herself.  There is an impishness to much of her good works, especially involving a heartless greengrocer who mistreats his assitant. Of course Amelie's good works lead to her finding a love of her own, but the path isn't easy. This is a heartwarming, funny, charming film that is worth working through the subtitles.",

Amelie skips along the surface of the world, doing good deeds to strangers whom she cannot even face or talk to. When she falls for a guy, she can't even talk to him. The whole thrust of the movie I took to be that Amelie needs to wake up from a dream world and she does so at the end, with its implications of sexuality. To really love someone is dangerous in this movie, as in the world: look at the man in the cafe who is frankly stalking his former girlfriend. His possesiveness ends up ruining his budding romance with the hypochondriac. This is the dangerous undertow of sexual love.",

757,26 July 2002,easmith03,9, Very satisfying,"I watched this movie on DVD, and really enjoyed it.  Amelie, the main character in the film, is painfully shy and introverted.  However, upon feeling the satisfaction of doing a good deed for a stranger she sets out to do more good deeds for others.  There is some great subtle humor, but not any real belly laughs.  Likewise, there are some sentimental moments, but nothing to really draw tears.  The version I saw was in French with English sub-titles.  I found this a little distracting.  The film also uses some interesting techniques to convey the feelings and thoughts of the actors. The characters in the film have kind of sparse dialog, there is a voice-over to fill in the gaps, but the film has many short ""dream like"" or surreal scenes that fill in the characters thoughts and emotions.  For example in one scene when Amelie comes face to face with a man she has a crush on, as she walks away, she actually turns into a puddle of water and splashs on the floor, kind of Alley McBeal style.  Sometimes there are little dreams played out briefly just in a corner of the screen.  I found this unique for a film, and thought they added conveying the emotion of the characters in the film. The film has a different look, style, pace to it from movies I'm used to seeing.  Maybe because it is French, or maybe just because it is a different kind of film.  This unique look is something that I enjoyed about the movie. I found a couple of spots where the story seemed a bit slow, but all in all, I found it to be really entertaining, and left me feeling quite satisfied.",

When It finished I was just too stunned to speak and I was overwhelmed with emotions, and that's when I fell in love with it, I longed to see it again and again and even tried to download it, but to no avail..so instead to cure my love and obsession with Amelie, I visited as many sites as possible and re-lived the movie via still images and quotes etc..Eventually years passed and alas in the year 2006(now) for a Christmas present, a bestie of mine surprised me by buying Amelie on DVD for me, I was so shocked and surprised and I just screamed and hugged her!! I knew you could purchase the DVD, but I didn't even realize that you could buy it here in Australia unless you had ordered online, from then on i've been watching it almost daily, and I like to relive it by watching it on a regular basis, there are alit of skeptical people who badmouth the movie and label it as ""crappy, boring, false and unintersting or even a complete waste of time!!"" but i say those people should just keep quiet, if they don't like the movie then why don't they keep their horrible opinions to themselves, I am a fan of the movie and hearing their horrid and rude comments just make me mad, in fact if they don't even like the movie why don't they just not write or say anything or even go on another site for amelie haters..oh no, I'm giving those haters idea's!! About the movie, comments and all: The movie was just breathtaking and spectacular, it had the right amount of comedy, romance and mystery..now thats my kinda movie..I absolutely adore Amelie's actress Audrey Tautou, she's gorgeous, superb and has a natural gift of acting, I also loved Mathieu Kassovits as Nino, they have a real chemistry between them and they go so well together, like uh peanut butter and nutella(yum!!) I loved Joseph and his paranoid theories, they were absolutely hilarious, I almost was in tears when he came up on the screen, I feel sorry for all his exes lol, and Lucient was such a cutie with his obsession with lady di, and Nino was a perfect match for Amelie, with their similar childhood history and dreams, but of course as you all probably know, Audrey Tautou stole the show as the vixen and extremely adorable Amelie Poulain, she was hilarious, and such a cutie especially how she felt it was her job to set those meanies straight ala collignon and that horrid neighbor who blamed her for the accidents that occurred leaving the poor bloody child traumatized, overall this is my favorite movie, it has everything that you need and it's such a typical girls movie with a hint of peculiarness(if that's even a word!) and all the right lines and quotes and lines, and I reckon that if other actors and actresses were used the movie would not have been the same, the movie is outstanding and i have to say..anyone who hasn't seen the movie..please do..it's a wonderful Movie and you'll agree in the end like moire that it truly is the best movie..thank you all..",

It's not the best movie I have ever seen for there is a diversity of genres in cinema that are impossible to compare. But if you confine to the genre of fairy tales, and Amelie is kind of a fairy tale, then it is the best movie I've ever seen. It is full of splendid, crazy, funny, marvelous ideas, more than you can capture by seeing this movie only once, it has this congenial music by Yanne Tiersen (go and get the CD sound track !!!), it has this inimitable French charm, and above all: It has Audrey ""Amelie"" Tautou who is a sparkling jewel among all the equal-looking and equal-acting young (Hollywood) actresses of this planet.

I really enjoyed Amelie as much as I did Delicatessen and The city of lost children, and the whole aesthetics of Alien: resurrection. Who gives a damn if this one is only for making you feel good?; we should be grateful instead for that simple reason.

One day Amelie finds a box of treasures hidden by a little boy in the wall of her apartment, she decides to return it to him. This results in Amelie realising that her actions can influence people. she sets out setting up love connections, playing tricks on a mean neighbour and ends up falling in love herself. Paris comes off looking like a lovely place to live - though it always does in films, you never see the cruddy parts. It was a colourful wee film , most of the characters are a bit oddball.

If it is dubbed, it takes away the sense of originality and beauty that was intended to be portrayed to the audience in the original script. It allows for the performances to be more accurate and at the same time, more enjoyable. In Amelie, we are taken through the lifestyle of a woman with a huge imagination who in reality is only a waitress at a small French coffee shop. We are taught to believe that she does not care about the huge things in life, which in this film is Princess Diana's death, and that she only cares about the people around her. Throughout the film, she tries to help them improve their lives and in the process, try to improve her own. It is a beautiful portrait of the human spirit and how one person can make a difference in another person's life. Amelie was played by a lovely French actress named Audrey Tatou, whom in my opinion should have garnered a Best Actress nomination for this movie. She is able to successfully portray a shy woman who is willing to do anything to see her friends happy. Amelie uses clever tactics to enlighten the people she loves and irritate the people she hates.

This is some of the side effects this movie can do for you. When everything goes wrong in the world, many fell alone, sometimes depressed, losing faith in the life, worried of our future... A movie like this one makes you realize how much everyday life is important, how great life can be, how much we should enjoy all the little things that makes our life, our experience, our difference. This movie is so good, touch you so deeply, that some people preferred to protect themselves (being sarcastic, pragmatic, critic) when they saw it. I read a lot a reviews before going to the movie theater, and even I was expecting something really wonderful, I was far beyond the real value of this pure, state of the art performance. Speaking of criticisms, I remember one of them from a New York Business journal, writing how disgusting was the film, how the sweetness of the story was tasteless... Is this a surprise ? Not really. When you are driven by business values, and you believe your level of happiness is more or less the amount of money you earn or the size of the car/house you own, you can not just think happiness as a simple thing. To critics that found the movie was not realistic, not a true picture of life or Paris, not just trustable... Is not the purpose of a movie to make you dream, to make life looks better ? Why don't use the same critics against all Hollywood movies ? Do you really believe the stories ? In you everyday life, do you really think people look as pretty as in these movies ?

But there's no turning back and when you follow your heart and try to do some good in the world, nothing's quite so bad. In a flash, you multiply joy and it all comes back. With a bit of inspiration, Amelie proves that you don't have to accept the status quo. You'll be in a better place when you take charge of your life and begin creating your our own happiness.

You think it is going to be easy filming technics, easy laughs and not much of a movie. But this technics is used to give you an overview of all the actors in the movie. And it is quite entertaining. You are left to wonder how much of the actors you are going to know before the movie is over. Well hold your brace! You will enter their EMOTIONS. And that is were this movie is incredibly well made. It is common feature for a long boring slow moving flick to let you enter emotions like sadness, love, hatred ... But this movie while slowing down in pace is still going about 90 miles/hour. And yet you begin to feel the rewards of knowing all the characters in depth. The movie fills your heart, fills your brain and atop of it makes you laugh with its crazyness that resembles a high speed dream of your own (a bit like Woody Allen in this respect). But on the opposite of Woody Allen style that strays away from the main story to get lost in details and escapes, this movie progressively focuses on the heroin and on her dream. Mix all this with alluring filming technics that shifts back and forth from 1950's still standing camera to today's ultrafast travelling (reminding Hidden Dragon, Crouching tiger) and you have a wonderful movie for people that mind their emotions.

I mean Amelie may seem kinda stalker-ish in the beginning, but at least she tries and helps out people later on in the movie! In some way I do kinda relate to her since she was kind of a loner in the movie who tries to help people. Overall, I found this movie good and this movie made me check out Tautou's other works. I give it an 8 out of 10.",

798,21 November 2004,maplesugar2005,10, The reason this is a great film is...,"This film is loved by so many (for those of you who are nay-saying) because it is a perfect metaphor of the lives of so many. The fact that Amelie herself is so painfully shy and unsure is modeled by the lives of so many. She is strange, and we all are strange. She has her little ways, we all have our little ways. I feel there are so many little things in this movie that are overlooked by some: these overlookers, I feel, are those people who rush about their lives with too much to do and never get the chance to take time to enjoy the small things in life, like dipping your hand into a sack of grain. These people obviously don't have the time to fully enjoy such a timeless masterpiece that Amelie is. Amelie is in many ways a coming-of-age. While she is technically grown-up, she is really young. It takes time for her to learn that it is OK to love someone. That it is OK to show emotion. This is coming from a girl who had never been shown emotion. And that in itself is a precious gift. ",

One of the best scenes: Nino sitting in the booth ad Amelie behind him writing the menu on the board and he turns around and insists she is the girl in the picture but the coward in her takes over and insists that that is not her and the look on her face as she walks away is priceless.",

She tracks him down and surreptitiously returns it to him. Seeing the joy that it brings him, Amelie decides to intervene in people's lives in small, quirky ways.

They are fairytale films set in fantastical worlds. They are also dark movies. Both of which I enjoy. What made the films overcome their lack of emotion for me was the strong atmosphere.

It has a cover closely resembling that of the original Amelie title, but is a completely different movie, even though it claims to be by the same director Jean-Pierre Jeunet. The sleeve blurb outlines the storyline (in incorrect English) of what is actually happening in that mysterious movie, which is quite distinct from the original, e.g. different characters, storyline and names. Actually, Audery Tatou plays a character called ""Irene"", there is no Amelie Poulain in that movie at all! Among the mysteries are: The sleeve claims it to be a Miramax release, but I could not find any reference anywhere on websites to do with Coen Bros, director, actors or by Miramax itself. On the other hand, it is a full-feature length professional film production with high technical standards, and undoubtedly Audery Tatou herself is acting in it. However, it has a poor and depressing story line, and is a clear attempt of latching onto the success of Amelie without the visual quirkiness and humorous attention to detail. What is going on here? Has someone assembled a new film out of discarded production material? Is it a secretly produced sequel that turned out so bad that it was swept under the carpet, and subsequently leaked into the Chinese DVD copy circuit?

The sequence in which the quadruple photo talks is actually an existing commercial (for the Region sardinia, check out sardinian coat of arms and you'll understand). The sequence of  the old russian movie with subtitles actually talking of something else has been overused by creatives everywhere. It's not a matter of copying, it's a matter of manipulating an enormous collage of images and situations that grows every day in communication around us.

There are many side threads but in the latter half of the movie a relationship starts developing between Amélie and a man who collects thrown-away passport photos.

The films Delicatessen, La Cité des Enfants Perdus, and Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain are dark movies.  The colors are dark and each character has a flaw, but there is always the protagonist that has a bright color to them and brings light to the story.  Whether it's Louison the clown, One the strongman, or Amélie the dreamer, they all bring a sense of light and hope into the lives of the other characters. The cinematography of these films is also rich and beautiful.  The scenes can be dark and ancient-looking and still be gorgeous.  What might otherwise seem scary looks like wisened beauty that plays as the perfect background to the story such as the box full of memories and the hole where it was found or a photo album full of distorted or torn pictures pieced together, but not quite to their original state. Another characteristic of Jeunet's movies that I like are the facial expressions of his characters.  While a minor detail, they add so much to the film.  Look back at the expression on Amélie's face when she holds up the spoon that she uses for cracking the top surface of her creme brulée, the look on Dufreyal's face in his video.  On Nino's face when he first encounters Amélie.  Of young Amélie when she has to say goodbye to her only childhood friend at the bridge.  Of Blubber as he looks up at Amélie sadly (who would have thought a goldfish could look so sad and betrayed). Jeunet's films are also known for their sounds.  Of voices, sound effects, and of course, the beautiful music he chooses as the backdrop for his stories.  Yann Tiersen's music matches the mood of its characters who are classic French with a touch of modern quirkiness.  It consists of the accordion matched with rhythms that are both haunting and charming, of bells that sound with the innocent, child-like ideals of Amélie, and holds moods that play up those being expressed in the scenes in which they are played. Jeunet has turned his film into a beautiful display of art that works on many different levels with varying shades of nuance.  He has proven again of just how much of an artist he is through the people he chosen to create his vision and how beautifully he has orchestrated these elements into creating his newest masterpiece ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain"".",
858,8 April 2008,zmollusc,1, Strange nose fetish film,"This appears to have been made to cater to those with some kind of bridge-of-the-nose-philia. A film to cater for breast-obsessed types would have many gratuitous shots of cleavage, this film has many close-ups of the lead actress's face from an odd, high, nose-bridge-enhancing angle. These strange set pieces are interspersed with scenes of the lead character not doing anything of interest. She is aided in this by the supporting cast who also do nothing of any interest. The setting is in some strange parallel France that isn't full of litter and graffiti. To save money, the director had the film developed by a bagful of colourblind hedgehogs which is why the colours in the film look wrong.",

There has always been something that has stopped me from seeing it.  So I finally got a copy of it and as I watched it I became enthralled by the beauty, simplicity, and magic of the main character and the story itself.  You root for the character almost from the beginning of the story as you see her terrible childhood, and see her loneliness only increase with time.  And instead of thinking of herself she thinks of others in an attempt to fill the void in her life.  But it does not last for long and she begins to see that her life isnt all that she wants it to be. And her attraction to Nino is quite apparent.  And you see that he is very much like her. . . a dreamer.  Audrey Tautou is absolutely magnificent in her role.  She exudes this sort of kindness and thrill for life but with a loneliness keeping her life from being perfect.  And the rest of the movie is filled with characters seemingly pulled right off the street and into the movie. . . not shells of characters with no depth like in most movie.  This movie is definately a 10 and rightly deserves it.",

This film taps into our fantasy is that the dreamers are out there, somewhere, hoping that we'll see that they're not just physically gorgeous, but also quirky, thoughtul, inventive, and ready to embrace and nurture our own lovable quirks. Still, I'm surprised that IMDB users have ranked this film so absurdly high on the all-time list. C'est la vie!",

But it isn't the soft-around-the-edges feel that makes an impact -- its the darker mischief. Amelie herself plays pranks involving shock-therapy, her boyfriend-to-be splits work between a porn shop and a horror show, and one of the most charming characters is an obsessive stalker.  The effect is a contagious warmth for scratching beneath the surface, good will hunting, and collecting trash -- all for storybook love.  Good not-exactly-squeaky-clean fun.",

Jean-Pierre Jeunet has been going down hill slowly for many years and this is better than some he has done but by far not the best. Audrey Tautou is the main appeal in this film and I wonder if it would have reached the level of media attention it did with out her. Again we see art for arts sake something dressed up and strutting around like it's yet more highbrow art when all it really comes across as is pop culture pap for the masses. It is extremely overrated and hyped beyond all that it offers, all be it a sweet. If you have nothing better to do then worth a watch as its relatively inoffensive, if you can get over the saccharin aftertaste it will leave in your mouth.",

I absolutely fell in love with this movie. It's a quirky, uniquely wonderful film. One of the main reasons people recommended this movie to me was because I was a big Pushing Daises fan, and Amelie and Pushing Daises both share that colorful, whimsical feel. The awkward love story and the awkward characters and plot lines are everything I could ask for in a film. Audrey Tatou gives an amazing performance, and it's difficult not to fall in love with her by the end of the film. Amelie is one of those films that changes your perception of things, and truly makes such trivial things seem so much more beautiful.",

So i rent the DVD and i think will never forget bout this movie forever. The movie kinda slow but the story is charming beautiful. Lot of weird things happened and you will feel good at the end of the movie. don't put high expectation to this movie and you may give 9 over 10 stars for this as this movie deserved that kind of respect. Its good if you watch this movie with the original sound (in french) and not dubbed version because dubbed version cannot give you the real emotion for what the characters is giving you. Watch this movie with family and friends!,

The contrast from the character, foreground, mid-ground and background are just right and create a nice depth of field and addition to that is the lighting, from key lights, fill lights, backlight and prop lights. The lights give as a cloudy look or we're in the state of dreaming or euphoria. The make gives the character a strong facial expression even without trying and it goes with her hair provided more strong independent woman. The costume design, she wears a nice and simple dress that does not distract the audience during the film. The Color Palette goes with the props and accessories and was planned and collaborated ahead of time during pre production. I also like the editing techniques used during post production, seamless and invisible. Overall it is outstanding movie and will watch it again and again to hone more knowledge from the creator of this film. There are more techniques used from writing, camera movements and angles, etc... and more to dig in from this movie for our future film makers.",

You'll find yourself involuntarily smiling throughout. The main character Amélie (played superbly by Audrey Tatou) is such a pleasant character, who you feel yourself really relating to. The support cast were outstanding too, and in the two hours you get to know so many of them so well. With very unusual photography and direction, special effects reminiscent of Ally McBeal, a very sweet story (which can sometimes seem a little bit jumpy), and characters that you genuinely care for Amélie is an absolute must-see.

It's as if Amelie sheds her light to everybody and everything surrounding her rendering them interesting to the viewer as part of her world.Nothing groundbreaking, or dramatic or really ""important"" happens in the film..But the plot can't be criticized.Nor the depth factor if we want to be fair...The movie is after all and in all it's immense artistic beauty a ( somewhat romantic)comedy .The dialog and narration are very witty as is the surprise ending.And as in other European movies artistic references are also present. The effort to understand the inner emotions of a girl in portrait by Renoir is an obvious example.Asking for more would probably be something similar to asking more salt in a cake... So is it perfect? Well to me in it's genre is as close to cinematic perfection as anyone ever reached.The replay value of the movie is also very high .You will go back to it from time to time.All in all a solid 10/10.Enjoy without reservations...",

Audrey Tautou is like one with Amelie after watching her performance as Amelia whenever i see her it is like she is Amelie and not Audrey it is like they have become one in my mind. Amelie will always be on top of my movie suggestions.",
886,26 June 2013,rachelandfilms,9, Wonderful and charming - pure perfection in film form...,"The actual story is a simple one in the plain light of day, yet it is told in such a fabulous and complex way that you get caught up in the many narratives that evolve from Amélie's tale. Amélie is a quiet girl living a life of seclusion in her one bedroom flat with a bunch of neighbours whose lives she finds herself entangled in rather unwittingly. It is because of this that many of our charming subplots are borne and as Amélie endeavours to improve these lives and the lives of her co-workers she finds herself caught up in a romantic journey which will have you believing in true love. I would defy even the biggest cynic to come away from this movie without that fluttery little feeling making itself known in your stomach. Don't get me wrong though, this film doesn't portray love as something utterly perfect. There is no naiveté in the narrative, though there might be some in its main character played by the almost-too-perfect-to-be-real Audrey Tatou. ",
887,5 September 2006,inquirer,10, Like Paris: Outstanding among the beautiful...,"It's been a long time since a movie has satisfied both the issue and the city it was filmed in (especially if this city is Paris). Amélie certainly did. Watching it is like moonily gazing the sun go down from high upon Montmartre. In this dark yellow glow everything seems to be a bit fairer (in all its meanings). This is exactly the feeling i had while watching credits. This is a wonderful example of how much more weight a movie can carry by being well thought out than by devouring a vast budget (Amelie's was only about 13 million $). Everything from the acuteness the characters are elaborated with to the small details that keep occurring throughout the movie seems to fit quite perfect. So if you happen to see this one in your local video store. Go for it and make yourself a wonderful evening, on your own or with someone you really like ;-)",

But this.... this film touched something so familiar in me. Anyone who has fallen in love with Paris, anyone who is a dreamer, anyone who has known true loneliness and detachment from the daily world we live in: you will love it and you will want to live it. I even love the soundtrack. I see the beauty in the film, because I recognize the characters and the way Amelie views life around her. Depending on whether or not you have the dreamer inside you: you will be enchanted, or it will leave you cold (Dutch expression). As for the dreamers: get a bottle of French wine, keep the remote handy (if you don't speak French you will be re-playing like mad, as the visuals sometimes make you forget to read the subs), lie back on the couch, and dive into Paris, romance and the funny things that add up to what we all know as: life.",

910,14 March 2013,reddevil_42,9, The gnome that travelled far and away,"Having watched Barfi recently, it was hard to not see the similarities between the two movies in the way the soundtrack has been used and the depiction of some serious incidents in a lighter way. It was one of those sweet movies where you don't want anything bad to happen to the protagonist because he/she means no harm. It is essentially a movie about an introverted girl who is unlike others her same age. Set on the path to do good for others, she goes about fixing problems around her and in the process meets someone like her. The whole cat and mouse game between Amelie and Nino was very enjoyable. It got me thinking about how people are identified by their peculiarities and oddities more than what they do for a living or are like usually. It is a sugar coated story with a very adorable protagonist that one cannot dislike even if he/she tries to. Usually such movies don't resonate that strongly with me and I put them in the category of ""Cute and sweet"" without giving much thought to them. It is a tough world out there and that is why I find it tough to just flow with the impractical romanticism associated with such movies. There are just so many insecurities that manifest themselves in the real world in our thoughts, which is why the only such movies that I probably enjoy are the ones with loads of dialogue, like Woody Allen's, in which a neurotic protagonist ensures that all his insecurities are out there. How I would love to forget all issues that plague me and enjoy a love story vicariously but it's just not possible to do so without feeling rather sad and lonesome at the end of it. But then, I look hopefully towards the near future. Hopefully, next time I watch this movie, I will approve of the sugar coated texture of it. Right now, the purity and naivety of the characters was something I could not appreciate wholeheartedly. Great soundtrack.",

Heavy on the romance, but it's bearable. The only problem with having to follow the subtitles, is that they probably led me to miss some of the many clever visuals.

Jean-Pierre Jeunet, once again, masters in bringing to life and sharing with us one of his surrealistic world. After Alien4, the city of the lost child or Delicatessen, one may be confused with the almost 'realistic' atmosphere of Amelie.. but don't be mistaken: the neighbours of Amelie, although human-like looking, are closer to fantasy characters than real human. Amelie should be watched as a complicated, entertaining, artistically designed jigsaw which integrity can only be fully perceived at the end of the movie. Actors are fantastic... All of them play their role with conviction and add their personal touch to Amelie's world. Dominique Pinon is truly exasperating as a maniac-jealous guy, Matthieu Kassovitz proves that besides his directing skills he can also be a wonderful actor, the destiny of Audrey Tautou will surely be as fabulous as Amelie's one...

The rest of this comment is based on the hot topic of Captain Planet. Captain Planet is quite possibly the worst super hero of all time whose kryptonite is pollution.

This woman is so weird that the only chance she would have at finding true love is either a dark alley or a mental ward. The actual cinematography was good as the picture was appealing to the eye but I absolutely loath this movie. BTW, who the hell is calling this a fantasy? This movie isn't fantasy in fact most of the movies they are calling fantasy are NOT I repeat are NOT fantasy. Whoever made this list needs fired because they have no understanding of classification and have poor judgment skills. I can think of a way better fantasy list than the one they have provided. Ground hog day? Really? And what is the deal with all the animation movies they should be in their own category. Star Wars was Science fiction and the best of all time in that genre.

This film is a deep character study on a character who is very very lonely & lovely and holds the camera lens in her vice-like grip.  The film is good-natured and kind, although unsparing in its spotlight on the soul's search for its own humanity.

The colour scheme is lovely. I am a huge reader and subtitles make a film all the more interactive and fun for me - give me something to do. There are so many hilarious scenes and so many sad scenes. You really go through a gamete of emotions with this film. The soundtrack is in my incredibly biased opinion, the best I've ever heard. I listen to it regularly.

As someone who speaks no French, it was difficult to keep up the the pace at which the dialogue was spoken. Be ready to read quick. I would even suggest viewing on a computer rather than a television so that pausing is made easier.

From set design to plot to the characters themselves, things were just 'off', but in the most captivating and dazzling way. When I heard of this movie, I knew from the very beginning that I was in for a real treat; that no way would I be disappointed. There was no doubt that I would love this movie. And I did. Granted ""Amélie"" was much more upbeat than either of the aforementioned (darker) movies, but Jeunet's lovable eccentricity is woven into the film nonetheless. I am waiting (im)patiently for his next gem of a movie. If you want a wonderfully uplifing movie that will move you and make you laugh, rent this film. Hell, rent it no matter what. I guarantee you'll love ""Amélie"".",

Camera movement certainly contributes its part to the atmosphere. Balanced and unbalanced pictures contribute to the message of each shot. Right in the beginning when Amélie's mother is introduced, the picture is balanced symbolizing her pursuit for correctness and cleanliness. The same can be about the first shots of Amélie's father. When talking about his dislikes, the shots are unbalanced. But more impressing are some camera movements. For example there is an astonishing high angle shot of Amélie flipping stones on le canal in Paris. The camera shows her leaning on a fence, flying above her head then craning to a low angle shot to show her flipping stones in the direction of the camera. Another one worth mentioning might be the chase of the repairs person. Nino is shown falling up the steps chasing the repairs person for the photo machines. The camera turns to show the man getting in the car driving off. Still in a low angle Nino starts his moped, trying to follow the worker, almost hitting a car.",

The film flows gently from start to finish, never too fast, never too slow, never losing its way, never becoming self-indulgent or melodramatic. It is a simple story of a young girl finding love and along the way (and like an unseen angel) helping others including those who watch this film find their own happiness and contentment. Audrey Tautou is perfect in her role, wide eyed, innocent, whimsical, vulnerable her ability to carry this film along with her performance is amazing. If she was only to ever make one film this would be the one film to make. Watching Ameilie will provide a lift for even the most cynical of hearts, it works for me every time.",

Captivating music, a beautiful heroine, a slightly strange plot - it's all just charming! I love this film for lightness and airiness, for French charm and magical music, charming eccentricities and strange deeds. This film is a kind of anti-depressant. One of those after watching which you want to live, smile, give happiness to others ... I recommend watching it under the divine taste of hot chocolate and croissants. It doesn't take special effects, a huge budget, famous actors, or a brilliant idea to make a decent movie. Sometimes it's enough just to bring ordinary stories to the screen and add a touch of magic. Jean-Pierre Jeunet did it brilliantly and shot one of the most romantic and original films, rightfully considered a masterpiece of world cinema.

Coming from my long time favorite director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who is separated from Caro, and the difference shows.  This movie indeed can not be compared to the previous works of Jeunet, because it is an entirely different movie altogether.  It includes all the tiny details of Jeunet's precise ideas, and creates an amazing story of passion, love, and sex, though as three different things.  Amélie herself is terribly captivating and amusing as she carefully and meticulously tracks down her, as you may call it, soulmate, although I think she would have an entirely other word for it.  But make no mistake, this is no simple love story.  It is amazingly clever and exciting, and very very funny.  Of course, don't watch it expecting another City of Lost Children, it is far from the dark, hidden worlds of the hidden lair of the dreamless genius.  To the contrary everything is open for all to see, and there are no secrets here.  And so, to take the easy way out, I can say no more but see it yourself.",

976,18 January 2008,curious_student,10, The most wonderful movie I've ever seen!,"Amélie is a movie of superlatives. It is the most powerful, moving and adorable film I have ever seen. So let me tell you how this film became my favorite of all-time: On one side, the actors fit perfectly into the image of the city of love: Paris. They are created for a non-existing dream world, where every single person has its place and love is around everywhere. On the other side, France's elementary culture subliminally manifests throughout the whole film. It is maybe just because of this fact that the movie abstains from the image of the modern city of Paris, which could eventually have destroyed the film's charisma. The viewer is somehow guided into several parallel worlds like the Montmartre café ""Deux Moulins"", the trains of thoughts by Amélie or a world of an ill man, the ""glass-bone man"". If you expect the movie to be made out of silk, then you are certainly on the wrong track. Amélie, who has never experienced luck and happiness in her life because her mother died when she was a little child, grows to an angelic figure over the time, trying to solve little grievances in the everyday life of other people. With sophisticated pranks against the mean ones and the support for the socially weak she achieves her aims to make world a better place. Her only problem is that she forgets to care about herself and her own life. She is not able to establish a real relationship because she is always forced to help others. On one day she gets to know her neighbor in the apartment house, the ""glass-bone"" man. He is one of the socially weak because he cannot leave his flat without the danger of breaking his bones. His everyday activity is to copy masterworks and to treat the stories of people he discovers in the paintings. It is him who helps Amélie breaking out and to work up the courage to meet a man she saw at the metro station and with whom she fell in love. Amélie is finally rewarded for all her efforts and justice takes its course...",
977,7 January 2019,oleobueno,8, A different movie that worked pretty well,"It's very well directed, the editing gets you going and it's very artistic with a funny/cute plot. The director is always using strong colors all over the places. Although it's not the movie style I love, I still have to recognize it's a pretty good movie.",
978,8 January 2002,praagsigaar,9," original story, great direction","Although in a way a simple love story the story in itself is very original. As before in Delicatessen and City of the Lost Children the art direction and cinematography are again briliant, but this time not distracting from the emotions of the story. Finally a true great movie in the day and age!",
979,12 April 2022,skirklandnc,10, My favorite movie,"This is my go-to movie. Love everything about it- casting, plot, aesthetics. It's a feel good story that always lifts the mood and is a reminder to 'do good' and treasure the little things.",
980,24 November 2021,florin2q,9, Nice.,"The colors make you feel comfortable and warm. The plot, the shots, the editing gets you. A year passed since I saw it and as I'm trying to recall it I'm already giggling. It left me with a real sense of wholesomeness and beautiful hope for the world. Quite the pleasure to watch.",
981,23 February 2002,shailen,8, Wish I knew french,"um...wish I new more french, because I didnt get the whole story (well the finer details of it) However, it is still darn good...make sure you watch this one and Lagaan (the other internation movie nominated for an Oscar)...make you wonder what is wrong with Hollywood....all the good movies (with good plot lines) are international",
982,1 March 2005,santi_014,10, Its a movie to fall-in-love with.,"The most beautiful cinematography joined in harmony with a wonderful development of the main character. It is a movie to fall-in-love with. From the beginning till the end, the characters domain the scene beyond any picture enchantment or special effect. The love of the filmmaker for the main character makes you step on the point of view of the insanity that it is caused because of this love. The description of this world its very close to the existentialism and reminds me that the beauty of life is in the very own details of every single one of us. But pay attention, this is not the case of a naive or extra-optimistic picture, on the contrary, it teaches to all of us that love as the engine that moves everything creates a positive reaction despite off the bad or negative aspects. The images created by lights off green and red creates a warm environment were the loneliness of our main character is not even perceived as bad, in a world were we cant be alone for an instant. But this is the line, this is the space were the director sits and starts to twist and twist. He presents us a love story, between Amelie and us.",
983,28 September 2003,C2FThom,10," Heartwarming and enchanting, but enlightening as well...","It's easy to see why so many people like Amélie.  The film is absolutely beautiful, and as has been noted time and again, it plays like a modern day fairy tale.  It seems, though, that some people can't understand how it's made its place at #20 in the IMDb's top films list.  So, rather than discuss the general merits of the film, as many have done, I'm going to try and address the reasons, in specific, it's reached this level of popularity.",
984,20 March 2002,murphyspm,10, Best Ever,"I've seen maybe two movies a week for close to thirty years and prefer action adventure, Si-Fi, and ""who done it"" movies. Having said that, nothing has captured my attention and heart like Amelie. If this movie rates a 10 out of 10, and it does, then the next best is maybe a 3. Audrey Tautou as Amelie is an 11. You HAVE to see it.",
985,26 March 2002,succhi74,9, All Hollywood should hide in front of Amélie,"I'd been trying for a long time to get out of the cinema happier than I got in: I was persuaded it was quite impossible, until I saw this wonderful great movie! Amélie is the paladin of the weak, the outcast, the people considered different and therefore outcast, she represents the victory of David against Goliath, of the good against the evil, of the weak against the strong, etc.",
986,9 February 2003,Evil Bob,10," One of, if not, the best film i have seen","It's hard for me to describe how much I love this film. Absolutely everything is perfect about it. It's set in my favourite city in the world and manages to make it look even more beautiful than it actually is. The cinematography is absolutely amazing. The most stunning shot i have ever seen in a film is the one where Amelie skims stones along the canal where the camera goes right over her head and the whole screen virtually explodes in a cascade of colour. The plot is a universally pleasing one. ""Cute hippy girl tries to make the world a better place by making people happy, and in turn finds happiness herself"" and what the hell is wrong with that?",
