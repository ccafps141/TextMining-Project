3,3 November 2021,cs_rahul_kumar,10," Suriya's Jai Bhim Deserves To Get An Oscar Award For The Best Movie, And Suriya Deserves To Get The Best Actor Award !!!","In a scene in Jai Bhim, a group of tribals man meet a police office who is heading an inquiry commission about the disappearance of three missing tribals who were being interrogated by the police about a theft case. One man tells him that he was once arrested by cops just for greeting them. Another tells him about how he was arrested just because he tried to slink away fearing them. A woman narrates how her husband was forced to 'confess' to a crime which he had not committed after the cops started molesting her. A young boy mentions that the police picked him up just because they could not get his father, and how that one incident made him a perennial suspect at school.

7,9 November 2021,classicsoncall,8," ""It will be quite an uphill battle.""","There's some serious upvoting for this film here on IMDb; if not for a weighted averaging of the film's rating by viewers, this would be the number one movie of all time having just come out this year, and that by a wide margin. I thought the movie was good for it's portrayal of corrupt authorities taken down by a dedicated attorney, it hit on many of the points that social justice advocates clamor for here in this country. Based on a true story, one can only marvel at the dedication of a man like Chandru (Suriya), who utilized every bit of means and cunning to humiliate the brutal police authorities and their corrupt political allies. Many times it's a difficult story to watch, as the beatings and punishment doled out by district police against members of lower castes approach grotesquely inhumane treatment. Chandru's efforts eventually pay off, and it was inspiring to see him honored by the citizens he represented at the finale, reminiscent of that final scene of Gregory Peck in ""To Kill A Mockingbird"".",/

Suriya brings another firebrand performance after SP, and delivers with his impeccable dialogue delivery and mannerism. I'm glad they didn't add any unnecessary mass/commercial scenes just because it is a Suriya film, and even the songs went along with the story instead destroying the pace.

In the era of SQUID GAME and Suryavanshi fantasies, we need such real life stories. I feel so much guilty that we are still carrying the burden of this 2500 years old rotten caste system where our fellow human beings are still treated worse than animals. As if the actors have not acted, it feels like I am watching CCTV footage! There is minimal heroism, maximum expression. There is not much court room drama, still the pace of the story is intense. The police and system which were supposed to protect us, provide everybody equal rights for survival, in reality literally killing people based on their surnames!!! :-( This movie based on a real life story on tribal rights made me sad, this movie made me hopeful too!

In the film, he is more of a tool that helps enact justice for the oppressed victims. There's no showy entry, songs that praise him to the skies, or stock heroines who exist only to admire him. Instead, the film focuses more on the tribal characters played by Manikandan and Lijomol (both excellent) and the series of unfortunate events that they go through.",

111,17 November 2021,samabc-31952,8, Casteism does exist in 21st century India...,"There are 36 tribes in TamilNadu. Most from these tribes depend on agriculture, forests and cultivation for their livelihood. This is a story of 4 who belong to one such tribe who work for upper caste in rat infestation control and catching snakes in their homes. The oppressor and the oppressed... a habeas corpus case... court drama ... movie does succeed in portraying a heinous gruesome picture of the atrocities and systematic violence that are being committed by the police, the upper caste, the justice system and the government against these tribes. A bitter reality... in last 5 years In the last five years, a total of 300 caste-related murders have been reported in Tamil Nadu and most victims were Dalits. At least two Dalits are assaulted every hour in 21st-century India, and every day, three Dalit women are raped, two Dalits are murdered and two Dalit homes are torched on average. Over 200 million Dalits, who comprise nearly 17% of India's population, face the threat of such violence daily (Ref: Wire)
The apotheosis of the protagonist and few unnecessary jail sequences however takes away the focus from the underlying tribal issue .. but it does not fail to deliver a strong message and demands one to introspect.. thought provoking, based on true story .. Surya brings the perception in story telling to an 'unfortunately a truism' .. a great watch ..",

Very well written and directed. Perfect casting for every role, hats off for the casting director for casting such amazing indigenous actors for each role. I don't even want to talk about acting performances because I don't think I'm quite qualified to talk about it. Suriya sir did it again after Soorarai Pottru and supporting cast deserves a special mention, TBH, they performed better than most bollywood actors. Indian cinema deserves more movies like this.

The ones belonging to the segment which has superliked this innocuously immature movie and are championing it to be a messiah of their lost ideology and those who are considering this as a threat to their existence. It has a rating of 9.6 on IMDB and yet to come in the top 250 list of the database provided by the site even after securing nearly 56k votes when this review is being written, a proof of the fact that something is wrong with the metrics and the effervescent rating will overcome the emotional doldrums and will stabilize soon after the initial emotions doze off. This shows how people belonging to any particular political ideology have strongly voted in favor of this movie. On the other hand, the way this movie is being slammed by some so called 'Film Pundits' or the 'Protectors of the nation' on several social media platforms show their unnecessary fear of losing their propaganda politics for a mere movie. The real metrics of IMDB will come into action when the initial zeal will die off from both the parties. Wait till that day to be too biased by any judgmental review.",

But this movie was made with unwanted controversies. Movie is based on real incident... fine, then show as it happened why you change the religion? The movie tried to portray discrimination experienced by the unprivileged class of society... It's a good thought. But in the real incident (based which this movie was made) the sub inspector was a Christian but in the movie his character was modified into an upper caste man. Why Anthony Das becomes Guru here? All other main character names are retained. The original characters have been intentionally replaced to target specific communities who are against the Surya's favorite Ruling party. Only because their minority appeasement will come to stake or there will be a question mark on their so called secularism ideology. The moment I saw Periyar (person who was believed to fight against discrimination, but filled with hatred towards hindu traditions) I was disgusted.

Granted this is a common happenstance and the story is predictable. But the point of the movie is to get you engage with the characters and see the world from their perspective.

Jai Bhim is more of an educational film that needs to be seen by everyone. Jai Bhim shows us a reality that we conveniently ignore and overlook, because it's too ugly and depressing, and we just want beauty and positivity in our life. We are fed with movies like Sooryavanshi, where policemen have superhuman abilities and are always acting in the best interests of the people, but the true picture is very different from the one shown to us by the likes of Rohit Shetty. We as human beings do not believe in the concept of ""always punch up"", we derive pleasure out of exploiting the poor, weak and the downtrodden. We have turned ourselves into the monsters that we used to read about in the fairytales as kids. 'Jai Bhim' shows us the mirror that we just don't have the courage to look into.",

323,3 November 2021,ardilazufir,10, Possibly the best movie that came out in 2021,A very good film that highlights a very big problem that still exists today. Police (and the government) brutality VS native tribal people who are powerless. I have to say that every character in this film gave a very good performance. It's 165 mins long but there is no waste scenes and I was watching this with full focus.,
324,18 June 2022,briancham1994,8, Brutal (perhaps too brutal) legal drama,"The strength of this film lies in its evocative performances and direct portrayal of its subject matter. When covering the issue of caste discrimination, it does not shy away from all the horrific ways the authorities inflict injustice on the tribal group. Throughout the film, they exist to the police only as useful scapegoats to inflate their arrest records as they don't have the wealth or social status to defend themselves. This is all portrayed in a tense and brutal way as the actors always show they are in constant anguish and it never shies away from direct violence (which got too much at times). It strikes a fine balance between cynicism and hope, as embodied by the main lawyer character who is a reluctant hero and is pessimistic about the missing men but is defiant enough to try to find them anyway. My main concern with the film was the odd editing as time skips around a lot in very confusing ways, especially when there are so many characters.",

Perumalsami: ""It is true that in order to uphold democracy, someone from some era has to become a dictator.""
In such movies, there are always many scenes and shots that make people angry and shudder. Those in power ignore life as a matter of course. It is like a routine abuse of violence. The direct lens is even more intuitive than the horror film.

I am no supporter of any discrimination.

But in the real incident (based which this movie was made) the sub inspector was a Christian but in the movie his character was modified into an upper caste man. Why Anthony Das becomes Guru here? All other main character names are retained. The original characters have been intentionally replaced to target specific communities who are against the Surya's favorite Ruling party. Only because their minority appeasement will come to stake or there will be a question mark on their so called secularism ideology. The moment I saw Periyar (person who was believed to fight against discrimination, but filled with hatred towards hindu traditions) I was disgusted. This movie is made to create hate towards certain communities which was unnecessary.",

On one hand the presence of a big star like Surya would inevitably lead to certain ""mass"" scenes which might bother the emotional flow and on the other hand his presence would also bring in tons of audience to this film that is addressing an important issue. Jai Bhim is about a horrific real incident that happened in the 90's but the problem it's addressing is as relevant today as it was back then. The initial portions of the film where we see the life of Irulars are amazing. We get to know them, their lifestyle and, most importantly, how they're treated. Then the film segues into the real issue. I wish the film had been treated like Visaranai. This movie is just a bit too commercial for such a sensitive topic but i get it, a film like Visaranai would never reach as many people as this has. Anyways this is a very important film about casteism, social injustice and police brutality.",

1225,8 November 2021,taxfreeknight,8, A good movie with plenty of noise pollution .,"As with most good South movie , it is spoiled by too many unwanted noises created by the casts . I found it unbearably irritating the way the women in the movie , especially the wife of the victim cries in every scene unnecessarily. Tears are effective on screen when they are shown only when necessary , making it occur every second scene , combined with lots of wailing and bawling , just diminishes its effectiveness in garnering sympathy . If fact every time she started wailing I hoped the cop would shut her up . Maybe, it's only in the Hindi dubbed version that all these unnecessary loud noises are shown and not in its original format. But all the same a good movie was ruined by some very unwanted overacting by its female casts and a few male cast as well , like the short guy in the lock up as well as in the end at the court .what any guy in court would have given his statement in a normal and controlled manner , this fellow was overflowing with mile long tears and wailing with more unwanted noises .When he was doing his teary acts , I so wanted the cop or anyone in the movie to just kill him too , just to shut his bawling .It was that unbearable. Why couldn't the director make it more realistic and less melodramatic like rest of the movie ? Would have been well deserving the fantastic IMBD ratings had it not been for these stupid melodramas and sound pollutions . Having said that , the movie was an out an out entertaining movie and thoroughly captivating .",

For more than 3000 years now this has been going on and no one has risen up against this modern Indian slavery. America got divided to fight slavery.

Surya and director has done an absolutely amazing job in making this movie and bring awareness to the so-called freedom and equality. Upcoming movies should come up with society's burning issues like this and bring awareness to the younger generation. I am not sure why anyone would rate below 10, if they happen to do it, I am pretty sure something is wrong with the way they have been brought up.

A tight slap by the policeman to the criminal that blabbers arrogantly in Hindi when asked questions in Tamil (although he's well versed in Tamil), despite being the cunning creature engaging in everything illegal was absolutely befitting and not too fantastic to be real! To mainain such momentum despite such a serious and subject is indeed commendable!

1552,3 November 2021,kinderjeet,10, Best movie on casteism and police brutality,I have no words to describe how great this movie is. Though this movie is in telugu but police brutality and casteism remains same no matter in which state that brutality took place. We live in so called 21st century but nothing has changed neither the police brutality nor the casteism. The upper caste still enjoys privileges of being part of that caste and lower caste / tribals bears the harassment from upper caste plus the society. The movie is an eye opener on the casteism that still exists in our fake modern society. This country still need honest lawyers who believes in standing up for those who are denied justice and standing against who misuses the power and law. About the slapping scene where police officer slapped the person to speak in tamil I couldn't find anything offensive. Everyone is proud of their mother language and one should remember hindi is not a national language so dont impose it on everyone. Don't ruin the rational behind the movie over just one scene. The movie shows us the horrible state of this society upper caste lower caste and of course the police brutality no doubt why I still hate police so much.,

Please watch the movie and know how old generation treated people who they think as low grade,"The screenplay the script has scenes that are required and necessary. The way it was projected to showcase the true story that happened 26 years before is pretty awesome. Everybody's acting is treat to your eyes. Sengeni character in the movie brings tears every time she appears in search of the truth behind her husband missing. Chandru as a lawyer does anything and everything legally to bring justice to Sengeni. His expressions speak. Climax scene emotions and expressions by Chandru character is awesome and makes you feel the same way he feels. Characters represented as higher grade people treat Rasakannu and Sengeni and their people very bad as if they are untouchables and low grade people. Even when they know these people are good, they won't help them or save them from Police. Lawyers who support villains have done the given job and executed it well. We get angry on why such lawyers even exist helping wrong people and encouraging them to do more. Treat every man and woman from any caste equally. Have heart and treat everybody with humanity. If people we start respecting everybody and treating others with humanity and helping needy people by means of education and employment, each and every family will definitely raise their status from Poverty to at least middle class eventually someday. I request everybody who reads my review to help somebody in need by any means you can help.",

1825,17 November 2021,rikzinc,10, More mainstream movies like this!,"While I cannot deny the fact that the movie has been treated in a little unrealistic manner the way mainstream movies does to heighten the impact of the story. Some may cringe, some may whistle. I did wish that it was treated in a matter of fact way, but, I am extremely satisfied thinking that it reaches a larger audience with the kind of treatment it has been given and with the start power of Suriya. Now, when I say star power, I would highly appreciate if many of our stars used their power to bring in stories like this that would actually contribute to the awareness and therefore, progress of the society instead of indulging in no-brainer movies all the time. Of course, one can enjoy it, but when you have such a huge influence on people, why not use it for good? Coming to the movie, despite the minor issue, by and large, I extremely loved it. One can't deny that it makes you think and introspect. The title of movie sounded gimmicky to me initially but by the time the end credits started rolling, I found myself guilty for thinking so. The subtle tribute it gives to the father of the Indian constitution is very well deserved. Of course, such success stories are far and wide from one to the other, but it gives us hope that judiciary wasn't given that extra independence for nothing. For the marginalized section of the society, where even the Government treats them like outsiders in many cases, they have got no one but the judiciary to look up to for protection. It's sad that such cases are very rare. India, by large, hasn't been able to achieve the kind of progress despite all the infrastructural, technological and what not progress that we have achieved over the years, simply because the very foundation of our society is still based on malice, discrimination, prejudice. Where one would openly protest against reservation but would hesitate to speak up for the rights of minorities, it is a clear indication of the fact that we still haven't come out from the clutches of the evils that plagued our society centuries ago. I personally believe that, before the government or judiciary or for that matter, even the constitution, it is extremely important for each and every individual to bring progress within their mindset and conscience. That, in itself would be the start to a progressive environment. This is something I seriously want people to discuss and consider it important. There are many movies based on similar subject, but I recommend you all to watch this wonderful movie. It will definitely make you think.",

1840,28 August 2022,JackSparroww,8," Don't even think twice, just watch it!","Movie begins with the story of tribals from a backward village. It depicts the real challenges faced by the tribals to make their ends meet. The main focus of the movie is on false theft case against Rajakunnu(brilliantly played) and his two friends. Later in the first half, it is marked by the heroic entry of Adv Chandru who fights for the justice and truth. He has played his role superbly, even you can feel his rhetoric in the movie. I really enjoyed some of his punch lines ""We can see Gandhi and Nehru but we can't find Bhim"". Sengeni, who was wife of Rajakunnu has also played her role brilliantly. At the end of the movie, Sengeni tries to give her Mangal Sutra to Adv Chandra as the fees of her case but he refuses to take it by asking her what if someone would have come to you with agony of snake's bite. Would you not save their life if they were not able to pay you the money. I am really sorry at this point as I have missed a point, this tribe was expert at saving people's life from the snake's bite. This scene is heart melting and you can feel it. Now why am I deducting two stars, the reason is torture performed by the police will give you goosebumps. But in my opinion this has been exaggerated to seek more attention from the audience.

Lighting was great to match the situations as well as camera angling. For example, low key lighting to match the intense or violent sequences. Dialogue was perfect as there weren't really any cliches of any sort and they hit hard as well. The sound direction was phenomenal. Performances were outstanding. This movie had a good theme as well and how they portray that on screen with their technical aspects was great for making the audience to sympathize with the characters. Whether people agree with the message or not, the movie did an amazing job of calling attention to the marginalized communities and promoting change. It also emphasized the importance of finding truth and restoring faith in the justice system when it fails the people. Those are some of the most important things that we have to open our minds for to this day. Now while the movie isn't 100% accurate accordingly to the true events, we have to remember that is a story constructed based off true events. Its message is basically to let us know that these kinds of atrocities are happening and that we should try to prevent it from happening again. We should focus on the message that they portray through onscreen elements and judge the movie accordingly to that. Overall, great work by the crew!",
