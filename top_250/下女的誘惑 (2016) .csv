But even with these excellent films I can always find a spot that doesn't quite sit right with me. With The Handmaiden, it is perfect; every frame handcrafted to perfection. Even with 4min of explicit sex taken away by my country's dumb censors, this is still perfect every way I see it.",/
1,5 August 2016,tenshi_ippikiookami,10, Just amazing,"""The Handmaiden"" is a crazily imaginative and beautiful movie by Chan-wook Park, who is at the top of his game in this story of a pickpocket that tries to steal the fortune of a naive, innocent rich woman that has been secluded in a mansion in the middle of nowhere.

Hideko is supported by her Uncle Kouzuki (Jin-woong Jo) and the gold-digger ""Count Fujiwara"" (Jung-woo Ha), who is indeed son of peasants, wants to marry her to steal her inheritance. Sook-Hee is a small-time thief of the ring of the conman ""Count Fujiwara"" and is sent to help him in the confidence game. But soon Hideko and Sook- Hee get close to each other and become lovers. But Sook-Hee is pressed by Fujiwara to betray her friend. When Fujiwara marries Hideko, they go with Sook-Hee to an asylum and the nurses hold Sook- Hee believing that she is Hideko. Why Hideko poses of servant and leaves Sook-Hee in the asylum to stay with Count Fujiwara?",e
3,20 November 2016,Quinoa1984,8, will need a 2nd viewing. I mean that as a compliment (mostly),"The Handmaiden is a film that unfolds with a classic film stylist (in particular I felt like Chanwook Park was in a kind of Brian De Palma mode as far as making an erotic dramatic-thriller with a camera that luxuriates in long shots, elaborate camera movements, and cinematic grammar that emphasizes operatic intentions, though it's maybe not the first time he's done this anyway), and is LOADED with story. What appears to be the story of a handmaiden who is put in as part of a long con by a man who wants to steal this wealthy woman's money is actually a story about storytelling, about weaving a pack of lies and an entire personality and, in reality, how that can start to crack apart when it comes to seeing humanity in another person and their vulnerabilities.",v

5,16 October 2016,videorama-759-859391,8, You gotta hand it to Park Chan-wook,"The Handmaiden is a beautifully told story in a beautifully shot film. Some of it's chosen exterior locations are so captivating and mesmerizing, you almost feel you're there, or wish you were. The actresses are beautiful and perform nothing short of excellent, the young girl (The Handmaiden) especially, such a professionally acted job. You'd expect more so sex scenes, that kind of left me a little downtrodden. The major lesbian one, amidst only a couple of others, in this near two and half hour piece, is one of the hottest and most explicit, I've ever seen, this one again, beautifully shot. The story involves a young girl, a new handmaiden, forced to defraud the wife of the husband, only the young girl falls for the wife, where the story kind of manipulates you, as to where the girl's intentions will lead, where revenge is thrown in too, as we go back in time to an earlier period, involving our young girl, and the wife, where we find ourselves returning to some old scenes, but with added stuff- purpose here. This is one you'd have to watch a couple of times to get the complete picture. Didn't understand the change in color of the subtitles, my only qualm. Acting by all is top notch, and our handmaiden is definitely something to ogle at. A handmaiden who's beautifully made. We too have some violence, and some humorous moments. Hopefully this film will command more attention from moviegoers in Adelaide, as here's one faultless cinematic experience, you should experience, and by no accounts, miss, as it will be your loss. The most impressive thing here though, above everything else here is the filming/photography from obviously a very talented photographer.",e

Rarely does the film fully meet those expectations, but when it does it is something special. Such is the case with Park Chan-wook's The Handmaiden (Mademoiselle).

That's true, but the movie is more. It addresses relationships and abuse. Very well, I might add. I'm not sure how much of it I can describe without giving a lot away. I can just say that you have probably never seen anything like this. There's plenty of sex, but none of it gratuitous.",/

Set in the 1930s Japanese occupied Korea, it's a story of a young female pickpocket (Kim Tae-ri) who becomes a handmaiden to a beautiful Japanese heiress (Min-hee Kim).

It's certainly visually and thematically rich and provocative as it slides between frequently explicit romance, comedy and horror: if in part it aims to shock, it certainly does so in style. However, I struggled to like any of the characters, all of whom seem as selfish and ruthless as each other, and felt no especial sympathy for the female leads simply because they happen to fall in love/list for each other. The film should perhaps be seen as a paean to desire, in all its oddness and intensity. But for all the artistry, I never quite escaped the feeling of a tale told by schoolchildren, snickering behind the bikesheds.",0

Night Shyamalan too (I always have to think if I wrote that correctly - would be nice if imdb had a feature where it recognized names and helped one out). The story and its pace are fairly easy and slow to follow. There is nudity and adult situations (not sure if they are cut in the theatrical release), but that is not something that should be disturbing the viewer at all. If it does, maybe the movie is not something you should watch (or read up on if there is less nudity in the other cut).",4

24,30 March 2018,classicsoncall,7," ""My job is to look after the Lady.""","Had this remained a revenge movie with a twist I would have appreciated it a lot better. But then it enters lesbian soft porn territory and the movie takes on an entirely different tone. I can just imagine what theater movie goers must have gone through when the love scenes between Lady Hideko (Min-hee Kim) and Sook-hee (Tae-ri Kim) took center stage. When you're not ready or prepared for it, the sex scenes can inadvertently turn a promising night out into a virtual catastrophe. The story could have been told without the explicit sex and perhaps might have been more enthralling if the affair between the Japanese heir and her Korean handmaiden been more nuanced and suggestive. I didn't particularly care for director Chan-wook Park's ""Oldboy"" either. He has a visually captivating style but his choice of subject matter ought to come with a viewer discretion warning.",t
25,26 June 2020,dromasca,9," beautiful, bold, captivating","I have noticed on other occasions that many of the Korean films refuse easy categorizations. This is also the case of 'The Handmaiden', the film made in 2016 by Chan-wook Park. It is a mature film, a film that starts from an English horror-Gothic style novel, moves the action in Korea occupied by Japan in the 30s of the last century, and develops into a synthesis of psychological and erotic thrillers with family saga and social cinema with a strong feminist touch. The personal imprint is very visible, the director that 'Oldboy' made famous in the world manages once again to tell fluently and with a unique visual perfection a Tarantino style story that takes place in a Japanese Hitchcock setting. I think there will be viewers who are bothered by one or the other of the details and scenes in the film, but I don't think many can escape the magnetic charm of the story put on screen by this Korean master. Yes, master. I think that with this film, Chan-wook Park earned - at least for me - the title of master of the art of film.",t
26,4 November 2019,JakeBrinkman,1, Good story... for a porno,"This movie is essentially just a very well-written pornographic film, and there's no reason for it to be. If you remove the unquestionably excessive scenes, it becomes a thrilling tale of deception and cunning, with dialogue and acting that deeply convinced me the actor's truly felt their characters' emotions. But the continuous bombardment of pornography makes it very clear that director Park had no intentions of making a respectable film. Perhaps his intention was to see if he could persuade critics that an overtly explicit work could somehow be considered art rather than pornography? Whatever his motives may be, I now firmly believe that he is a dirtier old man than the dirty old man in his story, and this movie that had so much potential only leaves me feeling dirty too.",_

29,30 October 2016,clg238,4, Pornography and an Over-the-top Plot,"It's pornography (including sadism) interwoven with an intricate, silly plot--if this intrigues you, fine! I had trouble with the absurd set-up to the film, which is (and feels) way too long because the graphic sex scenes are virtually endless. There are three points-of-view, and the film invariably slips out of POV from time to time. That said, the settings, costumes and cinematography. are absolutely gorgeous, as are the female actors. Except for a twist or two, the film goes nowhere and is about nothing. The Korean and Japanese dialogue (as translated) often sounds like a cross between what one would find in a romance novel and hard-core pornography--breathless, over-the-top, no pretense of being remotely realistic. Nevertheless, the reviews have been extremely positive and the people in the audience when I attended seemed really to like this film--I am hard-pressed to understand why. While the characters in the movie are lusting for each other, and making an all-out effort to titillate viewers, I hunger for a story that has character development and a journey worth traveling.",v

But it thankfully didn't seem to work. It took on a vulgar tone at times as it went too over the top with the sex scenes with an underage looking girl looking right in the camera with her mouth covered in vaginal secretion. They got rid of the man and the uncle got him back and tortured him while he's smoking the poisonous cigarette in the basement where the uncle had also killed the aunt and set it up to make it look like a suicide by hanging. People kept talking about the twist at the end and I can assure you there's no twist whatsoever. Both women tricked each other with the man at first and when his lady wanted to hang herself in the cherry tree, the two united against the man. She got out of the asylum and met the girl who poisoned his drink and made her sleep at the hotel room. That was it.

40,26 February 2018,jboothmillard,6, The Handmaiden,"I was told about this South Korean film, that it was full a risqué material, and then it got some nominations during Awards Season, so I was looking forward to giving it a go, directed by Park Chan-wook (Oldboy, Stoker). Basically set in the 1930s, in Korea during the Japanese occupation, beautiful and fragile Japanese heiress Lady Hideko (Min-hee Kim), lives with her sadistic and despotic uncle Kouzuki (Jin-woong Jo). Uncle Kouzuki is an intellectual and an avid collector of rare erotic literature, he has raised Lady Hideko since the tender age of five, he plans to marry her for her riches. As a result, Lady Hideko has been confined in a large dreary and sun-deprived countryside estate, she is like a caged bird. She also seems to be an easy target for forger and outright con artist Count Fujiwara (Jung-woo Ha), who hires dexterous young pickpocket Sook-hee (Tae-ri Kim) to act as the new handmaiden, as part of the secret plot to defraud her. The Count needs Sook-hee to persuade the unaware noblewoman to marry him, and when the elaborate scam is successful, he will ruthlessly and without any remorse whatsoever, he will send her to an asylum. The con was proceeding according to plan, but Lady Hideko's unparalleled beauty with her long raven hair, luscious scarlet lips and velvety skin is no match for them. The scheme is doomed to fail when Lady Hideko and Sook-hee discover unexpected emotions and a romance develops, and in the end Count Fujiwara realises what's going on, he uses cigarettes laced with mercury to poison Kouzuki, the two women celebrate their freedom, making love. Also starring Hae-sook Kim as Miss Sasaki and So-ri Moon as Aunt of Lady Hideko. The leading actresses give good performances as the heiress and the young swindler who become believable lesbian lovers, and the actor playing the monstrous uncle is good, obviously having to read subtitles it was not easy to concentrate, but I got the general gist. The story was originally based on a book set in Victorian Britain, the new setting is put to good use, the costumes and scenery are marvellous to look at, the psychological thriller style and macabre stuff is interesting, and the love story and sexual scenes are beautifully done, all in all it is an intriguing and worthwhile erotic drama. It won the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language. Good!",

The pace slows and we are rewarded for our early concentration as so much makes so much sense so soon. Not always so with Asian movies, for western audiences, it seems to me. Park has such a wonderful sense of framing and is not afraid to move his cameras in unconventional ways. The sumptuous interiors and exteriors may have the appearance of the equivalent of an English historic romance but here the cameras offer us views and movement more akin to a full on action movie.

This time, I believe ""The Handmaiden"" has conveyed the same feelings, even in a more artistic and unexpected way. The main actresses and actors performs exceptionally well in the movie, especially Kim Min-hee, the beautiful Japanese heiress. When I look into her eyes, I feel like I'm actually a character in the film and slightly feel the same affection for her. On the other hand, Kim Taeri, who plays the role of a female pickpocket also shows a decent acting in the movie. Ha Jung-soo, the count, also plays well and become an indispensable part in building the story lines. The plot twist in the movie is quite unexpected, but it's a happy ending so that's good.

Ah-Ga-Si or The Handmaiden is Carefully and cleverly crafted, beautifully and elegantly detailed tale of betrayal, manipulation,abuse, love and the absence of it, filtered with a captivating,submersible grounded in reality approach utilizing nature to create the perfect atmosphere. This is a Masterpiece to say the least. The Handmaiden, Black Swan and Martyrs are my favorite movies of all time and what all of those have in common is that they all unapologetically embrace the raw, labeled as bad, sexuality, violent aspects of life in their approach to movie making and storytelling and thus creating the most harmonic intellectual portrayal of our primal instincts driving the steering wheel of destiny. This is a tension building, anxiety inducing and yet naively touchingly experience to behold Park chan-wook created. A fantastic piece of art in film form I cannot speak highly enough of.

But more than anything, The Handmaiden is just pure cinema, a dizzying, disturbing fable of love and betrayal that piles on luxurious imagery, while never losing track of its story's human core.

71,31 August 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8, Knocks it out of the (Chan-wook) Park.,"A loose adaptation of 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters, Park Chan-wook's 'The Handmaiden (2016)' is a layered and subversive thriller that very much feels like a novel brought to life. It's a film that knows exactly how to handle its audience, revealing only what it needs to for the current status-quo to be compelling. Its twists and turns come at the exact right moments, leading to a satisfyingly unpredictable experience that only gets deeper with each new revelation. The subject matter is darker than you might initially imagine; it deals with themes of domestic imprisonment, abuse, grooming and pre-video-tape pornography. It's also, even at its core, a romance. The relationship that blossoms between the eponymous handmaiden and her originally eponymous lady (the Korean release is named after the latter) is what fuels the narrative. Much has been made of their graphic yet restrained (though still very 'movie') sex scenes, but it's their budding sensuality and genuine connection that makes the pair believable. They're good, somewhat understated characters that keep you invested in the picture. This adds a layer of emotional resonance to the otherwise plot-heavy affair. The flick just grips you and doesn't let go. It has a palpable texture to it and it takes you on an unexpected journey. It's one of Park's best efforts. 8/10",

Early on we see a wealthy man living in an opulent mansion who is corrupt in that he forges books to sell and wants to marry his niece for her inheritance, and a couple of grifters who want to swindle him in a cruel way that will leave the niece in a madhouse. There is some real darkness here, and this is just the start of it. The film is 145 minutes long but the production value is so high that the time seemed to fly by. It was almost ruined by director Park Chan-wook not exercising the slightest bit of restraint during the sex scenes; it goes from sweet seduction and lesbian empowerment to exploitative soft-core porn as he holds the camera/male gaze on the young actors for far longer than was necessary on more than one occasion.

He is basically the Quentin Tarantino of Korea, where he creates artistic movies that the mainstream audiences can enjoy. I personally thought it was lacking when it came to substance compared to his previous films. I thought that it would delve more into humanity and psychological elements. It does have those elements in this but it didn't intrigue me like it did compared to his previous work. I will say it's different from his previous work. This time around it tries to go in that old fashion film-making style. Now Park Chan-wook's signature brutality, gruesome violence but a bit of black humor is still intact. What drives this movie isn't the subconscious of the human mind and humanity. But it really does uses the cinematography to drive the story forward. The imagery is vivid, vibrant and very detailed. When it comes to Korean cinematography this film is topnotch in that department. It's one of the main factors that kept me focused throughout the whole thing. Park Chan-wook really did master his craft when it comes to shooting his films. Also this is one of the few films I have seen where the sexual innuendos actually moves the story forward.

99,23 December 2016,akash_sebastian,9, A Fiercely Anti-Patriarchal Period Romance Thriller,"Subverting the trope of feminine subservience and the male gaze, Park Chan-Wook's latest thriller is fiercely anti-patriarchal. Inspired from Sarah Waters' contemporary romance novel set in Victorian-era Britain, Park transports his story to 1930's Japanese-occupied Korea. Parallels can be seen between subjugation of women by men and that of Korea by Japan; clash of culture, class and identity. It exposes and condemns the bare-faced misogyny brought upon by class and culture. Being a tale about deception, Park makes sure that we are one of its casualties as well (through its efficient narrative structure); nothing is as it seems. I repeat, 'Nothing'. Each of the four main characters are pursuing a vision of freedom that can be achieved only through a lie; the story explores the tension between the authentic self and the facade that individuals create, and that society imposes from without.",

106,27 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,10," The Handmaiden is sumptuous, provocative and, I can say with confidence, a masterpiece.","I try not to use that word, it's rather overused for films that just aren't masterpieces. But when a film is so gorgeous that it imitates art, so multi-dimensional that it transcends the majority of narratives and so daring that it tests the limitations of film itself...I can't help but call it a masterpiece. A rich Japanese lady recruits a handmaiden who soon turns out to be a swindler, tasked with falsifying a wedding in order to steal her money. Twists and turns soon reveal many secrets that question the legitimacy of the new handmaiden's undercover task. Immediately I was hypnotised. Park Chan-Wook has such an eye for detail, every frame is lovingly crafted and resembles a jewel on a glistening necklace. Cinematography rarely looks this gorgeous, honestly. The visceral imagery conveys multiple themes of lust, greed, jealousy...in fact, nearly all the seven deadly sins are thematically interwoven in this complex narrative. Chan-Wook played me like a puppet. Manipulating my mind with every unexpected twist. It's a story of how powerful love is. An emotion so overwhelming that people are moulded by its presence. The lead characters all experience this, whether it be falsifying love or truly experiencing it for the first time. How motivations for money and power can be blurred by love. It's just a work of art. It truly is. Deceive me once? I applaud you. Deceive me twice? I'm jumping up and down the room like a lunatic. Tiny intricacies that are soon explained within the narrative's three parts, these revelations blew my mind. With an everlasting haunting undertone, it just made the story all the more resonating. Even the musical score was stunning, replicating orchestral symphonies with traditional Asian instruments. I will say it's an 18 for a reason, the sexual nature is extremely explicit yet it doesn't detract from the seamless story. Asian cinema has yet again proven that it's better than Hollywood. The Handmaiden, easily, acquires the perfect rating.",

A good film is supposed to keep its audience engaged, not have the audience thinking about something else, let alone another film. And I guess that's one of the reasons I was reluctant to give it a higher score. I also found myself struggling to enjoy the film within the first 30 minutes. Actually, I was dozing off, yet another not-so-good indicator. The acting of both female leads (or co-leads)was top notch. I couldn't say the same for the 2 male characters, Jung-woo Ha and Jin-woong Jo. I've seen both of them in other films, where they gave much better performances, so I guess it was a question of chemistry or miscasting. Or maybe I was just subconsciously biased because of the intense female sexuality in the plot. Either way, I wasn't convinced by the male characters. On a positive note, the production was impeccable (almost too perfect) and the twist in the story definitely resuscitated my attention halfway through.

It centres around the charming, butter-wouldn't-melt ""Sook-Hee"" (Tae Ri Kim) who takes a job attending the wealthy ""Lady Hideko"" (Kim Min-hee). She lives on a grand estate with her cantankerous uncle ""Kouzuki"" (Cho Jin-woong) and is frankly rather low maintenance for her new maid. Pretty quickly, though, we begin to smell a rat! Is she what she seems, and what has the obviously duplicitous ""Count"" (Ha Jung-woo) got to do with things? Well gradually, we find out that there are schemes afoot to rob the lady of her fortune, her liberty - even her mind. What the plotting didn't take account for, though, was human nature. A bond gradually starts to build between the two women, a bond of friendship, of trust - of love! What happens next...? This benefits hugely from having a tightly-knit cast who work well together; a solid and intriguing story that marries the Machiavelian with the mischievous, the sexy with the sordid - and, it looks great too. The characters vacillate from being likeable, kinky, and often pretty loathsome in equal measure, but somehow there is always a sense that right will be done! I loved the ending, and the performances from the two women are engaging and captivating. Some of it isn't for the squeamish, but it flew by, is expertly crafted, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",

The first act seems a bit slow and straightforwards, but at the end comes the first twist, and from there the wonderful, intricate story unfolds. I am not usually a big fan of romance films because they force the relationship with no real understanding of their perspectives or reasons they care about the other person. In The Handmaiden, the layering of their perspectives by seeing events from one perspective in the first act and another in the second does a fantastic job of showing the way each opens up to this idea, despite their initial plans. The other thing that makes the romance work so well is because of the personal backstories we understand in how up to this point, they have been controlled and used (particularly sexually) by men in their lives. This is particularly poignant for Hideko, but also present for Sookhee in relation to the Count. It's a great story of two women who had turned cold and ruthless due to the way they have been treated by men in their lives, to find each other and regain some passion and joy. I love the way Park structures the story to present a simple set up and then add depth to it as the movie progresses, until by the end we see the full picture and can appreciate the wonderful journey the two women went on.

The crusher plot line was ""inspired by 'Fingersmith,'"" one of Sarah Waters's tales of the lesbian demimonde, and the film kicks off with some vintage romance-novel shtick —a scoundrel's plotting to elope with an heiress, Lady Hideko, and relieve her of her fortune.

Park Chan-yu may not want to discuss the depravity of human nature, but just wants to show his life and have the right to pursue happiness. In essence, this is not a feminist movie nor a LGBT topic. It is purely cross-class love, but it happens to be the same sex. The whole film is in a tight rhythm.

244,25 December 2016,reid-hawk,9, Graphically Beautiful,"Chan Woo Park's ""The Handmaiden"" is a fantastic film that borders on being a masterpiece. From a film making perspective alone, both its cinematography and editing are incredible (and I don't use that word lightly). As of this moment this is the best shot film of the year. The shots are gorgeous and the camera work is fantastic; the camera always seems to move to the perfect angle at the perfect time to maximize the quality of each and every scene. Lots of times the movie jumps out of chronological order rapidly between scenes. These scenes never feel hard to follow and they always transition into each other beautifully. By showing moments of the film out of order (as well as some scenes multiple times from different viewpoints), the movie allows the viewer to glean new information about the characters and the story. And yes, the story is also very good and filled with deep characters and twists at every turn. ""The Handmaiden"" is definitely not a good first rated-R movie to show your kids, however. In fact, maybe only ""The Wolf of Wallstreet"" rivals this movie when it comes to the sheer graphicness of nudity and sex scenes (besides NC-17 films of course and much of Lars Von Triers work). What I love about the sex scenes besides the fact that they're, you know, hot sex scenes, is that they aren't there just help somebody feel the blood flow down low. They actually serve a purpose; both to the story and to the development of the film's major characters (They do have some nasty and loud a** licking sounds going on in them that I can't say I'm a fan of however). The other graphic aspect of this movie is its violence. This movie isn't overly violent, and in fact there are only a handful (this is a pretty good pun if you've seen the movie) of scenes with any brutality in them whatsoever, but trust me when I say those scenes aren't for the faint of heart. The movie's blackly comical nature helps negate lots of the more disturbing aspects of these moments as well. Park has made his best movie to date in my opinion, and it goes without saying that I love ""The Handmaiden"".",

259,5 April 2021,yusufkaanatanur,7, A Sharp Picture,"A very sharp picture. Loved the way it conveyed and made us notice tension where it wasn't the ""in your face"" kind. Using smaller side plots, twists and emotions that act as release valves throughout the film rather than a final release of tension is something this film does. While this looks all too nice at first, it puts the pace of the story in an awkward position when there is no final kick to end it all. The visuals were good but at most scenes they weren't that special. Really liked how the director told us the story in a way that it moved on our reactions. While this is good for the first couple of twists and turns, it hinders the story when the audience gets tired on the long run. The whole film felt more like an American Classic, like the Great Gatsby, in its Storytelling rather than a Japanese drama at first but it slowly turned sour as the story commenced. The whole love and death theme was also well-done. The most highly noticeable thing that I don't like is probably the timing of the themes. In this matter, some are underdone and raw while others are overdone and burnt. This is caused by the far too many turns arcs in the story. Good watch overall.",

270,11 July 2018,Wheepuppy,10, Simply genius.,"The Handmaiden was born as an adaptation of Sarah Water's 2002 novel Fingersmith, a Victorian crime novel Park Chang-wook took the inspiration from, taking as a reference its investigation in repression and the limits of female empowerment. Despite of this, he was able to convert the story, the characters and the costumes and scenarios into the dynamics of the Japanese occupation of South Korea during the war. Thus, the film tackles themes as love, betrayal, conflicts on personal interests and liberation. With only four characters, the movie offers a magnificent story with several plots and twists, thanks to a successful choice of narrative style and form.
The Handmaiden is an amazing movie that evidences the perfected style of a recognized director who surpasses himself with every movie he releases, that shows majestic combinations of quality cinematography, editing, sound and the perfect use of scenarios, a very well written and complex characters, along with an even more well developed story throughout the plot, thanks to the correct decisions made on form and style of the film.

281,30 December 2016,kraytdragon-sean,9, An Excellent Lesbian Drama,"Park Chan-wook is one of the most versatile directors around. Sure, Park seems fixated on tales of vengeance but never does the worn theme feel like a detractor in his films. Oldboy and Snowpiercer add intricate layers which transform the initial quest for revenge into other issues entirely. The Handmaiden is a movie that keeps the best traits of the South Korean director. Sure revenge underlines the narrative and yet the film is not entirely about revenge. Likewise, the Handmaiden is an erotic thriller and isn't an erotic thriller. A lesser director would hone in on the pornographic but the film never undercuts one of the meta-messages found within the film. Without spoiling Handmaiden, a Clockwork Orange is a film with a similar meta-commentary directed at the audience. Instead, the erotic scenes give the intended effect without going full throttle. The result is a lesbian love story which accentuates emotion over physicality. Male directors have a tendency to get a little excited with lesbian love stories and turn an otherwise amazing movie into pornography. Blue is the Warmest Color is a recent example of a film which could have utilized a little restraint required of its subject matter. The central ""love triangle"" in the Handmaiden is given an air of realism due to the level of restraint. Most characters are never who they appear to be throughout the film. In fact, the three chapter structure of the film allows for the rare successful attempt at having more than one plot twist. Film veterans are likely the only group of people who can put the puzzle pieces together early on. The twists never come across as cheap gimmicks thanks to the cinematography. The gorgeous mise en scene is spellbinding with the amount of variation found in limited locations. In spite of the lavish designs, the camera never hides character ticks one can begin to hone in on. The Handmaiden contains a lot of the admirable traits one might in a Stanley Kubrick film (the Clockwork Orange reference is not entirely pulled out of a hat). However, the middle-aged Korean director is able to separate and maybe transcend Kubrick in his use of overt dark humor. Manchester by the Sea is another serious film which also successfully utilizes humor to create a humanistic story. Kubrick usually utilizes dark comedy for an entirely different effect. The Handmaiden is an absolutely must-see for those who appreciate cinematic greatness.",

296,23 July 2019,sfmiller-71496,9, A gorgeous and spellbinding movie,"Aesthetically mesmerizing and intricately written. The story is separated into three parts, showing different occurrences through other points of view with different contexts. The director wants the audience to second, even third guess themselves. One part might show a particular scene one way, and the next may show it through a different angle/tone, adding or excluding dialogue. It creates an atmosphere where the characters true intentions are not clear. This contributes to the film's unpredictability. The set for much the movie is an incredible estate, built with an extreme contrast in English and Japan architecture. A maze lending itself to voyeurism and eavesdropping. The sex scene (shown twice with different contexts) is as intense and provoking as it gets for the big screen. Much homage is payed to artistic vision in this movie: The shots of the many scrolls and paintings/drawings themselves, the closeups of spying eyes, the visual reenactment of the erotic novels, and scenes with the estates Japanese gardens as the backdrop.

It tackles a lot of important issues such as the male gaze but this movie, which is supposed to show a very raw emotion between 2 women, has it's own problem of the male gaze and you can feel it through out the film. It is specially visible during the sex scenes, even though the 2 actors had a lot of chemistry and their emotions were mostly shown without them having to say a word those scenes made no sense at all and it was painfully obvious that they were directed by a straight man who has no idea about a relationship like this (have in mind that I'm NOT talking about the writers but the director). I did not feel the femininity I should have which I don't think is an acting or writing problem but a directing one.
