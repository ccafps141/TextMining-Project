1,8 November 2005,aimless-46,9, Clean Sweep,"Consider this, ""It Happened One Night"" was made in 1933 which gives it the distinction 70+ years later of being the oldest film still widely viewed by mainstream audiences. And most of the runner-ups for oldest film are 1930's screwball comedies inspired by the success of this seminal film which made a clean sweep of the 1934 Academy Awards. The genre has held up over the years because these are small human stories with themes that are still relevant. ",r

Out of the blue, Ellie jumps overboard and swims to the shore. Andrews hires a detective agency to find her and offers a 10,000 dollars reward for any information about his daughter. But Ellie pawns her watch, buys some clothing and a bus ticket to New York to meet her lover. She seats side- by-side with the cynical reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable). However, when a thief steals her purse with her money in a bus stop and Ellie does not report to the police, Peter recognizes and blackmails Ellie, asking her to travel together with him. He promises to protect her and in return he would write her adventure to meet King Westley. Along their journey, Ellie falls in love for Peter; but when he vanishes from the motel where they are lodged and contacts her father later, she believes he was only interested in the reward. In the end, love triumphs and the wall of Jericho falls. ",i
5,22 August 2003,lugonian,9, The Runaway Heiress,"IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (Columbia, 1934), directed by Frank Capra, based on a short story ""Night Bus"" by Samuel Hopkins Adams, ranks one of the best known and popular romantic comedies from the 1930s, thanks to the star chemistry of Clark Gable (on loan from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) and Claudette Colbert (on loan from Paramount), with fine direction by Frank Capra, witty screenplay by Robert Risken, and for being the very first motion picture to win all five major Academy Awards, including Best Actor (Gable); Best Actress (Colbert); Best Director (Capra); Best Screenplay and Best Picture. This might have been an ""upset"" in 1934, considering other top-rated films and performances of the year, but who would have imagined IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT to still be as entertaining today as it was back in 1934?",e

But of course my professor stops the movie right when it was getting good. After that, I wanted to see this movie so badly. My father lucky enough had the movie. I watched it and it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Clark Gable is histerical. He really does a great job in the film. I always did prefer the old comedies to today. Do you blame me?

7,23 June 2002,comix-man,9, Introducing... the Screwball Comedy,"Frank Capra's idealistic outlook on life is evident in his films. From It Happened One Night to It's a Wonderful Life, Capra has always had a tendency to let the little guy rise above it all and beat the odds. It is no small wonder that Capra enjoyed much of his success during the Depression, when movies were used to truly pull an audience out of the despair of the 1930s into a world where anything can happen, where being a nice person is all you need to succeed. While the fact that the country was in the middle of the Depression was not completely ignored, an overly optimistic view on life was taken to counter the despair of everyday life.",/

9,6 October 2007,ackstasis,8," ""I want to see what love looks like when it's triumphant. I haven't had a good laugh in a week.""","Released in 1934, Frank Capra's 'It Happened One Night' ushered in a new era of Hollywood film-making  the screwball comedy  and made Academy Award history in the process. It became the first film to be awarded the top five awards on the night (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), a feat that remained unequaled until 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)' and 'The Silence of the Lambs (1991).' As I watch more of his films, Frank Capra is fast becoming one of my most respected directors, with such classics as 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' and 'It's a Wonderful Life' ranking among my favourites of all time. This screwball comedy, however, posed a certain problem, since I've never been a huge fan of the sub-genre. Whilst I had enjoyed such films as 'My Man Godfrey' and 'His Girl Friday,' they hadn't really offered anything other than comedy. This means that they did a good job of making us laugh, but never really inspired any other emotions  which isn't necessarily a handicap, but doesn't appeal to my tastes.",w

11,12 February 2021,tcchelsey,10, THE MOVIE THAT TURNED HOLLYWOOD UPSIDE DOWN! NO KIDDING!,"Hollywood after all is a town of gosh-darn dumb luck, indeed! I worked there for many years and heard a heck of a lot of stories. This is one of them. Two up and coming actors, and an industrious director willing to roll the dice on a not too shabby Depression era story, all somehow came together, and all turned into the parking lot of a low budget studio called Columbia Pictures. They put their heads together, put the egos in the back pocket, thank you, applied a little elbow grease and with a little luck produced one of the most beloved romantic comedies of all time! How's that for a Hollywood happy ending? IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT put Gable on the map, whose career was slow to start, if not going in the direction he had hoped, and gave a very small studio an undisputed reputation as a can-do organization now open for business! HOORAY! Don't you just love it? The rest is history, of course, but not without saying what an unforgettable story this is and, perhaps, the very first road trip movie ever conceived. It is also, remarkably, a very simple story of young man meets young woman and the adventures that they share together, going at it as best as they can, and let us not forget during the height of the Great Depression. Truly, audiences at the time needed a good laugh and this gem of a film was their answer, which it remains to this day. Also a tip of the hat to a marvelous supporting cast, foremost Walter Connolly as Colbert's frustrated father whose bark is worse than his bite and has one heck of a time in between! Director Frank Capra outdid himself in this one, but when you have a dream and you believe in what you're doing, it just may surprise you in the end. Not to be forgotten, make that cannot be forgotten, because there is a little bit of all of us in this film if you dig deep enough. Surprise!",2

15,13 May 2001,gmmax,10," This classic never loses its magic! Romance, warmth & humor!","This sweet comedy never loses its appeal.  Claudette Colbert is a spoiled young girl who meets a wordly, attractive newspaper reporter (Clark Gable). In the beginning, she treats him like a servant, but he never knuckles under to this behavior.  The interaction between these two is very romantic and humorous.  It is the classic portrayal of what may be called ""sexual tension.""  He takes care of her - does not take advantage of her - but makes her realize that her wealthy background cannot carry her through as a human being, she has to earn his respect by treating him with respect.  There is a scene in which the two of them are forced to hitchhike, and their ""breakfast"" is only a handful of carrots plucked from a garden they were lucky to find.  As Gable stands at the edge of the road and Colbert is perched atop a wooden fence, his wisecracking posture is said to be the inspiration for the beloved cartoon character Bugs Bunny.  This is a must-see for every one who loves old movies, and entertaining for all.",5

That's probably so because the dialog between the two stars of the picture - Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert - is just great. Those two make this fun to watch. I enjoyed it, however, much more on the first viewing than subsequent ones. It lost some of its zip after I knew what to expect. The ending, too, was very weak.

18,14 November 2011,planktonrules,10, Watch the original....,"Often, I don't bother reviewing films with a bazillion reviews already or films that are classics. After all, what could one more review contribute? However, I have a reason to finally review ""It Happened One Night"". Tonight, I watched a god-awful mess called ""You Can't Run Away From Love"". Why? Well, because it starred Jack Lemmon and I almost always like his films. Sadly, after a few minutes, I realized it was a musical remake of ""It Happened One Night"". And, sadly, it VERY closely followed the original--and that's the problem. Seeing Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert in the original is charming and both fine actors were at the top of their game. Jack Lemmon and June Allyson (especially Allyson) were pretty bad--and it's so apparent when they are parroting Gable and Colbert. It made me appreciate the original so much more! So, if you are bored and have nothing to do, do NOT watch the remake!! Watch ""It Happened One Night""--even if you've already seen it before! The film is charming, funny and sweet.",?

Willful Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), the daughter of millionaire Alexander Andrews (Walter Conolly), has fled her powerful father's yacht, in order to reach the man she claims she loves, an aviator named King Wesley (Jameson Thomas).

21,5 May 2008,Quinoa1984,10, one of the great light-hearted romance comedies,"Frank Capra's It Happened One Night was a film I saw a few years ago, first and only time (though there will be other viewings to come), and it's never left me. Not exactly on a big profound dramatic level like a lot of other films of the 30s- including Capra's It's a Wonderful Life- but it's got such an air of confidence to its light-hearted comedy, and the winning combo of Gable and Colbert. The story is pretty simple, which is good so as to allow for this odd couple to bond and grow in behavioral terms; Colbert is spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews and she's just tied the knot, and Gable plays reporter Peter Warne. She jumps ship and Peter follows. It becomes a road movie soon after that (including the famous ""leg"" bit that's been a staple of male fantasy even up to today to a certain degree), and Capra gets his fun in showing these two characters as being so right for each other for all the wrong reasons. In that sense it's the prototypical romantic comedy, one that we've seen perhaps far too much today and parrotted without a lick of the whimsy Capra gives it. But it's also a big credit to the stars that they keep this tale uplifting (it was the depression after all), and they're simply magnetic personalities to fill up such identifiable personas. It's terrific.",f

The cast is excellent and the two leads have dynamic chemistry. First film to sweep the five major Oscar categories (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay).

23,6 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10, A wonderful film that is as charming as it is funny,"From the director of the timeless classic that is It's a Wonderful Life, comes It Happened One Night, a wonderful film that is as charming as it is funny. While some parts are quite idealistic, it is essentially a screwball romantic comedy and a great one at that. The direction from Frank Capra is classy and dignified and cleverly gives us an insight into gender and class status, and the screenplay is sophisticated and funny. The humour still works, I found myself laughing when Clark Gable said ""now don't tell you're in love with the bus driver"" for example. The cinematography is beautiful and dynamic and the music is richly and sensitively scored. The acting is very, very good. Clark Gable looks handsome here, and he gives a close to hysterical performance as Peter, with his impeccable comic timing and witty humour. Claudette Colbert is lovely as Ellie, the spoiled yet somewhat independent heiress who Peter falls for. The two actors show great, charming chemistry together on screen, and they are terrifically supported by especially Walter Connolly as Andrews. The story is relatively simple, but I liked its simplicity, it was effective. Overall, a wonderful, funny and charming film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",=
24,19 November 2018,christopher-underwood,9," Chirpy and cheeky, happy and snappy","Chirpy and cheeky, happy and snappy with great performances from Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert. She was already a star, he was about to become one whilst Frank Capra, under pressure to get this finished quickly so Colbert to move on to another gig, roars into the spotlight with this Oscar winning film. Also, arguably the beginnings of the screwball comedies, the film is a joy from start to finish, plus with Blu-ray you get to enjoy all those cars and buses and hot dog stands. Whilst the film plays with the idea of coyness, it is more or less pre-code and gets away with many a wisecrack that would have been cut the following year. Good script, lines beautifully delivered and the speed and screen wipes ensure (until the rather unnecessary hold up towards the end with all the wedding build up) that this moves like a bullet and facilitating multiple viewings.

27,3 January 2014,ironhorse_iv,8, Break down the walls of Jericho! This movie is pretty funny!,"It's a pretty good romance-comedy. I think some of these modern romance comedies, need to have their producers look back at this film as research, on how to make a good film. Still, why the title? Nothing happened one night? The movie takes place over several weeks, it appears. They first met one night, sure, but it didn't take a night settling to have them, fall in love. I like the title to be, Night Bus like the book by Samuel Hopkins Adams, in which the movie is based on. At less, that makes kinda more sense. Directed by Frank Capra, the movie is told through a screwball comedy that has the two leads engage in a funny battle of the sexes where the woman is often dominating and the male character is often challenge in the masculinity sense. You have to love the fast-pace repartee, farcical situations, and escapist themes here. It's hard, not to get into this film. The format came to be, whenever a major film is trying to avoid censorship from the harsh Hayes Code of the time. Verbal sparring between the sexes often serve as a stand in for physical, sexual tension. Indeed, this movie is a sex comedy without any sex. The screwball comedy also serve as a mention in discuss the issues of social classes between the different of the poor to those of the rich. The movie starts with spoil brat pampered Miami socialite, Ellen ""Ellie"" Andre (Claudette Colbert) is trying to get out from under her father's (Walter Connolly) thumb by trying to marries fortune-hunter ""King"" Westley (Jameson Thomas) against the wishes of her father who wants to have the marriage annulled. She wants to run away to go meet up Westley in New York, only to find herself sharing a bus ride with roguish out of work reporter, Peter Warne (Clark Gable) whom is wanting to use her story to get him the biggest new scoop in his life. There are numerous famous scenes throughout the film, that is later recycle, remade or spoof after such as the runaway bride or the famous hitchhiking leg scene. One of the biggest impact, the film had on popular culture was the influence it gave to a certain animator. The scenes with a minor character, Oscar Shapely (Roscoe Karns), continually calling the Gable character ""Doc"", plus the imaginary character named ""Bugs Dooley"" mentioned once to frighten Shapely, and a scene in which Gable eats carrots while talking quickly with his mouth full, gave the animator, the idea of Bugs Bunny. Other mentions of ""Looney Tunes"" characters from the film include Alexander Andrews and King Westley being the inspirations for Yosemite Sam and Pepé LePew, respectively. I do have to say, my favorite scene in the movie is the 'flying trapeze' singing bus scene. While, it's mostly unlikely this would had happen in real life, I have to say the song gives the movie, its charm.I do have to say, while the movie seems lighted hearted; there is several dark humor that is still kinda risking even in today's standards. There is a scene where Warne and Andre act like a hillbilly domestic abuse couple that is a bit disturbing. Then there is a scene where Warne steals a car, after the driver tries to drive off with their luggage. That's still Grant Theft Auto, Peter. You can go to jail for that. It doesn't help his case if he even did go to trial, as he also pretended that he was indeed a gang leader in another scene in the movie, admitting to 'kidnapping' Andre. Still, with his good-natured, street-smart, and breezy performance, Gable would likely be not guilty of the crime, but found guilty on his sex appeal. He did influenced the un-sale of undershirts by taking off his shirt and exposing his bare chest in the film. The acting was pretty good here. I didn't think, Colbert deserve her Best Actress role, as her character wasn't so far off from her real life. Plus, she only took the role because her salary was doubled and she can get a well-planned vacation. Gable was more reluctant participant in the film. It's hard to believe that these two actors are supposed to fall in love with each other, as there was a tense atmosphere as Gable and Colbert did reading. However, they established a friendly working relationship and found that the script was no worse than those of many of their earlier films. Colbert continue to bark trouble during her time on the set, complaining. There are some critics out there that blame the movie for being a bit sexist. Both, Ellen and Peter can seem like unlikeable character because Ellen is a brat and Peter is pompous. His treatment of her reflects his disdain for her class, not because she was a woman. Her behavior reflects her inexperience with the real world, her disdain for his arrogance, and her fear of being out on the road alone. It's very easy to look back and criticize, the social norms of another era but our standards and culture have changed gradually over time; how can we look back and impose those standards on another. I really don't see the movie as sexist at all. The movie did help the bus system more as travel by women substantially increased as a result of the film. Overall: If a fan of classic movies, this movie is one movie, you need to watch. Show a leg, and get hitched.",u

It was an adapted screenplay (by Robert Riskin), from the short story ""Night Bus"" and was directed by Frank Capra. With a simple story, plot, modest budget and a very short four week production schedule, this film goes a long way. Director Frank Capra obviously knew the story to tell and how to tell it. Some of the best films are made in a surprisingly short amount of time and on a modest budget. This film followed what Capra hoped would be a critical and box office success.

31,10 November 2007,dataconflossmoor,10, Hello Miss!! Have You Met My Testosterone Driven Desires?,"This movie was truly revolutionary when it hit the silver screen! ""It Happened One Night"" swept all four major academy awards back in 1934!! Best Actress (Claudette Colbert) Best Actor (Clark Gable) Best Director (Frank Capra) and, of course, BEST PICTURE!! Why was this movie considered so promiscuous and avant garde? Basically because of all the covert innuendos, and the lewd insinuations which gave every indication that, even back then, sex was not just for pro-creation purposes!! When dealing with the demons inside of your typical red blooded American male..What exactly was it that they had to do to assuage their consciences anyway? Now presides the proverbial instance of a ""gentleman"" having his cake and eating it too. This is not really possible!! Not for a ""gentleman"" anyway! The classic scene in this movie was predicated on Claudette Cobert's actions being of her own volition.. The necessary bed sheet in the most classic scene in ""It Happened One Night"" was construed as a case whereby Clark Gable knew the repercussions of such an ensuing fate without the presence of this symbolic divisiveness!! This film definitely delves into the euphemisms which imply that something had to be done to quell such a precariously enticing and comfortably volatile situation!! Without overt barricades, it would be something other than spiritual growth that Clark Gable would have to worry about!! This film broke ground on the wilder side of male's hormonal nature!! The reciprocating movie audience had a thorough comprehension of what the potential chicanery was which loomed on the horizon! Clark Gable's wiles were emerging and ready to surface!! AFI has listed this as one of the top 100 films ever made in the history of the American cinema. This does not surprise me, the issue of carnal desires always evoked a sordid curiosity with the average movie viewer!! The innocence of maverick movie making entertained the movie audience with this film's innocuous approach!! Being candid about the whole situation, it stands to reason that chivalry has to contend with the formidable foes that are related to the innate and lecherous desires of lonely men!! Frank Capra directs this film, and it goes without saying that Capra is a remarkable director... His list of outstanding movies is endless! ""It's A Wonderful Life"" gets the star lighted accolade of being his stellar mantel piece trophy!! The acting in the film ""It Happened One Night"" was fantastic, and the entertaining double entendre to everything made this film very enjoyable!! By today's standards, of course, this film would not be considered sexually suggestive in any substantial manner whatsoever. However, given the fact that this film was made in 1934, ""It Happened One Night"" became the harbinger of things to come with the advent of depicting how sexual indiscretion can proliferate once Pandora's's box is opened!! Wonderful movie!! The talent in this film is utterly astounding!!",

When I think of 'screwball', I'm looking for snappy one liners and engaging chemistry between the principals, but the film didn't deliver for me on that score. Gable's character came off as rather harsh for my taste, especially in the scene at the cabin when they faked their marriage to convince the authorities that Ellie (Claudette Colbert) wasn't the person they were looking for. There was also that set up at the beginning of the relationship when Peter Warne (Gable) has the 'so there' tiff with the bus driver.

It ought to be as bad as the worst movies Frank Capra ever made, but somehow Capra overcomes everything, even himself, to craft a gem.  It's completely absurd, of course, in the way a Dickens novel is absurd, but it works because we wish it could work in reality.  And it works because Clark Gable was a mediocre leading man in drama but a fine comedian; because it has the peculiar 1930's way of making men and women oddly both different and equal; because nobody took the whole thing seriously, but just played it out.  An absolute don't miss, especially if you're thinking of getting married.",

It's quite clear that the leads, Gable and Colbert, didn't care for being in it, and neither character is very sympathetic at all. It seems very paint by numbers, and just ambles along. I have to agree with Claudette Colbert, who couldn't understand why it was and remained so popular. I found it quite overrated and can't hold a candle to many other comedies to come out of the 30's.

There are very less movies coming near to the brilliance of ""It Happened One Night"". This movie is about a rich brat running from her home to get married with her lover, accompanied with struggling free lancer reporter in her journey. And in the journey they fall for each other. The romance building between two of them is nicely depicted and the blend of Peter Warne (Gables) arrogant personality gives it a nice stir. The story of the movie is very interesting and the comic attribute added by both Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert is sufficed to make anyone laugh.

The unhappy daughter of a wealthy banker flees daddy's yacht in Miami, intent on getting to New York City to be reunited with the man she married against her father's wishes; a recently-fired newspaper reporter attempts to befriend the spoiled heiress on their journey by bus. Wafer-thin material stretched to the breaking point, with a rollicking first-half (in buses and roadside motels) let down by less-funny second and third acts more concerned with a quasi-introspective study of character. Robert Riskin won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar; Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert also won for their performances. Indeed, their rapport is easy and free of gimmicks, though some of the sniping grates. Frank Capra won two Academy Awards, one for his direction and the other for producing this Best Picture winner. Its American minutiae was fresh and novel at the time--and some of it still holds up today--but when the wisecracks turn somber, and Riskin's script loops around to bide time, the film seems less a feel-good trifle than an over-praised, desperate movie-star ""product"".

The dynamics between the chief characters are ripe for comedy, and the situational humor in the picture is fantastic. Clark Gable and especially Claudette Colbert give wonderfully spirited performances that are a real pleasure to watch, not least as they have outstanding on-screen chemistry; I could easily stand to watch ten more films starring these two. The scene writing and narrative at large sharp and smart, a true delight, and who but Frank Capra could be relied upon to make a movie with so much lighthearted warmth? Some moments that would come off as ham-handed in another title are executed with a joyous earnestness that's welcome and refreshing; in contrast, some scenes and dialogue are so silly that the term ""screwball comedy"" feels insufficient, elevating mundanity to an art form of ridiculousness. All this would be more than enough in and of itself, but the production design and art direction are rich and inviting, and the costume design and hair and makeup no less so. Joseph Walker's cinematography, meanwhile, is at once both soft and vivid, allowing 'It happened one night' to literally be easy on the eyes. It's no wonder why this is held in such high regard, for even ninety years on, it's superbly entertaining!",
46,12 December 2014,larry41onEbay,10, Here are my notes from when I last introduced it on the big screen...1/2,"The idea for tonight's film started in a barber shop while Frank Capra was waiting for a haircut he read an old magazine article in Cosmopolitan called ""Night Bus"" by Samuel Hopkins Adams. It was a cute idea so Capra asked Columbia studios to buy the rights to it and then he forgot about it. Frank's previous feature was LADY FOR A DAY which got great reviews and was Columbia studio's first film ever Oscar nominated and Capra's. Irving Thalberg wanted Capra to make his next film at MGM in exchange for $50k and the loan of a star. But at the last minute Louis B. Mayer canceled the film but honored the deal. Back at Columbia Capra wanted to make Night Bus, but studio tyrant Harry Cohn and all his advisers fought against it. They said things like, ""It's nothing; froth, trivia, just another bus picture, no suspense, no heart, no oomph, winter's coming and it's all exteriors."" All they could get Capra to do was change the title to IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT which they said was too long to fit on a marquee! Capra tried casting Myrna Loy – she turned it down; then Margaret Sullavan – said 'no thank you'; Miriam Hopkins was insulted and said, 'Not if I never play another part'; Constance Bennett told him to go fly a kite and then offered to buy the script and have it rewritten for her! Capra had co-written the script with his favorite writer Robert Riskin but they brought in Myles Connolly who added more sympathetic and interesting characters so people could identify with them. The pretty girl, a spoiled brat, was rich yes but bored with being an heiress now wanting something real. The man was made a guy we all know and like; a tough crusading reporter on the outs with his pigheaded editor. It's The Taming Of The Shrew, but the shrew must be worth taming and the guy must be one of us. Back to casting, this time they went after Robert Montgomery a great light comedian at MGM. Mayer called Cohn and said, ""Montgomery says there are too many bus pictures and (don't take this in the wrong way) but going from MGM to lowly Columbia was an insult. But you've caught me in a good mood. I got an actor here who's been a bad boy. Wants more money. And I'd like to spank him. You can have Clark Gable."" Surprisingly the next knock on Capra's shabby office door came from a very drunk and cursing Gable, reporting to Siberia as he called it. Gable's objections almost made Capra throw in the towel but then Harry Cohn suggested getting Claudette Colbert for the girl in the story. (He had heard she liked money.) So Capra and Riskin made an appointment that very night to see her at her home. When they arrived Colbert regretted agreeing to the meeting as she was packing to leave on a month long skiing vacation. Capra saw this attractive, wealthy and spoiled woman and knew she was perfect for the part. So Capra, after being bit in the butt by her dog, asked what it would take to get her in the picture. (Capra had directed her first picture, FOR THE LOVE OF MIKE a silent made in 1927 and a flop) To throw him off she said she normally made $25k a picture (a price Columbia had never paid to an actor before), he would have to double it AND she was only available from her studio Paramount during her Christmas vacation. They would have to shoot all her scenes and retakes in less than 4 weeks -- half the time they had budgeted! So Capra called Cohn to ask would he pay her the $50k, Cohn said ""I can pay it if you can shoot it in 4 weeks."" Capra said, he didn't know, but he'd try. So they told her, ""Deal, Claudette! $50k for 4 weeks! Okay?"" To which she replied, ""Oh for God's sake!"" She was trapped. That next day she had to report for her costume fittings and the day after that they begin filming in a hurry. While they shot film all day Capra edited and rewrote the story to tighten it up at night. To make the film and story move quicker he asked the actors to talk faster, his amazing cinematographer Joseph Walker to shoot faster. They had little time to build sets so most of the film had to be shot on location. If an actor didn't show up one day he was replaced by another and lines were rewritten. Most scenes were shot in one short take and then they sprinted on to the next location. Capra, getting exhausted claimed he felt like a boxer who left his fight in the gym. But, things started to pull together as they filmed. Capra in his autobiography talked about the happy accidents like when Colbert did not want to undress in front of the camera came up with the blanket being used as the ""walls of Jericho."" Gable to save time undressing skipped wearing a t-shirt, causing t-shirt sales to later plummet. One of the best happy accidents happened when Capra decided to add a scene on the bus of a couple hillbilly musicians who start singing The Man On The Flying Trapeze to break up the monotony. He noticed the extras started smiling and singing along, almost becoming child like. Frank stopped and called for 4 more cameras and his stars. He told everyone they had no time to rehearse but to feel free to join in the singing and ham it up if they wanted too. He then told Gable and Colbert that they were a pair of icebergs when the scene stars and they were to slowly melt. Then they shot it all in one take. Just watch the actor's faces as they naturally shed their inhibitions and join in having fun!",

'It happened one Night' was the first movie of it's kind way back in the 30's where romantic comedies were yet to be born. This is considered as the first major romantic comedy in Hollywood history. Add to it, it was the first ever 'Screwball comedy' movie. Yup, this was actually a new genre invented by Capra. After reading some trivia about the movie, I came to know that the leads Gable and Colbert hated the script so much that they wanted to get over with the movie as soon as possible. Actually, the story of this movie is so simple that it can be explained in a paragraph. But the story-teller that Capra is, this simple story is converted into a very lovable and feel good rom-com which never ceases to amaze you. The movie is full of clichés such as a rich spoilt girl falling in love with a not so wealthy guy and the girl running away from her marriage once she realizes her true love etc etc. But one must also consider the time when this movie was made. Perhaps, this was the first bride runway from marriage scene of cinema history. This movie also influenced a lot of other artists and filmmakers. The cartoon Bugs Bunny is influenced by one of the characters from this movie. Bollywood influence being 'Dil Hai Ki Maanta Nahi'.",

57,23 September 2013,Bob Pr.,6," Interesting ""Time Travel"" to an era","Background to that '30s era: this 1934 film is often called the first (of the many following) in the 'screwball comedy' genre; it came out in the worst of the Great Depression (US unemployment in 1928 was 2.9%, by 1933 it hit 25%; millions were hungry and desperate, leading to some antagonisms between economic classes). This was also a time when women's roles were changing in the US: the 'women's suffrage' movement gained women the right to vote in 1920 (19th Amendment), more equality in decision-making, more freedom in dress, gender & sexual roles (e.g., '20s 'Flappers'). ""Screwball comedies"" capitalized and fed on those changes: they typically ""feature farcical situations, a combination of slap-stick with fast-paced repartee and show struggles between"" (central characters of different) ""economic classes. They also generally feature a self-confident and often stubborn central female protagonist and a plot involving courtship and marriage or remarriage"" (""quotes"" from Wikipedia).",
58,26 September 2001,cutter-12,7, Early Capra with rough edges,"I'm a big fan of Frank Capra films.  Meet John Doe, It's a Wonderful life, and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and Mr. Deeds Goes to Town are four of the greatest films ever made.  Capra was not without his misses and downright lemons though.  Arsenic and Old Lace and the abysmal Here Comes the Groom fall into these categories.  It Happened one Night falls somewhere in between.  Not an all out screwball comedy and not alot of social commentary, it is nevertheless a good light road picture, one of the first, and shouldn't fail to entertain.  Innovative in it's way it was the forerunner to many more comedies in the later 30's which have become standards in the genre of Screwball. Capra here was still honing his technique for better films to come and it shows. At times the timing is off and the writing could use snappier one liners which hit the mark. Gable's funnier moments seem to be accidental or improvised -- and Colbert, though capable, just is no Carole Lombard or Rosalind Russell in her delivery.  The thigh scene where she hails the passing car has been improved upon in several later comedies and even cartoons.  Even though I like this picture, I feel it is another film which has received a higher rating over the years than it is due.  Maybe it's just my love of more complex and polished comedic situations and dialogue in films like Bringing up Baby and His Girl Friday etc which I'm missing here. Cary Grant was, afterall, the definitive leading man in this type of picture.  It Happened one Night is a good, not great evening at the movies.  If you want to see Clark Gable really turning on the comedy charm check out Teacher's Pet with Doris Day which was made late in his career.  I've yet to see a better Gable comedy than that.  And if you're looking for another sweet road picture from yesteryear I recommend A Lady Takes a Chance with Jean Arthur and John Wayne, a light screwball comedy dappled with excellent performances.  It's a shame it is long forgotten and hard to obtain on video.",

78,29 September 2009,s-diblasicrain,8, HIST American Film,"""It Happened One Night"" is a charming and fresh comedy with a series of mix-ups, inconvenient circumstance and an eventually happy ending. This movie is a perfect example of what many romantic comedies were like during it's time, mostly due to the many rules and regulations of the Motion Picture Production Code, which came into effect in 1930. For example Peter (played by Clark Gable) and Ellie (a married woman and played by Claudette Colbert), go through much together throughout the movie and during these series of events they fall in love. On two separate occasions they end up having to stay the night in one hotel room together. Both times the rooms have two separate single beds on opposite sides of the room and between them a blanket gets hung in order to make this situation seem more appropriate, and to ensure that nothing would happen between this man and woman. Even though Paul and Ellie develop strong feelings for each other, to the point where Ellie (in desperation not to go back to her husband) practically throws herself at Paul, but is told that she had better get back to her side of the blanket. It is not until the very end, after the marriage gets properly annulled and Paul and Ellie get married, that the movie can make the suggestion that something more than flirting may happen between the two.

Unlike Gone with the Wind's Scarlett O'Hara, his companion in this film is a ditz who never rises from her cluelessness and dependence. This interaction is what makes the film unique but also a bit strange, as the supposed charm of Peter Warnes comes across as exploitative and domineering and it is hard to sympathise with him or the happy ending.

Peter and Ellie go through several adventures together, her initial disdain for him fades away, she finds herself falling in love with him, there is a point when she uses her sex appeal to get a hitchhike, but the person who picks them up attempts to steal their luggage, but Peter stop him, and steals his car.

Actually, according to IMDb.COM, Gable ditched his undershirt because it interfered with the flow of the scene when he was shedding his apparel. Second, Colbert flaunted her leg when Gable cannot thumb them a ride. Indeed, history takes some interesting turns. Reportedly, Colbert lambasted the movie before it became a big hit.

It stars Claudette Colbert as heiress Ellen Andrews who is eloping with a man whom her wealthy father objects too. He demands an annulment but she runs away boarding a bus to New York. On the bus she encounters a drunken struggling newspaper journalist Peter Warne, played by Clark Gable. He promises to help her get to New York if she grant him her publicized annulment details while on the road. Reluctantly, she agree and as predicted they go from bickering couple to actually falling in love. What works is a climax that bares charm and integrity. This becomes one of Frank Capra's biggest directional efforts and it works largely thanks to the chemistry between the leads. Gable brings much humour due to quirky dialogue and a knack for winning the argument, but he plays Warne with heart. Colbert plays the spoiled heiress set in her rebellious ways until a man like Warne says, ""no."" Walter Connolly plays her strict father who comes around for the right suitor. Roscoe Karns steals moments harassing Colbert on the bus. Alan Hale has a comical appearance as someone who picks them up hitchhiking and then attempts to steal their belongings but is stopped by Gable. Theme switches actions, attitudes, and mental destinations. Score: 9 / 10",

His intro scene is absolutely hilarious and reveals much of what to expect from him.

124,30 November 2005,robmeister,9, The First Great Romantic Comedy,"I have seen a few Frank Capra movies in my day, and I must say that this is my favorite of his films. Every modern romantic comedy, from ""The Graduate"" to ""When Harry Met Sally"" to ""Sleepless in Seattle"", owes a serious debt to the film that all but spawned the genre, ""It Happened One Night"".",
125,24 March 2021,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," Actually, it took about four.","'It Happened One Night (1934)' is the blueprint for almost every romantic comedy that came after it, actually being somewhat surprising in terms of how closely it conforms to the tropes that still adorn its genre to this very day. Of course, the reality is that the piece is creating a genre, not conforming to one. This inherently reduces the picture's potential 'seen it before' factor; we may have, but audiences at the time certainly hadn't. It sort of highlights just how formulaic even the very best rom-coms tend to be, primarily because they all feature at least one element that this flick first established. Seriously, it's all here: the will they/ won't they dynamic, the contrasting personalities, the bickering, the banter, the humour, the heart, the misunderstandings, the domineering parent, the other man, the 'all is lost' mix-up, the wedding-based finale... the list goes on. That's not to say it feels especially derivative, though - I mean, how could it? It holds up remarkably well considering its age, primarily because its lead actors - despite both apparently having no love for the movie - share a palpable chemistry and do the quick-witted dialogue justice. It's constantly moving towards its compellingly frustrating finale, barely wasting a second. In many ways, it's remarkably ahead of its time. In some others, of course, it isn't. For instance, Gable's leading man starts out as a bit of a creep and then becomes a straight-up jerk for the majority of the movie (he even threatens to break Colbert's character's neck at one point). Still, it's obviously a product of its time. In the end, it's an enjoyable and hugely influential romantic comedy. 7/10",

period of time.
The film starts off a bit slowly but keeps moving and picks up steam as it goes.
Some have complained about sexism in the film and
I suppose that is for the viewer to decide about. Is it sexism,all the trouble her dad and his men go through to locate the wayward daughter and keep her safe ?
I saw it as a decent man helping out a decent, impulsive woman that was in a jam. He was trading her a safe-passage to her husband,for the rights to publish the story of the adventure.
They both needed something from each other and tried to work it out in a respectful manner.

127,14 December 2003,Zoopansick,5, Not very funny,"The ONLY good thing about this movie is Clark Gable whose shirtless scenes actually led to a decrease in undershirt sales in the United States upon this movies release (that's true, and the funniest thing about this movie). Now I'm not someone who is opposed to old movies or even old comedies (though I think that pretty much all of them are products of their times, as are movies today).  But I don't find this movie funny at all.  It doesn't have witty lines and verbal humor nor does it have much slapstick or goofy stuff.  It doesn't really have any funny material, unless you find some annoying sailors on a bus singing the ""daring young man on the trapeze"" to be hilarious.  BTW the one sailors solo and dance proves that gays have been in the military for at least 70 years.  Even the Romantic portion of this movie is weak, mainly considering that Claudette's character is very unappealing.  She is really winey and not funny at all.  If you are looking for a classic comedy check out The Marx Brothers, The Thin Man series (which I think are still hilarious today, Asta alone is better then this entire movie), W.C. Fields, or even Buster Keaton (if you want to go that far back...he is better then Chaplin).  I guess I'd recommend this movie to Gable fans or people who want to see what won best picture in 1934 (im sure there was something better).  This is just one of those movies that has since attained untouchable classic status and is on the critics funniest movie lists.

I know it was the first screwball comedy, something in itself, but it's Capra's moving camera, the snappy dialogue and the credible acting even in unlikely situations that make you feel less like you're watching something staged. In all those senses, it plays like the first modern movie. Crazy as they sometimes are, Gable and Colbert's characters feel like real people, talking and acting naturally as they go. It's also a film made for adults to enjoy, the for-the-times risqué humour concerning the erection (no pun intended) of the symbolic Walls of Jericho between the thrown together couple, Gable's undressing to his bare torso, Colbert's hitching a ride for them by provocatively hitching her skirt and the closing consummation scene where the walls come tumbling down are all knowingly and winningly rendered.",

It's important to remember that this was made in the height of the Great Depression, and note the strict moral code of the time, fully incorporated into the movie.

Also angling for that last seat on the bus is the roguish ""Warne"" (Clark Gable) - a journalist with a nose for a good story. Determined to track her down, her father uses his media empire and soon her photo is all over the press. This doesn't go unnoticed by the shrewd ""Warne"", who soon reckons her story is worth a load of cash to his editor. What neither reckon on though, is that their initial hostility/indifference to each other gradually morphs into something - well, yes, you can guess that bit. Indeed, the story itself has a degree of predictability to it - but that doesn't matter here. This is a quickly paced, well written comedy drama that utilises the intimacy of the bus (or the motels) to provide an excellent vehicle for two actors who just exude a joyous chemistry - never a romantic, or sentimental one - as they try to stay one step ahead of the blokes sent by her father to return her to safety and to her affianced ""King Wesley"" (Jameson Thomas) who is the latest cause of the familial discord (her father loathes this opportunist fellow). Tables are turned and turned again as each try to outmanoeuvre the other - with Walter Connolly turning in quite an engaging performance as the dad who also knows there is more than one way to skin a cat.

As a comedy, Frank Capra's almost 90 year old light-weight romance has not aged all that well but as a pleasant snapshot of America in the '30s, it's great. Famously, the film cleaned up at the Oscars and the direction, cast, and script are all very good. Gable, one of Hollywood's iconic leading men, is willing to play the fool at times, (gnawing on carrots, ineffectually spitting, etc) something I always like in a 'star' and Colbert is great as the somewhat naïve, almost waifish 'spoiled rich girl'. The plot follows the usual 'meet cute - bonding adventures - love acknowledged - final-obstacle surmounted' trajectory but is enjoyable (and likely seemed a lot more original in the early 30s than now, after decades of similar storylines). The film was made before strict enforcement of the Hays Code, so the humour is slightly sly and risqué (although no more than many of the subsequent 'screwball comedies', which snuck a lot past Mrs. Grundy's censorious eyes).

Likewise Gable, in the opening scenes, suffers in somewhat tragic circumstances, and his character struggles to hide his dejection and sense of failure under a dapper appearance and good grooming. Without this foundation, the situation is silly and contrived, because these two attractive, intelligent, witty persons would have no reason to react as they do, suffering rebukes and slights from one another, mostly ""deserved"", or at least rationally handed out, according to their limited knowledge of each other.

It was a smallish romantic comedy produced on a modest budget from a minor studio. It would be a film, despite starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, that would vanish as time progressed, right? Guess again! The movie happened to be the table-setter for a new kind of film, and it is a movie that resonates well with people, even to today's modern audience. Personally, I found much to enjoy. Despite my misgivings on the screwball genre, Capra gets it right. The situations are zany, fast, and witty. The performances are excellent, and Capra is on the top of his game following his usually formula in the world of comedy.",
170,12 September 2008,Cosmoeticadotcom,8, Classic,"It is a very rare thing when a light-hearted comedy, something that is quintessentially the stuff of a 'good movie,' breaches into that territory where the term 'good film' can also be applied, but Frank Capra's 1934 film It Happened One Night may be an exception. Today, most people know Capra solely for his rediscovered classic It's A Wonderful Life, made a dozen years later, but this film was his first stab at what most critics would label greatness. This is all the more interesting because the 1930s, with their still newly developed sound technology, were still a transition period, of sorts, with the over the top hammy expressionistic acting of the silent films still dominating more than the more subtle naturalism of later film eras.",
171,22 May 2013,Hotwok2013,10, An antidote for depression,"It isn't any wonder why ""It Happened One Night"" struck such a chord with movie-goers in the depression-hit USA of the 1930's. Frank Capra's sparkling romantic comedy is just about as uplifting as any movie can possibly be. Whatever it is that makes a star a star, Clark Gable had it in spades more than any other leading man before or since, & how could Claudette Colbert, (or any other woman?), not fall in love with him. Against her father's (Walter Connolly) wishes Ellie Andrews (Colbert) has married newspaper magnate King Westley (Jameson Thomas) & after an argument she jumps her rich fathers yacht into the sea & swims to shore. She is wearing a long white silk gown & not carrying a handbag. Next we see her at Miami bus station purchasing a ticket to New York to be with her husband, complete with a new outfit & handbag! Even allowing for a few plot absurdities this is a movie with a big heart & is very entertaining. On board the bus she meets Peter Warne (Clark Gable) who is a newspaper reporter. When the bus makes a meal stop at Jacksonville Ellie has her handbag stolen leaving her with just 4 dollars. Peter now gets wind of who she is, the runaway daughter heiress of a millionaire father & he senses a good story. After they get back on board the bus Ellie sits next to a rather comical man named Oscar Shapeley (Roscoe Karns), who is an incessant chatterbox who has a habit of saying ""believe you me"". After getting tired of him she tells him, ""Believe you me, you bore me to distraction"". On this night there is a heavy rainstorm outside & the bus is forced to make an overnight stop. Peter hires out a chalet at a campsite & he tells the owner that he & Ellie are a married couple. When she protests he points out to Ellie that after the theft of most of her money they cannot afford ""separate establishments"". He attaches a length of rope across the centre of their chalet & drapes a blanket over it as a room divider which he calls ""the walls of Jericho"". ""That I suppose makes everything quite alright"" she tells him. Peter Warne now admits to her that he is a reporter & has latched on to Ellie Andrews because he senses a good story. He knows her real husband King Westley very well & tells her, ""That guy is a phoney. If I were you I would take the next bus back to Miami"". What follows is a movie that is chock full of memorably entertaining scenes & I guarantee that if anyone is feeling a bit low this film will improve their mood. Highly recommended.",

Even if we consider the age of the film, it's just annoying and distracting all the time with its characters' outdated crappy behaviour. It's still a fun film that can be remembered for being the first in a lot of things but not one of the greatest films in a long shot. Iconic moments alone doesn't make a film great, it should stand the test of time. This film stands the test of time in certain aspects and fails in certain others.

But on the other hand, I am watching this in 2022 in the context of all the other films that I've seen and as such I rate ""It happened One Night"" a 5/10.

180,30 June 2010,gelman@attglobal.net,8," See It for Capra, Gable and Colbert","To modern sensibilities, ""It Happened One Night"" is a tame cliché of a love story. Although tabbed as a classic ""screwball comedy,"" in fact it lacks the essentials of that genre. It is neither as funny nor as romantic as the best of the screwball comedies. The end is visible from the beginning, and the road from start to finish doesn't travel a route that is particularly entertaining. Nonetheless, this is a landmark film of the 1930's and it deploys three of the great talents of that era: Frank Capra as director and Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert as the two hostile personalities who eventually fall in love. I never thought much of Gable when I was young but my mother often said he was the handsomest man alive. Colbert also pales alongside contemporary sexpots yet she was considered one of the most beautiful of the stars (back in the days when Stars were Stars). And Capra was considered a master movie-maker in his day. Although tame by contemporary standards, ""It Happened One Night"" is worth viewing as a milestone of an earlier era. Bearing in mind the limited technical resources available at the time and the no-sex code imposed by the Hays Office, I think it's worth 8 out of 10.",

184,16 August 2005,silverscreen888,8, Classic Comedy About Sheltered Female and Strong Male=TNT,"This script by Robert Riskin I find to be filled with excellent dialogue; This is an unpretentious but very idea-level social satire, involving the unlikely pairing of no-nonsense Clark Gable with classically-trained charismatic Claudette Colbert. The second unlikeliness about the film is the princess-like Colbert, being barred by her magnate father from consummating a secret marriage, jumping off the yacht where she is being confined and ending up being spotted by newsman Gable. He is in fact portrayed as the usual late-twenties hard-drinking no-nonsense reporter sort with three exceptions--he is adventurous, able to get along and function effectively at all levels of society even during the Depresssion, and he is working in a profession where there is no job-level between managing editor and field reporter; this all leaves him frustrated by dull or routine assignments but wanting to investigate and do something important in the world. Only the wealth of Colbert's father qualifies her as important. Once he befriends her, and agrees to get her where she wants to go, the added complication comes from their attraction for one another, a slowly growing and smoldering subtext to what they actually do. He disapproves of her; she disapproves of him. He represents, it appears to me, reality--what she has been denied every bit as much as any European princess (""The Princess Comes Across"", ""Roman Holiday"") has been denied it; and he is a natural leader shut out from the upper levels of society and thus denied also; and he is the natural leader/mental aristocrat by ability denied her worlds of unobstructed goal-setting, doing one's one desires and not having to be disbarred from anything. As no one I know has noticed, then, this is a European story-line grafted onto a supposedly classless U.S., every bit as much so as is ""Destry Rides Again"" or ""Roman Scandals"". That I suggest is the secret to ""It Happened One Night"" and its strong story-line; it is a film about Gable's personal purpose of doing a good story for his career's sake and having it turned upside down by his falling in love with what Colbert ought-to-be, could be, and is becoming. The ""Walls of Jericho"" business involving the erecting of a curtain so Colbert will feel safe spending the night with Gable is a charming device for comedic purposes, as is Gable's removing his shirt as a symbol of reality-sexuality being offered to Colbert, the last thing she immediately wants to deal with. In another sense, the Walls are protecting him, the realist, from immediately having to deal with her higher-value-sexual meaning rather than her story-value to him as a reporter. The cleverness of the dialogue, picaresque adventures, human encounters and interactions depicted in the movie all magnify its importance again. And the fact that these are all beautifully presented by director Frank Capra and his technicians further increases their ability to affect an audience. The couple's different ways of handling people, the dunking of a donut, and the classic triumph of the bared female leg (hers) over hitchhiking expertise (his) at promoting them a ride become symbols of the natural triumphing over the artificial. over ""barriers"". And when the time comes for Ellie Andrews (Colbert) to decide whether she wants to stay married to one King Westley or divorce or marry Peter Warne (Gable), we the viewers have been well-informed as to what decision she will be making. This is a screwball-type comedy due to the unpredictable reactions of many persons to the Depression's unnatural restraints and emergencies. The basic situation--the princess-cheerleader female and the rough-hewn-commoner male has been carried out many times, but never with more success since the film's release; but this is essentially a European plot line grafted onto a U.S. stature-through-ability individualism; this is why so many attempts at this formula have failed, I suggest; because the formula was not understood, and because the united States has been increasingly unAmerican since 1902, particularly since 1937. The other interesting and important aspect I find as a writer is that Gable does not know who this waif is at the beginning; so we find that Gable's character is a commoner who deserves to be an important man, a first-rate newspaperman frustrated by his inability to chart his own course, a man who likes people who lives in a rough, noir-like environment, and a man who likes women and wants an equal but has to play mentor to a desirable woman only slowly realizing her potential. This is the ""ice-goddess"" aspect of the rich explored in ""The Phildaelphia Story"" by Philip Barry; Gable's problem is that of the great man stuck in a tsar-ridden society, familiar from ""Holiday"", ""The Big Sleep"" and ""The Fountainhead"" among others. The film I find is a delight; its dated aspects are those of its technologically backward period only. Its strengths appear to me to be derived from its honest plot and many interesting characters. Both leads are self-regulating; he lives by a moral code, and during the film she discovers the need for one. They seem to be an excellent match, when all is said and done. The evils of the Depression, which socialist Capra might have stressed even more than he does, are used very cleverly here as a background to the personal self-discovery mutual story-line. This is a well-photographed and artistic effort, I suggest, but nothing as stylish as Capra's later efforts. Cinematography by Joseph Walker, art direction by Stephen Goosson, and Robert Kalloch's costumes, with brief music only being provided all add to the realistic sense of the two character's descent from riches or daily reality and their immersion in the wider meaning of a nation in social upheaval and economic distress. In the cast the viewer should note Walter Connolly as Colbert's exasperated banker father, Roscoe Karns, Ward Bond, Alan Hale, Arthur Hoyt, Jameson Roberts, Harry Hume, Milton Kibbee and many more persons effective in brief parts. This is a well-designed movie, very deserving of its popularity.",
185,19 September 2011,gigan-92,10," ""What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?""","Director Frank Capra's ""It Happened One Night"" (1934) was deemed ""culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant"" by the Library of Congress in 1993, and for that it was preserved in the National Film Registry. It is an honor few films have received, considering only 550 out of the hundreds of thousands of films America has produced since film's birth long ago. This is rightfully so, as the film is a masterpiece on many levels and despite being nearly eighty years old watching it today it still doesn't feel dated at all. Its humor is golden, there being so many classic lines I've heard them quoted so many times in other productions and in everyday life even. Not only that but it was a blue print for future films of a similar genre, the romantic comedy everyone's come to know and love, and its influence is unmistakable as well as undeniable. The film encompasses many aspects of the classic screwball comedy that was prominent in the 30s and 40s. Though elements of the subgenre have survived on for years in modern comedy, the screwball comedy of the early twentieth century represented a specific point in American history. Take for instance Claudette Colbert's character, Ellie. Besides being beautiful, she is intelligent, especially compared to the minor male characters. We see this in the opening scenes and one of our initial reactions may be to think of her as nothing more than a spoiled brat. However, the clever writing uses her somewhat awkward and clumsy nature amongst the everyday people and bus travelers not only as comedy, but as a way to draw sympathy for the character. We soon see that she is alone in her plight, and so arrives the charming Peter Warren, played by Clark Gable. ",

210,17 December 2022,VikingBurialService,9, Great Early Rom-Com,"Probably the best romantic comedy movie I've seen. Basically, a spoiled heiress runs away from her father and meets a down-and-out newspaper reporter, and together they travel across the united states. Lots of elements in this movie are surprisingly well-done for a movie from the 30s. The soundtrack is pleasant, and doesn't blow out my ears with trumpets or strings. The acting is a little campy-early-movie, but again it doesn't take me out of it. Many of the scenarios (the singing driver, the song on the bus, the fake-hitman scene) actually had me laughing 90 years after its release. Even a few of the camera shots (the tracking ones) were impressive. Some of the editing wasn't great, but that's a product of the time. Overall, a fun rom-com.",
211,21 July 2005,hthesmith_99,10, This is a great movie,"""It Happened One Night"" may be a movie for its times, but its humor, its tenderness, its ""love for the little guy"" and its interesting detail of what life on the road was like in the 1930's, makes this movie so watchable 71 years later. Not too many flicks can withstand the test of time, but I suppose the ""battle of the sexes"" genre that permeates ""It Happened One Night"" and the honest dialog that fills the script can still resonate with us (it does me)so many years later. It was made before Hollywood explored the dark side of life and so ""It Happened One Night"" does not tell you much about the grimmer aspects of the 1930's. It only briefly alludes to the joblessness and hunger that many people experienced (a woman faints on the bus, and there's a train full of hobos), and does not touch race relations during those years whatsoever. Instead, in no maudlin way, it seems to try to show that there is decency in everyone, from a hustling reporter looking for a scoop, to a rich heiress trying to find happiness in her own right. That they should find love in each other, despite their differences, is what makes the movie so hopeful. If that's too naive for some to stomach, the sophisticated humor in such scenes as the Walls Of Jericho and the donut dunking lesson, help ground the movie in some reality. ",

With many twists throughout movie that changed way of movie plot and pushed us in new direction they had to deal with a lot of and find comfort in each other. At the end she run away from her real husband and gave us really incredible ending. Gable as Peter was absolutely great, as he is sincere, but also cares for Elie and finally falls in love. Claudette Colbert as Ellen was incredible as she deals with doubts but also wants to continue her adventure in presence of Peter and giving a heartfelt performance. Originality of script with dialogues that are amazing and moving and scenes that it created. Comedic aspect of the movie is very good but there is not much for audience to catch onto. 3.5/4",
213,20 December 2012,Larry41OnEbay-2,10, Here are my notes from when I last introduced it on the big screen...2/2,"This is part two of my two part introduction: ... Another unexpected accident came years later when legendary Warner Bros. animator Tex Avery told the story of how he came up with the idea for Bugs Bunny by watching Clark Gable eat carrots in IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT! A sound man on the film later told Capra the story of how he over-heard Colbert complaining to Gable about making the film (she thought it her worst) and Gable defended Capra saying he Gable was having a blast and that Capra was on to something. Well they finished the film on time and it opened at Radio City Music Hall where it only played for one week. The reviews were good but mixed and the box office not as strong as Capra's previous movie LADY FOR A DAY. Then – it happened. Happened all over the country – not in one night, but within a month. People took longer to find the film, in the Midwest, in small towns, the word of mouth spread and surprise it was funnier, much funnier than usual. But, the biggest surprise of all, they could remember in detail a good deal of what went on in the film and they found everybody else did and that it was great fun talking about this and that scene. And let's go see it again and take the neighbors. The quietness burst into the proverbial prairie fire. Theaters sold out for weeks and weeks. Critics went back for a second look, a third, a fourth.Astonishingly enough, the news about It Happened One Night was not that it made Classic status but that it got made at all. Oh and buy the way it, was the first film to sweep all five of the major Academy Awards and the only one for 48 years! Colbert did not want to even attend the Oscars so she went in travelling clothes, seems she was leaving that night to go on that vacation she missed. So when her name was called she ran up grabbed the award, said thanks and dashed out the door only to STOP. Turn around. Go back up on to the stage to the microphone and added, ""I owe Frank Capra for this."" Gable said the same. Meanwhile, my favorite director Mr. Frank R. Capra went on to have a wonderful life. I used to call him at his home on his birthday (he was in the phone book) to thank him for making this film, and then MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, LOST HORIZON, YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU, MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, MEET JOHN DOE and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. I used to call him on my birthday too. I told him watching his films again, was my present to me.

I liked how each was mistaken at the end (but are brought together by her father). Gable was great in this movie-it reminded me a bit of Carey Grant in His Girl Friday-the cynical newspaperman who really just wants to get the story (and the girl).

Above all else, I've notice a lot of women who love to comment over the most famous scene in the film in which Clark Gable takes off his shirt and exposes his bare chest. I'm surprised, after all the other good-looking heartthrobs that have come and gone since Gable, women are still admiring his muscular physique. MY favorite scene however, is when Claudette Colbert brings the cocky Gable down a peg or two and puts him in his place when she hails a cab with those nice gams of hers. He spends the rest of the trip down the highway sulking over how a woman beat him at his own game of hitchhiking. Well, it serves him right. Also, I want to punch (no, KICK) him right in the face whenever he dictates to how and what she spends her money on. The jerk obviously thought he owned her or something. I'm not a feminist or anything, I'm just old-fashioned to a certain extent and think that a guy should be a gentleman to a lady and not boss her around. If a man bossed a woman around these days he would have gotten his teeth knocked in, or worse.

The actors that can be a good Clark Gable would be Will Ferrell, Aston Kutchner, Alex D. Linz, Chad Michael Murray, Owen Wilson, Jon Heder or Ben Stiller.

Any classic movie lover would be hard-pressed to deny the charm of this film. As enjoyable as any of Capra's best, I Happened One Night is one of those rare films that is a joy to watch, simply for its entertainment value. Clark Gable stars as Peter Worne, a hard-nosed reporter, who just got the pink slip from his job when he runs into Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), the daughter of millionaire Alexander Andrews. Having run away from her father, Ellie is trying to get to New York to be with her husband, King Westley (Jameson Thomas). Smelling a story, Worne decides it may be best for both of them to stick together for a while. What the newsman doesn't count on is that he may see more to Ellie than what he had counted on. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert play off of each other wonderfully throughout the movie, displaying a the chemistry between stars that makes a movie a classic. The achievements of the Capra and company did not go unnoticed during Oscar season, either. It Happened One Night made Oscar history as being the first film to sweep the five major categories at the Academy Awards, a feat that would not occur again until One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest did it in 1975. Aside from winning Best Picture, the film also took in Best Director (Frank Capra), Best Actor (Clark Gable), Best Actress (Claudette Colbert), and Best Screenplay (Robert Riskin).

It's a competently made film with good production design and solid actors working on it. But the rotten core of this film is with its two main characters and how they unnecessarily complicate the story. The movie has actually had a pretty good setup as a woman, Ellen played by Claudette Colbert, betrothed to a king runs from her father to be with her fiancé. Upon going bus to bus to get there, she meets Clark Gable's character named Peter who's an egotistical, newspaper man. At first their chemistry is fun. But where this movie really started rubbing me the wrong way is how controlling Peter is towards Claudette. I get it, it's old-fashioned but with the demeanor Gable gives the character, it feels unhealthy. She doesn't seem to enjoy it either, nor does she hint or explicitly say so. For a character that made an active decision in escaping from her father, she doesn't play an active role through nearly the rest of the movie. Like I said, Peter takes her and pretty much dictates all her actions their on till a certain point til' the end. Their chemistry mainly involves them being snappy with each other. I felt no amount of dialogue or character actions made me learn anything new or significant about these characters. Therefore, I struggled to make a connection with them. Plus, there are many problems in the story that felt very contrived and forced (especially towards the end). So many of these problems feel like they can be solved with simple character dialogue. ",

Ellie sells her watch for money to buy clothes the heads to a bus so she can ride to her Fiancé (Her father doesn't know about this marriage) King Westley. She sits next to a reporter/journalist named Peter Warne. Peter starts to get onto her as he notices she didn't report to the police after getting her purse stolen. He finds out what's happening between her and her dad and uses it as blackmail saying he will tell her father/the cops if she doesn't cooperate. If she does cooperate with traveling with him then he will bring her to her husband. As they continue to travel, they mutually start to flirt and fall in love with each other, but both of them are too scared to tell the other and admit to it. Later on Ellie tells Peter her feelings about him and Peter reacts coldly about it. Ellie is heart broken about this and goes to sleep. While she's asleep Peter leaves and goes to NYC to to write up a story about their affair for $1,000 with the plan of driving back to Ellie so he can propose to her. Ellie gets woken up early and thinks that Peter ditched her, so she calls her dad and King Westley to come get her. Peter returns to the cabin to see that Ellie is gone and believes he also got rejected. Ellie tells her dad about Peter and her dad calls Peter her to have a meeting about the $10,000 reward, Peter doesn't accept it tells him that he loves his daughter.

It Happened One Night follows a spoiled heiress and a reporter who found her as she was running away from her father. They make a deal, she will give him the story of her if he gets her to New York. The story is fun and playful and you are constantly routing for this unlikely couple. They are continuously getting themselves into, and some how out of, these hilarious situations on their travels. Whether it be them escaping from detectives or the two of them hitchhiking, but what makes these scenes so fun to watch is their crazy and flirtatious ways out.

She finds herself hiding on a bus sitting next to down- on-his luck reporter Peter Warne, deftly played by wise cracking Clark Gable. The story takes off in funny and memorable predicaments for this unlikely couple. Both Ellie and Peter are fiercely independent with their personal goals on the line and yet they are forced to completely depend on each other. Peter is not about to let his lead story escape and she needs him to help her get to New York and ""Westley,"" the weasel husband she married in haste who is only interested in her money. In the meantime, an array of colorful characters including Ellie's father bent on annulling her phony marriage, help make this film a wonderful screwball comedy. This Frank Capra film is the original road trip story packed with fast paced dialogue by Robert Riskin who won the Oscar for best screenplay. Gable and Colbert also deliver great performances that garnered both of them Academy awards! When they find themselves stranded off the road, Peter teaches ""Brat"" (Ellie) the art of hitchhiking. It is a classic scene, as he fails miserably until cool and collected Ellie succeeds in stopping a car by lifting her skirt and exposing her leg. Clark Gable munching a carrot with his mouth full in a fast talking performance according to Friz Freleng and Chuck Jones of Warner Brothers cartoons admitted was the inspiration for another iconic character, Bugs Bunny! ""It happened one Night"" is sheer joy to watch and director Frank Capra is at his best. This 1934 gem is why so many other films that came later, copied and recreated so many famous scenes from ""It Happened One Night."" With very little money, Peter and Ellie register as a married couple to get a room only to hoist a blanket between the two beds;""the walls of Jericho."" This is another classic scene and a turning point in the story for the two sparring characters who are falling in love. Even funnier is when detectives hired by Ellies' father, close in on the couple at the motel and they improvise a domestic argument to fool them, only to burst out laughing when the coast is clear. ""It Happened One Night"" is the first film to win 5 Academy awards including Best Picture.

Clark Gable plays an even more insufferable pretty boy than his usual shtick and Claudette Colbert plays a melodramatic archetype of the hysterical damsel. I hate both of them and I kept wishing that they would both get caught and the movie would just end so it would stop trying to get me to root for them. Detracting from my hatred a bit, however, is some very nice cinematography as well as some interesting and neat ways of incorporating the Great Depression setting without detracting from the main story. Some of the jokes landed quite nicely although most of them were either too dated or portrayed with too much hammy acting to get a laugh or even a chuckle. I'd give it a 4.5/10 as well as a sticker of essential American Cinema since I now know the origin of about a dozen running gags in current film and television.",

Gable never more gentlemanly than the gates of Jericho scene, in a nutshell just a beautiful movie and my all time favorite!!!",

Anyway, this was a magnificent film, that unfortunately stops just short of being a masterpiece when Colbert and Grant no longer are on the road and Capra tries to wrap it up in a satisfying manner, only partly succeeding.",

259,24 October 2011,aysx87,7, Old-fashioned and a bit scandalous at once,"This is supposed to be a screwball comedy, but it was so dramatic it kept me on edge almost the entire time--will she go back to her husband? Is he going to make it back in time? What about everyone else who helped them on this crazy journey? Is she going to say 'I do?' wow! It's old-fashioned in the way women are depicted (colbert spends a lot of her time sobbing and freaking out, while clark gable plays the unmoved, exasperated, in control, wise-cracking, eye-rolling man), the way people talk, and the way 'trashy' relationships and hitchhiking is depicted ('see? i told you they were a nice couple!' still cracks me up.) Yet at the same time, it was surprisingly racy. Apparently a moral code was passed a year after this was released, so we see scenes like unmarried people sleeping in the same room, almost-kissing, cuddling, and one v. shapely leg exhibited during the famous hitchhiking scene. It's great. It's a very beautiful movie; the hay scene with lighting in particular reminds me of Casablanca, and Colbert looks beautiful and very sleek in all scenes; it's like the Inception of the 1930s.",

The strength of this movie other than its sharp plot lies in the sizzling chemistry between the two lead stars . Gable and Colbert simply glow every time they appear on screen together. The simple plot of a spoiled runaway girl who befriends and eventually falls for a smart mouth reporter while ironically riding on a bus trip to meet the man whom she thinks she loves is pure genius. The old cliché is very apt over here and it can truly be said that they don't make em like they used to.

Is very important to point out that the movie, because of its honesty, brings upon a few harsh sexist ideas as any romance from the 30's would. I think we as an audience should pay close attention to that as it reflects our modern culture even to these days therefore not to view it with contemporary disregard.

282,27 May 2019,MEMYSELFVEENA,8, OUTSTANDING !!!,"Director Frank Capra (It's A Wonderful Life) delivers another top notch film that has a really simple storyline. It is basically a 1930s rom com! Setting the template for the genre for decades. Its stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert form an unlikely couple. Colbert a spoilt brat heiress about to marry someone in New York. Gable a failing newspaper reporter who needs a scoop to boost his flagging career. In an era before interstate air travel the pair travel from Miami, Florida to New York via a nightbus and several stops en route. Its interesting how simple life seemed in the depression era U.S. in this film. No freeways with thousands of cars hurtling past! Just quiet backroads with the occassional car. The film is an early road movie as well as rom com. Very little is set in one single location. Just the odd motel rooms, the nightbus and exterior shots. Gable seems to revel in his role as a bit of a scally that differs from his more stiff upper lip roles in films such as Gone With The Wind. The film was a great success winning several Academy Awards including the big 5 (Director, Actor, Actress, Best Picture and Screenplay). Few films (only three to date) have achieved such an accolade. For the first ten minutes I was like this is really dated and will be boring, however on reflection you can see its appeal. Bravo again Mr. Capra.
Hindi remakes were made like Dil Hai ki Manta Nahi and Jab we met. But my favorite remains this one.",
283,25 December 2018,SambitMishra95,9, Best Movie,"Probably the fluffiest Best Picture winner I've ever seen. The only thing gritty about it is Capra's intense hatred of wealth being put out front and center.

287,18 June 2016,saamejlali,6, Class warfare,"In the scene (first ""walls of Jericho,"") from the movie 'It Happened One Night' directed by Frank Capra, we see Ellie standing outside during the night in a pouring rain. The narrative/story or the plot unfolds like this. The passengers are forced by a storm to spend the night in an auto court and Ellie has had her suitcase stolen not too long ago and she has very little money to afford a room. Peter knows this because he tried to retrieve her suitcase from the thief but was unable to do so. Thus in order to help Ellie, he rents a room at the auto court under both their names and claims her as his wife. Ellie is somewhat surprised by this, but the shock is softened both for the audience at the time (1934,) and for Ellie, because in the earlier scene Peter helped Ellie to deflect an annoying guy on the buss named Shapeley, by claiming her as his wife. When Ellie enters the room she is somewhat dismay by having to have to spend the night with a strange man. ""According to Colbert, this was the only time in the rapid shooting schedule that he redid something, because he had decided she didn't look 'scared enough.'"" pg.44, last paragraph, Runaway Bride, Hollywood Romantic Comedy of the 1930's, Elizabeth Kendall, Alfred A. Knopf, New York 1990 Keep in mind that for 1930's this was a big deal. The film is going against dominant ideologies at this time and they have to thread carefully. They are going against the norms. If one pays close attention, you notice the beds are separated from each other, even though the room is registered for couples. This is due to the influence of the evangelicals at the time. And the fact that they would have boycotted the movie if the beds were seen together. (class notes, professor Goldberg, Summer 2015) The beds are the first thing that captures Ellies attention once she enters the room. We get a POV shot of her looking at Peter making the bed for her in a low key lighting. What is to follow is witty comments going back and forth between Ellie and Peter as we get establishing and re-establishing shots of the room. Ellie is trying to find out about Peters intentions and Peter is trying to get Ellie to stay. Not only because he likes her, but because he also needs her story to get his job back. It is at this moment that Ellie finds out about his occupation. In order to gain her trust he assures here that he is not interested in her sexually and that she is ""just a headline"" to him. Then Peter puts up the rope in the middle of the room and uses a blanket to make the 'wall of Jericho,' according to Peter. He does this to gain her trust. But the situation is till tense. This is when the director Capra, ""broke the pathos with some comic relief"" and had Peter taking off his clothes to force Ellie to her side of the room. pg.45, first paragraph, Runaway Bride, Hollywood Romantic Comedy of the 1930's, Elizabeth Kendall, Alfred A. Knopf, New York 1990 Then we get a pan shot of Ellie running to her side of the room and looking baffled that she has to put up with him. To further seal the deal as if she has no option but to spend the night in this room with this man, we get a silhouette shot of her lifting up the curtain and looking out at the window at the pouring rain. The movie does a great job of getting the audience of the 1930's engaged in the class warfare between the rich and poor by making it as if the rich girls (Ellie) needs the poor guy to survive on the streets, but yet at the same time the poor guy (Peter) needing Ellie to survive. The way the movie does this is by going against the traditional gender role and the dominant ideologies of male masculinities, through a role reversal. Peter, the poor guy is putting Ellie on a budget and rationing her breakfast. But the glue that holds the movie together and acceptable for the audience at the time, is the sexual tension between the two characters. Nonmatter the class difference or gender difference, the one thing that all of them and the audience have in common is sex.",
