1,23 December 2003,Quinoa1984,10," One of my favorite westerns- a fitting middle section to the ""Dollars"" trilogy","As the second of the three films legendary filmmaker Sergio Leone collaborated on with Clint Eastwood (not to mention his first with Lee Van Cleef and his second with 'Fistful' actor Gian Maria Volonte), For a Few Dollars More gets well earned respect from the fans of the director and the groundbreaking star. And yet, occasionally there are those who'll not even know this film from Leone and Clint exists since it does sometimes get under the shadow of their two most infamous works, Fistful of Dollars (which for the most part introduced Clint and Leone to the public's awareness) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (which solidified Clint as a Western icon and gave Leone a similar status for film buffs). But taken as a film unto itself, aside from its place in the trilogy, this is a Western that simply delivers the goods, and it does so with a spectacular marriage of style and substance. ",r
2,30 August 2012,TheLittleSongbird,10," Not as good as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly but better than A Fistful of Dollars","Just for the record I happen to love all three films. For a Few Dollard More is an amazing film though perhaps not as influential as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. There is one improvement over that film though, and that is the writing of Clint Eastwood's character, more developed and more compelling. A Fistful of Dollars is also great because of everything that makes TGTBATU and FAFDM so good, but I do consider the other two more influential on the genre and also Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which used the film as its inspiration, to be the superior film. Back to A Few Dollars More, the stylised visuals are stunning to look at, the scenery is the very definition of epic and the cinematography sweeps. Ennio Morricone's score is both elegiac and operatic in tone and the story of greed and revenge that focuses mainly on the pursuit of bandit Indio draws you right in and never lets go. The dialogue is peppered with grit and dark humour, which is well-balanced with neither over-powering the other, while Leone's direction is superb. Clint Eastwood plays his more developed character with immense charisma, Lee Van Cleef is suitably vengeful and again Gian Maria Volonte snarls convincingly. Overall, a wonderful film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",e
3,11 October 2015,ivo-cobra8,10, The best classic spaghetti western in the Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood trilogy!,"For a Few Dollars More (1965) is the best Clint Eastwood Western movie and one of my favorite personal classic western flicks ever! It is my third favorite in ""The Man with No Name"" Trilogy. I grew up watching this film and it was the first Clint Eastwood western movie I ever saw, I fall immediately in love with it and I just love this movie. It is Sergio Leone's best western film of all time my favorite. It is entraining and brilliant western flick with a great original epic story, great cast and the acting is fantastic. You have a great shoot outs, the music score is original epic. I always enjoy this film. It is my favorite Eastwood western movie. ",v
4,4 July 2006,jluis1984,9, The finest example of the Spaghetti Western revolution,"Italian director Sergio Leone changed the face of the Western genre in 1964 when he introduced what would be known as the ""Spaghetti Western"" with the brilliant ""Per un Pugno di Dollari"" (""A Fistful of Dollars""). Not only the films looked grittier, violent and realistic; the characters in Leone's westerns became complex men with complex and obscure moral codes, very far away from the classic clear moral opposites of previous westerns. ""Per Qualche Dollaro in più"" (""For a few dollars more""), is the epitome of all this. It is a powerful, raw and ruthless masterpiece that transcended its genre and became one of the best movies of all-time.",i
5,10 October 2002,funkyfry,9, Worth more than a fistful of dollars,"Excellent fun with sadistic humor from Leone.  Eastwood's best performance in a Leone film.  Van Cleef is good in a role similar to Chuck Bronson's in ""Once Upon a Time in the West"".  He is menacing and sympathetic, whereas in ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" he is just campy and all ""bad guy"" (but still fun).  What makes both performances so memorable I think is that Van Cleef seems to be in touch with Leone's dark humor, where Eastwood is used as a straight man.  Volonte is also excellent in the bandito role Leone used (an example of a standard European character type who reminds the audience of earthiness and the basic ignorance and greed of man).  A much better film than most people who've seen it on a Saturday afternoon on TV probably realize -- you have to see these movies in the theater to get the full hit.",e
6,4 July 2006,planktonrules,9, A terrific film--one of the best of the Italian Westerns,"The film begins as you see Lee Van Cleef tracking down and killing wanted men. He is so cold, calculating and non-emotional that he is perhaps one of the creepiest heroes in Westerns. Then, the action switches to Eastwood--doing pretty much the same thing, though with a bit more bravado and a little less menace. Both men are bounty hunters and apparently are nearly unstoppable. Then, the film switches to a prison break, where ""El Loco"" is being extracted as his gang wipes out almost everyone in the prison.",w

8,7 March 2014,iamyuno2,9, One of Best Westerns Ever Made,"Exceptional performances by three heavyweight actors, Gian Maria Volonte and Lee Van Cleef - both of whom, it's a shame, did not have all that many more opportunities to shine in quality films after this one - and Clint Eastwood, along with taut direction, editing, cinematography and gripping and unique music (by the great Ennio Morricone), make this movie a real standout. (The music's almost a major character in this film, in fact.) Stylistically iconic, this Sergio Leone opus has an endlessly fascinating and spellbinding story that surprises to the end. Plus, we really come to like the co-heroes, Van Cleef and Eastwood - we want to befriend them and emulate them. Volonte was priceless as a demonic villain - his facial expressions rich with narcissism and a strange kind of violence-fueled euphoria no one else has ever matched in film history, for my money. Though he clashed with director Leone and purportedly did not like the Western genre, Volonte's performance rises above the film's genre and could be favorably compared to the best portrayed villains of other more mainstream movies. Volonte brought a realism to his character and an intensity you don't see in many films. But so did Van Cleef, whose work in this film is incredible. You'd have thought other movie makers would have rushed to cast Van Cleef in important roles after this film, but no. Very strange. Though some might question the wanton violence in this film, the truth is that the real wild west was even more violent and the violence often much more capricious and random. Like all great artistic works, this film never grows old for me. I am always drawn to watch it again and again for it is of such a depth and complexity that it only reveals more of itself with each viewing.",r

This is mainly because a higher budget is evident, especially in the better cast.

The epitome of the SW is violent, beautifully crafted and exaggerated , it pits crafty ¨Man with no name¨ though named Manco (Clint Eastwood) and shifty Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef as old man , however in reality Clint was already 35 and Lee only 40 when was filmed ) forming an uneasy alliance against badder guy named Indio (Gian Maria Volonte ) but their reasons to pursuit him are totally different .

15,28 May 2017,BA_Harrison,7, The return of the man with no name.,"For his follow up to spaghetti western classic A Fistful of Dollars, director Sergio Leone serves up more of the same, with lots of squinty eyed heroics, cigar chomping and twitchy trigger fingers. This time around, Clint Eastwood's impossibly cool 'man with no name' teams up with fellow bounty killer Col.

17,3 August 2005,axopnk,9, Great Western! Awesome on all levels,"This movie is the second best western i have ever seen with The Good, The Bad, The Ugly being first. I disagree with someone who wrote that this movie is not as good as A Fistful of Dollars. This movie is way better than a fistful of dollars. The reason is (as i pointed out in my other post) is that Clint's role or character is better when he has a good supporting member because it gives Clint's character more depth as well as throw a wild card into the mix. Lee van clef is excellent in his role, i still have him labeled as the bad but it was surprising to see him play a good guy in this one. Both bounty hunters have their own styles which meshes really good on the screen. Gian had more depth to this one which played perfectly into Lee Van Clefs character. In a fistful of dollars Gian didn't have much depth at all and some of the characters were annoying. I like how leone tied all of the characters into each other in this one, having all of their stories somehow play a role in the other ones. If you haven't seen this movie i suggest you watch Leone's films in chronological order with A fistful of dollars first, this one second, and finish it off with the good the bad the ugly. You'll be glad you did.",/

21,29 December 2011,Red-Barracuda,8, The template Spaghetti Western,"The second film in Sergio Leone's 'Dollars Trilogy' is a definite progression from A Fistful of Dollars. Utilizing many of the same cast members, Leone's follow up is more layered and stylised than before. It was the most successful Italian film of its time and remained so into the early 70's. For this reason its probably fair to say that more than any other movie, this was the definitive template of the Spaghetti Western genre. Its story of mean bad guys and mean good guys entwined in a revenge plot was mimicked several times in other Italian movies. Leone, however, was the master of this sub-genre and in this film he begins to really show why. It's paced magnificently and is consistently visually arresting. It exhibits many of the director's recurring imagery - extreme close-ups, scenes of operatic violence and an eye for interesting faces. But of course, this is only part of the story because what would these films be without the contribution of Ennio Morricone? The soundtrack maestro is once again on peerless form and the score is quite brilliant. It's unthinkable to imagine Leone's films without the contribution of this musical genius. Similarly, the cast add good value. Clint Eastwood is a solid presence but he is overshadowed by Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Douglas Mortimer – despite being top billed Eastwood often essentially played second fiddle to his co-star, think also of Eli Wallach in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The villains are also very good too. Gian Maria Volonté is always compelling as the chief psychopath, what with his mixture of physical menace and psychological damage. But perhaps best of all is Klaus Kinski as the unforgettable hunchback bandit. He is criminally under used, however.",f
22,7 July 2017,lee_eisenberg,10, I'll wager you a dollar,"The second installment of Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy has the Man with No Name and a colonel teaming up to stop an outlaw. ""Per qualche dollaro in più"" (""A Few Dollars More"" in English) naturally lets Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef do their stuff, but I think that a lot of the credit should go to Gian Maria Volontè as the ruthless criminal El Indio. I'm talking one nasty dude. As is the case with ""A Fistful of Dollars"", there's not much dialogue, just subtle action. Eastwood's face does as much talking as any dialogue.",_

29,25 May 2008,zardoz-13,10, An Undisputed Sergio Leone Classic!,"Sergio Leone's superlative ""For a Few Dollars More"" with Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Gian Maria Volonte ranks in the top five of all Spaghetti westerns. This exciting bounty hunter shoot'em up has Monco (Clint Eastwood) forming an uneasy alliance with Carolina-bred Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) to wipe out a ruthless gang of murderous desperadoes. Monco wants the bounty on El Indio (Gian Maria Volonte of ""A Bullet for the General"") and his gang, while Colonel Mortimer vows to kill Indio strictly out of revenge. It seems that Indio tried to rape Mortimer' sister and she shot herself with Indio's revolver. A multitude of distinctive Leone touches appear in this fabulous frontier saga; this represents the first time that Leone would stage a gunfight in the round. Meanwhile, Ennio Morricone's theme music is classic with its chiming bells, piercing whistles, and crisp sounding cracks of a whip, but it is the tender and moving watch-piece theme that is really memorable here. Again, the action takes place in the craggy mountainous regions of Spain that substitute marvelously for the American southwest. Every time that a six-gun toting character tramps the gritty earth with his jingling, spur-clad boots, you can hear the scratchy sound of dirt being displaced. The sets seem so much more authentic the way that they have been grafted to the spartan scenery.",v

Basically, a ""Man with No Name"", known by some as Manco (Clint Eastwood), is a bounty hunter, a profession shared by a former army officer, Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef). Eventually, the two learn that ruthless, cold-blooded bank robber El Indio (Gian Maria Volontè) has been broken out of prison by his gang, and many of the jailers have been slaughtered. Indio carries a musical pocket watch, a flashback reveals that he took it from a young woman (Rosemary Dexter), who shot herself after he raped her and murdered her husband. The incident has haunted Indio, and he smokes an addictive drug to cloud his memory. Indio plans to rob the Bank of El Paso. The Stranger arrives in the town and becomes aware of Mortimer, they study each other and are initially resentful of each other. But as neither intends to back down they decide to work together. Mortimer persuades the Stranger to get closer to Indio by joining his gang. The Stranger achieves this by freeing a friend of Indio's from prison despite Indio's suspicions. Indio sends the Stranger and three others to rob the bank in nearby Santa Cruz. While the Stranger guns down the three bandits and rouses the sheriff (Tomas Blanco) and his posse, the gang manage to blast the rear wall of the bank and steal the safe but are unable to open it. Indio's gang member Groggy (Luigi Pistilli) is suspicious the Stranger is the only one to return from Santa Cruz, but thanks to a convincing wound from Mortimer, Indio believes the Stranger's version of events. The gang rides to the small border town of Agua Caliente where Mortimer is waiting. The hunchback Wild (Aguirre, the Wrath of God's Klaus Kinski), he is killed when a showdown ensues before Mortimer offers his services to Indio to crack open the safe. Indio locks the money in a strongbox and says that the loot will be divided after a month. Manco and Mortimer break into the strongbox and hide the money, only to be caught and beaten up. Mortimer has secured the strongbox lock, however, and Indio believes that the money is still there. Members of the gang, including Niño (Mario Brega) and Cuchillo (Aldo Sambrell), go against each other to get their hands on the money, whilst Mortimer and the Stranger are freed. Indio convinces Groggy to join forces with him to trap the bounty killers. The next morning, the Stranger and Mortimer shoot down the gang, one by one, in the streets of the town, and Mortimer kills Groggy when he tries to flee. The Stranger sits while Mortimer and Indio have a standoff. The Stranger notices the photograph inside the pocket watch is of the young woman seen in the earlier flashback, it is revealed that it is Mortimer's sister. The showdown ends with Mortimer shooting and killing Indio, and with his vengeance complete, he declines to take any share of the reward for his death. It ends with the Stranger riding away into the distance with his horse towing the wagon full of the lifeless bodies of the entire gang. Also starring Benito Stefanelli as Luke ""Hughie"", and Mara Krupp as Mary, the Hotel Manager's Beautiful Wife. Eastwood as the iconic ""Man with No Name"" remains cool, looking steely eyed in his poncho, smoking cigars, it is said most of his dialogue was cut to make him more mysterious, this sequel helped to continue his international superstardom. The film does have lip-sync and dubbing issues, the story is very up-and-down and slow at times, but for Eastwood, brilliant use of extreme close-ups, the tense showdown sequences, the violence, and the memorable score by Ennio Morricone, this is a fine classic western. Clint Eastwood was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!",

Well...","One of my favorite movie lines of all time as spoken by Klaus Kinski upon recognizing Lee Van Cleef in the little cantina as the one who used his (Klaus') cheek to strike his match earlier in the movie.  When Kinski ask if he ""remember me, amigo,"" Van Cleef just reply ""uh uh.""  To which he's asked to try that trick again, which prompts Van Cleef to utter another one of my all time lines - ""I generally don't smoke 'til after I've eaten; why don't you come back in five minutes.""  Just typing this brings smiles to my face. I've been a Lee Van Cleef fan since High Noon (with Robert Wilke) and Kansas City Confidential (with Jack Elam and Neville Brand!) and this was/is the movie that made him a star.  Granted it didn't last for long, but he did have his 15 minutes.  This is my favorite Spaghetti Western, it was also my first (didn't see ""Fistful"" until much later - and Good, Bad, Ugly was a major disappointment - I wanted Van Cleef to play the same role).

60,3 August 2020,deloudelouvain,9," Leone, Morricone, Van Cleef, Eastwood, a guaranteed winning combination in spaghetti westerns.","There are a lot of movies that I liked when I was young that didn't age well but For A Few Dollars More isn't one of them, it's still a great movie. I loved those spaghetti westerns from Sergio Leone when they came out and I still love them now. For A Few Dollars More is certainly one of the best ones, and even fifty-five years later it still rocks. Sergio Leone knows how to make villains likable, he knows how to make a story suspenseful with not a lot of words. The close-ups from the characters are already enough to bring that tension that we love so much. It has to be said that the cast is very well chosen. Every single one of them looks like a bandit, or just a mean guy you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley. But what to say about the soundtrack? Ennio Morricone is or was (since he passed this year) the master of soundtracks. Who doesn't know those typical spaghetti western soundtracks, we all heared them before and we can all whistle them during the movie. To this day I still think Morricone has the most recognizable soundtracks. This soundtrack was in fact the first I ever bought on cd later on, a masterpiece if you ask me, the perfect sound to add to the suspense during the stand offs in this movie. The stand offs in this western are legendary, like in all other Sergio Leone westerns in fact. The only negative I could write about the sound in this western would be the fistfights that don't sound real, I guess that wasn't their forte in 1965. The acting on the other hand was just mesmerizing. Lee Van Cleef (one of my all time favorites in these kind of movies) and Clint Eastwood did a terrific job with their characters, but also Gian Maria Volontè and the young Klaus Kinski. This movie will forever stay a classic in this genre, after so many years it's still as enjoyable to watch as the first time I watched it. Definitely the movie you have to watch if you like westerns.",

'For A Few Dollars More (1965)' casts Eastwood's nameless stranger - who's introductory sequence is one of the best in cinema history - as a dangerous but reckless bounty killer, pairing him with Lee Van Cleef's methodical and sophisticated Colonel as they aim to take down a well-known criminal and pocket the large reward. Van Cleef has a more personal stake in the action whereas Eastwood's in it for the cash and this juxtaposition wisely adds variety to the already well established formula as their uneasy partnership is never as straightforward as it may seem. Along the way we get the blistering confrontations and cool cigar-chewing banter we'd expect from a picture of this calibre. Those stare-downs are just as good as ever and, while there's nothing here quite as intense as the final showdown from the trilogy's first instalment, the feature as a whole is just a lot more fun. 8/10",

The creations that inspired the directors were significant, but not necessarily superior.

67,10 July 2020,christopher-underwood,9, A thrilling and wonderful looking film,"A thrilling and wonderful looking film with a sumptuous soundtrack and iconic performances. It is, nevertheless, easy to forget how important this film was in so many ways. Following on from A Fistful of Dollars (1964) Sergio Leone decided a follow up was possible and so began his short but sensational directorial career. Clint Eastwood agreed to star once more, thereby cementing his move from TV to cinema and becoming an international star along the way, not mention becoming many a young teen's poster hero. Lee Van Cleef, who had had a successful but largely unnoticed film career, that began with a small part in High Noon (1952) was brought in to co-star. His rise to fame would not be as meteoric as Eastwood's but his mesmerising performance ensured a big enough future with many fine roles. Luigi Pistilli was retained from the first film and his solid performance and good looks would ensure that he too would make many more high profile films, particularly in the world of the giallo but also more such westerns and crime films. Indeed the film world in Italy had already begun to explode with more such Italian style westerns, after the first film, but now the phenomenon was unstoppable and the term spaghetti western was coined to describe the genre that had given that traditional old tired, gentlemanly and sentimental American one such a successful twist into life. Enio Morricone, man of musical magic, had been working in film for some five years but it was this one and recordings of his soundtrack that also shot him to fame and fortune all around the world. A position of such acclaim, of course, that last even to today. Many have written of the film itself and I will restrict myself to commenting on the high quality of cinematography, the determination to make every frame look good and to supplement these attractive images with many a close-up of the characterful individuals, chosen surely at least in part for those very faces. In conclusion I must mention the considerable length for a film with such a fairly simple storyline and say that although there may be a slight slowing towards the last part of the first half when we maybe think the whole film will be following one baddie after another for apprehension, 'dead or alive' we instead encounter Gian Maria Volonte and his men and from there on there is no looking back - that will be the task of the participants, for there will surely be at least one guy with a gun coming up behind, or over the roof, or out of the window. All accompanied by that instantly recognisable music, teasingly introduced bit by bit at first and finally as a suitably crescendo like accompaniment to the stylised mayhem of the macaroni western, as the Japanese would say.",

Sergio Leone's explosive Spaghetti Western debut 'A Fistful of Dollars (1964)' was produced on a shoestring budget, and, though the financial restraints are easily noticeable in the final cut, the film has such a unique visual style that it didn't really matter. For his follow-up, Leone had a considerably-larger budget with which to toil, and the result is a more coherent and assured editing style, the work of consummate professional. However, at the same time, this creative progression has a simultaneous detrimental effect. Leone, in attempting to craft a (slightly) more conventional picture, was now less inclined to indulge in the unashamedly erratic editing  such as instant cuts from vast landscapes to sweat-soaked eyes  that had made his previous film so utterly unique. Nevertheless, great film-making is about finding that ideal balance, and it's reassuring to note that the director did eventually strike it with his next picture, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966).'",

The films get progressively better, with the first a loose remake of something else about a loner wading into a town; beating up the Mexican bandits and then attempting to rescue a damsel, a wonderful film on its own but now more a fascinating example of Leone as he found his directorial feet. Seeing the 'trilogy' as a whole, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a culmination of Leone's sublime ability to work within an established western setting but implement similar plot ideas and a stark, episodic directorial style as he makes every sequence and scene his own as this sordid tale of mostly unpleasant people weaves their way to a bloody, confrontational climax.",

It's an unrelenting barrage of stern-faced masculinity, bravado and marksmanship, with filthy hired hands perfectly willing to trade bullets around every other corner. As with each of the director's dust-soaked pictures, this film covers for its small budget with an excess of personality and buckets of atmosphere, which results in a tougher, bolder, more genuine take than the most expensive Hollywood blockbusters of today. The infamous showdown with a truly despicable set of bounties may be what sends this picture riding off into the sunset, but it's a quieter scene earlier in the story that's always stuck with me: two grizzled old hunters trying to impress one other with nothing more than an empty street, a set of pistols and a pair of bullet-riddled hats.",

And, while it does not reach the unassailable heights of the truly great films that Leone would later make, one can see, in the film, and in its structure, the DNA of greatness that Leone gave this film, and which had been born in him. And with that gift, the man also showed the way to greatness for other practitioners of the genre, and film in general.

There are several nice pieces of machinery seen in the film, not quite as fancy as those in the Sabata trilogy. Yes, there are a handful of obvious low budget shots, but it still holds up well as the middle piece of the trilogy.

He is not driven by demons in his head or something; he has chosen for it. El Indio is the most frightening character I have ever seen in any opera, play or movie. The characters in Ffdm are more interesting - those in GBU are archetypical. So GBU raises some philosophical questions, Ffdm does not. The side characters in Ffdm are more developed: think of Cuccillo (Aldo Sambrell), Wild (Klaus Kinski) and Groggy (Luigi Pistilli). Also Leone makes full use of the triangular relation of El Indio, Cpt Mortimer and Monco, something he does not in GBU. But why should we care? A fist full of dollar clearly was a warming up - For a few dollars more and The good, the bad and the ugly both are extraordinary. Closer to perfection is hardly possible.",
97,5 September 2019,Dello_,9," Worth the ""few dollars less"" spent to watch it","""For a few dollars more"" is one of the great spaghetti western by Sergio Leone. The film is a bit slow for today standards but it doesn't care because it is highly entertaining and satisfying at the end. Indeed the slowest parts of the movie are the Sergio Leone's close-ups on the characters' face expressions, which thanks to an excellent cast create characterization and convey emotional tension. This is particularly true for the gun duels where the eyes of the characters study each other at the point where the viewers can almost feel the soul of the challengers. And in this duels there is a great expedient: the two gunfighters have to shot when the music from a pocket watch stops and this simple element gives freedom to the great Ennio Morricone to shine. The score is indeed fantastic and highly memorable with some few themes that will be impressed in the mind even after the end of the movie. As I said all the cast was exceptional but I have to give a special mention to Lee Van Cleef who portrays the colonel Douglas Mortimer, whose character form an alliance with Monco (Clint Eastwood) to take down El Indio (Gian Maria Volontè), that I felt stole every scene he's in.

That sounds simple enough, but there are twists along the way, as well as a wonderfully gradual reveal of the backstory. Everyone is tough as nails which makes for some badass gun battles, but there are also little moments of levity sprinkled in, none of which felt like filler, and the storytelling is tight over all 132 minutes.

Douglas Mortimer(Lee Van Cleef) are bounty hunters that try to out-wit the other in tracking down and turning in 'dead or alive' the ruthless villain Indio(Gian Maria Volonte).

The super powers of the two major characters here makes no sense. For that matter, neither do their characters. We're supposed to accept their vicious behavior, but why? No explanation.

This movie has a lot of acting without words, lots of watching and waiting, which is typical Sergio Leone Style.

Like ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, Van Cleef's character is a bit like Harmonica's in that he has a personal score to settle with Indio. Also, like ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, Col. Mortimer's motives are shown through piecemeal flashback sequences throughout the movie.

The storyline follows two bounty hunters that seem to be tracking down the same outlaw and his gang. They cross paths and initially try to stay out of each others ways as they figure out each others motives and plans. Their paths eventually have to cross and they decide it is best to play off each others strengths so they can both achieve their mutually desired outcome.

It is so hard to say which film is better, this or the first film. Lee Van Cleef is an absolutely awesome addition to this film but Eastwood was slightly cooler in the first film. The lines, dialogue and delivery in this film are excellent. There's great chemistry between characters in this picture. The shootouts, props and action sequences are awesome as you'd expect from a Leone film. The soundtrack is also remarkable. This is a near perfect picture with great depth and a fun ending.

But in many ways this is a better film. The characterization is richer and there is more of a budget to make the film bigger in scope. Sergio Leone would continue in this direction and his films that followed are much more epic and larger scale. Much of Leone's signature style is seen here with close ups and meticulous attention to details. Lee Van Cleef appears alongside Clint and together have good chemistry as bounty hunters who have a similar target and team up. The villain is the same Italian actor who was the bad guy in the 1st film. In my opinion, he was actually better in this and conveyed a sense of cruelty and madness.. Some might say his performance was too theatrical and over the top, but I thought it was a perfect counterbalance to the American actor's more subdued approach. My favorite of the trilogy is to come, The Good, The Bad And The Ugly.

I suppose thats when you go to the other two.Lee Van Cleef is most memorable as Mortimer, Valonte is more enigmatic than Ramon in a Fistfull and Eastwood has matured somewhat. There are so many memorable lines in the film. The character interplay is truly excellent. Mortimer ever so precise and thoughtful, Indio always calculating and in a rage and Manco always subtle. It is difficult to describe more without spoiling the film and plot. I guess the next best thing to do is to see it for yourself.

140,12 July 2000,monabassil,10, THE ARCHETYPAL SPAGHETTI WESTERN,"Before giving a comment, let me introduce the film to the readers: in 1964, Italian Director Sergio Leone made `A Fistful Of Dollars' starring Clint Eastwood and (the gorgeous!) Gian Maria Volonté. A year later, Leone made `For A Few Dollars More', and, in 1966, his masterpiece `The Good, The Bad and the Ugly'. The 3 films are known as `the so-called Dollars trilogy'.",

The film is packed with gun-blazing action and high-noon tension. The film stars Clint Eastwood as a keen-eyed, quick witted bounty hunter on the bloody trail of Indio (Gian Maria Volonte), the territory`s most treacherous bandit. But his ruthless rival, Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef), is determined to bring Indio in first...dead or alive!",
142,30 October 2005,stl30,10, The cinematography of the wild west,"Why is For a Few Dollars More one of the greatest movies of all time? Passion. This is an exercise in suspense, violence and beauty. From Leone's tic perfect casting to Eastwood's virile hunger to Morricone's iconic score. Everyone and everything here is a purposeful addition to what is inevitably one of THE great films. The interplay between the bounty killers treads that fine line between the light and the heavy heart. That between Mortimer and Indio a simple display of vengeance beautifully layered and represented with the agonisingly tense chimes themselves layered over the harrowing suicide/murder flashbacks. This is how cinema and soundtrack should be done. Perfectly. And the climax, perhaps the greatest in cinema. The showdown. The redemption. The performances. The full realisation of the score. One shot. Sun and blood drenched beauty, an understatement, an overstatement, call it what you will. The effect is undeniable. And has to be seen to be understood.",

Clint Eastwood remains the cigar smoking, man-of-few-words gunslinger that he became known for. Very entertaining.",
144,25 September 2021,theognis-80821,5, Mediocre,"This highly stylized, wildly exaggerated ""western"" is more closely akin to the farces of Laurel & Hardy (note the slow burns and gradually escalating comic violence) to anything we might expect from John Ford or Sam Peckinpah. The fancy visual style is needed to distract from the feeble plotting. After a bazillion hours of TV westerns, including Eastwood in ""Rawhide,"" there may have been nowhere else to go. Still, despite the remarkable innovative score by Ennio Morricone, it's a dull show. Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef do a fine job in their Stan and Ollie moments and Gian Maria Volonte is almost as scary as Walter Long, but all the laughter of the cast does not make up for the lack of laughter in the audience.",

Realizing that El Indio has surrounded himself with so many other bandits, both of them enter into an uneasy alliance with each other. In the meantime, El Indio and his men have decided to rob the Bank of El Paso which raises the stakes for everyone. At any rate, this film is the second of the ""spaghetti westerns"" which followed the highly successful ""A Fistful of Dollars"". And although it isn't a sequel, it has several actors who starred in both films, most notably Clint Eastwood, Gian Maria Volante and Mario Brega (as the bandit, ""Nino""). And like the first movie, these three performed similar roles in a superb manner. But what really distinguishes this film from the previous one is the presence of Lee Van Cleef who, in my opinion, was just as good as Clint Eastwood. In any case, this film is just as good as its predecessor and those who enjoy this style of western are sure to appreciate this one as well.",

You haven't even heard of these places? They are in Texas, New Mexico and Mexico! No problem, everything was filmed in Spain anyway. However, EL INDIO, a crazy and very dangerous bandit, is off to these localities and a $ 10,000 reward has been put on his head. At the end, Clint Eastwood, the only one who is still alive even today, is leaving with all the money. Just to have an idea... Now, we have a very young Klaus Kinski, in a small but great role, maybe his greatest. Then, we have a few long-term collaborators of Mr. Leone, some Italian, some Spanish, but all unique figures, faces you can not easily forget: Mario Brega, Luigi Pistilli, Aldo Sambrell, Benito Stefanelli (also stunt director), Enrique Santiago, Lorenzo Robledo. There is also the old and funny Joseph Egger, Austrian actor who had a similar role in ""A Fistful of Dollars"". Great cinematography by Massimo Dallamano, who worked with Leone also on ""A Fistful of Dollars"". Probably the most beautiful soundtrack ever written for a film, signed by the great Ennio Morricone. They should also be mentioned here: Bruno Nicolai (conductor), Alessandro Alessandroni, musician: whistling and guitar (uncredited), Bruno Battisti D'Amario, musician: guitar (uncredited), Nino Culasso, musician: trumpet (uncredited), Maurizio Graf, singer (uncredited). Last but not least, the 3 main actors, all three great great actors, unfortunately 2 of them, who are not anymore alive, unknown or completely forgotten. Everybody knows Clint Eastwood so, no need to comment on something. Lee Van Cleef was and remains a very special actor, unmistakable due to his face (especially his eagle nose) from many successful action films.

Some of Leone's trademarks, such as the use of a 'good' a 'bad' and an 'ugly' character are shown here for the first time. The surprise here is that this time around Clint Eastwood isn't actually the good one. Lee van Cleef might look sinister in his black clothes, his impressive weapons arsenal and really seems at first like the bad guy, but as the story progresses, we learn that he is, in fact, fighting for good reasons, unlike Clint who is only killing for money.

We can anticipate the same marvelously high quality from all his pictures, in every regard, and the only question is of which aspects are most readily fetching from one title to the next. In varying proportions we're invariably treated to splendid costume design, and hair and makeup work; lush, vivid cinematography; beautiful landscapes, and fantastic set design; rich, timeless music that lends tremendously to each passing scene; pristine effects; outstanding direction; reliably powerful, dexterous acting; and more.

You've got the dusty Western town, the villains, the bounties, and most important the bounty hunters. One thing that absolutely makes For A Few Dollars More stand out is the incredible chemistry and pairing of the stars Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood. The two of them teamed up against each other later in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, but this time they team up together or try.

As with the other Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns, the elements of a great picture are there. The music ,done by Ennio Morricone, is exceptional. The cinematography is gritty and dirty. The plot and character development are the only loose points that could have made this movie truly great. Do no get me wrong, I love this movie. I do not like it as much as The Good, The Bad and the Ugly, A Fistful of Dollars, or Once Upon a Time in the West. The plot revolves around an outlaw named Indio and the 2 bounty hunters (Clint Eastwood's - The Man with No Name and Lee Van Cleef's Col. Mortimer) determined to get him. It is a revenge/greed motivated plot. Gian Maria Volonte plays the role of insane, paranoid and evil Indio to perfection. By far the best aspect of the movie is the soundtrack. The title track and the pocket watch theme are two of Morricone's best. My favorite scene of the movie would have to be the duel at the end. Classic.

The odd thing is that this should be a good film, it has all the necessary components, but it just doesn't work. The pace is far too slow and the film wastes three interesting characters and actors. It's all so focused on posing and setting up scenes that it forgets to include any plot, dialogue, real action, and character development.

Companionship between two bounty hunters is intense and they have different desires in their hunt of Indio.

It is almost certain that Manco and Colonel are going to be the ones that win and get what they want but the way their characters are outsmarting and giving their help to fill bound between them is remarkable.

I'm not going to go into the plot of the movie for I find myself quite annoyed when I read a comment under movies that has everything short of the script written on them. But film fans and film students alike can really benefit from these films, especially For a Few Dollars More since it is arguably the best one.

182,25 January 2023,BananaWizard1,10, Sergio Leone´s underappreciated masterpiece,"If someone mentions the words ""spaghetti western"", for most people, the Dollars trilogy with Clint Eastwood by Sergio Leone will come to mind. ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is widely remembered as being the first spaghetti western to redefine the genre, in addition to kickstarting the carrers of Eastwood, Leone and Morricone. ""Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo"" permanently changed, not only the Europen westerns, but the western genre as a whole with the perfect cast, perfet soundtrack and the instantly recognizeable soundtrack. However, the Dollars trilogy's overlooked film, ""For a few Dollars More"" is , in my opinion, as good as ""The good, the bad and the Ugly"", in addition to being my favorite of the trilogy. As opposed to the previous film, the stoty here is a bit deeper, with a certain mystery that only becomes solved at the last scene. In addition to Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef enters the cast as Colonel Douglas Mortimer, a former soldier-turned bounty hunter. Van Cleef´s acting, especially in the duel, is perfect, because of how he is mad, sad, excited, ready and badass all rolled into one. Gian Maria Volonte, playing a different mexican bad guy than from ""Fistful"", is great as El Indio, if not a bit theatrical (he was a stage actor). And who could forget Josef Egger as the old prophet. The scope has also increased tremendously from ""Fistful"". They visit at least 5 towns, mutliple jails, a train, sallons, and, of course, the beautiful Almeria desert. The soundtrack for this film is also beautiful, and the diuels are all accompanied by fantastic scores. The film is, in my opinion, the funniest spaghetti western (aside from the comedies, of course). The humor is more subtle as opposed to jokes, with countless memorable ones (the hotel owners, the old prophet, the not-so-politically-correct hotel worker, the ""robbery"" at Santa Cruz, the old prophet and many more). This movie pioneered Sergio Leone´s style and takes it´s time with telling the story, something that i appreciate. The dialogue and scrips has definetly improved since ""Fistful"", thanks to Segio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni. There´s countless things i could say about this film, but I think it´s time to wrap it up.",

192,6 February 2022,Philipp_Flersheim,5, Brutal and boring,"'For a Fistful of Dollars' was so innovative that Sergio Leone failed to top it with his next outing to the wild west. Here, two bounty hunters team up (though their alliance remains shaky) to hunt down a gang of bank robbers. There is the expected double crossing not only on their side but also on that of the gang, whose leader (played by Gian Maria Volontè) tries to use the bounty hunters in order to get rid of his colleagues (he does not want to share the booty). 'For a Few Dollars More' does have some of the elements that made 'For a Fistful of Dollars' interesting: the great music and the blurring of the distinction between hero and villain, for example. It also (and that's a downside) gives violence the same kind of esthetic appeal. Van Cleef is menacing but has a soft spot; Clint Eastwood is taciturn - with no soft spot. Volontè is brutal. Klaus Kinsky (one of the robbers) has perfected his trick of looking like a maniac. In short, it is all pretty generic and no longer original. Add to that the constant violence, and the whole film quickly gets repetitive and boring. It beats me why it is being rated so highly.",
193,9 April 2003,shakey_jake53,8, Solid sequel,"Though it's a little longer than it should be and drags at times, it's still a solid action packed western.  Clint is great, this time as a mysterious bounty killer, and the addition of Lee Van Cleef is good as the veteran bounty killer that Clint has to team up with.  There are a few too many unneccesary scene's including the constant flashbacks by the bad guy, but the action scene's were good, it was all well directed, and the score was solid as well.  I give it a 4/5, maybe would've got a higher rating if they had trimmed it a little, but as it is its a solid western.",

Eastwood, Cliff and 'El Indio' are good in their roles and the direction of Leone is superb.

197,28 June 2000,alice liddell,9, One of the great sequels.(possible spoiler),"Holding the centre between the compressed hysteria of   A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and the epic baroque of THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE is a muted, slow-burning puzzle.  Don't get me wrong, it's still full of funny and madness, but there are few explosions of ecstatic violence, the rites here are most definitely those of death, a death which infects the whole land, as visualised in the hilarious, absurd opening scene, a fixed long shot of a lonely rider who is arbitrarily picked off.  Life has no value in these parts.  If FISTFUL was early Verdi, than this is Wagner, an astonishingly free consolidation and elaboration of themes, intricately worked out, a fusion of visual and musical leitmotifs, true music drama.  If Peckinpah is balletic, than this is a suffocating tableau vivant (or mourant?).",
198,13 May 2004,nickdesouza,7, Not as tense nor as clever as Fistful,"Eastwood for me is wooden and surpassed in acting quality of Van Cleef - in fact I think the film would have been better if only one bounty hunter took on El Indio - i.e Eastwood isn't needed. The film is slicker - more money was obviously poured into this production - than Fistful. But in that film Eastwood is clever, the plot and twists are satisfying and the bad guys' characters are well developed but just as nasty. Still, it's a fun film and the gun fights are exciting. I have yet to see The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and cannot wait until I do. If it contains the intelligent plot of Fistful with the beauty and intense nature of Once Upon A Time in the West, then it'll be a winner in my book. If, however, it is solely about gun fights and dilutes the main characters' impact by having too many of them as in A Few Dollars, then I'd likely give it the same mark - 7/10.",

213,23 April 2023,RonellSowes,5, Just Wears You Out,"Sergio Leone, certainly in this film, and in general save The Good the Bad and the Ugly, is at his best with a scene. Meaning, over the course of his excessively drawn out films there's a few flashes of his creativity that work while most of it just grinds you down with tedium. Its certainly a style, and I suppose you can give points for care because there doesn't appear to be a frame that isn't given the utmost intention; Leone treats each one like it's the most important shot in the movie. But theres so many great, precious scenes we're drowning in them. Even if you try and give yourself to it and soak it in I think you will eventually be worn out. Somewhere buried in this film is a more concise, energetic movie that frankly would be more watchable.

There is plenty of gunfighting in this film and nobody can't be entertained by the wild showdowns that two partnered bounty hunters face on their journey to capture a lethal bandit named Indio. Once again, no words can describe how inspiring this film is. Unfortunately, I was only able to watch A Fistful of Dollars once, but now I am free to watch For a Few Dollars More over and over again. Clint Eastwood's portrayal as the Man with No Name proves to be superb and inspiring. A true western classic that no western fan, especially a Clint Eastwood one, should miss. I wouldn't have missed this film for the world and I am looking forward to watching the conclusion of Eastwood and Leone's infamous trilogy; The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, which I know will the most impressive of the three.

One of the reasons for this is the display of talent. Lee Van Cleef and Gian Maria Volontè deliver great performances as Colonel Mortimer and El Indio, respectively. Volontè portrays his character with a level of complexity and expressiveness rarely seen in the Western genre, whilst Van Cleef is given a central part in the film's most memorable and entertaining scenes - the 'match-striking scene', the 'hat-shooting scene', and the inevitable standoff. Clint Eastwood's iconic character is always entertaining to watch, but I think the most meaningful moments in the film come from his reluctant ally (Van Cleef) and his enemy (Volontè). The technical aspects of this film are just as good as those in 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'. Whilst some of the cinematography and of course the soundtrack in the third film are by far the most memorable, Leone's crew managed to create an appropriate visual and musical atmosphere for this darker, more brooding film. To conclude, I believe that this film draws closer to perfection than its more famous follow-up, using better pacing, excellent technical talent and outstanding performances to cement its place in the history of both the Western and cinema.",

Movies are the art of dream-making and visual wonders.
Everyone seems to have thought about robbing the bank, but they have not put it into practice. The movie helped us achieve what we thought. It seems a little difficult to rob the bank in China. Basically, I do n't see many stories of Chinese filming robbing the bank. Is it because the bank is state-owned, it belongs to public property, and robbing the bank is an act of digging the corner of socialism. In a capitalist country, robbing the bank is a legitimate act, because this is part of the class struggle.
On the other hand, no weapons have been regulated since ancient times. China is not a society with a general gun, so there is no such western film, nor soil for the gunman duel, instead it is a martial arts film. The stories of Tianya endlessly emerged, mainly due to the struggle between officials and the people. To be precise, various martial arts characters appeared only when the world was in chaos.
There is also the lack of public power. In human history, it can be said that justice is a substitute for revenge, but justice is also a suppression of revenge. In fact, even revenge is a system to suppress the revenge that is allowed to dominate the emotions. This revenge is too bloody, it will be excessive, and it will definitely infringe on the innocent. Therefore, it will surely trigger a circular revenge, which will lead to a world revenge and prevent all related people There are peaceful expectations. Therefore, the practice of ""returning teeth with teeth and eyes to eyes"", the norm of ""reporting complaints directly"", and the earliest justice when society has surplus products, all of which are no longer to satisfy the desires of the Avengers Rather, it is for the sake of social public interest to punish those who infringe on the rights and interests of others in a controlled manner, in order to suppress people's revenge.",

The three memorable main characters combined with Leone's exuberant style and Morricone's epic soundtrack manage to give new life to what could have been the usual pastiche of western stereotypes. If Eastwood's character in ""A Fistful of Dollars"" still retained some heroic traits while saving the damsel in distress, here he is just an opportunistic bounty killer making his way in an outlaw world.",
246,31 October 2022,VikingBurialService,9, Competing Bounty Hunters,"Just as good as the first movie in the Dollars trilogy. Basically, two bounty hunters compete to capture a wanted criminal as the criminal tries to rob the El Paso Bank. Everything from Morricone's distinct western score, the Leone's mastery of cuts and shots in his camerawork, to the well constructed scenes and setting, drags you into the story by force. The acting feels a little flat sometimes, but it feels like it's almost a part of the western genre, and doesn't take you out of the movie. Eastwood and Van Cleef play off each other as competing bounty hunters brilliantly, with the hat-shooting scene being one of the funniest and most entertaining so far in the whole series. Even the dubbed dialogue doesn't bother me as much with this second movie; it feels like a distinct aspect of the series by now. Overall, it's a completely enjoyable movie on its own, while playing a perfect middle-child in the trilogy.",

That is not to say the film does not have shoot outs as Eastwood and Van Cleef outdraw the bad guys. The film's finale features a highly tense stand off between Van Cleef and the bandit that is played to the chimes of a watch. All in all a very entertaining watch.,

I keep going back and forth on whether or not I like A Few Dollars More or A Fistful Of Dollars better. I think I like A Few Dollars More, A little better due to the addition of Lee Van Cleef as Col. Douglas Mortimer. I found his character the most interesting, and loved any scene he was in. In fact in think the start of A Few Dollars More is better as well, with these two scenes of Col. Douglas Mortimer and Monco collecting these bounties. It really got my interest up and got me invested early on. My only problem I had was that no one told me these were not the same characters as the A Fistful Of Dollars, because when Gian Maria Volonté character came into a scene I was very confused and was like ""I thought he died in the last film!"". But that's really minor, and my brain finally started to work and again and I was able to enjoy the rest of the movie 😅😅",

It serves as an excellent introduction to the main characters and never bogs down into what I consider self-indulgent sequences in the way Leone would do in his later films. Despite the triple openings, the first act setup is simple and clear: Two skilled bounty hunters will be going after the same deadly target, how will this work out? The second act follows the bounty hunters discovering they are after the same prey, reluctantly teaming up, and then follows the cat and mouse trickery to get one over on the villain during an El Paso bank robbery. Unfortunately, everything after the bank robbery and before the finale is the kind of meaningless slog that I find in spades in Leone's bigger epics. In the end, I don't think the final acts of the film live up to the crisp and promising introductions.",

For a Few Dollars More is a triumphant second installment to Sergio Leone's infamous, and by infamous I mean that in a great way, trilogy. This film proves to be just as entertaining as A Fistful of Dollars and yet For a Few Dollars More is a better film. There is plenty of gunfighting in this film and nobody can't be entertained by the wild showdowns that two partnered bounty hunters face on their journey to capture a lethal bandit named Indio. Once again, no words can describe how inspiring this film is. Unfortunately, I was only able to watch A Fistful of Dollars once, but now I am free to watch For a Few Dollars More over and over again. Clint Eastwood's portrayal as the Man with No Name proves to be superb and inspiring. A true western classic that no western fan, especially a Clint Eastwood one, should miss. I wouldn't have missed this film for the world and I am looking forward to watching the conclusion of Eastwood and Leone's infamous trilogy; The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, which I know will the most impressive of the three. Eastwood and Leone haven't let me down and they never will. Perhaps Eastwood's performance in westerns may still prove superb even without the assistance of Italian director Sergio Leone. But the two of them side by side help them film Eastwood's most classic westerns and above all, his most classic films of his career. Bravo, Eastwood. Bravo",

Firstly, as always, the music from Ennio Morricone is beautiful. The action and cinematography are top-notch as always. The character of Col. Mortimer gives the movie more depth than Fistful, and the villain El Indio is top-notch. The final shootout is one of the best in the genre and the final shootout with the chimes makes me shiver.

293,4 August 2018,ikizdevran-882-254684,8, Alive or dead? It's your choice.,"""For a Few Dollars More"" is a highly enjoyable spaghetti western film. Situations and the plot are designed specifically for the fans of this genre. It is the 2nd film of the Dollars trilogy, which is also known as The Man with No Name. The films in the trilogy have nothing to do with each other in the means of story, but after seeing the 2nd film, it starts to make sense to me why they are called a trilogy. Even though the stories are completely unrelated, these films are gathered more or less around a similar plot. Soundtracks are equally beautiful, the leading actor, Clint Eastwood, stars in all three films. Even the names of the first two films are completing each other. ""For a Few Dollars More"" is more serious and complex compared to the first film of the trilogy, A Fistful of Dollars. From the point of view of action and story, I find this one more satisfying. You can feel that, in ""For a Few Dollars More,"" director Sergio Leone has more trust in himself because of the success of the first film. He is more focused and his distinctive directing style is more visible in this one. The leading actors Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef are completing each other. The villain El Indio, played by Gian Maria Volonte, seems to be the evilest character of the Western films I have ever seen. Besides the performances, soundtracks and the western atmosphere are the strongest points of the film. Even though there is well-structured story, you get the feeling that, things are happening based on the situations. It seems like the characters don't follow a plan, but react to incidents. This makes the film more complex and hard to anticipate.",

308,20 October 2015,luis_neiva,9, Who needs opera?,"For a Few Dollars More is the second spaghetti-western directed by Sergio Leone and the middle title of the ""Dollars trilogy"". It's also his second partnership with Clint Eastwood and with Ennio Morricone, one of the most brilliant and prolific soundtrack composers of all time.",
309,24 June 2022,mrstamps,7, Very Advanced Plot,"The plot seems very advanced for its time! But I still think the first movie (A Fistful Of Dollars (1964) was better. Though this movie has a very clear and straight forward though strong plot, the scenes do not reach the expectations, and I died laughing because I was watching it with my dad, and it felt needed to point out how in Indio's flashback/dream, he is just staring at the 2 people through the barrier railing 🤣. The music made it even funnier too. Anyways, good plot, good movie, not as balanced out as the first though.",
310,21 September 2014,parkin05,6," Why choose this ""Spaghetti Western""?","For a Few Dollars More, is part of a trilogy of films by director Sergio Leone starring Clint Eastwood. In this film, ""Monco"" played by Clint Eastwood, and Colonel Douglas Mortimer played by Lee Van Cleef are bounty hunters chasing the same bounties, namely one El Indio (The Indian) played by Gian Maria Volonte.",
311,23 September 2017,wasif-10737,10, Gangster El Indio what a villain (*_*),"Leone's true masterpieces, and quite possibly Leone's most ""watchable"" film. A Fistful of Dollars is a great film: revolutionary, gritty, violent, and fun, and it certainly was the true beginning of a monumental change in westerns. However, this is the first film where Leone's brilliance fully comes to the front. On the other hand, while not quite as famous (in the English-speaking world) as the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (GBU) and perhaps not quite as great a cinematic achievement as GBU or Once Upon a Time in the West (OUTIW), this film is nevertheless not far behind those clear masterpieces. The characteristic Leone visual style and incredible artistry are very powerful here. Although some of this is evident in small amounts in the previous film, here we really get to see the incredible, revolutionary close-ups and the contrast between close- ups and long shots. These and other images are powerful and beautiful. The film also brings the deliberate pacing and wonderful, almost unbearable, build-up of tension before quick action. Leone's sense of irony and brilliant weaving together of various motifs and symbols (particularly religious) also comes to the forefront in this film, as does the humour. Just seeing the quality of the images, the photography, and the cool faces (I can't imagine a western hunter with other type of face), makes this movie excellent. The plot is not very complicated and you can argue some decisions made by the villain, but even with that, I think is very intelligent and probably by that you can't guess what is next. Eastwood, Cliff and 'El Indio' are good in their roles and the direction of Leone is superb. No doubt, Leone can be considered the best western director of all time, not by one movie but for his complete work. This would be the only film from the Dollars Trilogy (between A Fistful of Dollars and The Good, The Bad.& the Ugly) that isn't an Empire 5-star rated film. So, in order to complete the trilogy, I decided to watch this one anyway to satisfy my need for completion to see why it wasn't awarded the prestigious five stars. Compared with A Fistful Of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More is a far more developed film, albeit a completely different story. The stories lead into each other though (although you don't need to watch the first to understand the second), as The Man With No Name continues his bounty work which we are introduced to in the predecessor. As ""Fistful"" did, ""Few Dollars More"" has plenty of throwaway moments and parts that are shallow and uninteresting, but the style is one all of its own and Leone deserves continued celebration for the way his movies rewrote the essentials of the Western formula. Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef are bounty hunters on the trail of El Indio (Gian Maria Volontè). Eastwood is out for the money, but Van Cleef has other motives. Bullets fly, bodies are stacked like cord wood, and the action never stops all to incredible music by Ennio Morricone. The movie far outshines most of American westerns.Lee Van Cleef is great as veteran bounty killer and the same goes to Clint Eastwood. Gian Volante puts up a good performance as the evil Indio. The plot is a little slow but look at ""High Noon"" or any of the other old westerns.An all time great western!! performance of ""El Indio"" in this movie is real high class no doubt.",

313,4 April 2001,redcap-1,8, One of the best westerns ever made.,"It's one of the best westerns ever made. Maybe it's not so exciting to watch it today than it was 36 years ago but it still makes my eyes lock on the screen. There's only one western better than that and it's ""The Unforgiven"".",
314,16 March 2020,Treammolb,8," Not as grand and entertaining as Leone's later works, but carries within a deeper, more touching story","The first in Sergio Leone's so-called 'Dollar' Trilogy (which isn't truly a trilogy, but more three westerns which star some of the same actors, the same music, and carry a similar aesthetic). 'For a few dollars more' hones in on Manco (played by Clint Eastwood), a bounty hunter in pursuit of the somewhat unstable and crazed criminal El Indio (Gian Maria Volonte). Quickly, Manco partners with a different bounty hunter Col. Douglas Mortimer (portrayed by an excellent Lee van Cleef, in a rare outing as a good guy).",
