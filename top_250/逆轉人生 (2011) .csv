Too give the really infamous appreciation of the reader from Toronto to the French public, qualifying us of a segregationist country is difficult to gulp especially coming from north America which has not a very glorious past on the matter even in recent years. Perhaps the commentator should see the movie ""The help"" to refresh his memory... But what I'd like to say here apart of praising the fabulous interpretation of both leading actors is to remind that this is a true story, it did not come out from the directors and scriptwriter heads.",e

Saying it is one of the best is quite a statement. This French movie with sub titles is simply Spectacular. The storyline involves a man crippled in An accident, his wife has passed away and he cannot Find adequate help which he requires 24/7. Until he meets the Most unlikely of people to care for him.

10,17 March 2013,planktonrules,8, Very nice acting.,"According to IMDb, ""The Intouchables"" set all sorts of box office records--the second most successful French film in history in France as well as the number one film for 2012 in Germany. So, because of this very impressive pedigree I was perhaps expecting a little more. Now this is NOT to say it's a bad film--it's wonderful. It just didn't seem quite THAT wonderful. But it IS well worth seeing.",3
11,31 May 2012,Boba_Fett1138,9, This is how a genre movie should be done!,"This movie so easily could had become a forced and melodramatic one but luckily it's one that got made with lots of tact and skill, making this one fine drama, with a comical touch to it as well.",3

13,18 March 2012,yris2002,8, amazing feel-good movie,"It's quite rare to find and have the pleasure to enjoy a genuine movie, blending comedy and drama with such naturalness: that's why ""Intouchables"" is undoubtedly a rare authentic picture and the fact that the story is inspired by a true one helped make the movie more involving. Funny and touching at the same time, the picture evolves with simplicity but strong pathos, with the merit of avoiding every pathetic or melodramatic attitude: there's brutal honesty in representing the real condition of Philippe, as well as Driss's initial uncompassionate attitude. There are touching moments, there are true amusing moments, both accompanied by a forceful soundtrack. Acting proves brilliant, to say the least, and the pairing between Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy sparkles and captures the viewer's attention. I was swept away by Dryss's genuine smile as well as by Philippe's melancholic eyes, and the moments when they are together filled me with an authentic feeling-good sentiment. Definitely, a must-see picture.",9

Photography of images are great, supported by good choice of locations supporting actors are all good and natural so doing a great job to give a great solid base to the story. RIch of emotions on a simple story where ordinary people become extraordinary. Good representation of social differences in France without being too heavy on it. Simple, beautiful, efficient, like a good French cuisine, making a great dish full of tastes magically mixed :) Most to be watched and even more emotional when you know its based on true story !",8
16,5 June 2012,estebangonzalez10,9, Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy shine in this French feel good movie,"¨Sometimes you have to reach into someone else's world to find out what's missing in your own.¨ Intouchables is a remarkable ¨feel good¨ French film mostly about friendship, but there is a little bit of drama and a love story included as well. This film with relatively unknown directors and actors has managed to make some big noise in Europe, and especially in France where it has become the second highest grossing French film of all time. The key to the success of Intouchables relies on the great chemistry and performances from Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy. They are just absolutely great in this film and their friendship felt authentic and real. The movie mixes the drama with the comedy really well and it works better than most films have in the past when combining two different and sometimes opposite characters together. Sy and Cluzet play totally different characters who come from very different backgrounds, and although we've seen this play out in hundreds of films in the past it works really well here thanks to their terrific performance and a great script from the directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano. Cluzet has a sort of a Dustin Huffman vibe and he says so much with his expressions without having to say anything at times, while Sy plays a more outgoing character who isn't afraid to speak his mind. This odd pairing reminded me a lot of another film which I really loved, Goodbye Solo which follows a similar premise at times. Intouchables is a feel good movie, but it transcends the term at times and becomes much more. An absolute must see, especially if you've ever had to work or live with a handicapped person.",7
17,6 September 2022,askeland89,10, The one time I didn't mind reading subtitles,"Still struggling to understand why this masterpiece didn't receive a single Oscar nomination, not even for best foreign film. And Omar Sy should have been nominated for best male actor as he practically stole every scene he was involved in. It felt natural, as if there were no acting involved. If it was made today it would sweep the ceremony, no question. At times it made me laugh uncontrollably, and the humor comes naturally rather than through telling jokes as with most comedies. Although this is not strickly a comedy, it falls more under comedy/drama. It tends to get serious at times. The fact that this is based on a true story makes it even more incredible.",/
18,21 February 2012,schwoni,10, Best movie I've seen in a long time...,"I CANNOT BELIEVE that ""Bridesmaids"" is nominated for an Oscar, just like Brad Pitt for his completely boring and not convincing part in ""Moneyball"", when in 2011 such a great movie was made!!! Did the Academy even see this?",?
19,6 February 2012,mau-zi,9, After this film I have to reconsider my other 10/10 ratings,"This was for sure one of the Top5 or Top10 movies I've ever seen. The actors, the ambiente, the story ... simply everything was in a perfect combination. This film is for me in a league with films like ""The Elephant Man"", but for a much wider audience. And as the title say, after this film I really have to consider to reduce my ratings for several films, because it seems a bit unfair to put them on the same level as this film, although I don't have anything to criticize on them at all. All the persons in the film are very authentic played. And both main characters surprised me with a brilliant performance. I would say, that both actors are really what they are playing in the film. If I would see François Cluzet in the street, I would be surprised not seeing him in a wheelchair. The emotions shown in the last sequence of the film are so brilliant.",r
20,9 August 2014,classicsoncall,8," ""Hope keeps us going.""","I didn't know what to expect with the odd sounding title, and I still don't know if it has any application to what occurs in the picture. However the story is a genuinely inspiring one of two individuals from widely disparate backgrounds who decide to give each other a chance. As the movie unfolds, one's own preconceived notions about having a handicap as severe as Philippe's (Francois Cluzet) are challenged. I found it fascinating when he explained that his real handicap was living without a wife rather than being a quadriplegic. I really had to stop and think about that. Omar Sy provides the film's energy with his indomitable spirit; his birthday party dance to Earth, Wind and Fire's 'Boogie Wonderland' was a trip and did a wonderful job of further breaking down barriers between himself and the upper crust acquaintances of Philippe. Had this not been based on a true story, I would have found it hard to believe coming from some writer's creative imagination. Which only further suggests that sometimes reality is truly stranger and more wonderful than fiction.",e

25,4 January 2022,view_and_review,9, Tweaked a Known Formula,"""The Intouchables"" took a tried and true formula, tweaked it a bit, and made a sensational movie. The idea of ""The Odd Couple"" has been around for ages. We see it most in buddy cop movies, but it also rears its head in other genres. I, for one, have gotten tired of the idea of polar opposites becoming friends. It's not that I don't appreciate or like the idea, it's just that it has been done so often. The very thought of having to watch two people get to know each other and appreciate their differences makes me roll my eyes. ""The Intouchables"" takes the idea, guts it, and gives us a gem.",t

28,21 September 2012,writers_reign,9, A Touch Of The Poet,"Unlike their counterparts in the rest of the world critics in the UK - where it opened today, months after its initial release last year - have been giving this movie a hard time. I would have thought that people who spend their working lives watching one violent film after the other punctuated by mindless horror, teenage pap and worse would find a film like Untouchable a pleasant antidote but that doesn't seem to be the case and the fact that it's all true - we learn in end captions that both men remain close - appears irrelevant. So much for hacks; the International public have already embraced it and it's more than likely the UK will follow. For many non-French audiences Francois Cluzet appeared on their radar first only six or seven years ago when Tell No One was an International hit. Jazz buffs had registered him as far back as 1986 when he co-starred with Dexter Gordon in 'Round Midnight' (coincidentally another 'true' story based on an unlikely friendship between American Jazz pianist Bud Powell and a young French fan). I personally have yet to see him give even a mediocre performance let alone a bad one; as for Omar Sy this is the first time I've heard his name. There are, of course, precedents for unlikely male bondings in fact Francis Weber, the French writer-director, specialized in the genre in such titles as Le Chevre, Les Compreres, Tais-Toi etc, Daniel Auteuil has also joined in at least twice (Mon meilleur ami, Apres Vous) and so on but despite it being well-worn Untouchables applies a new lick of paint to the genre and delivers a feel good title to remember.",r
29,28 April 2012,Sanou_san,10, Just Brilliant,"It's been a while since I wrote a comment for a movie. I rarely find the luxury of time praising a well crafted movie that doesn't give a damn of any social issues. And it's totally rare for me to have the lucky chance finding a foreign movie that doesn't need to tell its masterpiece beauty. First of all, all the time I was watching the movie I thought I was staring at Dustin Hoffman playing well a disabled nobleman being taken care of by a straight-thinking commoner. I know the overreacted dire issues this movie is being pestered, but I don't really care what other people say how the movie should have been. It's an obvious sign already that this movie topped 111 (and may still elevate) in IMDb top 250 movies that a lot of sensible reviewers appreciated its simplicity. The reason indeed probably why the crew casted a black man instead of Arabian to portray the character because maybe simply Omar Sy just had the skill to fit in to the character's delicate vessel. Why so locked with the racism issue? Other may had been suggestive but it's not an extreme case to horribly condemn the movie of its simple choice. I just don't understand people who can't keep their bloody mind open. Well either way the movie had its story straightforwardly rendered and its worth approving rather than condemning. I even laughed so hard when Driss (Omar) just naturally cackled all over the man dressed like a tree singing at the top of his voice, man that was really a humorous punch. The drama Well done.",v
30,31 July 2012,StevePulaski,10," Defines ""wholesomeness"" and then some","Now here is a film that perfect defines the word ""wholesomeness."" The Intouchables is a moving parable about a wise but poor black man who becomes the caregiver and mentor for a wealthy tetraplegic in a series of unlikely but not unbelievable events in modern-day France. The film begins by showing the man's assistant, interviewing candidates for the job of being the man's hands and legs, but as the man sits close behind her, he becomes increasingly unsatisfied with the candidates due to their lack of motivation or their mundane nature.",

The second one - the world where Tris lives, for all society he is criminal, dangerous man, he can't feel himself as a part of it. Two lonely men become the best friends and help each other.

33,9 September 2012,Luigi Di Pilla,10, This movie touched me very much,Another great film from the French film industry that made a great echo all over the globe. All this with a low budget and a story inspired by true events. The tetra person was played very convincing by François Cluzet. Omar Sy delivered a surprising and respectable performance. I find that the Intouchables should deserve at least an Oscar. I laughed a lot about all the funny jokes and adventure scenes. Each one of the sequences had lot of emotions and every detail of the handicapped man was well studied. The running time was not too long for me. I didn't expect such a beautiful happy end.

Forget Fred and Ginger, forget Humphrey and Ingrid, because now it's all about Phillipe and Driss. Most French films I watch are nasty (but brilliant) shockers like Inside and Martyrs. Of course I've seen the odd gentler one like, I've Loved You So Long but even that's depressing. The funniest French films I've seen are Jean-Pierre Jeunet's, Amelie and Micmacs, but Untouchable just about betters both of them. It's not just one of the most funny and touching French films I've seen, but just films in general. Only a seriously bitter and cynical person could hate Untouchable.",

This film is 'Intouchables' and the one of good reasons of its success is that it deals with a problem that seems to be universally actual but especially painful nowadays in Europe and France specifically – the relation between the 'native' Europeans and the immigrants who migrate to the Old Continent in search of its freedom and chances of finding here prosperity and escaping the hardships and in many cases the prosecution at home. This encounter is an encounter of cultures and styles of life, which puts to prove everybody's capability to accept the differences and to live aside or even create stronger relationships despite the differences.",

Everything is deserved. First of all, this is a movie where you will end up laughing maniacally. The film has a lot of humor, some with a nice British edge to them, and everything is so real and cheesy as it would be in real life. And that is the best thing about the humor! I must pay my gratitude to Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet! Both manage to create a realistic and moving friendship on-screen! The thing is that they are two entirely difficult individuals, Philippe (Cluzet) is a wealthy man in a wheelchair, Driss (Sy) is an ordinary, poor guy with a lot of siblings! You follow how a friendship can evolve between these two entirely different persona's, and what their ordinary day would be like, together. Cluzet and Sy gives humanistic and brilliant performances, worthy of an Oscar nom for the both of them! The film is a masterpiece from start to finish, with deep messages, humor and remarkable performances! This movie would be my pic for ""The Best Foreign Language Film"" at the Oscars! Heard that Weinstein bought the rights to the film, with the intention of doing a remake. Dear Hollywood: Don't bother...",
47,24 March 2015,ironhorse_iv,9," This French film, about unlikely friendship, is amour with its viewers! It can't be touch!","While the movie isn't that high in Avant-garde art, it's still hold Avoirdupois with its audience. Inspired by a 2004's documentary film entitled 'A la vie, a la mort', that tells the true story of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his French-Algerian caregiver Abdel Sellou. The movie directed & written by Olivier Nakache & Eric Toledano, tells the story of a young trouble Senegal man from the Paris projects named Driss (Omar Sy). While, he has no ambitions to get a job, he finds himself in a job interview. The reasons why is because for him to continue to receive welfare benefits, he has to apply to, at least, one job and get rejected. Instead of being rejected by the employer; wealthy quadriplegic, Philippe (François Cluzet), hires Driss as a caretaker. The reasons why, is because, Phillippe believes that Driss is the only person, that treat him like a normal person. That, and Phillippe feels that Driss just conning the welfare system that he helps pay for. While, Driss, at first uninterested in the job and his lack of professional experience shows, Driss does well, overtime, caring for Philippe, even if his methods are unconventional. Soon an unlikely friendships grows as both men, help each other with their trouble lives. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the movie is both very charming and moving. It's a feel good movie. Maybe, a little too, feel good. The reasons why, I say this, is because the film, feels like its missing deeper drama that should have been tackle in the film. In my opinion, the movie doesn't really dig too deep into the complexity of their friendship. The socio-economic divisions that separate Philippe and Driss aren't substantively explored, enough. Yes, the movie show the different between both men, in the fields of art, music, and social activities, but it never goes any deeper. Call it, nitpicky, but I really wanted them to tackle, the issues of wealth, race and physical abilities, more. Another fault of the film is how predictable, it is. It's so predictable, that you knew that third act, break-up was going to happen. You know, that they were going to make up and find themselves, as friends, again. There isn't anything really new that makes this film stand out. I saw this premise, in other films before, like 2009's Blind Side, 2009's Soloist, and others. It's basically the French version of the 'White savior' & 'Magic Negro' narrative in one film. Despite, all those little complains, this movie is way higher than any of those films, I listed. This movie offers valuable reminders about how you can't assume anything about anyone regardless of their wealth, race, or physical abilities. The movie is shot, very well. A good example of this was the interview sequence. When the camera pans over the men waiting for the job interview, it goes for their shoes. All highly polished, combined with ironed trousers and then it reaches a pair of worn out shoes, in which Driss is shown in establishing shot. With this simple trick audience knows how much he doesn't fit there. Very clever. The movie pacing is in good hands. I never really got bored, watching it. It doesn't go too long, or too short. The movie is fantastically acted. Both actors were great in their roles. As an American that knows little to no French; I found the French to be easy to listen to. The French dialogue is pretty clever. You don't need to know, much about the country, to get into the film. Also, the French doesn't sound rude, or uber romantic. It doesn't go, too fast that you can get lost. The subtitles are nearly in the same pace and really helps if you do. Despite, the language barrier, the movie is surprisingly a very funny film. I have to say, the whole cop chase, and the cutting of the beard, were the highlights of the film, because how laugh out funny, it was. The movie also have a great choice of music. I love the use of classical music, R&B, and others. It's nice to hear the band, Earth, Wind, and the Fire, again. It's no wonder why France selected the feel-good movie as its 2012 submission to the Academy Awards for best foreign language film, but I was deeply surprise, it didn't make the list. It's weird in a way, since the film was the most acclaimed movie of that year from Europe. The Weinstein Company, which distributed the film in the US was unhappy with the results. They note, the failure, came because, how unfamiliar the film was, to US audience and how people might mistake the film for being racist, due to the concept, of a poor black caretaker taking care of a rich white man. While, some American critics see a modern-day version of a black domestic and his white master, I see it as a movie about friendship. Like many French people, I don't find this movie offensive. I really hope, other Americans don't think so as well. While, the film has begun to receive more American attention with it having a prominent place on Netflix's Foreign Movies list. It's still clear, that more Americans need to see this film. If not, Weinstein Company might end up making an Americanized remake of this film. As of this writing, it's up in the air, if that remake is going to be good or not. I hope it is. If you like this movie, also check out, the memoirs, ""You Changed My Life"" & ""A Second Wind"". Overall: This movie is a witty and sweet. It's must-watch. I do recommended. You will have a lot of fun, watching it.",

50,13 November 2011,RoodBlackmail,10, A moving story that make you laugh & cry - Du rire aux larmes,"When I went to see Intouchables I am expecting to see a good movie because the buzz in France about it right now is pretty unbelievable, to the point that a 10:30am screening was full (10 days after the release), I left the theater happy because I didn't see a good movie but the best movie I have ever seen. I loved Nakache & Toledano previous movies, for me they represent what French cinema does the best these kinds of comedies that always put you on the verge of tears while laughing at jokes that feel so real. With Intouchables they put that characteristic even further; the movie is FULL of jokes and it also treat one of the most serious subject. François Cluzet is at the top of his art, the best (French) actor of his generation for sure. Omar Sy delivers a spot on performance, I particularly enjoyed his melancholic look, you can just see the emotions in his eyes. Their on-screen friendship is probably one of the best I have seen and we can summarize it with these words from the movie ""These guys they have no pity"" a friend of Philippe-talking about Driss- to which Philippe answers ""You know sometimes he hands me the phone because he forgot"". Driss forget that Philippe can't move his legs, his arms, can't feel anything that is under is neck and this is priceless for Philippe. In a world where everybody looks at him like an handicapped, Driss' behavior is more that a fresh air, it's a reason to live for, to think that maybe there are others people like him, that can see further that his wheelchair. The music is also spot on, just enough to make you feel the emotion without being too much. I really hope it's going to win lots of Césars. It's really going to be a tie this year for the best actor performance between Omar Sy, François Cluzet and Jean Dujardin (The Artist). ",

In the mind of its creators it seems to be a comic drama of immense human significance; in reality it is powerful and affecting and funny at different times. It's also clichéd, patronising and predictable. ",

Written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano the film was inspired by the true story of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his caregiver Abdel Sellou, discovered by the directors in 'A la vie, à la mort', a documentary film. Of note, the book version of the film's story was written and released after the film enjoyed great success. Written by Abdel Sellou the book 'You Saved My Life' tells the extraordinary true story of the charming Algerian con-man' friendship with a disabled French aristocrat. Sellou's book shows the real man behind Sellou/Driss's smiling face. The book takes us from his childhood spent stealing candy from the local grocery store, to his career as a pickpocket and scam artist, to his unexpected employment as a companion for a quadriplegic. Sellou has never before divulged the details of his past. In many interviews and documentaries, he has evaded or shrugged off the question of his childhood and his stay in prison, until now. He tells his story with a stunning amount of talent, with humor, style, and--though he denies that he has any--humility. Abdel Sellou now lives in Algeria with his wife and three children, where he runs a chicken farm. He remains close to Philippe Pozzo di Borgo, who lives in Morocco with his second wife and two children.",

Anyone paralyzed in this manner deserves sympathy, but if you have a vast fortune, an army of caretakers, and every imaginable comfort and resource you may need less sympathy than some others. Why did the filmmakers transform a North African (Muslim?) caretaker into a Senegalese? Why is this black African's conformity to every cliché -- pot-smoking, violent, rap music, he even dances well -- supposed to be refreshing, either to Philippe or the viewer? So much was simply artificial -- dressing Philippe like a doll, playing with his beard and hair, the caricature of the other applicants, the behavior of the adopted daughter -- or further clichés -- e.g. the police. Mildly amusing at times, way too long, just watchable.",

78,5 June 2012,Niejan,10, A brilliant portrayal!,"The Intouchables (2011) is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. There are no action heroes or good-looking women necessary to make this film perfect. It's all about the story and the development of its characters. Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy did a great job there. Their performances were memorable and well fitted. The story as in the real life story has been portrayed, in my opinion, brilliantly. Of course we can expect a lot of things to have been added to the entertaining production, but nevertheless a lot morally correct life lessons are included as well. This movie makes you search for humanity within yourself as it illustrates how a guy from the low, social classes in Paris can be a true friend and ally of this rich, handicapped person. Subsequently, the writers and producers have creatively played with this and have 'covered' the seriousness of the movie to seconds while the major events have been coated in a fun and inspiring way. The movie is enjoyable for all ages and backgrounds. So I strongly recommend all of you to watch this movie - try to enjoy the jokes, but also take note of the messages conveyed by the movie. Totally worth every second! 10/10",

In spite of several teases and jokes related to disability, they are included in a logical and realistic way into Driss 's character (splendidly played by Omar Sy). No wonder that the film has received so much warm welcome and has become one of the biggest French successes all over the world. Opposites, even antipodes have several things in common, but there are a few occasions triggering the events to understand them. ",

105,12 August 2012,axb,5, Hollywood film made in French,"This french film starts with a Dustin Hoffman look-alike actor being driven by a black driver (Omar Sy) who is fond of Earth, Wind and Fire music and has a swagger made popular by many a black Hollywood actors including Eddie Murphy. In the typical Hollywood fashion he comes from the wrong side of tracks (think of Murphy in Trading Places), but ends up living in a Paris mansion (again echoes of Trading Places) taking care of a quadriplegic (François Cluzet). Somehow he learns to take care of his patient and in fact becomes quite an accomplished male nurse. The transition is mildly amusing, and won't bother you if you checked your skepticism at the door before entering the movie theater. If you have any doubts about whether or not this film is in the genre called Hollywood fantasy, you have to see what our tough man with heart of gold does next. He decides to teach his boss how to be a good father and ultimately becomes cupid for his boss. The film plays on the obvious disparities between expectations and attitudes of the privileged and under classes in ways that are funny. If you wish to enjoy this film, please keep your expectations low and ignore the obvious visual and other tricks. One of the early scenes shows a row of shoes and socks of the candidates waiting to be interviewed for the nurse's job. As the camera pans, all candidates are wearing shiny shoes with clean socks, but one pair stand out for being dirty and incongruous. Of course, they belong to Omar Sy's character and he gets the job at this super-rich household. How fuuunny!! I predict that in two to three years there will be a Hollywood clone of this film with Dustin Hoffman and Chris Rock playing the main characters. And it will be a box office hit.",

The aide is some guy from 'the hood' who gets the job because he shows no pity for the condition of the paralyzed man. From the premise up we get treated to a repetition of the same joke with the paraplegic at the center. I can't remember the last time I saw such an array of unfunny clichés posing as a film. Omar Sy does well as the French version of Will Smith and other actors perform on par. The film's impact just relies too much on the obvious humor excavated from situations involving a man who due to an accident can only move his head. Would perhaps have been funny as an episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Quite a trial to sit through.,

So it is only the healthy, which can free themselves in part of the fear of a severe disability - and much more important: of the guilt of being healthy and consequently also of the responsibility to deal with the disabled and with prophylaxis. The right thing would be to finally allow and promote stem cell research on a broad scale, so that such diseases can be HEALED - because ONLY THEN can severely handicapped people really lead a happy, normal life again, not if people simply provide a funny nurse for them - which is like a band-aid for a severed head, nonsensical AND it prevents that the real problems are tackled/the real solutions can be addressed !!",

It's the case of a movie with the kindest, inherently liberal message there is: a man from the projects lucks into a job (via Earth, Wind & Fire and Kool and the Gang as his 'references' at a brief interview), and it's taking care of a very rich man who is a quadriplegic. Over the course of this story they'll grow and become best friends and while the rich white guy can learn to relax a little more, smoke some weed (no, really) and listen to that Kool & the Gang, the dude from the projects gets some Vivaldi, makes an abstract painting that sells for 11 grand, and goes paragliding.",

The cool dude shows the stuck up old man how to have fun and in return the rich guy teaches him about arts, manners and whatnot. Initially they have a few quarrels that mostly derives from the social, racial and age difference (and that the man is actually paralyzed from the neck down) but in the end they grow close and live happily ever after.""

138,23 February 2021,judemcrobbie,10, Heartwarming and Funny,"The opening scene is so funny. The suspense created from the arrogance Driss (Omar Sy) gets you truly fearful but then they change it up from impending doom to a punchline.
Omar Sy has this infectious like-ability that not only rubs off on the people around him, but you the viewer as well. He deserved an Oscar nomination for this. He also has this incredible ability to show one character but with so many different sides to him. He has this almost a parental side of raising his younger siblings and then the fun Driss that is shown through the movie.
The whole way through the movie it preaches the 'see the man, not the chair' so well that by the end of the movie you completely forget the wheelchair, which is the first thing we get led towards at the start of the movie.
One of the funniest movies ever made as well. This is quite a brave call to make a comedy on such a touchy subject. They manage to do it both tastefully and hilariously at the same time.
This might just be one of, if not, my favourite comedy of all time. It's both heart wrenching and heartwarming at the same time, terribly and balls to the wall bold as well.
The score is magical and just captivating. It's pretty much all piano, reflecting the class and Phillipe's (Francois Cluzet) music choice, except the on-screen songs making a down to earth feel. Compare these to the on screen songs, which are pretty much all Driss' choice, which are stark contrasts to the off screen (This shows how Driss is an injection of fun in Phillipe's life, almost in a Romeo and Juliet or lady and the tramp feel) shows the imbalance in everyone's lives.
Francois Cluzet did not quite stand out like Sy but nonetheless he did a great job in his role. Managing to portray emotion and everything through just the head must. Be incredibly difficult and he does this up to 11.

As for The Intouchables, I really liked the film and found it entertaining and thoughtful at the same time .The chemistry between the two leads is wonderful. Not quite as insufferably retro as it sounds, the formulaic film gets a boost from the endearing performances of its leads — particularly Sy, whose ex-con-turned-servant instructs his cultured boss on the pleasures of '70s soul classics and pot-smoking before cleaning up nicely.

One of the highest rated French films currently, Untouchable is the true story of a rich handicapped man employing the assistance of a benefit scrounging man where the two make for an unlikely friendship. Whilst this does follow the ever so popular formula of ""poor man temporarily lives in rich lifestyle that now changes him for the better"", it is somewhat different in which simultaneously the millionaire is also touched by the lifestyle of the ex-con caretaker. It is this balance of these glimpses into each lifestyle that makes these characters relatable and likeable. They are down to earth, they are just like you or me and I really admire that approach. It's a story of opportunities. Being able to give someone a job that they may not usually receive that, not only brings them plenty of money, but changes their way of life. Their way of thinking. A story like this is the definition of a crowd pleaser. I can say, with certain, that everyone will enjoy this. What assists with my certainty, is the outstanding performances by Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet. Sy was phenomenal. A very grounded and understated performance and you can see he is having fun which really elevates the optimistic mood that the film conveys. Cluzet's performance is rooted with honesty and a hint of sarcasm that makes the dialogue refreshing. There were many moments where I laughed which again is a rare accomplishment in itself. It's does try to tug on your emotional strings a little too much and personally I don't think it achieved this. It does enhance the character development but you can see that it does not quite reach those heights. Didn't feel like a natural progression in the story, like the writers just had to throw some emotional conflict for the sake of it. Formulaic? Yes, but this is one of the most uplifting comedies I've seen in a long time. Definitely recommended.",

Driss (Omar) is just perfection and couldn't have been played by anyone else. His personality shine through and you just want to keep watching him. Once the film is over, you feel like you want to know what happens next, where did they go, what did they become? The closing credits do offer a bit of information but you want to keep watching, regardless. Without giving too much away, the ending makes the film complete. I felt like my heart was going to burst - when I realised what happened. And just how good it makes you feel. If anyone enjoyed this film as much as me, for the same reasons I did (that you can actually feel good about watching a man who can move nothing at all from the neck down), then read ""Me Before You"" by JoJo Moyes.

173,2 March 2013,faterson,6," Cheerful, Snappy Movie Marred by Glitzy Milieu","This has to be one of the least-demanding movies on the viewer -- aside from sexual allusions, a 6-year-old would likely be able to understand what the movie is all about. The two lead actors (especially Omar Sy) give nice performances, but nothing really surprising is happening in the course of the movie, and it is only moderately funny. The finest thing about the movie is its ending: despite being entirely predictable, it manages to be genuinely moving. The second-best thing about the movie is its visual splendor: not just Paris in all its (aristocratic) glory, but the countryside, the mountains and woodlands (and spectacularly paragliding over them), the sea and the beach. There is something worrisome and kitschy about the plot, however: it stars an immensely wealthy quadriplegic. I admit I'm not really interested in watching movies about quadriplegics, including those who are not well-to-do, but for the entire duration of the movie, I couldn't get that question out of my mind: ""Why make a movie about a quadriplegic, but make him immensely rich as well? Why not make a *poor* quadriplegic, or a quadriplegic of ordinary means, the star of the movie? Would there be anyone to take care of *him*?"" In this sense, one might detect a measure of cruelty about the movie -- in that in portraying the life of a quadriplegic, it picked one who definitely will not represent the typical quadriplegics from around the world. The movie's ""love angle"" can, for the same reason, be perceived as cynical, too: would a perfectly attractive and young-looking woman be taking an interest in a middle-aged quadriplegic, meeting him for a romantic rendezvous at the seaside, had he not been as rich as he is? One of the movie's ironies is that the character played by Omar Sy actually says this out loud (and *really* loud) when the two friends are sitting in the opera house: that women aren't looking for charming, handsome men as much as for those men who are wealthy and able to provide security for them. Well, that certainly lends a sour aftertaste to the love story -- but perhaps this was intended by the story's authors, and they are poking fun at themselves in this way. All in all, an OK movie, but insanely overpraised.",

It's a crowd pleaser in the true sense of the word; a movie that works to appeal to every sector of the audience, and uses a familiar formula that's been seen many times before. Interestingly, though, it doesn't resort to the lowest common denominator. Nakache and Toledano were clearly aware of the fact that they're not offering any new revelations, and instead focused on making the movie as entertaining, touching and effective as possible, and it works, loath as I am to admit it. The movie is fast-paced, fantastically edited, always entertaining, sitting squarely on the border between comedy and drama; the two leads, François Cluzet and Omar Sy, have perfect chemistry and make even the crudest jokes work.

I always think that the worst feeling to have for someone is pity what ever the situation is. The scene most magical scene is at the party of Philippe's birthday - that music by the orchestra was not to dance-to everyone thought that if the music is danceble is going to make Philippe uncomfortable but when Driss decides to dance everyone just started to dance with him and Philippe really was happy despite that he couldn't.

190,25 June 2012,Elder_Yautija,6," They found each other by chance, and by chance they decided to... you know... like that other movie!","There's nothing wrong with the meaning of the story. Nothing wrong in wanting to write and direct a well-meant story with some positive messages in it, as opposed to the gritty, dark and negative themes explored by most film-makers, nowadays. I just think it's such an old fashioned topic, there's so many more movies that explore the same kind of relationship, and better movies at that too, that this one comes across as clichéd, predictable and extremely cheesy. A movie like this would have worked for me when I was 10, not now. In the year 2012 it looks like an outdated commercial for tolerance, which, yes, is a delicate subject, but I just don't need such a childish approach to it so that I can understand it. I knew all about it already. And the film-maker should have known that. Infantilizing the characters to make them more enjoyable wasn't, in my opinion, a move that did the film any good at all, as it detracted from the sheer emotional power that it could have had, had the leads been less clownish. In this light, this movie shares the same fault as another french-spoken movie, ""L'Hutieme Jour"" (The Eighth Day), which also deals with the same kind of subjects (acceptance, tolerance, mutual respect, etc... between people of different backgrounds and different chances), and which also ultimately fails to be 100% convincing because of the goofiness of some scenes, which are put there only for the sake of lighthearted fun.",

I read the basic story line and believed the movie would deliver an experience worth its time. I only knew Omar Sy (Driss) from director Jean Pierre Juneauts' ""Micmacs"" where his knack was a proliferation of clichés that trailed off topic, but ended in that contagious smile and accompanying laugh. Not much to work with.... Not so here. From the opening scene, we know the unconventional inertia of Driss, as childlike stating the elephant in the room and his street smarts, but without Francois Cluzets' portrayal of Phillipe the paraplegic, we would have an immature caretaker with a drooling invalid with no heart or purpose. We couldn't be laughing at our own self imposed limitations. Yes, without Phillipe being rich beyond belief, we'd have no action. Much like the brilliant ""The Diving Bell and The Butterfly"", this story takes us away from our spoiled selves, not just cinematically but spiritually. Here it is filled with its own Hollywood clichés of dance scene, car chase and feel goodness, but that doesn't distract from the plot as much as it could have in a s""sell out"" studio requirement.

It is a really charming film, but charm doesn't make a film. It's one of those films built on unconventional friendship and culture clash (also a true story and people it's based on appear in the end credits, similar to 127 Hours), but the difference is that the quadriplegic, Philippe, and the caretaker, Driss, have minimal conflict and bond right away as soon as they adjust to each other. Rather than disapprove or be irritated by Driss interfering or being a nuisance during things Philippe likes, he immediately finds it amusing and refreshing. It's nice to see, but it hinders growth of character, which instead they reach effortlessly by sharing the experience of music, hookers, drugs and paragliding. It is quite entertaining and sometimes moving, but there's not really a story or strong narrative here besides two people improving each others lives through a few light situations.",

You can really tell a lot of effort was put into this project. I have nothing but words of praise for this movie. And those critic reviews about this movie being racist are completely false. So maybe this movie shows that a black guy smokes pot and lives in a poor family- but why is that racist? Maybe it is a cliché that a black guy is poor. But remember, it's based on a true story.

250,20 October 2014,FilmCriticLalitRao,6," By directing ""Intouchables"", directors Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache have made a popular ""feel good"" movie.","The concept of popular cinema has undergone considerable change in France. In the past, it was a device used by film journalists to define films made by directors namely Gérard Oury, Georges Lautner, Claude Zidi etc. In recent times, one sees a new breed of directors especially Dany Boon, Michel Munz, Thomas Gilou etc whose films have had tremendous commercial success. The team of Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache is a new entrant to this group. Their film ""The Intouchables"" can be classified as a 'feel good' film with elements of 'popular cinema'. It sacrifices its elements of realism to portray an imperfect world of ""the haves"" and the ""haves not"" through the depiction of how black people are somewhat forced to live in suburbs whereas their friends live in expensive areas of Paris. As a character study of people from different areas, it shows why only a handful of black people are able to mingle with white people.

In such movies, one often sees the impact that the poor person has on rich person's life, but seldom do the filmmakers try to tell the story from the poor person's point of view. The focus is the rich man and his boring life and how it can be turned around by a poor person who sees it in a different light. Towards the end of the movie, the poor person gets little or nothing out of the exchange, but the rich guy walks away with deep insights and a newfound will to live. It's really unfair how such films portray poor people (recurring trope of them being awestruck by bathrooms) and paint them as incapable of doing anything unless aided by the money from the rich person. I think that's because the target audience is rich people who will pay to watch a movie which gives them some hope.",

The protagonist is wheelchair bound, a quadriplegic or worse, as a result of a hang-gliding accident, which might have been predicted because he risked gliding in bad weather. His wife is almost certainly dead of an unnamed illness (I did not quite understand that part) but that is doubly calamitous since she was the most wonderful woman ever to have lived.

As we meet him he is interviewing for a caretaker/companion and the successful candidate is a Senegalese man who has jumped the line in order get his unemployment form signed so he can leave.

It is a film based on real facts that occurred from the relationship between a rich French aristocrat and his trusted servant, an Algerian who lived in the suburbs. Here, however, the African origin of the servant is reinforced by the intentional choice of a black actor, Omar Sy, while the other role was given to veteran François Cluzet. Both actors were capable of exceptional chemistry and look fantastic when they split the screen. Sy's jokes, in his character, are laughing to tears. The cinematography and the scenery are very good and the soundtrack, Ludovico Einaudi's responsibility, is simply a masterpiece of ""contemporary"" classical music.

It was no fluke it became the second highest grossing box office French film of all time, and Sy receiving the César Award for Best Actor for his role.

I watched the trailer of THE INTOUCHABLES (its Mexican title is AMIGOS, which means ""FRIENDS"") once and it seemed all right, but really nothing that attracted me enough to rush to the cinema. Then I realized it was part of IMDb's always-controversial top 250 – I knew I had to check it out as soon as possible, for mere movie geek curiosity. ",

The actors play a splendid role to depict the life of the real paralysed man and real carer.I only watched this last night and i watched the original - in french. It is a very recent film filmed in Paris and i find this film suits any watcher for the reason that it contains both high-up, posh lifestyles compared to ""chavs"" smoking and speeding Maserati's.

He comes from poverty and walks into luxury: but he's not overwhelmed by it, no tugging the forelock and being intimidated for Driss. He never wavers from being himself. He is unpredictable as he explores the rich world he has walked in to. He might break something, or steal something, or assault someone. If he thinks something is rubbish he says so.

It's a remarkable direction to go with because it so easily and gently presents the strong bond of the pair in just a few minutes. We later come back to this scene and it slips into the narrative quite comfortably. The important thing about their on-screen relationship is that it doesn't lean on the handicap which defines the difference between them. You get a genuine sense of connection and attachment with only a few lines and that's before the wheelchair or the disability is revealed. Such is the chemistry and performance of the pair that they shine in every single scene of the film. ",

315,19 June 2013,the_coolest_girl_in_town,2," This movie is a problem, let me tell you why.","I'm not saying that every movie has to be a political melting pot or a petri dish for ideological views and discussions, but ""The Inouchables"" had a great potential. It missed it's promising but most of all IMPORTANT role to be one of those movies. We have Philippe (François Cluzet), the white, older, sophisticated man with this ridiculously large (inherited) wealth, who's hurt from previous bumps in the road of life. Nothing wrong with a rich, wounded, and above all crippled man. We all have our problems. And we have Driss (Omar Sy), the black ghetto man-boy who didn't really want the job as Philippe's assistant in the first place, but just wanted to enjoy himself being out of jail. The stereotypical pot-smoking negro from the slums, without a care for the civilized society, the arts or manners. So the uncivilized black man teaches the sad old man how to live, all with a cheeky smile on his little face. They get high, he almost beats up the neighbor, he laughs at the paintings in the art gallery and how expensive they are, he consistently hits on a woman clearly not interested, and hires some happy, happy prostitutes. Nothing wrong at all. Before you get though the first half of the film, you have been given examples of the three pillars of french culture; prostitution, colonialism and insane wealth. As a movie, it's half decent. Good actors, some cliché but witty lines, and that's about it. The story is flat, the directing is nothing to admire, but the real problem is it's political blindness. The Omar's character is from the beginning a strong contrast to the order and dignity of Philippe's life, but in such a savage way it's borderline racist. I have three major issues I'd like to bring up. ""Work? I din't know you had humour"" is an example of the negative stereotype this movie projects upon Driss, as a lazy welfare tic. He enjoys weed and hookers, his family is harsh and riddled with kids and bastards, and all the people in the suburb he's from are never seen without a joint. It's simply a bit too racist. But of course, he eventually changes a bit and becomes like, well almost a (white) human being! Problem number two. Never have I seen such contrast in two character's background and wealth, never have I seen such a clash in classes, and never have I seen the issue of class diversity being so vastly ignored as in this movie. Never once is the question of injustice borough up. How can one man have so much money, estate and freedom simply by being born, and how can one man have so little that he, and his obnoxious twelve-or-so-year old brother, turned to criminal activities? To give the story some depth, they tried to arrange a complex scenario where Driss have to save his brother from going wrong, but they handled it clumsily, and without actual dialog. It's like it doesn't even matter that poverty roars around Driss, it's fine and dandy now as he's in his private suite and walks around being tactless in the high society. Here, smoke another joint, make a painting and sell it, but don't use the money it to help your starving family. It's a couple of too many loose ends not being tied to his roots, and the REAL problem; that society and social diversity has formed working class suburbs mostly populated by minimum-wage immigrants. Problem number three is the rotten view on women throughout these 110 insufferable minutes . First of all, it doesn't pass the Bechdel test more than it has two or three named female character. There are many examples to show the complete lack of respect for women, eg how Driss consists of hitting on a woman clearly not interested in him, using disgusting and cheesy pick up lines. Womens looks are very centered, the daughter is portrayed as a spoiled bitch (although her behaviour does not differentiate so much from Driss'), all other women are portrayed only as caretakers, and most deranged of all, the two protagonists use prostitutes excessively. When you watch this movie, have common sense and the right perspective. Don't get fooled by the immoderate hype around this movie, don't get charmed by the fact that it's ""based on a true story"", in fact you should realize that makes it even more insufferable to watch. I had to fight the urge to stop watching all the way through, fighting the urge to scream at Driss and Philippe that they need to take some academic courses in sociology, social economics, gender studies, colonization history and intersectionalism. Usually, I don't demand such political fairness in the movies I watch, but this here is a perfect example of how the racism, sexism and upper class mentality can survive in the 21st century. We don't need this movie. The Swedish title for this movie can be roughly translated to "" An unexpected friendship"", and I find it to be a lie. Hugely expected and predictable, this movie blows life to outdated values and dusty clichés o tell a story. Think about it for another round, and make something better while I try to reassemble my now shattered respect for french movies and culture.",

This is the best movie I have seen in years and it made me laugh, it made me sad, it made simply a better person I can say. I will say I was little skeptic at the beginning because I usually watch American/English movies mostly and I usually don't like non-English movies, I found them almost every time boring and I lose interest very soon, but this one kept me watching without a brake. Its just a WONDERFUL story about friendship and courage of two men that came from totally different backgrounds, but they fit together in this movie PERFECTLY. I gotta say Omar Sy performance was Oscar worthy, he was just great, he made me laugh through the whole movie and he was incredible, and François Cluzet, what can I say about him, he was just great, playing such hard role, I think no one would have done better job then him. Two of them together carried the whole movie and made it PERFECT. The story was based on true events and I believe that fact made the movie even better because it has one thing that most other movies don't have and that is REALITY. When I think about this movie and these two guys and I realize somewhere in the world they exist it makes so happy I just want to be a better person, better friend, better man... ",

This beautiful movie is one of those things that give you the feelings how good your life was. Take my word, this is one of the rare movies with heart in its right place. Last time I felt such a beautiful feeling was after watching Green Book. You are right. The Avengers do not move me, the DC does not allure me . To me a good movie is just like 'the only trace of our passage on earth' just what Phillipe had said in the movie about arts. The movie was so poignant yet so much filled with joy just like the way it tells about the disabled- they do not need your pity, they need your company. The fact that it is based on a true story makes you feel even more positive about the people around, about the hues of life, shades of grief.

375,26 December 2013,annuskavdpol,8, A movie filled with real feeling,"This movie was the best I have seen in 2013. It was so good because it was real, versus fake. Within the field of psychiatry (the act of giving medications to a seriously mentally ill individual) there is usually little room for psychotic behaviour / symptoms. For example in the film the care-giver takes a certain number of risks, that to me borders on psychotic behavior, namely, driving down highways at high speed zigzagging in and out of cars at high speed, experimenting on his patient and stealing. All of these symptoms could also be experienced as criminal through the lens of a police officer - but this movie was more then it's details. It was a movie about a connection, pure and simple. These two grown men connected with each other one way or another. It was real bond that they formed, and this bond was unconditional. No matter what the other one would do, it would be forgiven. The filmmaker could bring to the screen, a feeling that is deep and pure. That is what makes his film so special.",

Most people are lost in different types of circles, and the people in the circles have a common framework. There are many more rules in life that need to be paid attention to all the time, and breaking the rules requires great courage and even pays some price.
Since we ourselves do not have the courage and ability to break through these circles, we try to let the ""catfish"" enter our circles and try to do different things ourselves.

Unlike so many difficult-to-watch and hard-to-love dramas dealing the subject of physical disability, 'Untouchable' handles the subject with a belligerent acceptance that is far more relatable than the worthy wringing of hands that seems to be the standard technique. The direction of the film's writers Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano is assured, with hardly a missed step, and they explore many interesting and novel ways to cast light on the protagonist Cluzet's difficult situation. Sy is a revelation, a fireball of energy and charm, and both are impossible not to root for straight from the gripping opening sequence.

Needless to say things around the stuffy, staid household will never be the same again. I'm not a huge fan of feel good movies but I was totally absorbed in this picture. From the opening sequence with Driss speeding down the highway, weaving in and out of traffic, I got swept up in the film's enthusiasm and energy.

There are moments so intense and so impassioned, though of course not obvious, that will make you feel indebted to this film, with their subtle portrayal in a manner which cannot always necessarily be perceived by the senses otherwise. It will take time for you to understand the parallel facets that follow every measure being pursued by the actors. The background music is almost heavenly took me somewhere so unknown.

I had seen half of this one before and now I had enough time to watch Intouchables until end. In my opinion the story tells about two people from different worlds. Philippe is wealthy paralytic man who lives in a huge house in Paris. Driss is poor ex-prisoner from suburb. Philippe is bored with frequent variation of his caregivers and Driss reluctantly starts as Philippe's caregiver. Surprisingly they make friends. Other characters are in small roles though these have their own important place.,

Not every note makes it to the top but The Intouchables(the name is quite deep) do.The movie in its entirety shows a sublime harmony of an honest relationship, between an accidental handicapped gentleman and a street smart, blunt smoker black guy.There is not much to describe the plot, it's more about feeling it. Nothing that we have not seen but still the life interactions shown here is a rare phenomenon in our everyday busy life. The movie does not make use of the beautiful Parisian landscape outside of the closed doors, but rather stays inside to explore the warm fuzzy feeling in a marriage between a quadriplegic and caregiver.

I wonder what would be said if the black character was cast as Arabic, which was the actual situation on which the story is based. And wouldn't it be peculiar to see an Arab participating in some of the antics that Mr. Sy, the wonderful actor from Senegal performs.

We all have the instinct and dignity.To live, it is important to have both and if the former is too strong, we are laughed by others but latter is too strong we can't feel happy as human.In the story they learn to have them from each other. Now a days the technology enable us to communicate a lot of people and it also has the risk to regard the people as information.

It's a wonderful heartwarming story of two people from polar opposite walks of life who form the strongest of bonds living in each other's pockets and it is also at times hilarious and I have not laughed so much for as long as I can remember.

There are some scenes which have no dialog, only back music. In those scene, characters facial expression tells us a lot of things. And, I think the music in this movie is wonderful.

The first scene captivates the audience in a way unlike any other, by showing the unlikely, and genuine, relationship between two people who would appear to be, upon first glance, polar opposites. I have read through a handful of negative reviews and it, quite frankly, really bothers me. Not only did I find the movie to be laugh-out-loud funny, but it was also very sentimental, especially more towards the latter portion of the film. This is one of only a few movies that I have ever watched that has had my utmost attention for the entire duration of the film. Not once did I find my mind wandering off, and I most certainly was never bored. However, on a more serious note, I think that the movie also shows how, sometimes, the most unexpected people could become some of the most important people in your life.

Despite the complexity of film concept,point of director was undeniably unveiled in such a brilliant way that deserves respect from the spectator's side.
In the onset, Driss is driving Philippe's Maserati Quattroporte at high speed. They are chased through the streets by the police and eventually cornered. Driss claims the quadriplegic Philippe must be urgently driven to the emergency room; Philippe pretends to have a seizure and the fooled police officers escort them to the hospital.Finally, this story gave a raise to interaction of invalid and poorly-resourced man,who may seem as a gratuititious couple splendidly completing each other.
In my opinion, this screening ashows significance of support worldwide and may encourage watchers not to twist in the wind but to weather this storm. Such a brilliant generation would have existed nowadays if kind-hearted people, like these actors, had given an onset in the past.

Philippe doesn't think the other candidates are good, and he sets his eyes on Driss. He comes to work as a helper of Philippe, and starts to live together. Helping him every day is not an easy task.

And so one of them accidentally gets an interview, and the second, as an experiment or as a result of interest, hires to see how it will be and what will come of it. And it turns out quite a serious and friendly relationship between different classes and different cultures, which can unite not only the disease, but also the desire for life, freedom and love.. The most important thing is that the film is based on real events, of course it has been changed and the characters have been reworked, but the fact remains.

Flawless script, unique way of incorporating beginning / towards the end scene. Brilliant actors, great music which sometimes intensified the scenes from behind and in some parts it was cruicial to the actors and, hence, played a partner to leading actors. In 2017 American version was created but I do not have a heart to watch that version. I have already done so with Girl with dragon tattoo and I do not have to repeat that experience. On the other hand, I never say never and there is a possibility, that in a time of weakness I might actually watch American version just for studying purposes. The story has that gradation, moment of surprise and that development of characters I always hope for. In one sentence : It is a bromance, where the leading characters safe one another. Unforgetable scenes like: shaving, birthday celebration, seducing co-worker, Omar´s dancing and mainly his laughter at a theatre.

Philip and Dries have different views on literally everything: art, cars, love. And it is very interesting to listen to their arguments in their favor. In this film, we saw an example of a real conflict, this is not a game of who will shout over whom, as in ""Let them talk"", this is an exchange of their opinions and arguments. We saw a film that really fights racism, not by imposing any thoughts on us, but simply by its existence.",

Though laughter is universal it's often the subtext of good comedy that makes it great, and with the separating factors of a foreign language and subtitles the subtext is sometimes lost. On top of this, the pure cultural differences may even mean that definition of humour is different. Luckily Intouchables is one movie that transcends these potential barriers and provides an experience that is not only touching and engaging, but also very funny. The performances of the two leads are engaging and genuine and the jovial script always serves to lighten the potentially heavy mood of the characters' respective plights. Intouchables is a mirror for its soundtrack, haunting strings mixed with uptempo soul and pop.",

602,4 August 2015,jazzybugz,10, Insensitively sensitive! A beautiful film indeed.,"It's a rarity to see a comedy on disability, to see humor in tragedy. And this film teaches the viewers more than that: to have hope, to be free of your inhibitions (physical, mental, economic). I can appreciate that more since it is very rare in Indian cinema, we love being tragic and our films excel in creating pity for people who are suffering. Oh, but this film.... it touches you deeply and that too without bringing tears in our eyes, but a wide smile on your face. And it's not just about helping an invalid to carry on with life, it is much deeper. Both of the central characters see each other as one, where Driss sees Philippe as a rich invalid but doesn't treat him as one; he has no pity for Philippe, which is exactly something a person fed up of being an invalid needs. Philippe knows that Driss is an invalid too, socially and economically, but he doesn't lecture him on virtues. Both of them try to push each other in doing something they will never do by themselves. And that's the beauty of it, no hand-holding, no tears shed and yet one of the most human films of our time.",

608,23 January 2019,boyofthunder,8, A film for everyone,"Based on a true story, The Intouchables (Untouchable in English) depicts an unlikely, albeit sweet, friendship between an ex-convict (Driss) and a quadriplegic, wealthy man (Phillipe) whose life was rejuvenated upon meeting and appointing the former as his caretaker. A grounded yet unique experience emphasized by outstanding cinematography is what can be savored after watching this lighthearted feature film.
Two men, coming from contrasting parts of society, accompanied each other, partaking a variety of activities around charming Paris and beyond. The Intouchables could be consider rather straightforward with the main characters eventually found their happiness if not for one small detail that was masterfully executed during its length. Appearing multiple times throughout the film in different forms was the word 'Pragmatic'. Most activities carried out by Driss and Phillipe can be considered practical (apart from some, especially the paragliding scene which bears similarities with the skydiving scene in a similar themed film - The Bucket List) and in reality, would not have changed Phillipe's monotonous life, but perhaps it was Driss, a man from an ever struggling part of society, whose actions and the 'pragmatic' ways he handled these daily activities, that had transformed Phillipe from a sanctimonious, highly educated, self-centered man into a carefree yet thoughtful person.
The film, to some, gives a lesson about having a multidimensional view and finding where one belongs to in life through the many adventures of Driss and Phillipe, who together, became the Untouchables.",

613,3 March 2020,wujun-41909,9, Hands of reality touch the heart,"There is no emotional ups and downs of great sorrow and joy in (can't touch). There is no big exciting scene except the ending of two sections of racing. However, the seemingly simple plot leaves a lot of room for rumination. Meredith said in (on the concept of drama and the use of comedy spirit) that the important test standard of a country's civilization is to observe the development of its comedy. From this point of view, the slow creation of a warm narrative and lively humorous language in the film also reflects the height of French civilization to some extent.
In fact, the story of the film is about a pair of abnormal master-slave relationship. From the perspective of literary creation, the narrative structure of (master servant) relationship has always occupied a place in Chinese and foreign comedies. Servants are often indispensable figures reflecting the spirit of comedy, and their wisdom and living ability are often higher than those of the upper class, just like the red lady in the story of the west chamber. In this movie, according to the normal thinking, the servant serving Philip should be as respectful as the other interviewers, but Philip saw the servant's disrespect for himself in this kind of inequality constructed by identity difference, just like the helpless heartache when Derris left and his successor casually said (he took the wrong medicine). Therefore, it was quite to his liking that Derris was careless, because he did not have the rules of others. In his eyes, Philip was not a rich patient, but a friend who could eat, drink and play together. Therefore, he would be unbridled to joke, ridicule Philip's arm, and find prostitutes to comfort his ears.
However, how can two people with different cultural backgrounds produce such friendship? Perhaps, this fate stems from the curiosity of the upper class Philip to the heterogeneous culture. His initial interest in dries is a kind of reckless and strong culture he represents. Therefore, with the help of two people who also need to be changed, the creator refers to two cultures that need to break the gap and communicate with each other. Although the film gives two kinds of cultural exchanges with good results, as Bakhtin said, it is difficult to analyze the truly comic (funny) things, because the negative factors and the positive factors are inseparable in comedy, and it is difficult to draw a clear line between them. From time to time, the film still satirizes the hypocrisy and hypocrisy of the upper class by virtue of dries' humor. In his eyes, those seemingly elegant operas, paintings and symphonies are like a pool of nosebleed sprinkled on the drawing paper.",

622,6 June 2013,anavic_carrillo,10, the adventure of friendship,"The French movie, the intouchables, is a comedy about a disabled aristocrat named Phillip and his encounter with Driss, who is a young man who comes from the outsides of Paris and is fresh out of jail. Phillipe decides to hire Driss as his helper even though Driss does not have any education or experience. Together, they go on an adventure that will make them find the value of friendship even though they are totally different characters, they learn to live and see life from a different perspective and at the same time complement each other perfectly. The directors of this marvelous story are: Eric Toledano, who is forty to years old and Oliver Nakache who is 40 years old. Both of them, who have known each other since the beginning of the 1990's, were born in France and did their first their first short film in 1995. The directors were inspired to do this movie in 2003, after watching a documentary about the life of Phillippe Pozzo di Brogo. Eight years later, they decided to adapt this story and create the movie named ""The Intouchables"" I will now analyze several cinematic aspects of the movie and whether they succeed or fail in these within the movie. The title of the movie is suitable and adapts perfectly to the movie because thee friends are inseparable even though they are absolutely different. When they meet, they find happiness and become comfortable with themselves. Hey complement each other because Phillip does not like a person that have pity on him, which makes them the perfect duo due to the fact that Driss treats him like any other person. Phillipe, after a long time of not doing so, laughs and smiles thanks to Driss's personality. On the other hand, Driss finds another way to live; he learns to be honorable and to work hard, to earn things for himself without stealing others' objects. When they are together, they are unstoppable, intouchable. At the same time that the title adapts to the movie, the cast is totally adequate. Omar Sy interprets Driss, a tall and big man who is funny and always smiling. This creates contrast with Francois Cluzet, who interprets Phillipe as a serious and elegant man. The clothing is another success of the cast from the movie. These reveal the different characterizations of each character. When the movie starts, Driss's clothing are scarce and in bad state but as the movie goes one, his appears to have more clothes and also more sense of fashion thanks to his new job and new lifestyle. Phillipe's clothing is elegant all throughout the movie due to the fact that people that know him expect to see him dressed that way because of his social status. He also dresses according to his age and gender. Phillipe's maids have an elegant uniform to work with, and his daughter has a tendency to dressing inappropriately for her age. Driss's family dress with dark, loose and old clothes, which reflects the type of life they have thanks to the society they live in. The script is simple, clear and adequate. Each character has its own way to talk and express themselves according to their characterization. For example: Driss has a more informal way to talk than Phillipe. Music is not a central point or focus of the movie, but when there is music, it is wonderful and helps create the perfect environment for the movie. When Driss and Phillipe are paragliding, the music is harmonious but moving at the same time, it gives a sense of happiness and adventure, which is the exact situation they are going through. Another moment in which the movie is important is in Phillipe's birthday party. The band is professional and present famous songs that make the audience feel identified with the movie. It makes us remember why music is so important in peoples' lives. The sound was low and high according to the situation the character where experiencing. On Phillipe's birthday, the music is loud, as if it were the one talking, instead of the characters. On the other hand, when Driss is leaving Phillipe's house, it is low and what is loud is actually the rain. The scenography, along with the photography is excellent. It is different in each place including Paris, houses of different characters, mountains, etc. The different environments are perfectly portrayed. The photography is simple. The framing is usually from the hips to the top of the actor or the whole actor. One can rarely see the characters and their whole surroundings, which creates emphasis on the characters and the situation they are in. The movie achieves teaching us, through infortune and humor, that everyone is different and we need to help one another because not everyone has the same privileges or problems. Also, that we need to enjoy life to the fullest because you only live once. We have to be happy with what he have and not with what we do not have. I recommend this movie to everyone out there. It is entertaining for people of all ages and genres. It maintains everyone entertained and interested every second and at the same it teaches a great lesson to the public.

I'm usually not one to watch these type of films, i usually prefer action films however the humour this film gave along with the strong story-line was presented very well, making me laugh and smile through-out the whole of the movie. I would really recommend this film to many different audiences, especially to those who wouldn't usually watch this type of film because It is so unique and gripping.

The cast acting is great, the script - despite it's not a movie where actually a looot of different stuff doesn't happen - has no ""blank spots"" so you just can't get bored and the characters - specially the main ones - are really THAT interesting. The relationship between them is just so casual - despite the circumstances - that it's just fun as hell as well as heart touching.

Its subtle humor and honesty are refreshing amid overly-cheesy movies, This is because it's actually based on a true story. Two men find friendship when everything in their respective cultures says otherwise. It showcases the vast socioeconomic differences between Driss and Philippe and how these barriers are overcome. When we think of Paris and France in general, we do not think of the slums outside the major cities, the poverty, and brokenness housed just outside the ""city of love."" This movie runs the gamut of emotions. The moments of tenderness and truth speckled between scenes of laughter and, sometimes tears.

The very high score of ""Intouchable"" is truly deserved ! The plot is based on the true happened story of  Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and Abdel Yasmin Sellou. In the film, the story is about Philippe, a rich quadriplegic man who tries to find a carer to help him in his daily life. He meets Driss, an black unemployed immigrant. Driss has no competence to take care of Philippe but nevertheless he accepts the job. While the context is very serious (immigrants, unemployment, handicap,...) the atmosphere is decontracted. Driss's tactless manners procures us a very good moment. You can't stop watching and you can't stop laughing ! Even if you've seen it a lot of times ! The main actors Omar Sy and François Cluzet plays their role perfectly ! You get attached on the characters and on the story ! I will not reveal too much but if you haven't seen it yet (and I doubt there are many) then I warmly recommend it to all of you !",

Omar Sy leads to the driving scene, where happens a beautiful part of the movie, a part which is accompanied by Ludovico Einaudi's track.

But there is always at least one person that needs our help, no matter how much we think there's not. That one person can change us and make us better. And we can do that same thing to that person just by being there for them and helping them live their lives. Just by making someone else happy, that can make us happy too.

The Intouchables, based on true story, is a classic comedy blended with high- octane drama and brave performances. The introductory scene is itself is so impressive that you get engrossed in the film right from the beginning. Hats off to the director to develop the each character effectively which blemishes with film scenario. The script is so tight that you would not feel bore for even a single second in the film. Couple of scenes are hilarious in the movie. The scene where Driss dances to his own tune on Philippe birthday party , the scene where Driss warns Bastein to stay away from Philippe's daughter are just like icing on the cake. Even the emotional scenes have shot so well coupled with beautiful background score. Coming to the performances , I was totally floored by Omar Sy's gallant performance. He makes the film alive the moment he steps in the scene. His care-free , straight from the heart , funny-loving character will stay with you even after leaving the theater for sometime. François Cluzet puts in powerhouse performance as Philippe. It takes guts to sit on chair through the entire film and still act well with just the expressions. Brilliant !!!",

The monied cripple, Phillippe (François Cluzet), whose condition is the result of Icarus-style paragliding, veers toward allegory; his stately demeanor, ear for classical music, and Versailles-like château suggest a crusty ""stuck""-ness that his disability only serves to underscore. (And once again, representation of the handicapped in film goes only as far as the metaphors their ailments can equip.) The African, Driss (Omar Sy), is by contrast crude and lovably lecherous-a sensualist-as well as a drug user and possibly former dealer who lives with several younger cousins on the road to gangland.

No one can say exactly what exactly served as the box office success of an ordinary European film, which is far from such an Americanized concept as a 'blockbuster', nevertheless, this dark horse of the box office deserves at least respect, because it is very difficult even for Hollywood majors to raise such money around the world without attracting stars of the first magnitude and the lack of a powerful advertising campaign. '1+1' works in the genre of dramatic comedy, showing the story of friendship of people from different social strata. In short, a paralyzed French businessman (Francois Cluzet) by chance, he offers a job as a nurse to an inveterate parasite and just a former prisoner (Omar Si) in order to diversify his life a little, and at the same time pull a morally degraded person out of the social pit.

Philip and Dries have different views on literally everything: art, cars, love. And it is very interesting to listen to their arguments in their favor. In this film, we saw an example of a real conflict, this is not a game of who will shout over whom, as in 'Let them talk', this is an exchange of their opinions and arguments.

I've watched other foreign films and I can't say I am too pleased. However this film combines classic comedy that all generations will enjoy along with the feel good part of a drama we all long for. The film is based on a true story which makes it all the better. This film truly is a gem. It's a diamond in the rough. Often looked over and passed by this film is a movie not to miss. Do yourself a favor and engage yourself into this film. You will not be disappointed. It truly is one of the best films I've seen in a long, long time.",

763,26 October 2015,zvaal,9, Drama movie with some funny points!,"Intouchables is a great and sensitive film! Its referred to a quadriplegic rich person and how sad his life was. Suddenly he is hiring a young full of energy person to be his caregiver and bring him back to an enjoyable full of action life! Our main character his name is Phillipe and his assistant name is Driss. Driss will give to Philippe a hope and a positive energy,hope to love again, to start again some activities and why not some flirting. The movie can teach you a lot of things and makes you a better person! Great directing, great shots,powerful actors and amazing sense of humour! You will laugh, maybe cry and for sure appreciate how lucky you are....",

765,3 January 2016,giorgos_gr,10, Awesome,"This is an awesome movie. The plot and the idea is very good and touching. The cast, the jokes and the dialogs between the actors are brilliant. Omar Sy does one of his best acting here and you will really enjoy and admire his talent. The movie's subject is sad, as it presents us the social differences and the difficulties that handicapped people face. On the other hand, it has a lot of funny moments which make the movie very enjoyable, and all those life lessons that can teach us worth a lot. It is based upon a true story, so it makes it even more touching. I recommend that everyone should watch this movie, as it is one of the best movies for its genre.",
766,3 September 2015,wanjajordan,9, Go watch this movie!,"First of: What i liked about the movie was the ""lack"" of clichés in this movie because usually movies with ""challenged people"" contain a lot of them. This was quite refreshingly real (not free of all of those happy- clappy-heartbreak-things, but still). I actually went twice to the cinema to watch this one. No need to explain all the details, its deep, its fun, its somewhat new (from what I know). Sadly I don't speak french that fluently to completely understand all of it but if you can, watch it in original tone. From what I heard (comparing french and German that is) it adds a lot more to the ""connection"" between the casts. This is the case in almost every movie of course but I have been told that here it is even more different. Wont say much about the movie, there are more and better reviewers out there to do that. All I have to say: I Loved it :)",
767,30 August 2019,avmesaritis,10, The emotion in Phillipe's face in the end describes the film,An amazing film which encompasses the equal treatment of a tetraplegic man from a young man who is from a lower social status whose simpleness proves to be the ultimate medicine for Philipe.,
768,14 March 2018,sajanthenmahalingam,10, Really nice film best i've seen in along time,"Great story, great cast and had such a nice overall flow to it. Really enjoyed it",
769,12 July 2016,mihai-78553,9, Excellent,"A life lesson. By the fact that it is after a real case movie makes you think if money buy happiness or not !! Of course they bring, but sometimes is not enough. Here comes Driss, which gives us all a life lesson and to never forget that to live, to do what we like and enjoy life and the moment. In other words, live in the present, not the past or future. A movie extraordinary. Also the music is sublime. Recommend this film of Seen together with loved ones and others. Recommend this film.

772,14 November 2019,princeshaan,10, A far beyond excellent,This movie is beyond excellent as this explains what a brotherhood or friendship means. The two character has never hugged each other or never spilled a sentimental words to each other but still they hold the best friendship even if both belong to different worlds. In case if ppl have doubts about humanity can watch this movie and restore the faith.,
773,5 November 2015,AjrTeixeira,8, great film,"I must confess, when my teacher brought this movie for us to watch on our class, I was a little receptive, mainly because I don't usually like French films (mostly because I don't speak French, or even understand it). As it turned out, I loved this movie. It was heart warming to see a young guy take such interest and care on an older person, spending quality time with him, both enjoying themselves with their friendship. However, it was really sad to watch Philippe die. After seeing so much happy times, I was not expecting that at all, since the character was portrayed as a really nice and generous person, so in my opinion it wasn't fair. In conclusion, I highly recommend you to watch it, you won't regret it!",
