0,21 October 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10," A great piece of cinema, a magnificent example of storytelling","I've heard so much told about Citizen Kane and Orson Welles, so I finally decided to get the film, and find out if it really is all that it's cracked up to be... I must say, it's great. The plot is great, and the way it's told is amazing. The story is first summed up in a matter of minutes, about 15, to be more accurate, and then the rest of the film has characters telling the story through flashbacks and retelling. We hear just about every opinion about Charles Foster Kane, apart from his own. The story is told after his death, and we see everything important that leads up to it, and only in the very end do we understand him, only then do we fully understand who he was, and what made him so. The ending also reveals one of the very most important things in any man or woman... one thing that everyone needs and knows of. I won't reveal it here, as it would almost be a crime to spoil the experience of this film to anyone. The acting is excellent; Welles himself is stellar as Kane, and his impressive appearance, along with his commanding voice, makes the character a forceful sight, nay, experience. The characters are well-written and credible. The character of Kane is probably the most well-rounded and perfectly built up I've seen in a movie, ever. The cinematography is excellent... the editing is great. I can't praise the angles, pans, zooms and transitions enough... it just has to be experienced. Now, for the one thing I can criticize in the film; the pacing. It's only two hours long, but it feels like much, much more. There were portions of the film where it felt like it didn't move at all. When there weren't great dialog or something equally as good in the film, it dragged terribly. There were too many scenes where the dialog seemed pointless, as well, I think. It didn't seem to be leading to anything. However, this criticism is so minor, due to the ending more than making up for it, that I still give this film a perfect score. I can't do anything but agree with its placing at the top of the top #250 films of all time, here on IMDb. As I'm writing this, it's #11. That's pretty much what it deserves, in my opinion. Not higher, not lower. Not the greatest film of all time(that pretty much still belongs to The Godfather, I think... at least, I haven't seen a better film than that, yet), but definitely far up there. I recommend this to any fan of film in general, and anyone who thinks they can understand it; it has a truly profound point that any man(and woman) should know of(preferably through seeing the film for themselves). Don't let the fact that it's old and black & white deter you from seeing this masterpiece. A true cinematic masterpiece, in every sense of the word. 10/10",/
1,12 November 2011,The-Sarkologist,9, Is a childhood worth sacrificing for wealth,"I think the quote that my friend made about this movie sums it up pretty much: it is a modern day work of literature. I agree with him precisely on that point. I do not give it a 10 because at places it is slow and dull, but one does not appreciate the brilliance that is this movie until after one has sat down and thought about it. Citizen Kane is not a movie is simply watch, it is one to think about and mull over the ideas that come through it. Another friend stated that it was the most boring piece of crap that he has ever seen, and though that might be his opinion, I feel that he missed the entire point of this movie.",r
2,6 December 2020,Cineanalyst,10, The Citizen Kane of Movies,"The most frequently acclaimed ""greatest film ever,"" idiosyncratic in its day yet massively influential, a cultural staple, a narrative and technical tour de force, and there's the whole thing of the wunderkind granted carte blanche for his debut to the machinery of classical Hollywood at its peak--the expectations for ""Citizen Kane,"" to say the least, are high. Indeed, it's a marvel of cinematography and plot. In both senses, there's a deep focus from various angles. The plot is a jigsaw puzzle of flashbacks from multiple sources--the ""News on the March"" film-within-the-film, the dead man's memoir, a reporter interviewing characters for the meaning of ""Rosebud""--linked by an also-layered sound design and framed by a curious camera violating the ""No Trespassing"" sign in entering and exiting the Xanadu estate. Moreover, the story is about a powerful storyteller notoriously based on William Randolph Hearst (and other famous rich guys, if not also a bit of Orson Welles)--a newspaper man, populist politician, overseer of his lover's career, and who even dictates the story beyond his grave with his final word. The picture constantly exploits a deep depth of field, with figures in the foreground and background in focus, to show it off. Much of this was accomplished by composite photographic effects. While ""Kane"" is famous as an arty old black-and-white film, which it is, it belies that it was genre-mixing popular entertainment and a special-effects extravaganza of its day: the virtuosity of the editing and sound design in addition to the matte paintings, miniatures, multiple-exposure photography, rear projection, and the most significant use of the optical printer in between ""King Kong"" (1933) and ""Star Wars"" (1977). The difference is that the effects here are realistic as opposed to fantastic.",e

4,5 May 2008,WriterDave,8, All That Ballyhoo!,"On the Criterion Collection DVD of Orson Welles' classic ""Citizen Kane"" there is an original theatrical trailer where Welles cleverly advertises the film by introducing us to the cast including the chorus girls, whom he refers to as some nice ballyhoo. That pretty much sums up my opinion of the often over analyzed film that always shows up at the top of the list of greatest films ever made. Even though this was the first time I sat down to watch the film as a whole, I knew everything about it from studying it in film class and from the countless number of essays, homages, and parodies that have come down the pike over the years. It seems impossible now to judge the film against a blank slate, but with great ballyhoo comes great scrutiny.",i
5,31 October 2015,ilpohirvonen,10," Why Is ""Citizen Kane"" the Best Film of All Times?","Anyone who sees ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) for the first time today does so because he or she has heard that it is the greatest film ever made. One simply doesn't come across the film by accident on TV, watching it ""for what it is,"" so to speak. The common approach of seeing it to believe it can be at best exhilarating and at worst hostile. Unfortunately, the latter is usually, although quite understandably, the case. For how can one do anything but look down at a film that elitist snobs have praised for years and years? One simply must prove oneself right by falsifying the critics' claims, leaving the theater or the living room with a shrug and a condescending comment: ""it was okay."" This will not do. It is a great tragedy if ""Citizen Kane"" suffers from these kinds of incidents since it ought to be treated with the same kind of respect as Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" or Beethoven's ""9th Symphony"". In order to make this happen, or perhaps enhance someone's viewing experience, I would like to try and explain not why ""Citizen Kane"" necessarily is the best film, but rather why people have considered it to be. There are over a thousand reviews of the film on this site, and mine will probably drown in the vast sea with them, but hey what can I lose, and who doesn't love talking about Welles and ""Citizen Kane""?",e
6,27 September 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," While it is an example of a film I admire rather than adore, I can see why this film is seen as a classic","That is not to say I didn't love it, this film is absolutely brilliant in every respect. I just more admire it rather than adore it, but I completely understand its reputation as a classic. The cinematography is enough to earn the film's reputation, every shot, every angle is exemplary and has so much visual drama, and you never know from looking at Citizen Kane that it was made on a shoestring budget. That is not all though. Bernard Hermann's score is superb, the story while not easy to understand at first is interesting and the screenplay is thought-provoking. Not only does Orson Welles direct impeccably, he turns in a magnificent performance as Charles Foster Kane, while the supporting acting is excellent too. People may dismiss Citizen Kane as boring and dull, and I have known people outside of IMDb to say that, but I have yet to hear any of those people to say it is not well-made or directed. As for me, I loved this film very much, and while my praise doesn't completely go beyond sheer admiration I cannot deny it is a great film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",w
7,1 August 2016,eagandersongil,10," It may not even be the best in history, but it sure is the most revolutionary.","Citizen Kane is a film with epic characteristics, and was at least 30 years ahead of his time, let's start by spectacular Gregg Toland photography, which for me is one of the top 5 best film photography, all the camera angles, metaphors, editing, close-ups, the use of natural and artificial light, mounts scenarios are something inexplicable (Remember Kane's speech), J. Mankiewicz script is great, using flashbacks (something new in time) and the timeline in your favor, I really can not say if this film was the first film to use these narrative resources, I think not, but it sure was one of the first to use a magnificent way, the soundtrack it is accurate, and the performances are very good, especially the Orson Welles doing a magnificent job, as director and actor, worth a reference scenes ""Post credit"" which explains that all the actors are new, cool also speak the name the cinematographer Gregg Toland is credited alongside Orson, Citizen Kane marked the history of cinema as we know it, so you go to see the movie today will notice that most of the ""things"" are very common nowadays and did not understand why the film is so prestigious, but remember that citizen kane invented this pile of ""things.""",/
8,29 June 2008,Lechuguilla,6, Wonderful Cinematography,"If ever there was a film that I had a love-hate relationship with, ""Citizen Kane"" is surely it. Some of the non-script elements are as good as what one would find in any other film. Yet, the story of Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), an early twentieth century newspaper tycoon is terribly dated and painfully boring.",r
9,15 April 2001,caspian1978,10, A must film for any film maker,There's something worth stealing from Citizen Kane if you're a film maker. What else can you say about this film except for it being the greatest gift one can give to the film industry. Having it have been a box office bomb when it opened in LA in the 1940's only adds to the films greatness. Citizen Kane was before its time and still remains today a movie marvel. There is not a single film school in the World that will not show this film at least twice to its students. A perfect film to watch and discuss for the entire class period. Citizen Kane has more examples of modern movie making than any other film made before or after.,w
10,9 February 2007,jem132,10, A textbook I would have liked to study in school...,"Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE (1941)was perhaps the first American film since the silent era to fully demonstrate the possibilities of the film medium, and the role of the camera. Welles' camera is mobile, no longer the static device used to merely show faces, and Toland's deep-focus cinematography revolutionary. Welles tinkers with traditional filmic narrative conventions to craft a work that is now often termed a 'textbook' of the cinema.",1
11,24 April 2009,murtaza_mma,10, Citizen Welles,"Citizen Kane is probably the best that American Cinema has ever offered, nigh perfect from the start till the end. Often competing with The Godfather, to be numero uno, Citizen Kane is in a league of its own and nonpareil on countless number of fronts.

16,9 July 2012,Red-Barracuda,9, A true original,"RKO was the smallest of the Big Five Hollywood studios and the purveyor of mainly undistinguished genre pictures. For this reason they hired a young theatre producer called Orson Welles to make a prestige film. Welles had just shook up radio with his production of The War of the Worlds, a broadcast that was so innovative and realistic it caused widespread panic throughout the United States with some people really believing that Martians were attacking. Welles was given free reign to make the film he wanted. This was unprecedented for an untried film-maker. The film's central character resembled newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. The film was delayed several months while RKO tried to appease Hearst's lawyers. It was well received by the critics but not a popular success. It would remain the high point of Welles career and the one time he enjoyed such complete control. This led in part to the auteur theory where masterpieces of cinema were attributed to the director's genius. However, this is too simplistic as Welles had great collaborators here such as screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz and cinematographer Gregg Toland. The former provided a disciplined structure for Welles to work off and the latter the deep focus photography that allowed him to manipulate cinematic space in a way that strengthened the story. The combination of deep focus and long takes allowed for scenes where characters moved around the cinematic space in ways that heightened the drama considerably.",0

18,8 June 2016,Vartiainen,7, Giant of its field,"Any art becomes harder to appreciate as time passes. We look at statues and paintings from, lets say the Ancient Greece, and we appreciate them for their aesthetic, their style and the craftsmanship that went into making them. Yet we often know very little about why or even how they were made. Were they political in their time, like art often is nowadays, or were they made simply to feed the artist, like some of the greatest works of art in history have sometimes been made? And if we somehow found out that a painting of a human figure in some prehistoric cave was actually a political satire of the rival clan chief, would it add value to the work?",?

The frame of the window ... well if you watch the different shots that lead up to the house, you will notice it too, I won't have to point it out. And as controlled and rehearsed that was, as much is the rest of the movie. Especially when it comes to framing, but also lighting. The movie made use of many different techniques to keep the cost down, but still look epic - and it succeeded, thanks to the complete control Orson Welles had over it.",r

But even if you are well aware of the significance of the word, this classic drama is still a must-see if only because of its status as one of the most important and critically acclaimed films ever made.",e
21,31 August 2006,elleglw,10, why did Citizen Kane create such an impact upon its first release?,"Well as a media student myself , i have come across this question many times in books and during lectures. There are simply 3 reasons the film, which was considered as the ""Mona Lisa of all films"" , created such a legendary appeal upon release in 1941: 1) This was Orson Welles first cinematic debut , even though he had been a huge star in theater , he was given an opportunity few first time directors were permitted to having. He had full artistic freedom and above all power, to direct , produce, write and even star in his own picture. Therefore the film industry and RKO pictures had absolutely no influence in the making of the film and were not to know what was happening on set .Of course this was bound to generate a number of problems as businessmen were curious about the nature and plot of the film , which takes us to the second reason the film caused controversy.",f
22,8 June 2015,anaconda-40658,10, One of the Greats!,"Citizen Kane (1941): Dir: Orson Welles / Cast: Orson Welles, Joseph Cotton, Everett Sloane, Dorothy Comingore, Agnes Moorehead: Portrait of a wasted life full of luxury opening with Charles Foster Kane who whispers the word ""Rosebud."" With that he dies releasing an ornament that crashes to the floor such as his life. During his life he had alienated himself from everyone, focusing on a political career. Those who knew him are interviewed examining the meaning of his final words. Speculations evaporate into flashbacks to show his brief childhood to his introduction into the world of politics. Directed by Orson Welles who was only twenty-five when he directed this film, and its impact would render it his masterpiece. He also takes to acting and flawlessly portrays Kane through his adult life and mirrors his frustration and longing for the one thing he missed. Outstanding supporting work by Joseph Cotton and Everett Sloane who portray friends of Kane's who also worked with him, and both with different results career wise. Dorothy Comingore plays his mistress who grows tired and depressed until her only option is to leave. Agnes Moorehead plays Kane's mother who reluctantly makes the decision along with his father that ultimately affects his entire life.

25,29 April 2005,evanston_dad,10, A Reputation Deserved,"There's not much to say about ""Citizen Kane"" that hasn't already been said. I know there are people who don't understand why this film is considered to be one of the most brilliantly made films ever produced, but I propose the reason for that is this: the film and narrative techniques on display in ""Kane"" have become so integral to every film made since that they no longer seem special in Orson Welles' film when looked at from a 21st Century perspective. I encourage anyone still in doubt of this film's greatness to instead look at it from an historical perspective; just compare it to any other movie that also came out in 1941 and I think ""Kane""'s uniqueness will be apparent. I don't think the film is without flaws. Welles' pacing can be slow at times, and I think the last quarter of the movie especially drags. The story itself isn't particularly interesting or even novel for its time, but one doesn't (or shouldn't) watch ""Kane"" for the originality of the story. Instead, pay attention to how the story is told and who's telling it. When the film is over, ask yourself this: can you say you've been given an objective account of Kane's story? Do you really know what happened to him? ",t

Why?... The superb character portrayals... Charles Foster Kane (based on William Randolph Hearst) was a character which sparked a lot of controversy in the movie industry back in 1941!! This film did not even win best picture that year, that award was given to ""How Green was My Valley"". Reluctance to allow a film like ""Citizen Kane"" to be released, evoked a formidable indication that people had a perception of the silver screen as the purveyor of the stilted panacea which provided glossy entertainment for the movie audience!! The ugly depiction of abhorrent human nature that ""Citizen Kane"" so succinctly illustrated, left a scar on the manufactured illusions of movies during this era!! So many film's entertainment agenda during the '30's and '40's were fortified by high budget fantasy!! These illusions orchestrated a premise of escapism that the moviegoers grew accustomed to!!

28,10 March 2006,Hitchcoc,10, Welle's pushed every button,"Many say this is the greatest film of all time. I don't know. It's such a personal comment that I don't believe even a modest consensus can be reached. That said, there is no disputing that this is one of the most influential projects ever done. Having read some books about Orson Welles, I still don't understand, other than having as strong a personality as is possible, how he had the film knowledge and vision that went into this masterpiece, on his first try. There are hundreds of stunning shots. The camera and what it does is enough to carry the film. The editing take us from place to place in a heartbeat. the characters are pithy and interesting, especially Kane. Then there's the William Randolph Hearst thing that is going on in the background. We see power; we see power corrupting. We see love of self contrasted with love of others. We see the oppressive cloud of loneliness descend upon the powerful. Wealth versus happiness. Which is, of course, the overriding theme. If anyone doubts the effectiveness of black and white cinematography, just watch five minutes of this film. More can be done with a few shadows than a full palette of colors.",r
29,13 June 2005,majikstl,10, The Distinguished Citizen ...,"There is a telling moment in CITIZEN KANE that quietly reveals a lot about what makes the film great. It is a scene set in the dark days of the Great Depression, where Kane is turning over much of his empire to his arch-nemesis, Thatcher. As they talk, Kane casually walks away from the camera and we suddenly discover that the room the men are in is an illusion. The background wall that looks to be right behind the them is actually twenty or thirty feet away, the window sill isn't at waist height, but actually is over Kane's head. The room is huge and Kane is dwarfed by his surroundings. Kane than walks back toward the camera and perspective again creates an illusionary intimate image.",v
30,12 February 2007,ackstasis,9," ""I don't think any word can explain a man's life""","Orson Welles' debut feature 'Citizen Kane' stands as one of the twentieth century's most revered films, and, indeed, the title of ""The Greatest Film Of All Time"" has often been bestowed upon it, from as early as Sight and Sound's 1962 rankings, when it indefinitely dethroned De Sica's 'Bicycle Thieves (1948).' After two viewings, I can't say that I find it to be the greatest film of all time, but any work with such a label would find it extremely difficult to live up to impossible expectations. Having said that, however, 'Citizen Kane' is nothing short of masterful. In 1939, in an unprecedented studio contract, RKO offered young prodigy Welles, fresh from his success on the stage and the radio, a two-picture contract with full artistic control (a promise that ultimately wasn't kept). Borrowing elements from the lives of tycoons Robert McCormick, Howard Hughes, and Joseph Pulitzer, but especially American newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, Welles and fellow screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz weaved together the tragic story of Charles Foster Kane, poignantly highlighting the inescapable shortfalls of American Dream.",

42,16 August 2006,Tobias_R,10, The Role of Sheer Chance in Life,"One commentator made the original point that Kane may have uttered ""Rosebud"" as his dying word not because he was nostalgic about his childhood but rather as a symbol of sheer chance in affecting and changing his life. As the commentator pointed out, Kane would never have met Susan Alexander, his mistress and later his second wife, if he hadn't been at a warehouse looking over things from his childhood home. If Kane hadn't met Susan, his life would have turned out quite differently. Indeed, if one looks carefully at the childhood scenes of Kane's life, one would see little that Kane, as an adult, would be nostalgic about. There are strong suggestions his father beat him and that, however caring about Kane's welfare his mother was, she seemed emotionally cold and distant. Indeed, Kane's association of his sled Rosebed with the role of chance in his life would be reinforced by the fact that he was interrupted playing on Rosebud and told by his mother and Mr. Thatcher about the radically different turn his life was taking from that of a poor boy to a quite wealthy one really overnight. Indeed, by subtly showing the decisive role of chance in Kane's life, the filmmakers were undermining the powerful American myth of the self-made man. Hard work didn't make Kane's fortune, it was the result of his mother inheriting the title to a mine thought to be worthless but wasn't.",

Yet the whole film is based on the premise that ""Rosebud"" was Kane's last word and a reporter tries to find out the meaning of the word by interviewing people who knew him. So how could he do this if nobody heard him say the word? Towards the end of the film the butler claims that he was in the room when Kane died. We never saw him in the bedroom but not the whole room was shown to us, so it is very much possible. But why is it that he wasn't shown to us being in the room when Kane died? Given how extremely well thought through the film is it is more than likely that this wasn't only done intentionally, but with a purpose.",

47,30 July 2009,Quebec_Dragon,9, New review from first time watcher: Kane still good today?,"Why another review of Citizen Kane, a movie that made its mark in cinema history and is often regarded as the best film of all time? I'm not sure why. Perhaps it's to put my two cents in and to share what a 36-year old first time watcher but movie aficionado thinks about it. I was amazed it was made in 1941. It's in black and white but has modern original cinematography. It was revolutionary back then and I still regard it as original today. The plays of shadows and lights, who is lit up or not, and how, are not only beautiful but are evocative and serve storyline purposes. The transitions from scene to scene, backgrounds and foregrounds old and new fading out or in, are amazingly well done. Even today, you rarely see anything as artistic as this. The flashbacks and flash-forwards are very cleverly done (witness the diner table scene between Kane and his wife going from early twenties to middle age). The makeup in Kane is for the most part positively astounding and ages the characters better than most modern films. The camera angles are mostly unconventional, playing often with perspective for story purposes (notice Kane smaller in the background during bad moments or bigger than life when things go well). There are quite a few shots (Kane standing underneath a giant poster of himself for one) that are quite memorable and still powerful. I could go on but technically this movie is a marvel even today.",

54,21 October 2007,PWNYCNY,10, Remarkable movie.,"This movie is an expressionist interpretation of a story that, if told conventionally, would be flat. The story is expressionist because it is told from the point of view of the reporter who is trying to piece together the pieces of a puzzle regarding the life of Charles Foster Kane. The only clue the reporter has is the last word that Kane utters before he dies; it is that word that may hold the key to revealing the real Charles Foster Kane. Kane's public persona is a sham covering up a personality that is an enigma. The movie consists of a series of flashbacks as told by the people who were closest to Kane, and who despised him the most. The depicts Kane's life as a series of montages, with wide-angled and close-ups rapidly interspersed, depending on what feeling the movie is trying to evoke, all of which together convey the impression of a jumbled life in which the pieces don't quite fit together. At the start, Kane is young, dynamic, and determined to make things happen; by the end, he is defeated, deflated and behaving like a child. He is angry by the way he was rejected by his parents and has contempt for money, which he associates with the banker-guardian who Kane despises. Kane dedicates his life to spending as much money as he can, and in doing whatever it takes to maintain control, including building a palace and housing it with as many artifacts as he can buy as a way of insulating himself from a world which he finds hostile to him. Kane's life goes into a tailspin after he is caught cheating on his wife, destroying his reputation and revealing him as being a hypocrite. His second marriage, to his mistress, is also a disaster as Kane bullies her into becoming an opera singer just to prove to the world that he had in fact married a singer. He tries to buy her love and when she leaves him, he completely falls apart, utterly alone and unloved, having driven away the last person who had still cared for him. To suggest that Kane deliberately and maliciously used people would not be entirely correct. He was driven to act by psychological forces that distorted his ability to get close with people and ultimately led to his demise. As for the word rosebud, the reported never finds out what that word meant, but the meaning is revealed to the audience, leaving the audience knowing something that the reporter does not know. ",

The movie stars Orson Welles as Charles Foster Kane a newspaper tycoon who recently passed away and a whole lot of reporters scramble to find out what the last words ""Rosebud"" really meant, not only that it also tells the major events that happened in his life. The movie stars Orson Welles in a superb performance as Kane a man who not only wanted to become a newspaper tycoon but also wanted to become the governor of New York state but unfortunately for him lost the election. The movie combines a lot of genres such as drama, romance, comedy, mystery and suspense. Writers Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles made a screenplay that was very suspenseful and interesting and the most important part was what Kane's last utterance ""Rosebud"" really meant. There was a lot of other good performances throughout Joseph Cotten (in his film debut), Agnes Moorehead, Dorothy Comingore, and especially the director, producer and star Orson Welles. the movie may seem a little confusing at times but it still is a great movie.",

Last year Citizen Kane was relegated to the number two spot by the Alfred Hitchcock classic Vertigo (1958). Previously anyone worth their stuff would have to admit that Kane is at least among the best movies to ever exist. So to spell it out, even with some light bruising, Orson Welles's freshman feature has some high expectations to overcome.",
59,15 February 2015,brchthethird,10, Classic Hollywood at its finest,"CITIZEN KANE is one of those films that often makes critics' top ten lists of the greatest films ever made, and has built quite a reputation as such over the 70+ years since it was released. It's also one of those films that people might be familiar with, but may not have seen. And until now, I hadn't actually seen it myself. So, does it live up to its reputation? Yes, it mostly does. The story, if somebody out there doesn't know, is about Charles Foster Kane, who is taken from his parents at a young age to live with a powerful businessman and, once he comes of age, takes over control of a newspaper. Over the course of his life, which is recounted almost entirely in flashback, you see a transition from an idealistic, principled young man to a reclusive shell of his former self. I thought it was a very well-written, well-shot film that gives a very balanced portrayal of a polarizing figure. All of the performances were excellent, especially Orson Welles, who was the brainchild behind this film. I also took notice of the incredible camera-work and cinematography which made effective use of light, shadow and space as well as some really sharp camera angles which provide visual insight into power dynamics that are an integral part of the story. However the most important aspect seems to have been a man who desperately wants love and approval, but doesn't know how to get it except by trying to buy it. It is this single part of Kane that makes him a compelling character, despite being such an enigma otherwise. There was also the film's central nagging question of what his final word, ""rosebud,"" meant. I thought that the answer, which is revealed in the film's final moments, was a bit underwhelming but extremely effective as a narrative-driving device. Overall, this is a classic film that deserves to be seen by all, if for no other reason than that it is an important part of film history.",

Some people will say The Godfather or Casablanca hold that title, but I think it's Citizen Kane. The praise is certainly deserved, because this is certainly is one of the greatest motion pictures of all-time. Much more fascinating is the fact that it was almost never released and close to be destroyed. Welles had already created controversy with his ""War of the Worlds"" broadcast that shocked America, but that was nothing compared to what erupt thanks to Citizen Kane. Newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst believed that the film painted an unflattering image of him and was determined to bury the film, along with Welles. Due to Hearst's power of the press and radio waves, the film was barely advertised and flopped on its initial release. It would also lose the Best Picture Oscar to John Ford's sentimental How Green Was My Valley (considered by many to be the Academy's biggest mistake ever). Kane would disappear and only after both the careers of Hearst and Welles fell did it start to gain an audience upon numerous re-releases from the 1950's onward. It was praised by critics as a masterpiece and Welles was put alongside Chaplin and Ford as one of cinema's greatest artists.

Moreover, there is a consistently precocious tone throughout that a more veteran director could not possibly capture, and this is what makes the film truly unique. It manifests itself in several complementary ways, whether it's the groundbreaking deep-focus cinematography of Gregg Toland, or the propulsive editing by Welles and future director Robert Wise, or the involving whodunit quality of Welles' and Herman Mankiewicz's sharp screenplay, or the meaty performances of a then-unknown cast of stage actors.

And how bad things came to him when he got old. And how he died saying rosebud. Find got the amazing mystery of why he said it. That is if you care boring. Citizen boring that is what they could have called it. I personally do not care why he said rosebud. I could tell you why but I do not like spoilers. All thou I am basically telling you not to see this boring crap. Well save big thrills for people who want to find out. This is one of very fellow movies I have been that looks like a horror movie made in those day but is not a horror movie. The horror movies in those days were great.

90,19 October 2012,ChristophCinema,10, I tried hating this movie,"When I first saw Citizen Kane, I hated it. Why? Because it was called The Greatest American Film of All Time. The first time I saw it, I was 12 years old, and I didn't even care about the movie. I just watched the movie and pointed out all the reasons why this movie sucked. To me, Citizen Kane was The Worst American Film of All Time. Then I saw the film again when I was like 16, and it was a little better. I then saw it the following year, and then I finally understood why it was called the greatest. After that third viewing, I finally had that appreciation for it that most film buffs have. There are many things that make this film the greatest. First of all, the cinematography is jaw dropping. This movie is so beautiful to look at; it almost brings a tear to my eye. The shadows, the angles, the camera movements, everything is just perfect. This may be the main reason why this film is considered to be the best, but there are other reasons too. Another great thing is the acting. This isn't typical 1940s acting; this is stuff that could still win Oscars today. The acting is so good, and the writing is so realistic, that it keeps you hooked from beginning to end. In fact, that's what made me love this movie. The story of Charles Foster Kane is just fascinating, and it's really interesting to see his story told through various flashbacks. The last thing that makes this movie so incredible is the impact it had. When this movie came out, it didn't do too well. In fact, it was like a cult movie years after its release. The film was based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, and he wasn't too pleased with what Welles was showing about his life (like his affair). Hearst wanted to have every print of this film destroyed, but Welles fought for it, and the rest is history. This really pushed the boundaries of freedom in cinema, and just knowing that makes it so much better. What I find very remarkable about this movie is legendary filmmaker, Orson Welles. This was his first movie, he was only 26 years old, and he wrote, directed, and starred in it. The man was a genius, and a true inspiration. Even if you don't want to admit this is the best movie ever made, that's fine. Even if you don't think it's the best, I don't think you can say it's a bad movie. Don't look at it as the best movie, just look at it as a movie, and maybe you'll appreciate it more. Greatest Movie of All Time? Yeah, it's kind of hard not to like it?",

Kane is rather blatantly inspired by the real-life newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, and he certainly didn't consider this to be great honor. He even tried boycotting Welles' film, and partially succeeded as his career never fully recovered from Hearst hatred campaign.

Everyone knew they were vulgar and intolerably pompous, even when they were being made - ESPECIALLY when they were being made - and it's just this vulgarity and pomposity that the rest of the film undermines, in the lively account that follows of what Kane's life was REALLY like.

Thereafter the film's noir shadows complement a descent into a very unpleasant downward spiral until the finale (obviously inspired by ""Rebecca"", produced by David O. Selznick and directed by Alfred Hitchcock, only a year earlier; some of that film's opulent interiors are also mirrored in Kane's extravagant settings).

Many Americans also dislike black and white movies on the simple fact that they don't have color. (""Many"" doesn't indicate a majority, just a statistically significant amount.)

Thats somewhat how this film was then and this time around I know why.The film was in part about Orson Welles own life however much is as I was aware of upon the initial viewing many years ago about William Randolph Hearst.This area is why I recommend the special edition.Hearst is the one who said you send me the prose and I'll provide the war,this is not meant to excite it is meant to warn you as to what your up against.Hearst was a very dangerous and even frightening character because according to the information that was provided he may have contributed to the assassination of President McKinley.This special disc will provide enough material so that you find that when we talk about undue influence,propaganda,areas like creating your own stories just to increase circulation and very unseemly attributes,there was know one more powerful nor influential then Hearst.The idea of what all this influence means was virtually invented by Hearst and this is what I mean when to suggest that what is in fact reality is not the well spring of a Democracy but of a horse of a different color and that is the death of a democracy.There are no dreams only the pedalling of a system and its undue influence and Hearst was an important part of a lie that we are even today suffering the effects of.There is good reason why this film is thought of so highly because like some other films they tend to comment on reality without knowing just how justice in this heart and this mind sees what it has attempted to accomplish.The idea of influence is perhaps like the power of suggestion it electrifies the night air,it maybe the impostor we are looking for,I kid you not.In fact this type of a discourse has provided a underpinning to some of the twentieth centuries most serious calamities.The idea of false importance is of a worthy psychological look see as well as the problem that we are drawn to now take a look at-This film is smart and if such considerations are somewhere even if only on the shelf somewhere it might be worth viewing.These items are of course not mentioned lightly and indeed there consequences do not go away simply,they must be dealt with because this is a problem.In a manner of speaking the call is yours as to the purport of this two disc edition and the films place in film history.P.S. Do not take the idea about ""rosebud"" seriously,upon the initial viewing I seem to recall that rosebud was the name on his sled.This film is something of a satirical look at the life and times of William Randolph Hearst.",

This movie got robbed at the Oscars for reasons that I'll never understand. The quotes are so good and there are so many of them. Welles was a genius that was never fully appreciated even today, probably because most of us forgot about him. I felt bad for him because after he made this perfect piece of art he spent the rest of his life trying to make another one that was just as good or better and which he was never able to do (though it might've been impossible anyway because sometimes you can't beat the best). The supporting actors were fabulous, you just don't see it done this well anymore or anywhere close to it for that matter.

The progress of filming was kept entirely secret from producers and studio executives. The movie is released and William Randolph Hearst leads a vicious crusade to have the movie boycotted. And in the end, everyone recognized that it is a landmark in film making history and perhaps one of the greatest movies, if not 'the' greatest movie of all time; in short, perfection. All of these are pretty odd circumstances for just one film, don't you think? I think so, For perfection is beyond the grasp of human minds and hearts.

I was glued to the screen the whole time, fascinated by the actors, the story, the gorgeous Gregg Toland cinematography. Like countless young film fans before me I suddenly had to see more. More movies by Orson Welles, more movies from before I was born, more movies with decades of praise under their belts. Unlike a lot of modern film fans, I don't bristle when Kane is referred to as the greatest movie of all time. I understand why it's called that and take no offense on behalf of films that are more personal favorites of mine to watch. It's difficult to compare movies when tastes are so subjective. Citizen Kane is called the greatest primarily due to its technical accomplishments and how influential it has been, on filmmakers as well as fans.

146,23 February 2022,nickenchuggets,10, Rosebud,"Perhaps like no other movie in history, Citizen Kane has been praised more times than anyone can begin to remember. Often considered the best film ever made, I had to watch it again yesterday to find out if all these accolades are well deserved or just pure nostalgia and nothing else. To my surprise, the movie doesn't just live up to its reputation; it surpasses it. If you can get over the magnitude of watching what is considered by many the best film of all time, you'll find that Citizen Kane is held in such high regard because the plot feels relatable but unachievable at the same time. When I say this, I'm referring to the main character of the movie: Charles Foster Kane. Primarily based off of the hugely successful newspaper mogul William Randolf Hearst, the story of Kane's life is an extraordinary tale of courage, hard fought success, and eventual tragedy. The film starts off right and gets us interested in Kane's life story almost instantly. At his massive and opulent estate Xanadu in Florida, a decrepit and old Kane (Orson Welles) is on his deathbed. He has a snow globe in his hands. Kane says only one word, ""rosebud"", and then dies. The rest of the film is dedicated to finding out what Kane meant by his last utterance. Jerry Thompson (William Alland), a reporter, is given the job of finding out the circumstances surrounding Kane's final days as well as the meaning of ""rosebud."" Thompson tries talking to Susan Kane (Dorothy Comingore), Charles' second wife, who is now a depressed nightclub owner. Susan is irritable and not in the mood for guests, so Thompson meets with one of Kane's former associates, Mr. Bernstein (Everett Sloane). It's eventually discovered that all the way back in the 1870s, when Kane was only 8 years old, a man named Thatcher came to his home in colorado to become his legal guardian so that he can leave the bleak place of his childhood and move to a more prosperous area. Kane has to leave his parents behind, greatly upsetting him when he was just playing on a sled not even 5 minutes earlier. Many years later, Kane is in his mid 20s and is extremely wealthy, thanks to Thatcher investing heavily in a gold mining operation that Kane now owns. Using his newfound riches, Kane seizes control of the New York Inquirer newspaper company and starts churning out barely substantiated articles about his enemies, degrading and embarrassing them. Later on, Kane's newspaper empire grows even more because he encourages america to fight spain in the spanish american war. Not only this, but he also marries William McKinley's niece. Now that Thompson is getting somewhere in terms of clues, he next seeks out Mr. Leland (Joseph Cotton), one of the few people Kane actually liked. Leland says Kane started to get bored of his first wife and wanted a different one, so he started seeing Susan, his future second wife, while running to be New York's governor. Kane's first wife and his rival in the polls, Jim Gettys, find out what's going on, and the ensuing scandal is catastrophic to Kane's image. Kane marries Susan anyway, but forces her to sing opera which everyone finds to be terrible. One day, Susan tries to kill herself because she doesn't want to sing anymore, so Kane allows her to quit. However, she still remains unhappy despite living in Kane's huge estate at Xanadu, because it's such a big place to live and feels empty. Unable to stand it anymore, Susan leaves Kane for good, and he wrecks her room in a fit of rage. One of the only things not destroyed was the snow globe he had at the time of his death. At present day Xanadu, all the expensive things Kane used to own are being thrown in the garbage or the incinerator. Someone finds the same sled Kane used on that day when he said goodbye to his parents, and throws it into the fire. Unknown to everyone there, the sled has the word rosebud on it. What a movie this is. I can't possibly say enough good things about it. There's a long list of reasons why this movie is great, but one of the most prominent is the way the story is told. Kane's life story is basically told entirely as a flashback, because the film begins with him dying. Even once we get into his life story, a lot of it is told out of order, which defies the more common, linear way of doing things and helps make it more interesting. In terms of camerawork, Citizen Kane has to be on the top of the list when it comes to innovation. I've never seen nor heard of a film that uses cinematography like this one. There's so much style in almost every single shot, and the angles of the shots are so satisfying to look at. Bright neon signs glow in contrast with the night sky, men stand in a room facing away from the camera while their bodies are illuminated by a projector, etc. One of my favorite shots in the whole movie happens towards the end when Kane is walking in a hallway at Xanadu and steps in front of a set of mirrors. I just can't describe how good the aesthetics are. Orson Welles manages to deliver one of the best performances in film history as Kane, as he is realistically portrayed as the business juggernaut of his era. He had so much money and played a big part in many major american events, which makes his death at the beginning of the movie shocking to the whole world. You get the sense that this is a kind of man who has never been seen before. In spite of what negative things Hearst had to say about this movie (because it was supposed to be based on him), I would definitely say Citizen Kane is a strange story in the world of films. Back in the 40s, it failed at the box office and quickly faded from public memory, only to be rediscovered years later and hailed as the king of all movies for 5 whole decades. While I think it's an amazing film, I don't know if I would go as far as to say that. Still, you can't call yourself a movie fan if you haven't watched this yet.",
147,14 July 2018,theterminator-92378,10, A classic for all time,"Rosebud is the final words of Charles Foster Kane and a reporter tries to make sense of just what those words mean and we get flashes into the life of Mr Kane and we see him grow up from a boy into a succsessful business man who takes charge of a paper buisness which leads him to all of the ritches in the world.

However, there is so much more to ""Citizen Kane"" than just a movie, no matter how superlative. ""Citizen Kane"" is nothing more than a priceless document in American history; in tracing the life and career of one man, Charles Foster Kane, Welles presents nothing less than the history of the United States from 1871 to 1941. The film is also a chilling example of the ability of a power-mad media mogul to manipulate public opinion. Citizen Kane could just as well be Citizen Turner or Citizen Murdoch. It's incredible how many careers were launched as a result of this film. Among the uniformly excellent supporting cast the performances that linger in my memory are Everett Sloane as Mr. Bernstein, Ray Collins as Boss Jim Getty, Paul Stewart as Raymond the Butler, and of course the legendary Agnes Moorehead as Kane's mother. The only flaw in an otherwise perfect work of art is the intentionally bad opera sequence, which goes on far too long. No wonder Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore) attempted suicide.

No more than twenty minutes go by and I find myself BORED by this so-called classic. I have to admit I am not a fan of Orson Welles and always thought there was a bit of the smokehouse ham about all his larger than life performances--be it 'Macbeth' or Rochester in 'Jane Eyre' or the attorney in 'Compulsion'. But it is much more than just not liking Welles. I find there is a pretentiousness, an artificiality about the whole film. It's trying so hard to be symbolic about the ""true meaning of life"", much the way 'American Beauty' attempted to show us that there is beauty in a plastic bag floating in the wind. 'Rosebud' is just as simplistic--quite a letdown, in my opinion, to discover that a child's sled is at the seat of the mystery surrounding Kane. Frankly, I just don't get it. What is so profound about this film that historians say it should be shown to young filmmakers as an example of great story-telling? I would rather succumb to the charms of 'How Green Was My Valley' (also in 1941) which took prize as the Best Film of 1941 than have to view this depressing piece of cinema that is supposed to be a thinly disguised portrait of William Randolph Hearst. Intellectuals may love 'Citizen Kane' and AFI must have a number of them on their voting board--but it does not deserve the high ranking they've given it. In my humble opinion, it fails to be even credible. The direction is self-consciously arty (see those unusual camera angles) and the acting sometimes borders on the ludicrous.

170,8 March 2013,AukeBriek,9, How to watch a movie like Citizen Kane? To the film itself!,"How to watch a movie like Citizen Kane? It's supposed to be the best film ever made according to the most prestigious poll in the world, for decades in a row, only recently being surpassed by Vertigo. It seems to me that there are potentially two major factors related to this fact, that might bias and distort our judgment of the film itself, our naked experience of it so to speak. The first one is the most obvious: either a fear of being excluded from the cinema in-crowd, or otherwise just being overwhelmed by all those respectable opinions of all those respectable critics who surely must know what they're talking about, or just plain unintelligent herd-mentality, might cause you to think that this film is much better than it actually is. There is also a less obvious possibility: the fact that this film is so highly revered might cause you to think that you are only bullied into thinking that it is so great, and that you start to think that the only way of preserving your authenticity is to denounce it or to greet it with a lukewarm response. Personally, I know I'm susceptible to both distortions, both based upon the a priori fact of 'Kane' being canonized as it is. A fact that, in these cases of distortion, will determine your opinion of the film, regardless of whether or not you have actually seen it. A fact that may very well blind you completely to ""die Sache selbst"". I think that a phenomenological reduction is in order here. A commitment to completely shut out the knowledge of Kane having the reputation that it has, while watching it. Only then are you perhaps able to actually see the film, let alone judge it. But this is no easy task. In fact it is an impossible task. Therefore, it would seem to follow that it is impossible to watch it. That may be true strictly speaking, but of course not all things are as black and white as the film itself. It is all a matter of degree and a matter of at least trying, or perhaps not of trying, but of letting go, much like 'trying' to sleep cannot be successful when it is literally a matter of trying. But if that is what you shouldn't do, then what should you do? I think that you should let yourself be immersed by the film, let it touch you if it gives itself to you and let it fail to touch you if it tries too hard, if it pulls on your heart like it were only a puppet on a string. All in all, it is your heart that provides you with the most reliable compass. That is not to say that your heart should be opposed to your mind and that if it would 'merely' blow your mind it wouldn't be good enough. Again, things aren't as black and white.",
171,13 December 2014,pleamon111,10, Is it as Good at the Hype? Almost,"In all honesty, I went into this movie knowing about how people call it a film classic so I am not looking at this movie as if it was just released yesterday. One of favorite aspect of this movie was how they didn't just tell the story of Kane's life beginning to end as most movies do, the way Welles used Kane's last words ""rosebud"" as more of an object through which the rest of plot developed was very interesting.

172,30 May 2009,poe426,10, A parable for Our Time...,"One need only look around at the unbelievable number of boneheads on illegally monopolized cable ""news"" channels to draw some very clear parallels between the ""Kane"" of Old and you-know-who of New. Orson Welles may or may not have been sounding a warning back in 1941, but hindsight would certainly suggest as much. Granted, the monopolization of ""The Fourth Estate"" may be almost incidental to the goings-on in CITIZEN KANE, but it's there and clearly delineated. Illiteracy has skyrocketed in this country over the past four decades, going hand in hand (not uncoincidentally) with the rise of television viewing- and, by controlling television (as per George Orwell), we've seen- and continue to see- the ""re-imagining"" of History. It's proving difficult to shake the parasites loose, too, because they've so entrenched themselves in the guts of the mass media that their eventual (but inevitable) departure will leave a gaping hole in our national psyche. The end result of 40 years of two-faced Politics (and complicit lying by the boneheads who've bowed and scraped for so long at the feet of they mastas that they no longer know how to stand upright) leaves one feeling more than a little left out in the cold.

173,29 March 2018,leplatypus,10, CFK (rental),"It looks like Oliver Stone JFK and for me there are real parrallels between the two authors: the beginning of Citizen with his new reels was surely an edit never seen in movies before that: it's dynamic, informative and really cool. Then, the two are really into America and its untold story and deconstructing thee myth of the american dream: they focus on the wealthy and for sure their results is not the sweet tale told by medias! At last, they have a documentary and historical value because we really know better this country: Here, with CFK, we have a amazing look of the famous tycoons between 1871 and 1940 so the time when they were nearly lawless and they amass an incredible wealth without any limits!
But Welles leaves Stone behind because Welles is also highly skilled in drama: Kane private life as an husband is amazingly told: the outstanding Xanadu mansion/castle is used like a Disney animation and really enhances the tension and the visual: it's dark, gothic almost like a Bruce Wayne without the heroics! This slow, nearly total fall of the richest man in America is thus a moving lesson that money can't buy the essential!",
174,16 February 2005,fondablaster,10, About a boy,"A word of warning: The following review and critique contains ""spoilers"" (dialog and plot-points which may - and in this instance - will give away scenes and surprises in the film), but it is unlikely that this will be the first time you have read or heard this information. After all, what can really be said or written about this film that hasn't be said or written before? Everyone who writes about film (from it's release in 1941, to me tonight, to someone else tomorrow) has written something either about or in reference to ""Citizen Kane"". It is a true classic. ""Citizen Kane"" is not only one of the most talked about films ever, it is also one of the most influential films ever. And, perhaps, singularly the best film American cinema has ever produced. Art is a very subjective thing, and this film is clearly filled with it. Only great art or great tragedy can produce such lengthy and long-term discussion. So what can be said that has not been said previously? Let me start by saying I did not like Charles Foster Kane, nor do I believe I was meant to. I do not take for granted that characters must be sympathetic. They do not. There is such a thing as the dark and mysterious (sometimes dangerous) character; someone who, simultaneously, will shock and infuriate us, yet from whom (for some reason) we can not turn away. In other words, it is possible to care about and become involved in the life stories of less than idyllic people. This is especially true with regards to Charles Foster Kane. Mr. Kane is a tyrant. He's as hated as he is feared. By the second act we see Kane as a hostile, detached and driven man. But time offers the unique gift of insight to those who are willing to wait for it. Something did not occur to me until recently (I did not see or hear it in any speech or interview, nor have I read of it in any of the too-numerous-to-count reviews, write-ups and critiques of the film): Charles Kane is not a man at all. He is still the same scared little boy taken away from his home and his family, lost in the wilderness, scarred for life and seemingly irreversible damaged. Now, I am positive that I am not the first to come to this conclusion (simply based on my personal knowledge that I am not that bright), but I am the first (that I know of) to write it down tonight. What do we see in the beginning of the picture (which we don't realize until the end)? The end of innocence. Lost youth. Separation. These are the things that plague Kane as an adult and shape the broken soul who tried to purchase virtue, marry youth and fight for any kind of connection throughout his ""adult"" life. He needed a connection. To anyone. Or anything. Do you remember in the beginning of ""Citizen Kane"" when he says ""Rosebud"" and then drops the snow globe? The butler tells the reporter at the end of the film that Mr. Kane said it twice. You only hear him say it once in the beginning. But at the end of the film, when he tears apart the room after his wife walks out, destroying practically everything, he picks up the snow globe, and is about to break it, but notices the sled encased in it. He is crying and says ""Rosebud"". He then walks past several employees, including the butler (who clearly heard him) and then lies down, says it again, drops the globe and dies. Here is my point: He is redeemed. Regret equals redemption. Kane regrets everything. Susan Alexander, this wife that left him (whom he left his first wife and son for); Kane met her while on the way to the warehouse that contained his youth (including his childhood sled ""Rosebud"" which was his last physical bit of material possession that held any connection to his long-deceased mother). He never made it to that warehouse (that night or any other) because he met Susan. Because of this he never regained, retained or made peace with that lost youth. So instead he tried to buy happiness and marry the youthful Ms. Alexander, in an attempt to hold onto some sort of ideological notion of what childhood could have been. Only after the second Mrs. Kane walks out, and he sees that sled in that snow globe, does he recall what he would have or could have been had he never accepted that ""hot water"" that Susan Alexander offered him on that sidewalk that first night they met. He becomes a man in that instant. Charles regrets everything. Then, he makes peace with everything by remembering everything. And he dies with redemption.",

Orson Welles worked in radio and theatre. He was not practiced in film. This was his first. But all the imagination and passion he had in creating images on radio and in his mind were depicted as ambitiously as they could be in Citizen Kane. It begins with a news reel, then with a scene with several men wherein we never see their faces, but their silhouettes. We see points of view from inside a snow dome and cranking in on us through solid objects like windows and screens and people. Kane has something a lot of movies, even great ones, don't have, and that's raw vision. Raw vision is great, because it's entirely personal.",

So therefore I have always put it off, but finally I put it in the DVD player. Let me tell you, it really is a great movie. Or should I say fantastic movie? We follow Charles Foster Kane, from childhood, to his deathbed. The death scene starts the movie and you hear Kane say the word `Rosebud' and that is what the movie is about, trying to find out what he meant by it.

183,10 November 2010,mjneu59,10, still the Great American Movie,"If Orson Welles' debut feature isn't the best American film ever made it certainly remains one of the most impressive, combining narrative and technical dexterity in a stunning display of talent unmatched before or since. Every scene is a minor masterpiece of style and invention, and the elliptical story of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane, who squandered a wealth he never earned on a woman he couldn't love, is as much a catalogue of camera techniques as it is a compelling drama. It's hard to believe the film flopped at the Box Office when first released in 1941, but perhaps it was simply too sophisticated for widespread audience appeal. Today of course it remains a model of creative entertainment, and a sad reminder of Hollywood's disdain for rogue talent. Welles never equaled the achievement, but even if the film itself could never be repeated the joy of watching it certainly can, and after half a century the rise and fall of Charles Foster Kane is as fresh and compelling as ever. In all likelihood the only viewer left unimpressed by the film was its inspiration, William Randolph Hearst, but what angered him more: Welles' reckless re-creation of San Simeon (Kane's Xanadu), or the true identity of 'Rosebud'?",
184,13 June 2018,JohnHowardReid,10, Citizen Kane was voted the year's best film by the New York Film Critics,"Citizen Kane was voted the year's best film by the New York Film Critics. Ford narrrowly defeated Welles for Best Director.
Citizen Kane was also honored as Best Film by the National Board of Review, while Orson Welles shared Best Acting with twenty other players - including George Coulouris for Citizen Kane.
Citizen Kane came in number four on the Film Daily's 1941 poll of American film critics (behind Gone With The Wind, Sergeant York and The Philadelphia Story). A large group of international critics polled by Sight and Sound in 1971 were somewhat more generous. They named Citizen Kane as the Best Motion Picture of All Time.
In 1947 author Ferdinand Lundberg sued Welles, Mankiewicz and RKO for copyright infringement, claiming that Citizen Kane was partly based on his biography, ""Imperial Hearst"". The trial resulted in a hung jury, the case being eventually settled out of court when RKO paid all legal and court costs and a sum of $15,000 to Lundberg.

Its beauty is an intelligible one; I must humbly admit it took me several viewings, much reflection, etc.,to be able to taste it. KANE is like STALKER, like AMBERSONS, etc.it teaches us that the first impression is crap, is nothing. What should I say about its impressive style, where everything is needed, necessary, useful, functional. There's nothing better; each shot is absolutely functional, each device is needed ,and required by the story. Nothing is formalistic, empty. It is the very opposite of Tarantino, who is made entirely of abundant unnecessary tricks and devices and stylistic gizmo's. The boss picked by Welles to be portrayed in KANE is uninteresting; Kane is of perennial importance. I know no other movie more richly and subtly thought and, in a superior sense, crafted. Missing KANE is missing what is best in cinema. This movie will never be equaled. What heartbreaking beauty! ",
189,24 June 2007,jvincent1,10, What Makes A Film A Masterpiece?,"Is Citizen Kane a masterpiece? The results of the British Film Institute 2002 poll of major directors and critics found Kane to be rated the best film of all time, and Orson Welles the greatest director. Do the intelligentsia of film have the exclusive right to determine which film is or is not a masterpiece? Certainly not. However, the use of the term ""masterpiece"" is being thrown around so casually today as to render the word virtually meaningless. If you look at IMDb's user rating, you would find Citizen Kane ranked #23 and The Shawshank Redemption #2. This is a rating by us common folk, not people who have studied film or make their living from movies. Does this give rise to the contention that The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece also? One may argue the point, and if you read through the user comments, many, many people use the term to describe that movie. I'm sure if you read through the user comments for, say, Pulp Fiction, that ol' word ""masterpiece"" will be there again and again. Check out Forrest Gump. I haven't, but my money says you see that ""m"" word quite a few times there also. After all, it DID win six Academy Awards. If all these movies are considered masterpieces by enough people, does that make it so? I really don't know. I do have my opinion and the privilege to state it, everyone else like it or not. You may disagree with my view, but you shouldn't absorb it and react personally. A masterpiece in film is no different from any other art form. Painting, music, sculpture, literature; some works are great; others mediocre. Greatness must stand the test of time. It doesn't matter how many times you've seen that Dali, listened to Wagner, or read Shaw's play. Each time is the first time. There's a wondrous quality there which fascinates always. A sense of immortality. So, is The Shawshank Redemption a masterpiece on the same level as Citizen Kane? Not even close. Kane meets my criteria as do many others. In fact, in my opinion, Citizen Kane is not even Welles' best movie, so I must think highly of him as a filmmaker. Kubrick, Bunuel, Wilder, Ford, Fellini, Fassbinder, Lang, Ozu, Truffaut, Kurasawa, Hitchcock, Altman, maybe Goddard, maybe Herzog, look out for Tarr, Visconti, the list of great films by great filmmakers is long enough, but not so long that every GOOD film we see is a masterpiece. Let's collar that word and hold it in a safe place before it becomes completely superfluous. I'm sure Welles would approve.",

Basically one of the richest and most powerful in America, if not the world, Charles Foster Kane (Oscar nominated Orson Welles) has died in his mansion Xanadu, uttering his last word ""Rosebud"" (number 17 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes). Reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) is trying to find out what Kane was referring to when he said this last word, so he goes to all the people who knew the multimillionaire newspaper tycoon. Through many flashbacks we see Kane marry the niece of the Presidential candidate, buy many big city newspapers and grow to assume power in many other business fields, to the point where he loses soul. In the end Thompson never finds out what Rosebud was and the reason Kane said before dying, but we see what it was when all his stuff is being burned, it turns out to be his prized childhood sled.

I was impressed with Welles' acting and directing skills, the then experimental camera angles and movements that have become staples, and it is a story with some great moments to keep you hooked. So while I can't see fully why it is excellent and most recommended film, it is certainly one I would recommend, and it deserves to be in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay for Herman J. Mankiewicz and Welles, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Bernard Herrmann, Best Sound and Best Picture. Orson Welles was number 16 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 45 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Films, and it was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Movies (twice).

People, such as Pauline Kael, often admire the ""deep focus photography,"" not realizing that much of it was made by matte shots. The audience is not afflicted with technique; they're simply entertained. Now, special effects are obvious; in this film they are used seamlessly. Filmmakers may study it repeatedly for its methods. No other director could ever match the powerful visual imagination of Orson Welles. No other picture ever offered such a vivid summary of a man's life with such thoroughness and concision. Its shock ending stresses the strength of early childhood trauma in shaping adult lives and delineates the limitations of free will. No matter how public our lives are, our private selves are never entirely clear. The stages of life and the changes we undergo are depicted accurately and swiftly.

Why's citizen kane this good? Because it has actual thematics even today. The whole movie is a sort of mockumentary/fake biopic of a multi-billionaire and some of the events in his life, a sort of a hunt for the scoop made by a journalist. The way the movie's plot is built is just great. Without counting the cinematographic pros that citizen kane has every other aspect was just great.

A great performance by Welles drives the piece. But that's about all it's got. The story is far from compelling and I never felt involved in the character's tale. The use of flashbacks doesn't paint a very interesting or complete picture of Kane, as there is far too much devoted to overlong anecdotes and not enough to the overall story. The Rosebud twist is a nice way to end the film, but I can't judge how surprising or shocking it was, as I had been spoiled long ago. Oh, and way too long, even at only two hours. It just drags on and on. I can see why it's a technical masterpiece, but other that that, it's nothing special.",

226,8 December 2018,andrewroy-04316,9," A wonderful, intelligent movie that is likely the most influential overall to cinema ever","Going into watching Citizen Kane, I was apprehensive that the movie would be beyond me or, through my modern age goggles, I would fail to see any beauty and see just another boring, old movie. I'm glad that those concerns were silly, as the script and makeup hold up quite well today. This is an intellectual film that touches on many aspects of life, but at its core is a deep character study of Kane. The uses of multiple timelines and pairing the early montage with the deep development we get throughout was effective in giving the audience perspective on Kane. We see Kane's self-absorption and lack of empathy play out and devolve his life from one of ambition and enjoyment to, as he eventually has everything material he could want, a sad one where he struggles to find meaning. I thought the rosebud plot point and reveal at the end was absolutely brilliant and actually did live up to the hype it built all movie. In a life where Kane chased fame and the love of others while never really doing anything for others or holding any deeper values or desires, in his last moments he is brought back to that day where everything changed, where he was given all the money he could want and that power so young (along with being taken away from his parents and his casual, carefree playing). He remembers those fun, jovial childhood times with nostalgia, and Rosebud, the sled, is a representation of the undiluted happiness he lost when he received money and power. While there may have been times it didn't engage quite as much (the opera related scenes felt a bit drawn out), it is a great movie whose influence on the great movies that came after it is obvious. I'll have to let it sit in my mind a bit more before I finally decide on whether it's a 9 or 10 for me (I'm leaning 9 now because while it was wonderful and brilliant at many points, it wasn't quite that enjoyable throughout and isn't one I'd think of as one of my favorite or most engaged watching experiences. Its argument would be similar to that of 12 Years a Slave, which was a 10 because it's just such an important, brilliantly made and relevant movie. Between intelligence and influence, Citizen Kane definitely has a case). Either way, it's a great movie and one that actually deserves its regard as an all-time classic.",

240,27 April 2016,CriticalViewing,10, Cinematic and Storytelling raw excellence,"This film by Orson Welles shows the end of the film first, but without explanation. The ensuring story, is about that explanation. It fills in the pieces of it as it goes along from various angles and viewpoints from those who knew him in some way in some point and time, or the few that actually managed to have a close relationship with Mr. Kane, such as his best friend Leland. This film capitalized it's black and white color base, use of low and high camera angles to show the power dynamic, and lighting most heavily to relay this story (outside of the ever clear use of diction in this, and many other, films). The film plays in a staggered time-wave while remaining logically chronological. It progresses with giving flashback moments of a forward moving story that we as the audience know from the opening scene, him dying alone saying ""Rosebud"" with his final breaths. The film makes great use of being filmed in black and white, to have stark shadow contrast, and of light 3-point lighting. Low key lighting is made dominant, but high key is used as well. Just as in life, there are happy times and there are not so happy, dark, fearful, stressful, depressed times. It is an autobiographical representation of real world William Randolph Hearst. Hearst hated the film and fought to keep it out of theaters, away from eyes that would view it and stick to it as truth of the extremely powerful man, how always has an air of a low camera angle following his life. Kane, becomes just as powerful, but the dark side to all of his success, and all of his and those close to him, such as his wife. The Welles rendition both shows the extravagance and aired out the dirty laundry of it all. He kept the fact that Hearst was a hard working man with the drive and ambition, dedication to success and charm, that helped bring him to the top. But he added in the bad, which was distasteful and unacceptable to Hearst. Still this film remains in circulation, and the cinematic prowess with which this story is told remains one of the many great American film classics.",

3. The set and costume design is great, and their changes to match the different time periods is exquisite.
4. The score does a really good job at switching up the tones, whether it be a jovial, intimate or serious atmosphere.
5. The comedy is well-placed, and suitably light and fluffy.
6. The cinematography is gorgeous, especially the framing of the shots and the aspect ratio 1.37 : 1 adds a more personal feel to the film.
7. The lighting is used tremendously to convey the intended emotions, as well as adding aesthetic touches to the scenes.
8. The ending is incredibly impactful and saddening, especially when compared to how Kane started and where he ended up. The last couple of shots, as well as the last lines of dialogue, really help to ram home the aforementioned impact.",

246,25 September 2011,Bloodwank,10, Truly one of the deserved classics of all time,"How to understand a legend, and the man within. Thats the enterprise that drives Citizen Kane, a mission of layers that begins and ends with Xanadu, and Rosebud. At first we get the newsreel account, facts and knowledge but its a mean rendition, notes that point but say little. And so the process begins of unwrapping mystery from memory, the search for Rosebud. Xanadu says as much as the final revelation though, stately pleasure dome never finished. Coleridge never finished Khubla Khan to his satisfaction, his committal to verse on an opium dream interrupted by a guest and left to inadequate completion, and here Xanadu is a symbol of Kane and his own quest for dream interrupted. Even as the film unwraps the man through memory and its branches, in the end understanding can only be limited, the man who resides ultimately within his own mind is only understandable to himself. Which is not to say that the film is oblique, on the contrary it is a fine, scalpel slicing dissection of a man, his rise and fall, his companions and works. Orson Welles gives a towering performance as the title role, from a young turk beaming with energy and arrogance, to crusader then to stubbornness, unerring commitment to himself above all things sowing his downfall. For all the character's flaws Welles brings sympathy and tragedy to the role, in bringing clarity and perfect nuance to every stage he conveys to the audience a deeper understanding than what is said by mere words or events and thusly provokes sympathy even when one would perhaps like to dismiss him. The cast around aid the journey well, the exasperation of George Coulouris as Kane's guardian and fluster of Erskine Sanford as a traditional newspaper owner usurped by new practice make for wry amusement in the early stages, Ruth Warrick handling with great subtlety the first shifts towards downfall as Kane's first wife, Dorothy Comingore (though histrionic in places) deeply affecting as his simple, honest and lovable second. And best of all Joseph Cotten as an old friend bearing the greatest insight and hardest fall. With such performances and finely judged writing its a classic tale of corruption, greed and the peril of relentless drive. But underneath it all the search for a man within a legend. And one of the greatest things the film does is not just highlight futility but cast doubt on the very search. Its in the cinematography, the use of light and shadow. In general terms the superb work of Gregg Toland gives the film an often shadowy mood suggesting depth even when the actors aren't at work, but whats really interesting is the refusal to give face to the journalist pursuing the story, only those he speaks to, only what is relevant to Kane himself. In shrouding the journalist and his masters particularly in shadow and dark a great gulf is established between the world of Kane and his contemporaries and those who seek to unfurl said world. If Kane's wives and companions are at a remove from him, the seekers after truth are removed even from them, impossibly far away from deeper insight. Which gives the film dual interest to me, the mind, how it seals itself off and the impossibility of knowledge. Perhaps Citizen Kane is not the best examination focused as it is on a fairly classical story, but its certainly one of the very most accomplished and entertaining. One of my favorites so far of the established canon of cinema, and hugely recommended.",

I thought this film was great. Orson Wells does an awesome job telling a story through flashbacks. The dynamic between the characters is really cool as well. The acting, I thought, is really what shines about this film. Wells plays Kane himself, and no one could of done it better. Wells knew exactly how he wanted his loud, commanding chapter to be portrayed and he did exactly that. The editing is another great part of the film, flashbacks can be tricky but Wells does a graceful job in depicting it. The only criticism I would have is the dialog at many times seems like filler, as I was lost at time about what they were talking about, it seemed nonsensical. However, I sort of enjoy this aspect of movies sometimes, when the dialog is entertaining, which is true about this film. I would recommend it to anyone. It is truly a masterpiece in film.",

Don't get me wrong, this is not a mega-Hollywood blockbuster. There are no explosions, the movie is sixty-four yrs. old, and it is in black and white. Some people will stop reading this here, but I would seriously advise anyone who has not seen this classic story of power, life, love, loss, and death to rent or buy it immediately. The B&W cinematography, and the nostalgic, almost haunting feel to the lighting and the ""deep focus"" camera-work draws you in to the outstanding visuals. The visuals! From the opening shots of Kane's storybook like castle (no reavealing anything about that here!) to the crane shots over the bar in the rain, the movie is a stimulating and detailed picture to watch. Not only that, but the story is rich and detailed, and structured beautifully, with Orson Welles playing the title role as a recently deceased newspaper tycoon, a la William Randolph Hearst. A powerful and both loved and hated public figure, a young reporter is sent with the task of finding the meaning of his last words, and in turn takes a journey through flashbacks and meetings with various people connected with the gigantic tyrant. You leave the story as confused and as haunted as you come in, but it doesn't matter. The acting, visuals, and timeless story draws you in and leaves you with a film classic that is not easily forgotten.

The 10+ minute intro that is a newsreel sets up a dual story, one in the ""present"" (1941) of a reporter trying to figure out what Rosebud means and snapshots of Kane's life, a bit like one's memory. This is especially relevant with people talking of ""fake news"" today as Kane goes through life buoyed by a paper that literally prints fake news. Orson Welles carries the movie as Charles Foster Kane, the wealthy newspaper publisher whom doesn't care about anyone else but himself. The ending of the movie, with the meaning of Rosebud clear to the viewer but not found by the reporter is gone, almost like it dies with Kane. This movie was detested by William Randolph Hearst as it is based loosely on his life.",

I especially like the lighting used and the way it fit the plot of the movie. The long scenes help build the plot and draw the audience in. The plot focuses around the word Rosebud since they were Citizen Kane's last words he spoke before he died. The story was simple and easy to understand even though the use of flashbacks that were somewhat out of order.,

259,1 November 2016,PetarNeo,9, Magnificent or not?,"Movie focuses on our man Charles Kane that was taken as a boy by a wealthy man and had opportunity to became what ever he wanted but instead of hopes that everyone else imagined he would be, he ended as a leading man of New York Inquirer. Whole movie spins around last word that Kane said which was Rosebud and throughout movie a man is getting stories about Kane and everything that he did. There is a lot of tension and mystery in the movie as plot goes with some incredible dialogues but after some time movie starts to feel like it's going to take forever to get even slight evidence of what really matters in the movie. How time passes it is evident that our leading man has changed very much and he just wants to be understood but everyone is leaving him slowly and it is killing him. There are some hits of what Rosebud might be because of globe with snow inside it brings memories from his childhood and that it had to do with time when he was still with his real parents and in final scene you are revealed that while his snowboard is burning down that was the mystery. It is incredible movie making and script writing alongside with some great shots taken but that doesn't compensate for very long and at time boring and meaningless scenes. 3.5/4",

I never knew what the film was about even though it has been referenced to so many times in the media. The only thing I knew about it was the infamous ""Rosebud"" scene and that is it. Other then that everything else was a complete mystery to me. And after watching the movie I can safely say that it deserves all the recognition that it gets. What I simply love about this film is that it simply is going and discovering the life of Mister Kane. Just who he was and how he got to where he is. And the great symbolism in the film with the first and last scenes will make you wonder why you didn't think of that being one of the answers to the question, what is rosebud? Either way it is one film that everyone needs to see at least once in their lifetime. Because if you don't you'll be missing out on something amazing.",
261,1 February 2005,barleeku,10, Give Welles due credit as actor,"Enough has been said in the comments about the use of lighting, directorial and editing techniques, etc. I love this movie and each time watch it enthralled. The plot moves along brilliantly, and while many of the techniques have been applied by countless filmmakers since, there's still something about seeing the trailblazer in all its glory - especially as it still holds up. But I just want to give Welles due credit for his acting. I think part of the absolute magic and impact of this film is Welles' ability to transmit a sense of someone larger than life in every way. When he's caught up in the chase of a great story - or the creation of it - his intelligence and vision and sheer conniving brilliance emanate from his every gesture and word. He is expansive and dynamic, he was incredibly handsome, and he seemed to burst from the screen when playing the young Kane. The figure of Welles himself creates a powerful internal tension within the film because he lights up an otherwise dark, morose palette. In many ways, his character has nothing to do with Hearst - Welles himself was a force of nature, and in some ways Citizen Kane is a prophetic vision of his own fate in Hollywood. Welles was a great actor, as was his co-star, Joseph Cotton, one of the great understated actors of the screen. Cotton is a perfect foil for Welles - as he is in that other absolute masterpiece (not directed by Orson), ""The Third Man"" - because he hints at his own uneasy depths which are always being stirred up by Welles, whether as Kane or Harry Lime. I also see the end of Apocalypse Now, with Brando's dark, isolated, ruminating semi-madman as an homage of sorts to Welles alone in Kane's castle at the end of Citizen Kane. The two greatest burn-out male geniuses of the American silver screen, both gorgeous in their time and both expanding into bloated ruins, their ""potential"" often seen as unrealized - but both perhaps having transcended even those expectations of themselves.",
262,18 March 2011,mnpollio,4," Years after the controversy, the film fails to stand on its own merits","It is virtually impossible to come across a 10 Best Films List from any ""serious"" critic or film institution that does not have Citizen Kane ensconced in the Number 1 slot. I have literally heard film historians who insist that if you don't like this film, then you don't like films. Well, I happen to love films and I do not especially like Citizen Kane and, refreshingly, I see from many of the comments there are legions of people that also do not appear to like this film much either. Much of the aggrandizement stems from the high esteem that the film industry and critics held auteur Orson Welles and the empathy they had for Welles in the obstacles that he faced in making this film. Yet while one can appreciate the single-minded ferocity an artist can have in bringing forth a vision – one must also admit that many times the end product of that vision is not a masterpiece. Welles' melodrama, which is a thinly veiled depiction of the life of legendary power broker William Randolph Hearst, put him on the wrong side of the publishing magnate, who did not like having his life be the subject of a film and set forth the dogs of war to try to hamper Welles. Many critics gathered around Welles and starting inventing superlatives to describe the end result as an antidote. At the time, this picture caused quite the controversy and became a cause célèbre. Unfortunately, decades after the death of Hearst, when many new film watchers barely know who he was, the film must be judged on its own merits and not the controversy it caused in its day, and that is where the film falls apart.",

When the movie released, Hearst wanted Citizen Kane to be destroyed, and never seen by anyone because the movie pretty much tells about his entire life. There is so much more about what happened in between Hearst and Wells, but it is an amazing story. Citizen Kane is a perfect definition of an excellent movie.

Welles was probably lucky he wasn't killed, literally. Listed as No. 1 on the AFI top 100 films of all time I think it falls just a tad short. I'd have been more than happy to see it in the No. 2 or even 3 hole behind ""Casablanca"" and ""The Godfather"" respectively. The film still is an awesome piece of American film-making and in my opinion represents one of the first great 'indie' films as everyone aside from R.K.O. turned away the young upstart and his blasphemous script (with credit to his writing partner Herman J. Mankiewicz). The film is thorough in bringing along for the journey, even if it does hit a hump at the midpoint it follows quickly enough to keep us interested. Obviously it has survived the ultimate test, which is time, to prove itself since it was basically left for dead upon original release. It also didn't help that 'Kane' is one of those films you really do need to take in more than once to fully appreciate the film-scape. (In tribute, just see their reference in an episode of 'Family Guy' as ""Two long boob-less hours!"") Given that Orson Welles was a filmmaker well ahead of his time, it leaves one to wonder what his legacy may have been if 'Kane' had been more widely accepted by the film industry and the populace. Unfortunately we are left to realize his greatness too close to his death and well after it. How things may have been different in Hollywood as a whole if he had been anointed the master director and ringleader of the Mercury Theater he was instead of relegated to studio actor under the 'Dream Factory' thumb. Luckily, we'll always have his 'one hit wonder' (to those who simply ignore his body of work) to remind us of 'wasted potential' (due in NO part to Welles' own effort) in epic film.

The first time I watched it I didn't care much for the film or the characters but after about 10-15 viewings it's gotten to the point that the last 40 minutes have me on the verge of tears.

Every word he says seems to be a contradiction or spite until you realize that the whole time Kane was simply a puppet trying to grab hold of his own strings destroying himself in the process.,
305,15 October 2005,djohn2581-1,10, This film should be number one............,as it's probably the best and most intelligent script ever written and it's splendidly and brilliantly directed and acted.,
306,29 January 2007,Keenan_Investigates,10, A lot less heavy than I expected,"I went into this knowing of its great reputation, but fearing it would be very slow and boring with a lot of dialogue and a heavy 'moral message'. Although it did have an underlying message (and a very strong and well made one too), the film wasn't at all what I expected; the camera work and music in particular livened it up, and at times it was quite light hearted. I think this helped make the emotional scenes all the more powerful. It kept me gripped all the way, and I don't have a long attention span. The acting throughout is superb, with very little of the overacting that you might expect from this period, with Welles in particular giving an outstanding performance in the lead role. My advice is give it a try, even if you think it's not your type of film.",
307,17 November 2003,JPTaylor,10, Deserving of its praise.,"""Citizen Kane"" is a film I find truly graceful.  The story is portrayed so elegantly, so subtle and yet simple at the same time.  Its message is not earth-shattering or prophetic - instead, all elements of the film are focused on the small, yet significant story of one man's search for love.",
308,28 January 2014,booklover1,10, A Masterpiece,"The first time I watched Citizen Kane, while I appreciated the technical advancements and its influence on film in general, and while I thought the film was fantastic, I didn't really believe it to be the film to end all films in the aspects of character, plot, and entertainment. However, recently I decided to re-watch a lot of ""Classics"" that I watched at a younger age. Movies like Gone with the Wind, Crash, Avatar, Vertigo, Rear Window, the movies I watched as a kid and liked (Except for Rear Window, for some odd reason) but I never considered the best. While I haven't gotten to the movies I just listed yet, I did manage to sit down and watched Orson Welles's masterpiece, Citizen Kane. And you know what? I finally got it.",
309,2 November 2012,alejandrothedirector,10, One of my new favorites,"I had always admired Orson Welles but I'd never seen any of his films. I admired him because like myself he was an actor, magician and film director. I've always known that Citizen Kane was considered to be the greatest film of all time by many critics and yet, I still hadn't seen it. I finally got the opportunity to watch the film for the first time recently and it's climbed to become one of my favorites. Citizen Kane has themes as old as literature itself: love, ambition, corruption and the price of success to name a few. These themes are part of the human condition and some of my personal favorites, so the film strongly appealed to me. The most impressive asset of the film was Welles. In addition to directing and writing the film, he also starred in it. Considering that this was his first film and he was given complete creative control by RKO, it was monumental. The film's cinematography for its time was groundbreaking material, with camera shots that had never been seen before or had just been emerging, such as the use of deep focus so the audience looks at the whole scene. Knowing a little on Welles' personal life, one of the film's most interesting aspects was that in many ways Welles was Kane, gifted and a slave to his own hubris. The film portrays a life of riches as poor substitutes to love. All Kane ever wanted was to be loved like every human being, but he was stripped away from the moment he was taken away from his parents at a young age. He spends the rest of his life trying to relive that childlike wonder, which is what his sled is symbolic of. If he can't be happy, then he makes the lives of those around him miserable as well, such as pushing his second wife Susan towards an opera career that she never wanted. He spends his later years in Xandu, his own castle. He spends fortunes on statues, to the extent that they completely occupy his home and he even has doubles of the same ones. The only two possessions he cared about were his snow globe and his sled, which reminded him of the life he wanted to rekindle. This is filmmaking at its finest. Welles pushed the boundaries and made the film his way, with his people without RKO breathing down his neck. I believe the only criticism a person could give is that it is boring to them, which is a fair complaint considering the plethora of films that are out there today and how much more technologically advanced Hollywood has become since the early 40's. I feel as if ambitious or intellectual men will get the most fulfillment out of Citizen Kane. I personally give it a perfect rating.",
310,4 November 1998,Tetsel,9, Everyone's missing the point.,"Yes, I understand that this is America, and everyone is entitled  to their opinion, and many like to ""rate"" things, trying to figure out who is best, who is second best, etc... Well, yes Citizen Kane has been called #1 on many lists. However, these lists are made by professionals, and they look as much at technical issues as anything else. And they are just lists. Let me say it again, and this applies to everyone's lists, not just the critics' : they are just lists. The great directors, Welles included, do not (and did not) make films to beat out other directors on lists. This is not college football here. This is art. And, it is entertainment. The film has been around for 57 years, and every sort of person has seen it in every sort of way with many different intentions. Therefore, opinions will vary to such a degree that any sort of ""absolute"" ranking, comparing it to other films, should be looked at as mere fun, just something to give film lovers something to talk about. If you see this film and you love it, it may be because the plot intrigues you. It may be because you appreciate the innovation of the directing, or simply that you love old movies in black and white! ""Greatness"" is relative folks, and I hope you all at least enjoy yourselves a little bit as you make your lists.",
311,5 November 2016,CaptainCutie,9, Incredible movie,"Citizen Kane is most definitely a must see classic of American cinema. It has fantastic cinematography and is just an overall outstanding film. In my opinion while watching this film you can't help but to feel bad for Chsrles Kane because throughout the film we see that everyone that enters into his life eventually leaves him and it is causing him a lot of pain. However, I also thought that great skill was used throughout the staging and shooting process of this film. The film really does show the audience watching how talented Wells really is. He acted in this film as well as wrote it and I believe that this gave him a great advantage when he created this film. Since he had wrote for the film and was starring in it as well that gave Wells more control of how his vision was portrayed on the screen and it worked out very well. Overall this is a very well put together film that I enjoyed.",

We may have money, power but we can't be happy without love and peace. In this Kane had power and money everything but at the end he wasn't happy. Once he wanted to work for the betterment of the citizen but now all he wanted to have more and more money .He tried to buy everything with money. Kane's first wife left him because of his affair with Susan . He built a opera and hired teachers to teach Susan singing but all in vain. Money can hire teachers but can not help one to learn singing. He never tried to know her feeling or to understand her. She felt suffocated by seeing his money power in everywhere. So,she left him and said,'' You don't love me,you want me to love you''. Kane became all alone ; he already lost all his friends previous wife and kid for his behaviour. While dying, he remembered his childhood when he was so simple, was not powerful, all he had a skate board written ''Rosebud''.",

I won't even waste time talking about technical aspects because this is simply flawless! I thought that I'd seen beautiful movies in my life but this one is unmatchable!

I thought that maybe because I've had five years to grow and mature that I would give this film another chance and watch it for the third time in my lifetime.  Guess what?  My opinion has changed.  I hated it then and now I just dislike it quite a bit.  And the question that I have is why? Why is this film the masterpiece that people say it is?  Is it really because it revolutionized film back in the 40's?  Okay, so it invented the wipe and it had lots of different styles of lighting.  That may make it brilliant on a technical level, but come on people, you cannot tell me that this is not one of the most boring films ever made on the face of this planet or any other planet that has theaters to watch movies in.  How can you get excited about a film that creeps along like a snail moving across a highway in the middle of nowhere?  I really feel like Welles is taking all of you  for suckers.  Because I think he set out to make a boring film just to see if audiences would have an orgasm over it because of its technical brilliance.  I still think he is laughing.  I know I would be.",

318,20 January 2005,robsha,7, Life through a snow globe,It would be difficult at best to contribute any insight in what might be the most analyzed movie of all time. So I think I'd like to just give my initial impressions of this film after seeing it for the first time in over a decade. This is a hauntingly powerful work. This is a film that many will relate to and revisit mentally. The strength of the film lies in the writing. The unique way in which the story is revealed and the smart believable dialog. The technical aspects are also unique and the use of light is superb. It's one of the best and certainly one of the first. Some of these images will sear themselves through your eyes into your brain. Orson shows his story telling and visionary talent in this piece. He was well beyond his time which is why his peers booed this film multiple times during the academy awards. It's looks as though Orsen had the last laugh as this one time art house film becomes one of the films against which all others are measured.,
319,21 October 2014,JosephPezzuto,8, Reel Look: 'Citizen Kane',"""Rosebud..."" When experienced screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz collaborated with Welles on a screenplay originally called ""The American"", it was going to be based on the life of Willaim Randolph Hearst. Hearst in his time had put together an empire of newspapers, radio stations, magazines and news services. To top it all off over his achievements and successes, he then built to himself the flamboyant mansion of San Simeon; a castle that only came to be furnished by rummaging through the remains of numerous countries. What more can be said about this milestone in cinematic history that has not been said to death? I, in turn, will continue to do so thus. Let's take a look.",
320,19 July 2000,ivan-22,2, Sophomoric gargoyle,"I like Orson Welles as a person. He was warm, witty, intelligent, a great conversationalist. So, why do I have such an intense dislike for his entire body of work? I find his films nauseatingly morbid and draining. These very, very dark films make the darkest film noir look like a light comedy. My least favorite of his films is ""Citizen Kane"", a veritable compendium of everything that should be avoided in films: time spans that are too long, villainous heroes, insufferable pretentiousness and gross overreaching. This film unintentionally glorifies Hearst. He did not merit such a hatchet job. It honors him by implying there is complexity in the man. One gets the feeling that Welles secretly admired Hearst, and that behind the critique is a bit of envy.",

I couldn't agree more with that person after seeing this movie. First off, I love what Welles does in the very beginning of the film with the news real about how Kane dies. Right off the bat, the end of the movie is given to you. Some people may hate that because it ruins the end immediately, but that's not the point of this film. Through incredible acting by director Orson Welles, you embark on the journey of a man of poverty into a successful publisher and politician eventually. The cinematography in this film is some of the best I have seen. One of my favorite scenes is the camera work done in the scene where the reporter enters the large private library that contains Kane's journal. The camera work done in that scene is magnificent. Also, the lighting done in Kane's political speech gives me a feel kind of like the Nazi party following Hitlers speeches. Makes a feel of full attention on the man and how important he is. Overall, this film may be the best work I have seen out of a director. Absolutely wonderful.",

The cinematography was beautiful, kudos to Gregg Toland. There was focus on the intricate settings, but also on the emotional expressions of each character, connecting their feelings with the love they have for the deceased Kane. The camera panned, shaped, and angled so that it felt like we were on those stairs when he shouted at Getty's, it felt like we were there when the results of the election came in as well. Another great aspect were the players, introducing stars that became well known to the public after the movie was put on the big screen.

The sum of it all is; yes, the film is fascinating just as it is thoroughly engaging and brilliantly made.

For us, Rosebud is the name of the sleigh with which Kane hit Thatcher when he was little. It's a name of change, a very important name in his life. It dies with Kane because it is actually him. For Thompson, Rosebud will be another piece of a jigsaw puzzle he could never find. But the viewer is redeemed through all the things they learnt from Kanes life all these years.

The following is purely my opinion on the movie. I'll try not to go into much detail about the movie itself. Let's just think first when this movie was made, 1941. The story starts with Charles Foster Kane ( The protagonist. ) dying and breathing out his last words which were ""Rosebud"". So, from the beginning of the movie there's an enigma, what is ""Rosebud""? A journalist who'll write an article about the death of Kane tries to find the meaning of this word. So, with a lot of flashbacks and a flawless storytelling process we get to know who Kane was, where'd he come from. He's nature, he's good characteristics and his bad characteristics. We get a taste of how his life progressed. What I liked about Citizen Kane except from it's mystery and simplicity is how well we got to know our protagonist. By the end of this movie you may or may not understand what was the meaning of ""Rosebud"". I just have to suggest one thing, try and watch it. If you like it, you'll watch it again. If you don't, give it an another try and if you still don't like it then you never will. It's one of this movies that passed the test of time and still matter because in it's core, it's a movie about a human being. It was a classic ""must-see in your lifetime"" movies that really lived up to their hype!",
339,1 September 2013,uhrig888-677-841561,10, A work of art,"I don't know if there is such a thing as a ""perfect"" movie, but this comes as close as anything I have ever seen. I recently re-watched Citizen Kane for the first time since high school. I don't know why it took me so long to watch it again, probably because the first time I saw it I was a little underwhelmed. I'll just chalk that up to immaturity though, this is most certainly one of the best films I've ever seen. Students of film history can tell you all about the innovative camera techniques and such that make this film very important. I prefer to just focus on the actual experience of watching it. First of all, every scene (and I truly do mean every scene) is absolutely visually stunning. You could pretty much take any individual frame and hang it in a gallery, it is that meticulously put together. Aside from that, it's just a great story. I don't usually find biopics about ""great men"" very compelling, as they have a tendency to elevate people to this almost god-like, larger-than-life status that causes me to just become disconnected and not care at all about the main character. Citizen Kane does precisely the opposite, it takes a ""great man"" in the eyes of society and brings him down to a human level. Ultimately Kane is just like everyone else, a man in search of lasting happiness that proves more elusive than it seems it should. If you haven't seen Citizen Kane, or even if it's been a long time, then go watch it as soon as possible. You certainly will not regret it.",

A melody such as the ""What is his name?"" tune is sung vigorously at the Inquirer Party, is heard again played more aggressively at the political rally, becomes sadder after the election defeat, and reappears behind the credits. The breakfast scene between Kane and Emily was cut to correspond to the music, Welles patterning the montage of shots, one shot successively superimposed on and then replacing another, to follow the movement of what Herrmann called his ""ballet suite.""

355,10 February 2014,campbell-russell-a,8, A cold and lonely lovely work of art?,"It is easy to see why some people wonder how Citizen Kane appears first or at least in the top five on all-time great movie lists. It lacks so many things that we like about movies. It has very little action and there are few if any characters that are likable or for whom we feel anything. There is nobody we worry about or cheer for. The storyline is also minimal and the final revelation prosaic rather than genuinely meaningful. The word ""Rosebud"" was a McGuffin and just a rather contrived excuse for doing a fragmented biographical piece on a newspaper tycoon. The film has been lauded for its cinematography, innovative direction, stylization and perhaps its soundtrack both in terms of music and sound effects. However, for many it becomes a case of the director packing too many tricks into a film rather than using them only when they truly add to the meaning or impact of certain scenes. Hitchcock loved having a subjective camera search for its protagonists as in the start of ""Psycho"" but Hitch knew when to say when with his cinematography techniques. Lastly, I can understand that some would say that by the constant over-rating ""Kane"" over the past seven decades, it has led to a blindly uncontested acceptance of its greatness. Few would dare to call the Mona Lisa an over-rated painting of a renaissance woman who just wouldn't say cheese.Perhaps the thing that is most unappealing to some is the lack of warmth or charm. Is it just too clinical? Is it the product of a mind that had little or no real empathy with the rest of the human race - somewhat like Kane who campaigned for the rights of the people without the slightest hint of understanding their point of view?",

Seen only from the perspectives of his friends after his death and from the cold machinery of a newsreel, no one really knows Kane, and sadly not even Kane himself, who after being second-guessed out of his childhood and subsequently second-guessing himself throughout life in search of his new stage or ""snowglobe"" in which to play, finds himself gazing through his own void, in pain and depression, with only the frozen memory of his happiness uttered in eternity through the walls of his palace in a single word. Through greed and misanthropy disguised in benevolent intentions Kane finds himself in a prison of things and empty halls, all new toys he acquired and just as hastily discarded, still a child when he played newspaper man, collecting his statues like action figures, all more things to fill the empty void in his life. When the one person he comes close to loving, Susan Alexander, leaves him, he no longer has anything to cling to and so destroys himself and lives a life of regret and longing.

Welles is also superb in the lead role, playing the title character from young adulthood to old age, with the assistance of some excellent makeup. However, as impressive as it is, none of the supporting characters are all that well drawn out or acted and the use of music in the film feels inappropriate and it detracts from certain scenes. In terms of film techniques it was groundbreaking in its time, and is still quite admirable even by standards today, but as an overall film it is just not quite as satisfying as what it could have been. Still, it certainly is interesting in terms of plot, with issues of love, fame and happiness amongst others in the film, and it certainly is a film great.",

It's brilliance is trumpeted by better than I for years before and to come.  And yet, here's my two cents. ""Citizen Kane"" is a perfect film.  There's amazing camera work and editing techniques (not the first to use them, but the first film to use all of them in one film to artistic success), fantastic acting (they are acting 'on the line' or 'in the moment', and they are not over-the-top as was common at the time), a terrific story (made all the better by it's factual basis), and characters are ones that we care about (ibid). The frame is filled with small details that add to the scenes. The language and vocabulary are ones that remind us of the beauty that English can achieve, calling up mental images that are left un-painted on the screen but burn brightly in our minds.  The lighting is evocative, but not overly moody.  In short, everything works. The message is one of simplicity (be a human first, a collector and achiever second), yet is subtly delivered that you could easily watch this movie for the characters, the story, the action, the dialogue, or whatever you wanted to. That is the genius of this film - there is something for everyone to love in it, and it does it so successfully that it's difficult imagining anyone walking out of the theatre saying 'I can make better films than that.'",
367,9 March 2008,Dr_Coulardeau,10, A cult film that has become a myth,"The natural question ,we have to wonder about when watching this film, in its new splendor after restoration, is whether Orson Welles did not try to make a movie about himself. He sure did. I would even say it is a posthumous autobiography in prospective expectation. It is an American film about America and the Americans. The grandiose grandeur of those who are dreaming America into being and the petty narrow-mindedness of those who are only defending their own interests. Which tribe is most important? No one can know. The dreamers get isolated and lonely, at times in the golden heart of wealth and money. The self-centered ones just cut the cake and are very careful to give a very thin slice to others and an enormous slice to themselves. Then they all die sooner or later and only the dreamers survive. The others disappear in the darkness of hell, the underworld of forgotten anti-history. But this film reveals, and at the time it was probably scandalous, the power of the press as for building public opinion and the absurdity of the Americans as for forbidding politicians to have a normal private life, I mean the right to have a private life of their own and only their own. The tragic dimension of this character is that he is trapped by the very first, the power of the press he had used tremendously and had even boosted up in incredible proportions, with his very private life. Then the rest is only vanity and vain pretence: he tried to prove what he did not have to prove and he used other people to do so, particularly his second wife, which led to the end of the dream that had turned into a nightmare with a brain stroke and death. One can only prove what is really real and not what is virtually eventually maybe possible. Then of course we have to admire the technique of this film and the marvelous black and white finish and gloss. We also have to point out the film is renewing the genre of the biography of a great man by creating some mystery around one word, ""rosebud"", which probably has no value at all and is there to make us look at the pictures and images with a more attentive eye, as if we were supposed to be private eyed sleuths. Some say this film is a masterpiece and they must be nearly right. They would be totally right if they said it is one of the few masterpieces of the war years, the years that needed some boosting of the Americans and America. Orson Welles did it with a big tongue in his vast cheek, but probably had more positive effect than all the propaganda films that were filmed by second grade ""directors"", if they can be at times called directors at all.",

375,5 May 2004,daveb75,10, Great work of poetic art,"""Citizen Kane"" is a very mature film. And you have to participate, as a viewer, to get into this one. For example, the use of short lenses with everything in focus (background, foreground, etc) forces you to choose for yourself what you think is more relevent in the frame. Welles and Tolland never impose their vision on you. It also gives way to overlapping dialogues, which was unheard of back then, and still is rarely seen in standard Hollywood movies. Same thing with the editing. Welles seldom cuts in talking scenes, instead he just keeps long takes rolling, therefore, once again as a viewer, you have to participate and focus on what you think is more important in the scene, rather than have the habitual overuse of separate talking heads forcing you to see one actor and not all of them. In ""Kane"", you can witness all the characters' reaction to the events. Sometime Welles will cut only at the very end of a dialogue for dramatic emphasize. Then, there is the structure of the film. Everyone seems to think they knew the real Charles Foster Kane. But nobody really ever knows everything about another person. That's both the beauty and the tragedy of any human life. But by giving us first of all the death of the main subject with his final and famous dying word, Welles is using a gimmick to allow us to witness different recollections by the people who think they knew him best. But the bottom line is, all they can do is give us a rendering of different events and can never get at the heart of the man. And that's why no one really knows about Rosebud. ""Kane"" never had a huge budget but it made a wise use of special effects that don't call attention to them like ""The matrix"" does, for example. That gave a grand look to the picture. But you never realize it as you're watching the film. There would  be a lot more to say about this wonderful work of art, but it would take years to match all that has been written about ""Citizen Kane"" and a lot of people explain the film a lot better that I can. I'm just asking the potential viewers of Orson Welles film to use a little intelligence while viewing it. It's a piece of poetry. Even Jack Kerouac was flabergasted by the  poetic aspects of it. It gave new meaning and exploded boudaries for cinema. So to call this film dated, to me is like saying that Beethoven's fifth symphony isn't worth listening to because it's been made so long ago. Time doesn't have an effect on true works of  art except to keep them alive and aging well, like a good bottle of wine.",

Ray Collins, Agnes Moorhead, Joseph Cotton and Orson Wells all made big impressions later on in their careers, but this film is just too boring and you don't care about the characters. First issue: boredom...CK is not boring because of the age in which it was produced - Gone with The Wind, Double Indemnity, Mrs Miniver, Casablanca, The Postman Always Rings Twice, The Big Sleep all belong to this era and still hold almost every movie fan's attention from start to finish, even after repeated screenings. Perhaps CK is warning us against the evils of materialism, which is laudable. Kane has millions and spends compulsively until it doesn't interest him anymore. He acquires one fantastic woman, battles with her, then finds another. Wife #2 is a hotcha-girl and seems none too bright, but she's just ignorant and her character-development is the one truly interesting thing about the entire film as her gathering sophistication reveals an intelligent and finally independent woman. But, little else interests me very long. We're told about his wonderful, massive house and don't get to see much of it. Kane never seems to have much fun and I don't care why he doesn't. The odd, stark shots of theatres, libraries, offices, etc. bored me stiff the first time I saw the movie and are still just a bunch of stuff to plod through the next time I watch it. Second issue: Why don't I care?? We're treated to that ""Rosebud"" remark early on, but I can never find myself caring about it. So what if it's the sled he had as a little boy. The movie doesn't make me care about Kane either as adult OR child. Mr. Bernstein is a likable kiss-ass, he admits, and he's mildly interesting. Jed Leland goes to one of Susan Kane's operatic performances, gets bored with mediocrity and is too cowardly to finish a bad review, gets drunk, gets fired. Hoh-hum. Mean old Mr. Thatcher is a little interesting, and his final scene with Kane is a humorous island in a sea of mediocrity: Thatcher and Kane should be good, old friends - - they even finish each others' sentences, but they're old enemies and always will be. Then everybody gets old and/or dies. So what? God willing, that's what'll happen to most of us. This movie shows us that, as time goes by, the once young and lively become old and slow...then the Kane's life is over and there's a half-hearted search for Rosebud and nobody ever discovers the origin of Kane's dying remark.

No film has ever captured a self actualized person like Kane, a man who has everything and can do virtually anything he wanted.

392,4 August 2012,farshadnm,9, if not a masterpiece at least a great movie,"before i watch citizen Kane i was expecting a complicated, boring and slow paced movie. nevertheless i wanted to watch it to see what is all the fuss about. and i was surprised that it was a well made movie and i understand why people calling it a masterpiece of all time. i watched it once and maybe there are somethings that i didn't pay attention to. but anyway, this is my review of the movie. keep in mind that English is not my first language, so i apologize in advance for any possible error. ..... when Kane was a kid his parents send him to city so he may be fortunate and wealthy and have a better life. he loved his mother and didn't want to go, but his mother chose that wealth is better than love for him. it made an impression on Kane. he for the rest of his life seeks love through wealth and fame. he tries to buy the love of people, friends, even his wives with money. he can't love, but wants to be loved. he lost millions of dollars trying to keep the newspaper running because he doesn't care about money, it doesn't mean anything to him. for him, it is a tool to buy something that he didn't have as a child. at the end of his life, his wife was the last person that could love him and when she left, there was nobody else. people didn't love him, his wives left him, he fired his (maybe only) friend and he realize that he lost everything he fought for in life. when he see the snow ball, it reminds him of the day he was playing and making snowman when he was a child. it reminds him a name, a name that he forgot for a long time, ""rosebud"", the sled he used to play with as a child. rosebud is the reminiscent of his childhood. the story is good, acting is good and the way of story telling is great. it was not boring or complicated for me, but i get it that for some people it may be boring. many people says that the movie has a slow pace but i disagree. the only problem i can think of is that it is hard to get attached to characters and i think that's why some people get bored. but i was interested in the story and Kane's character and followed the movie easily. citizen Kane is a great movie and i know i will watch it again some day.",

The ""Santa With Muscles"" equivalent of the 1940s, sans the only redeeming feature, Hulk. The acting was atrocious, the story dull, and the action scenes decidedly lacking. The fact that this film possessed contained some of the more innovative special effects to plague the filming industry (Such as a mono-colour scheme) did little to relieve its monotony. And honestly, who didn't expect the ending? It's no wonder that Orson Welles never found work again. The brief appearance he made in ""Ed Wood"" was more than excessive for a man who didn't breathe at the time of its production. Citizen Kane? More like Citizen Pain!",

All you need to know is this: EVERYONE who has some association with film has seen Citizen Kane at least once. It's become the go-to example for comparing other movies against.

When a movie is so hyped up you can't help but be dissapointed but on my second viewing I was amazed by the film. This is probably the best experience I've ever had watching a film.

It's equally as difficult to find another movie that has had such universal acclaim, and at the same time, as much scrutiny. For over 75 years Citizen Kane has reigned as possibly the greatest motion picture ever created. It was directed, produced, written and brought to life by cinemas enigmatic master, Orson Welles. When media mogul and American icon Charles Foster Kane, played by Welles, suddenly dies, the world wonders as to the meaning of his last spoken word 'rosebud'. Only one man could arouse so much mystery and intrigue around something seeming so trivial, and even in death, the most polarising and powerful man America has ever known, still has the masses wanting more.
The story of Citizen Kane is told to its viewers within the first 15 minutes, and the finer details are witnessed through flashbacks by the people who were closest to him. Kane is a selfish, vain and utterly ambitious man who looks to further his own social standing not only through his professional life but through his personal endeavour's also. We see Kane as an innocent young boy, unfazed by his controlled surroundings, to a dictator like leader in command of his own fateful future. This movie, through the passage of time, has been challenged by many other classics as worthy contenders as the greatest film of them all and it has seemed to hold up as well as its rivals. But Citizen Kane is a film that marches to the beat of its own drum, it's unparalleled in many aspects and is unlike any movie seen before or possibly since. Simply amazing.",

For instance, the movie used a lot of really low and really high camera angles, which were pretty cool. I also liked, during the scene when Thatcher was speaking to Kane's parents, how you could see Kane through the window outside playing. It was really cool because you could see how happy he was with his life the way he had it, while at the same time people were planning what would turn out to be an empty, unhappy life. I also thought that how the plot moved forward by jumping around in time through flashbacks was really cool.

This is a film that's very much of its time, yet it still has this timeless feel to it, mainly because it tells its tale so well. The second half of the film is as near perfect conclusion as you'll ever likely get from any film, the direction was way ahead of its time, and there's a great sense of sadness that runs through almost everything that still holds up even today.

This film was the first to really integrate the perspective of the viewer to make an emotional and psychological impact outside of the typical movies of the time.

It's about a newspaper mogul who basically runs himself and his newspaper into the ground because of his incredible stubbornness, but this story is unbelievably well presented.

This mystery surrounding him makes Citizen Kane a masterpiece.,"Having completed the core story mode of Team Bondi's LA Noire a night before watching Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, I realized the non-linear viewpoint narrative was common in both the game and the movie. There were crucial decisions to be made in LA Noire that could wrongfully prosecute an innocent or acquit a criminal, and the information we had about them was majorly through third party sources. In Citizen Kane, the first twenty minutes of so, with the exception of the mysterious opening shot, presents Charles Foster Kane as an wealthy, ostentatious and over-ambitious business tycoon whose life has seen major ups-and-downs and whose final years were spent predictably behind the walls of his palace like many other wealthy magnates. The media's perspective is not completely spurious, in fact Kane is wealthy, highly ambitious and grandiose, but that is not how his life should be defined or confined to. The 'Rosebud' puzzle leads to a week long investigation by a journalist Jerry Thompson in which he meets those close to Kane who are still alive.",

433,19 October 2012,kendraocon,8, Really good movie!,"I thought Citizen Kane was a really well written movie. The movie kept you interested the whole time, he didn't seem to repeat much of the same techniques or types of scenes which I thought was the most interesting about it. There was definitely some odd point of views and perspectives, but this movie was odd in a good way so therefore it worked. When they first started off the movie, they showed the body of Citizen Kane, I liked perspective of the camera, you were aligned with his body. They also were showing newspapers of Kane's death, with an added voice. I liked the scene were all the men were gathered in one tiny room trying to find out how to publish his death, with the light seeping in from the windows hitting causing a outline of light to hit their faces and heads while the rest of their bodies were black or dark. You don't know what rosebud is and either does anyone in the movie, I liked that point of view. The light in this movie is just awesome,they used low key lighting. They did a crane shot when they were introducing Ms. Alexander, I like how they changed up the camera angles and did not keep it at just plain old eye level. With the mystery type of movie, I think the different angles, perspectives, lighting and other techniques just made the plot even stronger. I also loved the lighting in the room in the Walter Parks Thatcher Library, it looked like light beams were shining down on the floor and the man was very confined in there, with just a long table and a chair. You really understood Mr. Kane with all of the flashbacks of his life, they brought you back to his childhood and you could sense how much this child would change. I thought it was interesting about the flashbacks and that they were through other peoples eyes and not Mr. Kane, they were still sharp and very clear to understand despite them being from someone else's eyes.",

I just know that the whole thing contains a great message. The narration is insane too, the complexity of time within the film, and the plot as it's winded in so many different directions. The film in its style and speed feels fresh enough. But the story is not a new one, although it is a thought provoking and well-told one, it felt a bit too much for me in this day and age.

They end up never finding out what rosebud meant but at the end of the movie the viewers learn that rosebud was the name of the sled he was playing with as he was taken away from his mother. I found this movie very interesting and it left me wanting more and more information on Kane. I loved the flashback included because it really explained who this man Kane was. He's a very good character and the actor did a great job at portraying him. I would recommend people to watch this because it's an interesting and mysterious type of movie that is easy for anybody to enjoy and understand.

Is it a...Wait a Minute!,"""Citizen Kane"" is one of the most excellent masterpieces ever seen on cinema. It was produced, written, directed by, and starring Orson Welles, when he was just 26 years old. This movie is one of the first movies ever to accomplish such unique technical advantages, and it redefined the legacy of cinema. The movie begins as Orson Welles, playing Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon, who is introduced in the opening scene, on his deathbed, saying his final word, ""Rosebud"", before dropping a snow-globe to the floor. Then, it follows to the perspective of a reporter who is investigating the meaning of ""Rosebud"", and it leads to a series of flashbacks that shows glimpses of Kane's life. Okay, let's just say, I enjoy black-and-white movies a little bit, but the thought of seeing this was just plain enjoying. The story was found fascinating and interesting, but it's not really spectacular and remarkable. But it's Orson Welles that helped lead the way to show cinema the true meaning of filmmaking. I also enjoyed all the innovating camera techniques used to make the movie more unique, which includes so many uses of deep focus, long shots, soundtrack, film editing, transitions, shadows, and lighting. These techniques were too impossible to accomplish in the past, but it was Welles that made the impossible into possible. From an interesting script to a fine cast, it just proves that ""Citizen Kane"", after many years, is still a movie that impresses audiences everywhere, with a movie that beat the odds of cinema, and it's an incredible recommendation for true movie lovers.

I found it creative that the film started at Kane's death and then went backwards in an effort to show his life journey, while the reporter, Jerry Thompson, searched for the meaning behind Kane's last word, ""Rosebud"". It showed the growth of a man born in poverty who makes it lucky when a gold mine is discovered under his mother's property. Kane grows to be a charismatic man loved and looked up to by many. However his personal life lacks, as what happens to most people who experience such wealth and power. It was a lesson of the things that matter in life. The scene where Kane throws and breaks many objects in his room after his wife leaves him. This scene shows a different side of Kane, and as the viewer I felt a lot of sympathy for him, as though he was looking back on his life wondering if all the wealth was really worth it.",

Some men will spend there wholes lives trying to create a movie as amazing as this and most will fail yet Welles hit this one out of the park at such a young age! On top of that it was Welles first film ever made! The success might be credited to that Welles was given full creative control of the film by RKO Pictures. The use of sound in this film is unreal, and it seems like every scene can be deconstructed to find 100 different meanings behind every characters action and the objects/places that surround them. This Film à clef uses exceptionally peculiar narrative and direction to tell you the story of Charles Foster Kane. Starting from Kane's last words, going to a news real, then jumping between the interviews of reporter Jerry Thompson to the flashbacks of the ones he questioned. All this accompanied by daring and creative cinematography and amazing acting by Orson Welles and his crew solidify this piece as cinema gold.

Imho the main reason is none of the characters are likable and several Bernstein, the reporter, second Mrs. Kane are annoying and shrill. Even Kane himself , can anyone honestly say they care about him?

It is well lit at the appropriate times, but not without the occasional blown out or 'underexposed' shot to demonstrate certain circumstances like being in a dimly lit library or being outside. The lighting is actually very interesting to watch in this movie due to Welles' tendency towards very dramatic lighting schemes. The editing, also, works very well, with clips 'layered' over top of each other to show the passing of time and other such things.

The story is expertly told and very well paced but the story itself was not particularly interesting on its own. Wells is a massive presence so there is not much room for anyone else to shine but the rest of the cast do a fair job. It's an impressive film for its time but by the end the story is well and truly told; it didn't leave me wanting any more.,

Hollywood did not like him because at the time he was a maverick.  He didn't play by their rules. Citizen Kane had lighting and set design from the stage.  This made the camera angles even more extraordinary.  This was not common at the time. The acting by all was superb.  The story technique of using flashbacks has been copied and copied. It was by far the best use of this.  It is an original work.  It surpasses all of Welles' later works.,

491,15 March 2006,johno-21,10, All great films are overrated. That's what makes them so great.,"This is a great film and was recognized for that immediately. The National Board of Review named it Best Picture for 1941, the New York Film Critics Circle named it Best Picture for 1941 and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated it for nine Acadeny Awards for 1941 including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, Best Art Direction and Best Music Score. It won it's only Oscar for Best Screenplay for Orson Welles and Herman J. Mankiewicz. 26 year old Orson Welles in his feature film debut produces, writes, directs and stars in Citizen Kane, a story of a young boy whose family gives him up to be the son of a wealthy man who will guarantee a privileged life and education for the boy. He grows up to lead a newspaper empire and become the world's most wealthiest man and political pawnbroker. Welles had captivated the nation with his radio play adaptation of another Welles in H.G. Welles War of the worlds in 1938. He took his Mercury Theater Players and made the leap from radio to film and produced an epic film his first time out. He was fortunate to get some smart help to bring his vision to reality. First, with veteran screen writer Mankiewicz helped to write a story for film instead of radio. Second, with veteran Cinematographer Gregg Toland who had photographed such films as Queen Kelly, The Westerner, Kidnapped, Wuthering Heights, Intermeazzo and the Grapes of Wrath among his many films and after Kane would go on to do The Outlaw, The Best Years of Our Lives and The Bishops Wife before he died of a heart attack at the age of 44. Toland had worked with Directors Erich Von Stroheim, Mervyn Le Roy, Howard Hawks, King Vidor John Ford, and William Wyler and brought the skill to put Welles' imagination on the screen. Third, Orson Welles found a young film editor who had edited The Hunchback of Notre Dame and My Favorite Wife named Robert Wise who would go on to be an accomplished director himself with such films as The Day the Earth Stood Still, West Side Story, The sound of Music, The Haunting, The sand Pebbles and The Andromeda Strain. Fourth, Welles was entrusted with and got the best out of RKO veterans Art Director Van Nest Polglase, Set Director Darrell Silvera and costume designer Edward Stevenson to work on what would be the most important film of their careers. Fifth, Welles was fortunate to have a young composer named Bernarad Herrmann score his film. Herrmann would go on to be a favorite of Alfred Hitchcock scoring his films Pycho, The Birds, North by Northwest and Vertigo and would score films and television for directors all the way to Taxi Driver. Next, Orson Welles had fortune with RKO Sound Supervisor John Aalberg overseeing the sound for Citizen Kane and finally Welles was surrounded by a great cast in Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick and Everette Sloane among others. Vision, ambition, inspiration, skill, talent and a little luck came together for Welles who was teamed with a lot of talent that collectively wanted it to come together. It results in a 10 out of 10.",

However, I believe that it should be evaluated as a film, I mean above style, content and story. Citizen Kane is a good classic, yes its direction was beyond its time by far, but nothing more. It is an interesting biography of a newspaper businessman, an interesting work, but nothing more. And as I see, critics love this film more than us, because as said, they try to evaluate it in a objective way, it promoted cinema, so a masterpiece. Orson Welles's not only Citizen Kane was beyond its time, there are some other examples, especially, the story editing of Kane is beyond its time, brilliant (the story telling method used in the movie is not similar with any movie you have ever seen, from a picture projector, Kane's life is summarized!), but generally, as a film, it is just good, a plain movie. By the way, the people who see it the greatest don't explain why it is the greatest. Because, they cannot find any reason? The film is stylish visually and in contrast with a lot of people, I forget rosebud completely while watching the movie, because it swept me away. It is not the ninth wonder of the world.

512,19 March 2020,Dello_,9, Excellent but not the G.O.A.T.,"I was very interested in ""Citizen Kane"" because of all the praises I've always heard about it. I have to say that the movie is really good and its age is nowhere to be found, something that only the great movies are capable of. The screenplay is brilliant because it narrates the life of a man (I've read it was inspired by a real person) in very particular way: the first thing that happens in the movie is the death of the protagonist (Mr. Kane) and all the narration follows Mr. Thompson, a journalist that is in charge of solving a mystery about this man and the film jumps between different periods of Mr. Kane's life. There's a study about his life, his motivations, his merits and his weakness showing the results of the choices he made or others made for him. It's also great how the viewer perceives him because of the peculiar arc that he goes through. The other great thing of the movie is the direction that is inspired and enriches every dialogue. But now that I praised the movie for his qualities I want to say that I feel this movie is ""a bit"" overhyped. It's great but there are quite a few better movies. Is ""Citizen Kane"" a precursor? Yes. Did it influence the cinema industry? Absolutely. Is it like Dante Alighieri's ""Divina Commedia"" that a lot in vane has tried to reach? No, in the following 80 years there have been some (but not so much) better productions.
If you are interested in watching ""Citizen Kane"" you should clearly do it, but do not except to see the best thing of your life because you can probably been left disappointed.",

They need to be constantly entertained every second before they lose interest or they'll walk off and find something more visually arresting to entertain themselves with. It's sad, but I believe it's true. Citizen Kane influenced film-making period. Not just a particular genre or a director - film-making. I can understand a person not understanding all its technical achievements, after all most of us didn't go to film school (I sure didn't).

It's been 80 years since this movie came out and it is still gripping, relevant and awesome. Leaving behind the countless ways this movie innovated and inspired countless other filmmakers to come after it, Orson Welles' masterpiece works as a drama, a movie filled with suspense and simply as a brilliantly told story about a very powerful man's life. I believe the last scene in the movie puts everything together nicely, when the newspaper guy says something along the lines of ""I don't believe one word can define a man's life. Charles Foster Kane was a man who got everything he ever wanted in life and then lost it. Rosebud was something he couldn't get."" I think this refers to how every single decision we make in our lives is important, and ends up tilting things towards the better or worse. Even though Charles Foster Kane found material success, his relationships suffered and therefore his own soul suffered, too.

Don't expect to love this movie right away after the first time watching it. Citizen Kane is a movie that should be watched several times.

533,13 November 2003,clarinetgirl25,9, This movie is definitely one of the best,"The movie upon which all others are based is and always will be `Citizen Kane.' Although loosely based on the life of the infamous William Randolph Hearst, `Citizen Kane' depicts a power hungry man who's life spirals from the lime light down in to darkness. This movie filled with superior lighting, music, camera work and acting is possibly one of the best movies of all time. The movie actually starts off at Charles Foster Dane's death. As he whispers the name Rosebud. A snow globe is dropped and shatters. With this the flame of Kane's life is blown out. The audience is then shown a news report about the incidents of Kane's life and opinions from critics. When this news reel is over, a room full of reporters decide that they need to figure out what the word Rosebud meant in Kane's life. This leads to the rest of the movie as they interview Kane's closest friends. In which the characters in the movie never find out, but only the audience alone is shown the missing piece of the puzzle. The beginning of the movie starts out with the upward shot of Xanadu, Kane's castle. The end  of the movie is shown  with a downward shot. This shows the beginning and end of Kane's life, and is just one of the great camera shots in `Citizen Kane.' Another wonderful shot is when Kane is shouting at Gettys. He is looking down stairs that descend in a spiral. This symbolizes the same spiral that Kane experiences in his life. Probably the most profound shot in the movie is when the candle is blown out during Kane's death. This obviously shows that Kane just died. Rosebud, the last words of Kane serves as the plot for this movie. Although the audience finds out in the end that it is the name of his childhood sled, it can also symbolize other aspects of Kane's life. A rosebud starts to sprout and bloom in the spring. Which symbolizes hope, and a new beginning, but then it soon blooms and dies. This is much like situations and people in Kane's life, after one rose blooms and falls he must find another. Kane was a man that was always searching, but never found  a rosebud that never dies but always in bloom.",

538,29 March 2020,LolaVavoom,3," Alas, I simply cannot understand the hype","After many years of procrastination I have finally decided to watch Citizen Kane. There has been so much said about it that I expected something truly outstanding.
Alas, I simply cannot understand the hype. I was astonished to discover that it has been called the greatest film of all times by so many. Try as I might, I just could not quite see that. Perhaps I should have seen it as a teenager, surely it would have left a better impression then. Unfortunately, neither the story nor the visuals speak to me. It does seem unusual and I appreciate that it would have been really innovative at the time however the story appeared to me as empty as a tin bucket - a lot of melodramatic noise with very little substance and mostly underwhelming acting. So much hype about a simple story about an arrogant man with a chip on his shoulder who turns abusive and controlling instead of achieving anything worthwhile, an ode to an empty life.
I am glad that I finally saw it and can remove it from my list of cultural pieces I wish to be familiar with. Perhaps I am missing something important there although the desire to find out more is very slim on my part.
To recover from this lucklustre experience I decided to watch again The Very Same Munchhausen (1980) which I consider to be if not the greatest then certainly one of the greatest films of all time. Every sound, every look, every word speaks volumes and there is so much meaning behind every scene. Perhaps my taste is just different.

Most movies that work at such a pace are often extremely difficult to follow and have the viewer lost after the first hour, but with CITIZEN KANE it all flows seamlessly. The use of flash backs is also very well done here and it is one of my favorite things about the movie, especially when they're used at the right times and aren't to weird in some way.

548,13 March 2018,e-clayton-01810,7, Citizen Kane,"I had very high hopes for Citizen Kane. First off, the cinematography was amazing. There was a consistent yet still complex way to how it was shot. For example, there were scenes where the opening would be a close up of someone's face while at the same time you could see another subject in the background, just as in focus as the main image. This opened a few scenes and was stylistically a great choice. 
The plot was great, I loved how detailed and complex it was. The flashbacks were done very well and did what they needed to do. They helped move the plot along but in an artistic and helpful way. The acting was great. The only thing I had a hard time with was the overall point of the film, but I can see why people liked it so much at the time. However, even given its historic/political tones, as a viewer I found it to be a very basic, white washed story. It looked great and was told well but meant nothing to me as a young person in 2018.

Despite the fact that Kane was one of the wealthiest and compelling men in New York City, he was definitely hopeless. This is an exemplary model of how cash cannot purchase happiness on the grounds that regardless of how much an individual reaches to obtain the things around him, it means nothing if he is not happy. Money gives people stability and extravagance, but this does not imply that the individual will be truly satisfied. Like Kane, in spite of his astounding wealth, he had always gotten more money, only to spend it negligently to suppress his inner sadness. At the end of the film, Kane loses everything, and his expression ""Rosebud"" is eventually uncovered towards the finish of the motion picture, symbolizing Kane's youth.",
554,10 January 2019,bwright68,10, Innovative Elements of Citizen Kane,"Orson Welles's Citizen Kane is a landmark in the history of Hollywood filmmaking. This is due in no small part to the unprecedented amount of creative control ceded to him by RKO Studios. Welles was unquestionably a genius, but his uncompromising desire for artistic integrity, coupled with filmic concepts and production methods deemed unconventional at the time, would prove to be not conducive with Hollywood's powers-that-be. Regrettably, the degree of freedom that would foster the realization of his cinematic debut was to never reoccur with any of the enfant terrible's subsequent films. As such, the magnum-opus that is Citizen Kane survives as a lasting testament to its auteur director's innovations. Welles's editing, cinematography, narration, mise en scene, sound, acting, and props are crucial elements in this regard.
Welles's manipulation of time was crucial in maintaining Citizen Kane's non-linear story. This was achieved, in part, through transitions consisting of dissolves and form cuts. For example, when Kane, the new owner of ""The Inquirer,"" asks why rival newspaper ""The Chronicle"" has a larger circulation, his loyal associate Bernstein (Everett Sloane) attributes it to their journalistic integrity. To clarify, he points to a photograph of ""The Chronicle""'s editorial staff. The image proceeds to fade out into a slow dissolve while simultaneously transitioning into a form cut of the same staff-members in identical staging positions, except this time posing for ""The Inquirer""'s photoshoot. Thus, Welles's cinematic language wordlessly advances the story by eliminating the time needed to show Kane buying his competition's integrity and loyalty.
The theme of being bought and sold applies to the protagonist's childhood as well. In particular, the scene when Charlie's parents ""give"" him to the banker Walter Parks Thatcher (George Colouris). In this instance, cinematographer Gregg Toland's use of deep focus and long camera takes help tell the story. The short lens used in this example provides the large depth of field which allows us to clearly see Charlie playing outside the window in the center frame's background. He is also the dominant in a frame within a frame, foreshadowing his imminent entrapment and loss of innocence. Additionally, the long camera takes give us time to take in information about the adult characters based on their acting. For example, the stern countenance and stoic posturing of Mrs. Kane (Agnes Moorehead) in the right foreground emphasizes her concentrated control over the details of Thatcher's contract (which is appropriate since it involves her son's welfare). Despite her patrician facade, Mrs. Kane wants Charles to have a better life, even if it has to be with a Wall Street executive as his guardian. Her husband, on the other hand, shambles from middle-ground to foreground, all the while babbling ineffectually like a doddering old fool. He is clearly not in control of the situation. The wide angle lens of deep focus photography allows all four characters in the shot to stay in focus regardless of which distance plane they are positioned in. Additionally, the lack of distracting edits allows for every aspect of the performances, along with the well planned mise en scene, to be taken in by the viewers on their own accord.
One way the apportioned facts about Kane are taken in by the audience is through the film's innovative narrative devices. There are two examples which occur early in the film that help us learn about our protagonist before we actually hear him tell his own story. The first way is achieved via newsreel footage announcing his death. It begins with the booming, non-synchronous narrator's voice announcing the death of Charles Foster Kane. Descriptions of his wealth and influence are accompanied by transitioning wipes of Xanadu (Kane's palatial residence), his extensive art collection, and a multitude of guests enjoying their stay in the war-profiteer's estate (an optically printed Adolf Hitler among them). The narrator also explains how the scandal of the newspaper tycoon's extramarital affair with Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore) cost him his bid for politics. The second way we learn about Kane occurs in the darkened screening room when the ""March of Time"" newsreel ends. In his attempt to humanize Kane for a follow-up report, the newsreel director demands more background information on the deceased magnate. We are then able to parse out bits and pieces of speculation amidst the din of overlapping dialogue (a common Welles trope) that follows, including the current whereabouts of his second wife, Susan. This also provides a starting point for lead reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) to begin his investigation.
The starting point for the audience's investigation begins with the establishing shot of Xanadu. This same imagery also appears at the end of the film, essentially bookending the story. Although both emphasize his wealth, each scene offers a different takeaway for the viewer. For instance, the film opens with an ascending crane shot over the wrought iron ""K"" atop Xanadu's main gate. In the distance, Kane's palace (a matte painting) looms in the misty background which, like the protagonist, is shrouded in the unknown. Although we know little about Kane at this point, the roaming camera reveals a private zoo, golf courses, and docked gondolas materializing out of the fog. Clearly, a wealthy individual lives here. However, after we learn of his death, our perspective changes. For example, at the end of the film, a bird's-eye tracking shot (the camera mounted on an overhead cable) curates over the labyrinths of Kane's crated artwork. Xanadu's captured collection of empty opulence is not unlike that of the pyramids; both retaining riches of dismayed men inside their sepulchers of shattered dreams.
Occasionally, ear shattering sounds serve as signals for transitions occurring in Citizen Kane. Although the godlike newsreel introduction, ""News on the March!"" is a salient example, the most innovative (and bizarre) use of sound occurs in the third act to herald his wife's flight from her gilded cage. As the shot begins, a loud screech is heard from an enormous Cockatoo optically printed on the left side of the frame. Presumably, only the audience sees and hears the Cockatoo, although it's quite plausible the birdcall emanates from an aviary in Xanadu's zoo. This diegetic sound effect nonetheless signifies Mrs. Kane's cry for freedom, as well as mimicking her limited operatic vocal range. The bird's image then cross dissolves into a full shot of Kane approaching the bedroom, inside of which Susan hastily packs her suitcases. Like the Cockatoo, Susan Kane is seen by her husband as an object of beauty that must be amassed and stored alongside the other symbols of his material wealth. Like using his newspaper as a platform for yellow journalism, and the questionable ethics employed in his vying for public office, Susan's exit is another failure at control which leads to Kane's disillusionment.
The believability of Welles's character metamorphosing from a young entrepreneur into a disillusioned old recluse can be partly attributed to make up. However, the real method behind his portrayal of Kane's age progression is due to a convincing acting style. Originally trained as a stage actor, he cut his teeth treading the boards at an early age. The magnified emotional and physical expressions needed to convey the character's inner moments to a theater audience were perfectly suited for Kane's boundless energy and subsequent lethargy on the big screen. The scene, for example, in which young Kane is seen cavorting with all the dancing girls in ""The Inquirer"" newsroom is bristling with sheer youthful exuberance. The ceiling in the room is low, making it appear as if the structure itself cannot contain his energy. As he reaches middle age, his mannerisms are replaced by less physicality and more bellicose oratory in his self aggrandizement. The shot in which he confronts Boss Jim Gettys (Ray Collins) in Susan's apartment is an example of this. As a younger man, he would have likely resorted to violence in the face of his opponent's blackmail threat. However, Welles' indicates Kane's decline with slower, more deliberate movement, such as his decision to not pursue Gettys down the apartment building's stairwells. Instead, he resorts to blustery bravado on the upper flight (like his campaign podium), exclaiming,""I'm Charles Foster Kane!"" By the end of the film, he is an aged and broken man alone in the cavernous catacombs of Xanadu. His girth, borne out of Dionysian decadence and disappointment, causes his trembling legs to shuffle along at a hesitant gate. Welles's innate theatrical dramatics conveys a visceral decrepitude, contributing a great amount of pathos to his iconic emergence from the ruins of Susan's bedroom. As he lethargically lumbers past his shocked domestic staff, and between two opposing mirrors, Kane's spiritual nadir is endlessly repeated into the illusory vanishing points of the props' myriad of images.
The prop that is most germane to the theme of Citizen Kane is the ""No Trespassing"" sign posted on Xanadu's main gate. Like a hieroglyphic curse intended to thwart grave robbers, the sign decries prying into Kane's enigmatic persona. At the outset, its mute warning goes unheeded by the advancing camera's single-minded scrutiny, as unyielding in its movement as Kane's headstrong temperament. Yet, despite the transgression into Xanadu's inner sanctum in which we are privy, Kane's only mortal self-disclosure occurs in his single-word valediction: ""rosebud."" Later, through his associates' excoriations and obsequies, we incrementally learn of the pyrrhic victories of Kane's ego. These present conflicting images of him as a crusading journalist, yet rhetorically stooping to ""Remember the Maine"" artifice; a champion of the working man, yet not approving of unions.",

But when it comes to the bottom line I just didn't see the whole as being anything other than another fairly good film.

And for a film from 1941 it was greatly directed by Orson Welles with the scenes and story being interesting. As it's pretty simple the movie is of the life and times of news paper tycoon and very rich man Charles Kane. Most of the movie is done thru flashback after the death of Charles(AKA ""Rosebud"") and it involves the investigative work of reporters trying to find out about Charles's life from political experiences to scandal like that of an affair with a singer and how all of this caused him to have a fall off.

Orson Welles' passion project, on which he had the coveted 'final cut', could easily pass as much more modern fare thanks to some frenetic, unique camera-work and effective scene transitions. The plot of 'Citizen Kane (1941)' is compelling, told using longer takes that really give the excellent actors room to flex their proverbial muscles, and the flash-back based narrative does a good job of keeping you invested in the life of a man you know already to be dead. Yet, the mystery at the centre of it all, the iconic 'rosebud', comes to a close with a lack of proper resolution. It does shed some light on the motives of the central character and isn't meant to be the main focus of the feature, though.

Anyone who studies cinema history understands that Citizen Kane should always be mentioned as an essential, influential work. You'll never, ever see it remade. No one would dare try to make it better, because they can't. Some call it dated, yet it was made in 1941. Even today, it will knock the pants off most films that are hammered out by the studios and independent companies, alike. ",
571,29 June 2000,robsellke,10, One of the greatest films I've ever seen,"Citizen Kane has received many honors in the past, including the AFI's #1 American film award, which is a great honor.  The camera shots in the movie are unique, and were brand-new techniques at the time of its filming.  The cinematograhpy is beautiful and powerful and the camerawork is fantastic. For example, when Kane (Welles) becomes the rich and powerful mogul that he is in his later life, the camera shoots from under him, to make Kane look taller.  When Kane was having an argument with his second wife, the camera shot from over her, to make her look smaller in his presence, giving Kane an aura of superiority.  The story is sad but beautiful, and the acting is superb.  This is a classic and shouldn't be missed by anyone mature enough to understand it.",
572,30 December 2019,Lejink,9, Kane and Very Able,"What can you do with a monument like Kane? Well, all I think you can do is just walk around it admiringly, time and again, because undoubtedly you'll see or hear something you've missed before which, at least if you're me, will only deepen your appreciation of Welles's breathtaking daring and genius in bringing it to the screen as his debut feature. Just consider that, his first film.",
573,2 January 2023,akshatmahajan,5, Good work for it's time,"I finally watched the movie after hearing so much positive about it from many years. The movie had a simple story, even the execution was normal. There was nothing special in it. The performances by the actors were in the range of good to average. To be honest, I was confused why this movie gets so much praised. Yes, it was a good drama but if you say it was groundbreaking work. No, it was not. Maybe it was for 1940s audience but not for today's audience.",

575,7 October 1998,johnqrs,10, More than just a chilling tale...(The Composition of a Masterpiece),"The genius of this film is often only felt by the audience from the more external understanding of the mere sequence of events that take place. Now, that's an aspect of the film worthy of praise, as Kane *did* win Best Screenplay in 1941, and the script is, indeed extremely tight. (Does anyone else marvel at the line ""New York, Chicago, and Washington, maybe?"" uttered by Jim Kane towards the beginning? You of course realize this maps out Kane's entire life...New York Enquirer, Chicago Opera House, and a failed political career? Not bad, eh?) But the more subtle genius of the film is it's use of triangular construction and frame composition. Oh, my gushing is taking up too much space. But, my god, the use of shadows and angles should be paid attention to! The way the aural ambience of each scene differs and morphs echoes Welles' radio background, and should be paid attention to! He used processed backgrounds for *In-Room* shots, just to pack in the right amount of information, and frame it up how it wanted. He shoots the speakers in shadowed obscurity and has them come into the light right on the key line. The cockatoo that begins the Butler's account of Susan leaving him is purely expressionist film-making! The form cuts that make the film's skewed chronology move along seamlessly! Oh, for god sakes, watch the man work, people. This is how it's done.",
576,7 June 2000,Muttley-4,1, One of the most overrated films of all time,"I went into this film hoping and expecting to find a moving, character led masterpiece.  Unfortunately what I found was a tired, dated film with very little character depth of any description.",
577,26 June 2007,DKosty123,7, Orsen Welles Period Piece,"This is an intelligent film, but it is more of a period piece than it is a classic. My apologies to AFI but as the memories of William Randolph Herst fade, this movie will fade too. That it has lasted this long amazes me. In fact, a poll of college students today would rarely put this in the top 10 films made. The AFI is not composed of college students.",
