0,5 April 2015,BA_Harrison,7, A classy character study of a disturbed individual-but what is the point?,"Insomniac Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) takes a job driving a New York taxi cab, becomes obsessed with beautiful political campaigner Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), who gives him the cold shoulder after he tries to take her to a skin flick on a date. Bickle then becomes obsessed with underage hooker Iris (Jodie Foster), buys lots of guns, and goes trigger happy on her pimp (Harvey Keitel).",/
1,20 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, Ladies and gentlemen: Mr. Robert De Niro!,"Taxi Driver, the classic that made Robert DeNiro Robert DeNiro. It's amazing to see how far this man has come in cinema, some of my friends ask me questions about films and advice, one of my friends had asked if they wanted to see where Bobby got the big notice I usually recommend Taxi Driver, granted he was in The Godfather Part 2 and was incredible, but Taxi Driver made him stand out as a strong lead actor. Taxi Driver is just all together a great film that is absolutely perfection. Martin Scorcesse who also was just really starting out made this movie that brought us back to the film noir genre. He made this great classic and I don't even think he realized how much it would stand against the test of time, to this day we still know this film and even if you don't know it, you know the infamous speech ""You talking' to me?"". This is a film about isolation, loneliness, and self destruction at it's worst.",r
2,9 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, Still has the power to shock...,"Not only one of Scorsese's best films, but one of the best of the 70s. It is very hard hitting, dark and still has the resonance and power to shock. The cinematography is measured and chilly, yet very atmospheric, while Bernard Hermann's swansong score is superb, yet more proof at how amazing a composer he was. The story is unsettling but wonderfully told, and the script is brilliantly written. Scorcese also directs impeccably, while the acting is just excellent. Robert DeNiro gives one of his best performances, the whole film is worth watching just for his performance, that's how good it is, but that's not to dismiss Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel and Cybill Sheppard in the supporting cast for they are just as good while Scorsese's own cameo is genuinely frightening. There you have it, another one of Scorsese's best with a brilliant atmosphere and mesmerising central performance. 10/10 Bethany Cox",e
3,17 November 1999,andrew7,10," Disturbing, powerful, relevant, important",A towering classic of American cinematic power.  Martin Scorsese teams up with one of the most intense actors of that time to create a masterpiece of urban alienation.  Paul Schrader's magnificent script paints a portrait of loneliness in the largest city of the world.  Travis never once enters into a meaningful relationship with any character anywhere in the film.  He is the most hopelessly alone person I've ever encountered on film.,v

6,9 November 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, An incredibly dark thriller with an exceptional central performance,"Quite rightly regarded as one of the best films of all time, TAXI DRIVER is without a doubt compelling viewing. What the film lacks in plot it makes up for in characterisation: De Niro is with us from the start, we follow on his journey as he slides into extreme violence and becomes a vigilante. Although it's obvious that this man is disturbed from the very beginning - a man who considers pornography to be ""just another movie"", who is always at breaking point. You can't really blame him though. After all, his empty life is forever surrounded by people who don't deserve to live, who don't deserve to populate this planet, and nobody is doing anything about it. It's up to Bickle to do the dirty work himself. He is the new rain coming down on the streets to clear away all the garbage.",w

8,21 February 2021,PyroSikTh,7, Not Quite Sure on the Acclaim,"Taxi Driver, if you weren't aware, follows a New York City taxi driver called Travis Bickle as he descends into a state of masculine madness. Along the way he courts Betsy, a member of a local campaign for a presidential candidate, continuously runs into Iris, an underage prostitute, sits on the outside of his cab-driving colleagues, and has his worldview shaped by the men and women he ferries all over the city. Spoilers; it's not a very healthy worldview at all. Taking on the night shift leaves him with a darkened view of a world run by pimps, junkies, thieves, and murderers. He suffers crippling insomnia which leaves him either alone in his apartment fantasising about the man he wants to be, or huddled in a porno theatre, the irony completely lost on him.",r
9,13 February 2006,francheval,10, Diary of a madman,"The script of ""Taxi Driver"" is built like a diary, the diary of a very ordinary guy who gets hired as a night taxi driver back from Vietnam, because he can't sleep at night. A very ordinary guy who tries to break his isolation, but can't, while violence accumulates inside him. One of those unnoticed people with dark things on their mind, one of those who break up the news one day with some extraordinary outburst of rage, to fall back immediately into anonymity.",w
10,25 June 2008,DaveDiggler,9, A Descent Into Madness,"""Taxi Driver"" starts off with a beautiful and perfectly fitting score from composer, Bernard Hermann, as we see the blurred city of New York as the fast paced lights from cars and signs are distorted and put into slow motion. ""Taxi Driver"" is one of Martin Scorsese' finest achievements as he teams up with Robert De Niro. Travis Bickle (De Niro) is the title character. The acting as a whole is exceptional. Harvey Keitel has an extremely small part as a pimp named Sport, and he brings a forgettable character to center stage. Keitel is so good in this you wish you would get to see more from his character. Jodie Foster plays the prostitute under Sports rule. Iris, is 12 years old, and for a 14 year old actress (at the time), Foster deals with some heavy and extremely adult material, and she handles it incredibly well. Keitel and Foster have a scene together where Sport holds her and slowly dances with her as he whispers into her ear about how lucky he is to have a woman like her. It's an utterly repulsive scene. The look on his face mixed with the calm and safe look on the face of Iris, is pretty disgusting. It's extremely well acted even though it's a pretty quick and minor scene. In this one scene we see the type of control Sport has over the young, impressionable child that he abuses and takes advantage of. These are the kinds of things that set Travis Bickle off. The film is a classic that dissects the fallout of one mans loneliness and his thirst for acceptance, recognition and notice. The editing is very good, the direction is great, but it's carried by a magnificent script from Paul Schrader and a great lead performance. This probably stands as De Niro's second best work to ""Raging Bull,"" and among the finest acting performances of all time. ",2
11,2 November 1999,TomC-5,10, Scorsese's dark masterpiece of urban alienation,"Despite what some might see as limited by technical flaws and/or as an overly simplistic plot, Taxi Driver deserves its critical reputation as a cinematic masterpiece. Some 23 years later, the existential plight of Travis Bickle, ""God's lonely man,"" continues to pack a hard emotional punch. In fact, it's hard to know where to begin when praising the elements of this film - such elements as the dark location shots of a (now gone) seedy Times Square, the cinema verite settings of the cabbies and campaign workers, the magnificent Bernard Hermann score, Paul Schrader's fine script, the memorable performances of Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel, and Peter Boyle all must be mentioned. However, the brilliance of this film is primarily a result of the brilliance of De Niro and Scorsese, one of the greatest actor-director teams in movie history. This is an unforgettable film and rates a 10 out of 10, in my estimation.",5
12,3 April 2006,ccthemovieman-1,10, An Unforgettable Movie and Lead Character,"""Travis Bickle"" has to be one of the most fascinating characters ever put on film, and this has to still rank as one of the best post-film noir era ""noirs"" ever made.",6
13,8 August 2020,scorkery-762-655265,9, One scene that has stuck with me for 44 yrs...,"Just a little side note, an observation from one scene that has stayed with me since I first saw this movie nearly 45 yrs ago. It's the middle of the movie when Travis is going thru his metamorphosis from simple-minded taxi driver to full on psychotic protector/vigilante; the iconic ""You talkin' to me?"" scene. He's in his drab apartment watching American Bandstand and as Jackson Browne's achingly beautiful song ""Late For The Sky"" plays, the AB dancers sway slowly to the beat, holding each other close...teenagers in love having a tender moment. Travis' face shows how desperately lonely he is; how he's probably never even danced with a girl in his life, much less had a normal relationship with one and how he needs to make a love connection with the Jodie Foster or Cybill Shepherd characters in a most sensational way. To me, a crystallizing scene that moves the story along to its' inevitable shocking end.",3

His eyes survey the streets with all the malice and passion of a burning fire, his large pupils an open doorway leading into his soul.

Travis is a lonely uneducated man that spends his leisure time watching porn films in the theaters. When Travis sees the gorgeous Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) working as a volunteer in the campaign for president of Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris), he has a crush on her. He invites Betsy to drink coffee with him and later he dates her. However he takes her to see a porn Swedish movie and she feels offended and leaves him.

Travis also buys several weapons from a dealer and practices shooting. When he meets Iris again, he is resolute to help her. Will Travis succeed in his intent?",1
17,22 February 2007,Hitchcoc,9, Gut Wrenching,"It's interesting to read the reviews by people who really disliked this film. Can we dislike virtually every character in a movie and yet keep watching it, even respect it? I don't have a definitive answer to this, but I was captivated by this film. I get this feeling every time I see films that glorify organized crime. DeNiro's performance so surpasses any doubt as to the content of this film that I couldn't take my eyes off him. Contrary to the critics, his every expression reveals his skill as an actor. While his motivations are confusing, they are his motives. He is an unbalanced war survivor who can't tolerate the cesspool the world has become. I mean, ""What did I fight for?"" His social skills are wasted. When he goes on the date, it's one of the most uncomfortable moments I've ever spent in a theater. The efforts to save a small part of his world is met with disdain and resistance. So he flips out and decides to clean it up himself. He is suspicious of politicians and authority figures. He becomes his own man and takes matters into his own hands. The key thing is that he is true to himself and even though he is a frightening figure, he gets his way. I guess most think he should have been killed. That's not a valid criticism. See this, but be prepared to keep changing positions in your seat.",/
18,3 August 2021,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,10, I think it is one of the indispensables of a cinema lover,"Travis is one of the main characters that should be underlined in the world of cinema, and of course the camera that revolves around Travis is like a reflection camera placed in Travis' brain. There is more to the audience than acting. To be seen as a legendary man who has synthesized psychological depression with his loneliness, like a bomb ready to explode at any moment he lives, but at the same time as a simple and ordinary taxi driver inversely proportional to this. Travis is one of the examples that life puts in the wrong corner. The city has such a treatment that they have so engraved the dark city in the movie that when we think of scenes from the movie, it is a sky where the exhausts of old cars and cigarette smoke blend together, dirty streets and laughter. Travis is a person's soul to be separated from himself and become lonely. Psychology that will allow a man with a pure and pure heart to come across the wrong hours of life, to feel the ticking of the clock as his own loneliness, to get one step closer to the explosion as time goes by, and to take on a psychopathic identity as time goes on. Trying to eliminate loneliness with weapons and putting the monotonous city into different tunes has now been left to the subconscious of this man. Besides its script, it is a film that created a visual feast in my memory with its strong psychology and huge camera angles. Robert De Niro and his charisma and his charisma combined like the paralyzed stray cats of the American streets, revealing the story of a journey to anarchy. Think of Travis in the dark streets of your heart before you withdraw into your own self and think for a long time. I think it is one of the indispensables of a cinema lover.",?
19,1 March 2021,tilismconcepts,10, A film open to interpretations even after decades,"What I take from this movie might be completely different than what others do. This is one of those masterpieces which appeal to each individual in a completely different way. While most people I know believe that de Niro's character actually died and the end was his imagination before he died, and Scorsese explained it was all literal, the common ground I find and I think that makes more sense is that most of the movie was his imagination except for its end. I think it was in his imagination he fell in love and tried to help Jodie Foster, while in reality he remained an ordinary Taxi Driver. In the last scene however he actually meets the girl he imagined he was in love with, and he only realizes that after she gets out of his cab. He doesn't charge her because for some strange reason which even he doesn't understand he likes her. And just as he moves away from her he realizes this was the girl he imagined. Before she leaves, she calls him by his name and most viewers would think she knows him from the past, but I think she doesn't. She just reads his name written close to the meter on his taxi. Just like the senator figured out his name.
What the film in my opinion is actually trying to tell is how a taxi driver dreams of being a hero according to his own understanding of his surroundings.",r
20,21 August 2002,Ghenghy,2, Still don't get it?,"Just forced myself to watch this film again for the third time thinking maybe I had some Natural Born Killer prejudice against this movie, which I kicked, but after painfully sitting through this thing again for the last time all I can say is I'm tired, depressed, and befuddled at the high praise for this darkly disturbing film. Or maybe that's the alure for some people. If you look at the votes for this thing people either love it or hate it. I'm mostly indifferent. The problem I have with Taxi Driver is that there are too many unanswered questions about Travis' background, experience in the Marine Corp, etc. We know he was discharged while Vietnam was winding down but we don't have a clue what the source of his ""instability"" is! Are we to assume that he had suffered some sort of trauma during the war...did he ever see any action...was he really discharged because of his instability? In fact, the guy seems perfectly normal other than a slightly obsessive compulsive complex which 70% of society is sporting, and he can't sleep. Awwww, poor thing. Well neither can I, and a lot of people can't sleep at nights. Does that alone make Travis a candidate for the nuthouse? Nope. The truth is, we don't know what his problems stem from and that is a major problem with this movie. His descent is so spontaneous when Betsy reacts about being dragged to an adult film, and he just snaps, we don't know why?!? (spoiler alert) Next thing you know the guy is buying guns like there's no tomorrow to feed his all-of-a-sudden John Wayne complex that springs from a source we can't as an audience connect with. Good performances overall don't salvage the many holes that litter the canvas of this highly overrated drama. And somebody please explain to me all this talk about Travis searching for ""redemption"", from WHAT>?>? Jeez! The final shootout is a little too reminiscent of the Wild Bunch where spurting blood and bad editing wooed critics all around. Amazing. 6/10",e
21,11 October 2007,willandthomas-picturehou,10, A Shattering Tale In First Person Singular,"The impact that ""Taxi Driver"" had in its day hasn't diminished, on the contrary, it has acquired a relevance of Shakesperean proportions. Travis's loneliness is a hyper representation of the same loneliness most humans have experienced at different times in different measures. It is always associated with a nightmare and Martin Scorsese delivers it like a nightmare. Travis, possessed by Robert De Niro at the zenith of his powers, cruises in his taxi enveloped in Bernard Herrman and we, well, we're the passengers and everything looks terrifying and familiar at the same time. Paul Schrader sensational screenplay comes to life with the jolting force of a rude awakening. Like it happens, more often than not, with masterpieces, it signed in a rather direct way the lives of the ones who live it in a movie theater and the ones who made it. Scorsese being the giant that he is, survived it and will continue startling us I'm sure but I also bet that for years everything he did was compared to this movie. De Niro and his ""You looking at me"" became such an iconic phrase that even he himself ended up impersonating it. Jodie Foster awoke the insane devotion of a real life would be killer and New York, the greatest city in the world was shown with its underbelly up. A work of art, a superlative reminder of what film could actually give us and very rarely does.",f
22,16 April 2011,classicsoncall,9," ""Here is a man who would not take it anymore"".","In a calculated exercise, I watched ""Raging Bull"" and ""Taxi Driver"" back to back today. Two classics, and two films generally recognized by critics and fans to be among the best of all time. Personally, I think Bull was the better showcase for both De Niro and director Scorsese as the four years between films allowed both to improve on their respective crafts. In terms of favorites, that might be a moot point, as both are darkly disturbing and violent films, with main characters that aren't particularly honorable, much less likable.",_

35,17 November 2012,ironhorse_iv,8, Let's taxi to the Dark Side of Life,"Essential film to watch. Director Martin Scorsese, and Screenwriter Paul Schrader shows a life full of private fear, emptiness, and loneliness in 'Taxi Driver'. Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) is that Taxi Driver, a Vietnam Vet whom seldom speak whom drifts in and out of 1970's New York City wicked night life. He witness a lot of wrongs and faults in civilization by how the people act around him. Robert De Niro character is similar to Don Quixote and Dostoyevsky's ''Idiot''. He is a good man trapped in an evil and sick world ,the difference with Travis is that he gets through it by becoming even more vicious than the world of slime, he inhabits whereas Quixote remains delusional and dies and the 'idiot' goes insane. He slowly growing tired of it, and losing hope and looks for a way out. These supporting cast ''way out' are Betsie and Iris. (Cybil Sheppard & Jolie Foster). Both being symbolic of Travis having a madonna/whore complex somewhat. Betsie is a campaign volunteer for Sentaor Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris) who is running for President.. Iris is a 12-year-old child prostitute who is attempting to escape her pimp Matthew 'Sport' (Harvey Keitel) who he becomes obsessed with helping her return to her parents' home, sending her money to do so and a letter in which he states he will soon be dead. Disgusted by the street crime, politics and prostitution that he witnesses through the city, Travis finds a focus for his frustration and begins a program of intense physical training and shaving his head into a mohawk as he become a weapon for violence. The scary underlying concept in the movie that many overlook is that Travis Bickle is the manifestation of America of the 1970s. A confused society recovering from the failed war in Vietnam, from poverty of the working-class, from racism towards blacks, from drug addiction, and from mental illness. Bickle has adopted the confused mix of the military values of militancy, honor, and chivalry (his initial modest courtship of Betsy) with sexual perversion, racism, and disillusionment with society. The ending of the movie can be interpreted in many ways. Was Travis a hero or villain? Did he die or live? Some people might not like the movie, due to the sexual and racist undertones in the film, the violence, and the cursing. Taxi Driver is and will always be a disturbing film, however it's thought provoking and now there is a lot of depth to be seen in this very critical film. It's an experiment, NOT entertainment, only vaguely art. It presents no solutions, promotes despair, and really is a glorification of violence, and of the filmmakers own self conscious congratulations of himself on his own daring. It's a experiment of the mind.",

It is beloved by many, adored by most viewers but to me, it's just good. I've stated this before during some of my reviews but I'm just not a fan of shootouts, especially when they display Terminator-like stamina and endurance when getting shot or injured in some way. It's like watching an anime character getting beaten to the grown and seeing them regain all their power again in a blink of an eye just to save the day. Of all those that I didn't like though, I'd say this is the best. Mostly because of the aftermath where Travis did the finger gun motion at his skull upon the arrival of policemen. He did it in a crazy, a bit surreal even, fashion that ended up being the most memorable scene in the movie.",

Born from Schrader's own sense of isolation at a particularly unpleasant low point in his life, this tale of a loner cabbie is one of a man lost in a sea of people, unable to make any kind of connection, and left to his own delusions that take him into dangerous places.

Certainly one of the things that stands out the most is the New York setting, the city is practically a character in the film, the soundtrack is also great, the direction of Scorsese needs no comments, and the feature has what is in my opinion the best character study in the history of cinema.

The early shots, especially, the night scenes with neon reflected in puddles and viewed through the rear view mirror of the taxi, take the breath away. There is a beauty in the accumulated sleaze and it is ironic that DeNiro should speak of it with such disgust. But speak of it so well does he that we are caught between the two realities. That this seeming nobody could charm the sparkling Cybill Shepherd is at once unbelievable and believable. DeNiro plays these early scenes so well. I realise the writing is near perfect but even so it is stretching a point the ease with which his seduction proceeds and although we are on his side, we can barely believe our/his luck. As the film proceeds and we begin to realise just how mixed up or even psychotic the guy is we still cannot shake a liking for the character. All of this is helped enormously by the incredibly beautiful score by Bernard Herrmann and there are times when the visuals, the music and DeNiro's monologues combine to achieve sheer perfect cinema.",

64,1 November 2020,MovieCinematography,10, One of my favorite Movies!,"Taxi Driver is a Neo-Noir crime drama, directed by Martin Scorsese. It is starring Robert de Niro and Jodie Foster and is about a mentally unstable taxi driver who feels a need for violent action and wants to help a young woman to escape from her bad situation. It takes place in late 70s New York when the city wasn't the nice clean city as we know it today but it was a city full of criminals and unemployment. Taxi Driver is a really interesting character study and although it's slow paced it doesn't feel boring. Although the first two acts are slow paced, the final act is very thrilling and brutal. The ending makes you keep guessing. The Soundtrack composed by Bernard Herrmann captures that feeling of 70s New York very well. It has very beautiful cinematography which is very dark and rainy the whole time which sets a great mood for the film. The best thing about this movie is by far Robert de Niro's performance. He does a very good job at portraying this mentally unstable veteran, who can't fit in the society anymore. Taxi Driver has very long dialogues that are well-written.",

All of the minor characters are also interesting; most of them are either a psycho, racist or just plain despicable, in some way or another. The transformation that DeNiro's character undertakes, from being a nice, gentle guy, to being a gun-toting self-help psycho, is amazing.

More than anything else, it's the tale of a man who feels disconnected from society at large, a society which he has come to regard as filthy and corrupt and in need of a cleanup. That doesn't change the fact, however, that the man in question is mentally unbalanced and would likely never completely fit in. Therefore, an all night cab driver would seem to be the perfect occupation for him, and while on the job he meets the various flotsam and jetsam that make up the NYC population.

I've seen it twice, read stuff about it, got a lecture on it, and I still can't see how anybody could call this movie a masterpiece. So Scorsese shows us a shot of an empty hall while DeNiro is talking on the phone. So what? And is the fact that he constantly makes us aware that we're watching a movie a sign of Scorsese's greatness? Even when it doesn't serve any real purpose??? I particularly dislike the ending - the lack of comment on the violence and the way Travis turns out to be a hero. Is this a critique of violence or a celebration of it?

81,9 July 2004,InjunNose,10, A difficult film to review...,"What can you say about ""Taxi Driver"" that hasn't been said already? It's phenomenal. I'm not a fan of Scorsese's other directorial efforts, really--nor am I a big DeNiro fan--but everything about this film is absolutely, unquestionably RIGHT. So many people seem to be confused when they watch this movie: they either root for Travis Bickle when he finally loses his marbles, or they feel that ""Taxi Driver"" tries to justify racism and misogyny. I don't think there's any need to go to such extremes. Yes, there are elements of racism and misogyny here, but the film doesn't promote those attitudes. And as for Travis being the nominal ""hero"" of the film, I don't believe that this was Paul Schrader's intention, either. There ARE no heroes; ultimately, this is just the very grim story of a marginalized man who loses what little control he had to begin with. This is why ""Taxi Driver"" appeals to people, I believe, but it's also why the film is routinely misinterpreted. As Schrader has said, this is a film about alienation. ""Taxi Driver"" tells an interesting, engaging human story and that's what makes it great--not the social commentary, or what's viewed as such.",
82,3 April 2021,Coffee_in_the_Clink,9, Travis Bickle is in all of us,"Much has been said about Robert de Niro's powerful performance as Travis Bickle in Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"", about an unhinged taxi driver who works the night shift in New York and grows increasingly disillusioned at the scum and sights he sees on a nightly basis. There is something about the scene where he describes how he must ""wash the cum"" off the backseat of his vehicle every morning once he returns it to the depot to clock out. We get into his head and his world, and can't help but condone his actions by the end, even if we don't want to and feel like we need a shower once the end credits roll. De Niro is superb, but the best performance in this film comes from Jodie Foster. She is superb here, and the fact that she was only 14 years old is hard to imagine. The cinematographer is impressive and Scorcese gives a chilling cameo as a customer in the back of Bickle's taxi who plots to murder his wife and her lover. ""Taxi Driver"" is a slow burn of a film that you watch for the character study, the view into a seedy underworld unfolding in civilised society once the sun sets, and the trials and tribulations of people like Travis and Iris who try to survive amongst the human debris.",

89,7 October 2021,AngelHonesty,4, Very slow Paced and Down right Depressing,"Let's be brutally honest here. The film is extremely slow paced with next to no storyline making it dreary and boring. I know it's one of the great films for it's time and its not that it was acted poorly, but instead the message being portrayed in the movie was very depressing. The main message in the film is seeing the mental state of a cab driver, while we watch him live his daily life and how those condition can make a man go to the extremes. He's depressed... He has a crappy job... His social skills are terrible... I understand setting a scene and a mood for a character, but the entire film was about setting the scene and the mood. It was only at the very end that the movie picked up when the character finally came to the end of himself and made a decision to do something about it. Perhaps the deep meaning of the film is powerful and well portrayed, but its depressing to watch. The one thing that did catch my attention in the movie was Robert De Niro. He's so young in this movie and he acts a little different than his usual roles, it was nice seeing a different side of his acting and as always he never disappoints. I wish there would have been more scenes with Jodie Foster, as this was the movie that helped bring her into the publics eye with her talented acting at such a young age. I was surprised how little of a role she had in the film as they brought her in during the end of the movie, but she definitely doesn't disappoint with her acting skills.",
90,15 April 1999,coop-16,10," Surreal, searing, descent into hell.","A Catholic priest named Joseph Pirrone, who is an old friend and former teacher of Scorsese, complained that the biggest problem with Marty's movies was ""too much easter Friday, not enough Easter Sunday."" Indeed, with the obvious exception of Alice Hyatt , and the possible exceptions of Newland Archer and fast Eddie Felsom,very few of Marty's characters experience real happiness, or earthly salvation.The most  that most them do is to survive ( Though we are to assume that one of them IS resurrected). So far, most of Scorsese's film have been tours of the circles of Dante's hell. ( He has said that this will change in the future.) One of his most harrowing tours of the Inferno is Taxi Driver.I first saw this horrific masterpiece on the big screen ten years ago.It remains burnt into my memory. Let me just note two things about the film that seem to have escaped the attention of many viewers. The first is how much black, sardonic humor there is . Albert Brooks and Peter Boyle are genuinely AMUSING. The second is how romantic it is. I dont mean romantic in in the ""Harlequin romance"" sense, I mean ""romantic' in the Hawthorne/Melville sense. Like Ahab or Ethan Brand, Travis Bickle is a dark protagonist in a tale that  SEEMS realistic, but which is actually  surrealistic, fantastic, and just plain strange. Like them is he is on a dark, obsessive, demonic quest. After all, how much of what we see is really there, and how much  exists only in Travis' Fantasy world? in short, there is more here than meets the eye--much more. Perhaps David Lynch had a point when he said "" Kubrick is the coolest ( director),and Marty is next door.""

91,28 November 2010,sddavis63,5, You Spend Too Much Of Your Time Waiting,"There's more than a few things about this film that are worth liking - and liking very much. Two names stand out in particular as I assess the strong points in this: Robert Deniro and Martin Scorsese. Deniro was excellent as Travis Bickle, a Vietnam vet who ends up driving a taxi because he can't sleep at night. This isn't your typical ""Vietnam vet goes crazy"" movie. Aside from the fact that Travis identifies himself as a former Marine when he applies for the taxi driver's position nothing connects him to Vietnam. We assume that as an ex-Marine, discharged in 1973, he must have seen action in Vietnam, but the war there plays no role of significance in this. Essentially the entire movie is about Bickle's slow descent. He starts out as a relatively normal character, a guy who decides to make some money off his insomnia. Why not? Deniro was quite convincing as Bickle, depicting a decline that was believably gradual. Part of the credit, of course, has to go to director Scorsese as well. His direction helped build the character. He also managed to paint a totally convincing picture of a New York City in complete decay - a grimy city filled with pimps and prostitutes and drug pushers, with little apparently to redeem it. It's not a very flattering portrayal of the city that never sleeps, but it does paint a picture of what happens while the city isn't sleeping! So credit to both Deniro and Scorsese for doing effectively what they set out to do - which was painting a convincing and realistic picture.",

Martin Scorsese's film is indeed quite good, but it's also flawed, murky and confusing, talky in the wrong places, and features such an over-hyped performance by young Jodie Foster as a pre-teen prostitute that I imagine most viewers will be let down by what amounts to an extremely minor role. Robert De Niro's work is the centerpiece of the picture, playing haunted New York City cabbie Travis Bickle, a man so consumed by the evil on the streets that he eventually stoops to its level. Bickle is a human time bomb; he's ready to explode, and it wouldn't matter where he was or what he was doing. The movie doesn't make any apologies for Bickle, but I didn't buy some of the reasons for his actions (it's briefly alluded to that Travis wants to ""save"" Foster from her sordid existence, but one gets the feeling he just wants to shoot at somebody...anybody). I've seen better movies about people-as-targets, the City As Hell and urban alienation, but I think the reason why so many people remember ""Taxi Driver"" and keep returning to it is Scorsese's style. The filmmaker has an unflinching, fearless ability to take on the most neurotic of outcasts while wedging his camera into the most provocative or squalid of surroundings. His picture moves at a staccato rhythm--and it has too much chatter--yet the seamy, sticky ambiance is so tangible you can practically feel it on your fingertips. Cybill Shepherd does excellent work as a beautiful woman stumping for a senator's presidential bid who comes into contact with Bickle; Harvey Keitel is oddly-placed but compelling as a smug, self-assured pimp; and Oscar-nominated Foster, while just a bit self-conscious, does well with a sketchy role. De Niro, who was also nominated for an Oscar, is so adept at these kind of misfit characterizations that we're ready to fill in the blanks left behind by screenwriter Paul Schrader. We don't really learn much about Travis Bickle--deliberately, one assumes--yet De Niro and Scorsese draw us into his dark world. It's a fascinating portrait. *** from ****",

For, without this film, many modern films that we know and love today may have been very different, if exist at all. The movie has one feeling the natural unease that comes with watching those around them be corrupted and destroyed while at the same time one of them is trying to soothe you and tell you that everything is going to be all right.

104,20 April 1999,bnm81510,9," The only flaw is the ""epilogue"".","Scorcese must have known his Dostoyevsky well, and not strictly in the positive sense. In a decision of startling audacity for the seventies, he created a modern-day Rascolnikov as an emotionally scarred Vietnam vet, plunging into greater madness at the very core of the world's rotten heart: New York City. One who develops his own agenda of redemption, and eventually becomes a near automaton set to eliminate all that he hates at any cost. De Niro, as Travis Bickle is no more a mere promising talent, but a true revelation, a paragon of male urban despair, a picture-perfect definition of a walking timebomb. His metamorphosis into a killing machine is incredibly vivid and tense, a performance that glues to the screen and transcends all boundaries, making you revel in its very depravity and rejoice in the sublimely staged climax through which De Niro almost sleepwalks, blinded by uncontrollable obsession. This is interactive cinema: the kind that takes the viewers' senses into full custody and does not release them until the very last moment. Jodie Foster, unlike Dostoyevsky's fallen saints, plays her part with bitter cynicism combined with hidden vulnerability, a far more appropriate behavior for a teenage prostitute. Bernard Hermann, the man who brought you the ""Psycho"" soundtrack creates an equally memorable score. Yes, ""Taxi Driver"" would have been an all-around 10, if not for the final three minutes. Just as ""Crime and Punishment""'s tacked-on epilogue of dubious ""salvation"" spoils the overall experience, so does the film's, which should have ended right at the end of that overhead crane shot of authorities and bystanders arriving on the scene of Travis' ultimate crime.",

This movie, of course as you might as well have seen is pretty high ranked in the IMDB top 250 and is also acclaimed by many critics, but I can tell you, this movie sucks. Mainly because of the good grades this movie got by critics and also from critics and I like De Niro and some of Scorsese's films (most of all GoodFellas) I taped this movie when it was on TV a few weeks ago. I started this movie thinking it would some kind of average or just above average movie, because I tend to not like some of those movies that are generally being enjoyed, like The Godfather, I think, even rated very high all the time it deserves a 6 or maybe 7 out of ten. But now getting to the movie, in my TV guide it got 4 out of four and the plot was outlined as, whacko Taxi Driver's life changes dramatically after a meet with someone. After the film starts you get some kind of average, what happpens in the life of a Taxi Diver, then he goes nuts (after 1 hour) and you think, YES, now it'll really begin. He buys guns and eventually even shoots a guy. And then evantually as before ... nothing, it goes on for another 20 minutes or 30 like that and then I just couldn't stand it no more. Nothing happens, this is JUST an average story about the pretty normal life of a man, that changes at a moment(I don't know  if this happened I didn't finish the movie), with average performances from the cast, without any thrills, chills, laughs, brutal scenes, touching moments and so on.......... Seen his good grade on IMDB makes me wanna give it a 1 out of 10, but I'll be nice, I'll give it what it deserves, a 3 out of 10.",

The ""romance"" between DeNiro's character and Cybill Shepard's sleek young professional is improbable to the nth degree, and even a clueless shmuck like DeNiro wouldn't be stupid enough to take a high class girl to a porno film on his first date. I suppose the viewer is expected to infer the reasons for every other unexplained development in the movie: DeNiro's purchase of an arsenal of weapons larger than some U.S. units are equipped with in Iraq, his sudden urge to rescue Jodie Foster's child prostitute, the approach to the candidate for president (couldn't get close enough to kill him, I guess), the final scene driving Cybill Shepard's character in his taxi (a dream sequence while he's still in the hospital or after he's died?), the letter of thanks from the parents of the child prostitute (also a dream sequence? also after he's died?).

118,22 July 2019,batmanorgiants,10, Probably the most uncomfortable I've ever felt watching a movie.,"Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is famous and infamous for a lot of reasons. Questions over whether or not Travis is a lunatic, an intelligent cunning man who knows what he wants, or a depressed man trying to gain revenge on a world that doesn't like him and which he doesn't like in return ( I personally believe it's the third one) or the countless theories that the ending is a dream sequence/ a hint he's a violent ticking time bomb that will strike again as a hero or the villain he originally attended to go out as. But what stuck me the most about the movie was his characteristics. You see, when I first started watching the movie, I got a sense that the intelligent, observant, insightful man Travis was trying to show to world, and by extension the audience was full of crud. Why? Because I act and lash out the same way as he does. The projection he lays out to Betsy explaining to her that ""all the telephones in her office doesn't hide her loneliness"" , his uncalled for criticism of her coworker, his obsession to Betsy bleeding into his lust to kill the senator. These are all things I can see myself doing I've tried to convince myself and other romantic interests of how sophisticated I am when in reality I don't stand by anything. Notice how Travis has no interest in politics but yet tries to act as if he has any interest in what his significant other is passionate about in order to impress her. But when she asks him basic questions of his policies, his mask cracks. He has the charisma to breeze over the questions but that still doesn't excuse the fact that this is a man without a true identity. All he knows is hate. Hatred for how Betsy treated him, hatred for his fellow taxi drivers acceptance of the destructiveness that happens around them, hatred towards Sports manipulation of Iris. All he wants to do is push his pain and hatred to other people. This is the only reason he planned to kill the senator. He just wanted Betsy to feel what he was feeling. He's no hero: everything he did was selfish and it was for himself. He never wanted to be seen as anything or condemned/ praised for his actions. He just wanted to cause misery and die. His ""saving"" of Iris wasn't even wanted by her: he only did it so he can feel accomplished in completing a mission that will, in his mind, will lead him to die from the gangsters or through suicide. He fails and he's left to suffer again. It's almost as if the film is warning me over my self destructive behavior. My treatment of women is similar to that of Travis albeit a lot less violent and extreme. However the consequences can still be as dire. Loneliness, suffering, and self hatred manifested in a lust to cause others the same pain. I am grateful of how Robert was able to portray a depressed and isolated man in a such a believable and terrifying manner. Everything from his snide tone to his devilish smirk leads to one of the greatest performances I have ever had the privilege of watching. I absolutely detest and hate all of the characters in the movie, especially Travis, but to me that's only because of how personal this story feels to me. It surely is a masterpiece of a movie and I highly recommend watching it. 10/10",

I didn't really understand why Travis would care so much about Iris, maybe he's had rough experiences as a child, or relatives? Some exposition should have been included to why Travis felt such an urge to save Iris, plus she should have been introduced way earlier in the story.

You have to agree with Bickles assertions of the scum of the city. Bickle is a Vietnam marine veteran who gets a night time job driving a cab because he has insomnia. Bickle is mentally unstable and we see him descend into a crescendo of violence towards the end of the film. The film stars De Niro, Cybil Shepherd (Moonlighting with Bruce Willis), a prostitute Jodie Foster, pimp Harvey Keitel.... The score is acclaimed. The composer Bernard Herrmann scored several Alfred Hitchcock hits. The film is directed by Martin Scorcese. The partnership of Scorcese and De Niro became a regular partnership. I still felt let down by the film despite its legendary status amongst many cinephiles.",
145,30 June 2019,Horst_In_Translation,6, From zero to hero,"""Taxi Driver"" is an American movie from 1976, so this one is already over 40 years old now and it runs for slightly under 2 hours. The director is Martin Scorsese and lead actor is Robert De Niro and if you take a look at how big these two have been for decades now, it is very telling that this film here is still a contender for career-best for both of them. De Niro also scored a lead actor Oscar nomination and the film managed to get in for Best Picture as well while eventually not winning any of its 4 nominations. The script writer was Paul Schrader here and this was his only Academy Award nomination, but he is still active today and perhaps was not too far away from his second with his recent work on Ethan Hawke's First Reformed. Anyway, back to this one here. It is the story of a man who cannot sleep at night and to do something useful for once, he decides to start working as a taxi driver, a profession in which he gets in contact with all kinds of absurd characters, most of them just as bizarre as himself. And at the same time, he is in a position when he is basically just their servant, barely interacting with them and most are glad it is this way like the rich guy with the Black prostitute in the backseat. Or the guy who pulls out Foster's character early on. Yep that is true Jodie Foster is in this film too. She already was a quite experienced actress back then despite her age of 14 or so and I quite like her. Still I must say the Oscar nomination was a bit much if we take a closer look at the performance. Compared to other all-time great young age (female) performances that managed such a nomination like Hailee Steinfeld for example, she was not too outstanding and I am somewhat glad she did not win. I think I even read she was considered a frontrunner, or at least second. We will never know. But she cannot complain anyway with how her career developed since then. 2 Oscar wins, a successful filmmaker as well. I like it. She is always pretty likable in my opinion and I am glad her career got a nice boost through that movie here.",
146,4 October 2008,cknob-1,7, Very good but flawed,"Great atmosphere and remarkable performances from DeNiro, Foster and even Albert Brooks but this film is sloppy with too many loose ends. Never really explained or expanded upon is the underlying friction between Travis and African Americans in the film...his suspicious, trance-like staredowns with black characters are never developed. The ending is completely out of place and unbelievable...Travis initiated the shootings...he never would have been hailed as a vigilante hero and in the real world would have been tried for murder. Deeply disturbed protagonist gets the girl in the end???? Come on. What's that all about. Also never fully explained is why does Palentine become the target of his lonely obsession with making a mark in this world? Travis had always expressed the desire to clean up the scum...and I understand the symbolic linking of a pimp with a politician, but the association is sloppy in the film because Travis always admired Palantine even after his disaster date with Betsy. There was never a turning point or event for him where the candidate became the target of his social dissatisfaction. And then there's the subject of Travis' hair. I know it seems petty but it was very distracting seeing scenes that were obviously shot as soon as the shaved headed DeNiro's hair grew in barely enough to pass for continuity with the earlier scenes.",

Now Taxi Driver is absolutely the definition of an instant classic. This film, about a loner with borderline homicidal tendencies, was well-received upon release and to this day, the movie holds up incredibly strong. There are many themes that can be applied to the film which we will get more into later, so this film is one of those rare ones that will challenge you to think; to make your own personal opinions about what is occurring on screen. Paul Schrader's screenplay is well-written and his words are easily brought onto screen with such effectiveness.

Hinckley attempted to assassinate President Ronald Reagan, in 1981, due to his own obsession with actress Jodie Foster. The film has been deconstructed and reconstructed (see references to Death Wish and The Searchers) according to prevailing political and artistic whims more than several times, and matters have been further complicated by the many claims of the film's protagonists, from screenwriter Paul Schrader (is there a better example of a filmic one hit wonder?), to director Scorsese, to star Robert De Niro, the claims and counterclaims about the film have devolved into legendry.",

Because of the creative freedom given to filmmakers in Hollywood like never before, the world began to witness gems from the up and coming talents all around, such as Coppola, Spielberg, de Palma, Bogdanovich, Lucas, Friedkin and many more. One notable filmmaker who really made it big with a knock out psychological drama during this time was Martin Scorsese.

161,10 January 2023,tkdlifemagazine,8, Taxi Driver is as Relevant as The Day it Was Released,"I think never has Taxi Driver been a more relevant movie to watch. Martin Scorsese's disturbing look at the life of a troubled, disenfranchised, unreliable narrator is engaging and visceral and powerful. The use of New York City as a secondary character in the movie is palpable and enhances the story and the viewing. Almost 50 years later the performances of DeNiro, Keitel, and Foster really still resonate. The film was so impactful that it created its own subgenera, of sorts. While we can't help but be disgusted but what DeNiro's Travis Bickel has become we understand that the foundation upon which his dysfunctional responses are based are not misguided. This character is often parodied and copied, but for his mannerisms and his classic lines; however, there is a depth and sympathetic quality to this character that only this Director and this actor could have brought out. I love Jeff Bridges, the original choice for the film, but he would have been a very different Travis Bickel. Watch this one, or watch it again. My only criticism is elements of the epilogue but this is a no spoiler review.",
162,15 October 2017,a_chinn,10," Profoundly disturbing but brilliant tale of urban isolation, obsession, and rage","Arguably Martin Scorsese's best film, writer Paul Schrader's best screenplay, and actor Robert De Niro's best performance. De Niro plays unstable Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle who the film follows down his rabbit hole of isolation, obsession, and eventual violent rage. The plot, as it is, has Bickle working nights as a NYC cab driver, becoming infatuated with pretty campaign worker, Cybill Shepherd, but when he sours that relationship due to his weird behavior, he becomes obsessed with saving pre-teen hooker Jodie Foster from her slimy pimp, Harvey Keitel. The plot could easily have become a simple Charles Bronson/grindhouse tale of urban vigilantism, but it's much more than that. Much has been written about ""Taxi Driver"" in terms of urban decay, isolation, desire, sex, misogyny, and as a critique of the media, all by others more eloquent than me, so I won't even try, but I will say that on a visceral level, the film is a ferociously disturbing piece of filmmaking. The audience is slowly drawn closer and closer to Bickle's madness, in a similar way to ""Repulsion"" or ""Peeping Tom."". The audience almost understands and sympathizes with his where his thinking is coming from and are found rooting for him against the even more despicable of characters during the film's disturbing finale. Scorsese has presented a New York City that truly is a brutal urban nightmare, but at the same time has created surreal hallucinatory vision of NYC that may only be Bickle's perception of reality. Also of note, the film features memorable performances by Victor Argo, Peter Boyle, and Albert Brooks. Additionally, this was the final film scored by Bernard Herrmann and he delivers a memorably unrelenting and oppressive score that ranks among his finest. Overall, ""Taxi Driver"" is one of the finest pieces of cinema ever committed to celluloid, though due to it's profoundly disturbing nature will likely deny the film wide appeal.",

165,2 October 2007,ciao77,10, A taxi ride you will never forget,"Taxi Driver is one of my all-time favorite movies. Each time I see it, I am absolutely amazed at De Niro's genius. Perhaps no other actor can better portray this, or most other characters, at least those that require a great deal of talent and the ability to really become the character. De Niro never fails to amaze, and Taxi Driver is far from being an exception. The main protagonist of the film, Travis Bickle, is an alienated, slightly psychotic Vietnam veteran-and NYC cab driver-who being absolutely disgusted with his surroundings (at night driving a cab through all parts of the city), takes it upon himself to save a very young prostitute, Iris,( played by Jodie Foster)from all the ""scum"" (recurrent theme)-and the life of a prostitute, including a pimp. He also falls in love with a woman who works on a political campaign for a fictional senator, Palantine. Although he fails to win her over, he does attempt to assassinate Palantine..perhaps he wants to be a hero, or to save his love interest from what he regards as a useless environment. The recurrent theme is clear throughout the film- Bickle attempts to help those with whom he becomes obsessed, from an environment that disgusts him. Paradoxically, however, the lonely, useless character becomes regarded as a hero, for going to great lengths to save the object of his obsession (Iris). Taxi Driver takes you through the mind and reasoning of a lonely, obsessive man, and his attempts to bring justice to those who ultimately do not understand or care for him.",

167,22 August 2018,andrewroy-04316,7, A very good character study about loneliness in urban society,"Taxi Driver is a very technically well done movie that didn't quite rivet me at any point. De Niro and Schrader both do excellent work in this film, and the themes Scorsese plays with are very well done. Travis' struggles to fit in with society naturally are well developed, as we see him try to be friendly with several characters and remain alone and dissatisfied at each turn. The personification of the city of New York was very well done. My favorite element of the movie was the use of the music and lighting as cues to show Travis' gradual descent into madness and violence. That being said, I found the ending to be good but not great and that the movie just didn't quite connect with me. It was very interesting thematically to have Travis kill the pimps and be treated as a hero for it, and end up right back in the same place driving a taxi and struggling to interact appropriately with Betsy, even after he was declared a hero. The shooting and his ability to move normally and live through the shots to his neck and shoulder were unrealistic, and the climax just didn't feel like anything more than a violent scene, it held little emotional weight for me. I have the utmost respect for Taxi Driver as a technically well done movie and study in the loneliness of a specific character in relation to society, but it's not a movie that was relatable to me or had me feeling invested in the characters.",

But if you're often fascinated, as I am, with entering into a different and disturbing psychological mindset and a subculture foreign to you, then Paul Schrader's brutal screenplay, filled as it is with profound self-loathing and anger, as well as an all-consuming sense of boredom and aching loneliness may be just the ticket to both perk your interest and ultimately make you feel a tiny bit better about your own neuroses. ""Hey, as weird as some of my thoughts may seem to be, at least I am no Travis Bickle!""

She plays a very important role in the movie but she only spends a couple minutes in it. When he says his inner thoughts in his head it gets pretty creepy. The whole movie is basically a spiral into darkness. The camera work is amazing. There are all sorts of weird camera techniques like the top down view after he fights the gangsters. Top down isn't a normal view and it makes you think he died like if he was having a out of body experience. There is also extensive use of mirrors to show De Niro's eyes while he's in the cab and in other places too. The music track is also really good. The saxophone is used very often but sometimes there is darker music alluding to possible darker things happening.

He wants to do what is right, he wants to do his part. He wants to help others that seem to carry the same impulse but are trapped victims of a modern age throwing its energy in the wrong directions. there is an echoing in this film that makes it clear that you are not the job you are employed to do. Here is a man who stands up and says 'NO' to all the bullshit. Here is......Here is a one man revolution crescendo. He feels he is on a mission. He feels that one must not dedicate his life to morbid self attention. A man waiting for a change, suddenly there is change, he makes it. Many will agree with me that this film is one tight masterpiece. Great chemistry between Director Martin Scorcese and actor Robert De Niro who after this film remained famous until now for his tough quote in the film ""You talking to me? Are You Talking to me?........"" Great script, great direction of photography, great cast and acting, great soundtrack, all very tightly fixed together. Superb direction! In my opinion this is definitely and almost undiscussably Scorcese's greatest of his greatest piece of work. I love how a secretary working in a voting office for a political candidate with another clerk parallels with the relationship between a sedated hooker and her pimps to say the least. This is the stuff that makes Travis feel all the more and more sick and he realizes it. He must do something, he sees these women as angels, good people like himself and he does not want the scum to touch them. As great as the crescendo is in this film, so is the dissolving, the relief at the end parallel to a fizz in his drink earlier in the film, a detail many fail to notice. Every detail has parallels in this film that are very necessary. However, whether you watch this film under a microscope like i did more than once or twice or simply at face value, as a film lover one would not fail to recognize even through its sheer feeling of suspense, that this is a great classic quality movie. Film making at its best. The ultimate cowboy movie. Very unconventional.",

This lack of clarity and confusion also reflects in the scoring, changing back and forth between being romantic and being mysterious. I see the inspiration of some later works in this movie, which may include Al Pacino's Insomnia, The acting side, on the other hand, is very nice. We get to see Robert DeNiro's totality in plating his character here. Jodie Foster, despite her rather short duration time, manages to give her role a significant meaning.

Martin Scorsese directed this in a ravishing, prepossessing and hedonistic modus operandi.

I couldn't sympathize with the main character due lack of cause- What caused him to be the way he is. There are no flashbacks and almost no hints except he was in the marines and got an honorable discharge.
Beyond that, the description for the movie includes the young prostitute. The problem with her is that she just... Doesn't fit being in the description at all. While being foreshadowed and shown in the start, she only held meaning and importance in the end, when our main character found where to put all his anger and frustration at. At the ""company"" she was working at, all because his assassination failed miserably. 
Except of frustration and anger and mental stability, there wasn't much to our main character. He had the Hero Complex, he thought himself to be a hero like in the movies. He had anger that fueled the complex. 
Beyond that- What's to him? Who is he as a person, aside of the complex and anger? What does he like? What was his dreams, aspirations? 
He's not that much of a character.

239,28 March 2019,gbill-74877,7, Disturbing,"Fantastic filmmaking, an outstanding cast, and cinematography that manages to be artistic and elevating, and yet also captures the grime and filth of New York City's seedier areas in the 1970's. Seriously, I felt like I needed a shower afterwards. That's also because the film is dark, and in several ways. It has an anti-hero who is a disturbed, pathetic loner. Child prostitution. Scenes that seem to glorify guns and violence. And an awful ending (and no, I'm not buying the dream theory). I believe it's all meant to be a brutal (and realistic) indictment of America, but it seems to me it also revels a bit in the mire of this grim world, and ironically glorifies some of the very things it's critiquing. I loved the shots of New York at night, and the effects with light, such as when they come through the back of the taxicab out of focus. I thought Jodie Foster at 14 was brilliant, and Robert De Niro (""You talkin' to me?"") was as well. I admire Scorsese the artist, but this one was too disturbing for me to want to see again (though I said the same thing when I first saw it years ago). Poke around and see how many people view Travis Bickle as a hero, instead of seeing in him what isolation, failure, frustration, and mental illness inevitably lead to, and you may get an idea of what I mean.",

242,16 January 2011,xtian_durden,10, One of the Greatest Film of All Time,"Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is an overwhelming reality of violence, and remained as one of the darkest picture about the transformation of an innocent being due to the environment that he's in. Opening with a lot of smoke, the taxi looked like it was emerged from hell. Travis Bickle is the one that's driving that taxi, he lives alone in his messy apartment, he's an insomniac, he eats a lot of junk foods and sugar, and the only show he knows to watch is pornography. At nights, during Travis' working hours, we take a look at the saturated color of New York, the dirty streets filled with all kinds of scum in Travis Bickle's deep paranoid eyes. During the day, we see the hope in living at a place like this, until Travis was rejected again by the society that he declares like a union, cold and distant. Travis' downward spiral cannot be stop, each time he is going deeper into violence. Travis' confrontation with violence is beginning to be excessive, hearing the words at the backseat by some mad husband planning to kill his wife with a .44 magnum, and in the streets some mad man shouting ""I'll kill her, I'll kill her"" only deepens Travis' idea of the bloodbath in the brothel later. He asks some advice from a fellow cab driver, Wizard. But they ended up not understanding each other's point, this is a critical moment for Travis, he seeks for clarity but did not get it, he was saying ""I've got some real bad ideas in my head."" And that idea will come to life, as he buys his own .44 magnum and different kinds of pistols, he gets his first kill on a small store trying to save it from a robber. Scorsese effectively isolated Travis from the society in each distant shot. Not only that Travis Bickle was influenced by Norman Bates, in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, but almost the whole film is Hitchcockian, from Scorsese's cameo, the homage on Rear Window in one scene and the frequent over the head shots. But at some point, Scorsese rises up from his master. In the second part of the film, Travis Bickle became John Wayne, trying to save a young prostitute from her pimp, a mirror plot from The Searchers. He acts again like a sane man, but he is slowly being dragged away from the reality. In the bloodbath, violence exploded, released from his captivity, he doesn't know what he is doing, but planned this thing obsessively and now that it happened, it is ironic that he was praised as a hero who rescues a young prostitute. The final scene as he drove Betsy into Manhattan, he seems like that he is back into sanity, but again he gave us a paranoid threatening look at the rear-view mirror, like the one he's been giving through the whole course of the film, and you know it might not be a happy ending after all. Bernard Herrmann's last score was truly a magnificent piece, it colored and shaped the image of Taxi Driver, haunting and unforgettable jazzy score. Martin Scorsese, Paul Schrader, Robert De Niro all in premium shape and at their best in this agonizing dark masterpiece. Taxi Driver is so affecting because this story is all too real, Travis Bickle is not just a character in a movie, he is the character of the society, he is the voice-over of the isolated humanity, victimized by the system of the world.",

So memorable is his working up to date the beautiful Cybil Shepard only to p*ss her off by taking her to a porno flick. Then trying to ""rescue"" a 12-year old runaway turned prostitute(Jodie Foster)and dealing with her sleazy pimp(Harvey Keitel).

Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a mentally unstable Vietnam veteran who has taken a job in New York city as taxi driver because he suffers insomnia. He grows increasingly disgusted by the lowlifes, scum and ""trash"" in the city at night, and this obviously doesn't help his attempt to get somewhere with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), who represents the vote for Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris), he even takes her to a porn movie on the first date! He fails also to help 12-year-old prostitute Iris (twice BAFTA winning newcomer Jodie Foster) to desert her pimp 'Sport' Matthew (Harvey Keitel). Driven to insanity of powerlessness he buys four handguns and is intent on assassinating the Senator. Donning a Mohawk hairdo he is ready, but when he can't get close enough, he is gunned down in the end after killing Matthew, oh, he didn't die, and he returned to being a taxi driver. Also starring Peter Boyle as Wizard and Albert Brooks as Tom.

The film was written by a man then on the brink in Paul Schrader, but a man with a brilliant mind all the same whilst it was directed by one of America's more up and coming contemporary filmmakers in Martin Scorsese. The two minds come together and Taxi Driver is the result, one of my personal favourites and a landmark of sorts in modern cinema.",

263,30 June 2013,rsabnis1,8, The Most Organ-azized Drama Ever,"Taxi Driver is an American drama directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Paul Schrader inspired from 1956 John Ford film 'The Searchers'. The screenplay is crafted so artistically by Paul showcasing a raw, nerve- wrecking and powerful look at depression and solitude. The film has the capability to become an altogether successful venture when the actor-director synergy can make astonishing wonders happen. De Niro and Scorsese happen to be one such example. The collaboration between these two has given us some of the really extravagant films. The movie starts with a Taxi moving in a slow motion as it leaves a foggy smoke behind as credit starts appearing in the cloud of smoke giving a more artistic feel to the beginning of the movie. Travis Bickle an ex-Marine officer suffering from chronic insomnia returns to Manhattan, New York after the Vietnam War. A person having no real life experience in flesh-and-blood human relationships gets alienated in the city of aflame and enthusiastic people. Travis takes up a job as a taxi driver on a night duty travelling around the city watching the night- life and prowlers that rule the streets of NY after nightfall. He is a person who tries to mimic the interactions he sees on the streets and goes horribly wrong, watches dirty movie in a porno theater, falls for a girl working in the Senator Palantine's campaign, takes her for a porn movie making her feel awkward and terribly angry. His small acts highlight his lack of human touch and his unstable mind. The director had pivoted the confused notions of the protagonist successfully as the audience was meant to assume him to be a psycho. Travis in the latter half of the movie, fails in repeated attempts to get his love back and finally makes up his mind to assassinate the Senator only to flaunt his prejudice. After a failed Palantine assassination, Travis freeds himself from frustration as he guns down three men who he holds responsible for corrupting a girl's youth in a brothel to rescue a 12 year old prostitute named Iris in an unsurpassed bloodbath. Scorsese proved himself a creative genius through Taxi driver. Only part remains undisclosed in movie is the reason Iris chose to run away from home only to become a prostitute at an age where she ought to be going to school, giving an uneasy feeling to the viewers. Like all the Scorsese directed films, redemption is the soul of the film. The audience, terrified and overwhelmed by urban crime will readily respond to any film about heroic vigilantism in future.

269,27 May 2007,DeathFish,10, Character development.,"Martin Scorsese's masterpiece Taxi Driver, was in the beginning met by various criticism and accusations. Many shut their eyes and were appalled by the violence and uncovered nature of the film. Even though judged by some, others witnessed the revelation of a genuine film-pearl, as Robert De Niro's character ""Travis Bickle"" entered the screen. The protagonist in this movie, is perhaps one the most complex and thorough characters in the history of film-making. Because of the extreme centralization of the main-character, the entire movies perspective takes basis in Travis' own perception and interpretation of the world around him. Every scene in the movie becomes, because of the focus on Travis, very subjective and personalized. We witness the world through his eyes, and take over his prejudices and beliefs. Travis lives in the busy and crowded city, but nonetheless he is alone. Loneliness is in many ways the very essence of his being, and at some point it almost becomes his identity. Walking through the streets alone, as a nobody, he dreams of being a somebody. He longs for company, both socially, sexually and intellectually, but cannot seem to find it anywhere. In his attempt to find company he finds Betsy, a young beautiful blond who develops an interest in him, but his social inexperience repels her from him, and he is left alone, even more lonely than before. The entire film is right from the beginning heading for the very debated violence near the end of the film, this also goes for Travis' life. His life has always in some way headed for this moment and therefore it is given even more importance. His Mohawk is a symbol of rage and lust for blood, which the native Indians possessed before they were going to battle, a so-called warning signal. The foundation of the movie is character development of the main character. This development is clouded and complex and at the same time obvious and simple. Only through repeated viewings can the full development of Travis be discovered and analyzed. Every little piece of conversation, monologue, action or sound plays a part in the corruption and development of Travis' mental state. The plot itself is very simple but still intriguing and luring. The cooperation, or lack of same, between Scorsese and the writer Paul Schrader, has a fantastic influence on the film and gives it its' multidimensional flow. Basically everything from writing to screenplay, directing, acting and setup is superb and flawless. The movies many aspects and open possibility to interpretation, makes it ideal to repeated viewings and second thoughts. The directing is on top level, and the great debut by Jodie Foster together with Robert De Niro's fantastic acting makes sure that the entire potential of the movie is used. Fabulous achievement. 10/10",

The film rarely strays too far from the highly subjective and personal way in which you see the city and let it hurt you.

He hates what he sees on the streets, he wishes that all the scum and filth would be rid of. Martin Scorsese treats New York as one of his stars because he shows what went on in New York in the eyes of Travis Bickle.

This is one of Robert de Niros first performances in a blockbuster movie. He is quite young, but that does not mean his acting is any less amazing. The movie has some flaws. It was made in 1976 and like many other movies from that period does not age that well. I compair this movie to joker (2018). The two movies are more or less the same story. A lowlife with a depressing job and a viced sence of reality tries to make the world a better place by doing something no one else wants to. This sums up both the movies pretty well. I my opinion Joker told this story in a much better way. Taxi driver is an well known movie for a reason and Robert De Niro's character is icon. It has a lot of good scenes with funny characters. I am giving the movie a 7 and i truly believe it deserves such a good score even tho I have criticized it a lot in the review. It is all in all a good movie I would recommend seeing if you want to know more about movie history. It is a good representation of a 70's psychological thriller and an interesting watch.",
309,13 August 2020,aryansinghindo,10, I am the only one here!!!,"Simply Scorsese's best film so far. It represents a disturbing picture of New York and its deteriorating situation filled with scums and filth where a normal taxi driver goes out on his own to end the city of its miserable state.
Suffering from insomia, he descends into insanity after coming across a teen prostitute and its aftermath.
Simply brilliant story with stellar performance by Robert de Niro who is probably at his best with this. A perfect dark and intriguing drama with a realistic depiction of the corruptness of the world where we live in, brilliant use of score and how can we forget the most iconic dialogue: you talking to me!!!!!
Don't miss this insane masterpiece",

Robert DeNiro gives what I believe is his best performance ever as Travis Bickle. He tells everything so well, so in-depth that I could actually picture every scene he described even when it was not shown. Travis Bickle reminds me a lot of myself. I could relate to him in so many ways it was almost scary. Im not saying we're the SAME but similar in many ways. This isn't a movie for the type who only like modern movies with ""200% action"". They have no soul. This movie HAS soul. This is a film for true movie fans. Robert DeNiro was great, but so were the others. Cybill Shepherd gave quite a performance as DeNiro's ""5-minute flame"" Betsy. Jody Foster actually played very well as the 12-year old prostitute Iris Steensma. Peter Boyle was very well cast as Bickle's cabby friend Wizard. Even Harvey Keitel shows a good performance as Iris' pimp, Matthew aka ""Sport"".

Why's he trying to kill Palantine? Why is he a hero for taking the law into his own hands? How does killing a few pimps bring him back his sanity, when the sleaze and filth he loathes is still all around him? And, really, what's with the mohawk? ",

Editing was superb as well, keeping the pace going it what's actually kinda a slow film. It doesn't feel slow at all.

318,12 January 2002,mercuryadonis,10, Travis Bickle is the definitive Gotham City avenger...,"If only bad-ass cartoon characters like Batman and Spawn could muster  one-tenth of the psychotic rage Travis Bickle possesses. Bickle's cape is the Vietnam Marine jacket that he wears throughout the film.  The way ""Bickle"" is stenciled  on the back it might as well be a giant ""S"" or the insipid Bat logo that various actors have exhibited though a series of pointless films.  The whole film unspools like a dream that a Vietnam grunt could be envisioning while dying in a rice paddy on the other side of the world. (Oh, wait, that was Jacob's Ladder...) Travis is a gratingly rascist  and moralistic character and the black pimps and drag queens he regards with such contempt through his cab window could be stand-ins for the Vietcongs he couldn't quite vanquish when he had the chance.  His plan to assassinate the Presidential candidate is undertaken with the same ritualistic precision of a military mission.  For Bickle the war has not ended and he has simply transposed the conflict onto the streets of New York. His bipolar view of the world--people are either angels like Betsy or ""scum sucking scum"" like Sport--is eerily prophetic of America's current perception of world events. (You're either with us or you're with the terrorists)  When Travis wishes for  ""a real rain that'll wash the scum off the streets"" he sounds chillingly like John Ashcroft or, Dubya, or even Guiliani (who almost accomplished what Travis couldn't)  It's sobering to think that an outlook as disturbed and childishly naive as Travis' could morph into the mainstream point of view.

De Niro is truly in a class of his own in this movie, which portrays loneliness in a way few movies have successfully captured since. It's a sad but excruciatingly well-done neo-noir thriller that gave us the big-screen career breakthrough of Jodie Foster, playing under-age hooker Iris. Yeah: quite the breakthrough right there.",

If you add that to a completely mind-blowing screen play by Paul Schrader you got yourself a movie that you cannot forget about when you leave the theater.  Robert DeNiro IS Travis Bickle, a veteran who lives what many consider to be a greatly disturbing life, but it seems very normal to him.  And, of course, how could you possibly forget the line, one of the most famous lines of all time ""Are you talking to me""  I can relate to that part and I think that most other people can to.  I think everybody at least once in their life talked to themselves in the mirror asking yourself questions.  This is a great film and Travis Bickle will never be forgotten.",
322,2 July 2016,elitecktiel,10, A documentation of a man's gradual descent into madness,"In my opinion, this is the best film of all time. The cinematography was definitely of high quality. Also, this was the final soundtrack composer Bernard Herrmann made before he died. The jazzy soundtrack captures both Manhattan in the 70s and the growing loneliness of the main character, Travis Bickle. I've always loved the way the film is almost entirely centered around Bickle. It never focuses on a character unless they're with Bickle. Aside from the beginning of the scene at the campaign office, the film is all about his mental health. In the beginning, the viewer perceives Travis as an extremely lonely and somewhat socially awkward character. As the film progresses, these two character traits cause him distress and sadness. It is the two main traits he had in the beginning of the film when he was more sane that caused him to lose his mind. Bickle had trouble interacting with other people and maintaining healthy relationships with them. He didn't have any close family or friends to support him and for him to spend time with. Because he was constantly alone and being rejected by society, he spends his time either in his rundown apartment or driving his taxi in the sleazy streets of New York City in the 1970s. When Bickle ends up connecting with a teen prostitute who stepped into his car, the underlying hero in his character begins to show, but still in a subtle way. Late in the movie, it becomes quite clear to the viewer that Travis is going to attempt to save this young girls life. This shows that some good still remains in his character. His intentions, however, are still troubling because at the same time as selflessly helping a confused teenager get a better life, Bickle begins to further succumb to his insanity and makes plans to assassinate a senator who is running for president. When this proves to be unsuccessful, he focuses on helping the prostitute. Travis's mental health is seemingly very inconsistent at this point. Why would he want to help the girl? The reason he wanted to help her was the same reason he wanted to kill the senator. All his life, he had been rejected by the society surrounding him. So, he figures if he could get any kind of national attention, positive or negative, people might finally stop completely disregarding him. Although the ending was left pretty ambiguous, we find out that he has in fact reached his goal of getting the public's attention. And instead of negative attention like he would've gotten had he killed the senator, he got positive attention. Overall, this is quite possibly the best movie I've ever seen. Every aspect of it is flawless. 10/10.",

Travis Bickle is simply the most charming character of movie history: he's not a hero, he's not intelligent nor good looking, nor tragic in the traditional sense of the term, yet no one before him has entered into possession of the screen with such power and naturalness. It's useless to quote particular scenes in a movie which from the beginning to the end carves its name on the rock of history, proclaiming itself as an absolute masterpiece and Robert De Niro as one of the greatest actors of all times, surely the best of the last 25 years.

The film industry did Scorsese a favor when they threatened an X Rating if he didn't tone down the blood. So they made the scene basically black and white. Which made it look more creepy dream like and surreal. The only film I ever attended where viewers ran out of the theatre. People were shocked.

This is a very impressive character study about the distraught life of a loner who meanders through the streets of New York City.  Travis Bickle came to be one of the most famous fictional characters in movie history.  Almost every one of us can relate to Travis in some sort of way.  And it's great how Scorcese used DeNiro's explicit narration to bring us--literally--into the mind of this relatively harmless loner with unrelenting anger beginning to rise to the surface.  And it's the way DeNiro flawlessly portrayed Bickle, displaying every tiny mannerism, that also gets the audience engaged.  Sure, this is an unpleasant, graphic journey through this virtual hellhole--but that's exactly what it is!  Anyone who's been around the streets of New York City at night--and actually survived!--knows fully well that Scorcese flashes every picturesque detail in our faces to receive a perfect vision of the City That Never Sleeps--which is especially true through the eyes of our protagonist.  Later in the film, we watch as Travis works out streneously and purchases guns, mind clouded with thoughts of murder.  But that violent episode is a demonstration of the anger that pumps through anybody's veins in his situation, only Travis outwardly acted upon those thoughts.  We watch as his love for this young prostitute--played brilliantly by Jodie Foster--blossoms and he will do anything to keep her off the streets and out of the hands of her arrogant pimp. ",

That is very wrong. Taxi Driver also has one of the greatest characters ever put on film in Travis Bickle. The story is genius, I love how they show Travis as a loner, not a psychopath, or more precisely a loner in the beginning.

The acting is amazing, Robert De Niro gives one of the best performances of all time, while Jodie Foster and others are all great.

337,3 November 2019,CubsandCulture,6, Technically polished but ultimately a very ugly film,"I have this problem with a lot of Scorsese films but Taxi Driver is a thoughtful exploration of how a damaged psyche coupled with the Vietnam era violence, just below the surface, of the system, results in self destructive behavior. It deals with how media, capital and the disillusionment with America leads to isolation and alienation, especially for young white men of that time period. And how media narratives reduce such damaged people down to tropes which are often wrong. I see the cinematic influences of the French New Waver-i.e. jump cuts-and the legacy of cinema's past-i.e. this is a twisted noir take on the Searchers-that make the film pop cinematically. And De Niro's performance is extremely well considered. But for all that I simply don't care. I don't care how the techniques are used. And I don't care about the thoughtful exploration. At the end of the day Travis Bickle is the worse of us and while the film does not celebrate him per se I don't find much beauty or sublimity in exploring such figures.",

There are obviously some disturbing subject matters covered in this story, and that's part of the drive in getting you, the viewer, to have perhaps some empathy for the taxi driver played by DeNiro.

349,6 May 2017,inemjaso,10, Perhaps one of the greatest films ever made,"I'm not sure where to begin talking about this classic, so I guess I'll start with its star: Robert DeNiro. Movie lovers have asked me in the past which of The Godfather actors had the most prolific career-Brando, Pacino, or DeNiro? Though Brando's career is probably unmatched in iconic presence and award merit, DeNiro takes the spot for me as the greatest actor of this trio. I, for example, thought he was superior to Brando as Vito Corleone. In Taxi Driver, DeNiro proves all skeptics that he's right up there with Nicholson as one of the all time greats. The film is told from the first person perspective of 20 something Vietnam vet Travis Bickle, played by DeNiro. Bickle is extremely lonely, depressed, and suffers from chronic insomnia. He works the night shift as a NYC cab driver and spends most of his free time in seedy pornographic theaters. DeNiro's performance in this movie, including his iconic monologue in front of the mirror, is perhaps the apex of his phenomenal career. In addition to DeNiro, Jodie Foster, an equally impressive actor, got her start here playing Iris, an adolescent prostitute whom Bickle attempts to save from her abusive pimp and general unsafe lifestyle. Overall, this film explores Bickle's damaged sense of reality, self and his emotional capacity for impulsive violence. It is a fine cinematic achievement that any fan of movies must see.",

""Taxi Driver"" is a piece of cinematic entertainment which has to be seen to be believed and if anyone hates this film, there's something seriously wrong in their head.

361,14 December 2016,nplumley518,9, Taxi Driver Review,"When I heard of this movie, Taxi Driver, I was instantly interested in it for two reasons. One of which is because Martin Scorsese directed it and another is Robert De Niro. In my eyes Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of all time and every De Niro film is a hit. Taxi Driver takes you deep inside the mind of a veteran marine and his life as a taxi driver. Later becoming a vigilante to clean up the streets of pimps and crime. I felt De Niro did an absolutely amazing job portraying this mentally psychotic bad ass in my opinion. The cinematography in this film is done so well in this film, in particular, all the night scenes I felt had this gloomy and captivating mood to it through low lighting, shadows, and the diegetic sound you could hear. Overall, incredible film. Can't believe it took me this long to watch this film.",
362,2 September 2015,timlanders,9, Listen as well as watch,"Writing music for film is truly an exceptional art-form but one, if done correctly, that is rarely lauded outside of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Case in point: Taxi Driver. Bernard Herman's score for Taxi Driver is so deliciously haunting and descriptive that if it weren't so perfectly written and executed it would pop out of the film and take your attention away. Herman's character themes become such an integral part of their development that you don't realize how interwoven the score is to each portrayal until the film is finished and the music begins to linger in your memory - bringing with it the appropriate visual. Just as he did with the Alfred Hitchcock films he'd scored, Herman creates the iconic aural colorization that makes you wonder how the story could have ever existed without it.",

Well I'm the Only One Here.,"Taxi Driver (1976): Dir: Martin Scorsese / Cast: Robert De Niro, Cybil Shepherd, Jodie Foster, Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel: Provocative thriller about loneliness and the vessel of danger. Travis Bickle drives a cab and observes everything he hates. He tries to connect with two women. One is involved in a political campaign while the other is a teenage prostitute. Ending is both questionable and observant on how it presents the media as celebrating the diabolical and rewarding it through press. Directed skillfully by Martin Scorsese who previously scored acclaim with Mean Streets. Robert De Niro as Travis rose to great fame with this role. Bickle is a failure with women and cannot communicate appropriately even when his intentions are good. He answers rejection through an assassination attempt and a murder rescue, both of which bring different results. Cybil Shepherd plays Betsy whom he loses connection due to a fatal choice. She is working at a campaign when Travis bluntly asks her out. Jodie Foster plays Iris the teenage hooker he desires to save. Albert Brooks plays Betsy's campaign co-worker whom she doesn't connect with despite his work ethics and amusing demeanor. Harvey Keitel plays Iris's pimp who has a sly smooth demeanor that Bickle targets as a necessary kill. Dark and gritty reality of good intentions gone bad and unable to discern. Score: 9 / 10",

Part of Scorsese's genius is his ability to create powerful and lasting art featuring unlikeable characters at the core. Timing was a factor working in his favor ever since censorship restrictions were replaced by a ratings system in the late Sixties.

372,18 May 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8," A subversive and unflinching character-study with one of the most nuanced, well-realised protagonists of all time.","'Taxi Driver (1976)' is an interesting, subversive and unflinching character study, an amalgamation of genres that provides unexpectedly affecting results. You'd expect it to be a thriller, but it is actually more of a slow and methodical drama - despite all of its violence and otherwise seedy elements. As with most of Scorsese's work, the picture isn't interested in judging any of its characters or mindsets, no matter how deplorable they might be. Rather, it depicts its events with a candid honesty and asks us, the audience, to make up our own minds about them. This could sometimes be misconstrued as glamorisation, especially in its sequences involving guns and the 'cool' portrayal of 'masculinity' surrounding them, but I don't think this is the case. By portraying every scene in the same 'flat' way, the feature opens itself up to analysis, which is necessary on the part of every viewer - or, at least, those willing to think. It invites interpretation and critique, not of itself but of the choices of its characters. Speaking of characters, this features some of the most deplorable characters in any of Scorsese's work. These mostly arise in the latter movement of the piece, surrounding Jodie Foster's child prostitute character, and the moments including them are uncomfortable to say the least. As is the implication that more of them exist within the city, unseen but ready to crawl from beneath the surface or having just scuttled back down below. The feature is disturbing, especially in these harsher sequences, but it never crosses the line. It just maintains its method of being as candid as possible, portraying its seedy situations and asking us to do the judging for it. These moments don't make it hard to understand our protagonist's mindset that the city is filled with scum, though. Speaking of our protagonist, 'Travis Bickle' is easily one of the most unique and well-realised characters ever put to film. He certainly isn't a hero, he isn't even an anti-hero, but he also isn't a villain. He's just a man struggling, alone, to cope with his mental-illness and otherwise keep himself afloat. His deterioration from lonely and despondent to angry and disturbed, ultimately homicidal, is a compelling and engaging one. You like him and want him to be okay, but the events of the film weigh down on his already damaged psyche and turn his disillusion to all-out rage. The delusion that his violence could be motivated by pseudo altruism, a need to save - or 'clean' - his city, is one that only serves his need to justify his actions. He needs to act out his newfound impulses for no-one other than himself. Whether his first attempt fails due to extenuating circumstances as it appears or if it is due to his conscience is up for debate, as is if he wants to 'save' anyone at all. What isn't, is that he needs to act out his urges on someone, and he just so happens to do it on the right people. That's the only way he could ever be labelled a 'hero', and dangerously so. The 'downward spiral' arc isn't often done, though, and that, along with the fact it is done so deftly, is why it is so captivating to watch. The structure of the overall piece is unconventional, too, with a dream-like feel compounding its sort of 'aimed aimless' vibe. The performances and writing are excellent, both combining to make one of the most nuanced characters in film history. For me, this is the definitive Robert De Niro role. He should have won an Oscar for his work here. The two-handed score is phenomenal, as well. It combines flashes of our lead's possibly traumatic past with another character's certainly traumatic present, foreshadowing their fateful meeting. The direction is great, too, and serves to add to the effect that we are peeking into a man's life, a man who could be living next door. That makes the film quite scary. It's also sublime. A fantastic piece of work that's subversive, unconventional, uncomfortable and deeply affecting. 8/10.",

There must be some point i am failing to see, but what i did see was a hap hazard storyline that ends in a completely dull murder sequence before some girl from a tempory romance earlier in the film turns up out of the blue for a ride in his taxi. De Niros acting is great but i just struggle to tell what this story is really about - Travis and Betsy, wanting to murder Palpitine, wanting to free Iris from her pimps. I see the turning point in Travis' head when he takes a passanger to see his cheating wife and the passanger says he's ging to kill her, but surely this would never be so motivating as to make somebody kill 3 people for the life of one girl you have had 2 very minimal, insignificant interactions with.

375,25 April 2010,Chris_BS1212,10," Scorsese, Schrader, and De Niro combine to deliver a masterpiece","In Taxi Driver Scorsese gives us a deep character study of a lonely man, ""God's lonely man"" if we're to believe our narrator Travis Bickle (De Niro). Travis is a Vietnam veteran who takes a job as a taxi driver at night in New York because he can't sleep. He cruises around New York looking for a fare and constantly finds himself drawn to the seediest parts of the city, despite his hatred of everything these places stand for and the people who live and make their living there. Right from the start we have an idea of where Travis is going from when his cab emerges from the white smoke of hellfire. Not literally of course but there is plenty of similar imagery throughout from the overhead view of the guns that the dealer lays out on the bed like a priest looking down at the altar to when Travis holds his clenched fist above the gas fire stove.

If a movie wins a few Oscars and is labeled as a ""classic"", the title sticks and everyone must bow down to it. If someone challenges this titleeven so much as asks, ""Why is it a classic?""they're ironically turned into a laughable fool by fools laughing. The paradoxical problem with this is that no one can really defend the so-called classics. All you ever hear in the defense of films like Taxi Driver when criticism arises is a list of the film's awards, or a list of the film's critical acclaim, or just, ""It's a classic, so shut up!"" There have been far more original, thought-provoking, well-made movies that never even get the public's attention, much less won overrated Oscars. When people challenge the so-called classics with this fact, the notion is never entertained, and oftentimes foolishly laughed at or stupidly dismissed as childish or immature. With everything I just said as a backbone, I'm about to challenge the ""classic"" Taxi Driver. If you're open-minded you'll give this review a chance.

The premise is quite simple, a night taxi driver is fed up with the filth in his city and begins a violent mission. The main character, Travis Bickle (an excellent Robert De Niro), is the model of a broken, marginalized and lonely man, something that Scorsese transports to the visual plane. But really the great success of the film is the construction of the protagonist, which is so perfect that the protagonist himself is the film and all the events in it lead to it in a negative or positive way. The final purple catharsis is only the result of everything the film has built to bring the character to that point.
This highly negative character, from whom thousands more like him have emerged in the history of cinema, is proof of how the protagonist is enough to be the column of a film and fully support it without the need for other elements. Travis Bickle has gone down in history as one of the most recognizable characters and this is not for less, without him this film could not have become what it is today.",

394,3 June 2023,CinemaSerf,7, Taxi Driver,"Robert De Niro is outstanding in this dark and gritty depiction of former marine ""Travis Bickle"". He spends his time, alone, driving his cab at night then watching seedy movies during the day. This relentless cycle is broken when he takes a shine to ""Betsy"" (Cybill Shepherd), a campaign worker for a would be US Presidential candidate. There is a glimmer of hope for him, as she agrees to go out with him for a movie - but when he takes her to his usual haunt for a Swedish film that perhaps wasn't quite Ingmar Bergman, he ends up back at square one. Simultaneously, he takes a more protective interest in the young ""iris"" (Jodie Foster) - a teenage hooker who is being used abused by her pimp, and to that end he acquires some firearms with which he is perfectly proficient, and so finally starts to see a purpose for his hitherto rather rudderness existence. Director Martin Scorsese and veteran scorer Bernard Hermann have created a wonderfully convincing and evocative scenario emphasising the seediness of a night time New York in which De Niro is able to thrive as few other actors could. He exudes a sense of helplessness but also of decency; he has integrity almost in spite of the indifference of his city, his peers - and by the end, I was firmly in his corner. If you can see it up on a big screen, then do so - it lends a great deal to this wonderfully atmospheric and potent piece of cinema.",
395,28 February 2016,lesleyharris30,7," Not Scorsese's Best, although the Performances are Outstanding,","Taxi Driver is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. The highlight of the entire movie would have to be the actors, Robert De Niro shines as Travis Bickle, one of his deepest and most intense performances, the best scenes had to be between him and a very young Jodie Foster, their on screen chemistry is sublime, you could see that she understood acting from a very young age. However, I found it hard to get pulled in to this story, mainly because Travis was not a likable character, he's strange, suspicious and we are never made entirely clear of his intentions, the final scene is outstanding, but somewhat confusing, he may have been saving this girl but it was far more extreme than anything he had done previously, which made sense, but there was not enough build up to drive the character to that level of insanity, I understand that he is an anti-hero, but I had no support for him whatsoever. I think Cybil Shepherd was miscast in this movie and is without a doubt my least favourite part, she had no chemistry with De Niro, I know she was suppose to be confused and unsure of her love for Bickle, but I felt nothing from her, she was reading her lines. The story is also quite messy, I expected better from Scorsese, Travis goes from an everyday taxi driver to a corrupt one so easily that we never feel a proper transition, he seems to become crazier by each scene for no apparent reason, and a proper arch to this story does not come around till we meet Foster's character, but this still feels underdeveloped, their relationship could have been established more, so that the last ten minutes would not just feel like they were tying up loose ends. I am a huge fan of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, and while I appreciate their work on Taxi Driver, I have come to expect more from the people who brought me such greats as Raging Bull, The King of Comedy and Goodfellas, but it's an iconic movie that should not be missed by any movie buff.

Although the film is told entirely from the point of view of the driver (well played by De Niro), we are given few clues as to what makes him tick or what pushes him over the edge.

402,1 April 2008,Dr_Coulardeau,9, 1976 is coming back again,"1976 was a funny electoral year. One year after the full defeat in Vietnam and the evacuation of Saigon on the run. Two years after the resignation of Nixon, to avoid an impeachment that would have led to the very first conviction of the President. 1976 was the year when all had to changed, and nothing really changed because the establishment just looked for a way to save face and restore the everyday standard imperialistic power, and of course that will fail with Jimmy Carter, but Scorsese could not know it though everyone knew that success would be a miracle. What's more, success in that line was doomed in the long run. It was not yet possible to know what was going to happen in China, but we could know it was going to change, even if it was quite clear that the Soviet Union was not going to change at all, even if we could not know the industrialized feudal soviet system was going to fall down the chute, was going to be flushed down the drain. That was what Scorsese meant with his crossroads but he did not know how many roads there were in that crossroads nor where they led nor of course which one to take. But one thing was sure in those days: the US were going to take a road that did not lead to any confrontation with their real historical mission which is to create democracy through freedom in a system that had to improve itself all the time because it knew perfection did not exist in this world, be it only because perfection is divine and cannot be found in a non-divine world, in a human world, what's more in a human sinner's world. It was sure the US were not going to face their historical fate and their inner problems and their inner challenges like for example the racial problem, like for example the education of their young, like for example the control of violence, like for example a health care system that was more than necessary. The film is a vague echo of that particular challenge with the allusion to the welfare system, because that was where the US stood at the time: helping the poor. But Warhol had already exposed that problematic solution by showing in his films how vain, hypocritical and corrupted the welfare system was in the US, and that could not be an objective for the US, an objective they could put in their constitution in the form of a new amendment, the only way to really improve the system is by making it constitutional since then to repeal such an amendment is particularly difficult. But the film has aged tremendously since today the US have reached the end of that road, the bad road they chose in 1976. They are deep in the mud of a new war (the Buddhist have a nice saying about elephant getting caught in mud) that has been rejected by the world from the very start, they are confronted to the emerging of a world power they will have to share responsibilities with sooner or later so let it be now, the famous BRIC, Brazil, Russia, India and China, and that has to be done straight away since that BRIC is already the first economic power in the world and will be the first political power in the world within a few years. What's more the US is deeply agitated by the necessity to finally come to terms with the racial divide and the racial problem, by the obligation to provide all Americans with a full health care system, by the duty to provide every American with the possibility to educate themselves even if the government has to cut the military budget to do that. The good old three objectives of equality, good health and education in a system that would recapture freedom and democracy, both having been impaired and limited in the process of the US negating history in order to impose their own self centered epiphanic power. But what does Scorsese envisioned beyond 1976? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The system was defeated in a way. That's why the film has aged since the US and Americans finally have the chance today to be able to choose the road that would lead to their finally getting to political adult age.",
403,7 December 2016,boeseadamj,9, An isolated NYC taxi driver gets fed up with the apathetic city he lives in.,"This film is madly interesting. Its examination of Travis makes me examine my own morals. The murder of the pimps in itself is less problematic than Travis's motivations. Travis's loneliness reaches the audience on some visceral level as well as his disgust with society to some extent. But their is still something unnerving about him as a character and I feel uncomfortable condoning his actions even though I sort of do. And that is a really powerful struggle that this film conveys. A disturbing and alienating view of this character that the audience still understands. I also appreciate the very strong visual storytelling that this film contains. Martin Scorsese is a master behind the camera, especially during scenes like the classic mirror scene, or alka seltzer close up. The decision to hold the camera just a little longer than perhaps some other directors is very bold, not to mention effective.",

405,1 July 2013,poe426,10, All too plausible...,"Take it from someone who drove a cab for years: the TAXI DRIVER scenario is all-too-plausible. DeNiro's performance is dead on: I saw more than one ""Travis Bickle"" out there on the streets at night, men who carried guns (though it's illegal for a cabbie to carry one in this town), who drove drunk (or worse), who robbed passengers (often by running what's known as ""a hot meter,"" where the meter is switched from a mileage counter to a timer, usually at long stoplights, thereby allowing the driver to make more money off of the unwitting passenger) and who talked incessantly of ""cleaning up the city"" (a common refrain, especially among former cops). Of course, some of this behavior is understandable: cabbies themselves must pay for their own gas at the end of every shift (which means that, more often than one would wish, one ends up owing The Company money at the end of the night); the driver eats it when a customer bails out on him and doesn't pay (a common occurrence with college kids, who think it's funny); if a cab goes down (usually because of a slack mechanic- and the term ""reliable mechanic"" is as much an oxymoron as ""honest lawyer"" or ""trustworthy politician""), it's the Driver (as most of them like to be called, ""hack"" or ""cabbie"" being each in their own way demeaning) who's s*** out of luck: bills to pay or not, if there's no cab for you to drive, you don't go out; and robbery (you're on your own if you get robbed- and, if you don't have the money to pay The Company their 50% of each fare for the night, you OWE The Company). Because I wasn't part of the Inner Circle where I worked, I usually got the s***-end of the stick every night- what were known as ""the crack runs."" I wasn't allowed to refuse a fare and, because the dispatcher had it in for me, I eventually came to be known as Crack Man. More than once, I came THIS close to dying out there: I once had a crack dealer literally hanging from the passenger window of my cab grappling with my passenger over a piece of ""rock"" (crack cocaine). A crowd of dealers charged my cab. I proceeded to pull a manuver that I remembered, quite literally, from Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND (see chapter five). It saved my life.

Some scenes, and I use the word more here, are just repellent. But it's not a nice world out there on the cold streets of New York's lower class areas, populated by all types of sleaze, Deniro so flatteringly describes, as well as to it's solution., many will agree with. He's an unforgettable hero icon, who's been a living inspiration to a lot of wannabe tough guys, and movie goers, and we shares Travis's views, all down the line. He's a fictional character who will never be forgotten, in one of Scorsese's most brilliant and daring works, contrary to many unsavory critics. We shares Travis's world, anger, annoyance, aggravation, frustration, denial, all pent up, but when it explodes towards the end, it's deadly, culminating in him being praised a hero, when returning twelve year pro, Iris (Foster) to her family. Travis, on the account of a lack of sleep, takes a job as a hack- taxi driver, cruising all over town to the worst of it, picking up some real dirt, where too from Deniro's perspective, includes a senator running for the coming election, who again, is all talk. The cab ride scene, with him is interesting to watch from Deniro's slightly tipped mind, praising him, where really he's taking the p..s out of him. It took me a few viewings to grasp onto the concept. Harvey Keitel in one of his best performances, is great as a lowlife, scum sucking pimp. It's a performance of detestable brilliance, while Cybill Shepherd holds your attention, as a sexy campaigner, who's becomes Travis's short lived love, and he is a acute observer of people too. Deniro of course is masterful as Travis Bickle, his eyes, penetrating, sometimes gives us cause to think, violence is only seconds away, his whole body form takes on character, like nothing you've seen before, showing many anxious and nervous emotions. He does have a sort of perverted sense of humor too, but we know where this is leading. Taxi Driver only becomes gory towards the end, in two graphic frank scenes, where he really explodes, but this is what the whole movie has been building up. This is what we've been waiting for. Those scenes are truly warranted. Taxi Driver is masterful work in it's almost now, 40 year existence, and will live on many many years yet as a movie classic, steered by one of the greatest actors on earth.

For example, for a man who thought the city was full of immorality and degenerates why did he think it was all right to spent his free time in X Rated theaters? And what made him think it was OK to take a girl he just met to a porn film? Also, what possessed him to cut his hair into a mohawk and why did it appear that he was going to kill the nominee for president when he ended up killing Iris's pimp? The only answers I was able to come up with was as a former Marine, he needed to validate himself once he re-entered society.

But alas, time marches on and thirty years later this movie is a dated relic of a bygone era. The New York City of 1976 is not the New York City of 2006; indeed the same can be said for all of society. But that's not the movie's fault. Rather, in the ensuing thirty years since this movie was first released, so much has happened, and so many technological and demographic changes have occurred, that the movie is now passé. What was considered shocking then is now almost commonplace in movies today. For instance, the idea of a 13 year old girl being a prostitute certainly raised lots of eyebrows in 1976, but today would gain scant notice. Even the main character, Travis Bickle, being a Vietnam War veteran today would mean little if anything. Indeed, would a guy like Travis Bickle even be driving a taxi in New York City today? Could he even afford to live in New York? And would a guy like Sport be a pimp? Not likely. Nevertheless, this movie still provides a credible story about the effects of social isolation in an impersonal, hostile, violent, alienating and degenerate urban environment, which is the one thing that has NOT changed except for the worse, and for this reason is still worth watching.",

450,24 June 2017,alexanderdavies-99382,7, Not the classic everyone thinks it is.,"Martin Scorsese made far better films like ""Raging Bull,"" ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" and ""Goodfellas."" They have actual narratives and the plots make sense. ""Taxi Driver"" has a confusing narrative and the ending left me annoyed as it wasn't clear what the ending was meant to be! Robert DeNiro - who has made some good films - is well cast as the mentally disturbed Vietnam veteran who gradually loses touch with reality. The way he begins to come loose at the seams - psychologically speaking - is quite disturbing. Martin Scorsese's direction is very good on the whole. As witnessed in previous films from the decade, we are given a truly honest look at city life in New York. The dirty, trashy streets and the dirty, trashy people all contribute to the look of the film and also the way that Travis Bickle (DeNiro) views the world. The violence is explicit, which I except. After all, a film like ""Taxi Driver"" can't be glossed over with ""comic strip"" violence. What I don't particularly care for, is the language. It isn't difficult for actors to use all the 4 letter words they can think of and this partly defeats the film. I cringed on occasion at some of the foul language used and the manner in which it was intended. It is the climax that ultimately lets ""Taxi Driver"" down. Somehow, I doubt whether such events would have finished that way in real life. This is a misfire but an interesting misfire.",

455,16 May 2015,Sandcooler,10, Fantastic character study with a brilliant ending,"""Taxi Driver"" is a movie that thrives on the fact that anything Travis Bickle does is incredibly interesting. There's not much to the first hour, he just hangs around his apartment and occasionally drives a taxi. And yet, it's incredibly fascinating because there's so much suppressed rage in the character. You don't know what to think of him, but somehow you do know it can't go well for very long. When everything goes to hell you get a fantastic and pretty unpredictable ending, but it's the suspenseful build-up that really makes this movie a classic. Bickle is slowly driven to the edge by this filthy town full of whores, robbers, killers and Harvey Keitel with a stupid hat. You never know how he's going to react to a certain situation, which makes the violent outbursts very effective. In ""Taxi Driver"" Scorsese has very much the same style he was developing in ""Mean Streets"", but it seems like he has a lot more to say here. A truly unique movie by a director at the top of his league.",

Not only is it a masterclass in how a story should be told however it is also a remarkable character film as well and that is all because of De Niro's iconic performance. From his mannerisms, to his dialogue, everything that he does is incredibly breathtaking to watch and sets the standard for how a character performance should. Also a stand out is Jodie Foster. Foster, now a movie star in her own right, makes great use of the screen time she is given.

471,3 April 2016,Screen_Blitz,10, A stunning masterpiece by Martin Scorsese,"Martin Scorsese has made a name for himself in Hollywood, and with his directorial efforts in the classic films like 'Raging Bull', 'Goodfellas', and 'Casino', it's not hard to see why. Scorsese is a man with a God-given talent in directing and writing, especially those pitted in the crime genre. This bleak crime-drama starring his most collaborator Robert De Niro is the film that really put in Scorses in the cinematic spotlight during the early years of his career. De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a mentally disturbed Vietnam War veteran living in the crowded streets of New York City. In the efforts to deal with his insomnia, Bickle takes a full-time job as a cab driver. Along the way, he meets a political campaign worker Betsy (played by Cybill Shepard) who he develops a relationship with. On the night of a botched date, their relationship fails to work out. Even worse, Bickle grows increasingly disillusioned by the crime and corruption in society, and he learns of a 12-year old girl named Iris (played by Jodie Foster) being a sex slave of a local pot-smoking low-life named Sport (played by Harvey Keital), Bickle decides he must take matters into his own hands and make a stop to his madness.

Being considered an indisputable classic, Taxi Driver has spawned considerable talk and speculation among audiences, mainly in regards to its violence, fabricating the film a reputation similar to that of an intense action thriller. But any viewer who sees Taxi Driver and dismisses it as a thriller has completely missed the point of the film. Taxi Driver is by no means an action movie fraught with gratuitous violence, nor is the violence the centerpoint of the story. It is the study of a very lonely man, isolated in a world of filth and corruption, and his struggle to overcome it. ",
476,30 December 2006,xredgarnetx,8, An ode to the lonely and deranged,"Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER is an ode to the lonely and deranged, in this case a NYC cab driver named Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro). A Marine veteran and insomniac who is under heavy medication, Bickle is working up a head of steam about life in the jungle -- and NYC in 1976 was definitely a jungle, which the film's cinematographer captures perfectly. Bickle purchases several guns from a shady dealer and decides to kill a presidential hopeful, primarily because an aide to the candidate (the young and fetching Cybill Shepherd) has spurned his advances. What comes next is right out of a fairy tale. Without giving it away, let us say Bickle becomes a hero instead of a villain, like that nutcase Bernie Goetz who blew away his would-be muggers on the subway. Ah irony. This early Scorsese flick is really a showcase for the incredible talents of DeNiro. It also features a very young Jodie Foster as a cynical prostitute with whom Bickle becomes enamored. Foster won an Oscar for this role, as I recall. The film is dated by necessity. Much of what is on screen is now gone, passed on. Times Square was a cesspool when this movie was made, not the DisneyWorld extension it has become. Nevertheless, TAXI DRIVER remains extremely watchable, mainly because of DeNiro's intense performance. Harvey Keitel in a bizarre wig and hat has a small role as Foster's pimp, as does Peter Boyle as a fellow cab driver.",

479,2 April 2016,sharky_55,10, The papers always blow these things up...,"Bernard Herrmann's score for Taxi Driver has two distinct, recurring elements to it which Rosenbaum call 'heaven' and 'hell'. The latter is that ominous, brooding brass heavy tune that pumps up again and again as the taxi glides through the darkness of New York City like Charon's ferry through the River Styx. It thuds and blares in time with Bickle's heartbeat and pursed-eyed glare as he surveys the filth and scum around him - the city's terrors come alive in the soundtrack, hisses of machinery and auto-mobile, gusts of steam erupting from the ground, water whipping up a blurry haze from inside the taxi's POV. And the former is that romantic jazz influenced saxophone fill that feels like it could be plucked from Woody Allen's Gershwin-inspired love letter to his favourite city, but here it is steeped in irony. In the final sounding of this motif, the camera hovers over the 'happy' ending for Travis - the tiny little newspapers clippings branding his heroism, the narration of Iris' parents' gratitude, lingering on Betsy's admiring glances at the now celebrated figure. These two elements clash again and again like they are fighting for control of the narrative; Travis' own paranoia and disintegration of his mind muddle it further.",

Even after 32 years ""Taxi Driver"" is still an engrossing watchable masterpiece from start to finish. Robert DeNiro, Jodie Foster and Cybill Shepard give the performances of their careers and Marty Scorsese does an excellent job behind the camera to help symbolize the main characters isolation such as the phone conversation scene between Bickle and Betsy you notice that the camera suddenly drifts away from Bickle and shows something else but you still hear him talking. And that's what this movie's about, it's about how isolation can affect one's sanity, actions and their own perspective on things. Such as Travis' beliefs that everyone around is dirty, corrupted and weak and he isn't, he thinks he's God's only good guy and he thinks he's the only one who can clean it up, like he's the savior or something. Like I said, this guy is NUTS, completely out of his mind, and during the shootout scene at the end that's when he finally loses it.

492,2 January 2005,jegutierrezp,10, Taxi Driver VS. Chinatown,"I just ended to see Taxi Driver, I just say that is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, is an excellent portraying of that filthy, unsocially, vicious and decreased part of New York, with characters that used to live there and that are creating mean business, that we don't want to see, not only there, but also in my city, in fact, some of the society is identical to the poor parts of Colombia, especially when the black threw thinks to Travis and the taxi. Very psychological and suspenseful, Taxi Driver is not only a film classic, is New York. The second movie I saw form Scorsese (The first only was Gangs of New York, also a classic for me), and the first when De Niro was starting his long-living career, and Jodie Foster as well: Their performances were accurate and also their situations and conflicts. For the other hand Chinatown, directed by Roman Polanski, starring Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway, is the representative of film noir, descendant of The Maltese Falcon and Rebecca. Jake Gittes was that detective that is unhappy with the world, anyway, somehow, I saw that the screenplay was perfect: No mistake, creative and hard-boiling. Perhaps Robert Towne could be a writer for a lot of prizes. When I saw Faye Dunaway, I expected no less: She act like that femme fatale, but she doesn't begin as that, but she evolves into becoming a femme fatale, thanks of that father, daughter, sister and husband. The society of 1930s, portraying in Chinatown, was very perfect: It contains tha social life, tha customs and everything. ¡¡I expected less from that part, I deserved my surprise!! Corrupt politicians, infidel wives, lovers, criminals and anti-semitic. Perhaps many people, that already saw the movie, would say ""The romantic part was incomplete: It needed to be more influential inside"", or something like that, however I think different: The Film Noir contains un-sentimental love and promiscuity, and the part of love was that: It contained everything I read about the genre. Indeed Chinatown is another classic masterpiece, directed by another living legend: Roman Polanski Taxi Driver is film noir too. And is that society the one that expresses each one of the elements of film noir, and historical if we think about Vietnam War, speaking about Travis Bickle. For the other hand, it doesn't need too much for understand his mind: He hates his world, he feels he's better than anyone of them, and he thinks he is some think of hero, trying to save society form itself: He's totally insane. I recognize I'm not very specific with some elements of these two movies, but I prefer to bring you a synopsis about what you are about to find out rather than explain you the details.

The things that just didn't sit right with me is why he brought the girl to the porno theater. Yah he might be a crazy mentally disappeared guy, but he still should have the common sense to not take a girl to a porno film. That part just drove me crazy. The second issue I had was how the hell did he survive that ordeal when he went in to free Jodie Foster character, and if he did survive how could they let him back into civilian population. Just didn't make sense to me. There were some positives I like all the POV shots and for a color film. I thought they did a great job of lighting, and all though i didn't understand De Niro's character I though he did a great job of making a believable crazy person.

Travis feels like he needs to save both the women he adores: Betsy is ""in danger"" by the world of politics and iris is in danger by all the gangsters around her. eventually he saves only iris from the world of crime, which seems logical but in travis's point of view he needs to do more, that's why in the ending Travis hasn't changed, he is still going to take matters into his own hands and it is question of time when will he ""explode"" again. scorsese, you nailed it again.",

507,28 September 2019,ofpsmith,10," ""One of these days a real rain will come and wash all the scum off the streets.""","Taxi Driver is a movie that a lot of people have talked about and for good reason. It's a properly good film, working superbly as both a character study of Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a mentally unstable Vietnam veteran with a plan to purge the wrongs in society, and as a testament to the rising crime rate and urban decay in New York in the '70s, the very same rising crime rate and urban decay that incenses Travis. Travis's journey is our plotline. At the film's onset he is seemingly unemployed and so, knowing the city well, goes and becomes a taxi driver. On a date with Betsy (Cybill Shepard) a pretty campaign worker with whom Travis is infatuated, she remarks that he is a ""walking contradiction."" And certainly this characterization is an apt one. When applying for the job Travis seems normal. A little awkward maybe, but nothing out of the ordinary. At least not too out of the ordinary. And his disaffection with high crime, prostitution, and garbage strewn about the city streets is one that many people can agree with. Even his goal of saving Iris Steensma (Jodie Foster) from her situation is a noble one. Martin Scorsese keeps the movie set in Travis's world view, a world view which never really changes. Travis's mental state and perception of reality don't so much change as they simply worsen. It's a very gradual shift so we hardly realize it's happening up until Travis makes a botched attempt to assasinate Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris), the presidential candidate for whom Betsy is volunteering. After that his massacre of a brothel, his final deluded attempt to clean up the city, is only natural. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor and remedy that.",

The brilliant and brave performances from Foster and Keitel is quite apparent, but its De Niro's portrayal of Travis Bickle's slow spiral into madness that is most impressive and will leave the viewer wondering whether he is a hero or a villain. Bernard Herrmann's score is hauntingly beautiful, and Scorsese makes the neo-noir style fit the film's overall tone perfectly in what should be considered his magnum opus. The Geekster's favorite movie of all-time. The film gets more and more intense as it progresses, paralleling how it gets better and better with each viewing.",

512,7 September 1999,Peach-2,10, Powerful.,"Taxi Driver is the perfect cinematic example of a lonely soul. Travis Bickle is so alone it drives him crazy. Bickle tries to understand everything, but can't figure out anything because his judgement is so completely blurred. Bickle's idea of a date is dinner and a porno film. Robert De Niro turns in one of the greatest performances of his career and Martin Scorsese is at the top of his form. Paul Schrader's script is deep with character development in the right areas. I find the most interesting aspect of Taxi Driver is the Bickle characters obsession with the women in is life. Cybill Shepard plays the Madonna and Jodie Foster is the underaged whore. It seems like Bickle treats each woman as the other, showing just how complicated Bickle has become in his self pity and loneliness. All this frustration causes Bickle to comprehend an act of violence, his first attempt, he chickens out. Then out of more anger because the first act of violence didn't pan out, the second attempt at violence is extreme and insane. Scorsese, De Niro and Schrader have created one of the most interesting and complicated films in cinema history. One of the great films.",

515,31 December 2022,ivanmessimilos,9, Defining movie for a reason,"The film that pushed Martin Scorsese among the greats. Almost everything here works at the highest level, and the trio of director - screenwriter - lead actor was especially respected. Although the film doesn't actually last long, it contains a lot of quality, I'm even sorry that it doesn't last a few minutes longer. It contains elements of a noir film through driving the streets of an ""unclean"" city and the intimate thoughts of the protagonist Travis. Mentally and psychologically tortured, discharged from the army, suffering from insomnia, I would say that he is a typical mental patient. And the city where he lives and works doesn't help him either. He wants to make some positive change, but either he can't or he doesn't know how. This is visible through the attempt to have a relationship with a woman who does not belong to his world. Finally, the biggest change comes when he decides to act ""locally"" rather than globally. Travis is a very complex person, positive and negative at the same time, it depends on how you look at his actions. Later in the film we can even understand why he does something, if not justify it. It may have been unfairly overlooked in the context of the Oscars, but that's why the film defined an entire decade, but also two great careers: Scorsese and De Niro, and announced one great woman: Jodie Foster.",

No matter how many times I watch the movie, and in whatever conditions, I never cease to be amazed at this movie, at its boldness, at the fact it exists at all. The '70s are my favourite era of film, both in American and around the world, and for me Taxi Driver is one of its most magnificent achievements, so many decades later still towering over many of that decade's masterpieces, so ahead of its time the tribulations of the protagonist still disturb modern viewers by how prescient and immediate they are.",

I wanted to know what it was like driving a cab for one shift so I gave it a try. This was not the life for me. Belligerent customers and horrible tippers were the norm. Some patrons liked the air conditioning on high. Others made me turn it off. Impromptu traffic snarls and pot holes drove me crazy. Went to see this movie with my friend Neil during my college years and why not, It features violence, sex and foul language. Filmed on location in and around New York's majestic Manhattan streets, (displaying familiar landmarks) i.e. Time Square, Bellmore Cafeteria. But the main focus of the film exposes the underbelly world of prostitution, mainly sex trafficking. Sleazy hotels and rows of movie houses showing sex films along 42nd street of the 1970's. Conversely the film shows us the disconnect with the politics of the time featuring a political campaign. Robert DiNiro play Vietnam Veteran Travis Bickle who is basically a loner looking for employment. Travis lands a job as a New York City cab driver. The cinematography (Michael Chapman) is of excellent quality showing steam coming up from the streets as our yellow cab slashes through water puddles giving it a feel of realism. The camera gives you a sense of actually riding in the backseat of Travis's cab. I know like most passengers who have ridden in cabs, we focus on the meter as we watch the numbers tick higher as the ride progresses. I don't ever remember a movie featuring a taxi meter before. Basically you see the diverse cliente Travis picks up in his cab from violent pimps to a squeaky clean cut politician. Travis, though lonely, is bold enough to ask a extremely attractive political campaign staff member Betsy (Cybill Shepard) on a date which fails. Travis goes one step further in a different direction as he intercedes an underage prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster). Travis explains that this is no life for a 12 year old and that her pimp named Sport (Harvey Keitel) only has bad intentions for her. Iris is not influenced by Travis' remarks in the least. Travis takes matters into his hands as he purchases weapons and ads deadly devices to insure severe torture. Travis's loneliness manifests itself during the film with rage and anger. The mirror scene is an iconic moment in cinematography history. Travis (DiNiro), is the narrator. Travis voices his negativity about the city through most of the picture. The film predictably ends up to a crescendo of violence the viewer will never forget . Kudos for the musical background provided by Bernard Herrmann with ever present saxophone sounds throughout. Just one of those movies you just can't get out of your mind as it's value remains the same after all these years. A timeless piece from Martin Scorcese.",

The film was especially popular for the performances of Robert De Niro as a former marine veteran and Jodie Foster as a 12 year old prostitute, both of whom earned Oscar nominations for their roles. Though unlovely and inadequate in its motives, the best thing of the film is the picturesque depiction of hell of a metropolis including the gangsters and pimps. Besides, it stands an epitome of the period gained through the vivid characterization, which is to haunt your mind for a time. No wonder if you are a serious film buff, you will enjoy the ensemble of Hollywood talents in their early days including Robert De Niro, Jodie Foster, and Harvey Keital.

531,21 February 1999,scorsese-3,10, A tour de force by the brilliant Martin Scorsese,"Martin Scorsese establishes himself as one of the greatest directors of all time with the movie Taxi Driver. He examines, urban loneliness and despair through the character of Travis Bickle, brilliantly portrayed by Robert Deniro. With direct homage to the classic John Ford western The Searchers, Scorsese traces the events that lead to the release of a young girl being prostituted by a pimp named Sport. Similarly,in The Searchers a character named Ethan, played by John Wayne, is in a desperate search for his niece abducted by an indian named Scar. The main characters in both films are both lonely wanderers and war veterans. Travis's destiny takes a turn after an unsuccessful attempt to establish a relationship with a girl played by Cybill Shepherd. He subsequently purchases several guns, which symbolically represent phallic symbols through which he will ultimately release his suppressed sexuality. In the final segment,when he ultimately confronts Sport, he points the gun at him and says ""suck on this"". Then he proceeds on a bloody rampage to release the young girl, which metaphorically represents a cathartic sexual release for Travis. This scene is absolutely rivetting. The direction and the pacing throughout is impeccable.The mood is greatly enhanced by a superb score by Bernard Hermann. A modern masterpiece.",

533,18 April 2015,brianberta,9, Martin Scorsese's first masterpiece,"This was Martin Scorsese's first masterpiece and this was his first film which made him a famous director. It's about an insomniac taxi driver who works the late night shift because he can't sleep at night. It's a great character study showing him trying to fit back into everyday life. The cinematography is excellent and it shows the night life through the rear window of his taxi cab mirrors. The gradual transformation from man to beast in this movie is chilling. At first, he tries to kill a politician but then he turns his intention to a pimp who exploits teenage prostitutes. It's funny when he threatens himself in the mirror by saying ""You talking to me?"" but when he comes out with sunglasses and a mohawk hairdo, it's clear that he's going to do something nasty. Robert De Niro's performance is fantastic. It's clearly De Niro's best performance to date. His acting is very intense and it helped him make an impression. The movie is enhanced by an excellent jazz soundtrack by composer Bernard Herrman which draws people into the movie. ""Taxi Driver"" was a big hit when it first came out both by critics and moviegoers. It has been labeled as one of the best American films many times.

A near flawless panoramic view of one man's world and state of mind. Travis Bickle is an ex-marine who drives a cab in New York City. Soaking in the streets of the big city the sights and sounds of the great metropolis with its attendant hub of activity: noise, dirt, rude and bizarre individuals, violence, crime, he's equally dismayed and repulsed at the world around him. Disappointed in his personal life the harsh existence slowly gnaws in him as the ugliness of society gets into his head culminating in a series of events that lead to an end that's equal comedy, pathos and liberation. Robert De Niro perfectly embodies the lead character with his unhinged, wasted, weary, awkward, autistic-behaving simpleton personality who gradually takes the viewer into his steady descent into madness. The Big Apple is the perfect background to the dark and grimy flick mirroring its own decay and collapse at the time.

De Niro was robbed of the best actor award in the Oscars that year as was the film itself by Rocky, much as I love the Italian Stallions debut outing. This is a dark and murky character study of a sociopath and a loner who can't seem to find a way to vent his disgust at the world around him. It eats away at him until he finds some focus in a 12 year old prostitute, played excellently by Jodie Foster. Scorseses bleak and unreserved portrayal of New Yorks dark side is often graphic in visual and dialogue and often unsettling but the film is engrossing. It's full to the brim with darkness and pessimism about it's setting and it's central character who seems on a downward spiral until the end, when he finds some redemption thanks to Foster. De Niro is electrifying in a truly legendary performance, told mostly through De Niro's physical performance and telling a story through his eyes. Travis says little but we start to learn what makes him tick because of De Niro's brilliant performance. Also this has a brilliant and unique score.*****",

Unfortunately for me, everything that can be said about this movie has already been said, so I will simply say why I enjoy it. Apart from De Niro's performance, the violence is tackled well, without being glorified (remembering Bickle's reason for it), but without seeming over the top. Insomnia has never been more perfectly shown, and the imagery of the sleazy New York night life is gruesomely bleak. Unlike many films which try to bleak, or depressing for ninety minutes, then shove a twisty, happy ending in our faces, Taxi Driver leaves us with an ambiguous conclusion. Bickle is psychotic, which may or may not be his fault, and that does not matter. We do not know what is future will be. (If he survives that is, the final scenes may be a dream sequence)",

Cybill Sheppard, Albert Brooks, Jody Foster, Harvey Keitel and even Peter Boyle are props for DeNiro's epiphany.The jazz score makes no sense and Travis' date at the porn theater is almost out of context and these stand out as over-reaching, which has become a Scorsese trademark.

553,17 April 2008,jonathan-577,10, An impossibly complex cinematic colossus,"As a text, this thing is extremely hard to get a grip on. Surely we're not expected to empathize with this lovable cabbie's bad analysis about human scum and end times, and surely the catharsis that he gets from his rampage at the end is not supposed to extend to the audience (or to Iris for that matter - can you imagine how bored she is once she gets shipped back home?) But just as surely, everyone on set agrees that things are f*cked and there's not much else by way of a solution. These points are made all the time, by filmmakers as well as other thinking human beings, without baring the least insight or interest. The point here, drum roll please, is that this is an incredibly layered and vital piece of film-making, one that takes off in directions that the script can't even begin to imagine. Part of this is that the dialogue is treated as complete, abject banalities that don't come close to expressing what's going on inside the heads of the characters. These characters don't have the verbal tools to let their humanity out - especially on the big screen, there is just so much meaning conveyed by the eyes, between lines.

The movie presents honest brutality that doesn't pull any punches and features some groundbreaking directing from Scorsese.

555,28 January 2012,nickmesafilms,10, Taxi Driver (1976) - You Talking' to Me?,"Known as one of the greatest movies ever made, Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" is one of the timeless hit movies from the 70s, and it's one of the first movies to put a mark on the career of Scorsese himself. In his second collaboration with Scorsese, Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a mentally unstable Vietnam war veteran, now serving as a taxi driver in New York. Hallucinated by the world around him, the violence rages into his veins and is tired of what the world was offering to him. He even ends up helping a teenage prostitute, portrayed by Jodie Foster, in the process. The whole movie just focuses on his raging madness, on an unstoppable plan to murder the presidential candidate, and score back redemption. The full 113-minute running time is like a breath of fresh air. This is one of the most exciting, entertaining, and exhilarating movies ever made. Robert De Niro delivers one of the best performances of his career, and he steals the movie in every scene he is in. Jodie Foster also makes a pretty pleasant portrayal as Iris, a 12-year-old teenage prostitute. Rounding out the supporting cast is Peter Boyle, Harvey Keitel, Albert Brooks, and Cybill Shepherd, in a gorgeous performance as Travis' longtime crush. This casting ensemble is the ark of the entire movie. Starting out as your every-day drama, and ending as a wild and psychological thriller, ""Taxi Driver"" is quite a deserving motion picture. Martin Scorsese never disappoints, and he's one of the finest directors in Hollywood. He made such a good job making a movie that has everything that it wants to be. A script with some chills, a cast with some heart, unique cinematography and editing, a great soundtrack, and a thought-provoking ending. Now, there's a reason my moviegoers repeat the line, ""You talking' to me?"". Because this is the significant signature of one of the greatest movies ever made. ""Taxi Driver"", in my review, ""an exciting and thrilling crime tale"".",

After watching Taxi Driver, I must say, I have never been more disappointed by a film. I am struggling to find anything positive to say about it. Yes Robert De Niro's performance was good but certainly not his best. The film felt extremely slow-paced and boring due to the simplistic plot which was like a straight line - no twists, no fear, no emotion just utter boredom.

Nevertheless, Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader have zeroed in precisely on the urban angst that infects many and causes some to evolve their moral and religious beliefs into perceived righteous vengeance; the filmmakers create a climate of fear both seductively palpable and dangerous. Even though some of the politics might seem dated, the primeval impulses will always be relevant and these impulses follow Scorsese onward, from `The King Of Comedy' to `After Hours' all the way through to `Bringing Out The Dead'. A very bold--if flawed--piece of cinematic art. The clever, jarring jazz score is the last by the great Bernard Herrmann.",

You start to watch it with sky-high expectations and supreme confidence that you didn't waste your money on buying this DVD. ""Taxi Driver"" actually is that kind of movie which lives up-to such expectations. It's based on a wonderful story of a lonely cab driver who is virtually alienated from society, but with psychotic aspirations to be somebody. But his motivations for life were not in full bloom until he met a child prostitute and got determined to rescue her. Robert DeNiro is at his very best as the title character, Travis. His mental transformations throughout the film is brilliantly portrayed by DeNiro. Young Jodie Foster is also excellent as the 14-year-old Iris.

Classics like Chinatown, Network and The Godfather toppled cinematic taboos by presenting the movie-going public with radically gritty and audacious stories of the darker side of society and human nature. In my opinion the most powerful and effective film to come from this influential movement is 1976's Taxi Driver, a timeless masterwork from the great Martin Scorsese, who takes no prisoners in telling the story of a disenfranchised soul on the tattered fringe of society, and he drags you shocked but mesmerized to the very end.",

Basically, a disturbed marine veteran becomes a taxi driver in New York, and tries to relate to other people while fighting feelings of anger and loneliness. What I love most about that movie is that, at no point does Travis (the main character) state he is feeling lonely/angry, and yet I got the theme instantly through the countless minute details that Scorsese and De Niro put into the film. Every aspect fits together perfectly. The cinematography/camera-work is gorgeous, smoky, and surreal. The Bernard Herrmann score is jazzy, and memorable from the repeated leitmotif used. The pacing is right on key, with no scenes feeling like they drag on, and yet no scenes moving too quick for me to grasp what was happening. The acting is, of course, spot on. The movie is uncomfortable, but in a good way. It forces the audience to enter the mind of a mentally disturbed character and to sympathize with that character, while still recognizing that his actions are wrong.

I was stunned by how substandard I found it, and made me realize that as many people as I've heard talk about how great a film it is, hardly anyone at all actually says they ENJOYED watching it. Just because something's bleak doesn't mean it can't be enjoyable; I'm sure you can all think of many films that fit both criteria (if you can't, go rent Saturday Night and Sunday Morning).  Not that there isn't a lot that's great about the movie, mostly down to Scorsese and De Niro, who both turn in extraordinary efforts. But--and the DVD version of the film helps point this out--the script is third rate (and could only have been written by a film critic), the story never really develops (the episodic format of the screenplay is an easy way out to avoid watching Travis Bickle's descent into anomie, instead we get to measure the regress by watching his hair grow shorter), and the other characters are little more than caricatures, as we never learn more about them (other than De Niro's and Jodie Foster's) after the first minute they are onscreen.",

What's even more heartbreaking to me is the fact that Travis Buckle is a smart, optimistic warmhearted caring person full of humor and how that sort of shrivels away the longer he is in his environment. I love how his taxi becomes a ghost like figure.

The movie tells a story about Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran who works as a taxi driver at nights. He is constantly disturbed by the life around him and that gets him mentally unstable. He thinks the streets of New York City are full of trash and by that he is referring to people, and all the injustice and corruption the world around him has. Bickle doesn't have any real friends and he starts to question his own existence, he is lonely and a complete outsider to everyone, failing to make any emotional contact with anyone.

Robert DE niro in the film is very thin, although a tired, but the real young, and very handsome, I really think so. His performance in the film is introverted, everyone will pile on the ambiguous smile, when a person, the face is expressionless.
Martin scorsese and Robert DE niro work together to create an image of the weary, the weary from the inside out.
Travis coming from the war, although young, she has experienced the vicissitudes of life, he is a man, driving a bright old cab ramble in the river, both white and black ghetto or what is shady area, he go through it all, so what happen maybe he want, good disturb his boring life, even if it is a bad thing, but what things didn't happen to him, so he began to find their own things to do.
He saw a woman, she was wearing a white coat, appeared in front of his mature grace, symbolizes the purity of never being polluted, he fell in love with her, even in the heart of parents also mentioned her, he ask her to have dinner, buy her she ever mentioned record, but they, after all, not a man of the world, so he make her office, was finally booted out.
Then she met another woman, and the first woman is the opposite, she was reduced to dust, pure and she did not come close, but young rebellious, unworldly. Instead of saving her the first time they met, he drove away, and because of that, he remembered him.
Then, for no apparent reason, he wanted to kill the President. He prepared everything meticulously, as if there was a blood feud with him, and every procedure was not neglected. When he appeared on the outskirts of the crowd with his new haircut, he finally externalized his weariness.
Travis, care about the process and the behavior of the to do a thing in itself, rather than the result of this matter, at the same time, he to the society at that time, although he is very dirty, very disappointed, but he shot the President's behavior is not disappointed at his record, want others to President candidate, so want to, just to think of Travis too radical, he was tired of everything, don't care who will run the country. So when he failed to assassinate him, he immediately gave up and went on to what he called a plan to free Ellis.
Before that he has met several times, and Ellis his righteousness is words to advise Ellis to stop working in the same, really is persuasive, but Ellis is not brought his affection, she also don't think what's wrong with the present life, she was immersed in a pimp false tender feelings sweet meaning, it's hard to imagine that Ellis will hold such a strong sense of justice. Perhaps Travis simply saw Ellis' makeover as another way to pass the time in his life.
He acted after the assassination of the President.
Just borrow one and kill them all. I've heard a saying before, the timid are afraid of the bold, and the bold are afraid of the desperate. Measured by this standard, Travis is undoubtedly the most terrible what kind of person, he doesn't care about being hit, the reason why he escape is before you want to hit all the others, so when all the gunfire stopped screaming only Ellis, Travis lifted the pistol, aimed at his chin, successive a few trigger, if there were bullets in the gun, Travis early die, but god don't let him get a bullet didn't give him the rest.
When the police arrived, Travis smiled as he watched them raise their bloody left hands to his temple and pull the trigger.
Maybe the world is too ridiculous to be taken seriously.
Travis has experienced the cruelty of war, with the exhaustion of body and mind to leave the battlefield, the war only bring pain for him, but I did not bring any honor, when he USES the bloody and violent to defeat their spiritual emptiness and tired, when he put all the order and the moral principles behind, but fate and he opened a joke, let him be the hero of media coverage, won the appreciation of people, after all this, Travis, can not think how ridiculous.
After the injury healed, he was discharged from the hospital, his hair grew back, he started driving a taxi again, and his life was on the right track. Perhaps after this, Travis was completely relieved.
When he met the girl he had been attracted to, he looked at her in the rearview mirror. She was still very bright and attractive. Yes, seeing this movie, I couldn't help but doubt the credibility of the type printed on it every day.
He politely talked to her about her support for the President without looking any different, as if he had completely forgotten that he was about to assassinate him. He never tried to ask her out for dinner or a movie until he took her home, because he knew she had a good taste and would turn up her nose at the porn she liked.
She stood in front of the car bent over, hesitated, as if to say something, but the words, the absence of a completely different, how much?
As soon as the words were out of their mouths, they completely replied to each other, crossed off everything in the past, he smiled, said a goodbye, and drove away. Leave her behind, with a slightly wistful expression. This time, it's really goodbye.
I believe that Travis will never kill anyone again and will never fall in love with anyone again. He is just in front of his taxi driver and only has the relationship of money and interests with all people. He is not afraid of anything.

589,6 February 2002,Dragonsouls,10, DeNiro's second best performance of all time.,"Haunting, chilling, disturbing, and simply great film making. For a low budget film, Taxi driver delivers, and only a great director in Martin Scorsese can accomplish that. Robert DeNiro steals the show, his portrayal as a vietnam vet who slowly loses his mind due to the terrible things he witnesses day in and day out. He can't sleep, and everything seems to bother him, especially Newyork City's dark, hell on earth atmosphere which is actually the way it was back in those days. I almost felt as if i related to DeNiro's character personally in this film. I myself sometimes get so fed up with politics and drug dealers and pimps abusing young prostitutes, the crime, etc. Newyork is always exaggerated as a hopeless hell on earth in Scorsese films, but it is a very stressful place to live in and It could be depressing at times. (but i love it here too much, and will never leave) but besides that, this movie so great, DeNiro was only better in one film (the Raging Bull) in my opinion he was at his best in that movie, the way Pacino was in Scarface and the Godfather. Also, the soundtrack in this film is haunting and adds to that psychotic feeling that is going on in DeNiro's head as the movie progresses. Overall i rate this a 10 out of 10 **** 4 stars",

A lonely trade for a very lonely individual who spends the nights travelling through the scum and filth of New York's seedy underbelly seeing prostitutes, crazed patrons etc. This line of work only feeds Travis's contempt for society slowly driving him into insanity. Along the lines he meets up with a very young Jodie Foster who portrays a young prostitute named Iris.

598,20 June 2016,imbluzclooby,8, A grim and depressing character study,"If you don't mind watching the inner recesses of an unhappy and mentally deranged man closely and unflinchingly then Taxi Driver will serve as the best film to offer as such. I never read Paul Schrader's novel and I don't believe it has to be a prerequisite for appreciating the content of Taxi Driver. Martin Scorcese, one of our legendary and best directors of our time, is reliable and competent enough to be faithful to the novel. And he doesn't fail. Thus follows the drab, difficult, sad and paranoid life of ex-marine, Travis Bickle, played by none other than Robert Deniro. This is the young Deniro, lean, hard and wiry. We don't know much about Travis other than he's been honorably discharged from Vietnam services within the past two years. He suffers a bit of PTSD due to his withdrawn and socially inept personality. He doesn't have any friends nor family apparently and just hustles as a New York Cab driver. I remember first learning about Taxi Driver at the time John Hinckley made the assassination attempt on President Reagan. There was a parallel with that story and Hinckley was inspired to carry out his insane plan to no avail other than being pilloried as a mental case worthy of ridicule and scorn. But I hadn't watched Taxi driver till I was in high school and didn't grasp all the details. Perhaps anticipating the long awaited violence to the end didn't satisfy my young appetite for the gratuitous. But Taxi Driver, despite its unappealing continuity, is a masterpiece. it's a cinematic masterpiece due to our brilliant realized performance of our main actor and the meticulous direction of Scorcese.

606,3 July 2006,ekisest,9, arguably DeNiro's second best screen performance,"In the seventies, Robert DeNiro was scoring one great performance after the other, under the direction of such masters as Coppola, Bertolucci, Kazan and, of course, Martin Scorsese. In ""Taxi Driver"" he achieves, in my opinion, his second best performance next to ""The Deer Hunter"". The whole film is about his character, really. This haunted taxi driver haunts the spooky streets of New York City every night, like a ghost summing up those tormented souls that ""came home"", from Vietnam. The camera captures the interior world of Travis - where the usual nocturnal ""fauna"" becomes a gallery of zombie-like, crawling creatures - while filming the surroundings in which the characters evolve. Scorsese superbly directs the young Jodie Foster and also, the beautiful Cybill Shepherd, whose performance was ignored by many critics raving about Foster. This atypical American film was awarded ""The Golden Palm"" at Cannes while Tennessee Williams was presiding the jury. The famous playwright must of found some truth in Scorsese's vision, right?",
607,19 November 2019,thedarkhorizon,7, We dive deep into Travis view upon society... how's a mad man made? (spoiler alert),"In depth dive into a 'mad' man's mind. Strong camera angles and movements follow our protagonist into the wilderness of the night. We stay with him behind the wind shield as he glides into the jungle of prostitution, drugs and colorful neon-lit darkness. Great imagery illustrates his view onto the world...
his anger is unpredictable, the movie is not an absolute view - we follow an anti-hero closely (there's rarely a frame without our main character). Traumatized by his previous life (Vietnam war), he fights to find a place in the world surrounding him. He fails with Betty, he struggles to save the Prostitute Iris - his anger and sense of misplacement try to find a source he could aim it to... and finally he kills (and get's killed) in a final shoot-out in the bruffle where he found Iris, trying to save her from the pimp who (as Travis thinks)holds her back from happiness... and from him.
We dive in slowly into his word, his world get's disarranged piece by piece - and slowly we begin to see his true needs, desires and objectives. Great narration techniques right from the start!",
608,29 August 2016,bahramrasti,10, Character study of the main character of Taxi driver in a glance.,"Scorsese has made plenty of great movies in the past. In recent years he made few good ones as well and hopefully he will continue to do so in The future. Taxi driver is one of his earlier work to mark his visual style as an author. Together with his main actor 'Deniro', he manages to create an underdog character in a post Vietnam New York city and tackles on some psychological aspects of his main character. Scorsese invites us into the mind of his unconventional and non stereotyped character and made him as believable as sympathetic. In this movie we are faced with Travis's gradual shift in his sanity. Scorsese manages to make Deniro's character in a way that it's hard for the viewers not to sympathize with his. One should also give Deniro credit for his abilities as an actor. It seems that the director and the main actor understood each other well and had the same goal in mind in respect to Travis's mental state and motives. I recommend everyone who is interested in art of filmmaking to view this movie deeply.",
609,29 August 2003,chvylvr80,8, Yet another Scorcese masterpiece,"Martin Scorcese is one of the world's most talented directors. If you're reading this review then you know this already. This is one of his earlier efforts but that doesn't mean that this film lacks power or quality. It's a shame that more movies aren't like this. Robert De Niro plays the Anti-hero Travis Bickle, the typical everyman, with skill and intensity. Jodie Foster shows her early acting chops as a prostitute that Travis fancies. The city of New York in the 70's is practically a character in the movie and is shown in all it's gritty glory. Travis grows tired of watching the human scum polluting the city get away with everything and decides to take matters into his own hands. The result is a view of the transformation of the character that De Niro handles with aplomb. The movie deserves all the kudos that it gets in the media and is well worth viewing. Bottom Line: You can't call yourself a movie fan and not have Taxi Driver on your shelf. Movies this good are rare and worth appreciating.",

611,11 April 2007,film_riot,10, Taxi Driver,"This was Martin Scorsese's major breakthrough. For me it's interesting to look at this film, because I always thought, that his style changed a bit around mid-till-end-80ies. Recently I've seen lots of his newer movies, so now it was similar to seeing ""Taxi Driver"" for the first time, because I almost had forgotten how absolutely unique it is. This might be the definite film about loneliness and isolation, in its style it is defining urban film-making. It's paradox that surrounded by an uncountable crowd of people, people can cut themselves off and fall into biggest isolation. Travis Bickle is a deeply disturbed man, but ironically in the end he becomes a hero, whereas he could easily have become a murderer of the next president. Paul Schrader's script is close to life and full of tension. Scorsese's direction is extremely vivid (as are the colours of New York in this film), and full of great stylistic ideas. Robert De Niro's acting is outstanding. Bernhard Herrmann's music is romantic and threatening. A perfect film.",

However for those who didn't I would say that this Duo has given us hell of the movies and Taxi Driver is from one of their earliest collaborations. As 90's kid looking DeNiro that young was itself a treat. Travis a nightshift Taxi driver having insomnia, more specifically a Psychopath yet charming indulging himself into scenes and totally go nuts out of nowhere are some of the characteristics of Travis played by DeNiro and he nailed it perfectly the iconic mirror scene 'Are You Talking To Me' is still one of the best scenes I've come a crossed till date.
Cybill Shepherd looked beautiful and looking at 12 years old Jodie Foster was such a delight playing a role of prostitute.

Its one of De Niro's best roles, his performance is so good that it sends shivers down my spine every time I see it. To anyone who hasn't seen the film, De Niro plays a character called Travis Bickle, a man who takes a job as a taxi driver having been discharged from the army. It is through this job that he becomes disillusioned by all the crime and ""filth"" he sees around him and decides to take matters into his own hands. He is a challenging and multi layered character that De Niro brings to life with huge success. He may be a very extreme depiction of loneliness but even so he still seems every bit as real as you or me, he is a likable character to whom most people will be able to relate. That's the real genius of De Niro's performance; he makes you believe in Bickle no matter what he does.",

Robert De Niro is outstanding as the titular anti-hero. Driven to insanity by the rejection of the unobtainably beautiful Cybill Shepherd, and intent on saving child prostitute Jodie Foster, De Niro's mentally unstable Travis Bickle is the exact type of morally ambiguous character that becomes an insane murderer to some and a martyred hero to others. It is a difficult and risky maneuver to ask audiences to enter into the world of such an individual, but De Niro and Scorsese never make a single wrong turn in their attempt to provide an understanding, nonjudgmental view of such madness.",
620,25 August 2021,Kooozey,7," Good, but slightly overrated and superficial","To me, Scorsese's movies lack emotional depth. They never make you really care for any of their characters, you're never able to feel their sadness, their desperation or their joy and even a movie like taxi driver which is supposed to be a character study suffers from this unwillingness or inability to create and depict emotionally realistic human characters you can actually feel for. If you take a girl to a porno theater on a first date you gotta be an imbecile. It's just too much. Why would I care about someone like that? Similarly, his sudden delusion, that he's now working for the government is not believable in the slightest. The little girl would have been an opportunity to show real human desperation and sadness but Scorsese's not interested in that. All he's interested in is ""tough guys"" who ""freak out"", which is why his movies mainly operate on a surface level. That part is actually well done but it's hardly more than sensationalism. Personally, one-liners like ""You talkin' to me?"" don't do that much for me. Is this really what ""movie history"" is supposed to be made of? It's quite hollow. Also why doesn't Bickle go to jail after what he has done? It's simply not realistic at all. What's left is a movie about someone ""losing his mind"" in an entertaining fashion, who maybe even shows signs of sadness and despair for a second like a real human being would, but who is mainly just there to shoot people. My guess is that Scorsese would never be able to make an interesting film about someone who goes insane but does NOT end up going on a killing spree. It's a gimmick that seems to be absolutely indispensable to him, which says a lot about him as a filmmaker. Decent movie but not anywhere near to being one of the best.",

Speaking of storytelling it's probably my favorite part of the film you see travis doing day to day activities and you just feel how isolated he is from others he's very awkward and struggles to socialize properly at times which definitely can feel relatable to some, also making travis narrate his diary entries is very smart as you geta deeper look into his mental it's one of my favourite aspects of the film. My main gripe with the film is that some of the dialogue feel a bit out of place or too awkward or too weird especially in the first act of the film which is a bit of a bummer since it's personal favourite part of it, other than that I think the movie is great it has some very minor flaws but doesn't hinder the experience you will get all that much.",

No other filmmaker in history has captured the crime and grime and general ugliness of the mean streets with as much artistry as he has. Part of Scorsese's genius lies with his ability to create powerful and lasting art while featuring unlikeable characters at the core. Timing was a factor working in his favor ever since censorship restrictions were replaced by a ratings system in the late Sixties. Classics if his such as MEAN STREETS, TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL, and GOODFELLAS would never have worked during the days of the Hays Office because the sex, extreme violence, and profanity would have been banned.",

In the film you feel the agony and frustration of Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle as he descends into madness towards the violent bloody ending. Jodi Foster as the young whore (Iris) seems to take a liking to Travis but does not seem to be interested in being saved from her life by him, or from her pimp played by Harvey Keitel. Keitel and Foster seem to share a bond, however perverted, that Travis does not seem to understand. Travis lives a life of fantasy of talking to himself in the mirror and seeing himself in dreams as some hero when he saves or thinks he saves Foster from her pimp. The ending of the film does portray Travis as a hero but again is it real or just a part of his fantasy? The only thing with this movie is the part played by Cybill Shepherd. She plays the part as a woman who works for a Senator running for President and seems a bit too high class to accept a date from a poor grungy Taxi Driver. In any case still a classic film....",

The themes you can see in this work are numerous; it is angry and political, it is visceral and controversial, the character study it presents is razor sharp in its precision. De Niro is studied and scary, truly on the edge and taking the audience with him, a perfect anti-hero, and Scorsese drives another knife into the belly of the Hollywood machine with an anti-saccharine vision, which is bold, shocking, and uncensored in a way that may not have been so easy nowadays.

He develops an infatuation with a woman he sees across the street and befriends a girl prostitute all within a span of time, which pretty much tells you his state of mind. To put it bluntly Travis is a sociopath- a volcano waiting to erupt.

The cast is one of the best that has been Put to film With Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle is one of his best roles in his career and it shows also in the cast is a young Jodie Foster As Iris who is a child prostitute who at first does not care for Travis but in the end i think that she works out Travis was the first person to look after her and she was almost the only one who excepted Travis for who he was. also in the cast was Cybill Shepherd who was Betsy who was a possible love interest for Travis and while i think that in the begining and until the end scence with Travis in the Taxi she never really got him and the lack of understanding ment that travis became distant to her and doing more to try to recive the attention he wants and yet i never thought that she was ever intersted in Travis and she was in the end the character who would never truly understand him also special mention to Leonard Harris who played Charles Palantine who was the sterotype of all politions of the 70s and he only cared about in the end himself and even though i think he was interested in how Travis ticked he was a minor character who was symbolic in the sense that Travis admired and in a way hated him and that is the outline of politions of that decade.
Taxi Driver is defiently Martin Scorsese's most bold movie that made an impact and that was obvouis with the outline of the movie but also in a way it was showing that if a person spends too much time alone they can go insane and eventually Travis becomes a hero but at what cost he does so much damage trying to clean up the New York streets that you don't relise that while Travis has a sorta crazy way of doing it and yet you know what he is going to do so in a way he is the ultimate anti hero and is story is one that while being filled with sadness will tragicly beautiful and another special mention to Bernard Herrmann who composed the theme for Taxi Driver and it is amazing and it fits the tone of the movie in it's intirety and in all ways it's perfect and so is the movie and if you have not seen it it you have to you will not regret it",

When I watch it a second time, that is, straight after watching it the first time, I start to understand what and why the film is so great. It is kinda hard to explain it in a few words, but the movies done back in the 70s is alot different from the ones done nowadays. There is depth in this film which is not found in many modern films. For example, nowadays, if you want to film a overhead shot like in the last scene, we can simply use computer technology. But what they did was actually punch a big hole in the ceiling to put the camera! The camera work is done very nicely but you may miss out its brilliance if you do not know what to look for. For example, in the beginning when DeNiro was in the Taxi Company, the camera scan him watching on the right and it doesn't follow him but rather do a circle around the place and catches back with him when he leaves the door.",

I got weird vibes from him in the beginning, then I hated him because he was creepy, then I realized he's a pretty good guy and I started to like him, then I was back to hating him because he was weird and kind of a jerk and really getting crazy when it came to Betsy and then Iris. In the end, he is the creepiest yet the most self-sacrificing, thoughtful character I've seen portrayed.

Bickle is a mysterious figure who applies for a taxi position, because of his long bouts of insomnia. He is a former marine, honorably discharged, and is distrustful of blacks. The taxi is Bickle's vessel of loneliness. His interaction with humankind is the meager conversations with cabby clients and the small talk with other taxi-drivers.

692,6 December 2001,AdFin,10, `How long have I been driftin' alone through the night' - the defining scene of this film,"One scene above any other defines what Taxi Driver (1976) is all about, many of the scenes of the film have been talked about and mulled over in order to understand just why the film is as important and powerful today as it was when it first hit the screens back in the mid seventies, but no other scene taps directly into the pain and emotion the character is going through. The scene in question in the scene in which deranged cabbie Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) sits in his filthy apartment, shirt undone, magnum in hand, captivated by an episode of ""American Bandstand"", the barrel of his gun aimed at the young, predominantly black dancers. The obsession and the pain on his face, not out of blind racism as others have commented, but out of jealousy, the fact that the young couples are together and happy. Travis watches the scene alone, his attempt at a relationship with Betsy (Cybill Shepard) pretty much none existent, his loneliness becoming uncontrollable. This scene takes place (if I remember correctly) shortly after the scene in which Travis shoots the robber at the convenience store, his anger and mixed up sense of redemption are seemed to be momentarily healed by the violence, the sense of purpose the almost vigilante assault instated upon him. This is a turning point in the character's life, the calm before the storm if you will, and the music makes this message all the more clear. The words of Jackson Browne in his song ""Late for the Sky"" (""How long have I been drifting alone through the night""), of course Travis is going through as stage of self reflection, the song continues - ""Awake again I can't pretend/And I no I'm alone/And close to the end""... Travis is at his end, he can't take any more of the insomnia and the self-hatred that will all be released in the cathartic blood bath at the final, this is the scene in which Travis finally makes up his mind to go ahead with the ""bad ideas"" that are rolling around in his head. This is the reason Taxi Driver looses none of it's power after nearly thirty years, the character of Bickle has something everyone can identify with, who hasn't felt more alone in the biggest city imaginable, Travis isn't mad, he's just been pushed too far by his feelings, his want to be ""someone"" more than the average Joe on the street. Plus the structure of the film works fantastically with Paul Schrader's writing, the continuity changes in Travis' hair style means we have no idea just how long a time period the film takes up, Scorsese's use of repetitious imagery as Travis cruises the streets in the yellow cab, bring home the mundane-ness of the job, his street level photography and composition, as both writer and director trick us into following this at first eccentric and charming character, into one of the most furious blood stained finals ever committed to film. Taxi Driver is till the best representation of loneliness and urban alienation we have ever seen, and in these less than cynical times, may ever see again. 10/10",

Even the famous line 'you talking to me' is actually done better in parodies than in the actual film. Overall this film has a good concept but just doesn't deliver I believe if it were to be remade it could be a top movie as the idea is fascinating.",

So DeNiro meets Scorsese, Scorsese meets DeNiro and one of the greatest movie bonds are formed. In this movie DeNiro portrays a psychotic taxi driver who is trying to turn his life around. he meets a girl (Jodie Foster) who is indeed a prostitute, and they fall in love so now the pimps are getting mad and this causes DeNiro to enrage which inevitably causes him to kill and become the man he did not have to be. It is indeed a slow pace movie but portrays New York life style beautifully and is on of Scorsese's greatest achievements.",

for stirring aspirations in you, not to own and seize, but to be and decree. In that context, people at the fringe play the most pivotal role
in bridging the two contradictory worlds of stardom and boredom--an
imperative in human society if movies have to be used as a distraction
and a lesson at best, rather than a tool to fob onto that same society

dialogue from 'Gangs of Waseypur', that translates into ""As long as
cinema exists, people will persist at being arses"". The chief protagonist, evidently at a loss for having to revive from a pestering past, takes solace in the tales of all and sundry, finding solace in the prevailing pretext of movies of there being a hero in every common man. That stretches into basically the same thing, where out of a desire to transcend personal limitations, the common man latches on to the next opportunity of heroism at the doorstep of another victim of society, uneducated about that last movie that last Taxi Driver watched on his way to self-perceived redemption from self-perceived peccadillos.",
705,7 December 2002,tlarry858,6, The film's claim to greatness is fatally marred.,"Director Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976) is a famous, if somewhat infamous, film.  On the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest films of all time, Taxi Driver is listed at number 47, above The Third Man (1949), number 57; The Silence Of The Lambs (1991), number 65; and even Scorsese's much better film Goodfellas (1990), number 94.  Leonard Maltin (in Leonard Maltin's 2002 Movie and Video Guide) gives the film a less than perfect review.  Maltin writes, `To some, Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader's perception of hell-as a crazed taxi driver's vision of N. Y. C.-was brilliant.  To us, this gory, cold-blooded story of sick man's lurid descent into violence is ugly and unredeeming' (p. 1362).",

I don't dispute that De Niro is a great actor and Scorsese is a great Director. I just think this movie is extremely overrated. I also would add that Paul Schrader (writer) and Scorsese allowing Travis Bickle to survive the event at the end of the movie and become a hero seemed so contradictory to the theme of the story.

He develops an infatuation with a woman he sees across the street and befriends a girl prostitute all within a span of time, which pretty much tells you his state of mind. To put it bluntly Travis is a sociopath- a volcano waiting to erupt.

Recently, I have looked more positively upon their congealed phlegm and realised that they had it right: Taxi Driver certainly ain't one for the lasses.

He is unvilont, doesn't lash out or raise his voice, like he was uneffected by Vietnam. The odd thing is, somewhere along the line, he breaks down.

Travis tried to be like everybody (not to follow the crowd): without self-analysis and mentioning on bad things, indulging in an affair with a woman. Tried but failed. I think the last action he did hadn't pushed on him for his further violent actions but only confirmed his inability to be like others because of his loner and idealist being. This movie shows us two sided problem: on one side is society which cannot accept another individuality, on the other is individuality which cannot join society.

De Niro's performance as Travis is the best I've ever seen in a movie, he's able to be a very relatable person with a hint of insanity in him, to the second half of the movie being psychotic, but somehow still likable The rest of the cast did pretty good. Jodie Foster's performance as Iris was good especially considering she was only 14 at the time. I loved the way the movie was able to show nighttime New York. It made it seem very reasonable why Travis hates the scum in the city. The music in the movie, was just a glorious thing to hear, it was mostly the saxophone and it fit the way New York's atmosphere was set up really well. The way the camera moves and catches whats happening, the angles and all are another reason why this is a great one. Palentine is the fictional senator in this movie that Betsy, the girl Travis is trying to date, works for. Betsy is at first a very likable character, but as Travis starts to dislike her so does the audience, a very good feat in the movie. The part when Travis's psychology takes a turn is when he takes a passenger to watch his wife silhouette in another man's apartment. Its a very disturbing and unsettling scene in the movie, but it's also one of the most important moments, because you can tell from the way the passenger is talking about killing his wife with a 44. Magnum and how Travis reacts and looks, that the passenger had given him an idea. This is when the loneliness starts to turn to violence. After that Travis starts to build himself an arsenal. A very good scene is when Travis is buying guns from easy Andy, it's great because of the way it's all played out. Another great thing about the movie is how you slowly start to see what Travis's plan is . Until it's revealed that he's going to kill Palentine, the buildup to the assassination is extremely suspenseful, all the tension rises until, the assassination fails. Most people probably know that the climax of the movie is a shootout among Travis and pimps, and lowlifes to save Iris. It's a very violent and shocking part, for today's standards, I can only imagine what it was like in 76. ",
751,2 July 2003,jhmb2003,9, seven axioms about Taxi Driver,"Taxi driver is masterpiece because: 1. You can watch this movie like if you were listening your favorite tune. Again and again and again... 2. Travis Bickle is truly one of the most weird and consistent characters made in history of cinema. 3. Robert De Niro reaches the perfect work. After this movie he began to repeat himself. And all the performances are brilliant. Every character is unforgettable. 4. The music is another high peak. If you don't like this movie, you can enjoy the music. 5. T.D. defeats its own faults. Example: It has an unnecessary and weak epilogue and it's still awesome. 6. Scorsese melted his own style and gave us a guideline to enjoy his next masterpieces. 7. The story has a remarkable moral: Sometimes, Hell's path is plenty of good will and Heaven's path is full of evil. Good and Evil at random.",
752,26 February 2011,Sonic_Ocean,10, Classic,"First of all, Robert De Niro's performance as Travis Bickle blew me away. His portrayal of how loneliness and alienation can affect one's outlook on life is believable. An average happy person may think a person like Bickle is crazy, but this character is so relateable in so many aspects. From his tired voice to his emotionless eyes, it really gives a good view of how isolation in his life has worn him down. When you are isolated and alone, one has more time to develop a philosophy on different things, but at the same time boredom and redundancy can really take a toll on a person's mind. Everything about his portrayal of this character is iconic and memorable.",
753,4 January 2005,ulyssestone,9, Great lowlife film,"The most interesting thing I found in it is the tender scene of Sport and Iris. I still couldn't figure out what exactly does it mean. It came from nowhere and took a long time and Sport looked so full of true love and compassionate to Iris and even the entire human race! I think that's the most unusual element. And Martin Scorsese's madness is also interesting, maybe that's what persuaded the killer finally made up his mind. When Travis pointed his gun to the mirror and talked ironically to himself: ""You talking to me?!"" I couldn't laugh, on the contrary I feel sympathy for him, maybe myself too. Good movies sometimes are like a mirror that reflects our own weakness. And the camera-work is brilliant, as hypnotic as the jazz score, and those slow motions which show us what Travis see with his tired eyes recall the beautiful opening of the Last Waltz. This film also reminds me a lot of Joy Division's Love Will Tear Us Apart. A young man who suffered from the material world, tried many solutions but all failed (When routine bites hard, and ambitions are low, and resentment rides high, but emotions won't grow), then he decided to do something really usually (And we're changing our ways, taking different roads). But is he saved? The streets were still dirty and Betsy's smile couldn't move him anymore. (Just that something so good just can't function no more) Even Iris's fate is doubtful, she just disappeared and left only those papers on the wall. (Then love, love will tear us apart again.)",

757,16 March 2015,beardedmovieguy,9," Two words, De Niro!","Certain films are iconic in themselves or for certain lines, Taxi Driver falls into both categories. I have often heard it talked about and I could not even begin to count how many times I have heard people say the lines, ""You talking to me, are you, talking to me, you must be talking to me cause I don't see anybody else here."". So saying that, I finally got around to seeing it and I think it is a really good movie, probably not as great as everybody thinks it is, but overall I liked it a lot. De Niro does an excellent job as Travis Bickle, you really get the feeling of isolation while being in the middle of everyone, and the score and city itself really helps with that. If I was judging this movie on acting alone I would give it 5 stars, but due to the amount of swearing, the fact that Bickles idea of a nice date is to go to a pornographic movie and the child prostitution kinda makes it lose some stars, but I do understand some of that is necessary for the story. The cast for Taxi Driver was really good too, and I don't think I have ever seen Harvey Keitel look that young before. So overall Taxi Driver was pretty darn amazing, although I doubt Bickle would have survived with that many wounds, and if he did, I am pretty sure he would have been thrown in to jail for what he did, but what do you want, its a movie. 4.5 Beards Out Of 5",

764,19 October 2014,ferrellgarrison,9, 9/10,"Martin Scorsese's acclaimed film, Taxi Driver, provides viewers with an excellent example of a character study film done right. Through violence, sorrow, and disgust, the film is a one of a kind directed perfectly by Scorsese. Taxi Driver follows the life of a lonely and frustrated New York City cab driver, Travis Bickle, played wonderfully by Robert De Niro. Travis is a Vietnam vet now suffering from insomnia, and he takes a job as a night shift cabbie. As one would expect of late nights in New York, Travis is a witness of all types of sleazy late-night activities, such as prostitution and drug dealing. Travis begins to become increasingly frustrated with all the immorality and the direction that the world is headed in. His strong opinions and personality pushes most people away from him; he develops a short, and failed love interest with woman named Betsy, who works for the campaign of want to be senatorial candidate Charles Palantine. Travis becomes concerned with a twelve- year-old prostitute, played by Jodie Foster, and is determined to save her from her pimp. After all the desperation and frustration, a sense of self-righteousness develops within Travis, and he takes a course of action to try and make the world fit his mold of what an ideal society should be. Scorsese helps to show that a lavishly decorated movie, starring an exuberant cast of characters is not needed to create a widely acclaimed masterpiece. Scorsese's film featured a bleak and disturbing main character, and does not leave the viewer feeling happy upon finishing it, yet you cannot help but recognize its greatness. Taxi Driver shares many similarities, but it also has many differences compared to Scorsese's other works. Like many of his other films, the cinematography is arguably the strongest element of the film, and the awkward dialogue paired with Travis' internal dialogue creates a very unique film. The film also incorporates crime into it like many other great Scorsese films such as Goodfellas, and The Departed. Unlike the mentioned films however, Taxi Driver does not have any sort of mafia theme in it like a lot of Scorsese's previous works. In terms of characters as well, the characters in Taxi Driver are for the most part outwardly mundane and un-exciting. This film does not have wild and outspoken characters such as Joe Pesci or Mark Wahlberg from Scorsese's works, and instead focuses on the internal problems of Travis and the rotting of New York City. The social commentary of this film hits on two different areas. The first, is the psychological impact of the Vietnam War. While the film never makes clear that the reasons for Travis' insomnia and other psychological problems are related to the war, it does not seem too far fetched to assume that the war definitely had some sort of impact. The commentary tries to show the lasting pain and psychological problems the war had on its participants, and is most likely a subtle criticism of the whole war in general. In regards to the war however, the film's clear and main point is to show the negative and lasting affects of the experience on the returning soldiers. The other realm of the film's commentary has to do with New York City, at the time the movie was made. Taxi Driver shows the deteriorating state of New York and in some ways is a plea for help. Travis is obviously not the figure Scorsese wants to help fix the city, but he uses Travis to show the desperation that is needed for help. This film deserves a 9 out of 10 stars. The development of Robert De Niro's character from a frustrated cab driver to a wannabe martyr is acted out perfectly. The film does an amazing job of stirring up emotions despite the lack of overt emotion within the film. The viewer feels the pain and sorrow that Travis somehow manages to hide, and becomes frustrated when Travis does not realize the disgust of his actions. The greatness of the movie is in its ability to keep the viewer engaged when quite often, while at times the film seems stagnant The film's strongest element is quite possibly the cinematography. From the close up scenes, the moments of silence, and the score, Taxi Driver has the total package when it comes to cinematography. As many have said before, Taxi Driver features one of the best-shot scenes of all time. The scene where Travis is trying to make contact with Betsy on the phone and the camera pans over to a barren hallway is the one in reference. This scene is so great because you feel Travis' emotions, and when the camera goes over to the hallway it's as if Scorsese is telling the viewer to not look at the pain Travis is feeling. The barren hallway is also a metaphor for Travis' life as it is simply empty and lonely. The arc of Travis is another interesting element of the film. Travis' arc from a low life cabbie toward redemption does not feel forced and is developed in a way that feels realistic. By about the halfway point, Travis' desire to take matters into his own hands, in regards to cleaning up the city, begins to take action, and in his mind will lead to him becoming a hero. The third stand out element of the film is the conflict, and the films ability to create great external and internal conflict. The external conflict of the film has to do with the state of city which is filled with prostitution, violence, and other forms of crime. The internal conflict is Travis' own personal battle with his psychological problems and his loneliness caused by his off- putting personality. Taxi Driver does not feature any sort of explosions, quirky dialogue, or have a Hollywood ending, but is a film that can still be appreciated today. Taxi Driver holds up to the test of time thirty-eight years later.",
765,3 April 2004,btodorov,10, The murderous saint of New York's slums,"I do not see point commenting the technical sides of one of the best movies ever to have been made. I am just tempted to point out how much Travis Bickle fits the pattern of a Christian saint, a consistency in his character which deserves some thoughts. Travis is a loner as hermits are, yet subjects himself to strict physical discipline, as hermits do, leads a frugal life without any aspiration for luxury, as holy men do, stays sleepless practically 24/7, as hermits do, is obsessed with the idea of sin, stays out of the ways of the world (the episode with the jealous man who was vowing to kill his wife with a .44 magnum), yet in the next moment preaches salvation to young Iris, is both an outsider to the society he supposedly lives in (brings the beautiful Betsy to a movie couples watch to strengthen their libido because he has no idea what ""decent"" people watch), stands below the others (has limited education) like a humble holy fool, and often speaks like a holy fool, yet on other occasions stands above the people around him, up to an unattainable height (his bugging up Sport in the day scene or ridiculing the Secret Servce guy). In short, anything Travis does in the movie EXCEPT his short-lived dating affair with Betsy, fits the image of the saint which ""career"" he himself wants to bring to glorious martyrdom with the spectacular, and suicidal, assassination of the evil candidate for the presidency who stands apart from the problem of the slums.",

Taxi Driver was on the top of the list. A cult classic among De Niro and Scorsese fans, this dark noir tells of Travis Bickel (De Niro), a pent-up ex-Marine who takes the late shift driving a New York City taxi. Travis' long nights working in the seedy underbelly of the city begin to take their toll on him. Travis goes from a somewhat shy person, who asks out a young campaign worker (Shepherd) with the best of intentions, to a gun-toting madman. In the midst of his transformation, he befriends a young prostitute (Foster), who he feels somewhat compelled to try and save before the dark underbelly of the city swallows her up. All of this comes to a head in a fantastically crafted scene as Travis shoots his way past the young girl's pimp (Keitel) , the brothel's manager, and a client, all on his way to her room. As Travis sits there covered in blood, the camera starts to fade away from the room and the apartment building, police moving in.

The film is set in New York and it beautifully captures the crumbling social structure and racist themes that prevailed in the those times.

I spent the next hour with my kidneys aching from the adrenaline rush caused by the shootout.  I experienced more emotions throughout the duration of this film than I had in the past three months. Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader created a work of art, not just a film, that goes deep inside the human mind, or rather, what happens when it finally snaps.  Robert DeNiro is beyond a doubt the only person who could play Travis Bickle.  His performance in this film is by far one of the best ever; he certainly deserves his recognition.  Also, I was extremely impressed by Jodie Foster.  Even at her young age, her talent is more than apparent, it's almost disturbing.

790,23 March 2011,kargaan,8, Great Movie. Not Perfect,"Taxi Driver is a great movie but I don't know why its one of the top movies on IMDb. The story to my perception is that it's about a young guy who applies to be a cabbie to occupy himself. He suffers from insomnia and feels out of place. He's certainly an odd guy considering how xxx movies seem like regular movies to him. He's looking for more in life. A purpose. And he's got a lot of bad ideas running through is head. Then he decides to buy some guns. For what reason I don't know and I don't think he knows why either. He then decides to be some type of enforcer. But who to enforce? Jodie Foster plays a young prostitute who seems to be held back by her pimp keeping her from her family where she should belong. Travis then decides to free her with extreme force. So thats Taxi Driver in a nutshell. The movie is very slow but interesting and a dark movie at that. Despite some boring parts, the ending seems to make everything you've seen worth it. The final shootout is painfully realistic which is what makes it so powerful. The scene is quick, bloody, and gritty like a real firefight would be like. Taxi Driver is well directed but not as satisfying to me as it shoud've been for such a high rated movie. But you at least have to see it for the ""You talking' to me?"" scene.",

In the seventies, CITIZEN KANE was the absolute reference. If you check today, young directors all refer to TAXI DRIVER. It is the favorite movie of Lucky Mc Kee, Guillermo Del Toro, Quentin Tarantino. Everything is perfect in TAXI DRIVER : frames, lights, acting, music, and it has probably the best script ever written. No moral. No lesson. Just pure life, dry and harsh, with a series of cult scenes, from ultra-violence (the end) to pornography (the scene at the cinema), romance, folk music, social problems, populist politicians, racist things, solitude, hippies, family, etc. The all world is contained into Taxi Driver. I watch it once a month, and it reduces me to tears every time I see it. Every single scene is perfect. The all legend about the ""talking to me ?"" scene is quite easy to understand. The thing is, each time people mention it, they forget to tell it is not a macho scene, it is a very very sad scene, where De Niro, alone in flat, alone in his life says : ""who the hell are you talking to ? I'm the only here"". God. It touches you right to the heart. When De Niro, almost mute, can just say ""damn"" every time cause life has become impossible for him. Everything becomes an aggression to him : whites, blacks, politics, dirt, rain, drugs, prostitution, the world. Not only a movie about solitude : a movie about the world that contains multiple solitudes. The end refers directly to the supreme violence of Peckinpah's movies : blood is almost black, editing is quick and harsh, blam, blam, and you re see the entire story, so simple at the beginning, and you realize the entire script has been guiding you into hell, though you couldn't see it. No effects. Post Vietnam war. Dry. Super real. Travis Bickle, De Niro's character, is the entire humanity. His end might be yours. Damn.",

The soundtrack may not have any similarities in today's movies, but the values that are present are universal. The loneliness of the main character, the wrongs of the world, the alienation of modern life is all present in this masterpiece of a movie. By the presentation of the main character, it avoids all the usual clichés of cinema, which is a relief. The city that is portrayed in this film is one that is decaying, one that is covered by filth and dirtiness. The film's main appeal is its focus on the human desires, such as trying to find purity in impurity. This is evident in Bickle's (played very well by Robert De Niro) interest in Betsey. The ending of the film is one of a masterpiece, with well done shots, memorable lines. It's gusts is something to be admired, that when doing with a subject matter such as drugs, prostitution it should be met with grit and realism as opposed to gloss. It will forever be a universal film, not because of the performances or script (which did help), but the universal themes and Martin Scorsese's uncompromising directing style. A must see film.",

800,18 December 2012,ChristophCinema,9," Dark, disturbing, and bloody...Just the way I like it!","Taxi Driver is just an awesome movie. I can't really think of what else to say about it. It's an awesome movie, and everyone knows it. But what makes it so awesome? Well for me, there are a lot of things. First of all, Robert De Niro is always awesome. This was the movie that really kicked off his career, and he's what makes this movie. Second of all, I love how dark and gritty this movie is. I know there were movies in the late 60s and early 70s that were really violent, but Taxi Driver took it to the next level with its gritty cinematography, realistic setting, and amazing performances. This movie feels so real, that it's actually kind of disturbing. Just like Midnight Cowboy, this is an ugly movie, but that's where a lot the appeal comes from. Third, I love low budget movies that become iconic. It doesn't have the perfection and class of The Godfather movies, but that's what makes it so effective. The low budget look and ugly tone make the movie seem all too real, and not to far off from reality. It's actually very inspiring for anyone who wants to become a filmmaker. Fourth, it was one of the first movies to show the hardships veterans of the Vietnam War had trying to fit back into society (the dark tone of the movie emphasizes how tragic a thing it is for soldiers who have returned home). Soldiers who fought in the Vietnam War were often protested, so I'm glad this movie addressed how difficult it really is for them. Taxi Driver is just an all around great movie. It may be dark, it may be bloody, it may be a little too ""real"" for some people, and it may have almost gotten President Reagan killed; but if you're looking for a movie that defines awesome, then Taxi Driver is that movie.",

DeNiro plays the ultimate loner and violent psychopath in Taxi Driver, yet he displays enough charisma causing the viewer to care for this unsavory character he portrays. This is a rare feat for an actor to accomplish. Given Paul Schrader's screenplay refrains from resorting to manipulative cliché to generate sympathy for an unsavory main character like Bickle. Robert DeNiro deserved the best actor Academy Award for this film. ",

I'm saying this because I just think I'm not old enough to watch that movie. Or maybe is just that is not my time movie, or just that I really don't know what is the movie talking about. I'm not from America, and that may affect. I have to say that I just watched because Jodie is in the movie, and whatever she does is good.

I will say that this is one of the few movies I have ever seen that has so completely sucked me in upon viewing. I don't think I blinked during the whole thing. The pathetic Travis Bickle, a Vietnam War vet with a scarred mental state, is a loner who decides ""if all I'm gonna do is ride around nights, I might as well get paid"". The movie then sucks you into his descent from a maladjusted sociopath to a full-on homicidal maniac. The climax of the film might be the most brutally violent in screen history-but it makes sense because the entire film has been leading to the moment.

It showed this at a great pace, but the one thing I can complain about is that I didn't feel an emotional connection to Travis. He never really showed his feelings until the end. He didn't lash out before that. He got a little angry a couple of times but it was understandable and nothing drastic. However, he truly showed his hate and anger toward the citizens and actions around him. He would write in his journal about how this place needs to be washed away. He had great reasons to think so and it showed in the city around him. He didn't seem quite unstable to me until the end again, however. He just seemed like a normal guy who knew that what was going on wasn't right. Still, this movie is a great gripping drama and deserves a watch.",
807,22 July 2012,UnknownRealmsDotNet,9, Scorsese's break out film is a classic!,"Taxi Driver is Scorsese's breakout film. It is dark, visceral and haunting. Only his fourth film, this classic bears all the marks of a seasoned auteur. Intricately crafted shots, perfect timing, and on top of that, De Niro gives one of his most disturbing performances. Together they paint a portrait of a man slipping into insanity and his personal self-destructive fantasy. That said, I don't believe this film is as insightful as everyone says it is. I've seen in three times now and I can't understand it's 'purpose.' What is the point of this? Is Travis a representation of the angst filled youth (of the 70's era) -- wanting to change the world, but misguided in how they try? Is this a portrait of how isolation destroys a man? Is this a tragedy? But these ideas aren't overtly clear. Especially by the happy ending (how he is somehow turned into a hero). Only after watching documentaries with interviews with the creators did I understand their intentions with certain scenes. But like most creators, the writer/director here were so close to their art that they thought what they were doing was self-evident (when sometimes it wasn't.) The character Travis himself is not sympathetic, while even anti-heroes have some part of them that you can connect with, some part that makes you want to root for them. Maybe that's why it works. Taxi Driver is an unfiltered look at New York in the 70's. Most of the film captures this in such detail and finesse, it couldn't have been staged better (which many of the background shots weren't). And Travis is a dark portrait of a reject on the edge, pushed over by the madness of the city/society/humanity(whatever you want to call it), and this story has proved itself to be reality again and again since. This is a mark of accurate art. Maybe that is what Taxi Driver is.",

I feel that this film definitely stands out among other Martin Scorsese films in the way that the main character is developed; I feel that even though he was the protagonist, he wasn't a well-rounded character.

Generally I would not consider this movie to be my type of movie because of its gritty feel and psychopathic nature of the main character. I really enjoyed the film though, but was kind of confused at times by the decisions that De Niro's character made. Honestly the whole film and Robert De Niro's performance kind of made me feel very uncomfortable, especially by the end of the movie. But I think that is a good thing and also a great testament to the acting skills of De niro and the directing skills of Scorsese.

Martin Scorsese's use of point of view show the mind of the tortured Vietnam, veteran, Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro). The film is loosely inspired by John Ford's The Searchers. Paul Schrader's excellent script is obviously based on some of Dostoevsky's novels. Harvey Keitel is outstanding as the pedophile pimp. Martin Scorsese was not nominated for an Academy Award, but it is his best work. The movie was almost given an X rating for extreme violence. Jodie Foster as the 12 year old prostitute received her first Oscar nomination (best supporting actress). The film lost out in the Best Picture category to John G. Avildsen's Rocky.

I remember the, apparently authentic, scenes in the beginning of the film that show the streets and although very brief they create a sort of feeling of authenticity that sets the tone for the film. I remember reading that Scorsese had to use authentic footage because they ran out of money making the picture. ",
817,5 June 2018,aasthat-98209,10, Very Powerful movie even NOW! Best so far.,"I have seen this movie 3 times. Today when I watched it again, I was thinking what a wonderful masterpiece it is. I've always loved De Niro, not just for how handsome he is but how good he is at dialogue delivery and expressions. Also, other reason that I might be biased towards writing only positive comments about this movie is because of the director, Martin Scorsese. These two have never disappointed me in the work they do. 
Talking about the movie, which can be considered more about a story of a taxi driver named Travis Bickle starts with his little introduction that he served in Army and he is a Marine veteran. This introduction establishes a lot about why Travis behaved certain way in rest of the film. The way Scorsese has directed the movie by unfolding about Travis's character is just brilliant. You will learn so much about Travis's character that not just he hates all the filth in New York but also how the small things that he notices everyday during his job affects him. For example, the guy who sits in the taxi and talks about how he is gonna kill his wife and her lover for infidelity. All the loneliness in Travis's life, the filthiness around the city and his past encounter with violence make him want to go back to being violent.
Travis's life in the movie is shown to be very lonely. But, it's shown that he does like a girl and go after her. But, after she stops taking her calls. His dialogue that says a lot about how he feels about people, "" I realize now how much she's just like the others, cold and distant, and many people are like that, women for sure, they're like a union.""
Travis wants to save the world from that filth and it can be seen when he says ""Listen, you fuckers, you screwheads. Here is a man who would not take it anymore. A man who stood up against the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit. Here is a man who stood up.""
To sum up, the movie depicts urban alienation and loneliness very well with great acting by Robert De Niro. It shows how Travis starting as just a cabbie end up saving a child prostitute by killing some people and becoming the hero he wanted to be.",

Martin Scorsese has crafted a moody drama film set in his native streets of New York and the cinematography is sublime. It makes you feel uneasy because you are on the level of Travis.

He not only directed this film, but he also participated in the acting. We may not see him exactly in the film, but his silhouette is very good.

I think it was interesting to see, even though it was terrible to watch, the progression of a veteran go from attempting to be a normal man post the war, to a crazy man at the end of the film. The end of the movie was great when he goes on the killing rampage in attempt to save the young girl. The cops come in and there he is sitting on the couch, after getting shot in the neck and he puts his bloody hand up to his head, in the shape of a gun, and pretends to shoot himself over and over again.

Robert De Niro's character goes from annoyed and calm to chaotic and violent all in a matter of days/weeks. The taxi ride scenes were pretty cool when it comes to the use of the camera. I loved how the mirrors on the vehicle were used to show us scenery but also the people who got into the taxi. It made for a wild ride. I some ways it felt as if we (the audience) was in the back/passenger seat. The lighting was great too, though it was natural light it worked.

This movie actually surprised me. It wasn't my favorite out of all the other ones I've seen but the actual concept and process of going through the plot was well thought out. The perceptive of the main character is shown really well-showing how he's slightly lost his mind due to the war but still being down to Earth wanting to help people.

832,22 April 2015,MC_Barton,9," ""There's no escape. I'm God's only man.""","""Taxi Driver"" is not considered one of the greatest movies ever made for no reason. There are so many things that bear significance within the movie for the time, and even for now. The film takes place right after the Vietnam War, when the effects of the war was still prevalent among the community. Violence is a fixated them within the film, however it isn't unwarranted. The violence that Travis engages in is oddly judicial, acting as a vigilante he contends with the gripes of a corrupted society. The film sends a subliminal message, that violence and corruption have become an issue within our country. During the time this was no shocking revelation, but an apparent one. Citizens had lost trust for the government after being lied to countless times about information regarding the countries involvement in Vietnam, so it was up to the individual to do what was right essentially.

However, Travis was trying to do good in the messed up world he was a part of, and sometimes he got lost along the way. He was obviously experiencing some type of psychological stressor, most likely depression. The film did show a lot of ugly truths about the world we live in, something more people need to be aware of and realize- we do not live in a perfect pretty world. There are ugly things that happen even in our very own neighborhoods that we would much rather turn a blind eye to. Travis was almost unable to turn a blind eye though, because as a taxi driver, Travis is exposed to a lot of the raw world and people in it.",

This film we have Travis, a taxi driver. And one never really thinks about it, but we've all done or said something of a private nature with a sense of security when in truth we weren't alone. So a taxi driver, for example, anyone can hail him, so he has exposure to virtually anyone from all different walks of life and belief systems. A quote from the film is, ""People do anything in front of a taxi driver, I mean anything. People too cheap to rent a hotel room. People who want to embarrass you, it's like you're not even there. It's like, you know, a taxi driver doesn't even exist"" , and ""This city is like an open sewer. You know, it's full of filth and scum He's seen the worst of it. And he does this job everyday. He's had enough and sees a need for a change. When talking to Iris, a child prostitute he tries to save, when planning to assassinate a presidential candidate, where he says ""no"" to going with her somewhere, he says, ""Doing something for the government"". Because in hi eyes to create a better world, he is. This film's simple and thoughtful dialogue, reserve shots that interrupt speech, and close ups help tell it's story.",

Everything feels natural yet at the same time unsettling. This is a world we don't want to live in but we all live in it. We don't want to live in this world but we do and there's no escaping it. Thats exactly what Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) tries to do. He's not a hero, not by any means. This is an incredibly sick man who somehow manages to kind of maybe do something ""good"". The whole film is just twisted and unsettling. We watch Bickles decent into madness. DeNiro is perfection. He is so good in this movie. Harvey Keitel is brilliant in his smaller role as a pimp. Their scenes together are some of the best in the film. Even when DeNiro is alone his acting is incredible. The camera work is flashy but in a detached and bleak sense. Scorsese gives it his all.

Even in this day and age, much of these points remain true, and makes it almost ten times a more enjoyable flick, although it's definitely not age appropriate. Keep away from your children's. Somehow this film makes an extremely unreliable narrator, an insomniac taxi driving pervert to be a somewhat likable fellow. The night scenes are shot brilliantly and make it feel more like New York City for real, the freaks really do come out at night. Robert De Niro is brilliant in his role, but I need to understand one thing. Why does he shave his head? Why did he need a mohawk to gain the courage to go and fight the pimps and criminals, and then why didn't he keep it after all of that? I suppose it represents the changed side of him, but he was still a hero nonetheless afterwards. There still seems to be a disconnection between the meaning of his mohawk and the motivation of his actions. Either way I loved this film, I will make my friends watch it, and when I have children, they will too.",

De Niro is an incredible actor in everything he does; but this movie was good for more reasons than just De Niro's unmatchable talent. The message of the loneliness and torture inside a disturbed mind is one that is not frequented enough by film. Yet one could argue that it is one of the most important phenomenons to be aware of. In an age where random violence is becoming increasingly more prevalent and excessive media coverage is bringing these stories of real-life horrors into everyone's living rooms, it seems bizarre that as a society we are not more interested in the abnormal psychology of the human mind. The irony of Travis' loneliness in the middle of New York City, one of the most densely populated areas in the country, is another thing that brings meaning to this film. Loneliness is a state of mind; not something that happens just from physical isolation from people. The final scene was hard to watch, I'll admit. The ugliness of the raw violence was almost too much for me to handle. But I also found some realness in this murder scene that doesn't seem to appear in movies as much today. This film was absolutely excellent and I highly recommend it!",

Essentially, this is the story about a man who wants to wipe the violence off of the streets, and with nobody left to turn to and no friends, his inner demon ensues to take control of ""his city."" Robert De Niro is perfect as Travis Bickle, an ex-marine with a split personality, the dark one, in which, is about to be let out of the cage. ""Taxi Driver"" is one of those rare occasions when just watching the main character do his thing on screen can solely make the film a pure masterpiece. Besides some great character development, this film does not really have much to do, unless you are looking in between the lines. This is a very intelligent film that I just could not take my eyes off of. By the end, you will not be disappointed. Tense, at times witty, and sometimes downright brutal. This film is brilliant!",

Robert Deniro portrays this character and is phenomenal throughout. Deniro plays a man who seems destined to wipe the street of the scum of the city as he continually gets angrier and angrier and violent even to a point where he shoots a man robbing a store in the back of the head without remorse. After this, Deniro becomes more and more sick of what he sees and hears in his cab in everyday life like Robberies, prostitution and drugs and decides he is destined to end it in his own way. Scorsese does this by adding a 12 yr old prostitute in which Deniro takes a liking to. He pays her to get the time to talk to her so he can try and help return her to her parents and ordinary childhood life. Scorsese's pure brilliance and directing are trademark to what this film was. A study of a man who is utterly disgusted with the way the world is and confused in which way he fits in the world. I believe taxi driver is one of the ten greatest movies of all time because of the versimiltude and realism it brings to the table. Taxi Driver tackles the issue of a man trying to find out who he is and what he can do for the world that seems to suffer around him.",

De Niro delivers a brilliant performance which is unbeaten throughout the film (although Scorsese's cameo is remarkable), creating a character we neither like nor hate. It would have been so easy to paint him as a monster. The camera is similarly masterful, showing us the seediest depths of New York. Thank god it didn't go to Robert Mulligan (To Kill a Mockingbird) and James Bridges (the original choices for director and actor).",
848,16 December 2011,GoodBen,10, Taxi Driver Review,"This seems like a crime-fighting vigilante movie to me. In it, we see how a mentally unstable veteran, played by Robert DeNiro, gradually deteriorates to an out of control vigilante who is fed up with the problems of society and decides to take matters into his own hands. The plot is filled with tension and action. This, along with its setting, the rough streets of New York with prostitutes and criminals, makes for an interesting story. I enjoyed DeNiro's performance as the increasingly out of control Travis, as well as Jodie Foster's performance as Iris, the child prostitute he decides to save. I liked the scene towards the ending where DeNiro made his way through the apartment building battling all of the thugs trying to save Iris.

849,24 September 1998,tbickle-2,10," A masterpiece, with great mood and characters","Taxi Driver is one of my all time favorite films.  It is Scorsese's finest work.  Every element in the rising action of the film adds to an uneasy tension.  From the steaming sewers, to assorted people on the sidewalks, to Travis' bleak, disturbing narration, and each camera movement unseats the viewer giving you the same experience Travis is having.  Due to this feeling created by the film, you can really understand the Travis character.  He is the only film psycho, which I can really empathise with.  He is completely over the edge, and yet at the same time completely understandable.  Scorsese's brilliant directing, and DeNiro's amazing acting together create one of the most incredible film experiences I have ever had.",

The beginning starts off a little bit slow, but the climax is amazing. Great acting, dialog, directing, and basically everything.

The intense film pairs well with the intense actor Robert De Niro. His character Travis Bickle sums up to be a very odd character and even a psychotic character. His psychosis grows throughout the movie and quirky sense of humor can be found to be disturbing at some points. Yet he shows a lot of affection towards Becky he is still a hopelessly alone character throughout the movie. Travis' thought grow more dark and disturbing and even violent throughout the movie.

I like a series of films of New Hollywood because the story shows a unique sense of values or a view of the world and the main characters are antisocial, but they have their own idea and try to express themselves and insist on what they think even though it may be wrong. I think this film also tells us that what the right justice is as well as the importance of holding their own justice. It is a deep story. I recommend everyone, especially those who like New Hollywood to watch this film.",

He is a taxi driver (hence the name) by name and goes and sees porn by day. Although he isn't your usual good guy he does want to help and make the world better and his way of helping is by helping a 13 year old girl, Iris, who recently was left by her pimp, oh did I mention she was a 13 year old prostitute. This movie is definitely a psychological drama and Scorsese uses certain editing tools to increase our eagerness. He uses a lot of slow camera movement to build up the expectation. The movie also takes place in New York City, which is paints at this horrifying place by making the scenes dark and unpleasant. One editing tool that Scorsese uses that really put us in the mind of Travis were the voice over. One example of this was when Travis is reading his diary, but all of sudden mid sentence the shot cuts and repeats itself. Your first thought might be that the movie skip or there was some type of error, but no, it actually is meant to abruptly stop and start over again. This edit is done to show us how Travis' mind really works, it give us an inside look on how Travis' thoughts flow, and his current mental state. Taxi Driver is a high energy and definitely interesting, and it's always fun to see act Robert De Niro in a film, especially a younger version than I am use to!",
859,10 April 2005,scorsese-1,10, A tour de force by the brilliant Martin Scorsese,"Martin Scorsese establishes himself as one of the greatest directors of all time with the movie Taxi Driver. He examines, urban loneliness and despair through the character of Travis Bickle, brilliantly portrayed by Robert Deniro. With direct homage to the classic John Ford western The Searchers, Scorsese traces the events that lead to the release of a young girl being prostituted by a pimp named Sport. Similarly,in The Searchers a character named Ethan, played by John Wayne, is in a desperate search for his niece abducted by an Indian named Scar. The main characters in both films are both lonely wanderers and war veterans. Travis's destiny takes a turn after an unsuccessful attempt to establish a relationship with a girl played by Cybill Shepherd. He subsequently purchases several guns, which symbolically represent phallic symbols through which he will ultimately release his suppressed sexuality. In the final segment,when he ultimately confronts Sport, he points the gun at him and says ""suck on this"". Then he proceeds on a bloody rampage to release the young girl, which metaphorically represents a cathartic sexual release for Travis. This scene is absolutely riveting. The direction and the pacing throughout is impeccable.The mood is greatly enhanced by a superb score by Bernard Hermann. A modern masterpiece.",

The film's main star Travis Bickle played by Robert De Niro ,is an edgy character with many moral flaws. The film has an excellent plot alongside an equally satisfying setting. The quality during the violence is top notch. It is artistically gory, and the colors used during the violence is different and interesting. The film has iconic dialogue such as the famous ""are you talking to me"". The film could not have shined if it hadn't been for De Niro's performance. This movie is a classic example of the wonders of new Hollywood, and Scorsese as the master filmmaker. Overall I give Taxi Driver (1976) a 9 out of 10.",

What I will say though is this- if you don't get the hype around either Scorcese or De Niro, then let this change your mind. For me, the real strength of this film is its unrelenting darkness- it's a true horror film in my view and, as a character study, I think it's one of the finest pieces of cinema that I've seen to date. Also, a quick shout out to the score which provides a gritty jazz backdrop which only serves to further the chill that this film will leave you with. Why not a perfect 10? I'd say that the film is pretty slow-paced and, whilst the payoff more than delivers, you may find your patience tested a little bit in the meantime.",
862,6 May 2020,cgcastanedo-75966,10," ""You talkin' to me?""","One of the most renowned contemporary American filmmakers, with a fair amount of high-end films, is undoubtedly Martin Scorsese. From its beginnings in the sixties to the present time, it has dabbled in practically all film genres and at the same time generated work dumbbells with great actors, such as in this case, Robert De Niro with whom he has made a dozen films, including his most recent work ""The Irishman"" and since 2002 with Leonardo DiCaprio with whom he has also filmed several and very good movies.
""Taxi Driver"" 1976, continues with his critical description of his native New York that had begun in another great 1973 film ""Mean Streets"" showing without contemplation the degrading life in which part of its population operates. Supported by a script by Paul Schrader, of strict Calvinist training, which denotes the strong moralistic burden of the film, Scorsese through the vision of a taxi driver ""with studies here and there"" Travis Bickle, (travel vehicle) presents us the imperative need of the human being to be recognized, to be someone and even more important to find meaning in life.
Thus we enter the routine life and pathology of a lonely man, in an impersonal city full of garbage, crime and vices. ""I think somebody should just take this city and just ... flush it down the f----n 'toilet"".
Scorsese, plays the passenger in the taxi who notes his wife's infidelity, to personally underline the rot of his society. Travis, witness of all this and of his bewildering and traumatic personal experiences, and immersed in his great psychosis, decides to take action and do justice on his own. ""Listen you f-----s, you screw heads. Here is a man who would not take it anymore ...""
This film is key for countless reasons, in addition to positioning Scorsese as a 1st-level filmmaker, it consolidates Robert De Niro as a talented actor and drives the very successful career of Jodie Foster when playing a prostitute with only 12 years of age.
Both the Michael Chapman cinematography and the sometimes poignant and at other times relaxing music of Bernard Herrmann, added to the script of Paul Schrader and to the excellent interpretations of Robert De Niro and Jodie Foster make ""Taxi Driver"" a classic and current film from the end of the S XX.
Cast includes Cibyll Shepherd, Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle, Albert Brooks.",

A very ordinary guy who tries to break his isolation, but can't. The graphic and disturbing images of a man who lost his mind, control, and morals. It wasn't awful I'll give it that but I feel that labeling it as a cinematic masterpiece is a bit much.

But what I mean is how he reacts to everything around him, and I find that to be important. It's probably awkward to say, but this movie was tough. The main character was tough, and to see him go to such great lengths for a little girl, it's kinda touching. Violent? Definitely. Kind of perverted? A little, some parts rubbed me the wrong way, and though child prostitution is a real thing, it'll always bother me.

Travis was a Vietnam war veteran and we have veterans today struggling to integrate into society.

868,12 May 1999,urick,10, God's lonely man in hell,"A real modern-day drama cleverly directed about the universal theme of the average urbanite's loneliness. The first scene I enjoy is the meeting and the intense dialogues of the pre-""Maniac"" Joe Spinell as the cab dispatcher. Then, the Travis Bickle's alienated character and his inability to communicate and share with others. For instance, the relation with his colleague, Wizard (Peter Boyle), in the café is important to understand his behaviour and the close-up of the aspirin glass symbolizes well-enough Man's distress. Remember this existentialist monologue : ""I don't believe that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention. I believe that someone should become a person, like other people..."" The burning desire to get out of his own nightmarish routine life is in the utopian relationship between him and Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who both come from very different worlds. Violence frees himself from his schizophrenic impulses. He becomes the cold exterminating angel who gets rid of the devilish-pimps in one of the most terrible manslaughter. Remember this determinist monologue : ""Now I see it clearly, my whole life is pointed in one direction... I see that, now. There never has been any choice for me..."" Robert de Niro's tour de force performance with his best-remembered monomaniac monologue : ""You talkin' to me ?"" belong to every film fans. The importance of the guns as iconic props is showed when the nihilist, Travis Bickle, uses a sleeve-gun gadget inspired from ""The wild wild west"" series. Martin Scorsese's performance is funny as the cuckhold husband with his 44 Magnum. Bernard Herrmann's dreamlike and haunting music emphasizes the theme of the obsession which is, unfortunately, his last score. Michael Chapman's sharp cinematography makes the New York City location hellish. The whole mood of the film is scary, realistic, violent and sordid.

876,27 September 2006,user-11167,1, a praise for murder not a master piece,"I believe the word pathetic is on its place here meaning the subject of the movie work ""TAXI DRIVER"" not the visual style, the acting and of course a very bad screenplay with bad lines which i believe is making this film work to a film work which musn't be consider as a momentum in the history of film-making. The lead actor Mr. De Niro is really a pathetic person and the whole performance of Mr. De Niro is laughable and Mr.De Niro his performance seems like if he is reading the lines out of a bad juvenile novel. The one aspect of this film work that can be consider a more than average is the visual style that is covering the bad acting bad lines in this film work where murder is praised and that is the subject of a movie work, where the original screenplay was killing members of an ethnic minority group in the United States of America, and where murder is hailed. Ms Foster is playing a child prostitute which I personally wouldn't advice anyone who have young individuals living at home to see this film work, because this film work must be consider as inappropriate for these individuals to watch, even though one might say that it is film work and not the reflection of reality. In that sense the film work ""TAXI DRIVER"" is not a reflecting of reality, but a reflecting of how in Hollywood the law is not consider as a serious option. Why did the main character didn't go to police to report the pimp played by Mr. Keitel for keeping a minor as prostitute ? This is the appropriate way to solve this. That the producers and the director, who also is hailing e.g. the use of a gun in a scene where a client(played by the director)is asking the main character if he realize what a magnum 54 can do if you put it in a woman, meaning his wife who is having sex with another man, her vagina. The Film work ""TAXI WORK"" is a low budget movie with a low budget theme and in my opinion cannot be consider as an piece of art.",

Taxi Driver stars Robert De Niro as Travis, a Vietnam War veteran who becomes a taxi driver. Scorsese reveals Travis' slow decline to insanity, eventually going on rampage. The movie does a great job at developing Travis character , and De Niro delivers a excellent performance. Although I have only seen one other Scorsese work, Hugo, I highly recommend this movie.",

879,9 December 2010,c-farrell7,9, The Process of going mad.,"This is one of the best films that I have ever seen. It delves into the seedy underworld of New York City in the 70's and follows the mental self destruction of a restless cab driver. Robert De Niro is chilling as Travis Bickle, a cab driver who finds the city and its inhabitants to be sickening and slowly begins to plot a plan to do something about it. As a director Scorsese shines. He really creates a world where the viewer can understand the violent and hateful ideas that Travis begins to have. Scorsese also makes a disturbing cameo in the middle of the movie as a troubled man who gets in Travis' cab only to have him stop in front of the apartment that his wife is having an affair in. He then describes to De Niro's character how he is going to kill her by shooting her with a 44 magnum, which is one of the many guns De Niro's character buys later in the film to carry out his ill fated plan. Scorsese ends the film in a way that could be interpreted differently by different people. To some people that last few scenes are either the dying fantasy's of Travis Bickle, yet others interpret it as the ultimate ironic ending where the man who was attempting to commit an act that would cause him to be hated by the public ends up screwing it up only to become a self-less hero who is responsible for saving a 12 year old girl from the hell of prostitution.",
880,30 November 2005,fleaaaaaa,10, The appeal of Taxi Driver,"Why does taxi driver have so much appeal? Well simply because there are so many Travis Bickle's in the world. I have to ask you a question, have you ever felt alone? Walked down a street full of strangers, realising there is no-one around that you know? I'm sure most people have felt that sometime, but Travis Bickle takes that to the most extreme degree, he feels like that all the time. The man who bring this character to life happens to be the rather obsessive, meticulous, method actor, that is Robert Deniro. Travis is such a complex character, miles away from most two dimensional Hollywood blockbuster heroes, for Robert Deniro to bring him to life, well to me makes him one of the greatest movie actors. He doesn't have a ""catchphrase"", he doesn't have friends, basically all he has is his job and his own loneliness. So basically I would say that Travis is the ultimate anti-hero.",

De Niro plays the role of Travis so well it's amazing. You talking' to me? The cinematography of the film is abstract and fits just right. Many rack focuses, and many tracking shots, montages, and medium shots. It's got it all. The film follows Travis' lonely life as a taxi driver in New York City. We truly see Travis' life of isolation, being out of touch almost with most of the outside world besides what people tell him.

Robert De Niro's performance as a hardened Vietnam War Veteran is the best performance in the actor's career. Martin Scorsese's direction is somewhat dreamlike in it's depiction of a sociopathic mind at it's breaking point. Bernard Hermann adds to the dreamy visuals of the film with a very eerie jazz-like kind of score that stirs as well as unsettles.

885,1 May 2011,jejohnson2244,6," Not as disturbing as I thought, but QUESTIONABLY weird","Lets face it this is a good movie (if your talking weird) in its own way but I didn't find anything disturbing about it. I found that the twelve year old prostitute made me very uncomfortable when(spoiler) talking about selling her crotch or unbuckling a grown man's pants but I guess that's the life of a prostitute. Anyway this could be a nineteen-seventy six batman film if the man didn't kill because hey who knows if batman loves porn or not. Back to the script, a 26 year old discharged military man that thinks an awful lot, writes in his journal and has trouble sleeping drives a taxi cab for money and travels through the bad parts of New York. As he sees the scum and filth of this city, he wants to do something about it but what? While he decides, he tries to talk to women but sucks at it so he stalks a woman at a newspaper center who notices him sitting in the taxi. This gives him the chance to be Dr. House and analyze her feelings which some how impresses her... Odd. Well not knowing a woman's worth nor movies takes her to an educational booty movie and she leaves him boo hew. Any-who he talks to a senator running for president about the scum and filth and surprisingly (sarcasm) could care less. So he runs into the 12 year old prostitute again(the one mentioned at the top. Note: the first time he saw her was on one of his routes though she was doped up trying to escape. The second time he nearly ran her over & then decided to follow her to a traffic light)and promises to get her out of the game by becoming a vigilante though the girl thinks he's weird (don't blame her). He goes and kills the pimps and all is well. It doesn't sound to exciting(because it ain't) but it is very interesting in its own way. DeNiro's acting as his character is very well done playing a young man who is weird and so on. I'd say give it a rent or buy it cheap on DVD ( trust me, it might bore you & you'll never watch it again),just don't show this to your kids as a lesson parents with sense(especially those with no sense.)Masterpiece, Not in my eyes.",

After a few hours when I pondered upon my experience, the cinematic excellence of this classic dawned upon me. It is not as smart and hard-hitting like my other Martin Scorsese's favorites (""The Departed"", Gangs of New York), but this one grows on you. This film had it all - good starcast (its all about Robert Di Nero), good camera-work, strong script to work with, nice editing to tie-up the movie, apt music which added to the element of the movie (as intended by the director) and of course, strong direction to bring it all together.",
894,8 May 2010,pinkpanther1164,8, Scorceses First Masterpiece,"Martin Scorcsese's first popular film was Taxidriver from 1976. Scorsese is a NY based man, so it wasn't a surprise when his movies reflected the classic NY attitude. Robert DeNiro played the part of Travis Bickle, a once marine who served in Vietnam who is now looking to become a NYC taxi driver. Travis is a young man that is searching for a sense of somewhere to go. The life of a taxi driver is not an easy one; You see everything. He was willing to drive anywhere, but the parts of the city he was around the most weren't easy streets. You needed to have courage which Travis did. On route one night, he encounters a prostitute in trouble, but he does nothing. He sees this girl around and always wonders about her and if he can do anything. As Scorsese plays out the plot, you learn that Travis has some psychological issues that caused him to not always be the popular one in a group. He acts on pure reaction or emotion and lacks the interaction skills needed to act as a key part of society. He end up meeting up with the 12 year old prostitute named Iris, and makes a promise that one day he will save her. Travis murders her pimp and anyone in his way, but Iris is saved. Normally, if you were to hear that someone murdered multiple people you wouldn't think of him as a hero. Scrosese twists DeNiros character into a man that you you support for saving Iris. This film shows early on that Scorsese was an insanely talented man that adds a great touch to the Hollywood film world.",

This was a well shot, dark, gritty, and depressing look at late night city life and how people can be seedy, disgusting, and it's down-right depressing. DeNiro does a great job of having the best intentions and then, pretty much, becoming that he despises and wants to get rid of. I believe that, without DeNiro, this would still have been a well-done artistic movie, but DeNiro does a good job of making this more than that by getting you to come down to his view and root for him, even though he's kind of crazy. It's a classic and rightfully so. So if you haven't seen it, you should.",

897,29 May 2019,jackamccallum,10," Scorsese's Analysis of Masculinity, Unchecked Aggression, Violence and a Psychopath","Taxi Driver may be one of cinemas best character studies. The story follows Travis Bickle a Vietnam veteran now employed as a taxi driver in New York City who thinks the world has gone to hell and needs to be cleansed by someone like him through violence. Robert De Niro in one of his best performances plays Travis like a ticking time bomb who off go off at any moment. He is aggressive, cynical and craves violence. De Niro uses both subtlety and occasional spontaneous outbursts to show the audience Travis's mental state and to communicate that this is not a man to aspire to. Scorsese uses the camera expertly with it acting as almost and observer judging Travis. He uses clever and interesting angles to hint towards Travis's violent cravings (most noticeably the first person perspective when Travis aims a gun out the window and the glance in the rear view mirror at the end of the film). Scorsese creates a seedy and dirty version of New York City with literal piles of trash on side walks in some scenes in the movie with prostitutes and pimps as side characters. Taxi Driver is a shocking film that is expertly acted by Robert De Niro and Directed by Martin Scorsese in one of their many collaborations together. The film is intense, brutal and violent at times but that is exactly how one would describe Travis.",
898,9 April 2019,MonkyMangler,10, There's a Travis Bickle in all of us,"Taxi Driver is a rare example of how to tell a story through the eyes of the protagonist/antagonist. There's many ways to interpret this film and what it all meant depending on who you are. Some have viewed the character Travis as a psychotic gunman to a misunderstood hero. The film itself is excellent and easily makes it into my top 3, and the reason why is not just the acting, cinematography, style, or the well developed characters. This film did more then that, it stuck with me on a personal level. Never once in a movie have i ever related to someone like Travis Bickle. And i think i relate to him so much because he is just like you or me. I'm pretty sure we've all been at a point where our anger and rage reaches to a boiling point and we wish to act upon it, but our morals and better judgement usually stop us. We want acceptance from our peers and society in general, but when we don't achieve that we are then angry at the world. These feelings are perfectly represented with Travis Bickle. No person is safe from insanity. If pushed far enough you could one day become Travis. Whether or not you think Travis is a Hero or Villain, the Ending was a dream or reality, i think a majority of us can agree that Travis Bickle is a complex and well written character and everyone who worked on this film went above and beyond to bring us a film that forever engraved itself into movie history.",
899,10 September 2022,wrkdanieldegenstein,7, Kinda overrated but...,"This film shows us what happens when a man is lonely. Travis is a Taxi driver in New York who suffers from sleepless nights and severe depression. The depiction of the city and the atmosphere in general are very gloomy, depressing and melancholy. I must say that, shockingly, I could identify with the protagonist very well at the beginning of the film. Every day is like any other, there seems to be no point to what you do anymore. As the film progresses, we see Travis' psyche start to deteriorate. He meets two women and circumstances lead him to convince himself that, as a man, he must play the hero. The film is surprisingly feminist, with themes of status and masculinity playing a large role. We get to see Travis become more and more driven by anger at the society. He tells himself that his actions are motivated by heroism, but in reality they are simply motivated by his masculinity, and the film portrays this quite well. Taxi Driver is a great classic that can be recommended to anyone who loves this kind of atmosphere.",

This is Martin Scorsese's taxi driver played by Robert DeNiro, at the height of his powers as an actor. He's so young, taunt & handsome & totally out of it, in a totally out of it city. DeNiro plays Travis Bickle (great name) who we see in a series of memorable scenes is a time bomb ticking away, ready to blow up in society's face. And even though we know the big bang is coming, we are still shocked, surprised & disturbed by the bloody ending. This was Scorsese's second big time Hollywood feature, done after his light but very likeable ""woman's picture"" ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" which won Ellen Burstyn an Oscar. This is a young director's movie, exciting,dangerous & full of great images & scenes, that exhibit a willingness to take chances which mostly pay off big time. It's also a scary movie, an urban horror show for real. The city of night in this movie is both beautiful with neon colors reflecting on wet streets, and ugly in its deprevation and decay. The film is ""religious"" & spiritual taking us along for the anti-hero's long dark journey through hell, both internal & external and his violent and bloody redemption. This Scorsese landscape is littered with human garbage: child whores & pimps, criminals & politicians, crazies who want to do terrible things, politicians who want to get elected. This is a beautifully made and crafted film, full of memorable lines & images. Gliding taxis with steam rising from the streets, Bernard Herrmann's last great score, jazzy and mournful rides along for the trip. Notable performances by little miss Foster, before she became the Oscar winning movie star, rigid & uptight. She's so good eating her toast & jam, trying to sex up Deniro, slow dancing with Harvey the greasy pimp, that we almost think she's the real McCoy, a miniature Mary waiting to be saved. Also good are the already mentioned Harvey Keitel, Albert Brooks as the campaign worker luckless in love with blonde venus Cybill Shepherd (also never better) & the director himself as the taxi passenger from hell,who wants to do terrible things to his cheating wife's private parts. This guy is so bad & creepy that even Travis is frighten. Also of note is Michael Chapman's candy colored cinematography & the gorgous Diahnne Abbott (married at the time to DeNiro)in a bit part as the porn theatre cashier. Although I'm not crazy about the epilogue ending,(was this used to make us feel better?) this is still one of the great films, if not the greatest film of the 70's, and one of Scorsese's masterpieces. Hard to believe that he did not receive a best director Oscar nomination, and that the film itself lost out for best picture to the simple and sentimental Rocky. Well actually maybe I shouldn't be surprised.",

Robert De Niro is brilliant as the mentally disturbed, yet universally lonely Travis Bickle.  Jodie Foster is extraordinary as the 12 year old prostitute Iris, vengeful towards her parents.  Martin Scorsese did a ground breaking movie, not for the violence, but for it's powerful impact as a humanist story in a way of speaking.  Upon first inspection of this film, I really didn't know what to think about it. I thought it was unnecessarily violent towards the end, and thus thought the murder in the film was ludicrous and pointless.  But I watched it again the next day, and discovered something about not only Travis, but New York.  New York was a disturbing place back in the 70's according to Bickle.

And of course, with all the situations he deals with and witnesses, it really makes some kind of alter-egos of him. And this movie builds up one of the best climaxes made in cinema history, with its editing of slow altitude movements as day goes by, with the dialogue. And all that is disturbing in this film, makes it difficult to find a tranquil light to this. Although I'd say the light is metaphorically translucent, as of being hard to see what is really so wonderful. And this movie actually makes you realize what is wonderful and how you manage and use those expressions. Although it is hard to pertain in the film. Just something that is perspective.

(i don't know about the American law BTW) i am really confused here, i am giving 5 star rating because initially i really enjoyed the mysterious flow of the movie, and i thought there going to be a awesome twist like in departed or shutter island. but last 20 minutes or so i became really fed up with the movie since what i expected was not there. maybe there is a connection in the movie i don't understood which makes this movie a good movie. but not definitely a masterpiece. i know this review does not give you a better idea, but guys you have to watch it yourself to really understand. some will be agree with me, some not. everyone has different views right?

919,21 October 2012,dume-officialinbox,10, Scorsese's Masterpiece,"This movie have everything, from great script and direction to great performances and edition. We all know, and for those who do not, that Martin Scorsese is an auteur type of director so that he introduces a little of his persona into the film so that we may find things like the music of rock n roll or jazz, plot in the streets or gangs in his movies, because of the life he lived on the streets plus his drug addition to those times. But anyways, talking about the film, Taxi Driver it's indeed a masterpiece. The main character is an unstable Vietnam veteran that uses to work at nights as a taxi driver and every night he encounters new situations with his passengers that even can lead to a murder of another person. This man hates the people that are prostitutes, murderers and all kind of low persons out in the street that he sees every night and he decides that if government don't eliminate people like that, he will get rid of them by himself but as time passes he meets this young girl who works as a prostitute and decides to help her get out from her misery.",

It almost takes you in the mind of Deniro. How he views the world. A remarkable, disturbing film that used a unforgettable musical score. The narration by Deniro throughout the movie helped you get in his mind even further. A dark and dreary movie. It really got grim and the script kept you waiting for a giant explosion to happen.

I have seen quite a few De Niro/Scorses collaborations (Raging Bull,Goodfellas,Casino) and this absorbing performance ranks right up there with the best i have ever seen, with the exception of Raging Bull. Ignoring the acting limitations of Cybill Shepherd, this film is a great watch and at just under 2 hours, it is a suitable length. The other supporting roles are well portrayed, including Jodie Foster as a 12-year old prostitute who is the source of motivation behind Bickles transformation into the city's ""hero.""

930,9 December 2015,ny_willbaker,9, Psychological Thriller,"Taxi Driver (1976) has got to be one of Di Niro's best films (at least in my opinion) because of how he submersed himself into this role. This film takes what the 60's did, pushing limits of what was acceptable in Hollywood, and showcased just how far Hollywood was willing to go...which was anywhere. Di Niro is so creepy yet you enjoy is vigilantism of going around the city ""protecting"" it. Di Niro's character, Travis, is one of those characters that you really don't want to like, but you end up being cool with his targets. I really liked this movie not just because of the excellent acting, but also because of some of the car scenes. The camera footage is pretty insane when driving through the streets.",

Scorsese does a commendable job of taking us on a disturbing ride with the main character, Travis Bickle (played by Robert De Niro) as he tries and ultimately fails to live a normal life in opposition to following through on an internal power fantasy. The cinematography in the film is truly exceptional, and Scorsese does a fantastic job of keeping the viewer engaged with some truly creative camera-work and shots. The acting is also excellent and young De Niro, as well as the supporting cast, all give great performances. I also found the soundtrack of the movie notable in it's excellence and support of the films atmosphere.

940,25 January 2003,guido anselmi,10, An American masterpiece,"There may be a handful of American films that are better, but in my opinion ""Taxi Driver"" is the United State's most significant contribution to the world of cinema. Travis Bickle is what we have left as a protagonist in a world when heroism is dismissed as passe and empty. He is as endearing as he is disturbing. Like Cybill Shepherd's character, we've never met anyone quite like him. But we understand him. We feel his frustration and his suffering. It's the frustration of those living in an isolationist culture that tries to make islands of all people. Travis is God's lonely man, just as some could call Americans God's lonely people. I know I'm reading a lot into it, but in my opinion the central themes of ""Taxi Driver"" stem from the darker, alienating aspect of American culture. It's so much more observant in it's depiction of failed American values than other films. ""Citizen Kane"" is a film about material greed and loss of innocence. Travis is also seeking innocence but his greed is not for corporeal things but for love and acceptance. For a chance to contribute to people's lives. His suffering is greater than almost any other character in American film and literature, because he seems to understand what is truly valuable in this life (justice, self-respect, love) but is driven mad by his inability to attain them. Do I recommend this film? No. I demand that everyone sees it at one point in their lives. It's that important.",

943,13 February 2019,josephinemallorys,10, Phenomenal,"What can you say about ""Taxi Driver"" that hasn't been said already? It's phenomenal. I'm not a fan of Scorsese's other directorial efforts, really--nor am I a big DeNiro fan--but everything about this film is absolutely, unquestionably RIGHT. So many people seem to be confused when they watch this movie: they either root for Travis Bickle when he finally loses his marbles, or they feel that ""Taxi Driver"" tries to justify racism and misogyny. I don't think there's any need to go to such extremes. Yes, there are elements of racism and misogyny here, but the film doesn't promote those attitudes. And as for Travis being the nominal ""hero"" of the film, I don't believe that this was Paul Schrader's intention, either. There ARE no heroes; ultimately, this is just the very grim story of a marginalized man who loses what little control he had to begin with. This is why ""Taxi Driver"" appeals to people, I believe, but it's also why the film is routinely misinterpreted. As Schrader has said, this is a film about alienation. ""Taxi Driver"" tells an interesting, engaging human story and that's what makes it great--not the social commentary, or what's viewed as such.",
944,14 January 2006,Imaginist,10, Taxi Driver (5/5 stars),"Synopsis: ""Taxi Driver"" is a character study, and oh what a character study it is. Robert DeNiro is brilliant as Travis Bickle, a NYC taxi driver, who I found to be an OK guy even though he made some stupid decisions. This is probably the crux of the film: we have a guy who tries to do the right thing, but his faults prevent him from always doing so. For example, Travis meets this new foxy lady, played by Cybill Shepard, and takes her out to see a porno for their second date. I don't believe he intentionally meant to offend her, but he does, and it costs him their relationship. It is rather unfortunate considering how happy she made him. Another reason I find Travis to be an alright guy is even after this he tries to make amends with her, but to no avail. I suppose here in lies the problem with Travis: his faults cloud his true character and this causes him to be isolated from others. Although Travis is the result of much of his loneliness I don't believe that he intentionally brings it upon himself--he just isn't very bright. Intelligence may not be Bickle's strong point, but anger and loneliness sure are--Travis becomes not only angry with himself, but angry with the world (as is exampled by his subtle racism), and in fact, he blames the world for all his troubles. Travis is tired of being lonely and ignored--Travis wants to be noticed; he wants to be somebody (wouldn't we all under the circumstances?). Therefore Bickle decides to assassinate a political figure in order to get his old girl friend's (Shepard) attention, as she was working on his campaign. However, when this plot fails to come to fruition Travis makes a last ditch effort to make something of himself--he decides to rescue a child hooker he befriended (played by a wonderful Jodie Foster) from the pimps who enslaved her. This is another reason I found Travis to be good person underneath the rough exterior: although he is tempted to sleep with the girl he doesn't, and instead tries to convince her to leave prostitution. If Travis was truly a monster he would have taken advantage of his young friend, but instead, he displays a higher moral fortitude, which shows that he is capable of being a good guy. Travis successfully frees the young hooker (by killing off the pimps) and surprisingly, he gets the attention he desires. This ending is simply incredible--it is brutally violent, and quite shocking. Although Travis does free the prostitute, we also know that he should not be considered the hero he is made out to be--after all, he freed Jodie's character for his own deranged desires of recognition and attention. ""Taxi Driver"" is an incredibly complicated story that demands great attention. It shows us both sides of Travis Bickle: his good side, and then his deranged crusade for self serving glory. Although I could have become angry with Travis, and hated him, I could not bring myself to do so. I felt sympathetic towards him. When I got right down to it, he was a sick and lonely man, who was incredibly desperate. This film shows us how desperate situations can create desperate people, and sometimes, these people finally snap. The other aspect of ""Taxi Driver"" that dazzled me was how well this film also served as a potent social commentary. The very society that drove Travis to madness, is also the society that treats him as a hero after he murders the pimps; would the public's reaction have been the same if he actually killed the political figure? It is interesting how urban life can twist a man and then twist his actions into something advantageous. Like Travis, it would seem we are more interested in end results rather than our motivations or our means of achieving those results. ""Taxi Driver"" is a complex film that is sure to take various viewings to decipher its multiple messages; however, I think once the viewer has completed the journey down insanity lane, he or she will be more than pleased. For the beautiful yet grungy cinematography, terrific acting, amazing story, and for the infamous ""Are you talking' to me?"" scene, I give ""Taxi Driver"": 5 out of 5 stars.",

947,16 September 2014,y-melon0326,7, historical film,"When I finished watching Taxi Driver, I felt uncomfortable and I didn't understand this film. Firstly, I'm going to talk about the relationship between background and this film. This film was created in 1976 and at that time, there were the Vietnam War and the assassination. The main character, Travis Bickle, was a marine and he suffers from insomnia which is related to the seriousness of the war. Furthermore, his hair style is also the influence of the war. In 1972, Arthur Herman Bremer tried to assassinate George. C. Wallace and becomes the first and only one person who becomes a free man again. Mr. Bremer said at the time of his trial that his motive was to become a celebrity, and many observers have noted the pernicious, if unintended, effect that intense media attention has had, glamorizing assassins and inspiring copycats. Finally, I have some comments and questions. First, what did Martin Scorsese want to tell us? The meaning of this film is unclear and the ending story is really terrifying and annoying so I don't like it but I think he tells us that there are a lot of evils which is allowed in our society. On the other hand, it has some good points. I like camera works of Travis's sight which seems to a real world and a fantasy. The long mirror scene is also funny. In addition, I like the sticker on his cloth at the end. It is nice to watch this film and compare with history but sometimes you have to see brutal scenes.",

Most of the shots in this film are slow, ironic because the life of a taxi driver is quick. The deliberate shots emphasize the loneliness felt by Bickle, and his separation from society.

955,17 July 2006,hudiefanny,9, Black elements in Taxi Driver,"Film noir has its own primary characteristics and conventions. For instance, most film noirs are shot in gloomy grays, blacks and whites. And the peak of production of film noir is from about 1945 to 1950. Taxi Driver, which was produced in the period of American Film Renaissance (1967-1976), was also one of film noirs because of the black elements in it. The film showed the dark and inhumane side of human nature cynicism and doomed love like all the traditional film noir. Travis fell in love with Betsy, who firstly appeared as an angel according to Travis. She found Travis attractive at first and was willing to go out some times with him, which was concluded as strange finally. There were all kinds of women in the society. But he could not have one, only because he was contradictive as Betsy described, though he had a clear-conscience. On the contrary, those who had not clear-conscience could have those women, such as dirty politicians and even pimps. It's the unfair and dark side of not only the human experience, but also the society. It's a world filled with entrapment, menace and squalid in which people were tend to go wrong and crazy. Usually, the protagonists in film noir were driven by their past or by human weakness to do something very wrong. In Taxi Driver, Travis came back from the army with no work, no friends, nothing, but a clear conscience, a sensitive heart and ability of action. The story was of urban night scenes and mostly took place in murky streets and dimly-lit buildings or hotel rooms. The director often took Travis's sight as the camera angle. When he observed the world from the front window of his taxi, the director of Taxi Driver used expressionistic lighting in making lots of disorienting and colorful sights to allude to the distorted world. And he also skillfully edited a succession of jarring scenes, like prostitutes, queens and fairies walking on the street, together as all kinds of epitomes of the dark society. Sometimes, narratives of a film noir would be made by the male protagonist as self-confession or backward look. Taxi Driver just changed the narratives into self-talk, diaries and letters, which, I think, also marked the movie as black. ""I go all over. I take people to the Bronx, Brooklyn, to Harlem. I don't care. Don't make no difference to me."" pointed out that Travis was lonely and alienated to the society by others or maybe by himself. Without any intention to join the sick and venal world, Travis wished that someday a real rain would come and wash all the scum off the street. It was the murky world and the failure of approaching other people that disappointed and despaired Travis and got him out of the belief for God. Travis bought four guns and decided to clear up the dirt of the world himself as he cleaned up the blood on the backseats of his taxi, which had been his expectation to the president candidate. When Travis used the gun at the first time to kill a robber in a convenient store, he was at loss about what to do now. The store keeper was very calm and told Travis that he could just leave and he would handle it himself. This detail revealed us a fact that this kind of robbery and killing was not fresh but happening all the time and all around in the city. ",
956,9 December 2019,John0711,8, Analysis for Taxi Driver,"In the beginning of the movie when Travis is walking along the street Travis fades out and then fades back in further down the street.
After this scene the movie uses a voice over of Travis talking about his hours as a taxi driver and what his typical nights were like driving around in his taxi.
You can tell that Travis is an alcoholic because throughout the film he has a drink that is in a paper bag which most will understand is alcohol.
When Travis walks into a shop where it starts off with a few men talking, Travis walks through a gate where he needs to get a ticket to get in and my eye caught the editing. I like how you here the the diegetic sound of the buzzer when he walks through then the movie does short cuts of ""stop"" and then cuts to the ticket that Travis takes. In this same scene the movie uses a few clips of POV. One time when he leaves the store and looks at Charlie T and then right after he leaves it is used again when Travis sees a man on the street.
The scene when Travis is at the shooting range the movie shows Travis shoot and then cuts to the target that he shot and then zooms in quickly to show where he shot on the target.",

The film has something that very few films can ever achieve and that is making the audience feel the world Travis Bickle lives in. You can sense the smell of the city air, be dazed by the city's lights, and be torn apart by the loneliness of every cold and crowded street. You can feel Bickle's sickness with all the pimps and low lives who are able to obtain woman, while he struggles with them in all his efforts. Travis realizes that his life has been lead in one direction that will let him make his imprint on the world before his sad and inevitable end.

Its no surprise that i have never heard to the character refered to as Travis Bickle in conversation, only DeNiro, or Deniro's character.  Either way, his presence on screen is prolific and is reason enough to be interested in his character.  However good the direction is (and it is, the film is shot in a very modern style with fast cuts and odd angles for its time) the story is ultimately lacking...  The story is a huge buildup for little pay-off.  I wonder if this is because the studio and censors would not allow for the big ending we all expect when we watch this movie but for whatever reason it is short and unexplained (and a little unrealistic.)  Before the halfway point i was sure i would love this movie and probably buy the dvd but unfortunately it wasnt what i expected.  Not to take too much away from the film, i still think it was groundbreaking and probably underappreciated but you can't help but wish there was more to it.",

966,18 April 2010,aeboynton,9, Taxi Driver,"This movie showed the damage that being a Vietnam War vet does psychologically (PTSD) and how that affects the rest of this mans life. Robert Deniro was excellent in this roll playing Travis, a Vietnam vet. His character was very well developed and we saw how each part of his life was so affected by his experiences in war. Jodie foster, who plays a 12-year-old prostitute, is trying to be saved by Travis. Travis feels that New York City is full of scum. He see's the violence and corruption in the city during his job and wants to help Jodie Foster's character (Iris) escape her pimp. His own insanity and loneliness causes Travis to lose a connection with people and it is his mission to help Iris. I think that this movie exposed people to the corruption and ""scum"" in New York City at the time. I also felt in some way that it sent an anti-war message to the public. However, this movie also gave people a sense of what war vets go through mentally even after they're home. Sometimes the psychological damage is greater than a physical injury.",

I am one of those who found this movie unexceptionally boring, and even almost felt like it was missing the plot. And no, I did not expect an action movie or huge thrills, I just wanted a story or a morale, and this extremely slow paced movie did nor really give me that. I've seen other reviews state that the lack of 'events' reflect the main characters life, which probably is true. But however cool the thought is, I'd rather watch a story that drags me into a world, rather than one where I can hardly focus on it.",
973,7 May 2018,e-clayton-01810,9, TAXI DRIVER,"First off, the cinematography was great, Robert De Niro was great, and the plot was great. I was all just great! What I like most about the film is it's unique yet mundane plot. Well, Its base is in the mundane life of a New Yorker. It's uniqueness come from these very ""New York"" esque random occurrences. The things that happen in the film are very out-there but could easily happen to any taxi driver in NYC . Its New York! It's a crazy ass city and the film says that perfectly. 
Secondly, I appreciate how the romance wasn't predictable. Anyone accustomed to mainstream film would've expected Cybill Shephard's character to forgive and fall in love with De Niro's character, but she didn't. In a way, that IS what drove the plot. It's interesting because in most film, romance drives the plot, but in this case, a lack of romance is what keeps the story moving. 
I also appreciate how un-Hollywood De Niro's character is. He has the makings of a secondary character due to his odd, quiet, ""no-one-understands-me"" personality. I think it is cool that the main character has such un-likable characteristics. i.e when he stalks Betsy (Shepard) and tells her about herself (which is apparently attractive), or when he threatens to kill her after she stops returning his calls. He is simply a weird guy and I enjoyed that.
In terms of cinematography, I love the initial scene where there are a series of close ups of the taxi itself. I think that was a great choice and an interesting way of making the taxi feel like an actual, independent character. The building of the conflict and resolution were compelling as well. It's like the plot switches up on the De Niro as well as the audience. It's very clever.
At the end of the day, Taxi Driver is a cinematically gorgeous film that illustrates a life not yet seen or understood by the mainstream; a seriously lonely man turned hero in the weirdest, most New Yorker way.",

981,30 August 1999,LouisFriendWA,5, I really can't see it...,"Okay, I have very much respect for the genius of Martin Scorcese, but I really can't see what this movie is all about.  I have seen it only once, but I feel that that is enough to get the overall view of this particular flick.  ""Taxi Driver"" should have been called, ""The Psychotic And Detrimental Effects Of Living In The City And Actually Caring About The World In Which We Live.""  Now, I know that this is exactly what this movie is about, but I don't see the genius in making a movie about it.  The classic scene with DeNiro and his gun (""Are you looking at me?"") is just that...classic.  It shows the level to which his character has descended...he is now in a world where nothing else really matters...his revenge against a world and a system that has screwed him and everyone he meets and sees over too many times.  I got a tad bit lost towards the end and I thought that I was watching a documentary about the negative effects of working in a postal office too long.  I don't know, maybe if I watched it again I could find the hidden qualities and secrets that I seem to have missed on the first viewing.  But for now, I would have to rate ""Taxi Driver"" with Scorcese's other horrid movie, ""U-turn.""  But that is another paragraph or so.             Ciao, Clyde.",

985,27 August 2022,meenmoney,10," Important, Timeless, Masterful","This is an amazing character study and I believe every man should watch this movie at least one time in their life. There is more and more Travis Bickle's walking amongst us in 2022 than in 1973. This is exactly why recent movies like the Joker are as successful as they were. Travis' daily life is super relatable to the average man in this day and age (even though devices were different) and how shallow and empty he is, is played so well by DeNiro. Making a movie with a main character like this was so risky at the time, considering Travis is a background character in most people's lives who isn't important whatsoever. Even for 1973, this movie has some of the best looking shots I ever seen. It's a movie I can see being interpreted in many different ways and it's done in a way where this was intentional. It is so commendable.",

Thankfully, most people love, and my only explanation for those who hate it is that they just don't get it, and probably never will.  Forget the violence - many critics of Taxi Driver simply point to the film as being too violent - and just watch it, soak it in, and really let it get under your skin.  The violence is part of the story, and the story is one that, though it may make you uncomfortable, it does get to you and leave your mind reeling.  Now, That's entertainment!",

Robert DeNiro has already been considered a superstar having done The Godfather Part II. Everything about this story was incredible and Harvey Kietel was great as the pimp of a young prostitute played by at the time a 12 year old Jodie Foster. This movie is just a way of showing what scary things a regular hard working man may see in the late hours of the night at NYC or anywhere else for that matter it just took place in NYC, and he decides he wants to go and clean it up.

993,8 May 2019,owengoldstoff,10, A perfect neo-noir,"Taxi Driver is a spectacular neo-noir, psychological drama. To me, what really made it noir, was the fact that the story is told in the form of a diary of a man who is losing his mind. Even parts without narration can feel this way too, such as when Travis is in his apartment, using a mirror to practice pulling a gun on people. He repeats the saying, ""You talking to me?"" This is Scorsese's way of showing Travis' inner demons are eating away at sanity, and the camera being pointed at his reflection shows that he is only hurting himself. The dim greens, yellows, and browns, and the overall seediness of his apartment's interior almost make you feel like you trapped inside his mind. It's one of films that will keep you uncomfortably drawn in the entire time, as the anxiety of how things will turn continue to build up.",

I have a point which I am confused. That is Travis's mentality. I suppose several months have passed since his crime because his hair is grown. It's true that he killed bad men, but he should be accused of his murder. Furthermore, he didn't know their personality when he killed the people. In spite of everything which he committed, he does work as if he does nothing. I think this situation will drive ordinary people crazy, or they won't be able to do their job just like before.

Mainly due to the universal message: things are bad in the state, it is affected by a disease, like a cancer, spreading to wider and wider circles of society, and it is the duty of a citizen to stand on the side of law, justice and other established values and to express his opposition through vigorous actions. The protagonist of the picture - a former Vietnam War veteran - opposes himself in a specific way. He takes a gun in his hands and intends to use it against what he believes is the source of evil and decay, i.e. The presidential candidate in the next election. A timely assassination attempt thwarted by security causes Travis Bickle (the timeless Robert DeNiro!) to change the object of his ""interest"". He turns to his newly met acquaintances: the Hispanic pimp Sport (good Harvey Keitel) and the place and people associated with the business practiced by the gang. With one exception: not against the juvenile prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster's screen debut), whom he sympathized with and tried to help, including by taking her away from her ""business"" friends and from practicing ""the world's oldest profession.""

Well, I don't think that it turned my world around, but it certainly messed with it. Seeing Robert DeNiro as this lonely and pathetic nightwatcher may be slow paced for some, but it's watching him turn into a demented vigilante that makes it most interesting. It's like watching what goes through every lonely man's mind at some point in his life, but then watching DeNiro carry out these repressed animosities is the part that hit my nerves. Never before has any other film charged my psyche so much. And Scorcese's work on the film really added to that sense of building up so much rage for society. Oh, and just watching DeNiro doing the ""You talking to me?"" scene really sums the feeling up nicely.

1024,25 February 2023,Hikalgo,8, Awesome Robert de niro and a dirty town,"This film is undoubtedly overrated but that does not take away from how great it is since the performances are all good except that of Robert de Niro who seems impressive and outstanding to me, also the shots, the use of the camera, the colors and the blur to isolating through the other people in all the scenes of interaction with the other taxi drivers, regardless of the scene you see between Travis and the other taxi drivers, it is stifling and makes you understand how lonely the protagonist's life is and that with almost no dialogue, obviously it is a film that I recommend and in my opinion. Opinion is a 7.5 out of 10, but I can't do it, so it gets an 8.",

It did start off a bit slow but every movie should instead of diving straight into the action. The music was some of my favorite in any movie, closely behind Interstellar. The characters were written well (skip this sentence, spoiler ahead) and the scene with the man trying to kill his wife was beautifully directed/written. The action seemed forced and rushed but other than that there's not too many bad things to say about this masterpiece of a movie.

I do not understand how we live in a world where 'Django unchained' can be rated higher on IMDb than this classic 70's film. This film has a phenomenal story and score and it's all backed up perfectly by the best director of all time, Martin Scorsese, the best actress of all time, Jodie Foster, and the best actor of all time in the brilliant Robert De Niro. Put them together and you have cinematic perfection. The tension builds from the very start as we realize that Travis Bickle is not an ordinary character and we see him slowly come to the realisation that the world is full of despicable people and needs cleaning up and it all leads to an inevitable climax that is perfectly crafted and soo violently realized. This film is absolute perfection and needs to be recognised more greatly in my opinion.",

1036,7 May 2020,dannymanning,7, Good,"First I should say that I watched Taxi Driver after I watched Joker. I watched Taxi Driver after hearing how Todd Phillips was inspired by that movie when creating Joker. Ultimately what I find different about the two movies is that 'Joker' is a lot more acknowledging to the fact that our protagonist is mentally ill and needs help. I also notice the complete difference in movie scores, while Joker's movie score delivers an award winning powerful score that heightens many of the movies scenes. Taxi Driver's score however is very repetitive and honestly boring. Most of the dialogue is delivered in an even duller way than the music. It's not till the last 40 minutes of the movie where something actually starts to happen. I wouldn't say Taxi Driver is a bad movie but just a little dull. What didn't help the movie in my opinion was that for the first half of the movie Travis Bickle he was portrayed as just being a little slow or dumb but not crazy as he quickly transitions to to the second half.",
1037,16 April 2009,collierja,10," Martin Scorsese's best film, and the best film of motion picture history","Taxi Driver is easily my favourite film of all time. Why? It's simple. Robert Di Nero plays a Vietnam veteran named Travis Bickle, who is emotionally unstable, socially inept, depressed and lonely. He suffers from insomnia and decides to become a taxi driver, working at night shifts from (and I quote) '8 in the evening to 6 in the morning, sometimes 8 in the morning. I work 6 days a week, sometimes 7 days a week. It's a real hassle but at least it keeps me busy.'",
1038,9 April 2007,young_jo,10," One of the seventies best films, De Niro in one of his best roles.","I love case study films, and one of the finest case study films ever to be put on screen is Taxi Driver. Robert De Niro plays Travis, a loner who tries reenter his life after apparently serving his country in Vietnam. He takes up a job as a cab driver who drives in the seediest areas of urban New York city. He is disgusted by the corruption and sleaze around him and wants to do something but doesn't know what. His unbalanced psychosis ultimately leads to unending violence and rage. The taxi cab is a metaphor for loneliness in this film which proves true. All Travis wanted to do was to be a part of something. No man in the world ever wants to be left in society and Taxi Driver is a brilliant portrait of that. Great performances by the supporting cast too which included Cybill Shephered, Jodie Foster, Peter Boyle, Albert Brooks, and Harvey Keitel. Scorsese was great as well. His directorial vision was truly brilliant. Great Movie!",

1041,4 May 2005,bishopdante,9, Travis is psychotic? I'm not so sure,"Travis is certainly alienated. He has no power in his role as a cabbie. All he can do is interact as a subordinate with all of the characters he meets along the way. He listens to them, and is stunned by their mealy-mouthed excuses for why they don't use the power they have in life. This is particularly well illustrated by Scorsese's own role as the jilted husband, and Travis's reaction is that of well hidden disgust. This guy is going to travel in a cab to watch the window and not do anything? It's pathetic. Actually he's there to talk to the cabbie, to stand on the shoulders of a subordinate to bolster his injured ego. The politician near the end is another example of all talk and no action, ego gratification. Travis sees so much vanity and evil on his travels that he finally decides that he's going to do something about it. He's not psychotic, and he isn't insane. He's just reached the breaking point of passivity. He's been lumbered with the passivity of others, and has had passivity enforced upon him by his job. He commits mutiny in order to choose good. He breaks the law in order to become the law. He reflects upon his position (the mirror scene) and is willing to sacrifice himself for the welfare of others, something no other character in the film is prepared to do. The rescue scene at the end is virtually a fairy tale setting, the rescue of an imprisoned princess from the evil pretender to the throne (the pimp). I believe that Travis is indeed a hero, not a man descending into psychosis. He triumphs over the neurosis handed to him on a daily basis by his superiors (employers) and becomes a man capable of choice. It's all about free will, and the ability to choose good, even though the path to good may involve fighting evil with violence. This film is about the weakness and sickness of a falsehood : ""pacifism is the moral high-ground"". It is not. One must commit to one's beliefs. Another fantastic thing is that at the end he's broken the law, and committed murder, but the system is so passive that they uphold him as a hero in the newspaper. Yet Travis is still just a cabbie, and he doesn't take it seriously. He doesn't need the approval of others. He's realised that he doesn't need anything from anybody, and is no longer alone, he's self-sufficient.",

You could just imagine Alex from Clockwork Orange being friends with Travis in this film with the amount of insanity and how they stand by their stance on things 100%. The director, Martin Scorsese has helped direct and produce over 60 films and is known most for this film. It was honestly amazing seeing him work with Robert De Niro in possibly his last film ""The Irishman"". This film is a about a mentally unstable veteran taxi driver named Travis. Travis is fueled by the world around him from politics to prostitutes. He channels this anger through doing what he thinks is right for the world. This movie always keeps me on my toes and is a great rewatch. The movie ties its events very well together and portrays a great story to watch. My only issues with this film is on how the other actors never really left an impact on me.

But besides that everything else in this movie is alright or just meh. I'll start with the score, all I remember is the jazz score that starts off the movie and is played throughout the movie, and sometimes it's just so out of place for the tone of a certain scene, but other than that it's alright. The other thing I forgot to say about the things I liked was the acting, good acting. Anyways another thing I look for in a movie is a theme, but with themes it can't be right in your face or have nothing to do with the story it has to be subtle enough for the audiences to think. In this movie I couldn't think what the theme was, I had to look it up and it was something about ""destiny"" or whatever, but now that it's been a day I kind of get it so the theme is there I guess. I didn't get why he wanted to kill the senator, I mean yeah because he got rejected by that one women that happened to work for his campaign. As I looked up why he wanted to kill him it was because he was a ""father figure"" to the women he got rejected by, even though they never show that, I mean if they did then I don't remember it. Just because you work for someone doesn't mean you look up to them, in fact a lot of people actually hate they're boss. Sometimes the story doesn't make sense but like I said I still enjoyed it and besides that the cinematography and stuff was good. So it bumps up to a 7/10.",

Partly true partly fiction, A walking contradiction""- These lines are the best to describe the character of Travis Bickle as played by Robert De Niro. Yes you guessed it right. Today we are going to review one of the masterpieces of 70's ( not THE MASTERPIECE of 70's ) directed by Martin Scorese - TAXI DRIVER. In one word , the blend of Schrader's script , Scorese's direction and De Niro's performance is both compelling and disconcerting.
STORY
Travis (played by Robert De Niro) is an ex-marine and Vietnam veteran , suffers from Insomnia and lives in isolation in New York City. His Insomnia makes him take a job as a night taxi driver , driving passengers around the city. He used to maintain a diary and often he used to watch pornographic films thinking that is the only type of films existing in this world. ( A note : This film should not be taken as a New York Film , it is not about a city but about the weathers of a man's soul ) Travis becomes infatuated with Betsy ( played by Cybill Shepherd ), a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. After watching her interact with fellow worker Tom through her window, Travis enters to volunteer as a pretext to talk to her, then takes her out for coffee. On a later date, he naively takes her to see a pornographic film, which offends her, and she goes home alone. His numerous attempts at reconciliation by sending flowers and apologizing over the phone are rebuffed, causing him to become embittered and convinced that she is exactly like the ""cold"" people he detests in the city. Rejected by beautiful political aide Betsy after a catastrophic date at one of the ubiquitous porn theatres, Travis becomes ambiguously obsessed with child prostitute Iris (played by Jodie Foster), abused by her pimp Sport (played by Harvey Keitel). The violent pressure inside his skull is made worse by listening to the psychotic fantasies of a creepy passenger, a cameo from Scorsese himself.
That evening, Travis drives to Sport's brothel. Travis shoots Sport in the stomach, causing a shootout to start. He shoots Iris' Time Keeper in the hand, but Sport gets up and shoots him in the neck before Travis guns him down again. Then Iris' customer comes through the door from her room and shoots him in the arm and Travis kills him with the sleeve concealed gun. He is attacked by the Time Keeper again who he stabs through the hand and finally shoots dead before the crying Iris. As the police arrive, Travis attempts to commit suicide, but runs out of ammo. Travis' shootout is seen by the police and press as an attempt to rescue Iris from armed gangsters. He is not prosecuted, and is hailed as a local hero in the press.
He receives a letter from Iris' father, thanking him for saving her and revealing that she has returned home to Pittsburgh, where she is going to school. After weeks of recovery and returning to work, Travis encounters Betsy as a fare. Travis drives her home, then refuses to let her pay the fare, driving away with a smile. As Travis drives off, he becomes suddenly agitated after noticing something in his rear-view mirror. Thus the film ends leaving us to a disturbing picture of social disarray.
CAST :
ROBERT DE NIRO was an excellent choice for the protagonist of the movie. He clearly proved that loneliness is the cancer that allows self destruction to reach its peak. His eyes clearly had an expression of disgust and an aim of removing from the streets of New York. Although he could have run his taxi throughout the cities he preferred to roam around in this nasty lanes of NewYork. His dialogues also had a special significance as his words perfectly fitted his character. There is a scene where he says ""you talking to me?"" Watch this scene and you will fall in love with the MAN. ( Comment down if you want a detailed character sketch of this character and how Todd Phillips got inspired from this movie to make JOKER-2019 ) here's Jodie Foster, chillingly cast as a twelve-year-old prostitute whom Travis wants to ""save.""
DO I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE ?",
1062,3 March 2017,jackfreeman-west,10, A Truly Great Character Study,"The year was 1976, and armed with a budget of around 1.3 million dollars, director Martin Scorsese alongside the phenomenal acting talents of Robert DeNiro and Jodie Foster, crafted what was to become not only one of the greatest character studies of the last half-century, but also one of the greatest films of all time. Nominated for four Academy Awards upon release, the film's popularity has only risen over the years. The continued critical and fan interest in Scorsese's bleak masterpiece is evident, from the countless reviews, to the endless analyses, to the frequent birth of new theories and ideas regarding the film. I myself am among the many who believe that Taxi Driver has had an undeniable influence on cinema today, and that Travis Bickle is one of the most complex and intricately crafted characters we have ever witnessed – or will ever witness – on screen.

I've always found the fact that DiNiro's character was an ex-Marine interesting especially because it is not emphasized at all in the movie. In many ways I think it is as much of an examination of the psyche of soldiers trained to kill as it is a look at loneliness. Just one of the greatest scripts I've ever seen and it is executed brilliantly. The camera work is ground breaking as well. Phenomenal film. I personally believe it to be one of DiNiro's best performances. His use of method is appropriate here.",

The character, Travis Bickles is a loner with psychic problems especially insomnia, and a personality disorder. We have also learned that he is honorably discharged Vietnam veteran. He is a night-shift taxi driver who fails to make a connection with society since everyone is impersonal and cruel to others. The people treat him as an invisible being. In addition, the streets of New York City are corrupted, dirty, and immoral. Travis mentions that he wants someone to clean up the city's corruptness, and votes for the leading candidate for president. Later in the movie, when his girl of dreams, Becky dumps him for the way he acts to her because he thought that Becky was an ""angel"" compare to the dirty citizens of New York and thought that no one should hurt her, but he was wrong. Therefore, he decides to takes revenge on Becky by trying to assassinate the leading candidate for president, which Becky supports largely. Travis arms himself with weapons supplied from a black market, and shaves off his hair on his head. Yet, his assassination plan fails. Thus, he tries to find another way to release his anger by becoming a vigilante. As the film progresses, we begin to learn that Travis has a loath for prostitution, and he begins protecting an underage girl, Iris (played by Jodie Foster) from her abusive lover, ""Sport."" When Iris repudiates Travis's help, Travis becomes infuriated, and uses his anger to attack ""Sport"" and the gangsters in a bloody shoot-out. Eventually, he gets shot, but prevails by killing ""Sport."" At that point, Travis is ultimately claimed as a hero in society when he saves Iris. It is ironic because in the beginning of the movie, he followed the laws of society and acted ""invisible"" to others. However, when he breaks society's laws, he becomes a hero which seems to help him to escape his miserable fate in life. That is one of the themes of the movie: glorification of violence. People start to care for him. Unfortunately, in the end of the film, one can never know if Travis actually died or lived because everyone has their own interpretations. I would say that Travis's triumph is actually a tragedy since we don't know the impossible answers to the questions. He might have died because at the end, it was almost like a dream sequence that played on an emotional level, but we still do not know. The ending is supposed to be enigmatic. Martin Scorsese ended this film that way with no real answers for the ending because the director made the audience cared for Travis Bickles. We wanted to know what really happened to him, so that teaches us a very significant lesson about life. The moral of the film in my opinion was that if humans were impersonal, unfair, and unloving to others, society would deteriorate and fall into chaos in life. Another reason I enjoyed this masterpiece for the reason that it was very gritty, and realistic to the 1970s of New York City. In general, Taxi Driver is a must-see for people who love heavy dramas.",

It is not that the film was unavailable to me or that I was unaware of it. The problem was that I was very settled with the sorts of movies I enjoyed, I thought I only enjoyed old Hollywood classics or human dramas, anything with a slight mention of violence or action would turn me off. So for a very long time I put off seeing Taxi Driver – this was the biggest misjudgement I have made in all my life when it comes to films. When I finally did see Taxi Driver it changed my opinion of cinema and left me feeling very silly for thinking that I could pre-guess what I liked before I had seen it. I had sat down thinking I would get nothing out of the film, however after it had ended I was blown away. Taxi Driver is a highly regarded film but I knew in that moment that this film will never be regarded highly enough.",
1076,13 April 2014,mvpharmcon,9, The knife's edge between damnation and deliverance,"This movie was a tour de force that featured De Niro in his grittiest role outside of Jake LaMotta. In a nutshell, this movie places the taxi driver Bickle on a life path so precarious and narrow that we fail, while watching the movie, to see how there could ever be an opportunity for redemption for this fallen and distressing character. Yet he transcends his descent into hell by the narrowest of margins and comes back into the light based on a single act of obsessive moral decency. The plot creates constant tension and discomfort as we see inside an unbalanced neurotic who becomes a saviour to an innocent. LOL, this review sounds like a religious essay! But I remain, to this day, captivated by the stark story-line. It suggests that if you have even a shred of goodness in you, redemption and deliverance are always possible. Stunning acting, amazing photography. Sparse dialogue. Dark and brooding the whole way through. Highly recommended. Reminds me of Deliverance in its intensity.",

1079,19 April 2019,avanjit-20257,9, A Simple Personal Comment for Mr. Scorsese.,"Taxi Driver is straight-out a neo-noir movie.
The reason I so consistently emphasize on this matter is because of the fact that it actually is, from the mystery-defining soundtrack to the whole concept of fighting a city crime in a sort of a straight-out bang-bang gun fashion is something that you would only see in a noir movie. Of course it's not black and white but, in all other directions, it's a noir movie.
Now the thing about this movie is that it is as personal as it can get to the life of a Taxi Driver, who happens to be played so naturally by De Nior as though you forget for a time-being, what great stature is on the screen and even for that matter, any other well-known actor who appears on the same screen within the elapsed time of the movie has even lesser value of a Hollywood-cultural specific preliminary existence.
My point is that, the movie revolves around the single most important character and his name is Travis Bickle who is kinda like a misfit among the group of people that he's normally seen to be associating with in the movie. To differ with this, as though in a way, to be contradicting this way of life of a regular taxi driver is Travis whose beliefs that whatever a man's occupation may be, he is at least entitled to do whatever he likes as long as it's right by one's own moral standards. This in a way gives him the courage at the first half of the movie to pursue a girl that he feels is the most beautiful thing in the world.
And as far as the script goes, I'd say it can be certified as an A-class script as for its precision to show exactly what kinda fellow Travis Bickel is and what his true intentions are.
The structure of the script is what I would call ""A consistent trip along the highway and while on the way, taking few worthwhile side tracks and a turn-over.""
The taxi driving sequences become the whole 'highway trip thing' while 'side tracks' refers to indulging on various other activities which are not similar yet are all inter-connected to each other, and the 'turn-over' refers to the point where he loses his girl due to an unfortunate side-track trip. Well that's a lot of analogy.
Coming back to the way things work in the movie, I also like the way the movie builds gradually around the character and also the way the character builds around the events that follow in the movie which when chronologically put together is just the consequence of one another.
Also in particular, I'd like to point out the fact that the way the crime-fighting or more of a bang-bang scene ended with a wide shot of the whole lot of gathering people felt like an homage to the late great movie ""Chinatown"" by Roman Polanski.",
1080,23 October 2017,jakemcginnis,8, Great Movie!!!,A must see!!! One of the best films ever made. This took film in a new direction. Perfect cast in front and great work behind the camera. At some points the film does drag on a bit but not a lot of things wrong with this film. Very gritty and realistic. This is what would happen if you really tried to fight crime.,
1081,25 February 2018,bill-36865,8, How a IGNORANT MAN turned into a MAD ONE!!,"Honestly, at first, by no means did I like the character, Travis, starred by Robert De Niro. His ignorance totally made him nothing but a hippie full of stupidity and embarrassment. Neither his dating with Betsy nor his habitual pause with that silly smile could I tolerate for any more in the scene, yet this proves that Robert De Niro did make a great job on the acting. HOWEVER, at the last scene when Travis leaving a cold and numb ""goodbye"" to Betsy without taking the fee for driving, I found Travis my favorite character in the film. Travis is a sarcastic admonishment for modern people who seemingly aren't ignorant, and makes this movie an art of sarcasm. Travis was credited as a hero for saving Iris from a prostitute because of his strong intolerance of ""the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit"", so he ""stood up"". Compared with Palantine, as a symbol of most modern people, all his actions remain watchwords, slogans, and in speeches. All we modern people care about is where the stress should be put in the sentence, ""We are the people"", leaving the true problem gradually turning an ignorant and innocent man into a mad one. Finally this madman committed a serious crime which is so called ""a hero act"" to modern people. See, how sarcastic is this? We all have madness to these problems, yet we hide it instead and presume on some guy like Travis to stand out. In my perspective, what Travis has done and become aren't hero things but nothing more than what a morbid society forces him to do. He brutally killed three men in a federal society and is crowned as a hero. See how mad this society is to the useless politicians. Taxi Driver and taxi drivers, these ignorant people, are both reminders for we modern people not to just maintain the situation but to reform and reinforce it.",

Travis Bickle would have kicked Rocky Balboa's butt in a second. Onto a more artistic commentary.  The writing of Taxi Driver is impeccable, as it is a very personal story from the heart and mind of the brilliant Paul Schrader.  The direction, well, it's Scorcese, so do you need to know anything else? This is one of the consummate films about alienation and urban decay (as paralleled by the inner decay of DeNiro's Bickle).  There have been pretenders to the throne, but anyone who knows an iota about film cannot deny (or is foolish if he or she did) that this disturbing film resides forever in the damaged soul of anyone who has ever felt the slightest bit outside of the moral and social mainstream.",

Anyways, if you have never seen this film and you are a fan of De Niro or of movies in general, you must see this movie.  Harvey Keitel, Cybill Shepard and Peter Boyle also give strong performances, but watch out for a young Jodie Foster who plays a 12 year old hooker in the film (If not for De Niro, Foster totally steals the film).

It captures perfectly the Hell that Man inflicts on his fellow Man, but also the Hell a man (Travis) inflicts upon himself. It doesn't feel linear, or even coherent. Put simply, one feels when watching this Movie that the plot is secondary, expendable even. If Travis had just taken a different route one night, an equally unpleasant story would have arrived, and manifested itself in pretty much the exact same way. It's the characters, mirror images of the Us we must ignore to function, that make this so fascinating. The Film seems initially uncertain, part character sketch, part love story, part crime drama. Really though, it's all about one man: Travis Bickle. This man's disassociation with Life and general misanthropy could have seen him be a pivotal figure in 1976's emerging Punk Rock scene, but instead we find him a mentally unstable, ex-Nam vet. Forget violence, sex, drugs, Travis is the most frightening thing in this Movie. Analytic to an agonizing degree, derision and loathing flow freely, heaped upon the decadent underbelly of NYC. Travis's diary detail his justification for wanting to ""flush this city down a f*****' toilet"", but as later exploits reveal, Travis has no higher moral ground: he's an unhinged maniac, and any channel to express this frustration, anger, fury will be seized, instantly. Any target is enough, be they depraved scum or Political Leader. ",

And not because of Scorsese though he is one of the best. Not either because of DeNiro, also one of the best. It's because of an extremely underrated writer and director: Paul Schrader. The film is basically about loneliness. Travis Bickle is completely isolated from society. He lives in his own world: taxies, porn movies and taxies again. The relationships with Betsy and Iris are what really moves Travis. With Betsy he wants to integrate in this society, feel part of it, although he already has the idea of "" cleaning up the whole mess.....and flush it down the f**kin' toilet "". With Iris, this idea is more of a reality. He wants to save the prostitute from hell. In this way, we could see the influence of greek mithology ( orpheus and Eurydice ) in Taxi Driver, although it has many other clear influences such as The nausea, Sartres existencialist novel or The Searchers, John Ford's western.

But when he talked, he was quite alright. The thing uneasy about him was that he carried a toady smile in his face when talking to strangers, e.g. to the body guard/FBI of the Senator. That was probably from long time isolation. He was a veteran, but of course the movie says nothing directly about the war he experienced, whether it caused his mental unstableness etc. In fact, he was only 26 when retired from the war. Still too young to be a bitter person right away. Well, he was kind of bitter, when talking to the girl he was wooing at about her male coworker, and to the child prostitute about the gangster. He talked mean about man when was with a girl he liked. He talked mean about them when he didn't know them. Of course, I am not saying the gangster was any good. On the contrary, the producer of the movie was not making any judgment during the entire show. He didn't judge whatever Travis was doing right or wrong, nor what the Senator was doing, nor the prostitute, nor her parents. I don't know which side the Senator was on. In fact, that politician was only a small chess piece in this guy's emotional world. He would wish him success or planning to assassinate him only because of his tension with the girl he was wooing at. In fact, the movie says he was not listening to the politician, and did not mention whether the politician was listening to him or not. (a different way to say no to politician in the 70s than ""Forrest Gump"" would, milder, but same ironic.)",

1135,30 March 2015,rj522,9," A Powerful, Psychological, Must-see Classic.","I find it important to go back and watch movies that came out before the present day. It's very interesting to compare parts of the movie to the events during that film's time period. Additionally, some of the best movies came out well before the birth of the modern generation. This is a masterpiece by director Martin Scorsese. I believe that Taxi Driver is one of those movies that you have to see. It features one of the best actors of all-time in his prime; Robert De Niro makes a stunning performance as the character ""Travis Bickle"". You can look deep into his role from a psychological perspective. Travis Bickle is a Vietnam-War veteran who seems to suffer from serious depression and insomnia. To cope with this, Bickle becomes a taxi driver who drives night and day. He doesn't carry much of a social life and even separates himself from his passengers. When he's not picking up fares, he is watching XXX movies. When Bickle falls for Cybill Shepherd's character ""Betsy"" he watches her from outside until deciding to go into the poll office and ask her out. He later takes her out on a date in which they go to a XXX movie. Betsy is disturbed and never talks to him again. This is a perfect example of how the war negatively affected him and has made him incapable of proper social interaction. Another thing is how deeply affected he is by seeing Jodie Foster's character ""Iris"" be thrown around like a piece of property. He isn't just disgusted by it, he is sickened with her pimp ""Sport"" and holds a grudge against him. Later in the movie Bickle leaves Iris money before he attempts to assassinate the Senator. After the assassination plan fails, Bickle storms in the brothel on a vendetta and eventually kills Sport, among other gangster characters. All of these events occur because Bickle has a rather special hatred for people he doesn't agree with. Beside the psychological terms, it is just overall an interesting movie with Robert De Niro at his best. Some parts of the movie are iconic as well; like when Bickle is standing in the mirror at his apartment and coins the phrase ""You talking' to me?"". That scene in itself is excellent because Martin Scorsese told De Niro to improvise and that was the result.",

No matter how often I see it I cannot move until the final credit has passed. In Travis Bickle we see a character as dark and moody as the setting. While sympathising with the character I also was given a wake-up call in....oftentimes the dark loner is portrayed on film as being something to strive for, a romantic ideal even, but within Travis we see the darker, more realistic side of things. A life of isolation can lead to one losing touch with reality and becoming so introverted as to almost fail to function as human being. This is most evident when Travis takes Betsy to a dirty movie and doesn't understand why she is so upset by it. To sum up, an outstanding essay on the darker side of the human condition.",

It shows pedophilia and child prostitution, and says, ""Don't be afraid because of us!""

The point of view we get to see is Travis point of view. I don't know about others but I can understand Travis anger and that he wants to change something. I think that Paul Schrader did an amazing job to show how disgusting it was to live in New York at this time. I feel like I have an understanding even if I wasn't alive at this time and still haven't visited New York. And we can't forget how iconic the movie and some of the quotes/scenes that is shown. My favorite scene is when Travis is building his gear. But the most iconic scene is when he is standing in the mirror and saying ""you talkin to me?"". I think that almost everyone has heard that quote at least once in their lifetime.

1163,6 December 2006,toolboxmurder,10, For men exclusively,"For any man who has ever felt lonely, excluded or unwanted this is the film for you. I have viewed this film repeatedly and would recommend it to anyone with half a brain in their head. I won't bore you with a mindless summary of the film's plot, but rather include some personal observations that I as a white male living in contemporary times feels. I can relate to Travis' racism; his outsider feelings that basically suffocate him from the outside world. So often in films do directors and writers wish to portray blacks as some sort of innocent little lambs that require our pity or as victims of a horrible set of circumstance. Not in this film, instead we see blacks pimping, stealing, ravaging, ranting and basically screwing up in every conceivable way. In one scene specifically Travis is pointing his pistol at a television screen of a black male dancing with a white female on ""American Bandstand"" and repeatedly thumbing back the hammer to fire. This coincides with a similar scene in which a passenger (Martin Scorsese himself) glows with anticipation of shooting his wife and her black lover with a 44. caliber magnum, and revels in the very fact of his own hatred, desperation, and jealously. I myself have felt a sort of alienation from women of my own race and sometimes wonder if their is a vast, deep-seeded feminine conspiracy as Travis himself states ""She is just like all the others, cold and distant.""

1164,15 February 2010,Tongera,10, A great movie from Scorsese and De Niro,"This is a great film from Scorsese and De Niro, about a taxi driver's obsession for a teenage girl and his descent into insanity in New York City, the film portrays Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) as a former marine and he has many problems such as being a loner, possibly suffering from some sort of post traumatic mental problem and suffers from chronic insomnia, and to cure that chronic insomnia he takes a job as a taxi driver at night and spends his days in seedy theatres, anyway when he meets Iris (Jodie Foster) he decides he wants to help her and clean up the streets, which leads up to the famous ""you talking to me?"" scene and the shootout in the house. The ending i believe is one of the best in films, as Travis Bickle is lying on the couch after being shot you have to wonder whether Travis was dreaming, still alive or hallucinating? I think the film has career defining performances for Robert De Niro and Jodie Foster who were both nominated for the Oscars, the best performance though comes from Robert De Niro as the disturbed taxi driver in one of the greatest film of the 1970's. The other great thing about this movie is the atmosphere, especially during the night scenes and the cab scenes, which should have been nominated for an Oscar for cinematography, but sadly wasn't despite how great it was.",
1165,17 December 2003,dankatino,10," Impeccable Masterpiece, Scorsese´s dark poetry","In this brillant movie the creators (Scorsese-Schrader) introduced strong parameters to invert the way to see good and evil. The principal character (Travis / Robert De Niro) could be a `hero' and at the same time be completely evil, it depends our point of view. Robert De Niro composed one of his best roles, memorable, anthological. And there´s another way to observe the movie: the religious way. Catholic God becomes very upset and sent a Revenge Angel to put the order of the human world again on the way. New York, considered one of the first cities of the `New World', is the perfect place to show how the human beens lost his spiritually. Travis -first taciturn and polite- becomes the eyes of the spectator, our eyes, and then he start suffering like Christ but he can´t stand this, so he turned to be the hand of Spiritual Justice. He do all `we want to do' when we saw the scum of the streets, the lies of the politics or a woman so ungrateful: Kill with the Sword of Justice. But he is a man, he is an ex-marine who was in Vietnam´s Inferno for his Ungrateful Country, a poor simple boy with nothing to do... except one thing. He can `see' the things with innocence and perspective at the same time. The Cab is his `house' and the Night his be st moment -a spirit of the night-, he has a name but it seems that he came from nowhere. He is real and a ghost at the same time. Each tackle is a personal problem to solve for Travis, each person became his personal difficult task to do. The camera an the edition are both technically perfect showing the particular character´s behaviour. The eyes of Scorsese an his personal way of filming show early evolution, complexity and subtle. With this film one of the best american (and wolrdwide) directors composed a remarkable movie.",

1167,13 May 2014,lindamillerpt,10, One of my favorites.,"Taxi Driver is Martin Scoresese's best film as far as I am concerned, possibly tied with Goodfellas. It is so hard to review a film like Taxi Driver because there is so much good about it. First of all it paints a portrait of one of the most memorable characters in cinema history as far as I am concerned, that being the portrait of Travis Bickle, played masterfully by Robert Deniro. What an incredible actor Robert Deniro is. He is definitely one of my favorites, and he gives one of his best performances in Taxi Driver. This is a film about a lonely man, and it is illustrated so well as such because Robert Deniro is in almost every single scene in this film. The film deals with him, and only him. The only other characters that the film includes are only as a result of Travis running into them or coming into contact with them, and even when other characters are on screen, the story still remains completely about Travis and very little about the other characters. That makes this film a very simple film. This is not a complex story with multiple story lines. It is a simple story about one man, but that quality makes this film extremely effective. This film is also very much left up to your own interpretation, which is something that I absolutely love in films. An example would be when Travis is talking to the soon-to-be president in the back of his taxi cab and he talks about ""cleaning up New York's streets."" You can think of what he means by that in whatever way that you want. As I said, the acting in this film is incredible by Robert Deniro, but also Jodie Foster brings an outstanding performance to this film as well, playing the twelve year old prostitute, Iris. The direction of this movie and the script writing are also fantastic, and are just a few of the things that make this film incredible. This film also has one of the best endings that I have ever seen. If you have never seen Taxi Driver, do yourself a favor and watch it. It is short, effective and unforgettable. One of my favorite films ever, and also in my opinion one of the best films ever made.",

In fact, I think this film could be reduced to a thirty minute show and have greater impact. This is not a film I would watch a second time, and why it's listed in the top 250 is beyond me. Granted, whats his face is a great actor and he did as well as he could with this film. I enjoyed seeing a young Jodie Foster. That's about it. 6/10.",

What you really have is a man who went to war, survived, came back to civilization but remained a soldier. Soldiers are taught to fight and protect. Travis remained a soldier when he returned as a taxi driver and saved a young girl from the streets. We call him a hero because he saved her. We call him an anti-hero because he murdered. But to Travis it's not murder, it's war. In war you find your spot, you watch and pick out your enemies, then you prepare to combat knowing that a soldier must learn to fight with one thought in his mind: fight not for survival but for the benefit of others. Travis did that.",

Best part in this film of course the mirror scene 'are u talking to me?' a memorable yet important scene in the film to show the thinking of Travis. The worst part is, well i cant actually remember a dull scene but of course the most shocking scene must be the part where the man talks about the girl prostitute and the sexual implications brought forth in the dialogue show us the true scene behind the minds of such disgusting people.",
1178,28 September 2018,mail-07821,8, Ambiguous,"I don't like violent or depressing films, but even I could see greatness in Taxi Driver. For example, it wouldn't have been as great without the music, which gave it a very noir feeling at times, without beating the noir idea to death. And some of the 'atmospheric' shots, like the taxi driving through steam billowing out of a manhole, were really excellent - but only because the music was appropriate. And the final scene, where we view Betsy symbolically fading into the darkness, was pure noir ending to me. 'Maybe next time, Baby, if you're good.' But speaking of that scene, I was confused. When shot-up Travis was leaning back on the couch, I looked closely, wondering 'Is he dying, or isn't he?' And incidentally I wondered why the policeman didn't shoot Travis, since he was holding a gun, but then maybe policemen weren't quite as trigger-happy in those days. When the movie picked up after the excellent crime scene street view zoom-out, showing Travis talking to his buddies, I thought 'Hey, what's going on here? Isn't he dead?' And then when Betsy (Cybill Shepard) shows up, and she acts like maybe she regrets rejecting Travis, I'm thinking, wait a minute, this is seriously not likely! So then I had to Google 'What's with the ending to Taxi Driver?', and find that some think it's Travis's dying dream sequence, while Scorsese says it shows that people viewed Travis as a hero for shooting gangsters. To me that would be his way of emphasizing how screwed up things were. And supposedly the final bit where Travis reacts to something in his rear view mirror suggests that he may flip out again. So which is it? Dead, or alive? I'm pretty sure the answer is 'both'. I think Scorsese was hedging his bets, very cleverly (and incidentally leaving open the possibility of a sequel). First, Travis could have been dying after the shootout, but it wasn't clear - which I think was intentional. Those who feel Travis should die in the gun battle he started can believe the ending is a dream sequence (especially since it plays out like a dream sequence), while those who like the idea of instant justice can believe it's not. Sometimes ambiguity is just what you need.",

The cinematography feels fluid, accomplished through a carefully considered combination of great framing, camera angles, camera pans, and what seems to be a deliberately slow pacing. While these techniques are particularly effective in Act 1, because it allows viewers to get an intimate feel for the characters and the gritty atmosphere of 70's New York, however, in my opinion, it dulls Acts 2 and 3 quite noticeably. It is at these parts of the movie when my connection with the main character, Travis, weakened considerably. I feel the latter half of the movie could be improved if it moved just a bit quicker.",

Second only to Goodfellas, Taxi Driver will undoubtedly be one of the best movies you will ever see. The bloodbath is gruesome, sloppy, and real,unsurpassed by any film I have yet seen. The muted color in this scene makes the fulfillment of Travis's violent fantasies seem even more like a horrific nightmare than it already is. Travis himself is plagued by loneliness, and it eventually drives him mad, hence the bloodbath. The movie is a series of failed attempts to reach out and to find some significance in his life. De Niro's performance as Travis is chilling and unforgettable. The musical score sets a perfectly mellow tone for the movie. It's like the kind of music you would listen to on a rainy day. As I said in my summary, brilliant is too mild a word to describe this movie. Get this movie and watch it. Then watch it again. Then watch it ten more times.

The unusual angles of the shots in a couple of places ... when he's standing outside watching from a distance at the political rally we only see Travis from the chest down in his military jacket as he calmly pops a pill from a perscription bottle, then cam suddenly moves up to show his closely shaved, exposed head that is now sporting a punk mohawk, suprises every time. Towads the end the above scene shot filmed of the crime scene as the cam moves and actors are frozen mid movement as we take in all that has just happened w a slow pan is unique to say the least. I was shocked and sad to see he tries shooting himself about 6 or 7 times in front of the child with the pimps guns but no bullets left in the chambers. Just clicks. Eeery. Earlier we see him handling the merchandise from the dapper, energetic salesman in a hotel room, where Travis seems to be acting in a calm, normal manner even though he buys like 5 different firearms, including a 44 Magnum. The same type Scorseses character sais hes going to use on the silouette of a woman standing in a window, who happens to be his wife. We see Travis practicing with his new guns, getting prepared at a shooting range and in his seedy apartment to wreak carnage somewhere yet unknown to the viewer. Then we see the same guns in slow screen shots not in all their glory, but having been dropped on the filthy floor in the house of ill repute, not being used as intended.

I understand that for some people, like my mother who enjoys 40s films w/ Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, Taxi Driver would be distasteful and unworthy of viewing. But beyond the violent scenes and disturbing dialogues (and certainly monologues) this film has wonderfully artful camera shots, angles and pans. Also, Bernard Herrmann's score, with equal parts tense and soothing melodies, is beautifully woven throughout the movie, usually over montages of street and taxi scenes during Travis' confessional periods at which point he laments the city and his own solitude and lack of direction. Paul Schrader's simple, yet emotionally complex screenplay, is followed very loyally by Scorsese. With great acting from Jodie Foster, Cybil Sheperd, Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle, Albert Brooks and most certainly an amazing performance by Robert De Niro, Taxi Driver is one of the greatest films of all-time.

1222,2 May 2009,Cujosh,10, Hell on Wheels,"Perhaps the most formally ravishing-as well as the most morally and ideologically problematic-film ever directed by Martin Scorsese, the 1976 Taxi Driver remains a disturbing landmark for the kind of voluptuous doublethink it helped ratify and extend in American movies. Of all Scorsese's movies, Taxi Driver is for me the most seductive, though I wouldn't call it either his best film (I'd choose the underrated The King of Comedy) or his most gut-wrenching (I'd pick Raging Bull). Most of the glamorous depictions of hell on earth and odes to stoical despair about a post apocalyptic civilization found in monuments to capitalist-urban squalor, including Blade Runner and Seven, can be traced back to Taxi Driver, and if it continues to exert an enormous claim on our imagination, this is surely because we continue to live in its vengeful, puritanical fantasies-as well as with the dire consequences of those fantasies.",

1225,1 November 2009,jmartintech,7, HUNM246-F1WW - Taxi Driver,"Robert DeNiro plays Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran who takes a job drive a taxi around city. During Travis's time behind the wheel he becomes obsessed with the low life scum that haunts his city (Phillips & Scorsese, 1976). As the movie progress's Travis starts to lose touch with the real world and becomes determined to rid his city of crime and corrupt politicians. Travis finds his out let in the form of a twelve year ago prostitute, Iris (Jodi Foster), whom he tries to save (Phillips & Scorsese, 1976). This is a dark film that looks at the under below of society, a film that is terrifying in one sense. Yet this film could also be a statement to those of us that are in high power, city or state government. It shows that just one person with little care for himself/herself can, and very well may take the law into his/her own hands. Taxi Driver is a wonderful look into the minds of people who just have had enough, enough of the lies, enough of people not trusting people. This film also looks into the minds of those people that are part of the crime; they are part of the reason why Travis wants to clean up the city. During one scene in the film Iris jumped into Travis cab and told him to drive, just get her out of there (Phillips & Scorsese, 1976). You can tell by the lighting of that scene that Martin Scorsese wanted to keep Iris face and even her age a mystery, of the views and from Travis. But by the time Travis could leave Iris's pimp, Sport (Harvey Keitel), grabbed her out of the cab and forced her to leave. Then later on Travis finds Iris, and tries to convince her to leave, leave her Sport, leave the city, just go back home. But Iris is so lost in the world of drugs, pain, and mind tricks, she believes that Sport loves her and will take care of her (Phillips & Scorsese, 1976). Travis Brickle tried turning to Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris), a politician who was running for the primary, so he may have his chance winning the Presidency. But just like many politician's then and now he danced around the question, stating that it is harder then Travis may think to change the city, even the county (Phillips & Scorsese, 1976). Between Charles Palantine and Iris, Travis had lost control of himself, lost himself to the other side of the law. Travis tried to murder Charles Palantine, and when that failed he turned his mind towards Iris (Phillips & Scorsese, 1976). As long as there is crime, filth, and corruption in life Taxi Driver will be a classic. Taxi Driver is a film that, hopefully will never driver somebody to become Travis, the crazed hero of his city.",
1226,4 November 2009,patrickdiana,7, A Provocative Ride to Happiness,"One of Robert De Niro's greatest of all time. And I had many reservations about this film prior to viewing. I was definitely surprised of the real complexity of the movie. Travis Bickle is a depressed loner/taxicab driver who spends many of his nights healing his mind with sexual pleasures. He becomes fascinated with the beautiful Betsy played by Cybill Shephard only to get rejected because of his own mistakes. He becomes enraged and violent which coincidently leads him to save the life of a convenience store owner. It was after this when he met the young and misunderstood Iris (Jodie Foster). He spent his time trying to figure out why such a young innocent soul could turn to such darkness. This becomes his objective, to save the life of a teenage prostitute who has no one in the cold streets of New York. Robert De Niro coined one of his most famous phrases in this film, ""You Talking to Me?"" Great Film! I would recommend it to anyone.",
1227,10 February 2012,Nithin-Sukumaran,9, A Definite Scorsese!,"Taxi Driver is one of the best films of '70s. The Film is like a virus that comes into your mind, you could never forget. Robert DeNiro's Performance as Travis, Direction By Scorsese, Script By Paul Schradner makes this film - A True Classic! Like Roger Ebert Said, The Film Is like a nightmare and it will not tell us completely what it was. The Dark, Gloomy Atmosphere of Taxi Driver with the incredible performance by DeNiro, has placed this film on the Top.",
