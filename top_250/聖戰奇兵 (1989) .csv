0,16 October 2015,ivo-cobra8,10, The third entry in the installment is one of the best Indiana Jones series.,"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) is an Action Classic adventure better film than Temple of Doom , is still the best follow up in the trilogy and clever. It is also the greatest sequel of all time. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies of all time. I love this movie to death. ",/

2,23 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, The best of the Indiana Jones trilogy,"Indiana Jones, the man, the legend, the whip. Everyone I know has seen at least one of the Indiana Jones movies and usually Raiders of the Lost Ark is their favorite. Now I loved Raiders of the Lost Ark, I also really loved Temple of Doom even though it gets a lot of hate for it's darkness. But The Last Crusade is my favorite of the trilogy and the strongest in my opinion. For goodness's sake we have Sean Connery as Indiana's father, how could we get any better than that? I love his way of saying ""Junior!"", always gets me in a good chuckle. Harrison Ford still has that same Indy charm that swoons the ladies, the adventure that captivates the guys and takes us on an incredible journey that we'll never forget.",e

5,11 May 2006,ReelCheese,10, Top-Notch Entertainment,"Everything clicks in this action-packed cliffhanger. In his third (and what for years what thought to be his last) adventure, Indy is on the hunt for that ultimate treasure, the Holy Grail. Along the way he must contend with Nazis, a secret brotherhood and, of course, snakes. Sean Connery is a wonderful addition as Indy's father, and the chemistry between he and star Harrison Ford may just be one of the best in film history. The movie is a true rarity in that its attempts to outdo each preceding chase sequence succeed. Though children might have trouble interpreting the plot, this crusade is one people of all ages will enjoy.",e
6,24 March 2002,jhaggardjr,10, Outstanding finale (or is it the finale?),"""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" was supposed to be the final movie in the ""Indiana Jones"" series. At least that's what director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas said at the time this film hit theaters. But now they've said there will be a fourth ""Indiana Jones"" film. I really don't know if that's a good idea, because the ""Last Crusade"" was a fitting end to a great movie series. Harrison Ford returns for his third go around as swashbuckling hero Indiana Jones, this time accompanied by Sean Connery as Indy's father, Dr. Henry Jones. These two actors work beautifully together as they fight off the Nazis in search for the Holy Grail. Two actors from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" reprise their roles to great effect in ""Last Crusade"": Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah. Alison Doody is the heroine (good or bad?); Julian Glover is the villain; River Phoenix portrays a young Indy at the beginning to see how this character really got his start. ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" not only has great characters, it also has a decent story (taking place in 1938), plus exciting action scenes and special effects. It's better than the second film ""Temple of Doom"" and comes very close to topping the first film ""Raiders"". The ""Indiana Jones"" series should stay right where it is with the ""Last Crusade"" as the finale. Unless Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford can prove us wrong and make a really good fourth film in the series, we shall see. I loved all three movies in the ""Indiana Jones"" series. If the fourth film does gets made, I hope it'll be equally as good as the first three.",w

Of course, that's largely to facilitate the addition of a new supporting character (Sean Connery in a wonderful casting as Indy's long lost father, who we'll get to in just a moment) but that extra layer of nostalgia, wrapped around a property that's deeply nostalgic in the first place, manages to avoid numerous pitfalls and serve as an effective prologue. River Phoenix performs especially well as the young Jones, expertly wearing Harrison Ford's mannerisms throughout the long callback, and somewhere along the way we get a worthwhile genesis for the grown-up version's affinity for leather jackets and fedoras.",e
21,14 December 2021,gab-14712,10, The Original Trilogy Ends With a Bang!,"To put it simply, I loved Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. After the darker Temple of Doom, Steven Spielberg wanted to bring back the lightheartedness that made Raiders of the Lost Ark such an endearing classic. He succeeded and nearly even topped the first film in sheer joy and adventure. Might as well call the two adventures even in my book. The film has amazing set pieces (the rat scene in Venice among others). What I really liked the most? The introduction of Dr. Henry Jones, Indiana's father, played beautifully by Sean Connery. Through most of the film, Harrison Ford and Connery have such a strong rapport together and their arcs intersected in the best possible way. Indiana Jones beating up Nazi thugs in Raiders was a treat. Why not have him do it again, so Nazis are our main villains once again. For a brief moment, Indiana comes face-to-face with Adolf Hitler in such a chilling sequence at a book-burning rally. Finally, I loved how they chase after the Holy Grail. As someone fascinated by this type of history (The Crusades, Holy Grail, etc), another reason is given to me to be hooked into the story. Kudos to Steven Spielberg to directing one of the best trilogies of all time (although there is obviously now a fourth). If there was no fourth film, the ending is poignant and a perfect sendoff for our hero.",f

23,17 December 2022,ThomasColquith,10, A Masterpiece of Religious Iconography and Christian Dogmatics,"I have long loved ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" and it currently sits at number 2 on my Top 250 movie list and I rate it a 10/10. This third Indiana Jones movie is such a unique and special film and story which is paradoxically simple yet complex, breezily covering some of the most important issues of life and faith as well as addressing tangentially various relationships. The pace is proper and the story covers a lot of ground in 2 hours. The beginning, middle, and end are all excellent and the cinematography is top notch, the colors and settings are beautiful and varied. The direction is superb, as is the writing. The music is also proper, not being overbearing. In fact the whole film is very easy to watch, not giving one a headache or throwing too much at the audience at one time. The acting is all great as well, the late Sean Connery makes a terrific father and the relationship between the father and son seems realistic and developed, as is the more complicated relationship with the woman, but I won't give away any spoilers.",=

26,15 April 2022,SafReviews,7, The best of the trilogy,This is definitely better than the other two movies in the trilogy in my opinion. The plot was intriguing right for the start till the end and the actions scenes were pretty good and thrilling. Certain parts of the plot were questionable such as finding the secret tunnel in the library which felt too easy and not realistic. I liked the character of Indiana's dad who had a good personality which made the movie better and funnier.,_
27,3 September 2010,TheLittleSongbird,9, Not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark but an improvement on Temple of Doom,"Raiders of the Lost Ark was absolutely brilliant, while Temple of Doom was pretty good if disappointing. The Last Crusade improves on Temple of Doom while just lacking the brisk efficiency of Raiders. It looks fabulous and has a great music score. The script is deliciously witty especially with the interplay between Ford and Connery, and the story is engaging. The action is epic, and I liked the neat sequence at the beginning that explains things such as Indy's fear of snakes and how he got the scar on his chin. Steven Spielburg does an excellent job directing, while both Harrison Ford and Sean Connery(in a masterstroke of casting) are perfectly cast as Indy and Indy's father. On the whole, exciting, witty and fun. 9/10 Bethany Cox",u

30,6 April 2002,dwpollar,7, Fun action and witty dialogue abound...,"1st watched 4/6/2002 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Steven Spielberg): Fun action and witty dialogue abound in this final(we think...) episode in the Indiana Jones three-some.  What this movie lacked as far as special effects it didn't lack in the witty charm brought to the screen by the pairing of Connery & Ford.  From the very beginning to the end it's hard to keep your eyes of the screen following these outrageous adventures and that's the allure of this series.  This film actually tried to put some serious spiritiual overtones into the storyline by searching for the Holy Grail(the cup that Jesus drank from at the last supper) and the myth that it would give everlasting life to those who drank from it.  There are the usual puzzles and hoops that Indiana has to go through to finish this journey(which make no sense from a realistic perspective), but it's obvious from the very beginning that we're watching an un-realistic hero in a movie and that's okay.  All in all this one is a fun ride for the movie-goer which is the ultimate purpose in this one by the ever-entertaining Steven Spielberg.",
31,13 April 2019,carletonclements,10, Easily the Best,"Who are the morons that say the first Indiana Jones movie is the best? Have they entirely missed The Last Crusade? Adventurous? Tick.

33,31 March 2021,Bored_Dragon,8, X marks the spot,"The third film about the adventures of Indiana Jones brings us everything we expected based on the previous two. Plus the outstanding Connery in the role of Indiana's father. The quest for the Holy Grail brings us a two-hour adventure full of action and humor, medieval knights, a fatal blonde, Hitler, camels, and a tank. Perhaps the best in the trilogy.",
34,1 January 2023,VikingBurialService,9, Best in the Series,"By Far my favorite entry in the Indiana Jones trilogy (We'll ignore crystal skull and later media...) Basically, Indiana Jones has to track down his missing father and find the Holy Grail before the Nazis do. I think this movie takes the fantastic pacing and plot of the previous two movies, perfects them, and adds a whole bunch of improvements to the dialogue and scenery. The action isn't quite as fast-paced as Temple of Doom, but it's faster than Raiders. The movie earns its slower scenes of emotional connection - especially between indiana and his father. They feel like a moment of breath-catching between the tension. I also felt the dialogue was less quippy than in previous entries. Not every line felt like it was hammering me over the head with exposition, and there were some clever/funny ones that took a moment of thinking to get (like when his dad said, ""She talks in her sleep,"" or when Indiana said, ""No Ticket""). I also think this movie gets around a lot more than the other two. Raiders stays in the Ark excavation for about ½ the movie, and Temple of Doom takes place almost entirely in the temple. This movie goes from America, to Venice, to Scotland, to Germany, to Petra, and doesn't spend too much time in any one spot. It never felt like there were scenes being reused, and the chases/action felt like they took place across a broader space. Overall, this will always be me (and I think my dad's) favorite jones flick.",
35,28 November 2004,franklstein,10, A truly great feel good film,"The second sequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark is an awesome, beautifully crafted film, and arguably the best of the Indiana Jones trilogy. The film is funnier, classier and far more laid back than the other two woody story lines, mostly because of the introduction of the excellent Sean Connery as Indy's eccentric father. Spielberg and Lucas get back on track after their off the rails first sequel in which to many peoples' horror had none of the Nazis or characters that made Raiders so unique, however, what Spielberg does to make this film a classic is the use of historical data with the swashbuckling storyline of adventure and action. Not to mention that this may well be the greatest feel good film ever made...",

40,18 March 2008,Robert_duder,8, The series take a different path which still works thanks to the cast mostly,"Many consider The Last Crusade to be the best in the series. And many attribute Sir Sean Connery's performance as the staunch and proper Dr. Henry Jones Sr. as the turning point in the series and really makes it terrific. I have a slightly different take on both of those aspects. The Last Crusade is still a worthy part of the series and definitely is not ""worse"" than any of the others. I just don't believe it's any better either. In fact for me it kind of steered away from the core idea of Indiana Jones bring a gritty action adventure. Yes the film has action and adventure but also feels a little Hollywood with some smart comedy, one liners, bigger cast, bigger budget, and less historical viewpoint despite the idea behind the film. A lot of the film is Indiana rescuing his father from the Nazi's which is a completely different take on the series and a classic moment is Hitler himself signing Indy's book in Berlin. While I do think Sean Connery being added to the cast was a great decision I also think his character and therefore him was overused. It was like they were trying really hard to breath new life into the series and I don't think it needed it. It seemed to leave behind the homage to the 40's serials, and the campiness in exchange for big budget spectacles.",

Everything is absolutely on point: Harrison Ford has the character absolutely fleshed out at this point, the chemistry with the amazing Sean Connery is perfect, wring is on point (unlike the previous two; 30 years later the humor doesn't feel dated at all) and the directing is the directing is top shelf Spielberg.

In terms of popularity, this third installment comes somewhere in between its two predecessors. I saw a bit of ""Last Crusade"" on TV, starting near the end of the film, as a kid. I think this was around 1993, but I didn't know what I was seeing at the time. After all these years, I've finally found out that it was this 1989 action adventure I was seeing. While it didn't do much for me years ago, and I was too young for it at the time (one MIGHT wonder why it didn't really frighten me), watching it from start to finish twenty years after its release was not an experience to forget.",
46,3 November 2020,grarunkumar1994,10, This is how sequels should be made.,"The best film of Indiana Jones series.
Raiders of Lost Ark was an introduction and Temple of Doom was meh.
But this is a masterpiece. Perhaps the main factor that contributes to this movie is the infinitesimally charismatic Sean Connery and his interaction with Ford on screen.
Connery, the original Bond, was equally good in comic roles too, which was a pleasant surprise.
Spielberg went full on Spielberging throughout the film - spectacular visuals, a bit of VFX, fantastic practical effects, continuous shots and flawless story telling- 10/10 in film making.
Honestly it is surprising how amazing the action scenes were choreographed 40yrs back with little CGI and gave us gush of adrenaline throughout. Film making went down the drain with CGI vomits which neither looks good nor makes it interesting.
Even the sequel Kingdom Of Crystal Skull from same team was pathetic. One of the worst movies ever made. I refuse to believe that was a work of Spielberg.",
47,9 February 2012,johnnyboyz,7, Refreshing and uplifting yarn which goes above and beyond what is expected of it; a fine effort that hits all the marks for which it aims.,"How often does a third entry to an American produced English language franchise, often worked to spin money irregardless of the critical consensus, sag and just generally disappoint? It is, in that case, a great credit to the team behind this, the third Indiana Jones film of 1989 entitled ""The Last Crusade"", and the fact they done what they've done in creating something as fun and as refreshing as what we've got. We've all been here before, what with the then-latest hijinks preceded by something like four hours of romping; globe trotting; intermittent Nazi-thwarting period-set archaeological causality, but Spielberg doesn't just tread ground: he offers fresh character dynamics; addresses some rather personal issues that affect those caught up in the film's adventure and does his utmost to include action sequences that are every bit as exciting as what preceded them without ever necessarily mirroring them. Where other franchises have in the past faltered through repetition by this stage, Spielberg's film offers fresh wit and flair towards what is essentially the same theme park ride gone again.",

49,28 February 2022,habeebthemightybird,9," A perfect ""end"" to a classic saga",What can I say? Another classic Spielberg movie. Sean Connery and Harrison Ford's chemistry is very fun and the entire movie is a blast from start to finish. The movie gives fantastic depth to Indie's life and gives an action packed movie and a brilliant narrative at the same time. It is nothing short of genius how the action of the movie actually contributes to the plot. The parallels between Indie and his father are fantastic and Elsa's story is just brilliant. A collection of different people with different values but all with one goal: to find the Holy Grail. This film is nothing short of fantastic and should be remembered as a classic.,
50,29 September 2007,ackstasis,10," ""The quest for the Grail is not archeology; it's a race against evil.""","In 1981, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg astonished the cinema-going world with the brilliant rip-roaring adventure of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' featuring Harrison Ford as the rugged, handsome, whip-cracking archaeologist Indiana Jones. A phenomenal critical and box-office success, the film inevitably resulted in the production of sequels, which, happily, did not diminish greatly in quality. 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' was released in 1986, to a rather more mixed reception, but the noticeably darker overtones and awe-inspiring effects-driven action sequences nonetheless make it one of cinema's supreme adventures. The third film in the series, 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' was released in 1989, partially as Spielberg's ""atonement"" for the perceived faults in his previous instalment.",
51,17 August 2010,Geeky Randy,10, The peak of the series!,"Indiana Jones is back for a third round, battling the Nazis again while tracking down his father (Connery) who suddenly went missing while searching for the Holy Grail. Ford, Elliot and Rhys-Davies all reprise their roles from ""Raiders"", but this time their performances seem to have better chemistry with each other. Sean Connery nearly steals the show as the arrogant and gruff Professor Henry Jones, Sr. Doody makes a better love interest and has more to do with the story than just the token girl that Allen and Capshaw unfortunately got stuck with. From the opening scene with Phoenix portraying a young Indiana Jones, to the climax at the Canyon of the Crescent Moon, this is easily marked as the peak of the series. Absolutely stunning.",
52,2 April 2003,Agent10,8, A great second fiddle,"Sure, Raiders of the Lost Ark is far better, this film is still pretty darn good in its own respects. Few films that are considered second best in a series could be considered better than most films that are released on its own. But when one watches this film, the action is comparable to Lost Ark. What I especially found interesting was the three obstacles to the Last Crusade, which was amazing, especially the invisible bridge. I've always thought the pairing of Connery and Ford was absolute genius. Someone should have been given a reward for that great casting choice. I can't wait for this one to come out on DVD.",
53,18 December 2009,diac228,10," Top-notch adventure masterpiece, The Last Crusade raises the bar and remains one of the best films you'll ever see.","Of all the franchises in the history of film-making, not a single one boasts a better third film than The Last Crusade. Of all the sequels in this Earth, very few can quite measure up to The Last Crusade. This film set and raised the bar for all adventures following it—a bar that not a single film has yet reached. Indiana Jones becomes a movie legend with the third installment. This movie has it all: action, comedy, adventure, mystery, horror, romance, and a perfect way to end a nearly-flawless trilogy. The Last Crusade is not only an amazing sequel, but ranks in my list as one of the greatest films of all-time. Without exaggeration, this movie fires on all cylinders, hits all the targets without question, and quite frankly certifies Steven Spielberg as easily one of the greatest directors in the last quarter century.",

And that's just what they deliver.","Before even the days of ""Raiders Of The Ark"", Spielberg had expressed an interest in making a James Bond movie but he couldn't get the go-ahead from Bond producer Albert ""Cubby"" Broccoli. Indy was just as good an opportunity for him, though, and who better to cast as Indy's father than (the original) James Bond himself? It's actually through the casting choice of Sean Connery that this third instalment of Indy's adventures really takes flight and silences the critics of ""The Temple Of Doom"". In his third outing, Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) goes in search of his father, Prof. Henry Jones Sr (Sean Connery) who mysteriously disappeared while searching for the Holy Grail. Once again, though, the Nazi's are also in tow. After losing on the Ark of the Covenant, they too want to get their hands on the Cup of Christ. By the time of this films release everybody was fully aware of Indiana Jones. With only two films under his fedora, every woman wanted him and every man wanted to be him; Indy had already become an icon of American cinema. With a fond familiarity, people welcomed him into their homes and that's the very reason why the opening of this third instalment is such a joy. It's depiction of Indy in his youth is wonderful addition to his backstory and the late great River Phoenix does an excellent job in capturing Ford's mannerisms. We learn of his use of the whip and the resulting scar on his chin. We also get an insight into the procurement of his famous fedora and how his unusual name of ""Indiana"" originated from the family dog... (It was actually George Lucas' dog that was named Indiana and it also served as the inspiration for Chewbacca in ""Star Wars""). After being heavily criticised for his dark tone in ""Temple of Doom"", Spielberg finds his lighter side again and delivers the funniest and most gleefully entertaining of Indy's adventures. The likes of Denholm Elliott and John Rhys Davies return from Raiders with more fleshed out comical roles but, as mentioned, it's the great interplay between Ford and Connery that's the biggest draw to here. The chemistry between them anchors a poignant family adventure while providing numerous father/son comedic moments. Like the previous two, though, there's no shortest of nail-biting action as World War II is on the brink and the Nazi's are once again Indy's foes and gives Spielberg another chance to put the Third Reich to the test. ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" are obviously his more personal films on the subject but with Indy he gets the chance to have fun with them again, leaving this third instalment with more in common with ""Raiders"" as well as honing in on the biblical aspects of the story. Out goes the Ark and in comes the coveted Holy Grail and while the fourth film in the franchise - ""The Kingdom Of The Crystal"" - explores a misjudged science-fiction element, it confirms that Indy's adventures are better left in the paths of the religious or the occult.",

And for good reason! This is a wonderful, and delightful film, with tons of amazing performances and an engaging story. Indiana Jones is one of the greatest characters of all time, and I feel like this film shows some of his many layers, as well as going into his past. I think Indy's father is one of Sean Connery's best performances, and you can really tell that he's having a blast in this movie. Marcus Brody is fun to see in a bigger role, and Sallah is always great to see. Donovan is a good villain, and Elsa is one of my favorite characters in the franchise. She's so layered, and her costumes are a highlight. Plus, I feel like she's a good foil for our protagonists. I think this film has some great shot compositions, and I think this is the most intricately plotted story of the franchise... Plus, I think the twists do well on the first watch. I think this film has some of the best action of the franchise, and the humor here is so good... I think every joke here lands. My only nitpick is that some of the sequences drag on for just a little too long... But I enjoy this film enough that it also has a ton of fun things and is fun to re-watch...

I just feel so close and immersed into this world, a bit because I used to be a part of it (used to study archeology) but mainly because Spielberg gives it that touch of magic, fun and pure, meaningful entertainment, representing the true essence of what cinema should be. I loved this from start to finish. I liked the little flashback with young Indy (what a performance by River). The movie follows the exact same structure of the last two, and this may possibly be a flaw for some watchers, since it would make the movie ""predictable"" or make less entertaining the cinematic experience, but none of it happened with me, I mean it didn't happen for a lot of people; this shows how freaking good Spielberg is at his job - I dare you to name me a trilogy or a cinematic saga that does the same and doesn't flop. Then the movie turns into a western and I was all over the place. Man I can't describe how fun I had during the watch, and toward the end we find ourselves face-to-face with an important section of the movie that stimulates us to reflect on our lives (also aided by the great and deep relationship between Indy and his father - Connery was so likeable - and by some great pieces of dialogue that I'll probably dream in my sleep tonight).",

The opening, however, is just the start of a fantastic journey that involves Nazi's, a dogfight with fighter planes, and a well done journey into the lair of the Holy Grail. The screenplay, written by Jeffrey Boam, is terrific. It has the right amount of comedy one-liners and adventure to hold your attention for 2 hours. I have to comment on this character of Indiana Jones again. Harrison Ford plays this character so perfectly that he almost made me forget Han Solo and George Lucas has created one of the most memorable characters in the modern cinema.

Now for me this film didn't do it better than the first one but it was a definite improvement over the not as good Temple of Doom. It bought back the action adventure elements that were missing in Temple of Doom and made this so fun and entertaining to watch. Along with the classic action sequences there was still plenty of room for the comedy that you expect in the series and it delivered a lot more that the previous film, as the first one did. Plot wise, it took an approach more similar to that of Raiders of the Lost Arc, which i found to be a very interesting and engaging plot.

The characters and story are engaging, the movie is directed and written almost perfectly and overall, the movie is very comedic in its tone but also serious, with two such opposing tones mixing together perfectly! There are so many amazing sequences that clearly demonstrate just how amazing the art of film making was back in the glory days.

And Jones is also bringing along his father, Professor Henry Jones (Sean Connery). Like its predecessor, the film's strength lies in its action sequences and charm, but there's also a much stronger emphasis on characterization, provided largely by the great interactions between co-stars Harrison Ford and Sean Connery. Spielberg's movies have always had a theme on the shaky relationships between fathers and their children, and this film plays on the strained relationship between Indiana Jones and his cantankerous father Henry Sr. It's a great dynamic that fuels the best and most impressive action sequences during ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.""",

While I personally have mixed feelings about Temple of Doom, I will always remember it as the stepping stone to this third entry, which in my view, redeems any wrongdoings committed by the second. A big complaint about the second movie was that there were no nazis in it, and thus having Indy fight against insane cultists basically ruined the tension. The third reich is back in The Last Crusade, and this time, they won't be beaten so easily. As usual, Harrison Ford reprises his character from the first two movies, but Last Crusade also introduces his father, Henry Jones Sr, played by Sean Connery. He's a very important part to the story because his diary serves as a blueprint for Indy's adventure. The movie begins in 1912, and Indiana Jones is only a teenager. As of right now, he's taking part in an expedition to a cave in Utah, where he discovers some grave robbers attempting to steal a 16th century crucifix studded with solid gold and gemstones. After securing it, he is chased by the men and forced to clamber onto a train carrying a bunch of circus related items. Here, he acquires a whip and learns how to use it for the first time. Eventually, Indy makes it back to his dad's house and wants his father to look at the valuable item he has, but he's not interested. A gang of men accompanied by cops ride up to the house and Indy is forced to surrender his treasure to them. Over 20 years later, Jones fights this same gang on a ship in stormy waters off the coast of Portugal and manages to sink the ship, killing all onboard. Some time after, Jones meets with a rich socialite named Walter Donovan, who is secretly a nazi. He tells Jones how he wants him to travel to Venice in order to meet someone named ""Schneider"", who is able to point him in the direction of the exact grail Jesus drank from during the last supper. Upon reaching Italy, it's revealed (Elsa) Schneider is a woman. Jones and her access some hidden passageways under a library (that used to be a church) and eventually come across a coffin. Inside, they discover a shield which has a complete version of the crucifix pattern Indy's father drew in his diary. Unfortunately, some assassins have realized what's going on and attempt to burn Indy and Elsa out of the catacombs with torches. They manage to escape in motorboats, and Jones gives his father's diary to a turkish friend of his to keep it out of nazi hands. Soon, he arrives at the austrian-german border. Here, a large castle with a gaggle of nazis inside is apparently the hiding place of Henry Jones Sr. After Indy is reunited with his father, an SS colonel named Vogel holds Elsa at gunpoint and demands Jones to surrender or else he will kill his friend. He puts down his weapons, only to learn it was a trap. Elsa is actually a nazi. In the lower level of the castle, Jones and his father are brought before none other than Donovan, who is best friends with the third reich now. Being faced with another difficult situation, the Jones' are tied to chairs, and Elsa leaves with Donovan. Indy attempts to burn through the rope holding him in place using a cigarette lighter, but drops it and the room goes up in flames. They manage to escape with little time to spare, and are able to commandeer a german motorcycle. After an intense chase, Jones travels to Berlin itself in order to get his father's diary back from Elsa. He's clearly upset with her, but can't kill her in the company of so many of her fellow nazis. Jones even comes face to face with Hitler, who signs his father's diary without knowing what it actually is. Jones and his father then hitch a ride on a zeppelin and attempt to flee the country, but Vogel learns of their presence and alerts everyone. This means Jones has to escape in a biplane slung underneath the blimp's dorsal structure, with his father manning the machine gun in the backseat. Unsurprisingly, Jones crashes the plane but the two manage to elude the germans again. The scenery then undergoes a change, and we're suddenly in Turkey, where the local sultan has employed the nazis to find the Holy Grail for him. Colonel Vogel leads a large convoy of supply trucks in his personal tank, and his flanks are heavily guarded. Despite Jones Sr. Being taken hostage inside the vehicle, Indy climbs onto the tank and engages Vogel in a fistfight, distracting him long enough to have the tank fall off the side of a cliff. Finally, the home stretch of the film takes place in a temple located in a valley. Donovan, Elsa, and the rest of the nazis are here, and they are trying to steal the Grail. The way to it is laden with traps, and Donovan shoots Indy's father so that Indy has to venture in and find the grail himself. After overcoming things such as buzzsaws, bottomless pits, and false jumps that lead to nowhere, Indy arrives in a large room being guarded by a single knight, who has been kept alive for the last 700 years because of the grail's powers. Little does Indy know, Elsa and Donovan have followed him in. Donovan chooses the wrong grail to drink from, which results in him dying a horrible and violent death as all his skin decomposes extremely quickly. Indy chooses a humbler looking grail (one that has no gold on it) and says it looks more befitting of a humble person like Jesus. He has made the right decision. Indy isn't killed upon drinking from it, and his father is healed when he lets him use it. As for Elsa, she tries to leave with the grail and falls to her death after triggering an earthquake. Indy almost takes it with him, but his father says not to. I have to say, after the somewhat disappointing second entry in the series, I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this movie. What I got though was simply a vast improvement on its predecessor. One of my biggest complaints about Temple of Doom was how obnoxious the side characters were. Willie was the typical damsel in distress that didn't do much other than stand around and yell whenever she got into trouble. Elsa is a much more tolerable character, and is clearly more intelligent. No irritating small kid sidekick following Indy this time either (thank god). The movie is also a winner for me because it has such a huge variety of locations compared to the previous film. It features deserts, coastal towns, mountainous areas, beaches, and temples. Connery was great too. It does get kind of annoying seeing Harrision Ford constantly yell at his ""father"" because he often falls behind in the chase scenes, but that's solely on Ford's part. The action scenes themselves in this film were also way better than Temple of Doom. The scene where Indy fights Vogel on top of the tank is still spectacular. This time, I just cared more about what was happening. Overall, many might disagree with me on this, but I feel that Last Crusade is a much more impressive movie than not only the second Indy film, but the first one as well.",

105,15 March 2005,jboothmillard,10, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"The first film Raiders of the Lost Ark is critics' favourite, the second Temple of Doom went just a tiny bit off the rails, and this third instalment is my personal favourite, besides the original, from director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan). The first ten minutes see young Indiana (River Phoenix) having his first adventure to rescue an artefact, a cross, and getting his iconic chin scar and fedora felt hat. Then, 1938, grown up Indy (Harrison Ford) is on a ship fighting to get the cross (oh, it is meant to be three years after he found the Lost Ark). Then the real story begins, he meets artefact collector, Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), who shows him a tablet marker with details about the cup of Christ (that he used during the last supper), the Holy Grail, which if drunk from will give eternal life/immortality. Donovan tells him to pick up where the scientist expert left off in Venice, Italy, believed to be the location of the second tablet marker, oh, this expert is Indy's father! So, he meets his Dad's assistant, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), they find the second marker under the library in the sewers, and some cultists dedicated to stopping anyone finding the Grail are after them for a while. He reaches his Dad, Professor Henry Jones (the excellent BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Sir Sean Connery), and after escaping the Nazi Germans (yes, their back) they are on the run trying to get to the resting place of the Grail first. Old friends Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) also join them along the journey. Also starring Michael Byrne as Vogel, Kevork Malikyan as Kazim, Robert Eddison as Grail Knight, Richard Young as Fedora, Alexei Sayle as Sultan and Indy even comes face to face with Adolf Hitler (Michael Sheard). I should mention that Indiana's real name is Henry, that's why his Dad insists on calling him 'Junior' (George Lucas as writer named the character after his dog, Indiana, just like in the film). It won the Oscar for Best Sound Effects Editing, and it was nominated for Best Music for John Williams and Best Sound, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Sound and Best Special Effects. Steven Spielberg was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, River Phoenix was number 69, Sir Sean Connery number 8, and Harrison Ford number 5 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Connery was also number 3 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and Indiana Jones was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains.

After two exciting adventures, it was time to explore the character even more. It was an opportunity to build on his character development. Also, the series hit a stumbling block, when the second film failed to capture the greatness and magic of the first film. The producers had to jack things up, for what was essentially a comeback film. Paramount signed River Phoenix to be a young Indiana Jones. The prologue to this film goes back to 1912 and tells the story about how the teenager became the man. By doing this, a huge star had to be cast into the role of Indy's father. Who better, than the original James Bond himself, Sean Connery, as Professor Henry Jones.

Indiana Jones teams up with his father to find the Holy Grail before the Nazis, and Indiana falls in love with a woman who is a spy for the enemy. The moments between Indiana and his father are emotional, and I would say that this film goes much more into depth about Indiana and his character than the other films do. As always, there are a lot of creative action sequences which will leave you on the edge of your seat. It is a fairly long film, but it's not a dull one, and it's got plenty of different types of action and chase scenes to maintain interest throughout. You won't be disappointed.

This casting was largely due to James Bond being one of the inspirations for Indiana Jones although oddly enough despite my love of Indiana Jones I've never been keen on the James Bond films. There's something about father-son stories that I've always had a particular affection for and the relationship between Indy and his father is challenging to put into words how thematically in-depth it is.

Temple of Doom is disappointing at best (although there are some great comedic moments - it just isn't in line with the other two films). The best, in my opinion, is Last Crusade. It isn't just that Harrison Ford and Sean Connery have such excellent on-screen chemistry as father and son. Or that the comedy bits are so fun. Nor the brilliant ending... No - what makes it so fantastic is that no film made since has even come close to being as good as this film in any respect. It is the pinnacle of ""scholarly"" action-adventure films.

The dark theme from ""Raiders"" is back, but is sadly not heard often. 2. Excellent performance by River Phoenix as the young Indiana Jones. He was truly believable and I was sad that he was not given more screen time as the early part of the movie was really captivating. When he spots the golden cross and tells his friend to go get the professor his eyes look exactly like Ford's. 3.

Great chemistry between Ford and Connery. Great special effects, cinematography. It's as well made as the rest of the trilogy. I think this film is my least favorite of the originals but that's honestly just because I feel like it's a little too similar to the first film, I would have liked to see them go somewhere even weirder than the second movie, and that's part of the reason why I respect the second film over this one.

Aside from that, this also features one of my favorite sites in the whole Middle East. Just watch and see what I mean. For me, this is one of the better father-son movies. Sure they fight a lot but what parent-child duo doesn't? Maybe they should play this movie more on Father's Day. That would prove that not all father-son relationships are as bad as they seem. As for me, this is my favorite Indiana Jones movie. A lot of the actors from Star Wars are in here, including Julian Glover (who played General Veers), Harrison Ford (Han Solo!), and the late Michael Sheard (who played the first guy Darth Vader strangled in The Empire Strikes Back).

What made this one fun to watch was great action and great interplay between Connery and Harrison Ford.  Sean Connery really added a spark to this one and provided the film with some of its more humorous elements (Still like Raiders best though).  This one has Indiana looking for the Holy Grail...the villains, once again it is the Nazis.  This one starts out with kind of an earlier Jones adventure with the late River Phoenix as the young Indiana Jones taking an artifact from this tomb raiders cause as Indy says, ""it belongs in a museum"".  Then the story flash forwards to him trying to recover the same artifact.  Then he goes after the Holy Grail because his father has disappeared while looking for it.  This leads Indy to Venice then to a castle in, I think, Austria where he finds his dad a prisoner of the Nazis. After they get away they have to go into the heart of Germany to retrieve a book that will help them get through traps that protect the Holy Grail. They take a zephyr and there is a cool bi-plane fight and then it is off to a Middle Eastern country to find the grail.  The trap scenes are cool and there is a great tank scene before the traps.  Then comes the only complaint I have and that is the chamber with the Holy Grail...the guy guarding it was a bit lame.  Other than that though, this was a really great movie.",

The character of Indiana Jones is further developed in this movie. Sean Connery and Harrison Ford work wonderful as ""father and son"". This idea of ""father and son"" adds humor to the wonderful story. What makes this entry slightly different then the two previous films is that Indy is not only searching for the Holy Grail but he is also searching for a antiquity that is more rare then the Holy Grail or any of the artifacts he was searching for in the predecessors, Indy is searching for his father. The music is good. The acting is great especially Sean Connery's performance as Dr. Henry Jones. Do yourself a favor and watch this classic.",
141,19 June 2017,stormhawk2021,9, Another sequel for a great Adventure trilogy,"Before even the days of ""Raiders Of The Ark"", Spielberg had expressed an interest in making a James Bond movie but he couldn't get the go-ahead from Bond producer Albert ""Cubby"" Broccoli. Indy was just as good an opportunity for him, though, and who better to cast as Indy's father than (the original) James Bond himself? It's actually through the casting choice of Sean Connery that this third installment of Indy's adventures really takes flight and silences the critics of ""The Temple Of Doom"". In his third outing, Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) goes in search of his father, Prof. Henry Jones Sr (Sean Connery) who mysteriously disappeared while searching for the Holy Grail. Once again, though, the Nazi's are also in tow. After losing on the Ark of the Covenant, they too want to get their hands on the Cup of Christ. By the time of this films release everybody was fully aware of Indiana Jones. With only two films under his fedora, every woman wanted him and every man wanted to be him; Indy had already become an icon of American cinema. With a fond familiarity, people welcomed him into their homes and that's the very reason why the opening of this third installment is such a joy. It's depiction of Indy in his youth is wonderful addition to his backstory and the late great River Phoenix does an excellent job in capturing Ford's mannerisms. We learn of his use of the whip and the resulting scar on his chin. We also get an insight into the procurement of his famous fedora and how his unusual name of ""Indiana"" originated from the family dog... (It was actually George Lucas' dog that was named Indiana and it also served as the inspiration for Chewbacca in ""Star Wars""). After being heavily criticized for his dark tone in ""Temple of Doom"", Spielberg finds his lighter side again and delivers the funniest and most gleefully entertaining of Indy's adventures. The likes of Denholm Elliott and John Rhys Davies return from Raiders with more fleshed out comical roles but, as mentioned, it's the great interplay between Ford and Connery that's the biggest draw to here. The chemistry between them anchors a poignant family adventure while providing numerous father/son comedic moments. Like the previous two, though, there's no shortest of nail-biting action as World War II is on the brink and the Nazi's are once again Indy's foes and gives Spielberg another chance to put the Third Reich to the test. ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" are obviously his more personal films on the subject but with Indy he gets the chance to have fun with them again, leaving this third installment with more in common with ""Raiders"" as well as honing in on the biblical aspects of the story.

As the same with the other Indiana Jones movies this one follows the same format. Indiana with a sidekick and woman in tow goes to find an archaeological treasure of importance. The difference between this movie and the others is that this time there is a father-son aspect that was not present in the others and this was a brilliant move on part of the producers and director Steven Spielberg. It really added something new that was not there before and it added new possibilities for humor which they cashed in on with great reward. Again this was a fantastic movie and people should see it.

This is actually as much to do with how Steven Spielberg and George Lucas craft the story, villains (including sexy femme fatale), and the action set pieces as it does with the casting of Sean Connery as Harrison Ford's father. ",
157,16 September 2009,Dr_Coulardeau,9, Back to perfection,"Spielberg was well inspired again and anew after the badly thought second episode and he brought his Indiana Jones back to the Nazi time and context. It's clear and some of the scenes, including the meeting with Adolf Hitler himself are sickeningly obnoxious and hilariously crystal clear: Hitler is evil, he burns books, he kills people, he enjoys it and he is surrounded by the scum of humanity. But Spielberg goes one iota further and introduces his version of the American Nazi and this one is worse than Adolf Hitler himself, he has no historical ambition or vision just plain personal and self centered egotistic interest. He is a Nazi out of pure opportunism and that is even worse evil than Nazism itself. But Spielberg gets to another dimension too by introducing Indiana Jones's father and Sean Connery does quite a credible father of that crazy adventurer, or should I say adventuring archaeology professor. But one improvement is never enough for our Spielberg and this time the main woman is an evil traitor, a Nazi that prefers dying to letting the prey of her hunt go, even when it is obviously too late and out of reach. And that prey is the Holy Grail, mind you. This time the myth is a good western myth, Christian what's more. And this myth needs a delicate treatment but has immense possibilities for us and these possibilities are used right to the end. So we discover the underground catacombs of Venice and their rats, a good old chase on a train transporting a circus and all its animals, a sacred temple in Jordan and all kinds of religious symbols and traps, and the winners are those who believe in and respect these symbols, and that has to be Indiana Jones and his father. Too bad for all the others: the treasure hunter who takes the most beautiful and golden chalice and dies on the spot after drinking from it, the greedy woman who disappears in the depth of the earth, and all the other bad guys and bad boys. Some scene are superb like the crazy German tank in the desert. Every detail is hilarious and suspenseful and even a second viewing, or probably even more, is as effective as the first one. Very well inspired indeed this time, this famous Spielberg, but since he made Dr Jones Senior drink the water of eternal life in the Holy Grail itself, he is doomed to go on and on with that legend. The fourth episode has already been produced and Harrison Ford has just announced a few days ago he was ready to get into the adventure of a fifth episode, now he has been provided with a son in this fourth episode: he has to guide the new Junior into the next stage of the quest.",

The action is great and I've seen this many times. I loved every scene in this film including the chase scenes. I even liked the part when Donovan drinks the wrong grail and turning into a skeleton. It was almost like Donovan turning into a zombie. The final boss was Donovan's skeleton in Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures and I played the game many times. The special effects of Donovan decaying and turning into the skeleton was great. The part that I liked was when Indy pushes Donovan's skeleton into the wall and it crumbles into pieces.

Jones searches for the Holy Grail as instructed in his father's diary. Eventually he rescues his father who was a prisoner to the Nazis who also search for the Grail. This leads to exhilarating action sequences involving blimps, airplanes and tanks. The production is top notch and director Steven Spielberg does a fantastic job but Raiders of the Lost Ark remains the best of the series. Harrison Ford has the role of Jones down to a tee. Sean Connery as Senior Jones often takes the humour into overplay, which hinders much of his scenes despite the character as a terrific role. River Phoenix appears as young Jones presents a great opening where he narrowly escapes death but discovers his calling. Alison Doody is the villainess who plays Jones through and through until her aim for possessions becomes more important than her own life. The role is as bland as cardboard. John Rhys Davies makes an appearance from the superior Raiders of the Lost Ark. Light hearted with a father son theme to underline it all but the point is clearly that of entertainment and on that note the film works wonderfully, with a little comic intrusion for good measure. Score: 6 / 10",

I really think Sean Connery made this movie better with comedic sparring with Indiana. Although the plot was similar to the previous 2, I think that the dialogue and comedy aspect just made this movie much more enjoyable for this trilogy.

He and Harrison Ford made a great match-up. And I also think Harrison Ford did better in this than any of the others. I also loved Elsa Schneider, I just wish she wasn't a Nazi. But she's the hottest woman out of the lead women in the Indiana Jones series. But I wish I could've seen more of her and I think her performance is pretty underrated.

Sean Connery is great as Henry Jones, and he's hialrious too.  True, there is a lot of humour in this film, which can sometimes detract from the excitement, but the overall effect is fun and thrills.  Though not as impressively executed as Raiders, with some effects that are actually worse, the film is still a perfect demonstration of Spielberg's direction (e.g. the shadow turning on the blimp signalling to Indy that the blimp is heading back for Germany ).

The addition of Sean Connery is also brilliant and adds a personal element that felt lacking in the previous two Indy film (not that they needed it because they're also kinda perfect). The twist villain is fantastic, the treasure hunt feels the most ""treasure-hunty"" of all the Indy movies yet it never loses the Indiana Jones magic mainly due to the fact that Harrison Ford owns the character so much that the man has become synonymous with Indy.

193,14 August 2002,ColeSear,10, The best of the Series (Spoilers),"'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' is better than the original for many reasons. It's a film that doesn't just hit you but involves you more in the story line. Part of why it is easier to go along for that ride is because you've been prepared by the previous film to expect certain things despite this there are also some new and creative elements in this movie which separates it. 	In the beginning we get what is seemingly an unattached scene. In this one we flash back to when Indiana was a child, played by River Phoenix. His chase for a crucifix establishes a few things. First, it establishes that this will be yet another religious relic that they will be in search of. Second, and more importantly it defines who his arch enemy is. We also get glimpses into the character's psyche whereas previously he was a very external being we get this just through seeing past events. Young Indiana picks up a whip for the first time when coming face to face with a lion. Then we see the interplay between him and his father and can see how the boy doesn't understand how his father could've dedicated his whole life to these adventures especially in his mother's absence. 	When Indiana is pegged for a mission the discussion of it is much more confrontational than in the first. There is a lot more give and take. Indy shows part of his disbelief in the grail while we are told the history in much more detail than we were in the first film when Indy was in search of the Ark of the Covenant. He's very reluctant to go but is urged on by the fact that his father has been kidnapped this after him mysteriously receiving his father's Grail Diary. 	This film is full of riddles and mind games which makes it that much more entertaining. He arrives in the library that was a converted church and with Ilsa Schneider () they have to solve a puzzle of where the catacombs are. They look for the Roman numerals but can't find one. Indy on a hunch runs up the stairs and sees the X all across the floor. Down in the dark with all the rats Spielberg reaches a moment of terror with all the rats crawling along. 	Another great touch this film had was in keeping with the traditions of the 40s and 50s in that we could never quite figure anyone out. I was genuinely surprised by Ilsa both when we were shown she was a Nazi and then later when she mislead her leader in the choosing which grail was the Holy Grail. That coupled with her femme fatale status of seducing men only to ruin them made her seem like something out of a film noir. 	The tandem of Sean Connery and Harrison Ford worked very well together. Their timing is great especially when they were both tied up and were trying to talk to one another face to face and their heads kept swiveling side to side. Their relationship dominated significant portions of the film and they exchanged great moves and funny lines constantly. On the zeppelin the ball was in Junior's court and stayed their as they escaped but in the plane Senior had to shoot the machine gun and shot the tail off and was hysterical in denying it. Then on the beach he got the seagulls flapping to knock down the second plane. 	What I also found quite interesting in both this film and the first although it was more prominent in this film was the involvement and use of the Nazis. It was interesting for me because I had believed Spielberg had never addressed any aspect of the war in any sort of way until making 'Schindler's List.' Having established the Nazi interest in the occult and in conquering religion I think that's why there was more Nazi involvement here. It also allowed for a hilarious scene where Ford dressed as a Nazi who comes face to face with Adolf Hitler who instead of burning the grail diaries signs it for him and moves on from there. 	For me the only stumbling blocks to make this a completely fulfilling experience cam towards the end. When Indiana must spell out the name of God, Jehovah was not the name that immediately came to mind it was, in fact, Yahweh which was the original Hebrew word which people did not speak and when it was written there were no vowels. However, it was later replaced by Jehovah. This is no fault on the filmmakers part its just a slight technicality that some may or may not pick up on. 	This time, however, I was prepared for what would happen to the man who drank from the false grail because it was foreshadowed and also because it closely resembled the end of the first film. My one question lay in the fact that it seemed to me from the way the situation was explained that Indiana would now be immortalized and would have to guard the grail or his father would maybe perhaps they escape that by trying to remove the grail it did get a little hazy in that regard but nonetheless it was quite an enjoyable film that blended many diverse elements to make for a really entertaining ride.",

Indiana Jones is definitely Harrison Ford's best career role on the line with Rick Deckard.",
196,9 December 2015,Filvies144,9," Great movie, my favorite of the franchise","That's right, folks! It is slightly better than the amazing film, Raiders of the lost ark! Its also an improvement from Temple of doom as well. But here's why its so great In this, the prologue takes place with young Indy's adventure in 1912, which is fun and interesting to see Indy as a boy scout escaping from gangsters. The rest of the movie takes place 2 years after Raiders in 1938, where Indy must hunt for the holy grail before the Nazis and find his missing father. OK, I admit that it is like Raiders, but I am totally fine with it because Raiders is an amazing film, and this is a well executed film that is linked with it. Unlike Temple of doom, its a sequel that actually follows raiders and has Marcus Brody, Sallah, and Nazis, making this related to Raiders. But the only problem is that there were some plot holes in the 3rd act (I won't spoil it). But other than that, its much more pleasant and great than seeing monkey brains being eaten and children being enslaved, and having an annoying love interest like in Temple of doom.",

201,28 December 1999,baumer,10, The greatest third installment of a series ever,"Thanks to the Godfather and Rocky movies, sequels became a part of our vernacular in the 70's.  If there was a sequel before these two franchises, I can't remember them.  And since sequels have meant pretty much big bucks at the box office, many times they are pale imitations to the original.   To name a few movie franchises that have now gone on to do at least three films, you have the Rocky's, Godfather, Halloween, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Aliens, Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Jaws, Star Wars, Batman, Rambo, Superman, Scream, Child's Play, Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  These are just a few of the film franchises that have gone on to do at least three films.  And I can guarantee you that no film series can boast that their third offering is almost as good as their first.  It just doesn't happen.  It is hard to duplicate the energy and originality of the first one that came out.  But the Indy movies are different.  First of all they are created by two of the best in the business and they star one of the greatest actors to ever live.  And what you get when you have two creative genius behind the scenes is a series that tries so hard to please and a series that doesn't rehash the story that made the first one work.  You get a story that furthers the trials and tribulations of the hero Indiana Jones, and you get a film that keeps giving you insights into his life.  In the first, we meet Indiana Jones, the daring archeologist that risks life and limb to recover artifacts for his museum.  You also meet Marion Ravenwood, a long lost love, Marcus Brody, his mentor and boss and Sola, one of best friends from Cairo and Belloq ( or according to Sola, Bellosh ).  Temple of Doom takes us back in time and introduces us to Short Round. And finally we have Last Crusade.  Here we meet Indiana Jones as a teenager.  We are introduced to the folklore that is Indiana Jones.  We see how his fear of snakes started, how he was introduced to his bullwhip and his fedora and even how he got that famous scar on his chin.  And in the casting coup of the century, we meet his dad played by Sean Connery.  We are also treated to some familiar faces as Brody and Sola return.  Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the best second sequel ever made.  This could have been the beginning to a series if we didn't already know about Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It is that much fun and so filled with richness.",

The cast are terrific, and in a way, Harrison Ford is the odd one out, as he is surrounded by many British actors. There is a grandiose feeling about it, and the music amplifies this feeling.

Well in many respects this picture is a retread of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" with it's serial style one danger after another to escape from. What makes it work I think is the father/son camaraderie of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery who play off each other effectively, and in many cases without saying a word. Like the 'she talks in her sleep' scene that floors Indy, that was just a hoot. And the old 'pen is mightier than the sword' gimmick takes on new meaning when the senior Jones finds himself in a tough spot. With all the location changes, character names and snakes and rats to distract you, the action is sometimes a little difficult to follow, but this is pretty much what you want your action adventures to look like.

Walter Donovan, a wealthy collector of antiquities, approaches Indy saying that he has a lead to the location of the Holy Grail, the cup Christ drank from at the last supper which some believe have the power to grant immortality to those who drink from it. Indy is initially reluctant but then he is told that another archaeologist Donovan employed has gone missing Indy's father. The first lead takes him to Venice where he meets Dr Elsa Schneider, an Austrian archaeologist. Together they find further clues that, when combined with information that Indy's father had written in his dairy, will show the Grail's location. The adventure is far from over though; before they get to the site Indy will have to rescue his father from his Nazi captors, escape in a zeppelin.

217,15 July 2008,silverscreen888,8," unusual fun, an intelligent and satisfying thriller; visually fine","""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" to me seemed to be everything ""The Raiders of the Lost Ark"" had not been; I found it to be fun, a convincing action film, absorbing, well-acted and nicely photographed. John Wilims' majestic music was a great asset, while the screenplay by Jeffrey Boam and the storyline by George Lucas and Mennno Meyjes based on Lucas's and Philp Kaufmann's original characters was well-constructed and psychologically interesting. Steven Spielberg directed with a good eye for style and lighting as well as action sequences. Douglas Slocombe deserves credit for lucid cinematography, as do Fred Hole and Stphen Scott for their art direction, Peter Howitt for his set decorations and all the designers involved for bringing a lost era to vivid life. Among the actors, Julian Glover as the villain, John Rhys Davies and Denholm Elliott as the hero's friends, and Sean Connery stood out from a good cast of minor villains and lesser characters. As the troubled heroine, Alison Doody was adequate and occasionally more. Harrison Ford's intelligent lead as Indiana Jones carried the film much of the time; he has a lot to do inn the busy film and did it very well both physically and vocally, in my opinion. In a less coherent presentation, the dangers, pursuers and contrived special-effects sequences could easily have become tedious; here they never were, I assert.

Yet Last Crusade is still an immensely enjoyable adventure picture, with Spielberg proving that he was still capable of a popcorn bonanza. Using the Raiders formula and moving away from the dark flourishes of Temple Of Doom, Last Crusade is actually the simplest film of the three, but still it manages, courtesy of a sparkling casting decision, to become the most entertaining of the original trilogy. Is it better than Raiders? Of course not, but it positively rips along with sparky dialogue and an agenda of cliffhanging suspense like the adventure films of yore. ",

222,1 July 2015,Riddler2,10, Indiana Jones and the Wonderfully Entertaining Last Crusade The Master of Film's most Hopeful and Entertaining Indiana Jones Film!,"After the unforgettable movie experiences of the Color Purple and Empire of the Sun The Master of Film was back for the 3rd Indiana Jones Adventure and this Time Indiana Jones is bringing his dad along for the ride too in this entertaining wild adventure full of chase sequences great comedic foreplay and a wonderful central theme What is more important Life or Treasure? I love all the Indiana Jones adventures but this one is my favourite because of the beautiful David Lean style direction at the beginning with Young Indiana Jones and the race on the speeding train as the music escalates and rides along with the train the speed of the music the exhilaration as the chase picks up speed and pace as the music keeps going and going like the train the Music is the train at the beginning 15 minutes just relentless speed and exhilaration it is so forceful and fast very fast speeding along as the film begins! John Williams's wonderful fast paced score is My favourite of the whole of the Indiana Jones Series I love them all but there are many reasons the score is the best, the themes are all different and unique and like all John's scores they all represent a theme a idea a melodic identification for each character place props story or ideas and themes like redemption or glory or the film's message or the comedy banter between Indy's dad And Indy himself! The film successfully intertwines themes or overwhelming ideas of spiritualism or glory and redemption with a sense of fun and adventure and the human spirit being lifted soaring across the sky like in Empire of the Sun but this is not a drama but still it retains those themes from Empire of the Sun but presents them differently with the fun and adventure of Indiana Jones and his dad flying across the sky or on their motorbike as they flee the Nazis and the music intertwines themes for the Nazis and Indy and his dad ridding off on their motorbike to a scherzo for motorbike and orchestra wonderfully named and composed by John Williams! Sean Connery is the big star name here as Indy's father but Harrison Ford still has a whale of a time playing back and forth with Sean Connery it is a joy when they are on screen together they have 2 musical melodic themes one is fun and adventurous and exciting the other is more poignant and is more associated with the father because the relationship in the film is not as relaxed as it was before in a way the theme for the father is a memory or a motif for Indy's past or childhood it is very very patriotic but not sentimental or syrupy in any way shape of form it is a melodic theme an idea a memory a visit to the past! The film's message what is more important Life or Treasure is more of a spiritual message a spiritual ritual if you will a rite of passage and is very dominant at the end of the film the last 25 minutes is so important because the relationship heals becomes stronger after a wounded fractured past the relationship is severely broken down they are very condescending of each other making wisecracks puns you get the idea but by the end the film makes a poignant statement on the importance on family over treasure as Indy asks his father What did you find dad? Me? Illumination! the Holy Grail has recaptured their relationship and their bond is stronger more developed more tighter and their friendship is more kindly and forgiving to one another as they ride off into the sunset for the last time or so it seems?

This could have been titled Abbott and Costello and the Holy Grail, with it's pathetic attempts at humour. Connery is about as convincing as Ford's father as Jessie Royce Landis was as Cary Grant's mother in North by Northwest. And strange though it may seem, in 1938 it was illegal to kill German soldiers in cold blood, which Indiana Jones does with reckless abandon, and without any official sanction (at least James Bond had a licence to kill).

236,25 May 2008,zetes,9, As good as the first two,"The Last Crusade is the Indiana Jones film I've seen least. In fact, I may be lying if I were to say I've seen it more than once all the way through before this viewing. Having watched all three of the original trilogy last week, I have to say, there isn't a great gap between them in quality. They're all three excellent movies with brilliant direction by Spielberg, and pitch-perfect action sequences, paced just so as not to overwhelm the viewer. The Last Crusade is the most comic of the three films, adding Sean Connery as Indy's father and pairing the two as a kind of Abbot and Costello team. It's shocking just how well it works  if I hadn't seen the movie and you told me Harrison Ford and Sean Connery would be the perfect comic duo, I'd have been more than a little dubious. Connery isn't known for his comic chops, but, if he didn't have them before, he definitely earned them here. I think, after James Bond (and I'd say unfortunately so), his Henry Jones Sr. will prove to be his most remembered performance. Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies both return from Raiders, and both are more comic characters this time around (Elliot in particular is hilarious; I think Sallah is kind of wasted in this one). Alison Doody plays Indy's double-crossing love interest. I had remembered her as being particularly forgettable, but this time around I thought she was quite good. I still have to wonder what happened to Karen Allen (which is kind of explained in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull), who was by far the best of the Indy girls, but Doody is good at what she does. River Phoenix appears in the brilliant opening sequence as young Indiana Jones. What a sad waste his death was.",

For a little while, the piece gives off a major sense of déjà vu, being structurally similar to the first film in its series to the point that it almost seems like the same script with different set-pieces. However, once Connery's Henry Jones Sr. comes into play, the picture takes on a life all of its own. It's remarkably funny, the banter between father and son driving most of its comedy as well as its character. It's also remarkably exciting, with large-scale but still personal action sequences peppered throughout the gleefully globetrotting adventure. In many ways, it feels like the true sequel to 'Raiders', leaving 'Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom (1984)' as the 'odd one out' in the franchise. In many ways, the movie seems like Spielberg is trying to atone for the criticism of that much darker picture (he has said himself that it was one of the reasons he made this third outing). Even though 'Temple' isn't quite as dark as everyone makes out, it certainly lacks the smile-inducing, adventure serial vibe of its peers. 'Crusade' feels like the true successor to 'Raiders', going back to a delightful, almost hammy tone. It thrives because of it. The filmmakers know what's most important, keeping things fun and fast-paced. They also imbue each and every action beat with oodles of character, something that the flick in general has an abundance of. Its core relationship is especially satisfying, a fairly nuanced and endearing take on the 'estranged father' trope. By the time it's over, you'll have laughed, you'll have cried, you'll have been on the edge of your seat and you'll still have a beaming smile on your face. The experience is highly enjoyable. In fact, it's almost perfect. 9/10",

Harrison Ford,(Prof. Henry Indiana Jones, Jr.,""What Lies Beneath""02 performs one of his greatest roles just like an Errol Flynn, shooting three people with one bullet. Indiana Jones also falls in love with a sexy Nazi gal, Allison Doody,(Dr. Elsa Schneider), ""View to a Kill""'85 and has a very torrid kissing scene that leads to much more!  Sean Connery, (Prof. Henry Jones, Sr.)""Entrapment""'99 also seems to have shared the same bed with Dr. Elsa Schneider, who really was after a diary.   All these people in the movie were seeking the religious cup that Jesus used at the Last Supper.  Indiana Jones Jr., learned that he had to have a heart that was humble and full of Faith and Kindness in his spiritual soul in order to find the actual Chalice.  This is a great BELIEVABLE FILM, because of the deep serious message it has to offer all viewers of the 21 Century!   Look for the deep message this film has for you!  Professor Henry Jones, Sr., was asked what he learned about the Chalice used by Jesus and he said,"" ILLUMINATION"" ! This is probably what the clergy was taking about and the great message this film has for everyone, in COMEDY, DRAMA AND A DEEP MORALE LESSON to take away from this fantastic film.",

""The Last Crusade"" played a bigger part during my childhood and as a child I just had more fun watching this one. It just had everything I enjoyed watching as a kid meshed into one film. I do appreciate ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" as an adult, but this one was movie magic for me. It's also the installment that really got me into the character Indiana Jones and I wanted to emulate him. I really liked the dynamics between the characters, especially with Indy and his father. Their interactions between them was humorous and yet heartfelt in all the right parts. As a matter of fact, they got the humor right this time around. It's placed in all the right parts without it feeling like it's forced. The twists and the set pieces was spot on. And it really did bring about that authenticity while still carrying on that torch of it being a fun adventure film. There is also a lot more going on in this film with most of the main cast playing a part when it comes to the core of the story. It really was a masterful send off to this franchise...Well until Spielberg decided to direct ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"".",

To give just one example, the name ""Iehovah"" (or ""Jehovah"") for God arose as a confusion in the Renaissance; Knights Templar would not have made this mistake because they predated it, and God would not have made this mistake because He doesn't get confused -- especially not about His own name! Now, such things may seem like mere pedantry to those unfamiliar with the history of the Grail myths and so forth, but the fact is that the real story of the Templars is much more fascinating than the weak plot of this movie, and decent pulp fantasy informed by the real story would have been just awesome. A waste of very fine actors and of wonderful special effects.",

In this third (and possibly final) installment in the Indiana Jones series, Jones (Ford) has been invited to an associates house to translate an ancient tablet. When he translates it, he finds that it is a key to finding the holy grail; that's when he learns that his father (Sean Connery) has already begun the search. Throughout his quest to find his father, and then the grail, Jones encounters unforgettable villains, evil Nazis, and lovable allies, and when you add in lots of adventure, great dialogue, and the bonding between Indie and his dad, you have one of the greatest adventure movies of all time.

269,30 May 2017,ironhorse_iv,9," If you going to see this movie, then you had chosen wisely. Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade is the holy grail of adventure movies.","While, 1981's 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' & 1984's 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom', were all-great movies on their own right. 1989's 'Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade' was indeed my favorite of all those films. It had everything. Great action, wonderful humor, amazing special effects, powerful message, and a beautiful climax ending. It was a nearly a perfect movie. Directed by Steven Spielberg once again, the film tells the story of Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), this time, teaming up with his father, Henry (Sean Connery) in order to protect the Holy Grail from the evils of Nazi Germany. Without spoiling the movie, too much, this film is without a few flaws. One of the biggest complains about this movie, is how much, this film copycat the plot of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', down to a tee. Not only does both films have Indy search for biblical artifact, but also has a rival archaeologist/businessman that sympathizer with the Nazis in order to achieve power. This time, it's Walter Donovan (Julian Glover). No matter what the similarities are, with this plot and the first movie. I just have to say, the story is a lot better than some of the ideas, that writers George Lucas, Jeffery Boam, and Menno Meyjes were originally thinking of, like Indiana Jones exploring an ""haunted mansion"". That doesn't sounds like a 1930's serial, pulp adventure novel at all! Also, thank God, Spielberg didn't use, producer, George Lucas original idea of having Jones, look for alien skulls. We wouldn't get that, mess, until years later, when 2008's 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' came out, disappointing audiences everywhere. That would be horrible plot to end the original trilogy. While, Lucas's other idea of having Indy look for the Monkey King sounds ridiculous on the surface. In truth, it could had been an interesting film, if made. Regardless, there were a lot of new things that this film has to offer its viewers, as well. One of the better parts of the film was the action opening with River Phoenix playing a young Indiana Jones, trying to escape from some grave robbers via a passing circus train. That was a lot of fun. It was also very well told, as so many Indiana Jones's trademarks, were explain in 10 minute. During the filming of that sequence, producer George Lucas saw the potential of a prequel series. He would soon develop and produce, 'The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles', an American television series that aired on ABC from March 4, 1992, to July 24, 1993. Another innovative thing that the film has to offer, is the father/son relationship between Henry Sr. & Indy. The way, they interact with each other, both with body language and dialogue was amusing to watch. Of course, Harrison Ford as Indy was amazing, but who knew that, Sean Connery could be so funny!? He was wonderful in this role. Even, returning actors like Denholm Elliott as Dr. Marcus Brody & John Rhys-Davies as Sallah were equally as great in their small roles as of the original. Sadly, not all sidekick roles in this movie was remarkable. I was kinda disappointed with Indiana Jones teaming up with Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody) in the first part of the film. For a character that supposed to be archaeologist, she seems more like a stereotypical dumb blonde bimbo who really doesn't helps him in any way. She's pretty much there to be the required love interest & damsel in distress. Another thing, I didn't like about Elsa, was the character's twist toward the middle. Without spoiling it, too much, all I have to say, it very obviously that she's not playing with the right team, here. You can clearly see that, a mile ahead in the beginning. I thought, the movie could had done, better to make the character's seem more, heroic than what we got in the film; so that, her betrayal would hold more weight & be more emotional; rather than predictable & generic. Talking about broad. Like the original film, the villains in this movie were portray as cartoony over the top pure evil, rather than complex individuals. While, I wouldn't say, this is a bad thing, seeing how the sheer presence of Michael Byrne as Nazi Officer Vogel was just as good as Gestapo agent Todt (Ronald Lacey) from the first movie. I do think, a little more character development could be needed to fill in, some of the huge plot-holes of this film, has, like why the Nazis would be looking for the grail, if they can't bring it back to Germany, due to the Great Seal. It would be, pretty hard for the Nazis to control the temple, seeing how it's in the Hatay State. They weren't even close to Turkey, by 1939. Even in the height of WWII, Germany was nowhere near close in invading Syria. In the end, it felt a bit confusing. Thank God, we got the music by composer, John Williams to distract us, from that large plot-hole. Once again, the soundtrack was beautiful to listen to. The cinematography by Douglas Slocombe at the many exotic locations was also breathtaking in visual standards. There were so many iconic well-shot memorable scenes that it make me, want to visit many of these real-life sites in Utah, Turkey, Jordan, Italy, Germany and Spain. Overall: This movie was absolute blast to watch. Still, watchable, even today. Highly recommended for anybody seeking the call to adventure. A must watch.",

274,30 June 2017,sol-,7, Keep Up with the Jonses,"Learning of a Nazi plot to steal the Holy Grail, archaeologist Indiana Jones sets out to stop them, a quest that leads to him working alongside his estranged father in this second sequel to 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. Sean Connery is well cast as Indy's father, with very natural banter between them and there are some great action sequences - most notably a fight on a wooden boat being crushed by a propeller. Nothing quite matches the riveting opening few scenes though in which River Phoenix plays Indy as a lad with bits and pieces that explain his fear of snakes, love of whips and iconic hat. Many curiously regard this as better than 'Temple of Doom', yet for all its flaws and Kate Capshaw's shrillness, the second movie feels like a motion picture of its own whereas 'Crusade' is more of a rehash of 'Raiders' than a tribute to it. The plots are near identical, with Nazi bad guys and a Biblical artifact McGuffin, and neither 'Raiders' nor 'Crusade' can match the non-stop action thrills and humour of 'Temple of Doom' with most of the comic relief this time coming from Denholm Elliott being turned into a bumbling old man. All three films are technically well-made and riveting at their utmost best. As popular as 'Last Crusade' is, personal preferences will likely determine whether one likes it the most of the original trilogy or not.",

And why not? After all, Harrison Ford's rugged hero was already a public icon, and had made his way into cinematic history, and it seemed that the masterful teaming of director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas could do no wrong, without question knowing how to deliver an intelligent but still supremely entertaining film.

280,3 August 2014,wilcox18,10, Wasn't sure at first but was amazed by the turnout of this film!!!,"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was an action packed, adventurous movie. The character costumes and the settings for the scenes were all appropriate for the 1930's. Early on in the movie, Henry ""Indiana"" Jones Jr., played by Harrison Ford, learns from Walter Donovan that his father Henry Jones, played by Sean Connery, has gone missing while searching for the Grail. One day, Indy receives in the mail his father's diary of all his research and soon realizes that he would not send this to Indy unless something was wrong. The theme throughout this movie shows how a father and sons relationships can be so strong with one mission in common; finding the Holy Grail. Another film that demonstrates a father son's relationship is Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner. Indy and a local museum owner Marcus Brody, played by Denholm Elliott, travel to Venice in search of Henry. After countless fights, battles, and struggles, Indy is reunited with his father. One thing that I found frustrating with this movie was that the action scenes were so loud and was constantly having to turn the TV down. When it was a calm scene with just the characters talking, I could barely hear them and had to turn the TV back up. This may have been just my version on the movie but I was constantly turning the volume up and down. ",

I was 17 years young and cast as a civilian along with my father (they didn't require any women, my mother was disappointed). I always remember wearing a flat cap and a swastika on my arm (I was very tempted to keep the swastika as a memento of the film). The part that we were in was when the soldiers were marching around a large fire and Indian Jones bumped into Adolf. The funny thing is that the books that was being thrown on to the fire were actually old British Telecom phone directories. That fire was extinguished about ten times by a fire brigade every time the scene was stopped and re-lit when they were ready for another shot. The building used for the Adolf/diary scenes was also used near the start of the film when Indiana is pursued by the students to his office and he climbs out of the back window. I was able to get very close to Harrisson Ford and Steven Spielberg the time they shot the scene when Indiana went to retrieve the diary from the blonde Nazi (sorry I forget her name).

It is also a sign of respect, as I believe that his portrayal as 007 James Bond was an inspiration for 'Junior'. It is certainly the funniest Indie film. It was the perfect ending to a very personal and favourite trilogy, and I will try to ignore George Lucas' greedy fourth money making film. Because that is all it was, a quick money making scheme that upset and betrayed many, many fans. But like I said, I wont dwell on that and I will discard it as part of the trilogy. ",

Julian Glover has his usual polish performance and always makes a good villain, but again ""me me me"" is all important to him and he willingly lets others do his dirty world.

John Rhys-Davies doesn't have as an effective part as in the 1st one, but always good to have him in a film for what he adds, this one is no exception. Speilberg has done much better with other films. not one of his better ones in my view",

Today, i watch this movie, and feel that same sense of action, thrills and adrenaline that was pumped into the movie by director Steven Spielberg and writer George Lucas. The movies were based on Saturday Night Matinees from the 1920's, which was a plus. Sean Connery and Harrison Ford are perfect, and, for those of you that didnt get the 500 year old knight part, he drank from the holy grail, and stayed there, because he didnt cross the seal, protecting the grail until someone took his place.",

Suffice to say, the Holy Grail is not really the most important thing in this film. It is a pretext for a series of unlikely adventures and misadventures that includes an Arab cult, rats, a crusader's tomb, Nazis, secret passage ways, zepellins, a Pasha with a passion for automobiles, an unlikely battle with a tank, and a temple with boob-traps that could only have been put there by the all-mighty God, who (judging from the film) has a really dark sense of humor.",

This, plus Alison Doody - easily the least distinguished leading lady of the series - and an incoherent plot that veers all over Europe and the Middle East with little dramatic gain, leaves a forgettable film. ""Raiders"" evokes images of 1930s and '40s-era adventure films - only with better production values. ""Temple of Doom"" is like a carnival ride - even to the point of including a runaway mine train!

Indiana saw this, but then got himself into the same scenario and even though he saw the girl dying of selfishness, he at first tried to do the same... the first thing is when he got up he could've just used his whip to take the grail as he is very good at catching stuff with his whip... but he did not.

This movie offers all what I expect from this genre: action, adventure, nice places and sceneries, good story, thrills, suspense, and some good jokes. I think that all these elements justify to bring this great work from Steven Spielberg in line with the fast paced James Bond movies. Another important and positive point is that all the special effects have been executed without too much computer-generated imagery. Finally the film was accompanied with a wonderfully tuned sound track from star composer John Williams. I will add this DVD definitely in best of collection.

It also has innovative VFX for its time and has a great soundtrack and action.

I didn't quite get the young Indiana Jones thing and the Sean Connery part where he plays Indiana's father.

In stepped George Lucas to politely remind Spielberg that they had an agreement to make another Indiana Jones picture, Spielberg no doubt obliged and humble, passed on his Rain Man work to Barry Levinson who promptly bagged himself an Oscar for the film. It can be guessed that Spielberg was probably grouchy around this period, but he needn't have worried, because The Last Crusade provided a much needed hit for not only himself (post Empire Of The Sun), but also Lucas (Willow) and Harrison Ford (Frantic).",

They took the ""buddy movie"" concept away from cop films and based the film on the hugely funny Indiana-Dad relationship. Sean Connery and Harrison Ford positively spark on screen as the combative Jones'. The Nazi element which makes sure all the cinema-goers will boo in unison means that the ""baddie"" is as bad as they can get. Basically Indy and the armies of darkness are involved in a desperate quest to be the first to locate the Holy Grail, the cup that Jesus Christ used at the Last Supper. His old friends Marcus Brody and Salah - wonderfully played by Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies - are back and this gives the idea of a trilogy being completed and thus is the end of the saga.

The Knight with a look on his face of disappointment (waiting 700 years for someone worthy to take his place) raises his hand in farewell.
Really? He should have been giving our heros the middle single finger salute. He waited 700 years, healed Indy's father, and despite warning them, they bungle up the temple?
Okay, sooooo what now? Did the chamber put itself back together again? You know, a divine reset, or something like that? What about the Knight himself? He can't die, he's immortal, and you can't sell me that the cup was lost forever, I don't buy it. There's a reason for that cup being where it was.

The plot kept me glued to the screen and I was interested through the whole film. Sean Connery is surprisingly fantastic at playing Indy's father. Once again Harrison Ford was brilliant. The supporting cast play their roles perfectly and the film is very realistic. My favourite scene is where Indy is trying to reach the cup while dangling over a ledge and his father looks at him and calls him Indiana. The sets are great and well made. Another scene which was well made was the boat chase on Venice and was well directed by my favourite director...Steven Spielberg.,

It's not as breathlessly paced as ""Temple..."" because the makers were working on the assumption that this was going to be the last, so they wanted to tie up some loose ends. I would suggest, however, that if you were to watch only ONE instalment from the trilogy, this would be the one to choose to give you the most compact flavour of what the series is like as a whole (I DON'T recommend you do this BTW. watch 'em all!)",

For a time I cooled on it, thinking it to be a retread of the masterpiece 'Raiders' and now I find myself somewhat in the middle. For one thing, it is a retread of 'Raiders'. The plot is followed to the tee, the Nazi are looking for a religious artifact they can't grasp the significance of and Indiana Jones is the force of good in their way. In some ways though I really don't mind this. Spielberg and Ford care enough about their classic hero to merely engage in repetition. The thing that really makes me continue to love 'Last Crusade' is how it follows the best aspect of 'Raiders'. 'Last Crusade' acknowledges the fact that Indiana Jones is a human being beneath the fedora. He can be scarred emotionally and physically. This is evident by not just the relationship with his Father but also his search for the Holy Grail, which really is the pinnacle of finds.",

Originally Lucas wanted to make this movie about a haunted house, but since Spielberg had already produced Poltergeist he had no interest in making another one.

381,9 June 2004,Okonh0wp,10, ****: Best sequel ever,"Those who say the Godfather II is the only really good sequel, need to take another close look at this movie. I honestly do not get why this movie is so overlooked. Raiders of the Lost Ark  is acclaimed by critics as one of the greatest of all time, and it was very popular, but I personally think that this movie goes a step beyond the original. It has a lot going for it. For one, let's go to the fascinating religion verse science concept that presents itself in here. In the original, the ark appears, and everything is restored back to normal. A consequence-free, direct line from Point A to Point B ending. This one the whole issue is building up inside. The stakes are raised until Indiana Jones himself is presented with the ultimate challenge: disreguard everything about archeology and make a leap of faith. Additionally, the father-son relationship is great. The chemistry between the two glamorous stars is amazing. How often does a hero got involved in some kind of father-son dynamic. The complexities of their relationship are displayed through the subtleties in their conversations. They make a great team too. Their interactions are comical and almost-TV like but there's also a lot of noticeable sediment and chemistry. The status relationship is very interesting. As a kid, who obeyed his father without question. I love how Indiana's father is clearly less qualified to fight off the Nazis and is really an obstacle to Indiana, yet the whole father-is-superior complex exists. Sean Connery's character is difenitiely multi-demensional. He's passionate, educated, smart, a little touristy, and has a little touch of that James Bond charisma. Harrison Ford is riveting as always as the likable Indiana Jones. As for the villans, we got the seductive-but-passionate Austrian Archeologist and the professor. Of course, don't forget the equally intriguing and quirky sidekicks which include the clumsy but smart Marcus Brody, and Sallah, who was in Raiders of the Lost Ark. If that isn't enough, how about the whole Nazi angle, and the good vs evil, that's very delicately played into the story. Who could make a better enemy than the Nazis? And I love the tracing Indy from birth to adulthood idea, where parallels are drawn between the Cross of Coronado, his smile, and his hat. The story is cleverly set in different settings, where we really have a sense of segments. It's like a story happens in Venice and a completely different story happens in Saudi Arabia or Austria. Every part of the story line is plausible and well-crafted. And lastly, thumbs up for the action. Not as good as the original movie, but still always clever, always dramatic, and always exciting. The action is clouded with miles of suspense, from the boat chasing scene, to the one with the tanks in the desert, to the scene where they outrun the Nazis in the forest. In short, this movie is incredible, packed with non-stop action, fun, and adventure.",
382,21 November 2008,darren shan,7, Third outing for Indy,"The third Indy movie sees him go after his father, who has been kidnapped while searching for the Holy Grail. Indy doesn't believe in the mythical Grail, but his father, the leading lady and the Nazis all do! Great fun. A bit too formulaic, but it has its twists and surprises, and Connery is an inspired addition as Indy's eccentric Pa. Has a good beginning, too, with Phoenix starring as the young Indy. A pity he never grew up to play an older one ... The only real downside is the finale (filmed in the stunning location of Petra). It's incredibly weak and left me scowling. Apart from that, this is probably the second best of the series.",
383,25 January 2021,alexpeychev,10, Outstanding finale (or is it the finale?),"""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" was supposed to be the final movie in the ""Indiana Jones"" series. the ""Last Crusade"" was a fitting end to a great movie series. Harrison Ford returns for his third go around as swashbuckling hero Indiana Jones, this time accompanied by Sean Connery as Indy's father, Dr. Henry Jones. These two actors work beautifully together as they fight off the Nazis in search for the Holy Grail. Two actors from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" reprise their roles to great effect in ""Last Crusade"": Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah. Alison Doody is the heroine (good or bad?); Julian Glover is the villain; River Phoenix portrays a young Indy at the beginning to see how this character really got his start. ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" not only has great characters, it also has a decent story (taking place in 1938), plus exciting action scenes and special effects. It's better than the second film ""Temple of Doom"" and comes very close to topping the first film ""Raiders"". The ""Indiana Jones"" series should stay right where it is with the ""Last Crusade"" as the finale. Unless Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford can prove us wrong and make a really good fourth film in the series, we shall see. I loved all three movies in the ""Indiana Jones"" series. If the fourth film does gets made, I hope it'll be equally as good as the first three.",

389,2 December 2002,don_corleone81,10, Fortune and Glory,"I recently revisted Last Crusade, and this third installment in the series is as strong as I remember it in 1989. It is pure adventure, mixed with plenty of self-satirizing humor that evokes a certain sentimentality for fans of the series. I disagree with many who feel that this is the weakest effort put forth by Spielberg and Lucas, and instead, place it a close second to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Last Crusade combines a seamless blend of adventure, humor and romance, with an unrelenting pace of action that takes the audience on an unforgettable journey in search of the Holy Grail. The brilliant addition of Sean Connery as Indy's father, may be one of the best cast father/son duos of recent memory and Connery steals almost nearly every scene he is given. The film's cast of familiar faces including the late Denholm Elliot and John Rhy-Davies reprising earlier roles, gives the viewer the comfort of recognition that a sequel should deliver. As for the swashbuckling archaeologist, Harrison Ford gives his most confident portrayal of Indiana, and his performance here just re-emphasizes the fact that Ford truly embodies yet another one of the most memorable characters in movie history (Han Solo, anyone?). In fact, a fourth movie would assuredly revive Ford's fizzling career, and introduce a ""real"" movie hero to a generation of new viewers. This one is a must-see for anyone who hasn't already, and a chance for those who have to remember how timeless this movie truly is.",
390,12 June 2013,mickael-jaguenaud,9, A must view !,"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade took five years to get off the ground, due in large part to schedule issues with Harrison Ford and Steven Spielberg. Audiences greeted the return of Indiana Jones enthusiastically (one wonders if the same will be true of the fourth installment, which follows a nineteen year absence). The film was the second highest grossing picture of the year, trailing only Batman and finishing ahead of a number of other high-profile sequels, including Back to the Future II, Lethal Weapon 2, and Star Trek V. The mixture of action, comedy, and romance provided in Raiders of the Lost Ark has been imitated many times over the years, but never matched. Of all the pretenders, The Last Crusade is among the few to have come close, and a lot of that has to do with the movie's three invaluable assets: star Harrison Ford, co-star Sean Connery, and director Steven Spielberg. So, while The Last Crusade is not the second coming of Raiders of the Lost Ark, it's as worthy a sequel as any is likely to be.",

The boat chase is well staged, the hunt for Sir Richard's tomb is well crafted, and the rats are fun. But by far some of the greatest stuff in the film are the action scenes. From the opening chase to the race to the exit from the earthquake at the end, the film's action scenes are some of the best I've seen in a late 80's film. But then again, the end truck chase in Licence to Kill hasn't been topped. And of course I must mention Sean Connery.

399,3 May 2020,zeekwunlau,8, father and son CP,"Needless to say, this is a successful commercial movie, which combines all the essential elements of commercial movies.
The director is Steven Spielberg, one of the screenwriters is George Lucas, starring Harrison Ford, Sean Connery, Rui Fan Phoenix.
Although I do n't like certain commercial movies very much, this lineup is also quite high-profile, but it 's all floating clouds for me. Anyway, I came to Lord Sean Connery.
The plot is compact and coherent, the logic is rigorous, and it is done in one go. The fighting scenes and the chasing scenes are also very exciting. You ca n't stop watching if you want to stop.
The beginning of the film is a very classic train chase and fight plot, Rui Fan Phoenix's performance is quite brilliant, many people think of the Phoenix River forever.
This movie has added comedy elements, making it into an adventure treasure hunt comedy movie.
This film can basically be summarized as the story of Jones and his least tacit dad and pig teammates adventure treasure hunting. The father and the son took risks and laughed along the way to seek reconciliation, and the pig team dragged their feet behind to deal with bad things friendly. Of course, in the end, there must be a happy ending. After watching all the comedy, no one wants to end the tragedy.
The film once asked Tom Stoppard to rewrite the dialogue between Jones and his son, no wonder that the dialogue between them is humorous and interesting.
The comedy bridge and laughs of the entire film are focused on the relationship between Dr. Henry Jones played by Sean and the curator played by Denholm Eliot and the father and son of Jones.
I didn't expect Sean to have such a strong talent for comedy. Henry Jones was all smiles. Wearing a round hat, matching glasses, plus a leather bag and an umbrella, this outfit is also amusing.
When Old Jones appeared, he treated his son as a Nazi, and later distressed that the porcelain of his son was broken. After discovering that it was a fake, he laughed and laughed. This father is really no one. When his son discovered that his father was not distressed, he was filled with that helpless disappointment.
So the father and son embarrassed and did not tacit understanding of the adventure began.
The son asked his dad to use a lighter to burn the ropes that bound them, and the result was a self-defeating fire, which triggered the fire while avoiding the fire. The father and son sat in front of the turning door and looked at a house of Nazis.
When there was no way to escape, my dad shouted and said that he would sit down and think about it, which just touched the exit mechanism, so his son crawled to the exit. I have to tremble with a smile when I write here.
When his son cleverly got rid of the Nazi chase on a motorcycle and looked happily at his father, he hoped to get a response, but the old Jones wiped his glasses boringly. He didn't feel anything exciting.
The son dragged his dad away, but the dad always slowed down.
Finally, he and I got into the airship, and finally the father and son could start the warm chat mode. The dad sat with his eyes wide open and waited for a chat with his son, but the son found out that he really had nothing to say to his dad. He could only talk about work.
The gap between their father and son is that the father thinks he knows his son very well and thinks he is the second himself. The son does not need him. The son felt that his father had never cared about him, and he always ignored himself.
In the end, Old Jones changed his name to ""Indiana"" instead of ""Junior"" in order to wake up his son.
Although it is the father and son with no tacit understanding, it is definitely the best father and son CP.",

He is joined by his dad Henry Sean Connory on his mission. He is joined by Marcus Broody ( Denholm Elliot) and John Rhy Davis. In Venice they meet Elsa the seductive Blonde who meets her maker at the end of the story. They Fight Nazis and have the time of their lives. My only complaint is when they are in the grail temple that Elsa's death spoils the whole film. The scenario is that the grail lies past 3 challenges and to get it Indiana Jones must have faith in himself. He is forced to get the grail after Henry is shot. When he does and Henry is healed it seems everything has turned out all right until Elsa tries to leg it with the grail. It is not meant to be and Elsa is left hanging over a hole in the ground with her free hand on Indy, However she seems more concerned with reaching the grail which is close but she cannot quite reach,Suddenley she slips and falls screaming to her death into the mist at the bottom of the hole wherever that is. Which leaves viewers pondering over the question what is down there? will she ever be found again?. Where does her body fall?. Anyway as soon as Elsa has done her death scene it is nearly repeated with Indy trying to reach the grail he cant and is forced to give up with his father holding on to him. And the film ends with Indy Sallah Marcus and Henry galloping off into the sunset. Which is a bit strange because a main character has just died. Anyway apart from the ending its a great film. Elsa was also a Nazi. 100/100",

403,25 September 2001,Dockelektro,10, All the way up.,"One of the films that marked my childhood, this Indiana Jones flick is the best, from my point of view. The sets are astonishing, the music is incredible, and the addition of Sean Connery as Henry Jones Sr. is genius, as he and Harrison Ford manage to give birth to Spielberg's finest comedy ever. The theme here is the Holy Grail, a fantastic follow-up to the ark antics of years earlier. The bad guys are the nazis again, but this time the enemy is more subtle and treacherous. As a character says, ""don't trust anyone"". And the quest for the grail allows us to embark on the ride of our lives, as we are taken in boat, plane, car, bike and train chases, as we see the incredible action (the initial sequence of young indy is my favorite) and as I even get to see Indy fighting in a boat off the shore of my country (complete with boxes written in portuguese)!

I consider the first one to be the best due to its iconicity and ive never felt the same for the other 3 movies, but this one is the closest to the original. It has a great amount of iconic moments, its even funnier due tot he father son dinamic, the nazis have returned as the villains which is great, and the adventure of finding the holy grail is super exciting. I dont think it stands out among other movies for any more reasons besides its story, which is great and period.",
405,16 June 2013,bananaguy42,10, Tied with the Original,"I'd say this is tied with the original ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" The dialogue and action mixes really well from beginning to end between both Indiana and his father. The holy grail was a very interesting artifact and made for a very interesting story. The entire movie includes some very famous scenes, including the boat scene, the library scene, and the second half of the movie is spot-on terrific. This is a great action movie and shows the power and desperate desire for immortality. This movie ended on a high note, and it should have ended that way. My advice is you shouldn't watch the fourth movie, though. This is a better ending then it could ever be. Plus, the soundtrack is amazing. Great to watch for fathers day, that's my plan",
406,28 April 2020,krational66,7, An adventure film in the age of Cold Weapons,"Speaking of the action-adventure films of the 1980s, or the representative of entertainment blockbuster, there is no doubt that it is the trilogy of the treasure hunt. Many of the post-80s people may be like me, and they have been named for a long time. Finally, by the spring breeze of the fourth strong attack, I observed the first three steps.
The adventure films of the cold weapon era, unlike the 21st century adventure action films such as national treasures or other entertainment movies, the biggest difference must be that there are basically no computer stunts, even if there are, it seems to be a piece of cake today. Too.
Secondly, I found that the films used to like snakes, worms, and ants. The trilogy is full of a variety of disgusting small animals. Could it be that people's aesthetics were like that?
Third, the heroes of those years were all solitary heroes of single horses, and all of them defeated a large group of people alone, reminding me of the gallant dragon and the mighty, and there are many action movies of that era, all in this mode. . It seems that Jackie Chan still taught a lot to Hollywood.
Fourth, the movies of that era were still dominated by patriarchalism. The male pig's feet must have been an iron camp, and the female ones must have been running soldiers. One episode of the movie changed for a heroine, and like the movie of 007, it never explained where the heroine of the previous episode went. Moreover, the male bishop still pretended to be a long-lasting affectionate, as opposed to Xinhuan in the new movie. Still the 21st century movies are more humane. Look at Spider-Man. The three films are monogamous. At best, you can play with the emotional little waves in the teacup. There are also adults from Shrek and pirates. One good example after another. In the cold weapon era, love is cheaper",
407,8 February 2001,Indy-52,9, one of the finest action/adventure films ever made.,"How do you make an Indiana Jones film even better? By adding Sean Connery to the cast. With the one two punch of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery, it is pretty darn difficult to come up with a bad final product. When you add Steven Spielberg as the director and George Lucas as producer and one of the writers, all the elements are there for a spectacular film experience. Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade does not disappoint on any level. Other than the fact that this has long been reputed to be the last film in the series. One can not be just a little sad that this much talent may never collaborate again to make another one of these films that really represent why people love going to the movies.",

It has a great plot, some great one-liners, great action scenes, great music, and that's about everything you can expect from any Indiana Jones movie. ""The Mummy"", a perfect example of a failed adventure film, had none of these qualities. It had boring characters, a boring plot, cheap effects, and stupid lines. This could be even better a movie than ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", which would make THIS the best adventure film of all time. There are so many reasons why this is such a great ending to such a great film series. It tells you more about Indy's background in a wonderful opening where we see him as a kid. The scenes in Venice are greatly entertaining and look a lot like they come from a Bond flick. It has a great scene where Indy accidentally runs into Hitler himself, and he signs him an autograph! That scene is funnier and more clever than anything else in the series. There are many other funny and exciting scenes in the film, but the part that really stands out is the ending: it's very powerful, it's exciting, it's awe-ispiring, and it's emotional unlike any other scene in the Indy films. In the very end, you even find out how our hero got his weird name. ",

It kicks off with a great action sequence (Phoenix is spot on as a young Indy),which is followed by another great action sequence in Venice. But for me the film really becomes one of my all time favorite action-adventure films once we meet Jones Sr. The chemistry between Ford and Connery is golden. I have seen the film countless times but it manages to bring a smile on my face every single time. The action is superb, but it is the performance of these great legends (a droll one-liner here, a smirky smile there) that makes those scene timeless.",

All the great elements from the past two Indiana Jones films are delved into an epic third instalment of the franchise. By many people, Last Crusade will be considered the funniest of the trilogy. But it is both Connery and Ford that carry the over the top excitement and in-deniable funniness that makes the film both memorable and funny on both levels. Speilburg is considered one of the greatest directors ever lived, and he vividly proves so in this film alone that he can direct majestically. Harrison Ford has never been better as in a Indiana Jones film, and he certainly doesn't look any different from the fist one. By all means, Indiana Jones is back and better than ever, delivering the hype and brilliance of one of the greatest cinema characters of all time.",

418,26 August 2008,kyle-cruse,9, The best Indiana Jones movie,"What a great film. This is one of the few times the third film in a series turned out to be the best. Most people probably consider ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" to be more of a classic than this film, but ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" proved to be the most enjoyable, in my opinion. This film has just as much potential of being a classic as the original. Consider the famous shot of Indy's hat being placed on his head for the first time. The flashback shots to Indiana Jones as a kid are masterfully done. Sean Connery, as Indiana Jones' dad, is a perfect addition to the film and, as usual, manages to steal every scene he is in (my favorite being ""I should've mailed it to the Marx Brothers.""). Following Indy through the path to the Holy Grail toward the end of the film is likely the best scene, with excellent camera-work and unpredictable scenarios he finds himself in. The scene in which Indy and his father must move from a blimp to a plane to a car in just minutes is a perfect example of how much fun this film can be to watch. Some of the fighting scenes can drag on a little, however, which tends to be a problem with all of the Indiana Jones movies. Nevetheless, this one is still the best and leaves me with very little room to complain.",
419,3 May 2003,SpaceMonkey-Mafioso,8," Great Entertainment, BUT ...","Last Crusade is great entertainment and a rousing adventure, but for it to be ranked above E.T. is blasphemy. I'm sure Spielberg would testify to that. Last Crusade really tackles no new ground that the first two Indy pics didn't cover- aside from the whole Indy's father thing. Even Temple of Doom is better. Doom is a more original film because it tries new things and helped bring about the PG-13 rating. It's also more true to the Indy films inspiration- adventure movies of the 30's and 40's- like Gunga Din. Crusade feels more like a very well done reunion pic. If you seek entertainment and a very solid closing to the trilogy, then Last Crusade fits the bill. Just don't proclaim it one of Spielberg's best. It ain't even close.",

But after escaping from being crushed by a rock, his bag strap suddenly no longer restricts his movement. In the invisible bridge scene he crosses the bridge on faith alone and then scatters dirt to reveal the bridge. He could have used dirt to reveal the bridge in the first place. In another escape scene Indy drives away with his father on a motorbike with side car. But he doesn't wait for the Germans in the boat to motor off the shore. There are only two sections of the story that involve the Holy Grail. The rest of the story is once again about Nazi Germany. In general, the story relies too much upon comedy to see it through.",

422,2 October 2006,ryan_kuhn,9," ""Germany has declared war on the Jones boys.""","The third movie in a movie franchise is a difficult one to make. People who enjoyed the first 2 movies have aspects of the films they love and want to see again, but there is a risk of being repetitive. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade does feature elements of the previous movies that fans would enjoy (Nazis, chase sequences, religious relics, snakes) and brand new elements that appeals to everyone. Brand new to the saga in this movie is Sean Connery's role as Indiana's father, Dr. Henry Jones. An aloof father, consumed by finding the Holy Grail, Connery plays the detached father very well, opening up to Indy only after he thinks he's dead; no one is surprised that Indiana was raised by such a role model. The elder Jones has gone missing, leaving the younger in quest to find him. This adventure leads Indiana on the path to find the Holy Grail as well, trying to retrace his father's steps. This first takes Indiana and Denholm Elliot's Dr. Marcus Brody to Venice, where they meet Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody). A trip through the catacombs of a Venice church and a Bonds-esquire boat chase through the city's canals reveals the truth of Dr. Henry Jones' location, setting into motion a trip through Italy, Austria, Germany, and finally finishing somewhere in the Holy Lands. The Nazis are featured again as the villains, with the full power of the Third Reich chasing down the Jones family. Sallah returns, first trying to protect the inept Brody (perfectly set up by an Indiana speech), then as Indiana's traveling companion who likes to collect camels. This is the funniest of the Indiana Jones movies, with several sly, dry moments of wit, most at the expense of poor Dr. Brody. This movie features planes, zeppelins, cars, tanks, motorcycles, boats, and trains, all of which are the backdrop to this adventure film. On equal footing as the original Raider of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a worthy adventure to (momentary at least) finish off the franchise.",

Raiders was very good, Temple of Doom was rather disappointing(except for the casting of Bollywood veteran Amrish Puri) but The Last Crusade matches the brilliance the Raiders and even exceeds it. First of all there was the casting of former Bond actor Sean Connery as Indy's father(actually Julian Glover was also associated with Bond, he came in For Your Eyes Only). The Last Crusade is pretty much one great stunt after another but it is so breathtaking you can't help but be completely awestruck by it. There is even a decent enough plot, which nowadays gets forgotten in fun summer flicks of today. It's opening sequence is probably the best out of the entire franchise. It is even laced with some humour. The Last Crusade was released in 89, the year of the big movies, Ghostbusters 2,Batman,Honey I shrunk the kids but The Last Crusade held its own and was a huge success. Then in 2008 my worst nightmare was confirmed, the release of Kingdom of the lost skulls which had none of the brilliance of the original If only Mr Spielberg had left it at three and had not made Kingdom,which added nothing to the franchise other than to make a few thousand more dollars for Mr Spielberg.",

434,6 March 2023,mjpiro,7, The Second Best Indiana Jones Movie So Far!!,"The Indiana Jones movie franchise is widely considered a rich and treasured franchise by their fans and common movie goers alike and in the pantheon of the four films out so far the Last Crusade falls just behind Raiders of the Lost Arc in terms of fan's favorite's. First off, all of the movies are great movies but I can peck holes at some of the grossness of the monkey brains and open-heart sacrifices in Temple of Doom that disgust some audiences and some of the unbelievability that has to do with aliens landing on Earth then flying back to space at the end of The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull that irks some viewers. Again both great movies that I enjoyed just not as much as films one and three. In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade we get to meet Indiana's dad & of course he had to be played by none other than Sean Connery. It is interesting to note that when George Lucas and Steven Spielberg were developing Indiana Jones on the beaches of Hawaii at a vacation after the success of the first Star Wars movie, they were basing the character of Jones on James Bond of the British spy movies, so it only seems fitting that everyone's favorite Bond play Jones' dad! In The Last Crusade - as I will call it for short - Jones is tasked with finding the cup of Christ, the actual cup that Jesus drank from during the last supper before his execution. Originally this assignment was tasked to the elder Jones, someone more academically versed on the subject, but the Nazi's kidnapped him putting Indiana into play. Many fun twists and turns occur in this movie that is very much a buddy movie, very much a father-son movie, and very much a family movie. The acting is tremendous, the writing is great, the soundtrack is outstanding, the costuming is fine, and it simply is a fun way to spend a couple hours with friends and/or family and learn a few things in the process!! 7 out of 10 stars!!",

Indiana, played by Harrison Ford, seems to always end up in the wrong place at the right time. The same is true of the previous 2 installments of this trilogy, we don't talk about the 4th Indiana Jones. The editing in the film is spot on along with the use of the camera to signal the end of a scene and the movie to the next. As is the tradition in all of the films in the trilogy during times of travel a map is used and the stops highlighted with the flight path and the change of direction. This serves well to set the tone that the film will take place in some far way place. I believe that the Indiana Jones trilogy served well to be recreated in the new century as ""National Treasure"". The plot and the character development is the same, right down to the dad who's just not as quick as the main character.
Overall, the film was good. It's a predicable story that is a good blend of fact and fiction. It's the best kind of story, one that blends the fiction elements with the fact and makes it hard to tell the difference.",
441,25 September 2016,moviemattb,9, This Movie Has Chosen Wisely,"After the second Indiana Jones movie being a dark film, Steven Spielberg want the third film to be toned down as a lighter film while being dark for a little bit. If that is not all, Spielberg want to show the human side of Indy, while having a relationship with his father Henry Jones Sr. Anything else? Showing the backstory of Indy as a teenager in 1912 where he gets a scar on his chin as well as being afraid by snakes, using the whip and getting the hat; that was George Lucas' idea, by the way. With that said, the movie takes place in 1938 as Indy goes on an adventure to not only search for the Holy Grail that deals with everlasting eternal life, but to search his father while reconnecting with him. The movie itself is still nowhere near on the same level as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" but it is about as close as it is ever going to get. Spielberg's direction is really outstanding, and really still keeps his audience to be entertain. The movie is also very well written by Jeffrey Boam. The acting is also fantastic as Harrison Ford is still the best as he is Indiana Jones. No questions ask. I really do enjoy seeing Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies returning as Marcus Brody and Sallah. Alison Doody is also really good as playing Dr. Elsa Schneider, and fun as a bad Indy girl. Julian Glover, on the other hand, is good but sadly not as intimidating as Belloq and Mola Ram. As for Sean Connery, he gave such a delightful performance for bringing humor into the table as well as having a great chemistry with Ford. Can't forget about River Phoenix, who is also really good to play the younger version of Indy. If this movie hadn't feature a young Indy, then there wouldn't be ""The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"" TV show. I've never seen the show, but I might need to give it a look. John Williams' music is really wonderful to hear as you still hear the Indy theme, and hearing the theme of the father and son relationship. The special effects by ILM are terrific, but like the second film there are some effects that look dated. For example, the scene where Indy throws a Nazi officer out of the zeppelin for having no ticket; the officer gets up and yells at a zeppelin as he being filmed against a blue screen. The action scenes are also exciting, and very well handled. ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" is better than the second Indy movie, but still not on par with the first Indy movie. Nevertheless, this movie has chosen wisely. I gave this movie a 9 out of 10. Now the franchise has laid to rest, Indiana Jones will return until 2008 where we have a movie that deals with aliens, nuking in a refrigerator and leaving audiences feeling empty. Stay tuned as I review a movie that really deserves another chance, and that is ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.""",

The story with the Grail is interesting, far-fetched of course, but it adds an interesting element of depth to the old good guys - bad guys theme. The pacing of the film is excellent, it is a wild roller-coaster ride from beginning to end that never slackens. We meet a whole range of different characters, each portrayed as individuals with more depth than usual in this type of movie. The interaction between Indiana and his father is believable and again makes this film different and better than the run of the mill action flick. Locations, stunts, train, boat and plane chases, even a tank battle - there is enough here to satisfy any action junkie.",

444,28 January 2008,scott-sw,9, Great fun,"The first time I saw Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, I thought it was okay. The more I saw it, though, the more I liked it. Indiana Jones must find his missing father who was searching for the Holy Grail. Donovan (Julian Glover) dispatches Dr. Jones and Marcus (Denholm Eliot) to Italy where he meets Dr. Schneider (Allison Dody). After a couple of attempts on their lives, they find their way to Austria and locate the elder Dr. Jones (Sean Connery). The Nazis, too, are after the Holy Grail and kidnapped the elder Dr. Jones in hope to find his notebook. It eventually falls into their hands, giving them an edge on finding the ancient relic. This one has it all: fights, chases, comedy, the father-son relationship, beautiful women, and really mean bad-guys. While I liked Temple of Doom, I liked this one much better for several reasons. The first is the introduction in which we meet a young Indiana Jones played by River Phoenix. We learn how he got the scar, his morbid fear of snakes, and his adventurous impulses. The action sequences are also well done. The scene in the dungeon with the oil gives the audience a claustrophobic sense. Following is a great boat chase. There is also a good dogfight scene. The best is the tank scene when Indy is trying to rescue his Dad. Another thing I liked was that the female lead, Dody, was a strong woman who does not appear to be all she is. Not to give it away, but her romantic interests are selfish. This does not allow it to blossom into love, and keeps the movie from being predictable. Also, I liked the villain in this one. Julian Glover's depiction of Donovan is good, giving him a subtle sinister side along with some depth. I really liked Vogel (David Byrne) as the Nazi Commander. In the first movie, we hated the Nazis just because they were Nazis. Byrne, though, portrays evil, impatience, and anger so much better--making you loath him for his character. I liked the incorporation of previous stars like Denholm Eliot and John Rys Davis (Sallah) who were both in the original. Finally, I loved the chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery as the father and son who could not connect. They made it believable, funny, and entertaining. The best scene is when they are aboard a Zepplin and cannot think of a thing to talk about. I still contest that Raiders of the Lost Ark is a superior film, mostly because of the originality. But the Last Crusade is darn close to capturing that freshness once again.",
445,13 August 2017,The_Ultimate_Hippo,1, One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"OK, let me start by saying that I loved the Indiana Jones franchise up until this point. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of my all time favorite films, I really enjoyed Temple of Doom (not as good as Raiders but still amazing), so I had very high hopes when I saw Last Crusade for the first time as many of my friends said it was the best in the series and I was very excited to see it for the first time and I assumed it was going to be one of the greatest films ever made. Well I was wrong, Last Crusade let me down more than any film I have ever watched. The opening prologue with River Phoenix was a horrible, contrived mess. Indy somehow gets his fear of snakes, his whip, his hat and his scar all in a matter of 10 minutes, River Phoenix while I have not seen any of his other work gave a god awful performance the ""this should be in a museum"" line makes me cringe every single time. Unfortunately after the opening ""1912"" sequence it doesn't get any better, Harrison Ford seems bored out of his mind and gives an incredibly dull performance, I didn't care much for him in Return of the Jedi and I don't care for him in this either. The supporting cast doesn't do any better, Alison Doody is a laughably atrocious and bland actress , Denholm Elliot is back however he is so different from how he was in Raiders that he might as well be a completely different character, and oh my god he is a complete moron who has been reduced to comic relief and to me is the ""Jar Jar Binks"" of the Indiana Jones franchise (yes I realize this came first). Julian Glover was an amazing Bond villain, I loved him in For Your Eyes Only and in his brief appearance in Empire Strikes Back, I don't know what happened here, again he gave an incredibly boring performance, he wasn't the least bit threatening and gave another terrible performance and then there is Sean Connery, one of the greatest actors ever who has basically been reduced to a bumbling idiot.

Maybe I'm a bit biased for I prefer watching old-school movies, that's how I call movies directed out of a funded script which provides an atmosphere I haven't seen in most of all recent action and adventure movies of today.

Well, how wrong I was.  Last Crusade is a GREAT movie! I go back and forth in my mind whether this or Raiders is the best of the series. I'd probably have to give Raiders the edge, just for the originality and the action sequences are slightly better, have more punch. But by even forcing me into a comparison, Last Crusade shows the kind of staying power it has.

469,3 July 2004,Tyler_R_Weston,10, The Last Crusade...The Hunt For The Holy Grail,"In my opinion, the Last Crusade is truly the best Indiana Jones adventure of the trilogy. In his latest adventure, Indiana Jones is on the hunt for the one and only Holy Grail, using clues that his father, played by Sean Connery, left behind. Once again, Indiana Jones has to fight off the Germans, who want their hands on the Holy Grail. Like all the other Indiana Jones films, the Last Crusade contains a sense of humor and in this case between father and son. My favorite scenes is the tank battle in the desert and inside the temple that holds the Holy Grail. Indiana Jones faces three intelligently made booby traps that his father had figured out with clues. If you don't believe me, watch the Last Crusade! The acting is once again brilliant and the work of Spielberg and Lucas are fantastic. I give this film an 11/10. Although this may be a long movie, it is definitely worth watching and no Indiana Jones fan should miss. Harrison Ford is once again the courageous and funny archaeologist who teams up with his explorer father, Professor Henry Jones. Truly the best adventure yet, the Last Crusade will amaze audiences everywhere. I have seen the conclusion of the current Indiana Jones adventures and I wish Spielberg, Lucas, Ford good luck on the fourth installment!",

479,17 September 2008,Dario_Gino,6, The finest adventure I've ever seen.,"My opinion of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade could be deemed slightly biased. It is the first film I ever saw in theaters and it's also the first movie I purchased on video. I even own the same, worn-down, beat-up copy (and look upon it even more fondly than the widescreen edition, for sentimental reasons, of course). I think it's fair to say it's this movie that cemented my love of cinema, the high regard I hold for great escapism, which is sorely lacking from today's cinema; movies that should be fun now drag or bludgeon themselves with relentless awful scripts or MTV-style direction that turns relatively simple scenes into chaotic blurs. The Last Crusade may only be thirteen years old, but I think I can safely say they don't make them like they used to. The film stars, of course, Harrison Ford as Indy Jones, the archaeologist/adventurer who's on yet another quest, this time to find his father, who'd been searching for the Holy Grail. Said Dad is played by none other than Sean Connery, whose highly charismatic performance is quick to place this film above the others in the trilogy. The rest of the film focuses on this ongoing journey between father and son (eventually joined along by Sallah and Marcus Brody), complete with amazing action and stunt sequences, clever humor, and nasty (but fun) surprises. The script, by Jeffrey Boam, takes a few cues from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but actually improves upon that story by adding more characterization, particularly with origin of Indy himself. And as a whole, the story is more engrossing because there are more fun clues offered toward the location of the Holy Grail and, thus, more engaging little discoveries (love the ""X marks the spot"" scene). I'm quite certain, like with Raiders, the plot has a few holes, but they're fairly hard to notice, and I've seen the movie quite a few times, but maybe it's just my enjoyment of the film clouding that up, which I suppose speaks volumes in favor of Spielberg's direction and the performances. Given that action and adventure is the series' selling point, you can expect the thrills and wondrous delight of discovery delivered in spades. The action scenes are terrific (and matched well with John Williams' rousing, memorable score), the best being an excellent ten-minute setpiece on board (and in) a Nazi tank in a sensational chase sequence across the desert. The climax, complete with frightening booby traps, is a suspenseful venture into the unknown, which is the pinnacle adventure movies aspire to. Harrison Ford once again slides effortlessly into the role of Jones, delivering another first-rate turn. To some, the performance is a joke; to most, it's acting at its finest. But I think most everyone would agree nobody else could have fit the part half as well as Ford. It's his rapport with Connery that strikes that spark that separates this from 99% of the genre. They craft an uncannily touching, funny, and genuine bond unlike any duo in film history. You could call it a buddy picture, I suppose, but unlike any you've ever seen before. The Last Crusade is a knockout thrill ride, and I seriously doubt any action/adventure will ever surpass it.",

489,4 June 2022,kimpalonen,1, Outdated portrayal of aging in Hollywood,"The reason the Last Crusade fails to be enticing the way the previous movies were is because it's all too telling how Hollywood feels about aging in movies where we're treated to older actors and characters. For some reason we like to think there's something wrong with aging, with being experienced, with repetition and with consistency and while this aversion to predictability does produce dramatic action-oriented story telling, that's not what I want or expect from a movie about an older character. I look forward to older characters being treated with greater respect and creativity then simply making them grumpy, giving them a problem they've seen before and pitting them against women in all their glorious independence. Living people in the real world look forward to the freedom of being old and helping people do things without them because they've done enough not to deserve the peace of being remembered for who they still are in spite of their obvious display of having had stuff to do their entire lives.",

The movie is incredible to watch and holds up over time like all the Indy movies. As far as the story goes it is as good as any and Connery and Ford play off each other incredibly well. But with their chemistry comes the reason why Last Crusade falls short of The original Raiders movie, it is to light and unlike the first movie relies on the situations for the comedy and not the characters. Also the Indiana Jones character was by this time turned into to much of a good guy without flaws. One can not forget how a great character such as Marcus Brody was compromised for comedic purposes.My other major complaint being that Last Crusade doesn't have the incredible action sequence that knocks your socks off.In raiders we had the chase through the streets, and the truck chase, and in Doom we had the opening sequence and the mine cart ride. What did we have in Crusade? We had a tank sequence and a motorcycle chase neither would rank in my five Indy action sequences.

It definitely is not the best but I love the treasure that Indiana is searching for and the story is just written so well. Sean Connery really is so good as Indiana's father that you can actually see him being his father in real life. Just like the first 2 films in the franchise it has everything you have come to expect from an Indiana film. I also love that we get to see a small taste of our hero's childhood. It follows the exact same formula as the first 2 but that's what makes a successful franchise. Some of the old favorite characters return and join in on the adventure which was a refreshing change. With this film Spielberg and Lucas insured that they created a truly successful trilogy of films that could even rival Star Wars. I would go so far as to say that in some ways Indiana Jones is a stronger trilogy than the first Star Wars trilogy simply because with this film Indiana really does end on a strong note.,

It seems the writers wanted to recreate the magic of the first film, so again, Jones is chasing after a Biblical artifact and fighting Nazis. Gone is the silly, over the top plot of Temple of Doom. However, many of the scenes are boring. Jones spends too much time chasing Nazis around Europe instead of being in a tomb or temple, which is where the series shines. Too much time is also spent explaining the somewhat convoluted backstory. All we need to know is the Nazis are the bad guys. I don't care about the rest. Get on with the action already.",

502,26 December 2019,Kendich89,9, X marks the spot,"In IJTLC we're provided with a backstory of the famed archaeologist Indiana Jones. The film opens with a bunch of adolescent Boy Scouts horseback riding through the scorched rocky country of eastern Utah.
Two of boys decide on going cave-scouting (one of whom is young Mr Jones) and they happen upon a group of tomb raiders who dig up a golden cross purported to belong to the Spanish conquistador Coronado.
Young Indie steals the cross from the fumbling bunch and a spectacularly choreographed chase sequence ensues, involving a moving circus train full of jet-lagged animals.
Young Indie manages to escape the clutches of the bandits and takes refuge in his home where his father (played by Sean Connery) absentmindedly acknowledges his hectic arrival while remaining mostly absorbed by an ancient literature book.
This interlude gives us a perspective on Indie's integrity and morals present in his from an early age, particularly concerning artifacts and anything of historical significance.
The sheriff arrives and Indie hands over the cross only to realize a moment later that he'd been played. It must have been his first lesson of the workings of real life.",
503,24 March 2014,baldjeanandfriede,5, Seriously flawed,"This movie suffers from a serious flaw. It is bad enough to hear Nazis speak English with a horrible German accent, but hearing a Nazi speak German with the accent of a native English speaker is intolerable. The way Dr. Schneider pronounces ""Eins"" is a dead giveaway. The ""Ei"" in ""Eins"" is not the same as ""I"" in the English language. ""I"" is pronounced with a rounded mouth. The corners of the mouth have to be stretched to the left and right to pronounce the ""Ei"" in ""Eins"". I (Friederike) grew up bilingually; my parents are German but I lived in England for the first few years of my life and speak both languages without a foreign accent, so I know what I am talking about.",
504,26 May 2021,uolevivittu,10, Best Indiana Jones movie. Largely thanks to comedic brilliance by Connery & Ford,"This is quite simply the perfect adventure movie. Just 10/10. Never been topped, never probably will be topped.",
505,24 May 2003,Big_Oil,10, A spectacular return to form,"When the two greatest filmmakers in the world teamed up to create the best action movie of all time - Raiders of the Lost Ark, it seemed unlikely that they could duplicate their divinely-inspired work. After a miss with the entertaining yet forgettable Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade comes pretty close to doing just that.",
506,1 June 2003,petteri_hamalainen,10, Believable plot and locations truthful to reality.,Excellent conclusion to the trilogy. Sean Connery performs brilliantly as the father. Also Indys character is rather convincing. The plot is actually very believable and the locations truthful to reality. Recommended.,
507,5 June 2000,trut,10, Ford and Connery: A winning combination,"It's quite true.  They don't make movies like this anymore.  It would be impossible.  The combination of Sean Connery and Harrison Ford just worked. These are two very talented, established and expensive actors and they were at the time it was made, too.  Only George Lucas could afford this kind of talent, and perhaps it was the best way Lucasfilm have ever spent their money.  If only they could have remembered how to produce a good movie when they made the expensive but disappointing The Phantom Menace, recently. Perhaps it was just luck.  The chemistry between Connery and Ford was a jackpot.  It is a classic movie and it has been one of my favorites for years.",
508,5 May 2021,jmforsyth-33291,8, A Great Finale,"The finale of the original ""Indy"" trilogy delivers a fond farewell to an iconic character.",
509,10 April 2000,AdamPeabody,10, I've never voted 10 for a film. Ever.,"This is one of those remarkably few films that is both commercially successful as well as a cinematic WORK. Spielberg, who I typically have reservations about, truly outdoes himself in this film by directing Ford, and Connery in their best roles ever. Speaking from the perspective of a perpetual 007 fan, I have to give Connery his fair share here as an ACTOR. This is working in the business at its finest. Being around actors and crew members all the time, I have to appreciate what has been accomplished in this movie. Kudos to all involved...even to Ben Burtt for his foleyed rats. Only in my latest viewing did it occur to me that those aren't really rats squealing away but foley artists in a studio somewhere in Burbank. Congrats!",
510,14 November 1999,EdCurtis,9, Chemistry between Ford and Connery puts this film on top,"""Last Crusade"" is hands-down my favorite of the Indiana Jones films.  What makes this one tick isn't the action, but the relationship between Indiana and his dad, which has a healthy mixture of humor and seriousness.  You couldn't ask for a better Jones Sr. than Sean ""James Bond"" Connery. ",
511,20 February 2005,mydivinecomedy,10, Indiana Jones... still misunderstood,All these complaints about plot holes only serves to show how people don't understand what the movie IS. Indiana Jones was based on the serial action pics of the 40s and 50s. In that regard it is PERFECT because it isn't too overworked in the details. Those movies were pumped out at a terrifyingly fast rate and as such generally had a minimum of effort expended (if only due to time constraints).,
512,21 December 2013,tristandetwiler,10, That Man in the Hat is Back...,"This last installment in the Indiana Jones Trilogy is... eh, where the series should've ended. This great adventure is just as good, if not better than Raiders of the Lost Ark. This time, the creators bring in Indy's father, played by Sean Connery, which is how to movie gets it's heart. The best moments of this picture are all about the father and son bonding in the face a danger. The sequence in which they are tied up in the castle while it burns to the ground, is one of the most suspenseful yet hilarious scenes in a movie.",
