That's why I think I like this much. It's not afraid to shock and it's not afraid to make you think. Good people make some bad things. Bad people make some good things. People can change. I know this is a lot for this new world order where you are right 100% of the time or wrong 100% of the time, but this is what being human means.",/

It was surprisingly funny given its subject matter. But after thinking about it for a few days after watching it, I have to say a few words about the writing, because it seems everyone is raving about how ""Oscar worthy"" the writing here is, and at first glance, I thought so too.

11,28 December 2017,MongoLloyd,4, Is this a masterpiece?,"Pretty cool cast, and interesting premise muddied by oddities, implausibilities, and a juvenile sense of story. Is this a film set in a world where crazy stuff happens as a matter of course, or a normal every day world where crazy stuff happens every now and then? In this film, I see pretty normal people doing normal things and having normal things happen to them, so why is it the writer/director chose to litter what could have been a very good film with SO much bizarro bs? And with literally ZERO character development? ",4

And like most of the greatest she goes for characters who don't ask for sympathy. The truth is in her eyes, always. So, naturally, I followed her every inch of the way. She is surrounded by a fantastic group of actors. Woody Harrelson is just extraordinary but perhaps the biggest surprise is Sam Rockwell making his one eighty not just believable but very moving. Martin McDonagh's writing is the magic potion that keeps everything together and when I say everything I mean everything. Humor and horror as if it were practically the same thing. The dialogue is brilliant and Frances McDorman deserves the last paragraph. Her face is a wonder. Superb performance. Don't miss it.",9

15,10 January 2018,claudio_carvalho,7, Deceptive Ending Without a Conclusion,"""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is a great crime movie in an environment of grief, anger, remorse, racism, violence, sympathy and a sophisticated black-humor. The performances are top-notch and it is hard to point out only one or two names in the cast, indeed a constellation of stars. Maybe the performances of Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell may be highlighted since they are the lead. Unfortunatelly the deceptive ending without a conclusion throws cold water in this film. The redemption of Dixon finding the rapist killer would have given some hope to the story. But the author decided to keep a dark ending without conclusion. Claude Chabrol was a master in mystery films with open end; however his conclusion were subtle and ambiguous, giving the chance to the audience to discuss possibilities based on his or her interpretation of the storyline. But the conclusion of ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is indeed a cliffhanger usually used in TV series or films written for franchise or at least a sequence. My vote is seven.",3

17,16 February 2018,ramfat,4, The best way to express your grief is by committing multiple felonies.,"First, let's all just accept the premise that police beat up random black people for no reason whatsoever. Also, police are inept, because they can't find someone to arrest for the murder and rape of your daughter, even though there is zero forensic evidence. Next let's take a moment to reflect on the time you told your daughter ""I hope you get raped on the way too"". Now it's time to start lashing out at the world because you are angry. Start by committing 2 felonies against a dentist. It's also a good idea to go into a police station and tell them what horrible people they are. When your signs get set on fire, climb onto one of the burning signs and stand at the top of the flames. Next, fire-bomb a police station, because you are still mad, even though there is still no evidence or suspects. Finally, if you can't find the actual person who committed the crime, instead go murder a complete stranger on a hunch. This is all very profound and heart-wrenching...can't you tell by the music?",/

21,23 February 2018,Fella_shibby,10, Awesome film. Very entertaining inspite of the matter being serious n dark. The mamma's boy deserves an Oscar.,"Saw this in a theatre. Very entertaining film with relevant social issues. The film deserves best film Oscar n Rockwell best supporting actor.
The best part about this film is the character development and the awesome ensemble cast and their performances. 
Frances McDormands performance is solid but Sam Rockwell cannot be ignored n Woody Harrelson is always a treat to watch.
Another great aspect is the writing. McDonagh did a terrific job. He tackled the films serious dark material very well n made the film bearable to watch by adding enuff humor, unpredictability, tension n beautiful locations. The editing n cinematography is good too. This film was captivating n mesmerising n not at all slow as compared to most Oscar nominated films.

22,18 March 2018,SnoopyStyle,6, so many issues,"In the town of Ebbing, Missouri, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) rents three billboards on an isolated road to berate police chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) for his failure to find her daughter's killer. Willoughby is actually dying from cancer and the town ostracizes her. Dixon (Sam Rockwell) is a volatile racist deputy living with his overbearing mother.",_
23,29 August 2018,gbill-74877,6," Entertaining, but flawed","There is so much pent-up rage over the handling of rape, and police behavior in general, that I think Frances McDormand's character in this film really struck a chord with people. She's on a crusade for her daughter who was raped and killed, and yet no progress has been made in the investigation. She doesn't care who she offends, she won't be intimidated into silence, and she'll stand up for herself in some violent ways. In an interesting twist, the police chief (Woody Harrelson) has pancreatic cancer, so aside from being called out on his investigation, he's dealing with that. The scene McDormand and Harrelson have in an interrogation room, and a specific moment of that is easily the film's best. Harrelson provides a voice of wisdom in the film, and the three letters he pens are also quite touching. There is humor as well, in just how boneheaded one of the policemen (Sam Rockewell) is, and the gem of a moment when Peter Dinklage, otherwise largely wasted, utters the line ""Penelope said 'begets'?"", in a subtle burn of the 19-year-old now dating McDormand's ex-husband.",=

27,27 February 2018,Coralknight,2, A LOT to overlook,"OK, let's just forget all the plot-holes here; like the fact that two people sitting in front of a burning police station would not simply be ""free to be on their way"". Or like a police officer throwing another man out a window and being witnessed by the police chief would simply be asked to turn in his badge and gun. Or that a woman who has an apparent blood-lust, capable of fire-bombing a building and watching a man on fire simply crawl out while doing nothing would let another strange man threaten her, break her items, then just let him walk away without reporting it. Yes...let's forget these and the MANY other plot holes in this entire mess...and what are we left with? Just a sad, bitter sermon on how all men are just plain evil if left to their own devices...yet white women must always get a pass in life (just because...don't ask why or you're a misogynist!)

But it's so well made that it never becomes overbearing or depressing to sit through. In fact it's interesting, moving and entertaining throughout. The script must have been really tight, the writing is some of the best I have seen in recent years and acting is superb. Everyone brings their best(or close to) in this, but Frances McDormand steals the show with an amazing performance. If she doesn't win best female actor then something is really wrong..

33,30 December 2017,jtindahouse,10, How can one film be so perfect in so many ways?,"Last year I had the unfortunate duty of giving the eventual Best Picture winner at the Academy Awards a negative review. 'Moonlight' was not a movie that sat well with me. Now this is a very early call on my part but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm writing the review for the 2018 winner as we speak, and I can assure you it's not going to be a negative review this time around. 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is the finest film I have watched in a long time. How a film that can break your heart so effortlessly can also manage to be so damn funny and charming at the same time is simply beyond me. It shouldn't be possible. However writer/director Martin McDonagh proves that it can indeed be done.",
34,17 February 2018,tedd0093,9, Drama and comedy at the highest level,"I went to see this movie because I hadn't seen any trailers to it. It's something I do because trailers are unreliable and spoiling, but also this case was based around the sheer number of good reviews. I can't even describe how surprised i was when i started to invest in the drama, and I really got my money worth when seeing it in the theaters. This is a movie that grips you good from the start, and holds the tension of the backstory right up until the end. The characters are phonemically written, and the actors did a hell-of-a-good job portraying them. This is a movie that could have been written off with a ""strong protagonist""-cinda-story, but unfolds to a much more deep and philosophical tone. To be honest! not much happens in this film, but because of the powerfull characters within - every little detail about their lives, becomes of great importance throughout. I can say without a doubt, that this is my favourite movie of the year (2017...Ofc.)",

While it is slowly paced and dialogue heavy, the film never manages to get boring, I cared and was intrigued by these characters from beginning to end, wanting to see them develop. I expected it to be a lot more thrilling, it certainly moves a lot slower than Martin McDonagh's previous films, but it did not bother me one bit, the pace actually adds to the suspense and the mundanity of these people's lives.

38,3 December 2017,jbarrow-27014,6, Seriously overpraised,"The actors are superb, but the script fails in several ways. My immediate reaction, seeing the opening shots, was that this was not Missouri. I guessed it to be the southern Appalachians (where I have spent a lot of time), and so it was. The characters did not behave or speak the way real Southerners speak or behave. Martin McDonagh has written his fantasy of what he thinks Southerners are like. He got it wrong. He works in film sort of the way D. Trump works in politics--he shocks, he amuses, he appeals to our base instincts. But he doesn't tell a coherent story. ",

42,2 November 2017,kjproulx,10, One Of The Best Films Of The Year,"It goes without saying that dark comedy is very difficult to accomplish. I would almost say it's harder to pull off than regular comedy because you need to be able to keep people invested in the dramatic aspect of the film, while still keeping them laughing throughout the majority of the duration. Director Martin McDonagh has matured as a filmmaker over the years, starting off with In Bruges, which was pretty much a flat-out comedy, to Seven Psychopaths, which placed him a little further into the spotlight, but I must admit that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is not only his best film to date, but also one of the best films I've received the pleasure of witnessing all year. From laughter to genuine tension and heart, this is a film that's pretty much perfect all around. Here is why I can recommend this film to everyone.",

The fact that it has a more real feel, and that it disappoints expectations of happy endings, is a sign of frustration in the experience available to the common viewer. However, for their target audience, they are the best films, after all, writing a story that balances the happy and sad so well is something worthy of applause. And that's what Three Billboards for a Murder proposes, and brilliantly does.",
44,5 March 2018,davispittman,10, Wow! That was a great film!,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017) really is a fantastic film, definitely deserved its Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards. They just got everything right with this one! A film of this type is very difficult to make. The main reason it's so tough, is because yes it's pretty dark due to the subject matter, but it also has some comedy sprinkled in occasionally. You have to make sure that the comedy sprinkled in does not make the subject out to be a joke, or that it doesn't diminish it in any way. Luckily, this one was done in a very smart fashion. When there is comedy, it is very funny, but when it's time to be serious and focus on the darker aspects, no on is laughing. That's how you pull off a film like this successfully. The plot surrounds Mildred, played by Frances McDormand. She rents three billboards just outside of Ebbing, where she lives. Those billboards have messages on them that go after the local police department, she is doing this because her daughter was raped and murdered and she doesn't think the cops are doing anything about it. After she does this, there is a lot of backlash and there are consequences that people suffer. I won't give away any spoilers, but let's just say that you won't be taking your eyes off the screen. Part of the reason for that is because of the cast this film boasts. McDormand gives a fabulous performance here, I mean I was blown away by her raw talent that was displayed here. So glad she took home the Oscar for this powerhouse performance. Woody Harrelson is good here too, his character isn't quite as big as McDormand and Sam Rockwell's, but he still did a good job. Sam Rockwell is a very talented actor and he proved that talent here with his portrayal of the very complicated, messy character that he plays. I loved every cast member and what they brought to the film. The writing is witty, clever, and above all, intelligent. I 100% recommend this film.",
45,9 January 2018,nehpetstephen,2, Seriously?

So often, the movie that wins Best Picture and sweeps the other categories is something that I consider overrated or cheesy or simply not as good as some of the other movies I enjoyed from that year. In all of those cases, I can at least put aside my frustration and disappointment and understand what it is about the movie that's connecting with other people, or I can appreciate why it was entertaining or moving to audiences even if it wasn't quite my thing. In all the years I've been paying attention to movies, not once has a movie like this come along--a critical darling, an awards frontrunner, a box office smash, and an IMDb user hit that I find to be thoroughly awful nearly to the point of offensiveness.

Martin McDonaugh may be mistaken too quickly as having made a Coen brothers film - Frances McDormand being there doesn't help assuage that argument - yet through In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths he's shown his acidic, no bullish*t, I see clichés for what they are and raise you a subversion original voice in writing and an assured hand in direction. He also casts his movies like nobody's business and from McDormand down to Sam Rockwell and Sam Rockwell's mom to the actress as Angela Hayes having one scene, he has everyone with fresh, Thanksgiving-buffet-plate meat to chew on.

Frances McDormands character at first comes across as just being a broken woman, but a flashback scene shows that her character was never a pleasant person. Her ex-husband likes to poke fun at the towns little person like he's still in junior high. Sam Rockwells character is the worst. He tortures a black kid, punches a young lady in the face, throws a city clerk out a two-story window for no reason at all. But yet, the writers thought that his character needed a redemption angle.

52,26 February 2018,PetarNeo,10, It will make you explore deepest thoughts,"There are always new ways of exploring crime stories and Three billboards goes in such directions that you could probably never imagine. Story of Three billboards explores human nature as it finds itself trapped in mystery and missing answers, which will show us how far individuals are capable of going to get peace and satisfaction over pain and grief. If you stop asking yourself and keep pushing toward better and healthier state of mind without any satisfaction you will face how you go mad and so Martin McDonagh creates story in such fashion that main character is strongest person and is capable of provoking and harming everybody that doesn't want to help her (Mildred). Mildred (Frances McDormand) is the mother that seeks answers and keeps pushing everybody around her as far it is possible and with doing so (Frances) gives a powerful performance of strong women that will melt and destroy them all if they try to defy her. Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and Dixon (Sam Rockwell) are two officers that are being influenced most by actions of Mildred and it was pretty horrifying to see how they will cope with such pressure. Sam Rockwell is giving us one of the most honest performances as he turns completely from inside out. Martin McDonagh is an absolute master in creating difficult situations that can also be explored in his previous movies such as 'In Bruges' and 'Seven Psychopaths' and continues to write and whole story that will suck you in as easy as you drink your drink at movie theatre while looking Three Billboards and wonder how actually good is he as movie maker. If you love crime drama genre you will absolutely fall in love with this one and it is easily one of the best movie this year because it will make you think about everything that has happened and try to evaluate how is it to deal with all of it which also gives a huge philosophical characteristics. 4/4",

So, what we seem to get is a pile of jokes, mainly racist and sexist, about older guys and their bimbos or about a dwarf. Frances McDormand's performance, like that of Harrelson is too one note to be considered great. Grating maybe. Oh and since when has a woman kicking schoolgirls in the crotch been considered funny?

Violence creates violence, only forgiveness or the ability to leave things go can stop the circle: it is absolutely true, however we already know it.

67,6 January 2018,The-Sarkologist,8, The Human Side of the Small Town,"I'm not really all that sure why I went and saw this film, but from the trailers it sounded interesting, and also somewhat dark, and funny, at the same time (a black comedy if you will). The first thing that I should mention is that I haven't seen a film like this for a while, where the ending is incredibly ambiguous (as it should be), and that it doesn't follow the average Hollywood cookie cutter format. Okay, while I'm not as much into independent films as I used to be, seeing something that is a little different once in a while does break the monotony of what happens to be a steadily degrading trend in modern movies.
 The film is about a mother who lost her daughter when she was raped and murdered on her way home. This is small town America in the deep south, so you could say that the average educational level of most people here is not very high, and it certain shows it. In fact, until another police officer arrives from out of town, you could say that the average intelligence of this place is not incredibly high. However, this isn't a film where we end up laughing at 'stupid' people because we happen to be intellectual snobs, but rather a film that takes us on a journey through their lives and discover that even though they may be nothing like us educated city dwellers, they are still humans with hurts and fears just like us.
 Frustrated as the fact that the police are doing very little to progress the case, our protagonist, Mildred, has an idea - she rents three billboards on the outskirts of the town along a stretch of road that basically only she uses. She then pastes some simple messages challenging the police as to why they haven't caught anybody yet. This, not surprisingly, causes a bit of a stir in the town, and in a way it seems that she is the only person who is frustrated by the lack of action, or convictions, because the town seems to be siding with the police. Well, once again not surprising considering the chief is not only well respected, but also dying of cancer.
 This film touches on few ideas, including the limits of police power and the desire of a victim or their relatives wanting to see justice down. As the police chief says: sometimes it is just impossible to find the culprit, and they may go for years not knowing anything until somebody over hears a braggart in a diner and the culprit is suddenly arrested. In a way this shows the dichotomy of humans, in that on one hand they want protections against police abusing their power, but for the police to have unlimited power when they become the victim. As long as it is somebody else that is being chased then that is okay.
 The other thing that struck me is the human element of the film. Sure, this is set in a very conservative part of the United States, a place where outsiders and people of colour are still treated with suspicion. Yet what we are struck with is the human side of these people, how they love and cry, how they hurt, and fight against each other. It is easy for us to simply write of this section of society as a bunch of idiots who have no idea about the problems that the world is facing, yet they are still human. In a way this film is attempting to bridge that gap between the left and the right, the intellectuals and the average Republican voter. It is easy for us to look down on them, and we certainly do, making accusations such as them voting against their own interests, and destroying the American state. Yet they are people, and it is easy for us to forget their humanity.
 One thing that stands out is their ability to forgive, and this is something that many of us on the left really don't know how do to. There are events in this film that would raise the ire of many, and leave to a long lasting split in friendships, yet it seems that the one thing that they seek is to mend those friendships. Somebody gets thrown out of a window in a fit on anger, yet the victim forgives the person who throws him out of the window, even though no apology was offered. In a way there is too much hate in this world, and not enough forgiveness. In one sense, by reaching out, offering a hand of friendship, and showing somebody that we forgive we can start to heal some of those wounds, and in turn seek a way forward.",

As Wesley Morris pointed out in the NYT a while back, there's nothing ""real"" about Ebbing. At all. It is an ultra-unrealistic blend of Hollywood's many non-existent US small towns.

73,15 February 2018,JoshuaMooreBE,9, Tense and unpredictable in every way.,"This movie I went into almost blind, but I came out of the theater with it probably being my favorite film in the last year. This film is so smart at being able to keep you at the edge of your seat from simple things that they plug into the film. Heartbreaking and tense situations in the first half of the film come back in some shape or form that leave you questioning what is going to happen. There was genuinely no predicting what the characters were going to do and how they would react to certain events. This unpredictability doesn't just apply to situations, but possibly more notable in character arcs. Without giving to much away, there is a character in this film that does everything possible for you to hate them in the first half, and by the end of the film you are rooting for said character. There's times where the characters that you cared for are becoming real and dis-likable in certain scenes, but to the point of more so being genuinely worried about how their choices will affect them.",
74,24 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,9," Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri shows that a serious subject and dark humour make for a good combination.","This film really did blow me away, I mean I knew it was going to be good but...not that good! McDonaugh had my undivided attention immediately, and he didn't let me go. Not once. That in itself, is a damn achievement. The mother of a daughter who was raped and murdered rents three billboards as a way of getting the police's attention to find the killer. Sounds like it should be boring right? So you bring in the writer and director of 'In Bruges' and 'Seven Psychopaths' to mix things up abit. What he has managed to conjure up is the perfect equilibrium of depressing real life situations with dark humour in order to create a story about grief. You may not necessarily agree with Mildred's methods yet it evokes sympathy, you empathise with her. Her cold harsh exterior disguises the sadness and sorrow within. When I say harsh, I mean she is savage. Dropping F-Bombs more frequently than a B-2 Stealth, she obliterates anyone in Ebbing who gets in her way...and it is so satisfying to watch. I don't condone large usage of profanity in a script, but when it's put to ingenious use it somehow brings a smile to my face. ""Yeahhh, kick them in the crotch!"". It's a strange trait that actually complements McDormand's portrayal, and wow did she blow my mind. She was devastatingly outstanding to which I'm sure she will win many awards. Her serious demeanour just added to the hilarity of this dark comedy. Rockwell was hilarious as the local idiot officer and also deserves recognition. Harrelson provides some much needed heart and emotion as the chief of police. McDonaugh's best directing effort thus far. The musical score was well suited to the rustic town of Ebbing. I do think the ending could've been cut short by about 5 or 10 minutes, and very occasionally the pacing dips. Very minuscule criticisms for a near perfect film which I'm sure will be even more enjoyable after a repeat viewing. I can smell all the awards from here...",

Woody Harrelson is extremely likeable throughout the film in one of his most engaging roles to date and Sam Rockwell completely transforms into a racist, brutal and incredibly stupid cop nailing both the humour and unexpected heart behind the character.

Noticing three derelict billboards on a largely unused stretch of road just out of town, she rents them and puts up a personal challenge to local police chief Woody Harrelson. The police department, especially thuggish cop Sam Rockwell, are very unhappy about this turn of events. The town is divided. Harrelson is a popular man, but the department has a history of mistreating the town's less fortunate citizens (particularly the African American population), so many folks like seeing them called to task. This sets up what seems to be a very straightforward ""little guy vs authority"" story, but McDonagh has a more morally complex story in mind. Harrelson is a dying man, suffering from terminal cancer, and his explanation of why the case has gone nowhere seems quite reasonable. McDormand is suffering from understandable grief, but you learn that some of the grief might stem from a feeling of personal responsibility for the tragedy. Good characters do some really bad things. Bad characters commit horrifically violent actions, but then suffer from violence due to heroically self-sacrificing acts. Besides being a serious meditation on grief and revenge, it's also very darkly comic.",
85,18 February 2018,magnuslhad,8, mixed bag,"Three Billboards is an immensely enjoyable viewing experience. The characters are carnivalesque, outrageous and troubling in one turn, heroic and inspiring at the next. McDonagh quite deliberately does not let you find a moral centre in his tale. There is a 'save the cat' moment very early in the film, a character helping an insect rather than crushing it, that is so mechanical that I flinched. Shame on me for falling so easily into McDonagh's trap. The plot zig-zags and leaves you breathless trying to process each new piece of information. The dialogue crackles with delicious insults. I laughed hard, and often. And then I cried. And winced. And laughed again. There is one scene of quite shocking violence. The performances have been lauded, and rightly so, as Frances McDormand, Caleb Landry Jones, Sam Rockwell , and Woody Harrelson bump and smack against each other tied to the roller-coaster plot. Peter Dinklage gets the chance to show his range. But while the praise for the acting is merited, the praise for the screenplay is more problematic. A huge coincidence in the final 20 minutes sets off a chain of events that leads to a redemption that is unearned, and a reconciliation that seems implausible. ""Love,"" implores a missive from one character to another, and the moral turn that character takes on that one command is too abrupt and too unequivocal. It also asks for forgiveness of acts already witnessed, and implied, that are far too egregious to be forgotten. A flawed film then, but perhaps all the more interesting for those flaws.

Of course Frances McDormand, did a good job as a violent mother. But Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson just did a nice job. Martin McDonagh is trying to impress the audience with fierce mannerisms, showing violence only by showing, and as a result he is trying to impress the male audience (audience is only interested in violence, instead of seeing a good story). In other words, the director was more interesting to create a movie full of violence, instead of creating a real drama with real characters and real and interesting conflicts, and an interesting film to see.",

Basically, Mildred, decides to put up billboards criticizing the work done by the police in her daughter's murder. In a flash back, we see she carries a lot of guilt because of the last conversation she had with her daughter, but that part is never expanded upon. So of course, people in town get on her back, because the sheriff, Willoughby, is well liked and dying of cancer. She gets a lot of threats and her son gets picked on, but she won't take down the billboards. One side plot which I didn't get why it was thrown in, was Willoughby gives his family a special day, then kills himself. I don't get why that was thrown in. Also, Dixon, one of the ""bad"" officers but depicted with a heart of gold at the end, beats up the advertising guy, and doesn't go to jail. Instead, he nearly dies at the police station when Mildred sets it on fire. Only to team up with her at the end for vigilante justice. So out of character. So she just leaves her only child left to go hunt someone down; you'd think her son would be her number one priority.

Good movies perform magic, while ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" performs a street-hustle trick with a loaded deck of cards. The film drops names of important and timely issues and simply glosses over them, trading substance for melodramatic violence, constant foul language, characters that are mostly caricatures, and a story/script with close to zero continuity and coherence. The film is billed as a dark comedy, but it really is a dark nightmare of a film. Honestly, I've read comic books with a more coherent storyline. There are various incidents of assault, arson, and attempted murder AND not only is no one ever held responsible, but the incidents are forgotten five minutes later in the film!

This is a comical drama-or, dramatic comedy-that has good actors and a good story but a bad ending that leaves you hanging. Frances plays a woman that had a daughter that was found raped and murdered and then set on fire. She doesn't think the police chief, Woody, has done his job in finding the killer responsible. Frances decides to put a message on three billboards stating her feelings. Nothing slanderous or untrue. She just poses the question of why Woody has not caught the killer, yet. Abbie plays Woody's wife and Sam is a racist deputy that lives at home with his mother. Almost all of the characters are complex, and will throw you a curve-no one is all good or all bad. Even Frances does things that are questionable and lies about things. If the ending were better, I would have given it a higher rating.

Pitch black comedy/drama with McDormand (in an Oscar calibre turn) as an unapologetically strident, small-town woman seeking justice by buying advertising space to shame the local constable (Harrleson in a solid, low-key turn) for not solving the rape/murder of her daughter, fanning the fires for anger in the community and familial discord. Rockwell (also award worthy) is a hoot as a bigoted, imbecile cop on the force who is more than he appears and that could equally apply to the riotously profane and surprisingly poignant film by writer/director Martin McDonagh who shows in more ways than one that still waters run deep.

Very Coen-esque, and not just in that it stars Frances McDormand, who's appeared in half a dozen of their films and is actually married to one of the brothers. Most notable is the way director/screenwriter Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) gets us familiar with dozens of rounded, colorful characters, fleshes them out and makes us care about how their paths intertwine. Or, in most cases, how they collide, break apart and ricochet into the next unsuspecting object. This really gets going in the second act, when a core character makes a profound decision that results in a solid hour of nonstop chain reactions. But it's not all dark gristle and angry monologues. Often, it works as an effective black comedy, which I realize is a tough thing to recognize after admitting it's about a rape investigation. Such tension-breakers are crucial, though, to keep us from getting too bogged down in the solemnity of it all, and to maintain a sense of momentum. Wonderfully shot, with plenty of time dedicated to exploring the beat-up small town at the center of all the drama, it's also expertly paced, brilliantly acted and continuously surprising.

Nonetheless it didn't squander my anticipation for his next filmmaking adventure; Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which is getting a hell of a lot of Awards attention, and that couldn't make me happier. Three Billboards is quintessential McDonagh; dark, hilarious, emotional, shocking, quotable, filled to the brim with characters that ooze depth and development.

I won't lie, it had a story line that I thought would have a few twists throughout and I found myself saying, it was him or he knows who its and is protecting them. I was wrong. Even when Dixon (Sam Rockwell) obtained the DNA from the man in the bar I thought there would be some kind of conclusion from that. Again, I was wrong.
Other reviews have stated how did Dixon get away with beating up the advertising guy or how did Mildred get to throw fire bombs at the police station and get away with it because a midget who fancied her said she was with him (This character had nothing else to do with the film and was not really given any role in the film other than to be mocked in the restaurant scene). Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) shoots himself and leaves letters that don't really serve any purpose to the film and his wife (Abbie Cornish) is so wooden and was that supposed to be an american accent as her native Australian came shining through.The ending showed two people who no-one but a sociopath could relate to going off to possibly kill someone who had committed no crime. I have to confess I did zone out for about 15 minutes but I doubt I missed anything note worthy to the sub standard plot. I'm at loss as to why it was labelled a dark comedy - I couldn't find anything remotely funny in this film. If you want a lesson in black comedy watch 'An American Werewolf in London'.

The cops are racists, black people are oppressed, little people are demeaned, innocent people are beaten without consequence and another is arrested and jailed for two joints - in 2017, while arson and wife beating are winked at by seemingly oblivious yokels. All of this is seemingly in service to director McDonagh's seeming belief that small-town America is most clearly defined by its defects and those defects are rampant pathologies.

You won't see anything more pretentious than the shots and color grading of Three Billboards all year. It's a lot of slow pans, hand-held, and shots of billboards that has no significant meaning. The lighting is also very unnatural too. There is a super pretentious deer scene that supposedly represents incarnation? What does that symbolic metaphor supposed to represent if her daughter is dead? UGGHHHHH. The music is absolutely horrible. It's this typical Coen Brothers esque music. Actually the entire film feels like a Coen Brothers rip off. There is also this obnoxious Southern music that will fill your mind with toxic. The characters and the story represents a Southern country. Another movie glorifying these obnoxious conservative Trump tards. The more we support these vagrant trash, the more the world will suck. Three Billboards is one of those cynical depressing movies that doesn't help anyone.

SHE ENDS UP GOING AFTER A RAPIST THAT ISN'T HER RAPIST, SO WHY DIDN'T SHE DO THAT WITH HER RAPIST IN THE FIRST PLACE? Oh yeah, to even add more heat to that ending. Apparently Sam Rockwell knows where that rapist lives just by getting his car plate number and the blood from him beating him? He's not a cop anymore, so why is he able to get confidential information that he shouldn't have access to? OKKAAAAYYY that makes no sense. Sam Rockwell becomes from a racist cop to good cop for some reason because he read a letter from his dead chief. Why? He despised his chief in the first half, so that right there is a plot hole. The editing is absolutely poor. Sam Rockwell decides to go beat up redhead boy funding the billboards after his chief kills himself cause I guess he think those billboards killed his chief? We never saw any of that anger so it is just came left field without reasoning. The chief killing himself also makes no sense. There was absolutely 0 development that he was struggling with cancer. Just one cough of blood here and there and some dark jokes about cancer. The movie failed to deliver that aspect and so him killing himself after making sex jokes with his wife made no sense. Here is where the movie gets even more messy. The town blames the billboards for what caused his death, but before that happened. Frances McDormand says to Woody that everyone knows he had cancer. SOOOOO WOULDN'T HIS STRUGGLE WITH CANCER BE THE REASON WHY HE KILLED HIMSELF? WOULD THAT BE A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION AND NOT THE BILLBOARDS? Way to contradict yourself director/writer. This film is full of contradictions like these. The movie itself overall doesn't work well as a dark dramedy. The comedy is not funny and repetitive. It's a lot of derogatory jokes and ""oh that's from a book, oh that's from a movie."" Those ships have sailed long ago. There is nothing original about this film at all. Anyways, this movie gets a 0/10.",

I can't even fully describe to you, dear movie goer, where this movie is flawed. First of all, these characters in real life wouldn't talk like this. The vast majority of middle America doesn't curse this much in regular every day life. There isn't a lot of ppl that live in small town USA that walk around dropping a GD and an F in casual conversation at the dinner table talking to a priest, at the dentist office, sitting on a swing talking to a cop dying of cancer. That was the first major problem I have with the story. Like seriously WTF? The characters have no authenticity to them. And in a movie where character development is key, I found myself struggling for resolve. I mean the woman's daughter was raped and murdered for goodness sake. So that's major issue if you can't find something else in this woman's life to identify with. Furthermore, I can't help but wonder if making this a fictitious town was intentional or if the director actually wanted to use the town that they filmed in but city officials vetoed that once they heard the dialogue.

166,23 May 2018,leonblackwood,8," An enjoyable, unique movie!","Review:
Every now and again, a low budget movie comes along that exceeds expectation, which this movie certainly did. I personally found it entertaining throughout, and the performances from McDormand, Rockwell and Harrelson were brilliant. The storyline was also well put together but I was slightly disappointed with the ending. Although the subject matter was quite serious, the witty script made it a joy to watch, in a black comedy type of way, and it really does prove that you don't have to have a huge budget to make an entertaining movie. Anyway, the movie is about a mother, Mildred (Frances McDormand) who has become a recluse after her daughter is brutally murdered. After waiting 7 months for the police to come up with some results, she decides to take matters into her own hands by putting ""RAPED WHILE DYING"", ""STILL NO ARRESTS"" and ""HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY?"" on three billboards, hence the title. The billboards upset a lot of people in her small town, including Chief Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), and officer Jason Dixon who is a racist and a violent alcoholic. As Bill was unable to solve the case, he is pushed to investigate the murder again, after the billboards cause a huge impact in the town. Whilst suffering with pancreatic cancer, Bill decides to take his own life after finding out that the cancer has progressed, which leaves Mildred with no answers about her daughter. After another violent event, Jason is sacked from the police but he decides to look into the murder after reading a note that Bill left him before he committed suicide. Out of frustration, Mildred decides to burn down the police station, not knowing that Jason is inside but he manages to escape with severe burns around his body. Whilst in a bar, Jason hears a man bragging to his friend about being with a girl around the time Mildred's daughter was killed, so he gets into a fight with him to try and get his DNA. After finding out that the DNA didn't match, Mildred is left with no leads but she is still determined to find out what happened to her daughter, even though everyone is telling her to drop it. Frances McDormand was perfect for her role, along with Sam Rockwell who was funny throughout. The cinematography was also perfect for the movie and the various cameos were great additions to this unique movie. It could have easily been a depressing, downbeat film because of it's emotional backdrop, which is why I was surprised with the outcome. Because of the amount of awards that this movie received, I hope that other directors follow suit, especially in this day and age of loads of sequels and remakes. A great watch!",

My favorite is when the 3 billboards were set afire, but then only the paper was burned and the rickety old rotted-wood frames remained in great shape.
I get that love and desperation make a mother do crazy things, but drilling into a doctor, kicking children in the crotch, firebombing a police station four times, etc., was simply too far-fetched.
But my favorite peeve is with Woody. The loving father. He commits suicide, so his family will now get Zero life insurance.

The big problem is it tries to hard to be quirky, offbeat and irreverent, but at the same time attempts to wedge some pathos in here and there to balance it out. It just... fails. One problem is-- and curse me for saying this-- the movie is too short. It's as if there was a time limit on character development-- make a few comments and now it's up to you to see the big picture. Call a man a racist, and you're given the job of applying this assumption to everything a character does stems from this. Give a man cancer, and now you're job is to apply sympathy to his actions. An extra half hour would give both the director and the audience room to come to a better understanding of what lurks beneath, what drives the character's behavior. I'm trying to avoid a spoiler, but the last conversation Mildred has with her daughter is a perfect summation of what is really lacking in this movie. If you see it-- which I'm not saying you shouldn't-- you'll know exactly what I mean. I'd wait for the post-theater release.",

It's also a representation of our time as you can see those billboards as tweets too, tweets that made the whole community talking about the case and at the same time taking action. A typical image of social media's era with #metoo hashtags and many more...

For a movie like this it has a ton of laughs on the way which is why I say genre bending. Her plan worked to and extent in that it brings the case to the forefront but it has a ton of unforeseen ramifications. The chief actually has cancer and winds up killing himself (although he wrote a note saying it wasn't because of her billboards). This inspired a horrible cop in the unit (I think Sam Rockwell) to throw a guy who put the billboards up out of a two story window which causes him to lose his job. You'd think he'd get an assault charge here as well but there's a lot of things like that you have to just overlook in this movie. For whatever reason the same cop that did that also got a note from the chief which inspired him to be a good cop and try to find the killer.

I can safely say I have never before seen a film about a billboard dispute in a small town. Really, this is a film about a small town where everyone knows everybody, and everything about their business; the subtle character development and relationships changes are more important than the events that happen. It's also the characters that give this town such a rich feeling. The public's perception of Mildred also becomes a character (just like how mob mentality becomes a character in Fritz Lang's ""M""); we get glimpses of how the town feels from her interactions with her friend Denise (Amanda Warren, ""Mother!""), with her son (Lucas Hedges, ""Ben is Back""), the town midget (Peter Dinklage, ""Living in Oblivion"") and even Willoughby's wife Anne (Abbie Cornish, ""Sucker Punch""). Building up this town with its diverse populous gives us a town that feels wholly unique, and while not all the characters are given enough room to grow, I would say probably 90% of the characters in this film show some sort of growth over the course of this film. That, in my opinion, is quite impressive; to establish an entire town and, without going completely off the rails, change every character in that town in some way.",

And I hoped to like the film.,"I rarely go to the movies anymore but the film's location, the hype and Frances McDormand brought me out. I was ultimately disappointed with the experience. It seemed that the screenplay's conceit - the three billboards - was seen as such a good idea and selling point that the writer/director, Martin McDonagh, couldn't resist it even though it was beyond him to make anything coherent or believable around it. Moreover, he saw the location of small town Missouri as an opportunity to satisfy the world's base expectation of racism, violence and small-mindedness without the slightest intention or perhaps ability to explore them. McDonagh cut and pasted disparate scenes together in what was to add up to a black comedy and drama but the danger of going for art is that, when you miss, you get irksome, unentertaining, unconvincing dross. Films like ""Fargo"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Good Fellas"" and even ""Apocalypse Now"" are examples of how a roller coaster, collage screenplay can work but it takes skill to make it a unified satisfying whole. 
 
What went wrong? Screenwriting. Some of the dialogue was clichéd and amateurish. Many of the jokes were telegraphed and some of the emotional outpourings hollow. Characters. Whilst the ""head"" of the film McDormand, Harrelson and Rockwell did well, the gut of the film's cast were given nothing to work with and became pieces of cardboard. For example, how did an English rose (Yes, I know Abbie Cornish is Australian but she seems to effect a British accent) with an education in literature meet and marry a sheriff from small town Missouri? It can happen but there is no rhyme or reason for it within the context of the film. Moreover, some of the actions were uncharacteristic of the established characters. How does a mother and responsible loving father who is a chief of police leave their two little girls fishing by a lake surrounded by wilderness in order to have sex in the woods? The wife's praise of her husband's ""cock"" on their return home seemed gratuitous and phoney. The aftermath of making love with your dying husband was never so lacking in tenderness or affection. If you want sweetness without too much sugar in a black comedy look at the final scene in ""Fargo"". With a bit more imagination, McDonagh could surely have written a more touching family scene to symbolize a perfect last day for the sheriff prior to shooting himself. The suicide scene itself was apparently supposed to shock us with its suddenness but it seemed to me be just another obvious and convenient plot point. The letter of explanation by Chief of Police Willoughby for his suicide was utterly unconvincing too. And not to be too facetious or insensitive but I hope to look as well as Woody did and to be able to have sex right up to my end too! You may accuse me of being picky but, for the sake of brevity, I am only pointing out a few of the many cats that barked in this film. Smash up an advertising business, savagely beat up its editor and throw him out a window and brutally assault a female assistant but all that happens to you is you lose your job as a cop! I also found the punch in the face for the nice girl utterly gratuitous, cheap and nasty. Was it not established that Dixon was violently angry by what he did to ""Red""? No restraint and definitely no imagination by the writer/director. ",

213,3 March 2018,Boristhemoggy,7," Fabulous film, with some terrible moments.","I've not rated this film s high as some because I think there's some major flaws in it. The acting from McDormand is fabulous, possibly her best since Fargo. Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell pull out all the stops.
Clarke Peters sadly is like a blast from an 80's TV cop movie but that's not bad, it's just out of place slightly. 
However what really put me off was Abbie Cornish. She's a long way away from being a good actress let alone a great one, and to match her youth with Woody's when he is more than 20 years her senior harks back to bad old days of old men matched with young women. It was unnecessary and if they wanted glamour they could have easily cast someone like Michelle Pfeiffer. 
I didn't know she was in the film so when I saw her and the character she was playing it was very out of place. 
Then we get to a uniquely moving and romantic piece in the film where Woody's character has made love to her for the last time as he has terminal cancer. Reliving that moment Cornish's character as his wife says ""Thanks for that wonderful fuck."" 
WHAT??? One of the most poignant moments in the film and they reduce it to a fuck??? She then goes on to say how beautiful his cock is!
Utterly ruined the moment for me and degraded what is otherwise a fabulous, tremendous movie. What were the editors thinking!?",
214,28 October 2017,JustCuriosity,9, A Great Dark Comedy that Echos the Style of the Coen Brothers,"I had the pleasure of seeing the local premiere of Three Billboard outside of Ebbing, Missouri tonight at the Paramount Theater as part of Austin Film Festival. The film's style and humor is reminiscent of some of the better early Coen Brothers films (Blood Simple, Fargo, and Raising Arizona). The writer/director has basically stolen their style. Basically, a story that on paper is very dark and serious played with characters that are essentially humorous for dark comedic effect. The presence of Francis McDormand more-or- less completes the linkage. (She may well earn another Oscar nomination.) The film is deeply disturbing built around a mother's quest for justice after her daughter's violent death, themes of death and dying, police incompetence and brutality, and hints of racism and spousal abuse. At the same time, it can be hysterically funny and absurd. You want to laugh during one scene and cry during the next. The dis-functionality of just about every character is somehow both disturbing and hilarious. I think like the Coen Brothers, writer/director Martin McDonagh want you to take the issues raised seriously, but perhaps not to take ourselves too seriously. Overall, the acting and directing by a stellar cast is first-rate. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates this sort of dark comedy.",
215,3 June 2018,Hitchcoc,8, Too Far Out!,"I'm giving this a decent grade because it kept my attention from beginning to end. The thing one shouldn't do is to think too much. McDormand's character actually gets away with murder (not in the literal sense). She does things to people, especially those who had nothing to be ashamed of, that are beyond the pale. I appreciated that Woody Harrelson's sheriff is not unsympathetic. He is a pretty good guy. He tried to solve the case, but he is right when it comes to finding no clues. By the way, is anyone reading this growing a little tired of the ""F"" word being used in every other syllable of speech. The cops, townspeople, McDormand, on and on, can't say three words without dropping one of these. Is no effort made to create realistic speech among characters? Almost every police movie or movie with tough guys bends over backward to throw as much profanity around. I'm no prude, but I believe most people go through their days without this heavy artillery. I went to a supermarket yesterday, filled with all kinds of people, and didn't hear the ""F"" word once. Outside of that, if one accepts the premise of this film, it's tragic to watch this woman in her state of rage and guilt. She is a victim, but has no qualms about inflicting venom on others, including children. The police are ineffectual and one, Dixon, is a caricature. He is a great caricature, but so over the top, it's hard to imagine someone like him existing.",

I really loved Breathe and Wild River, but this was not only riveting in its development and surprising in its plot twists, but just fascinating to watch. The plot is crafted like an intricate puzzle that slowly spins out as the characters interact and react in completely unpredictable ways. The only thing I did NOT like about it is the ending, because I felt it not only left the audience hanging in the middle of the film, without resolving to a satisfying (for me) conclusion, but I also did not want it to END! That's how fascinating the characterizations are. McDormand and Rockwell are both standouts, but Harrelson definitely holds his own with them, as well as all of the supporting cast.

It's satirical of many things: love, marriage, family, small town life, small town cops and police-in-general, life and mortality, younger people, and older people. Though, like most noir films, TBOEM is VERY profane, gritty, and violent, a subtle compassion and a definite moral ultimately comes through, and it avoids the pitfall of simply being tasteless for the sake of being tasteless. Fine acting by just about the entire cast, with special kudos going to Frances McDormand and Caleb Jones. Fittingly ironic soundtrack too.

243,11 January 2018,vsks,9," You think it's about chutzpah, but it's about heartbreak","On a drive through the American South some years ago, British writer-director Martin McDonagh saw a set of billboards that challenged the authorities similar to the way the sheriff of Ebbing, Missouri, is challenged in this film. The rage they embodied stayed with him, and although this film is billed as a black comedy, don't go looking for belly laughs. Its true subject is heartbreak. 
With an intelligent script that's perhaps a few minutes too long, McDonagh's characters' actions impinge on others like billiard balls knocking about on the table. Mildred Hayes (played by Frances McDormand-a genius at portraying tough, uncompromising women) intends for her actions to affect others when she pays for three billboards to be pasted up on a remote stretch of road outside town, blood red and anger-filled: ""Raped While Dying. And Still No Arrests? How Come, Sheriff Willoughby?"" Guilt and anger are written just as clearly on her unsmiling face.
The sheriff's deputies, accustomed to have their way in all local matters, great and small, are offended. They want her to take them down. Of course she won't. One of them, Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell) is an overgrown boy, prey to his every violent whim and McDonagh gives him a complex character arc.
Sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) has other troubles on his mind and, while it's true he hasn't made progress in solving Angela Hayes's murder, it isn't true that he hasn't tried. Although his place in their world is the slipperiest, he has the best sense of what that place is.
Several supporting roles are equally powerful (I especially liked Mildred's ex-husband's new girlfriend), and there are some laughs-people being their natural selves can be hilarious, usually without meaning to be. Though a broken heart manifests itself differently in all three main characters, it's Sheriff Willoughby who points the way to healing. Already the film has received numerous awards and nominations, including the Golden Globe for best motion picture drama, with Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell, and Martin McDonagh (screenplay) winners too.",

Had I known that ""In Bruges"" wrote and directed this as well, I might have avoided it, or at least gone in with no expectations. Perhaps then I would also have been less surpristed by the weird feel of the characters which is explained by the writer's ignorance of the sort of people he is trying to portray. The overall concept of the film is good, but almost every element of it is poorly executed. I'm somewhat puzzled that none of the actors, especially Frances McDormand did not review their dialogue and protest that their characters were stilted and not quite right, kind of like Invasion of the Body Snatchers imitations of real people. Overall, it was a waste of an extraordinary ensemble cast, especially the principals, McDormand and Rockwell who each do a very good job with the material they were given, but also a waste of Peter Dinklage who seemed to be there just to be the midget, and Clarke Peters who had basically nothing to do. I'm not a prude for language, but the use of it in this movie reminded me of the anecdote about Mark Twain responding to his wife's attempt to shame him with a stream of vulgarity, saying, ""You have the notes, but you just ain't got the music."" The violence was completely out of kilter also because the director never adequately set a tone to the movie. Was the violence supposed to be comic, and that is why nobody gets arrested, or was it supposed to be realistic and the characters in the show are really that stupid? It's impossible to understand during the course of the film. One starts out very much wanting to be sympathetic with McDormand's character and then, in desperation with any character in the movie, but to no avail. Each of the main characters turn out to be execrable, unsympathetic people with no consistent human pathos. The final ""villain"" character is nothing more than a tremendous plot hole so deep and dense that he is a veritable black hole that sucks all suspension of disbelief down into an alternate universe, leaving one wishing that another choice of movie had been made.",

The story wasn't terribly exciting but the characters made the story so moving and gripping. The acting by everyone in it was superb. Not a big fan of all the bad language but it did make the film feel more grittily real. I usually prefer more fantastical films which give some escapism but I surprised myself and the film itself surprised me. Sam Rockwell (whom I have liked since The Green Mile) was such a dislikeable character but the way he developed through the film was really well done. The film plays well on your emotions and somehow manages to bring little bits of humour out of a tragic situation and some appalling decisions. I still smile thinking about my favourite bit when Sam Rockwell's character shies away a little bit from his lighter (because of what has happened to him - I won't spoil it by saying what). It doesn't sound funny here but he makes even a small thing like this funny. The film makes you think about how inherently decent people can make bad or good choices and what the unexpected consequences can be.

I know: the whole point is to mock violence, indulge violence, and comment on our obsession with violence while implying the need for justice. But a movie has to be willing to take a stance, risk sentimentality, and risk being moral if it wants to be successful-if it wants to be more than artful and ""original."" Over-the-top violence is never funny to my sensibility, and I think it says more about our collective inability to solve our mass shooting problem and pervasive social-psychological disconnection (preferring social media to real intimacy) than it does the movie's sophistication. When police chief Sam Rockwell knocks the kid off the roof and then goes down to the street to kick him into the hospital, camera's viewpoint where his gun would be holstered, it's disgusting, pointless, and not at all funny to this viewer. That they meet later in the hospital is supposed to function as some kind of double irony and edgy rapprochement, but it's simply exhausting.

Only the messages delivered aren't in the name of some big-name brand or local company, but they are the deliberately confrontational words of grieving, thoroughly pissed-off mother Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand). The first billboard reads 'Raped While Dying', followed by 'And Still No Arrests', and finally 'How Come, Chief Willoughby?' The opening scenes of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which see Mildred negotiate a deal with businessman Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones) and quickly install the provocative messages, set up a David-versus-Goliath story, in which a justice-seeking woman sets out to shame and spring into action the police department she feels has failed her following the brutal rape and murder of her daughter.",

The acting was superb and like Benito Del Toro in Traffic, I am sure Frances McDormand is a shoe-in for a few awards, however my standout was Sam Rockwell. A loathsome character, with lots of flaws but ultimately redeemable. Woody Harrelson was his usual laconic joy to watch and keeps getting better.

This movie is dark, sad, and violent. Lots of profanity and prejudice in this hick town suffering from the violent murder of the local teen. The people of this town have a love-hate relationship with each other and they act out everything they feel.

I already had high hopes for this movie and it definitely did not disappoint! Concept of the movie seems pretty easy to understand: Mildred Hayes (played by Frances McDormand) is still grieving the loss of her murdered daughter and challenges the local sheriff's (Woody Harrelson) inability to find her killer. From watching the trailer I was a little unsure if this was going to be a drama or a comedy, but turns out it was both, or more accurately a dark comedy. The first few minutes of the movie really set the tone for keeping you interested in the dramatic core, maintaining the humour in events as they unfold. Not only are the characters perfectly cast individually (example my fav Sam Rockwell as Officer Jason Dixon), but the writing of the entire script makes it so easy to enjoy this entire movie. ",

304,27 November 2017,pyrocitor,9, The Twit and the Pendulum,"Between Bruges and Missouri, if being a writer/director weren't enough, Martin McDonagh could seemingly easily find an alternate calling as an unorthodox travel agent. Of course, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is as much a straight- faced travelogue of the Midwestern United States as McDonagh's In Bruges is a gentle comedy of tourism - namely, not at all. McDonagh's films defy easy categorization with as much flamboyance and vitriolic wit as they subvert narrative expectation, with twists and inversions as wacky as they are devastatingly human. And Three Billboards may be his sharpest, most tenderly sadistic cross-section of human behaviour yet, exemplifying his customary deftness for unpacking the weird, terrible, and unexpectedly graceful decisions people make under intolerably extreme circumstances. Even more impressively: he fans the flames with a seasoning of searing sociopolitical urgency amidst the salty banter and unexpected bursts of extreme violence, before pulling the rug out from under us once again for something altogether more moving and raw.

305,15 November 2017,ccorral419,8, Stagy dark comedy with good acting,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. When a film is so highly spoken about it can mean one of two things: 1) It's going to be a great film, or 2) the praise is being overstate. Unfortunately, ""Three Billboards..."" falls into the later category, as director/writer Martin McDonagh (""Seven Psychopaths"" 2012) presents an intriguing dark comedy that ultimately comes across as a variety of individual scenes put together to make a story. Featuring Frances McDormand (""Fargo""), Woody Harrelson (""The Hunger Games""), Sam Rockwell (""The Way Way Back""), Luca Hedges (""Manchester by the Sea""), Caleb Landrey (""Get Out""), Zeljko Ivanek (""Argo"") and Peter Dinklage (""Game of Thrones""), the acting is not the problem here. McDonagh's sets are stagy, his writing is lackluster, he tends to add in scenes/character in order to oddly move the story along, and the ending does nothing for the flow of the film. Standing out in this heavily star packed film is Caleb Landrey. Landrey is initially had to understand, due to an unexplainable accent, however, he over comes this weakness by graciously playing the victim. ""Three Billboards"" is far from a clunker. I guess I just expected a more tightly woven and satisfying production.",

Despite Martin McDonagh's magnificently rich story filled with complexities and twisting turns and the well written dialogues, it's the strength of the performances from Frances McDormand (whose expressive eyes show every thought and capture the depths of her pain), Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell that keeps ""Three Billboards"" up.

309,21 January 2018,evrivali,10, Unusual but AWESOME,"We saw a lot of great movies in 2017 and I can confidently say that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is one of them. Written and directed by Martin McDonagh the movie is a winner in every category . It's original, it has great performances and a plot full of brutal, funny and sad moments. It's balance of humor, violence and drama is remarkable and not easy at all to find in today's movies. The real asset of this movie though is Frances McDormand. She plays a non likable and very complex character and delivers one of the greatest performances I have ever seen. She manages to make you like and fully understand a violent character, basically the 'villain' of the movie something that I have experienced very few times and that's one of the reasons I gave the movie 10 stars. The truth is ,not everyone can appreciate and understand the bizarre style of the movie and I am very disappointed to see that this movie is hated by a lot of people. Love it or hate it there is no denying that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a unique movie and definitely something that you don't see everyday. I believe though that even more people are going to love it and that's the reason I decided to write this review. To maybe push people to watch it and see with their own eyes McDonagh's great achievement.",
310,18 January 2018,senan-gilsenan,9," Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance.","The writer & director, Martin McDonagh, has managed to capture the subtle dark sense of humour which often seems to accompany death and grieving. He recognises how it is used as a coping mechanism to deal with the loss of a loved one; yet the line between drawing offense or being funny is thin. 
McDonagh mastered this in his first film, In Bruge, which was marketed as comedy, even though it dealt with murder and suicide. A lot of the audience see 3 billboards as a comedy too, but it is not. Truthfully, it is another film which deals with grieving and loss, all five stages of it, with all the myriad expressions of denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance.
The small town setting in Missouri works really well. It could almost be a small town in Ireland , or anywhere for that matter. Small towns are small pools in which the big fish are always the more louder and brashist characters. Enter Sam Rockwell, who plays the role of a racist policeman who redeems himself in the end. He is the equal to Colin Farrell's characters in 7 Psychopaths (another McDonagh film which they both starred in) and In Bruge. 
Frances McDormand is commanding in nearly every scene playing a local anti-hero who everyone is polite to on account of the recent loss of her daughter, yet behind her back they all judge. 
Woody Harrelson is just getting better and better at playing yet another role in which he almost sucks in both respect and empathy. 
This is such a fine film that I watched it again, the very next day. It is a non-Hollwood production which despite winning Best Picture at the Golden Globes, it seems to be getting it fair share of 'haters' in America. I would guess that this is because of the dissmissive way in which the narratve deals with racism in the Southern States. It seems to say that at the end of the day, people are just people and that a person's colour is irrelevant.",

Every time I was getting settled in, it felt like the movie slapped me awake with some new twist. I mean this in the best possible way. Everyone complains when it comes to Hollywood, there's nothing new under the sun so if someone does something original, its only fair to heap praise upon them. Three Billboards is certainly its own thing, we go from extremely vulgar humour (cleverly written but vulgar) to a character committing murder in a heartbeat.

314,9 March 2018,JMaccabeus,1, Tedious garbage masquerading as art.,"Boring and slow but I watched it in its entirety in the same way one morbidly looks at a bad highway accident because the movie is enlightening as to how low functioning, ignorant and racist Hollywood perceives the average person (you & me) to be. The police are portrayed as stupid to the point of mental retardation, openly committing violent & utterly pointless felonies in front of countless witnesses. They are inexplicably not held accountable for their actions. Likewise, when our almost equally ignorant hero firebombs a police station, the entire community knows she did it, and yet nothing comes from it. Such a crime would be an international news story that would mandate a major FBI investigation. The point is, this movie is completely detached from reality in every regard. Real people don't think or talk this way. People don't act this way. Reality dictates that there are unavoidable consequences for bad choices that don't apply in the fantasy world of this movie. Although this movie is not unique in this regard, I don't know that I have ever seen one so overtly contemptuous of common people. Ironic given the lack of education and real world experience that most of these Hollywood elitists actually have. Here is a tip for Hollywood on how to make real art instead of this garbage masquerading as art: in reality, the differences between the average person and the smug elites is negligible. A few bad choices for those without a safety net can create a life trajectory very difficult to recover from. Enough with the smug disrespect for customer base.",

The film reflects the harsh reality of the world we live and while the film does paint the police force in Ebbing Missouri as incompetent, it also shows the hard task that they face when trying to catch killers and rapists. The films premise and story aspects feel relatable as the tragedy that befell Frances McDormand's characters daughter, has most likely happened to someone else and the characters act in way that feels real and their reaction to certain events in the film are justified.

329,17 December 2017,CineMuseFilms,8, a mother's enraged quest for justice at any cost,"If it were possible to name the dominant emotion swirling around the world today it would be anger. Its many causes include social inequality, political instability, and global brinkmanship, all of which create a collective sense of helplessness due to events and systems over which we have no control. Any film that gives expression to this anger is cathartic, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017) hits this mark right from the outset.
Seven months after the rape and murder of Angela Hayes, her mother Mildred (Frances McDormand) is ready to explode. Local police investigations have stalled, she is not getting any updates, and she believes that much more could be done. She rents three neglected billboards and plasters three simple messages against blood-red backgrounds: ""Raped while dying""; ""And still no arrests""; and ""How come, Chief Willoughby?"". The shocked town is instantly divided into those sympathetic to Mildred's plight and those supportive of terminally ill Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). Police are outraged, national media get involved, and Mildred's son and former husband try to talk her out of her protest. Events spiral out of control: there are outbursts of police racism, homophobia, bashings, arson, a suicide, as well as community outpouring of sympathy for Willoughby and blame for Mildred. Undeterred and hell bent on revenge, she sets a course into nihilism without regard for the consequences.
Not since Network (1978) when enraged Peter Finch screamed ""I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore"" has a film penetrated the global zeitgeist with such forensic accuracy. When Mildred lets loose, it feels good and right. McDormand's powerhouse feminist performance makes this her film: no other contemporary actress does cold anger like she can and still offer a warm vulnerability to make us care. Harrelson is a complex opposite: reasonable, wounded, and compassionate. His likeability is the film's greatest complication: while we share Mildred's anger we also want to quarantine Willoughby, especially when we meet his beautiful wife and daughters.
Three Billboards is telling us that to feel human we sometimes must do extreme things. Whether you accept that message or not, this film offers a safety valve for anyone who feels crushed by the system. Labelling it a 'black comedy' is a loose fit for a film full of surprises where most of the humour is found in lightning fast one-liners laced with multiple F-bombs. The blackness lies in the moral ambiguity of Mildred's behaviour: she is channelling eye-for-an-eye justice and it matters little if the wrong person pays. Whatever you make of it, this is a gripping film that you are unlikely to forget soon.",

Another may find fatherhood or motherhood their highest calling investing most of their life energy to the task but give little thought to being cruel to a server at a restaurant or a pet dog. Sometimes our values in one area of our lives seem entirely incongruous with the values we hold in another area and the incongruity can strike others as downright bizarre. This value incongruity is a theme in other writer/director Martin McDonagh's films but is a central focus in Three Billboards. ,

So many thing to choose from but the main things that are most wrong are the things that are most praised by critics. The acting for example. You can PLAINLY see Rockwell and Harrelson occassionally barely stiffling a laught in the interactions, when Rockwell is playing a fool, like in the office with Frances. I dont understand how they let something so visible through the editing process. Or Frances, every time when trying to ""act"" she looks serious and then in the last 2 seconds before cut, she narrows her eyes. ITs like watching a wooden 1 year acting student act. 
Or the so called character study and supposed brilliant portrayal. I understand the pain and regret of the last encounter with the daughter but the woman was a complete B*tch from beginning to the end, the was no progress in her story. And how does killing a person correlate to anything good in the movie or their lifes? Fine, they werent sure but just when they were supposed to be seeing the senselessness of the world and life, their characters take a huge step, not step even, lead back in their development and go back to the beggining. 
Not to mention how she was portrayed as compassionate and starting to understand things and then in the SAME 2 minutes she completely insults and devalues her date in the restaurant but then goes and does something ""nice"" for her husband's date. Who TF wrote this nonsense. Make up your mind.
Lets not even get into the Woody shooting himself with kids in the house when he couldve done much more considerately etc...

A grieving mother seeking justice and answers, and the Chief of Police who feels he's done his job to the best of his ability. McDormand's blunt, rude, vulgar, and uncensored character is extremely charismatic. The other characters (one in particular after some major character development) are very charismatic as well. This film takes the audience on a very dark journey where nothing ""expected"" or ""predictable"" really happens. We become very invested in a brilliant story with direction we are fools to think we can foresee.

From the opening credits to the end I was continually impressed and taken aback by this movie at virtually all levels - From the outstanding performances to the raw and darkly funny screenplay to the wonderful score by Carter Burwell - Who incidentally composed one of my favorite western themes for the Coen Brother's ""True Grit"". Already being a fan of Martin McDonagh, it wasn't difficult for me to believe the people raving about this movie on the festival circuit. He is easily one of the best auteurs working today which might be helped by him being a successful former playwright. McDonagh writes and directs this film and injects it with his signature cynicism and black comedy. It just so happens that he also assembled the perfect cast led by essentially the Queen of black comedy Frances McDormand to knock it out of the park.

It is quite interesting that an Irish - British director succeeded to make such a sharp film about the territory that we know so little especially out of the US - the deep America, the one far of the glamour of the big cities or the sparks of high-tech. We should not be amazed however, as Martin McDonagh is a very special kind of artist, a playwright of great talent who has gradually broadened the scope of his plays from the Irish history and political present to British realities, and later to more broader human topics. As a film director he started with a short film set in Ireland that won an Academy Award in 2006, while his next two feature films are set in Europe (In Bruges) and Hollywood (Seven Psychopaths). The story in 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' takes place in the heart of America, I would almost say to the bleeding heart of the country, as the small city in Missouri can be seen as a micro-model of the complex realities of the US, with its prejudice and violence, but also with the humanity and power to heal of its people.

409,28 February 2018,tmpsvita,9, Another great movie from Martin McMcDonag,"Martin McDonagh despite having made very few films, just two before this (""7 psychopaths"" and ""Bruges""), with each of them has proved to be a great director, I'm sorry a little fot the fact that he worked ""little"", but better only three and excellent movies than thirty mediocre.
And even with this ""Three billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" McDonagh is able to do a good job, indeed in this case it could be promoted to extraordinary work; it is not in fact difficult to define it his best film.
A very powerful film, strong, even quite heavy but still engaging that manages to tell a truly incredible story in a very credible and human.
Human, powerful but at the same time also a bit 'cold and perhaps this is one of the few flaws that can be attributed, the director in fact, probably with the fear of exaggeration and finally realize a feel-good movie has tried as much as possible not push too much on emotion. As much as I appreciate this (the tearful films are not really my kind) I have to say that I would have preferred more attention on the feelings, do not get me wrong but in some moments I felt a certain distance / coldness of the director and due of which the film fails to completely displace the viewer or to make him excite as much as it could.
With all this I do not want to discredit the film, cause , it is a great movie, as I said in the first lines.
The direction, apart from that, is really remarkable, especially from the point of view more visual and technical, the shots are, in fact, extraordinary: extremely precise, clean, suggestive. Some of the images in the film are truly unforgettable.
The interpretation of the protagonist, Frances McDormand, is also unforgettable, an actress whom I particularly appreciate and who in this case has really given her best, has entered perfectly in her character and succeeds, thanks to her expressions and incredibly convincing looks, to be credible as few would have succeeded.
Also I was speechless to see a Sam Rockwell so good, has always been a difficult actor for me to appreciate mainly for his face that reeks of second best (although I have already appreciated him in ""The Way Way Back"" while I still have to see him in "" Moon""), but with this film I completely changed my mind, he really surprised me a lot.
While Woody Harrelson I have always thought totally the opposite and with this role is interpretation has only reconfirmed his skill.
A special mention goes to the truly extraordinary, captivating, mature, sharp and profound script.

After seeing an 8.5 star rating I was so excited to see this movie.....and I wanted to see it quickly before I heard or read too many spoilers. In my opinion, ratings that high are reserved for movies like Forrest Gump, Titanic, Shawshank and Good Fellas so I really went into this with high expectations. This movie did proceed along quickly with enough twists and humor to keep you interested but it is so far fetched that it becomes stupid. The police are portrayed like characters from The Dukes of Hazzard so you just roll your eyes every time they talk. Then they get away with criminal acts with no recourse much like detectives in Lethal Weapon. Shoot your gun, kill people, break the law.....do what you want, after all, you're the police....right? This is truly a 4 star movie. You may not hate watching it but it is in no way a must see. As mentioned in many reviews the acting by Frances and Woody is very, very good and you can't help but love the resolve of the main character who is willing to stand up for what she is trying to accomplish as well as the pain Woody is going through in his life. But again, you just can't ignore the foolish scenes that occur. Ever seen a western where a guy shoots his gun 45 times without reloading? Or better yet a movie where the hero shoots 6 times and kills 6 bad guys all who had automatic weapons and were firing back at him.....Need a fire extinguisher?....Her's a 50 gallon one in the front seat of my car. It's those kind of occurrences that happen throughout the movie that make you say ""oh come on"" about 7-8 times throughout the movie. The most unfortunate thing about this movie is that those scenes were not necessary. It had enough going for it that a more realistic approach could have bumped this up to a much higher rating.",

So as the oscars nominations cameout yesterday, i like to watch every nominated film which i didnt yet watch and i started with ""Three billboards ... "" ( such a long title ). 
I started this movie with great expectations due to its 8 nominations. As the movie went on i thought when will they catch the killer 
isnt that the whole point? 
Absolutely not! 
The whole point was in a great scene at the burning police station 
How the contrast was made with a woman burning down a police station and a man listening to music and reading a letter from his deceased partner about how he thought the ""antagonist"" (at this point) was a good guy and all he needs was to love and how love gives everyone better life and saves him from a fire.
Clearly this wasn't the first time when a character turned from bad to good 
Woody harrleson turned from ""going to war"" to sending a note to the woman who caused him trouble before death and i think the reason was his cancer spreading.
The advertising agency guy showed compassion to the fired police officer eventhough he was quite angry.
At the scene where they were going to kill the army officer, I felt as if the whole story was showing that the anger always wins but when they started raising doubts 
I was very happy that both of them were getting over their anger ",

And no one pointed out that this movie is just another example of Hollywood portraying women as men. If half of what Hollywood has been giving us lately is true we need to start a Stop the Violence by Women Against Men organization. It started when Hollywood remade movies and put women in the previous male roles. Now they are putting women in violent roles that used to be, more believably, given to men. Violent women, Wonder Woman, Atomic Blond, the list goes on. Women should be embarrassed to see themselves portrayed the way McDormand portrays this character. Some women watch women being tough in movies and on television and think that they can be tough.

The subject matter and the overall tone of the picture are very strong: anger, hate, violence and grief dominate, and I honestly did not grasp that comic touch noticed by some criticism.
No doubt everything works inside the picture: screenplay and shooting reinforce each other, but they could not work at full, hadn't they been supported by the top-notch acting.

In this way, its overall messages are actually quite inspiring, optimistic and, dare I say, sort of hopeful, even if the feature is generally a rather downbeat and hopeless affair right until its final, suitably low-key frame. It's an experience that feels like it has something significant to say about grief, with the lasting impression being strangely life-affirming in its own uniquely sardonic kind of way, and the almost second-to-none character work on display is truly phenomenal on all sides, to the point where almost every inhabitant of the eponymous town felt like a breathing human being. That's really the main effect you get from the piece, allowing you to spend time with people you wouldn't really want to spend time with but in the process come to truly understand them, and it's rare for a work to accomplish such a connection - especially with characters whose ethics are as questionable as these. 7/10.",

The language makes for a very realistic portrayal of small town life in the back of beyond. The violence will take you by surprise, even when you correctly predict what is about to happen. This is quite a feat and worthy of credit for the achievement. McDormand provides a thoughtfully expressed depiction of the kind of disenchanted, sad, mad and determined woman the murder victim's mother could likely be in such a real life situation like her character's. She nails it throughout, never missing a beat. There are amusing interludes sprinkled throughout...and completely necessary to keep us believing the story. It is indeed an interesting story but it does terminate a couple of scenes too early. Mildred does not realise she is going to confront the man who threatened her in her shop, her ex police dept buddy doesn't know she's met the man he suspects is involved in murdering Mildred's daughter.

It's a beautifully constructed script, character and plot beats paced out with subtle precision; and it looks subtly beautiful, cinematography, colour and lighting coalescing to haunting effects. It feels redundant to say that Frances McDormand is superb; at this point in her career, she's an actor whose excellence is guaranteed. It's also more than a little influenced by the crime dramas of the Coen brothers - in tone, plot and much else, it's easy to imagine this as one of theirs. All the characters in this film feel as if they're trapped in a situation they want out of but can't navigate the way, their solutions are always just out of reach. It's as melancholy as it is funny, and it's never short of compassionate human insight.",

McDormand's character, Marge, is a toxic robot of intolerance and simplistic vigilante justice attitude. The police are drawn as cartoonish bigots and creeps as though Black Lives Matter had written this script, and the story itself has no real structure, arc, or conclusion.

I did laugh on a few occasions because of some funny dialogue. But I think, in sum, it's very much a movie about a director desperately trying to be the Coen brothers without the talent or even a concept. Maybe it didn't help the movie to have Frances McDormand in it because it makes the viewer feel like: ""Oh, cool, that's gonna be hilarious"" and then the movie goes on and on, and it never gets hilarious, and at some time you're wondering what's the point. What are we supposed to make of all these story lines and characters? For instance, the bad guy having a beer at the local pub bragging about raping a girl while she is burning to death? Come on. And all the senseless beating up? The last 30 minutes feel like they are looking for a good point to end this disaster but they don't find one so they just stop.",

The script handles this mode of tragedy very well but at the same time manages a very intelligent and very well thought comedy. Although some of the characters try to be funny in times of stress and tension, which makes them insignificant in my opinion, the whole cast is amazing, but obviously the most outstanding is Frances McDormand's character. She is an unfiltered psycho who seeks justice for the death of her daughter. She's everything in this film, even her facial expressions are amazing. The film manages a very interesting comedy, for example, Carter Burwell puts a slow music to put you in a sad mood and make you feel for the characters and suddenly... you laugh. It is very unusual but hilarious.",
443,1 December 2017,ariarostami,1, For those that hated the film and are petrified by these good reviews,"The whole way through I realized that this film isn't full of racist characters, the film is just racist. The way the man that was pasting up the billboards spoke to the cop who ""tortured people of color"" (what was that scene all about BTW?) - was completely tone deaf to how Black people have to interact with the police, especially overtly racist ones! It just seemed a masturbatory way for the writer/director to create a false reality where he can exercise his white-guilt about cops torturing Black people. That same character comes up later with the replacement billboards like some magical hero who was ""always on the right side"" (because Black people hate cops I guess?) that only exists to be a servant to Mildred. Her friend in the store, Denise, is only there as a tool for the audience/Mildred to be angry at the cops but has absolutely no depth herself. And the new Chief is, again, only an extension of the writer's enormous White guilt. For such a racist White town, that doesn't seemed to be bothered about a cop that tortures Black people, it seems that no one is bothered by a new Black Chief - who has come to no protest by the people and conveniently fixes racism within the police force by firing the one racist. (Woody Harrelson's line about if you fired every racist cop you'd just have three that hated fags is an insane apologist stance too.) In fact, this new chief is such a ""good guy,"" (I hate to say it because it's so gross, but what a classic example of an Uncle Tom) that he forgives and overlooks Mildred who blew up a police station and attempted to murder someone. These character's Blackness only exists to serve Mildred, it's flimsy and exploitative. Also, that monologue about the Catholic church is nauseating - she defends a racist law created to throw as many Black people in prison as possible and relates it to child molestation in the church (also, throws in homosexuality as an equivalent to pedophilia) which is supposed to be a ""you-go-girl"" moment but ultimately you can't side with her because the priest is the only character in the film that was there for the son. I read a quote from the writer/director that Mildred is an antihero which may explain that last scene but... what the f***? Your protagonist is a woman demanding that the police find the man that raped and murdered her daughter and decided that she is going to be an antihero???? She's not liked by the town for being zealous and she's not liked by the audience for everything else... It takes sharp turns from comedy to drama, cutting both aspects short at the wrong times with none of the humor in the antihero aspect - it's an excuse to have a woman in a revenge role to say that it's a film with a woman in a revenge role... taking notes from the Coen Brothers, Tarantino, Ritchie, and Twin Peaks but missing all of those marks by miles. Not a single female character, not one, had any depth. The ex-husband's new girlfriend for one, was a cartoon based on women being complete morons. Almost all the characters had some sense of being real people but then they throw in a character as comedic relief and the joke is ""women are horrendously stupid."" Even Mildred is a one note story, she's an angry, bitter mother. Her character arch was completely neutered to fulfill the character arch of the antagonist, a racist who read a letter and is all better now. The second half of the film is just a way to apologize for officer Dixon's wrong-doings - some White male guilt fantasy that he can be redeemed of all of his sins if you just gave the poor guy a chance. That's who the story serves in the end, it IS NOT ABOUT a grieving mother that wants answers, it's not about a child getting raped and murdered, those are just points added in to ultimately give redemption to the wrong doings of white men in power and absolve the writer/director of whatever sins of his own I'm sure he's working through in this film. I even read a quote that he was happy this film was being released among the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment wave as this film is a place for that anger... wow. Also... The Dwarf character was just used as the butt of what felt like 100 jokes and his redemption is some after school special line about ""you judge me for looking different, but look at you"" - that character is an adult, why is he consistently trying to date Mildred and cover for her? (hint: to make the audience feel better about laughing at endless midget jokes when he gets the final word.) Then the rapist who murdered someone in some ""Sandy country"" (-_-) is drawn as simple as some of the women in this film. I guess the writer/director is claiming that - it's not war that brings out the worst in people - some people rape and kill and brag about it to their buddies over a drink with no signs of PTSD, shame, guilt. PTSD would not justify rape and murder, but it is an extension of ""people can do good if they just changed their minds"" that we saw with Officer Dixon. (Maybe there will be a sequel where the rapist says he's sorry and spends the rest of the film teaching Black kids how to play basketball. Seems like a fit continuation for this confused film.) Too many false endings too with no real good conclusion other than, again, to serve as a nice pillow for the redemption of officer Dixon to rest on. Would've been better if the climax was the Chief's suicide and the resolution was that he gave the money to Mildred.",

Her ex-husband was abusive but after the divorce, he still lives in the same town. More importantly, her beloved daughter was raped, burned, and murdered in cruel fashion. This was six months ago and there have been no arrests. The sheriff, Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and his erratic deputy, Dixon (Sam Rockwell) have done their investigations and there are few new options. Nevertheless, Mildred believes her daughter's case is being filed and forgotten. Therefore, when she drives down a little-traveled road near her town of Ebbing, Missouri, she spies three billboards ready for new ads. Plunking down a cool $5000 of her own money, she asks the advertising company to put up questions relating to her child's murder, goading the sheriff's office. No, Willoughby is not happy. For a spell, television crews come and focus on Mildred's cause. But, no leads emerge. Meanwhile, Willoughby is seriously ill with cancer , making some of the townfolk turn against Mildred. All this while Milllie's ex-husband is parading around with a 19 year old girlfriend, her son has difficulty at high school, the town's dwarf (Peter Dinklage) wants to date Millie, and Deputy Dixon has a love-hate relationship with his mother. Will a killer be brought to justice? This powerhouse film is strong and serious but is not for all. For one, the language is profane quite often and there is violence, too. Some viewers will not be comfortable with these two matters. On the other hand, the cast is superb, with McDormand and Rockwell leading the way but with all cast members contributing mightily. The setting is rustic and unusual while script and direction are complete treasures. There are valuable lessons and entertaining hours to be taken from Three Billboards.

Watching Frances McDormand play a rebellious mother of a woman who was raped while dying is satisfying to the extent that can only be disturbed by Sam Rockwell's performance as this fiery young policeman who boasts off his racism as his grandest weapon. If not the cliched story, there is enough bulbs of entertainment and social issue treatment to consume here that is topped with some of the most fabulous performances of the year. Woody Harrelson joins the talented cast as the police chief who is torn between the mother's rebellious stunt - iconic in the movie and for the next few decades - and a personal issue to drive the crisply-written film that mocks the law enforcement system and reinforces the theory that man is the biggest and most powerful killer. Other than few slips in Martin McDonagh's writing towards the end, there's not a dull moment in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, MIssouri which, if not too cinematic, has some great billboard design and a ritzy ad agency office. Watch it for its relevant theme, incredible performances, the subtle references that are so highly relatable, and the basic idea that of those billboards. TN.",

I suspect that those giving it a 9 or a 10 do so as they regard themselves as a lover of ""art films"" or something. An ""emperor's new clothes"" film for definite with it getting many high scores solely due to reviewers not wanting to appear to have peasant film tastes if they were more honest and gave it a low score. The number of awards a film has received, Oscars etc., should not influence a score awarded on IMDB reviewers should make their own mind up.

458,2 February 2018,matthewssilverhammer,8," A Mess...An Entertaining, Provocative Mess","McDonagh (In Bruges) revels in shoving tragedy and comedy right against each other, and he does so with immense ease and an awareness that that delicate balance of the two is what real-life is made of. With Three Billboards, he's trying to marry that authenticity with a heightened sense of storytelling, specifically in the stylized dialogue and detailed characters. This exercise results in some inescapable messiness throughout the movie, yet there's so much compelling and highly entertaining filmmaking on display here you barely notice.
McDormand turns in a powerhouse performance as a vengeful Midwestern mom who buys three billboards in her town that shame local law enforcement for not doing enough to find the man who raped and killed her daughter. With dark subject matter and colorful humor bedding together, it's not an easy movie to take in. Yet despite the film's groove taking a minute to find, those complexities that make it difficult are what make it great. A lovely look at what small-town America really acts like, the characters' motivations and intentions are revealed slowly, and there's not a bad performance in the bunch. Harrelson's character is strongly upright yet deeply sad, and Rockwell brings immense depth to his racist, drunk Barney Fife role.
And the film's edges are as rough as its characters. Metaphors are thinly veiled, characters change when needed, subtext becomes text. However, because the movie, at its core, is just a morality tale, everything is there to support its main point: tragedy changes lives, but vengeance destroys them. And luckily that central message is more open-ended, allowing the movie to sit with its audience long after the individual issues have been washed away.",

465,14 February 2020,Offworld_Colony,10, I think this is very much an example of what cinema was made for. Three Billboards is excellent.,"It's a film much like the, often focused on, tied back undercut of Frances McDormand's hair; it very much presents two diametrically opposed things at once, one on top, one underneath and it lets us feel the way we want about them. Frances' Mildred may very well have been crazy before her daughter was killed, we don't know as we're mercifully and brilliantly dropped in months into her grieving process. People don't generally write slice of life films like this unless they're true stories, which intensifies the proof of skill writer/director Martin McDonagh has with writing nuanced, balanced, flawed characters. He manages, from his background writing plays, to not waste a single scene, there is not one moment in this film that doesn't bleed into another at some point and every moment gives weight to the next in the kind of suspense, surprise and momentum that other films just dream of having. The film uses its small microcosm of Ebbing, Missouri, and it's small incomplete story, to subvert film cliches effortlessly. There's a moment where Woody Harrelson coughs blood in the middle of a tough interrogation scene and the artificiality of his demeanour and that moment is just killed dead; his face shocked like a little boy's, his subject actually instantly taking pity on him. I've seen this in real life, I've never seen a moment like this in film, a construct built on artificiality, to use that construct to break it, just to show how human these human-like artifices are, is as close to magic as cinema gets.

472,9 September 2018,akcenat,8, A strong movie (with some unfortunate flaws),"The movie follows grieving mother (Frances McDormand) after the unsolved murder of her teenage daughter. As she becomes frustrated with the local police's lack of progress, she decides to rent three billboards on the outskirts of her hometown to send a personal message to the authorities... but what those billboards trigger is not what she expects. Great characters, great performances and great writing make movie memorable. McDormand is simply superb as the mother whose anger is just part of her problems in life. Movie is a hugely entertaining, no mater basically it's a drama. But, at times, the plot is lacking in direction and can come across as a little too sarcastic and even cartoonish at times, but overall, the writing is so strong and the acting is so on point.

""Three billboards out of Ebbing"" manages to delve into human psychology better than almost every film that I have seen up to date. The events are being portrayed both with tragic and comical scenes giving a grey aspect in the film's aesthetic. Same goes with the characters. No one in this movie is either bad or good person. They are just persons. With both their good and their bad side. The film doesn't choose sides. Frances McDormand is excellent as the mourning mother of her horrible killed daughter. Woody Harrelson is amazing as the dying from cancer police chief of Ebbing who tries his best to do his duty in a world that doesn't appreciate it. But the revelation of this film is Sam Rockwell. This actor delivers his best performance until now and maybe for his whole career. All the actors (leading or secondary) are acting their roles perfectly delivering us the message of this masterpiece of a film; no person is only good or only bad. The film doesn't justify any person's actions and doesn't choose to support anyone. It just presents us the events as they are; a mingle of tragedy and comedy just like life. People can easily do bad as easily as they can do good. And they can be really good if they try. Martin McDonaugh's film is a masterpiece which in a couple of decades it will be considered a classic and one of the most representative films of American independent cinema.",

Great art elicits such responses and I'm for it. The acting, editing and cinematography were extraordinary. McDorland gives a stunning performance of a mother driven to focused and sometimes unfocused fury. Violence suffuses the entire movie, including the violence of foreign wars. This plot thread was, for me, the only real problem with the movie, the ""Idaho"" character makes no sense to the movie, particularly the scene where he comes into the gift store, what was that about? He had no connection to any one in the town, as far as I could tell. Criticism regarding penciled in race issues and characters seem less of an issue, it wasn't that kind of movie, class matters in this movie, violence matters in this movie, southern gothic matters. Most of the criticism focusing on race and deep structural issues in the film are long pieces that go into fine detail why this movie isn't very good, and I like this level of heavy lifting, the movie is not easily dismissed and should be seen and you can come to your own conclusion regarding it's merits (as is always true).

Of course, they also were because of the massive deal of awards recognition this has received in the last couple months. It is one of the films that has a shot at taking home Best Picture at the Oscars this year. It runs for slightly under 2 hours and takes us on a journey into the life of Mildred Hayes, who fights the local police department hoping this is gonna speed things up in the difficult task of finding her daughter's killer. The police gets represented by the performances of Rockwell and Harrelson here and Rockwell (like McDormand) seems in a safe spot for an Oscar win too now. There are other known actors in here like Cornish, Ivanek, Dinklage, Hedges, Hawkes etc. But it really is McDormand's film for the most part and I can see why they did not put Rockwell in lead. Still, a shout-out to my man Woody Harrelson who is having another fantastic year with this one and his turn in The Glass Castle. We talked about that one on another occasion already.",

Of course Frances McDormand is in it. As it's her kind of movie and plot. It has a Cohen brothers feel to it. This movie somewhat reminds me of ""Out of the Furnace"" but not as dark and honestly not as good in the least. ""Out of the Furnace"" is an example of a masterpiece in the genre, ""Three Billboards"" is a close follower, though much less a thriller. Many have said the editing is ""flawless"" in this movie. As far as continuation of situations and scenes, it is. But, As a horror writer and director, what stood out to me IS some poor editing in other aspects. You know, muting some dialog or the second layer of sound but you can still clearly see peoples mouths moving.. I get the director tries to angle the shots so the mouths are slightly out of view but on many angles the wordless mouths are still seen. I know this happens in pretty much literally every movie but this is one of the ones where it stands out. Aside from that, we are treated with a homey down south feeling. This is not really a movie about finding the person(s) responsible, but rather the actions and consequences of ones actions to a devastating event. Its a story about hardened greif and making the right choices. Honestly, I don't understand why everyone is rating it so high but it still doesn't deserve a low rating either. It certainly isn't worthy of its 8.3 imdb rating. I'd say its more of a 7 or 7.1",

No matter how bad things are and how awful someone may appear to be, there is always the chance that there is some redeeming quality and this film brings that out. Frances McDormand is nothing short of amazing. There is absolutely no way she can't win an Academy Award for Best Actress for this role if there is any justice at all out there. It is a great performance, one of the best any actress has ever given and despite the Academy's recent penchant for giving awards strictly based on political correctness (or simply nominating Meryl Streep for whatever drivel she's been in that year), they can't ignore it and not give her the award. And Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell both deserve serious award consideration for their performances. They too are great as are the rest of the stellar cast.

505,21 January 2018,jboothmillard,9," Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","I was surprised by the amount of bad language featured in just the trailer for this movie, from this I was already wanting to see it, then more so when it was getting nominations during Awards Season, I was hoping for an interesting tragicomedy, from writer and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, The Guard). Basically teenager Angela Barnes (Kathryn Newton) was raped and murdered seven months ago, her mother Mildred (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Frances McDormand) is grieving, but also angry at the lack of progress in the investigation. Driving towards her town, outside of Ebbing, Missouri, she passes three unused billboards, she makes enquiries to Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones) at the company that rents them. She pays for them to read, in sequence, ""RAPED WHILE DYING"", ""AND STILL NO ARRESTS?"", and ""HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY?"" The billboards upset the townspeople, including Sheriff Bill Willoughby (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Woody Harrelson), who the third billboard refers to, and officer Jason Dixon (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Sam Rockwell). The fact that Willoughby suffers from terminal pancreatic cancer adds to their disapproval, Mildred and her depressed son Robbie (Lucas Hedges) are harassed and threatened, but she stays firm, to Robbie's disappointment. While Willoughby is sympathetic to Mildred's frustration, he thinks the billboards are an unfair attack on his character. Dixon is angry at Mildred's lack of respect, he threatens Red, and arrests her friend Denise (Amanda Warren) for insignificant possession of marijuana. Mildred also receives a visit from her abusive ex-husband Charlie (John Hawkes), who blames her for the death of their daughter. Willoughby brings Mildred in for questioning after she has an altercation with her dentist, she injured him with a drill at the clinic. During the interview, Willoughby coughs up blood, against medical advice, he leaves the hospital to spend time an idyllic day with his wife Anne (Abbie Cornish) and daughters, before committing suicide with a gunshot to the head. Before he killed himself, Willoughby wrote several suicide notes for people, including one to Mildred, in which he explains that she was not a factor in his suicide. Willoughby has also secretly paid to keep her billboards up for another month, amused at the trouble it will bring her, a stranger (Brendan Sexton III) soon threatens her in the store she works. Dixon reacts to the news of Willoughby's death by assaulting Red and his assistant, the new chief and Willoughby's replacement Abercrombie (Clarke Peters) witnesses the attack and fires Dixon. Mildred is devastated when passing the billboards to find them on fire, an arson attack, meanwhile Dixon hears that there is a suicide note for him back at the police station. Still in possession of the keys, Dixon enters the police station at night to read the note, which advises him to let go of hate and learn to love so he can achieve his dream of becoming a detective. Dixon is unaware that Mildred is retaliating to destruction of the billboards by tossing bottle bombs at the station, she assumed the building was unoccupied, Dixon escapes the burning building, throwing out Angela's case files, but suffers severe burns. Mildred's acquaintance James (Peter Dinklage) witnessed the incident, but provides Mildred with an alibi to the police, claiming that they were on a date. Dixon is discharged from hospital and goes to a bar, whilst there he overhears the man who threatened Mildred in the store bragging about an incident similar to Angela's murder. Dixon notes the man's car licence plate, he scratches the man's face, provoking a fight, but removes the man's skin from his nails, as a DNA sample to investigate if he had any part in Angela's murder. Meanwhile, Mildred accepts the offer from James to go on a real date, as a thank you for the alibi, but this is spoiled when Charlie enters, with his 19-year-old girlfriend Penelope (Samara Weaving), he admits to burning the billboards, Mildred instructs Charlie to treat Penelope well and leaves. Abercrombie informs Dixon that the DNA sample does not match DNA found on Angela's body, and that the man was on military duty aboard at the time of the murder. Mildred and Dixon conclude that the man must be guilty of some other rape, so they plan to drive to Idaho, carrying a gun, on the way, Mildred confesses to starting the police station fire, Dixon replies without surprise, they both have reservations about their mission, but agree to decide what to do on the way. Also starring Kerry Condon as Pamela, Sandy Martin as Momma Dixon and Christopher Berry as Tony. McDormand gives a brilliant performance as the divorced mother, who tests our sympathies, bankrolling an ad campaign to find her daughter's killer, Rockwell is also fantastic as the dim-witted cop with issues, and Harrelson does well in his time onscreen as the happy-go-lucky sheriff trying to justify himself, whilst also suffering a deadly disease. This is a clever mix of both the funny and the tragic, the high amount of foul language and one-liners are what get the right amount of chuckles, but it is also poignant in its approach to grief, emotional reactions, and other hard-hitting material, it is both sad and funny, a marvellous black comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Score for Carter Burwell, Best Original Screenplay for Martin McDonagh, and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film, Outstanding British Film of the Year, and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, and Best Editing, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Original Score.

511,3 January 2018,Troy_Campbell,7, Unpredictable and moving tale of grief.,"Employing black comedy to explore how a mother mourns for her viciously murdered daughter is not the way most filmmakers would tackle such a tough subject. But subversive UK writer-director Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) is not like most filmmakers. Taking the path less travelled at every opportunity, McDonagh confounds expectations by showing the uncomfortable, unfiltered actions of those trying to come to terms with such a heinous crime. There are no melodramatic, heart-string pulling moments of Hollywood sentimentality here, just pissed off people looking for answers wherever they can find them. The rawness doesn't always work, with a couple of otherwise affecting scenes stumbling due to awkward climactic gags; however, the dark humour (and stubborn aversion to anything resembling normality) successfully turns the film into something of a modern Greek tragedy, and it's compelling viewing. The cast are on point too. Frances McDormand will surely garner an Oscar nomination for her tour de force turn as Mildred, the deceased's mother who'll stop at nothing to get justice, while Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson are captivating as two cops with different approaches to the job and their community. Visually it's solid without being overly memorable, but McDonagh and cinematographer Ben Davis do manage to construct an audaciously long and unbroken tracking shot that is breathtaking in its brutality, and an (extremely) early contender for sequence of the year. An unpredictable tale of grief that eschews mawkishness in favour of frankness, Three Billboards is an amusing look at how unfair and crappy life can occasionally be.",

I mean clearly Three Billboards is 2017's surprise. It's got some of the year's best performances, from Sam Rockwell's foolish, racist, corrupt and resentful Officer Dixon to Woody Harrelson, who's proving that 2017 was his year after good performances in both ""War for the planet of the apes"" and ""The edge of seventeen"" then ends the year with this sensational performance of a beloved parent and respected chief of police confronted by an angry, grieving mother played by the incredible Frances McDormand, seriously words can't describe this woman and her performace. Besides, the supporting cast, including Lucas Hedges, John Hawkes and Peter Dincklage, was stunning although it had little sceen time.
And what can I say about writer and director Martin McDonagh's work other than complete. The screenwriting was flawless and the events were unpredictable in a way you would jump of your seat. And eventhough the film was about grief, anger and vengeance, the script has got plenty of funny moments which were all effective.
I can only think of a single flaw in the whole movie which was an unsuccessful use of CGI, otherwise, I think it would've been perfect.",

526,6 December 2017,stankactorman,6, Mildly amusing at best,"THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI: I have mixed feelings about this one. Mildred Hayes' (Frances McDormand) daughter was brutally murdered seven months ago with no suspect in custody, so she rents three abandoned billboards with a message directed at the town's sheriff for failing to solve the crime. Woody Harrelson has been doing some wonderful work lately and he can add Three Billboards to the 'Excellent' column. He shines as the sheriff giving an in depth performance and stealing the picture from McDormand who's performance is pretty limited and comes off as the poster child for looking stoic. There are a lot of shots of her looking stoic. A lot. Her emotions run the gambit from A to C. The town's police department is a few pieces short of a full set. The premise is interesting - up to a point, and starts to drag and feels pretty long for the story it's telling. It tries to be humorous in places, but it's mildly amusing at best. I found the ending to be somewhat less than satisfying. I can't wholeheartedly recommend it. Score: 6. Don't go. Meh",
527,30 December 2017,sanjidparvez,9, The pain underneath the rage,"No parent in this world deserve to loss a child by an unspeakable tragedy or a brutal crime but when they does, not every tragedy teaches us tolerance and not everyone can get to channel their grief & anger through an unorthodox way like Frances McDormand's Mildred did in this emotionally moving dramedy. And as we know the world is far more complex & unpleasant place than most celluloid projections but it takes a remarkable storyteller & filmmaker to convey that in a convincing manner and Martin McDonagh did this wonder in his latest and this year's one of the best films here. When the little town almost starts to forget about the vicious rape & murder of her young daughter, the aggrieved mother Mildred Hayes rents the three abandoned billboards near her home to protest over the lack of progress in the investigation. This leads to pressure on the townsfolk's favorite chief (beautifully played by our favorite Woody Harrelson), resulting anger from his loyal officers, and so on down the line. This is a darkly funny, yet a very profound film where most of the major characters were flawed by their decisions or actions, torn apart inside by grief or frustrations and that made it so grounded & compelling. Almost every actor in their assigned role did justice to the solid & neatly written scripts where the character developments turned out one of the most strongest elements of this movie. McDormand on the lead delivered clearly an Oscar worthy performance, she was so great with her character's internal language...time to time slowly revealing the pain underneath the rage was something so stunning & compelling to watch that I haven't seen in most of the acclaimed & major films of recent years. Sam Rockwell just nailed his supporting role of Dixon, a small town racist police officer, the development & along the way the changes in his character were another striking part of the film. Not just being a fan of McDonagh's IN BRUGES (2008), I think this is the best film of the year that really deserve some major recognition in coming award season.",

He has made the transition from writing plays in Ireland, to somehow having the ear to write dialogue for American actors. Frances McDormand is the star here, and she should be preparing her acceptance speech for the upcoming Academy Awards. She is Mildred Hayes, a divorced mother whose teen daughter has been raped and murdered on the side of a desolate road. The slow moving, Mayberry like police department is not exactly Scotland Yard. Mildred has the inspiration to rent three billboards with the messages of raped while dying, still no arrests, and how come Chief Willoughby? The chief is played by Woody Harrelson, and he matches McDormand scene for scene. The film is violent, funny and has a deep, dark cynicism throughout. McDonagh shares a verbal style similar to Quentin Tarantino, my other current favorite filmmaker. It is amazing what can be done with a relatively small ($12 million) budget. It was money well spent.",

It's cinematic landscapes, it's seemingly endless time and simplicity, it's atmosphere of the forgotten. Ebbing Missouri has all this. It also has Frances McDormund in all her powerhouse, scene chewing majesty. She's not alone though, the cast here is fantastic! Absolutely, razor sharp, gut punchingly brilliant. This is a serious story though, about rape, murder, injustice, power, corrupt institutions and family values, it's not light hearted whimsy. But make no mistake, if you get into trouble, you want McDormund in your corner. Look up badass in the dictionary and you'll be greeted with a picture of 'Mildred Hayes' staring back at you, ready to deliver a line that will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up so far, you'll give the nearest deranged hedgehog a run for its money. All this makes this imminently watchable, with a slew of complex characters living in that aforementioned simple world, every scene delivers beautifully with not a single wrong turn. The script is dynamite, one amazing line after another, ""You do not allow a member of the public to call you fuckhead in this station house"" or ""This time, the chick ain't losin"". Whether it's the unusual verbal dexterity of Rockwell or the facial inferences from Harrelson, despite the seriousness of the crimes surrounding this story, the black humour delivers epic vistas of light and it's absolutely glorious!",

She is supported by admirable performances from Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson , Abbie Cornish, and Peter Dinklage. All of them give a fine performance but it's Rockwell's role as a tortured cop that leaves a lasting impression on you well after you are done with the movie.

However after 30 minutes of watching this movie in the theater I got up and walked out because all I could do is sit there and anticipate when the next f word or c word would come into play. I have a lot of respect for these actors and I was anticipating much more from them. I think this movie would have been okay even as a PG-13 it would have drawn just as many people without the nasty rotten dialogue and the vulgar profanity. I personally don't know anybody in real life that speaks the way that these characters spoke within this movie to each other within their family etcetera just doesn't make any sense. I don't know why movies these days have to have that kind of vulgarity within the movie to make it a good movie doesn't make any sense to me even the PG-13 movies nowadays have at least one f word many of them why I don't know doesn't make the movie better.

Basically, after seeing all these so called comical movies, it's been a long time when a movie with real humans, with real human issues, real human tragedies to watch is a feast. I believe the major set back for this movie was, when the director decided to give it a black comedy genre. Basically, this could be as good as Francis McDormand Fargo, but I believe she still should win Oscar for her performance in this movie too. This movie shouldn't treat as black comedy. Everything about this movie, cinematography, direction, acting especially all the leading characters, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell and of course the very best Francis McDormand did an awesome job. Except with a few major flaws, first and foremost the comedy part of the movie, there isn't anything wrong in few dialogues, but labeling it black comedy for me took away the essence of this movie, this movie could be very, very tragic. Second, it could be possible that a racist cop could have a change of heart from a dead Supervisor letter, but practically not possible. So, if both characters allowed to grow and Woody character instead of just letter showed his love by his actions, could have made it more believable. Overall, the movie was really awesome and one of the best so far in 2017, especially amongst all those humans animated super hero movies. Before this I really like Jackie Chan The Foreginer.",

It has people, and these people hold REAL emotions and act upon these emotions in an often brutal and shocking manner. Even characters who share one minute of screen time are well developed and enjoyable to just simply observe.

So when Dixon responds to the place with sands comment by saying ""that doesn't narrow it down"" the director is making a point. Still, I don't get the gift shop threat.

These are quibbles though, this is a movie that matters, art versus simple entertainment. You feel the director's power and choices here. Oh, btw, the Guardian hit on this movie that it doesn't properly address African american issues properly is a category error, poorly reasoned and almost purposely obtuse in it's analysis.

One day Mildred drives past three billboards on a quiet road outside town; it doesn't look as if a new advert has been but up in decades. She goes to the advertising agency in town and tells them she intends to hire all three for a year. Her three adverts say: 'Raped While Dying', 'Still No Arrests?', and 'How Come, Chief Willoughby?'. This immediately gets the attention of the police; Willoughby tries to explain that he has done everything he can but the killers DNA doesn't match any on any national database and there are no other leads, he also tells her he has terminal cancer. His deputy, the violent and bigoted Officer Jason Dixon is angrier and starts threatening Mildred and those close to her. Other townspeople don't like being reminded of the incident and side with the police. As tensions rise things get dangerous and people get hurt... but will it bring Mildred any closer to getting justice for her daughter?",

580,25 January 2018,Alexander_Blanchett,8," Great performances and characters, but flawed","Its a good movie. Excellently acted and with a lot of good symbolism and a strong message. But it is sadly also a flawed film. I liked it and i would watch it again at any time as it was enjoyable, tense and had a lot of grew character development and dark humor. And here is the first problem. The story itself was incredibly serious and were the characters and while I do not mind dark humor in a heavy weighted film like this, here it was a bit too much, sometimes Martin McDonagh lost himself in that and it often felt like he did several scenes or made several decisions just for the sake of the humor.Another flaw the film had were some lose ends and some weird decisions. Now you have a great character like the one Woody Harrelson plays. You build him up extremely well just to kill him randomly off after less than half the film, just because you don't really know where to head with that character or because it doesnt serve any more purpose. Sure there are some critical moments of the film that are still influenced by that character after his death, but still, it felt weird. 
Other than that it was a great film that served as a showcase for some of the best performances of the year. First you have Frances McDormand who turns into one of this years most memorable and outstanding performances. She really becomes he role and you feel that hatred and broken heart she has. Great performance and one of the most perfect casting decisions in a long time. Woody Harrelson as mentioned was also good and had a great character. The Oscar nomination he received for it overrates the performance a little though. Sam Rockwell is definitely the stronger supporting role. What a character! And I love the way they developed him, which was unexpected and felt so real and good, because although it was hard to like him, you still kind of felt sorry for him. Wonderful performance. Abbie Cornish was the weakest link of the film. While Rockwell, McDormand and Harrelson were perfect casting coops, she was not. Totally miscast. Good to see John Hawkes and Peter Dinklage in significant supporting roles. Lucas Hedges was all right and I really liked Caleb Landry Jones who gave one of the best performances of his career. Great score, great atmosphere. A very good and watchable movie.",

When the local police makes no progress, she decides to take things into her own hands and upsets everyone in the little town of Ebbing along the way, especially through the provocative red billboards asking questions that sheriff Willoughby(Woody Harrelson) isn't really trying to solve the case at all. The movie turns into a gallery of colorful characters, from the man who rents Mildred the billboards, to James (Peter Dinklage), a midget who put Mildred into her place at a dinner date that wrong. Although it's Sam Rockwell's cop Dixon who a wins you over quite easily, it's his beer-drinking mother who is left the biggest impression on me as the archetype of white trash almost bordering on comedy.",

592,6 March 2018,eagandersongil,8, Impedoso and visceral,"""Three Adverts for a Crime,"" a visceral film that tinkers with the viewer's entrails, blending comedy, drama, and suspense, the film is both ponderous and intriguing, full of social criticism and great acting and directing. best film among the nominees of ocar the category of ""best film"". When we talk about the script, something that awakens our attention, we expect the script to be adapted, but we are surprised to know that it is an original script, which makes the film even more interesting, since it opens many margins for the good director and screenwriter Martin McDonagh, telling the story of a mother indignant at the death of her daughter unresolved by the police, the film creates a context, and within it inserts its characters, some very caricature, but all very deep, or at least with some development, in addition, the long builds characters to then break, weaken and raise them again. The film talks about racism, violence, abuse of authority, homicide and domestic violence, of course, a pure feeling of impotence to be fought, the film is a machine gun for criticism, even though they are all exaggerated in absurd contexts. it is no longer a critical movie. Technically, the film is very good, with a greater emphasis on its great editing, composition of scenes, and great angles, open, with planes sequences, traveling, the camera of the film behaves perfectly, in addition to a photograph that warm, remembering a good old western. Frances McDormand is completely amazing, frightening and crazy, the character scares, and makes the viewer buy his idea, besides showing his sweet and ferocious moments, the other highlight goes to Sam Rockwell, who for me is the best character of the film, a character broken by nature, a class on how to build an antagonist, without vanity or modesty, Woody Harrelson too, is charming and captivating, even having little screen time. Finally, ""Three ads for a crime"" is not perfect, far from it, has problems, has scenes explained that do not need to be explained, has moments that is disconnected with the context that created, but still, it is a very good movie .",

A very black comedy about a small-town community consumed by grief and hatred, it works at the micro-level. But is it actually a portrait of small-town American life, and if so, how did things get so bad? I spent the first half wishing it was based on a true story; as pure fiction, it's hard to assess if it has anything real to tell us, or if it isn't just some imagined fantasy of the monstrous nature of life out in the sticks. I follow some American blogs where some commenters talk about the hostility they feel whenever they venture into the so-called Heartland of their country; but the film doesn't have anything to say about how things may have gone so wrong. I prefered the second half, where it becomes a subtler (though familliar) story of the slow journey to redemption undetaken by its protagonists.

616,9 March 2018,bbewnylorac,6, Could have been much better,"The camera loves Frances McDormand, and she gives a riveting performance as the angry, very stubborn and half crazy Mildred Hayes. Many of the things she does in trying to bait the police into reopen her daughter's murder case are almost understandable, if a little mad. But she later crosses the line morally and legally. Like drilling her dentist's finger. And destroying the police station. And yet she isn't arrested. Why not? Similarly, Sam Rockwell's police character is clearly insane, committing all sorts of crimes, and yet he goes largely unpunished, because it suits the plot. The change in his character he undergoes later is completely unbelievable. He's been Mildred's evil nemesis, and now he's her friend? The ending is quite underwhelming.
I found the nasty comments about the dwarf character, played by Peter Dinklage, offensive. The characters make joke after joke about how unattractive and freakish he is. In the 21st century, aren't we past being that nasty?
I guess they were trying to be daring but no, it was just mean.
The scenery in the film was lovely and the direction was good. Writer and director Martin McDonagh is clearly talented. It's just that he seems to rely on swearing and unnecessary violence to make an impact.

It does not mean that their work is worthless, but incomplete and therefore somehow depreciated. The usual excuse is ""I leave viewer (or reader) to come to its own conclusions"", meaning ""I do not know what to do"". This also happened with this movie. Outstanding writing and performances, immersive story, brilliant direction and editing and then it abruptly ends. It left me angry and wanting more where there's nothing. I saw this with Tarantino, read in Murakami's books and so on. I still do not understand why do people start something they cannot finish and why not make it ""a nice round whole circle"". It started (and went on) with verve and ended in frustration. It just became interesting, for God's sake! However, the part that I watched (meaning the whole movie) is truly great, deserving all the credits it may get. That part I strongly recommend. Remember ""Prestige"" and what it means?

However, the ending is abrupt and it could have kept going for a bit longer.",
645,2 June 2018,adam-may-bower,10, The Best Film of 2017,"'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is undoubtedly the best film of 2017, due to its gripping storyline, stellar acting and witty screenplay.
Frances McDormand leads out this film with a tour de force performance that proves she is one the best actresses working today, and that she should definitely win her Academy Award for Best Actress. Her tough, yet broken character is brought to life and McDormand essentially steals every scene she is in. Not only is McDormand great in this, but pretty much every cast member does a superb job in their, with a special mention to Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson and Lucas Hedges.
The unique plot of this film causes it to stand out to other films in its genre and is gripping the whole way through. The ending of the film may have left some viewers dissatisfied and wanting more, but I perceived it as being the perfect kind of ending; it concludes the story while also continuing on the lives of the characters. Kind of how the end of this story is the beginning of a new one.
Throughout the film, there is never a dull moment and will keep its viewers on edge. It's underlying themes of racism (and the way this film approached it) has stirred some controversy and deemed problematic, which I disagree with. Just because it doesn't become a major plot line does not mean it's unimportant or taking the subject lightly. I believe that it was intended to illustrate how racists Rockwell's character is and that was the sole purpose. And that is fine for this film. Additionally, those who protest the transformation of Rockwell's character into a hero have honestly gotten it wrong - he is still an asshole, he is still a bigot, he is still a racist. But he is changing. He hasn't changed, but he is rather in the process of doing so. By the end of the film, we have seen him begin his process of changing and certainly doing good for the protagonist but it still doesn't justify his previous actions and neither does the film try to do so.
The overall atmosphere and tone of the film is extremely gloomy and is balanced out with it's witty (and rough) screenplay that ends up turning the film into an absurd dark-comedy that is ultimately widely entertaining. Who would have thought that Frances McDormand hurling all kinds of insults at a reporter as she drives by, would end up being one of the most entertaining scenes of 2017? Overall, this film is a triumph in every way possible and consequently has become my favourite film of 2017.",

I thought perhaps because of the way the town looked & the language used at first was dating the film in the late 80s. But then someone mentions Google. Who? The overtly racist assaulting felonious deputy who's overtly mentally challenged. Maybe that's WHY it sounded so out if place, (as with The Chiefs wife having a Aussie accent THEN heavy southern one after..) This is not a film that respects your intelligence. Its so over the top I'd say its a dark comedy but its not funny ENOUGH to let all this bad dialogue & manipulative reversal of characters behaviour. Yes people change sometimes but this movie magic character stuff is just NOT realistic. I won't pick the details of the story others will. Its just not what I was expecting from a member of the Cohen Brothers family. THIS IS NOT A COEN BROS FILM! Indeed Frances can play anything and sound honest but what her character does just isn't believable. The Cohens WOULD have had dry irony, this has the WORST stereotypes of everybody in the south & its not even a decent mystery, its a catharsis of revenge. Nice people they are not. Also Everyone is a victim. I just dont believe anything that happens becsuse consequences dont seem to exist. And the bad guy isnt maybe guilty!..Poor Missouri. It gets alot of bad movies made about it! The music always steers you to what you should be thinking also the casting was bad for females. McDormant has range all right! Her & her slippers beat all the acting in every DC comics film. The stars are one each for Sam & Frances. They are great character actors but have skills beyond the material. I love Woody but he wasnt in there long enough to save this either. Oh & Peter Dinkage & the other supporting male cast were great. Material though. Wow. Should I be laughing? Music says no. PS..... Joan Baez in the bar was also just so.....i dunno. The night they drove old Dixie down...really? Maybe we arent supposed to take it seriously.",

663,12 March 2022,tonypeacock-1,8, McDormand casting triumph yet again,"I was not overly taken in initially with the hype this film seems to have gathered. I mean, the premise, title and trailer all failed to provide much anticipation. However I do recommend this film is seen. The performances from the cast are the highlight. The basic plot outline is the grieving mother Mildred (Frances McDormand) whose daughter was murdered quite violently some months before. She seems to think the police investigation has gone a bit dormant. So in order to focus the mind of locally respected police chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) she hires some dilapidated old billboards on a little used road outside the local town of Ebbing, Missouri, USA. McFarland delivers a fantastic performance not only in grief and revenge but a black humour. Harrelson starts the film looking as if he will be an unpopular character but when it is revealed he is dying from cancer he displays a more sympathetic and at times humorous performance. Willoughby is aided by apparently racist cop, Dixon (Sam Rockwell). Rockwell to delivers a great performance as his character turns from low IQ/racist cop to concerned investigator after his sacking and death of Willoughby. I had one major gripe with this film. The debatable ending. Now I prefer more black and white endings. The simplistic film title has now caused mass attention and debate after viewing and for this I commend the film.",

666,6 March 2018,kmfdm10392,7, Great performances in a movie that could - and should - have been so much better.,"My obsession with Frances McDormand quite frankly knows no bounds. I first saw her in ""Raising Arizona"" and followed her through Coen Brothers (and other) movies - mostly terrific and some not-quite-so-good. My obsession with Sam Rockwell is equally obsessive. He is quite possibly my favorite 'not famous' actor working today. I saw the trailer for ""Three Billboards..."" many, many months ago, saw both names and faces and thought ""this is a film I MUST see."" But living in an area surrounded by 'Giving You Only the Latest Block-Buster"" Cineplexes, it came and went in literally one week and I never got the chance. After having seen McDormand AND Rockwell win Oscars for their roles last night I bought the DVD today, thinking ""I WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE."" But I can't say I did. The performances I did love - especially McDormand's. It ranged from explosive rage to intense sorrow, darkly funny sarcasm to obsessive neurosis, self-destructive insecurity to absolutely crippling guilt, tender, matronly moments to ""you gonna F with me??"" bravado . No spoilers, but she absolutely EARNED that Oscar last night. Rockwell did too. My only problem with the film as a whole is the writing. The story itself was gripping, moving, and (again, at times) darkly funny. Having said that, plot holes abound. Watch it, and you'll see what I mean. Also is my issue with the ""terrible characters ultimately very quickly reformed and redeemed without consequence."" IT'S A WORK OF FICTION, I keep telling myself. But the incredibly serious subject matter of the film doesn't really lend itself to that sort of suspension of disbelief one would take into, say, a Science Fiction movie or the latest Marvel blockbuster. In short, it's a good film featuring some incredible acting (a HUGE shout out to Woody Harrelson, showing range I've never seen from him in ANY movie) that has some serious yet, in hindsight, fixable plot holes and ""whaaaat?"" moments. Then again, it's ""just a movie."" But don't let my opinion sway you from watching it on cable. If you're a fan of any of these actors you will, if nothing else, be drawn into their performances.",

668,3 February 2018,flcntk3-856-986017,10," ""What price justice?""","""What price justice when justice was not served the first-time round?"" This is the question proposed and was explored by the movie through smart black humor and irony. Given we as species are both blessed and cursed with a sense of moral right and wrong and given our world is imperfect where crime do not necessarily meet with their just retributions, we as individuals take matters into our own hand. This is where things get complicated. For one, is there a pay forward system in retribution meaning it is transferrable if the crime fits a generic similarity? Or in the name of justice, equality puts crime of the same into a cesspool of the same where if the retribution is good for the goose, it will also be good for the gander. After all, the satisfaction from seeing justice can also be transferrable from one case to another. It is a question of whether retribution should be case specific, or it doesn't matter. This puts impartiality, the essence of the blindfold on Lady Justice into a new ""funny"" limelight. On irony, there is also the irony of polar difference in attitudes towards crime. The Willoughby's realistic pragmatism that is lined with a fuzzy human touch vs the Mildred Hayes's undaunting iron will and fist of wanting justice served. They are two sides of the same coin because and this may be a surprise for some for in my opinion, they are both pivotal characters showing the two different types of human nature and human nature is what gives rise to our moral awareness, the foundation of justice. The surprise for some lies in my opinion about Mildred Hayes. For though she took center stage in the movie, she is not the protagonist of the show. The real protagonist of the show is Dixon. The catharsis that came to him, which literally changed him through a ""baptism of fire"" is when his potential of being good is acknowledged by his best buddy and mentor, Mr. Willoughby in the letter that he wrote him. Of course, later, the orange juice from the mangled Red Welby also helped to seal a new-found faith in the good side of humanity for him. As to whether justice is transferrable or not, or whether the true culprit of the heinous rape crime against Mildred's daughter is apprehended or not is relatively immaterial for both Mildred and Dixon will have some time after the end of the movie to talk about these things on their way to Idaho.",

His Dixon is a complex stereotype. On one hand he's a little mentally challenged and very angry policeman, on the other - a person with principles. The way he is portrayed blew my mind. Sam makes it special and he steals every single minute. Woody on the other hand has more impact on the storyline, especially in the beginning.

THREE BILLBOARDS is one of the most powerful and thought-provoking films I've seen in a long time. Director Martin McDonagh has delivered an incredibly raw and real movie. His directing and writing are both frankly awesome! He directs an absolutely brilliant cast but also writes an amazing script. THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI is a masterpiece in dramatic writing. It's a very talky script, almost like something from the Cohen Brothers but carries real emotional weight and grit. There is room and backstory for every single character and the film becomes perfectly fleshed-out. Obviously, this was a film about a mother's search for justice but it was more about grief and how people deal with loss, it's also a powerful reminder that there are thousands of stories just like this and (I think) urges that we take care of eachother. The film was about as raw and real as you can get, in a disturbing and quite depressive way. It's no walk in the park, but the way in which the story is told is just SO powerful and moving. The plot is simple, but keeps an even pace and DOES grip. You get a perfect look at each character and how they feel and think. This however, is totally in debt to the jewel of a cast and I have chosen the three main standouts: Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson. ",

Before social media, you needed to put your message on billboards to really put yourself relentlessly out there in people's faces. The movie has all the essential elements - a flawlessly written tale, award-worthy acting, and beautiful cinematography and editing. It is both eccentrically funny and tragically sad at the same time, but manages to make so many philosophical points about crime, justice, bigotry, hypocrisy, ignorance, death, and grief. Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell, and Woody Harrelson create three larger-than-billboard characters whose lives become angrily and hilariously entangled over an unsolved murder.

There were many moments where the film could have simply ended, albeit on a much better note, rather than extending it far too long, and creating unanswered questions the answers to which are essential to the main storyline. In my opinion, the film needed to be shorter or longer - either not have brought about new issues which were not explored sufficiently in the first place (shorter), or alternatively, extending the film a bit more to demonstrate the consequences of the character's respective actions (longer).

Performances from Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell, and Woody Harrelson each bring a blend of love, hate, grief, loss, and a profound sense of humor. Frances McDormand is a shear Tour De Force from beginning to end as you can never forget the look and feel of a grieving mother wanting answers by any means necessary. With the case of Sam Rockwell, he brings along the humor, but also shows his recklessness as someone wanting respect and to show he has a power that people should respect.

It rivals Blade Runner 2049 in sheer greatness. There were so many moments in Three Billboards that genuinely surprised me. It was truly refreshing seeing a movie as unpredictable as Three Billboards. Perhaps the best part of the film, however, are the characters. The performances from pretty much all of the actors in this movie are fantastic. Frances McDormand gives an absolutely spectacular performance in this film (Probably the best performance of her career). And Of course, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Peter Dinklage, and Caleb Landry Jones were fantastic in this movie as well. However, there is one actor in this film who did pretty poorly in my opinion, which was Lucas Hedges. His performance was pretty bad in this film, but luckily he really wasn't an important character, so his performance didn't hinder my overall thoughts of the film. But it's not just the performances that really make these characters great; the way these characters are written is absolutely genius! I genuinely cared about every character in this film. There were some characters that I never expected to care about and sympathize with by the end of it. Each character has a brilliantly written arc that blends perfectly with the pace of the film. Three Billboards is a film worthy of the Oscar it is nominated for. I highly encourage you to go see this movie as soon as you can, before it stops showing in theaters.

This one seems to be about a small town where police and angry citizens can be as foul-mouthed and violent as they like without legal consequences. In real life, where I come from, there are always legal consequences to violent behaviour. I didn't find any of it funny and I found a lot of it really stupid and pointless, like when Mildred fire-bombed the police station. There was also no good reason for Willoughby to shoot himself in the head, either. What a cowardly and mentally cruel thing for a cancer patient to do to his family. And the one person I honestly wish Dixon had shot was his drunken, narcissistic mother just to shut her up for once and for all! And then there was the ridiculous ""phone rang"" ending.

Good acting overall by the cast. The development of story, the pacing, the hurdles, music, everything gets along. There is hope afterall. Whenever the film is about the process of grief. It brings me back to the question. How to actually process it. Yes the grief was not our mistake/own doing, but how we deal with the process of grief is. It doesnt solve anything for the process. Different people grieve differently. How is one better than the other. The regrets people have, not listening, not talking last time, saying things they dont mean, not seeing and everything that happened, it doesnt help but further adds to the griever. But can we forget. Maybe time helps dwindle some of the memories, but things like these, we cannot. Hope is there afterall. Maybe in a better world these things wont happen ( the justice system and the police system needs to be burned to the ground then raising it back from the ashes, because the current system doesnt work it favours evil).

Dixon escapes from the fire and truly understands Director Willoughby 's expectation of himself when he knows about alien sexual assault When the author could not enforce the law, he put down the lost badge. The second is self-redemption. Dixon met Reed in the hospital. Reid still put the orange juice beside the bed; he and his mother became allies and went to Iowa, but said ""not really"". They did not find the murderer in the end, but they achieved their liberation. The third is personal salvation. Every character is torn and distorted. Mildred, whose marriage is unfortunately incompatible with children, is extremely stubborn; the only thought in the family is still Dickson, who wants to eliminate the old mother of color He misunderstood what the director thought ""help"" and threw Red downstairs. He was unruly and discriminated against black people. Willoughby director he could not find the truth and could not bear the pain of illness, and chose to commit suicide to avoid everything; but Mildred is persistent It was the nationals who valued sexual assault. At the end of the restaurant, he dropped the wine bottle that he was going to smash to his husband; Dixon went to Iowa with Mildred in order to get the criminal DNA and endure the beatings; Director Willoughby and Mildred talked about ""baby"" after hematemesis; they were all marginal characters in the play, each representing their own injustice, representing the injustice of the United States against people of color; the arrogance of law enforcers and the distortion of personal character, but in the end they Have achieved self-salvation. The characters they are in are tragic, but they hide the tenderness of tenderness everywhere. They did not find the murderer but gained self-liberation. So it is more like a warm farce.
The first impressive segment was that the black director appeared to be expelled. The suppression of people of color in the southern United States has had many metaphorical ironies in shaping Dixon. In the former case, he suppressed Mildred by suppressing people of color, so he did n't want to solve the case. After the death of the chief, he threw Reid out of the window in order to ""revenge"" the chief. He roared at the black man at the door of the police station. The chief appeared the first step to dismiss Dixon, and he also received a letter from the chief after expelling Dixon. At the same time, because of the black chief's relationship, he had to enter the police station late at night to see that the letter was just attacked by Mildred's fire. . These are no coincidences, but the deliberate design of the screenwriter, which suppresses the black people to appear from the black people to change characters, and finally puts the police badge in front of the black people.
The second episode is Mildred 's accidental payment of no money to pay rent. Reed actually compromised here. He gradually began to fear the intimidation of the law enforcers. At this time, the occasional amount of money made Reid unable to refuse. Who knows that this money was also sent by the law enforcers After renewing the rent, the Commissioner passed away, and the billboard was burned. Combining a high degree of contradiction, and finally cracking one by one absurdly, the billboard was actually burned by her ex-husband, and it was the victim of the billboard who continued the money. Tossing and turning, unexpectedly, breaking the audience's imagination, meaning.",

782,28 January 2018,lale-ba,8, ALMOST PERFECT,"There are still some great ideas left in Hollywood, followed by some great actors and great directors. And sometimes, all of those people get combined together in something called a great drama about a mourning mother of a murdered daughter that decides to rock the small community in Ebbing, Missouri to its foundations in an attempt to restart the police investigation that is tapping in one place for months by criticizing the local law enforcement by leasing three billboards just outside the city limits.
On that road, magnificent Frances McDormand will receive some fierce (best Sam Rockwell in years) and some moderate opposition (always reliable Woody Harrelson), while one of the most gifted directors of the younger generation (McDonagh) discreetly follows the unravelling of this peculiar social experiment. Trademark humor that we saw in ''In Bruges'' will be there as well, and everything will go smoothly till the beginning of the bottom third of the movie. 
There, the script will dissipate, as well as the motivation and actions of the main characters, leading to the disappointing ending of this great movie story.
''Three billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri'' is, beyond any doubt, the best US movie this year, although plagued by some serious flaws and it will represent no surprise if it sweeps the ''Oscars''.",

Things happen (e.g. the appearance of the blue-eyed jerk in the gift shop) that make absolutely no sense and add nothing to the plot.

785,21 March 2018,aaronlbacks,8, Impervious story telling,"This is a great example of taking a simple concept and writing a fully fleshed out and just BANGIN story out of it. Everything just progresses so logically and tightly and cohesively it's just UGH. I just love how each piece was so thoughtfully crafted and selected and how events unfold and characters react. Zero loose strings whatsoever. Rich and powerful symbolism interspersed, but not too overpowering - the story always came first. The way it toys with expectations several times throughout the film on several different story elements. Really this movie should have won best original screenplay over The Shape of Water but oh well it's the Oscars what can you do? And not only all of that, it introduces some of the best and most loveable characters of 2017 - Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand - who won best actress, which I thought should have been given to Sally Hawkins for The Shape of Water but whatever, at least both films won something in some sense), William Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell - who won best supporting actor), Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones), and really the list goes on from here. And it walks perfectly the dark comedy line without ever straying down a road that's too sad or down a comedic part that doesn't forget the morbid overarching plot. The only other film that straddles this gap any better from this year is The Killing of a Sacred Deer - my favorite movie from 2017. The only real detractor from this movie I felt was the way that the characters interacted. It's funny how much inspiration this film takes from Flannery O'Connor - thematically and aesthetically. I love her short stories but I have always had a problem with the characters feeling that they were a little shallow or they knew what the next line someone would say before they said it, or perhaps the feeling they knew they were in a story. It's hard to explain, but her stories have a feel to them. I suppose I'm getting at the fact that this story is so deeply seated in reality, I think it's weird how characters talk like a Shakespearean play in that they aren't only talking to someone on stage, but projecting to the audience. This also contributes to the tone being a little wobbly throughout too. Either way, it's a minor nitpick and doesn't stop this movie from being one of my favorites of the year. Brilliant movie!",
786,29 November 2017,mofilmz-13605,10," Martin McDonough kills the cat: Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri movie review","Grief is an odd feeling to capture in writing, painting, or even in movies. Often times the sad part of grief is so emphasized upon that we forget about the anger, the anxiety and the unease that it carries. Perhaps because anger is associated with ugliness and rage, our heroes don't stay angry for long. They quickly get inspired and fight back to reach the happy ending where skies are once again blue, and grass is green. But anger is as relatable a feeling as hope or love, it clouds our judgments and pushes to limits we cannot imagine. I love Martin McDonough's work so much because ha challenges himself to use all that raw feeling to make art. There are no good or bad characters is Ebbing, they all try to cope with their life in their own ways and it's from depth of these characters (and not boundaries of movie genres) that we get sorrow, empathy and of course loads of dark comedy. The less you know about this feature going in, the better. The movie opens with Francis McDormand driving down a lonely road as the camera follows her from outside of the car. We see her looking up at something in front of her as she slows down, and when the car stops, we see the reflection of an old billboard in the windshield. We see the moment of her decision making all in one simple clever image. No cuts back and forth to clue us as to what she's looking at and of no lazy exposition. She decides to use the billboards to send a message to the chief of police in Missouri, asking what happened to her daughter's murdered. There is a book about how You can write a screenplay that you can successfully sell to Hollywood called ""Save the cat"" which outlines plot points and where the should happen, to generate a certain amount of forced empathy out of you for the characters in the film. You've seen the result in every Marvel movie, every blockbuster and more recently in ""Justice League"" and as fan, I find them to be more and more boring every time. Studios dare not to take risks, and continue to pander to our lowest common denominators as the audience so they can make a buck. My little rant on ""save the cat"" connects to ""Three Billboards"" because McDonough is aware of the audience expectations and he deliberately uses that advantage to surprise us and control our feelings. After all a director is only directing our attention during his film and not what we would like, and expect to see. This self-awareness is a double edged sword, as it can fire back for being too cheesy, to self-referential and too full of itself, but Three Billboards manages to walk the thin line perfectly, and you as the audience are lost in this movie's world because as you feel like you know these characters, and so you care! Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri has the best screenplay of the year, it has the best Female lead and best supporting male in Francis McDormand and Sam Rockwell, it is one of the darkest, and also one of the funniest films I've seen in years. Martin McDonough continues to build and own his tone as a dark comedic writer and my prediction is, very soon, just like the Quentin Tarantinos and Wes Andersons of this world he will be known for his own genre of film. Go watch this movie now! ",

So, for the record, if you didn't like In Bruges or Seven Psychopaths, this film probably won't be to your taste.

You get disappointed everytime they make the wrong decision and you're proud of them everytime they have a breakthrough; learn a lesson. Francis McDormand's performance is devastatingly beautiful and i seriously hope she gets all the awards. It would be a clear 10 for me if not for the ending which left me a bit unsatisfied. It just felt that the heroes had not reached the end of their personal journey yet. I needed maybe one more scene there.",

813,25 September 2021,schwarzbauer-11060,1, How can you screw this up?,"...by being a smug British director/writer who thinks he can repeat the admittedly great ""In Brugges"" in Missouri. I love all of the actors.in the lead roles of this movie: Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, Lucas Hedges. In the hands of the Cohen brothers this would have been a fantasic movie. It starts with an usual premise and skirts all of the usual movie cliches but that's it. Evidently Martin McDonagh thinks Missouri is ""the South"" where people talk with a drawl like they are from the bayou but at the same time quote Oscar Wilde. The wife of the sheriff is just plain awful and can't do an American accent to save her life, not even for one sentence. The landscape is clearly not Missouri but somewhere in the Appalachian mountains in the actual South. The soundtrack is a complete mess and something that would play in no small town nowhere in the US. The dialogue is weird but not in a good way and the overall story struggles for direction for every single minute this disaster drags on. Wonder why people in the middle of the US think Hollywood is out of touch? Just watch this mess of a movie which also features Peter Dinklage... because every Martin McDonagh movie insultingly needs to have a short person in it, it seems. Reminder to self: skip all future Martin McDonagh movies.",

I wouldn't call this a comedy by any stretch of the imagination... is that how people who are saying so, write it off as 'unlikely human behaviour?' Perhaps. 
This is more like the reality of how humans behave, than not. if our anger, rages, horrors, insanities and highly emotional dramas were filmed in the day to day we'd recognise why we have such high crime rates, divorces etc.
Back to the movie: nothing short of brilliant in so many ways. Never, at any point can you take this movie's plot for granted.

the role of dixon's mother is unpleasant but extremely well acted.
on the other hand, the plot twist makes no sense. we see a vicious psychopath boast of killing a girl - almost certainly the daughter - then worry that he was overheard. turns out he is not the killer. ok, novel twist, but if he is just boasting, not the killer, why was he so worried about being overheard? and we see him shockingly violent twice, yet his fingerprints are in no law enforcement database, local or national. clean record? not likely.
why does chief willoughby write detailed letters telling mildred but not his wife that mildred is not responsible for his suicide? the only reason i can see is to set up a scene where the wife is furious at mildred. pretty catty for the kind chief willoughby.
i have seen lucas hedges in 3 films in the past year, and he is least compelling here.
i was not moved by woody harrelson's portrayal. yes, i understood that he was supposed to be a good man and a decent person, but i didn't feel it. clarke peters as the replacement police chief was palpably decent; harrelson was not. seemed like the wrong actor for the role. for a decent police chief, i think of chris cooper in ""lone star,"" a great frances mcdormand film. 
mcdonagh sure enjoys killing off good guys (cf in bruges), but he doesn't do it nearly as well as george r.r. martin.

Trying to explain that for Americans it was a big deal she couldn't get it. For me it is the kind of hypocrisy America has come to the last decades.

Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri stars Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, and Frances McDormand, which is also directed by Martin McDonagh. This is about a woman who decides to post an advertising to let everybody know that her daughter was raped and murdered. I wanted to see this movie for two reasons: One: I like the work of Martin McDonagh, and Sam Rockwell, who I think is an underrated actor. And I watched this movie and it was different from the movies that Martin McDonagh has done in the past like In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths. And those movies had humor as well as a great drama, but this one it doesn't have that much humor to it. There is a little bit of humor, but not much as his other works and I miss that and I wanted to see more of that. Now that isn't to say that this isn't a bad movie. There were moments that were fun to watch and other times where do we need that scene to explain everything. Sam Rockwell and Frances McDormand carry the movie for sure. I think she's a good actress and I haven't seen her in anything in a long time so it was good to see in her in the spotlight. Sam Rockwell is the comedy relief in the movie and the scenes that he's in are fun to watch. You start to hate this character because he's a violent psychopath but later on you start to like him and realize he isn't a bad person.

The more she scolds, the more she has the courage of ""one against the world""; the stronger she is, the lonelier she is. The more desperate she is in her search.

886,9 February 2022,atkinsonlouise-73873,9, The Dark Side Of Grief,"Damn this film was hard hitting. It touches on some heavy themes like loss, murder, racism and grief, but in such a well done way. It's a very human film and while there is no characters to root for, the characters here are ones to get invested in. Frances McDormand is fantastic in the lead role and truly shows the effects of grief on a mother and the emotional reactions it can result in. Her toxic family relationships highlight the pain that her daughters death has caused, but also how her reactions to this pain have caused hurt for those closet to her. Her actions may not be those of a stable 'good' person, but they feel human and they show how she hasn't got over this pain. Watching how the film concludes and her finally coming to terms with her grief, is an emotional moment. Sam Rockwell is brilliant here too, at first as this horrible and bigoted police officer who uses his power to benefit him, with his reactions to trauma affecting others and having consequences of there own. While you don't quite forgive this character by the end, you see he has changed and that maybe he has some humanity after all. Woody Harrleson is the film's moral compass and plays the role well, with his characters death, providing the next step in the story and leading to much of what happens later in the story. The relationship between these three different people, provides the insight into the different ways trauma is dealt with and people eventually finding peace in their grief. The music is pretty good here too and the film is well paced and feels just right in terms of time length. A great human drama and our two main characters are well deserving of their Oscar's.",

The characters build-up isn't enough compare to their storyline, which make it less convincing. The movie got no real story to tell, most things happens just because of the right or wrong circumstances, and the whole movie seems kind of pointless in the end. The directors idea I think was to produce the same kind of atmosphere and bizarre humor as in ''In Bruges'' but instead of letting the story itself be the source of laughter much of the jokes are forced in place (some of it very funny though) I get the feeling that the movie think it's both better and funnier than it actually is.

The main actors did a good job of portraying their characters, even though they become caricatures of stereotypes and therefore lose credibility. It was the script that bothered me the most. It seems to lack a purpose in the storytelling. As a viewer, we are led to believe (or at least hope) that the local police will actually put in the extra effort to solve the case and maybe reach a breakthrough as events unfold. But we never really see them put in the extra effort, except for one short scene with Woody Harrelson. In stead, the story focusses on senseless anger throughout the movie from police, the mother and father and people from the community, that all underline a sense of powerlessness.

924,26 March 2018,jaapeelman,7, Interesting movie with implausibilities and an unsatisfactory ending,"A lot of very high reviews on imdb.com for this movie but it is not as good as it seems.
The storyline is interesting about a mother who rents three bilboards to put up texts in order to force the local police to come into action to investigate the death of het daughter closer.
The sheriff has cancer and has two little daughters but does not much about the case. His deputy Dixon is a real asshole and it is unreliable that he is not fired.
It is also very unreliable that he changes his attitude 180 degrees only because of the letter he receives after rhe suicide of the sheriff.
And than there is the violent ex-husband of the mother and this unpleasant man has a 19-year old good-looking but dumb girl on his side. Yeah, right...
The mother sets the police-station on fire and almost kills the deputy but the new sheriff does not even check het story although she is at the scene of the crime and the obvious suspect.
And than there is the more or less open ending, a phenomenon that you see more lately but what I absolutely dislike!

What bothered me was that these two characters are ultimately ready to kill any man whom they suspect of any crime against anybody - without proof, without trial, just condemn him and kill him. That's as evil as what happened to her daughter. This film teaches that it's okay to behave like this - kill any man you think is nasty.

Many of them are racial jokes aimed at making the audience uncomfortable, like in Get Out, but still... And during the whole movie I felt like it was held back. Acts don't have consequences, no one dies that shouldn't die. And my initial prediction of the movies proved correct : they never catch the murderer, and once you hear about Idaho and their plan to go there, you know the movie will end right here, that there won't be a last act outside Ebbing. The performances of the actors save the movie, and a few scenes are funny. But some characters don't hit home : the son, the 19 year old bimbo, or the replacement police chief.

I thought that all of the pieces were there for this to be a great film, but it fell flat with all of the forced humor. Don't get me wrong, I love dark humor; but the director needed to decide if the movie was going to be a slapstick comedy or a drama, not both.

It was a pretty confident movie, but as was with the case of The Girl In the Train, which I saw a while back, it lacked some sort of zinc to make it more interesting.

951,3 March 2018,Shambala_Elephant,3, Must Do More than Imitate or Mock Violence,"The talented cast and (occasional) idyllic images, not to mention Renee Fleming's beautiful rendition of ""Last Rose of Summer"" save this otherwise pointlessly violent movie. I know: the whole point is to mock violence, indulge violence, comment on our obsession with revenge but also comment on the need for justice. But a movie has to be willing to take a stance and risk sentimentality and risk being moral if it wants to be successful. Over-the-top violence is never funny to my sensibility, and I think it says more about our collective inability to solve our mass shooting problem and pervasive disconnect (preferring social media to real intimacy) than it does the movie's sophistication. When police chief Sam Rockwell knocks the kid off the roof and then goes down to the street to kick him into the hospital, camera's viewpoint where his gun would be holstered, it's disgusting, pointless, and not at all funny to this viewer. That they meet later in the hospital is supposed to function as some kind of double irony and edgy rapprochement, but it's simply exhausting. ",

Okay I admit, I have no friends that set police stations on fire or let themselves be beaten up. Being European I don't even have friends or know any people that own a gun. All true. I still identify with the characters here, their thoughts and emotions. I do not necessarily agree with them but I do understand. That is why I get involved in the story and start to care about the characters.

His structure of glib everyday life individuals that interconnect into a spiral of truths surrounding the death of a local girl (Kathryn Newton) makes it feel almost borderline hopeless, yet humorous in each character's contentious flaws.

Because the background of the story is that the daughter of the hostess was raped but no real tragic event can be found. The development of all the plot of the story is based on this background. Although there are many black humorous elements, they are all In a depressed environment, ridicule life. I described it as a comedy because the development of the characters in the story is towards warmth and reconciliation. In the last scene, Dixon and Mildred went to Idaho to track down the real murderer. The result is no longer important. The important thing is that you will find that their relationship changes, from opposition to cooperation, from evil to good, no relationship is the only one. It is always full of uncertainty. Just like the complex human nature, you can never guess what time humans will perform in what time period. The last line of the movie: Let 's decide on the road, the road of life is to decide one by one, but do n't decide easily, because. What you see may not always be what you imagine, there may be other stories behind it. In fact, I do n't think the film has a very profound theme. It just shows the life situation of ordinary people.

996,14 December 2017,emkay905,10, An excellent piece of tragicomedy,"From the beginning, i realised this movie's focus wasn't on bringing justice for Angela, it was all about these brilliantly crafted characters and their arcs, a tale of redemption with a witty script filled with hilarious one liners by Martin Mcdonagh. I went into this film not knowing anything other than the fact that it's a film that's been getting rave reviews and praise from regular movie goers. I went to a preview screening of this film, and there was a surprisingly great number of scenes in which the audience erupted into laughter. McDonagh has made a great movie here which explores the complexities of life through protagonists who all lack a hero trait. These characters aren't likable, they're all flawed in their own ways but that's what gives them depth and allows us to resonate with these characters. McDough has crafted a beautiful tale of redemption , keeping us emotionally balanced with witty dialogue which made the movie less intense which i personally enjoyed as some parts got rather depressing. The script didn't try too hard in terms of hamfisting jokes into scenes like a marvel movie, its dark humor worked brilliantly and i was thoroughly entertained throughout.
I never cared for finding out who did Angela wrong, i was so invested in the depth of these characters and their arcs that the main goal of the film's plot felt so unimportant in comparison.
This is a very well crafted original movie, with terrific dialogue, i would highly recommend seeing it with no knowledge of the plot like i did. You'll be in for a treat.",

1003,4 May 2020,q-85184,8, The world is barren and the heart is full of flowers,"The character begins with a triangle, Hayes, sheriff and Dixon, all of which maintain a wonderful balance at first. Dixon complained for the police, but the sheriff had to find a way to make peace with Hayes while stopping his subordinates from making trouble. But the sheriff's cancer and final self-determination broke the balance and catalysed everything. This sudden death has become a ""material"" for the people in the town to interpret infinitely. Some people think that it is due to the relief of suffering from disease, but more people think that it is suffering from Hayes' humiliation and pressure, more like a decisive counterattack. At the same time, the death has become a strong internal driving force to promote narrative.
Stable start to shake, balanced start to tilt, one corner of the triangle suddenly collapsed, and the other two ends of the game began. And that set off the two fires. As the confrontation in this story reaches its peak, it happens to be the process of both sides entering each other's heart. The sheriff left a letter to everyone, to Hayes and Dixon. His absence turned into a more obvious presence. A confession full of self mockery and humor from the dead was far more powerful than his futile explanation in his life. At this point, the theme set up in ""the good man is hard to find"" has been diluted. Although it is full of violence, all things have finally subsided. The lines on Hayes's face are no longer rigid, and Dixon is no longer so reckless. The angle began to move towards the resultant force. Just like those two fires, seemingly tit for tat revenge, in fact, they are all misunderstandings. After a series of misunderstandings and violence, they accidentally promote reconciliation and softness.
This unexpected change is closer to the truth of life, self righteous judgment, irresolvable estrangement, unexpected and unprovoked disaster, unexplained dawn. People think that they are on the right path, but they may go astray. They believe that the mountains are poor and the waters are flowing again, but they run into the dark.
There is stupidity and violence in this town, but it's not the inside that the film focuses on. It's all the surface. They are finally peeled off layer by layer. Although there are costs, they have experienced blood and fire, but the final result is actually tempered very softly. It starts with heartbreak and ends with liberation. Everyone has scars, Dixon's on the cheek, Hayes's in the heart, but the two finally look at each other and smile. The ending is destined not to put on another crazy ending, but to ""make decisions on the road"" like life itself.",

I really enjoyed character Sam Rockwell played. He was not only funny but also brilliant (well, maybe not at the begining) . I think that Rockwell did very good job and he deserves an Academy Award.

1019,3 February 2018,oliver_castillo,10, Outstanding. Definitely the best-drama-movie of the year.,"""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri"" is magnificent. Not just because of the original name but because what it has in the inside. It's meaning. This movie is a really symbolic and representative one, with facts that really exist. That's what makes it EVEN MORE glorious, because you feel like this actually is happening and makes you reflect. Also outstanding performances of Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, and Sam Rockwell. I think this is going to be one of those movies that in a future, it is going to be a classic, and it would be passed from generation to generation, like 12 Angry Men, The Godfather, etc.",

I found that viewer/critics wanted to make sense of the film as if it was intended to be a close up of white-dominated town in Missouri. This movie is not about modern culture. This story and the players in it are displaying raw emotions that we all -whether we admit it or not -share. Don't look for solving a murder. Look at humans inside their cosmos. They all are struggling to face death by cancer, murder, bigotry, homophobia, growing up with effed-up parents, and changing times. Frances McDermott is always bringing her best game. Sam Rockwell as Dixon however is a tour de force. I was convinced he was an illiterate closet gay using anger to look like a man. He evolved (I could care less about his sexuality) and is that not worth a star or two? He played his part to perfection and then some. Reminded me of Ben Mendolsohn in Bloodline and Darkest Hour.",

1022,3 December 2017,juribeldman,8, An Amazing Black Comedy,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is the best comedy i have ever seen. A great example of the hollowness of normal comedies and the greatness of black comedies. I have definitely been inspired to watch the two other films of Martin McDonagh and try to check out some of his plays. ",
1023,12 May 2019,walinikita,8, FANTASTIC,"I love a good black comedy, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is precisely that. Humour is perhaps our most essential tool for discussing the dark issues we face in life, and this is a movie filled with Writer/Director Martin McDonagh's trademark dry wit and talent for combining scathing comedy with serious subject matter. Frances McDormand is a terrific lead, full of venom and thinly-veiled bitterness, scowling and sneering at those who wrong her. Her situation is understandable, as is her consternation at what she sees as a slack approach to it from her local police force, which she goes head-to-head with. Brilliant supporting roles are provided by Woody Harrelson and especially Sam Rockwell, who is the quintessential snivelling, ignorant bigot, who is given a chance to grow beyond his raw hatred and finally do some good with his life. The story itself seems to take too many digressions in the 3rd act, but I liked the uncertainty upon which it ended, and the questions it forces the audience to ask. I don't mind a perfectly happy ending it if feels right and fits the tone, and it certainly wouldn't have here. The jokes are, in keeping with the material, harsh and even cruel, but what's being presented is unpleasant, and the movie never tries to lampshade it. It never feels overlong and surprises keep popping out of nowhere. Being a huge fan of In Bruges, McDonagh's cinematic debut, I'm glad to see he is keeping the tradition of highly observant dark comedies alive.",

Luckily there are other opportunities to beside this film. // I wanted the casting to feel real like Nomadland which had me wondering whether they cast non-actors. In 3 Billboards much of the cast felt about as real Missouri redneck as Father Knows Best's family is real. Save Mildred, all the females were thinnish Hollywood attractive. The men are professional theatre types who somehow land in the Ozarks speaking ""movie Southern"" Was that the comedy I keep hearing about?

Those who pan it don't mention that this movie keeps your attention throughout, even when you can't suspend disbelief. The acting is strong; all the leads are commendable. The script is weak; our heroine is a vigilante thug who is never held accountable for her actions. Not realistic. There are too many subplots in this movie and they are unresolved. Too much going on, it is an unfocused mess. When, at the end, when we are led to believe some growth has taken place,.....we are disappointed again.

1050,7 April 2020,mdstudio-75425,5, 3 Billboards Outside of The Twilight Zone,"Actually the Twilight Zone had some mysterious endings that were thought provoking. This piece is a typically 21st Century mystery in that the narrative concludes by simply leaving a question mark floating over one's head. Essentially, this is a presentation of two movies more or less about three billboards. The first half is taut and compelling, promising an unfolding epic saga of potently lurid small town evil. As soon as Harrelson offs himself however, the second misfire of a movie is more or less initiated. The acting is solid throughout, yet the motivations and relationships of the characters start veering toward the absurdly inexplicable for the latter half of the tale. The story provides zero redemption for any of its characters and the crime driven/ whodunnit plot is unresolved. Tensions are established, complications ensue, consequences are implied, only to ultimately fade into an unrewarding denouement. Describing this film as a black comedy is only accurate if you interpret black to mean abstruse and comedy to mean not very funny, especially considering the core of the plot concerns rape and murder, but not necessarily in that order. Finally, our two unlikely heroes cheerfully head off into the sunset, maybe to create some further mayhem in a sequel similarly free of atonement.",
1051,14 May 2020,babyZ2020,8," To understand the diversity of being human, but from the good","I didn't expect this kind of gentle work from the beginning to the end.
The story stems from the death of the hostess's daughter, then the mother rents a billboard to urge the case to be solved, and then others in the town are also involved.
In the end, several protagonists understood each other from the perspective of love. It was not the forgiveness of the Virgin, but the kindness in their hearts made them choose to understand rather than hatred and revenge.
In this story, it is difficult to judge the good or bad of someone. They proceed from their own standpoint and do what they think is right according to their personality. The labels and prejudices when they first met them were ripped off in repeated scolding, tearing, and even arson. Not a strong mother needs to forgive the murderer, not a policeman who beats people, he is unwilling to do justice, and it is not covered with dirty words Zhang is an incompetent father. Of course, there are also non-washable crimes (which must not be forgiven), but, as the sheriff said, kindness makes people calm and calm makes people think. Think about what you should do from a good point of view, and then admit the harm your impulse has caused to others.
I think now the entire rice circle should watch this movie, understood as a multi-faceted person; unless you really start from evil.",

She purchases three billboards to bring the towns attention to the unfinished case. The witty, belligerent, cold-hearted woman you meet in the trailer is truly what you get, though Frances Mcdormand is not the only star of the show. Sam Rockwell (Dixon), Woody Harrelson (Chief Willoughby), and Caleb Landry Jones (Red) are not far behind. Already sporting some nice golden globes, I see Oscar noms (and possibly wins) in the near future for some of these roles. Needless to say, this was so unexpectedly good! I did enjoy Martin McDonagh's ""Seven Psychopaths"" but not nearly as much as I enjoyed ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"". This movie includes the same cold, dark humor, quick twists and unexpected turns but in a much more impactful way.

1059,28 June 2018,mistramicizia,10, Hit me like a truck... and that's in a good way,"By far one of my favorite movies from 2017 (and, truth be told, that year was very good for the movies themselves) which revolves around well written characters and even better written story and scenario. There are no shallow characters and all of them, even minor ones have the depth in their own unique way. To be quite honest, I didn't even expect much from this movie, considering that I wasn't very fond of McDonagh's other feature film (which is quite popular and one of his most famous movie, if not the most known and favorite among many) In Bruges. When I sat in the cinema along with my friend and (apparently) many who knew what to expect, the movie started with its very dark, yet oddly humorous tone, which was present throughout the entire movie (which serves only as an anesthetic to the generally dark and bitter story of loss). The humorous aspect is mostly thanks to probably one of the best written characters in 2017 - officer Jason Dixon portrayed by Sam Rockwell, who was ahead of anybody in The Best Supporting Actor category and definitely deserved this award. I don't think I have seen such a colorful and changeable character in a while. One of the many examples to attest this was one quite loud person in the public who literally wanted that character to die as soon as possible, and then, during a specific scene, which was the key one for Dixon, she literally started crying after seeing a possibility that he may not end up well (or even die). What a change of character! Kudos to Sam Rockwell. Frances McDormand was also among those who made this movie, with her somewhat antipathetic, yet persistent appearance, as a ""lady who never smiles"", which is, as far as I remember Fargo (the film), a role quite opposite to the one there, but still Oscar-worthy performance. Of course, the other Oscar (for her) was also deserved without a debate. So, as the film ended, I felt like a truck hit me, so many mixed feelings prevail, and definitely this movie made me think about it for a while and definitely would recommend to everyone. I felt rather displeased that Martin McDonagh didn't win in at least one out of three categories (billboards?), because he sure did deserve that.",

Amazing acting not only by McDormand but also by Harrelson and the superlative Rocwell.
A movie that everybody should watch, not because the movie deserves to be watched but because people deserve the chance to watch such a masterpiece once in a their life.
It deeply touched me.

1088,7 March 2018,Bas1976,6, A non specific movie about a tragedie,"While I have a been a fan Of Frances McDormand since Fargo, this movie does however disappoint me to quit an extend.
She plays her role well, a feisty women who wants to take matters in to her own hands after her daughter is brutally raped and murdered and no one seems to care.
As a parent you can only feel compassion for her rage and determination.
That is the good side of the movie, the not so good is the fact all of the prejudices they want to shove down my throat.
In no particular order these are the ones that irritated me the most:
The black woman/man getting suppressed by the police;
The police is always well represented with bigots;
Pot should be legal;
It is perfectly fine to burn down a police station if you feel they let you down;
It is absolutely necessary to kick teenagers in the groin when they don't answer your question;
And last but not least, you should always compare a priest or pastor with a gang member.

The performances are outstanding, French Macdormand as the mother who seeks justice does not stop at anything hiding her emotions but acting before each stick on the wheel perhaps her decisions are not as correct as neither are those of some secondary actors such as the  police officer impulsive and violent played by San Rockwell, director Martin macdonagh directs this film directly also with his excellent dialogues tinged with black humor and even comics in a very tough drama, but that is the good thing about the director: speaking directly that the characters show themselves as they are with all their miseries. Another outstanding performance is that of Woody Harrelson who seems to be the soul that somehow wants to help in the face of so much violence and barbarism. This film raises many issues, justice by its own hands when there is no answer from who is supposed to protect us, violence and when it is answered only with more violence, because there is a barbarism against the civilized that affects the characters and what to do with our anger on which side to put ourselves after an event as hard as the one that happened to Mildred the character of French.

There is the stereotypical corrupt, angry, super racist police officer and the whole department has racist leanings. The whole town is aware of this officer yet nothing seems to be done about it, which implies the whole town is full of racists. The main characters react, most often in a violent manner with no worry of consequences, rather than trying to communicate rationally. Hollywood reached a new low by having the main character's children call her names so disrespectful that they cannot be repeated without causing my review to be removed.

There is blood, sweat and tears but it retains grace and a poetic quality. The story could have slipped into a tale of revenge, the central character could have been blind and arrogant, but there is nothing so crass in this 2017 masterpiece written by Martin McDonagh. His career is littered with awards and he rightfully picked up an Oscar for this exquisite screenplay.",
1170,26 December 2018,misserinjane,10, A masterpiece that you will never forget,"I went into this movie with different expectations. I never thought I wouldn't enjoy it. I just thought I would be crying most of the way through, also knowing what each scene held due to a lot of movies having a similar plot. I laughed more than I cried at the unknown dark humour that most people would consider inappropriate. To me, it just showed how everyone doesn't deal with certain situations the same way. Every scene had a moment where I was in complete awe. I didn't want it to end. Take away the dark comedy, and you have a grieving mother and family who feel defeated with nothing to lose, you have employees of the law who have a case that finally made them snap. No matter who's side you're on in this movie, they all have an intriguing point of view that makes you understand why they have certain reactions and actions. Frances McDormand May rightfully so have a stand out performance, but it's Sam Rockwell who leaves you with mixed emotions and a ""WOW"" factor. An absolute must see. Buy the movie and download the soundtrack. Even the music score deserves a whole paragraph of its own.",

Fantastic acting. Great dialog. Good storyline.
The characters verbal intercourse is what sarcastic / cynical people think but polite people would never say.
The Bad
This is a dystopic Mayberry with the darkest worst sides of every Andy Griffith character. (Andy, Barney, Crabby old lady, Otis the Drunk as a midget, Opie as a angry teenager . . . 
It is offensive and insulting the way Hollywood portrays middle America.
It was an attempt to be another ""Fargo""
Hollywood portrays middle America as dumb, white, redneck, racist gubbers.
And this movie ended without closure.

Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson give great performances and the screenplay contains some real gems which are the main reasons why you should watch this film. I wanted slightly deeper exploration of certain characters' motives and backstories and I would have liked it if the lead character was less one note but unfortunately this was not to be.

The film squats into vile pain, the very burning embers of grief and derogatory assumptions that shape the very narrative of the movie while unchaining small realities and profound realities through its course.

Many independent films similar to this film tend to distract the audience with unexpected plot twists and ill-fitting celebrities, but this film managed to avoid both tropes. Despite the film consisting of an award winning cast, the casting was superb and no character felt out of place. The plot was outstandingly unexpected, similar to that of a Quentin Tarantino script. As The Telegraph put it, ""Its characters continually defy your burnt-in expectations of what they'd do, and what might be done to them in turn, in a better-behaved, more formulaic script.""

I think the intended point was how commitment and integrity can come with some drawbacks.

1225,20 June 2018,okamiokami,8, Amazing tale of redemption,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a movie about making extreme choices and dealing with the consequences.
As other reviewers noted, character development reaches new heights here.
All characters, no matter how negative they appear, or how badly they behave, get the chance to show their good side.
The movie starts with a pretty grim settings: the mother of a raped and murdered teen-ager is ravaged by guilt and tries to expedite the investigation (a 7 months old case with no leads and no witnesses) by renting three billboards on a secondary road (where her daughter was murdered on her way home) and displaying three (barely) legal taunting signs addressed to the chief of police.
The main characters are all wonderfully cast (Frances McDormand as the bereaved mother, Woody Harrelson as the chief of police and Sam Rockwell as the dim-witted, macho, racist and closet homosexual cop).
The director plays with stereotypes, but the only constant is that in the end almost all are broken. There is decency in every single character: the letters from the grave by Chief Willoughby are particularly touching, and so are the displays of forgiveness by the two characters that (physically) suffer the most in the movie.
All the individuals are given a chance to redeem themselves (and they make good use of it), with the exception of the unspecified townsfolk.
Small town people cannot stick to their own business, so what should have been a direct confrontation becomes a confrontation between factions, with the typical mob behaviour that is so American.
The ending shows that even in the worst possible scenario there is still hope. 
With the rapid decline of our civilisation, we can only believe it's true.",

1238,25 March 2022,roaldth,10, A perfect MOVIE in all capital letters,"There's few movies I'd say brings all the elements on the table without forgetting them through the story. It has a dark comedy that, to me, is perfect, but it doesn't at all overshadow the depressing topic, more that it brings more levity to the story. It respects a harrowing story of a mother that seeks justice to the terrible incident that's happened to her. It also handles the themes of change, that people aren't necessarily all they seem, and that they might change with enough support. There's really nothing negative I could say about this movie, it made me both laugh and cry at the same time. Martin McDonagh has yet to make a bad film. What I also like in McDonagh's casting choices is that he chooses unconventional actors and actresses in his movies, and all of it fits strangely well.

There are films we watch that simply entertain us, take us to another world, another time. Then there are those films that deal with our actually reality, the real world. This is one of those films. It smacks you in the face with the truth about the difficulty of solving some of the most horrific crimes, the pain and guilt of those left behind, and how even the worst if us can surprise you.

Yes! it was really shocking when I saw a woman kicking two school students just because they throw a can to her car's windshield, but I quickly remembered that this movie is doing everything possible to make you say: I didn't expect this to happen.

1267,6 March 2023,peterroryhall,8, Anger and power,"A gruesome murder rocks a small town, leaving no apparent suspects. The film captures the aftermath of the crime from the perspective of a tough, emotionally distant mother. Her character is multi-faceted, initially coming across as unyielding, but as the plot unfolds, her actions reveal a sense of childlike desperation as she seeks answers for the act. This movie boasts a powerful plot that delves into a range of issues, such as race, morality, rape, domestic violence, and the painful grief associated with murder. However, despite the dark nature of the story, the film injects rare but dry humor into the mix, creating moments of levity amidst the emotional fallout. Above all, ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing"" is a captivating exploration of mid western small-town America. The plot is gripping, the humor is sharp, and the performances are top-notch.",

1285,21 December 2017,istumbo,9, One of the best of 2017!,"Martin McDonagh's Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is one of the very best films of the year and a wonderful showcase of actors, writing and direction. 
Frances McDormand stars as Mildred, a woman who knows that the investigation into her daughter's rape and subsequent murder has stalled. Tired of the police dragging their feet, she rents three billboards outside of her home town , each of them asking Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), why her daughter's murder has not been solved.
This leads to people in the town taking sides, events start to unravel and things take very interesting turns that the audience will probably not see coming as Mildred has to take matters into her own hands to find justice for her daughter.
McDormand has been acting for a long time, winning an Oscar in 1996 for her brilliant work in Fargo. Moviegoers may take advantage of the fact that she is so great but she has rarely been in this fine form. As Mildred, she tackles a role of a no-nonsense woman (which she plays so well) but brings such humanity to her that we are with her every step of the way, even if her decisions are extreme at best.
Sam Rockwell does his best work as officer Dixon, an intense, racist cop who has quite a temper and works on impulse too much of the time. Rockwell's character takes a turn at one point and Rockwell plays unhinged so well that he is as consistent as he has ever been.
The supporting cast is rounded out well by Lucas Hedges, John Hawkes and Peter Dinklage. McDonagh puts out one of the best scripts of the year laced with laugh out loud dark humor and quiet, dramatic moments that balance so effortlessly. It's hard to predict what comes next and that is what drives this film.
Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is one of the must see films of the year and I can predict will probably make my top five films. The performances are outstanding, especially McDormand and Rockwell, the script and direction are top notch and this is a great murder mystery comedy/drama. It is such a unique film and one that feels completely real. 4 stars/ 4 stars.",

1289,11 September 2018,abhinavaggarwal-13011,8, Life is unfair: At its best,"The movie exhibits life in its most crude and real form. Despite all the good reason and justice in the killer being caught, he is actually never caught and justice is not served despite the viewer very moved because of this. In a movie generally things go ideal. People who are good get the better and vice-versa. In this movie, this did not happen and the viewer is taken aback by it and has some sort of discomfort accepting the closing of the film. You can feel the pain of the mother and feel all the reason she should get justice and absolution but it just does not happen. About the racist cop, many people will feel that he did not do anything for redemption but is still portrayed as a good character in the end. But i feel that he never had to do anything for redemption. The movie is not about racism and portraying what is correct. He does change but juwt not in the racist way perhaps but in the way that he does realises his negelction of his duty and this is just another form of redemption.",
