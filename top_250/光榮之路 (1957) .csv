0,2 July 2006,bkoganbing,10, They Couldn't Take An Ant Hill,"Almost one hundred years later the concept of that static war of the trenches that was the Western front of World War I is almost unfathomable. After the French army stopped the German offensive at the Battle of the Marne, the French and British armies faced the Germans in a line of trenches that stretched from Belgium to Switzerland. About a quarter of France was occupied for four years in that time. The casualties ran into the millions in that stalemate that gains were only measured in meters.",/
1,15 October 2006,Steffi_P,9," ""Let the men have a few minutes more""","Although Kubrick's films are marked by their massive variation of genre and tone, one theme that crops up again and again is a strong anti-war sentiment, and this was never stated more strongly than in Paths of Glory. A relatively early Kubrick picture and, despite coming before what is considered his classic period, it is one of his best.",r

3,9 December 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10, Kubrick at the height of his powers- a wonderfully atmospheric film about the First World War,"I saw this movie for the first time on television today, after being persuaded by the reviews I read beforehand praising it. Also I like Kirk Douglas. Although I am not directly familiar with Kubrick's work, a shameful admission I know. Out of what I have seen so far I loved Dr Strangelove and despite only seeing it once while flicking through channels liked The Shining too. Anyway back on target, Paths of Glory was brilliant in my opinion! ",v
4,28 July 2007,WriterDave,9, Stands the Test of Time,An arrogant French general (a superb George Macready) orders his men on a suicide mission and then has the gall to try to court marshal and execute three of them for cowardice in the face of the enemy. A former lawyer turned colonel (Kirk Douglas in his prime) is the voice of reason against gross injustice. This excellently staged and wonderfully acted production is as much an acting showcase for Douglas as it is a directorial masterstroke by a young Stanley Kubrick who adapted this to the screen from a novel based on actual accounts.,i
5,11 May 2004,claudio_carvalho,10, An Anti-War Masterpiece,"In France, in the First World War, the insane and ambitious general Gen. Paul Mireau (George Macready) orders Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) to lead his men in a suicide attack against Germans in the unattainable Ant Hill. After a massacre of the French soldiers, Gen. Mireau orders his artillery to drop bombs between the French front line of attack and the trenches, to avoid the soldier to return to the protection of the trenches. The commander of the French artillery refuses to accomplish the order. Gen. Mireau asks his superior, Gen. George Broulard (Adolphe Menjou), to send three men to Court Martial and execute them for cowardice through shooting, as an example to the other soldiers. Colonel Dax, a former lawyer, defends his men in the unfair trial. Yesterday I watched this outstanding masterpiece for the first time and certainly it is among the best movies of the cinema history. The disgusting story shows the insanity of a war, where men are treated like numbers and not as human beings. The reality of the battles scenes is amazing. The cast has a stunning performance, highlighting the trio George Macready, Adolphe Menjou and Kirk Douglas. The lack of sensibility and respect for the human life and the cynicism in the dialogs of the two generals are fantastic. Two other points that called my attention are the fancy reception for the general staff, while their subalterns are fighting in the front and the misunderstanding of the real intentions of Colonel Dax by Gen. George Broulard. A must-see movie! My vote is ten.",e
6,19 January 2000,gbheron,10, Gripping Anti-War Film,"Paths of Glory is one of the best movies ever made, and possibly the best ""war"" movie, period.

No this film takes a different tact. ",w
7,15 August 2010,ma-cortes,8, Awesome movie stands as a broody statement against war and man's inhumanity to man,"Sensational antiwar treatise based on facts with a relentless and vivid denounce against the military commanding class represented by two senior Generals (George Macready , Adolphe Menjou ) who order his men a suicidal mission . France 1916 , an upright officer , Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas), must lead his soldiers against difficult enemy positions called the 'Ants Hill' . Then he's also the Colonel lawyer assigned to defend three (the privates Timothy Carey , Ralph Meeker , Joe Turkel) of them when the attack is lost against charges of cowardice and submitted to eventual firing squad. Never has the screen thrust so deeply into the guts of war! The most explosive motion picture in 25 years ! Bombshell! The roll of the drums... the click of the rifle-bolts... the last cigarette... and then... the shattering impact of this story... perhaps the most explosive motion picture in 25 years! It explodes in the no-man's land no picture ever dared cross before!

10,7 June 2002,kamerad,10, Kubrik's First Masterwork,"""Paths of Glory"" (1957) (and this is personal opinion of course) is Stanley Kubrick's first real masterpiece in what would be a long line of subsequent masterpieces.  I know that Kubrick had a reputation for making cold, unemotional films (which is a false impression, but that's the subject for another essay) but I don't believe there are many people who can deny how powerful this film is.  Through the editing, camera movement, incredibly realistic dialogue, and a now more fully realized use of irony, Kubrick creates an unforgettable anti-war parable.  I realize that my love for this film is incredibly obvious, but I'll try to focus on an analysis of the film rather than a review, but the movie is just so good!  ",4

General Georges Broulard convinces General Mireau to send his men on a suicide mission to attack the fortified Anthill. The men are worn out. General Mireau with glory in his eyes downplays the difficulties to Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas). He even threatens to relieve Dax when he gives less than full enthusiastic support. On a 3-person night patrol, drunken lieutenant Roget kills fellow soldier Lejeune and then falsifies the records despite Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker). Dax leads the attack the next morning. The first wave is wiped out and the men refuse to continue the attack. Mireau court-marshals a man from each company for cowardice. Roget sends Paris as one of those men. Dax defends them in the kangaroo court.",5
12,28 January 2010,TheAnimalMother,10, Glorious Integrity In Every Aspect!!,"Paths Of Glory is a masterpiece without doubt. Usually a masterpiece is the pinnacle of a directors career. However when you are talking about Stanley Kubrick, you are talking about genuine genius. This is just one of his many masterpieces, but Paths Of Glory is probably as good a film as any of Kubrick's other best works. I have seen tons of war films in my life, many great ones. Honestly, this is my favorite of them all. When I first saw this film I didn't expect it to blow me away. After all it is an early Kubrick film, however it blew me away constantly, and completely. This is not only one of the greatest war films ever made, not only one of the greatest black & white films ever made, it is simply one of the greatest films ever made bar none. The film screams integrity, in each and every way. This film is a joy to watch, and in my estimation, Paths Of Glory will remain forever as one of cinemas greatest accomplishments.",6
13,3 November 2000,bmaclach,10, An anti-war movie hitting closer to home.,"I consider Paths of Glory as one of the most memorable of Kubrick's entire output. The most remarkable aspect of this pioneer anti-war film is the complete absence of any persons depicting the ""real"" enemy. Therefore, the significance of the film lay not so much in its anti-war message, but in its brilliant expose of the ""monsters within"" the general staff, superbly acted by Adolphe Menjou and George Macready. The message here is that the enemy lurks much closer to home. In most war films, whether they glorify or condemn the carnage, there is rarely any venturing at all into the darker side of the politics. This film is a tour de force in its unabashed depiction of just how misguided is the quest for glory as an end in itself; and in the portrayal of the leaders who would shamelessly sacrifice others for their own self aggrandizement. Truly, one of my all time favourite movies.",8
14,31 January 2005,Anonymous_Maxine,10, Scary.,"It really is a testament to the power of the story told by this film that it stars the French army and they all speak nothing but English, and yet it is still be incredibly moving and compelling. On the other hand, the movie is not really about war but about the soldiers, kind of like Full Metal Jacket. It is structured almost exactly the opposite, with the first half of the film taking place on the battlefield and the second half off. Kirk Douglas plays Col. Dax, whose platoon is ordered to take a hill called the Anthill against staggering odds, almost surely a suicide mission.",7

The setting is WW1 and the film follows the French army as they attempt to defend and retaliate against a massive German bombardment. Conflict comes from the machinations of an over-zealous officer who is determined to see success achieved at all costs, no matter the casualties taken along the way. An ensemble of fine performances, taut direction and an intelligent script all combine to make one of the hardest-hitting war movies out there.",5

17,16 June 2021,nickenchuggets,10," ""And you can go to hell before I apologize to you""","Paths of Glory is a movie that anybody can look at the cast of and instantly tell that it's going to be worthwhile. As if being directed by the legendary Kubrick wasn't enough to persuade you, Kirk Douglas also plays the main character. The movie is set during the first world war, where huge masses of men are killed in just a matter of seconds due to new inventions like machine guns and more advanced artillery. Douglas plays a colonel in the french army named Dax. Dax's superior officer, General Mireau, is eager to kill germans, but is aware the plan to take a fortified position known as the anthill is unlikely to succeed. Mireau's boss, General Broulard, promises to promote him if the attack goes well. Mireau vows to take the position, and doesn't care how many french soldiers die in the process. The attack soon begins, and colonel Dax leads his men over the top of their trench to attack the germans. It's a disaster. None of the men reach the enemy position, and the others refuse to get out of the trench to advance because they know they'll be killed too. General Mireau watches the action unfold from a distance and is infuriated at the colonel's lack of progress. He tells artillery to fire on his own men in order to force them out into the open, but the artillery gunners refuse. Mireau now blames Dax for the attack's failure, saying he wasn't aggressive enough, and wants to court martial a number of his soldiers for being cowards. Colonel Dax decides to defend his men at the court martial, but it is nothing more than a setup. No matter what he says, the men are found guilty anyway, and sentenced to be shot. Despite Dax's pleas, the men are eventually executed, and the person who gives the order to fire is Lieutenant Roget, who served under Dax in the trenches during the attack. At the end of the movie, Dax's men are in a bar listening to a captured German girl sing a folk song. This is one of the movies that best illustrates how many lives are destroyed by the deadly game called war. The movie conveys to the viewer that while older men declare it and make the plans, plans go wrong and young soldiers die. It's happened in every conflict, and world war 1 was recent enough to make the audience understand how horrific it was to fight through. Sadly, this type of pointless assault that involved thousands of men dying one after another would be the hallmark of the first world war, and the carnage would be unmatched for years to come. As expected, Douglas is superb as the sympathetic but ruthless colonel Dax, who tries to do everything in his power to stop his men from being executed, going so far as to call one of his commanding officers a sadist. George Macready plays the sadistic General Mireau amazingly, and he really does resemble a psychopath when he orders the artillery fired at his own frontline. Just another person twisted into a maniac by his thirst for prestige. Definitely an essential ww1 movie.",/
18,15 November 2003,psychprofessor,10, One of the all-time best antiwar movies,If you can watch this movie all the way through to the final scene in a bar in which a German girl (played by Kubrick's wife!) sings a song and all the grizzled veterans in the room cry--and not cry yourself--then something's wrong with you. This is one heck of a powerful film and makes a better statement against the senselessness of war than many films with vastly bigger budgets. It blew me away the first time I saw it.,?
19,17 December 2003,cfnas,10, One of the greatest anti-war movies eve,"This movie, along with the original screen version of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" must rank as one of the most tragic versions of what war is really like. The arrogance and total disregard for the welfare of the soldier as beautifully portrayed by Menjou and McReady, in opposition to the care and concern of the Colonel so humanly portrayed by  Douglas adds to the reality of what the world was like in the days of the ""Great War."" Additionally, the roles played by Wayne Morris, Ralph Meeker and the self serving aide to McReady add to the greatness of this memorable motion picture. There is no ""Viva La France"" here.",r

21,17 September 2022,zardoz-13,10, A Classic World War I Courtmartial Trial about Military Injustice,"Kirk Douglas and Stanley Kubrick united to make two classic movies during their respective careers. ""Paths of Glory"" and ""Spartacus"" were those films. Not only was ""Paths of Glory"" (1957) released before ""Spartacus"" (1960), but ""Paths"" was filmed in black & white rather than in Technicolor. Kubrick wrote the screenplay with novelists Jim Thompson and Calder Willingham. When authorship was disputed, the Writer's Guild said Thompson had written seven scenes and they attributed the bulk of the credit to Kubrick. Anybody who likes to see the books they read turned into a movies that respect the origins of the source material will be happy to know that the film--according to Kubrick biographer Norman Kagan--stuck in large part to Cobb's book. ""Paths"" followed the French Army during the First World War and the court-martial trial of four soldiers accused of cowardice. Mind you, it didn't matter the failure to defeat an impregnable enemy--the Imperial German Army--was the chief blame, not any lack of tenacity on the part of Frenchmen who failed to storm position referred to as the Anthill. The trial is held in part to bolster the backbone of the troops in the trenches. Clearly, ""Paths"" emphasizes the futility of war. Similarly, in real life, in 1915, four French soldiers faced a firing squad for failure to follow orders given by General Géraud Réveilhac. This true-life incident is known as the Souain corporals affair. Interestingly, that quartet of doomed soldiers were later exonerated of all charges! Meantime, Douglas plays Colonel Dax who defends these four guys because he had served as a defense attorney for criminal cases before he buttoned himself into a uniform. Moreover, Dax himself had lead two of the charges, too.",f
22,3 July 2006,theowinthrop,10, The Mutinies of 1917 - a fictional variant,"Although he did the wonderful crime film THE KILLING before he did this, it was PATHS OF GLORY that brought Stanley Kubrick's talents forward. After PATHS OF GLORY he would make all types of films, but he would basically make them as he wanted to (although when working with his star here, Kirk Douglas, on SPARTACUS he would have such friction with Douglas that they never made any other films together afterward). So if it had not been for PATHS OF GLORY there would not have been LOLITA, DR. STRANGELOVE, 2001, BARRY LYNDON, and the other films. The Kubrick stamp of film artistry was born here.",_
23,4 July 2010,gary-444,6, Strong Early Kubrick Anti-War Film,"I watched this, some 53 years before it was made, without knowing anything about it. It transpires that this was a huge advantage in making an objective assessment of a film which has historically divided opinion. The context is important. Made in 1957, it was part of the double feature era when people went to the cinema to see two films, both under 90 minutes. The demand was that a full story be told in that time meaning that far more storytelling ground was often covered then than in modern day films. Certainly here, a longer running time or reduced content would have been a benefit.",=
24,29 June 2009,dromasca,10, the first masterpiece of Kubrick,"'Path of Glory' would not have happened without Kirk Douglas. He not only makes here one of the deepest and most human roles of his acting career, but also put all his influence and some money into determining the great studios to make this anti-war film, which became the first in a series of great anti-war films of Kubrick. The story of the first world war French soldiers sent to an almost sure death by their corrupted generals and then randomly court-martial-ed and sent to death for cowardice when they face the predictable failure is turned by Kubrick into a splendidly built and beautifully filmed pledge for humanity. And it is humanity that prevails despite the tragic destiny of the soldiers. The final scene in which soldiers join a German prisoner girl into humming a simple German love song is a scene of redemption and of pure shaming of nationalism. Kubrick was still, at least at that point in his life and career an optimist.",t

Rather than simply showing us the horrors of warfare and declaring that 'war is hell,' this films genuinely fills us with unbridled hate and anger, revealing the sheer folly and uselessness of combat.

That's the general message of Stanley Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory,"" but it's not meant in the sense of people killing other people is bad, it's because war makes us dehumanize ourselves, make poor decisions and devalue human life. This is a war story told on one side. The antagonist in this film is not the other side, it's the people in power and our inability to see clearly because our judgment is clouded by ideas we claim to be greater than ourselves. The film might not seem like a fair portrayal of the military, but it is a masterpiece of showing how war can turn us into terrible people if we're not careful.",_

It happened in France during WWI. A platoon of soldiers was sent on a suicidal mission. The battle was essentially an excuse for both nations to try and gain prestige. Some French soldiers refused to go into battle. They were put on trial for ""cowardice in the face of the enemy"". In defending them, Col.

34,16 February 2007,Hitchcoc,10, Those Who Decide Should Fight,"I've often been Luke warm about Kirk Douglas. This, however, is a phenomenal movie. War is usually fought by people who have no say in what is happening. The despicable man who can send thousands to their deaths to get a military promotion is every bit as bad as the enemy being fought. We have a lot of that going on in this country. Those who choose war should fight it or send their own to fight it. This is ad much a story of how people treat each other as it is a war movie. We hand over power to a complex that sustains itself on the backs of those who never get to state their cases. The men chosen are done so in an arbitrary way, caught unawares and defenseless. Of course, religion plays a part in it too. We may die, but there is a reward for us. There are so many parallels to what happens to men in combat (the ambush, for instance) that these men become victims. Like someone said, so much war is fought over anthills. I have never felt so sorry for characters as I do for these because they are defenseless. The cockroach scene has stayed with me my whole life. It's the same basic premise as Galipoli (which came much later).",
35,16 January 2007,rmax304823,9, Kubrick's Most Moving Film.,"It's easy to snare an audience by making a movie about an execution, which is why such movies seem so common -- ""Ted Bundy,"" ""I Want to Live"", ""The Book of Daniel."" Sometimes the whole story is about the technical aspects of the execution -- ""The Execution of Private Slovick."" It may be easier for an audience to identify with someone about to be executed than it is to identify with someone in a particularized conflict. Should Marlon Brando squeal on his friends and employers in ""On the Waterfront""? Well, yes, but none of us have ever been in Terry Malloy's shoes nor will we ever be, whereas we are all going to face execution some day.

36,13 February 2000,Quinoa1984,10, One of the best (anti) war films ever made!,"Stanely Kubrick's Paths of Glory is a great example of when Kubrick was at his best- and only in his twenties. This depiction of World War one with Kubrick as director and Kirk Douglas in perfect form, it takes the viewer into the objectivity of it all. What happens in the trenches, if just from a bird's eye view? His gliding camera in these scenes is remarkable. Then when he moves into the courtroom scenes, and the following awaiting of the soldier's last call, it becomes heartbreaking, and it becomes one of those rare stories that never loses its relevance. And the last scene shows that Kubrick, contrary to his de-humanizing nature in his films, reaches an emotional peak equal to De Sica or even Dreyer. It gets better every year. A classic of anti-war sentiment.",
37,14 February 2020,Coventry,9," Liberté, égalité, fraternité !","Usually I don't comment or popular classics or war movies, but I absolutely wanted to leave a review for ""Paths of Glory"" for two principal reasons. First, as a sort of small homage to Kirk Douglas. This great gentleman of Hollywood passed away early 2020 after reaching the more than respectable age of 103. Nevertheless, he will be sorely missed. Secondly, and most important, because not any other movie ever made comes even close to depicting the pure madness and hypocrisy of warfare as accurately and truthfully as Stanley Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory"". The three words in the subject line of this user-comment represent the widely known moto of the nation of France. Logically interpreted these words imply that all French people are free, equal and live in brotherhood. Well, this moto certainly wasn't yet put into practice during the horrible World War I. During the most shocking sequences, Kubrick masterfully juxtaposes the wealth and luxury of French military generals (fancily dining and waltzing with aristocratic ladies) versus the daily agony the ""ordinary"" French soldiers are confronted with (suffering and dying in the trenches). These same hypocritic generals give the command for downright impossible attack raids, and then subsequently accuse their troops of cowardice and blame them for their own strategy-incompetence against - around that time - much better organized German army. Douglas impressively portrays the honorable Colonel (and attorney of law) Dax who puts his career and reputation at stake to defend a trio of soldiers put on trial ""as an example"".",

Despite realising the hazardous nature of the order, Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) reluctantly agrees to lead the charge. As expected the attack goes badly and many French troops lose their lives which results in a large number of men refusing to leave their trenches. General Mireau sees this from his safe position and, refusing to admit that the attack was suicide from the outset, blames the cowardice of those who refused to fight for the devastating outcome of the battle. As a result Mireau demands that three soldiers from the regiment be held accountable and face an immediate court martial followed by death by firing squad. Dax seeks for the French military hierarchy to admit the truth.",

40,3 October 2019,ironhorse_iv,9, Director Stanley Kubrick's 1957 anti-war film 'Paths of Glory' was indeed on the right path. It was a masterpiece.,"Like the tagline for this classic says, 'it explode in the no-man's land, where no picture ever dare crossed'. No wonder, why Kubrick's film was added to the Library of Congress National Film Registry in 1992. It was a very memorable movie. Filmed in black and white and shot on location in Germany, the movie was based on the novel of the same name by author Humphrey Cobb tells the story of a French military lawyer and colonel, Dax (Kirk Douglas), having to defend a group of soldiers charge of cowardice in a life or death court martial case during the Great War. Without spoiling the motion picture too much, while the book is graphic and gory, told from multiple points of view, the film is indeed as bleak as it can be as well with its titular main character. Unlike 1930 'All Quiet on the Western Front' & 1937 war movies 'La Grand Illusion' which critique of the romantic idealization of duty only to show the violent battle scenes where countless waves of men are slaughter like cattle. This picture doesn't even bother painting any part of the war in a positive light. There is little to no camaraderie between soldiers and the officers see them as nothing, but cannon fodder. I kinda like that approach to the material, because having brotherhood within the military does undermine the whole anti-war message. Besides the mise-en-scene ending with soon to be Kubrick's wife, Susanne Christian singing ""The Faithful Hussar' & the snare drum in the beginning, the film has little to no music to force emotional feelings. You rarely see that in these types of movies at the time as everything has to sound epic & patriotic. Another great thing about this motion picture is the way, it was filmed. Kubrick's vision allows the audience to feel stuck and trapped along with the troops in the ever-so dangerous confined trenches with tight pov and close ups. We see the dirt, the mud and blood in detail. Also we don't see the enemy visual at all; making every scene on the front seem more haunting and suspenseful, because any minute, a soldier might get picked off by a sniper or artillery. As for scenes for high ranking officers like Major General Georges Broulard (Adolphe Menjou), we witness the opulently from both exterior and interior wide shots of the huge mansions in which they're living in. You see all the riches & grandeur. While this approach makes all the officers seem stereotypical like greedy elite aristocrats born into privilege with no knowledge of hardship. In truth, some of them were from the working class whom stumble upon power within the ranks through tough service like Brigadier General Paul Mireau (George Macready). They just lost their moral way while getting there. A heartless shallow of a man that war brewed and needs. A type of a person that Colonel Dax hopes not to turn out to become by the end of the film. Douglas acting in this, is astounding as his facial features show the dilemma, his character has to go with. You really do feel the struggle that he has to do his duty for his country, but also his wiliness to protect his men from unreasonable harm. Honestly, all the performers did a hell of a job. I think the director was a little too harsh on veteran actor Adolphe Menjou. He was fine. I doubt he needed to redo the same scene 17 times. The same can be same with the doomed men 'last meal' scene. It didn't need 68 takes. Stanley Kubrick was just being a semi jerk perfectionist. However, he did made the right choice with firing actor Timothy Carey. He was indeed disruptive as Pvt. Maurice Ferol. The whole faking his own kidnapping for personal publicity was outrageous uncalled for. Anyways, due to the movie's offensive critical assessment within the hierarchical military. The government from France & Switzerland banned the movie for almost twenty years following its release. The film was also withdrawn for many years within countries like Germany and Spain. Even in the United States, the motion picture was banned in military establishments, both at home and overseas, due to its content for some time. It was also denied an Academy Award nomination. Regardless, the fact that the movie has alienated a lot of audience members at the time. In the long run, the film loosely based on the true story of the Souain corporals affair during World War 1 has gain a strong following after Vietnam War era when together with the Watergate scandal contributed to the crisis of confidence within the post-war militarism lifestyle. It's now considered as one of Kubrick's best. I just glad that the director took the risk with making the film and didn't make it more commercial to the general public. The altered happy ending, they filmed could had ruin the message. The same with Paramount Pictures who proposed changing the army to that of Czarist Russia, due to being afraid of offending the French government. Thank goodness, the changes were reversed back more closely to the original novel at the demand of actor Kirk Douglas. In the end, he saw this movie for me. Despite some heavy handed moments, the film is a bombshell of a movie that needs to be seen. It's one path worth taken.",

During their initial conversation about taking the Anthill, General Mireau (George Macready) emphatically states that the safety of the men under his command is more important than sending them to certain death on an impossible suicide mission. Yet in virtually the very next scene he's shown making his rounds in the trenches determined to stiffen the men for the very same engagement he railed against earlier. He seemed to disregard an opportunity for a promotion while disagreeing with General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou), but the only thing that seems to make sense is that he changed his mind about that.",

Indeed, Kubrick astutely captures not only the brutality of war, but also the frequent absurdity and futility of same in both the harrowing combat scenes and at the shattering climax in which three innocent men are executed just so those in charge can prevent themselves from feeling disgraced.

45,4 April 2009,JohnWelles,10, Brilliant War Film.,"Stanly Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory"" (1957) is one of the very few First Wold War movies. I my opinion, the reason is that the death in WW1 was unbelievable. On the the first day alone in The Battle of the Somme (1916), the British suffered 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead, the single most bloodiest day in the history of the British Army - and remember, this was before the Atomic Bomb. Hollywood would probably not be able to tackle something so grim and depressing (althouh Hollywood might do a WW1 film nowadays, especially after such films as ""Shinderlers List"" and ""Saving Privet Ryan"") when Hollywood mainly deals in escapism. And that what makes ""Paths of Glory"" so unusual. Seen from the French's point of view, it has three French solders being executed after taking lots because their unit is found guilty of cowardice while trying to take a German controlled hill, called the ""Ant Hill"". Kirk Douglas gives a fantastic performance as ""Colonel Dax"" and so do Adolphe Menjou and George Macready. Stanly Kubrick's first masterpiece, and one definitely one to watch.",

47,8 November 2021,perica-43151,9, A portrayal of corruption of French and powerful,"Based on a real story, this Kubrick early work is as condemning of the French mentality as Le Corbeau, but at the same time universalist in its depiction of the corruption of powerful and haplessness of the little guy. In order to get a new medal, a French officer, ugly both inside and out, cold, selfish and arrogant, orders a senseless attack on some insignificant hill along the trenches in which he fully expects more than half of the soldiers to die. During the attack, soldiers fall back to trenches, yet he orders artillery to bomb its own side for not attacking enough, but the senseless request is declined. Later, he orders a court-martial for cowardice for three random soldiers who are later executed, despite being innocent. The men are shot but the officer is revealed to be what he is, ordering bombing of his soldiers, later on. All this based on a real incident in the French army in WWI, and the movie was banned in France for almost 20 years, and Switzerland, Germany and even Spain followed suit in order not to offend the French or military sensibilities. It is a potent condemnation of power and of human condition, a cynical yet realistic view into workings of not only the petty French psyche with its hypocrisies, but is applicable more generally to humans less obviously degen erate.

Like a few films now considered classics, Paths of Glory was simply out-of-step with its time; as it turned out, it was ahead of its time.

As many people involved with the project knew, this film would be remembered through time. Based on a real incident, it reflected the change in sentimentality of how soldiers were being used as human waves, where it was acceptable to allow for a certain percent of casualties. This disregard for human life is eloquently displayed with a series of scenes the demonstrate the futility of war. From the miserable trench conditions, to the fighting for mounds of dirt, to the blind military strategy that merely repeats failed attacks, to the absurdity of threatening death as punishment as part of the ""rules"" of war.

As with all wars, none ever succeeds in proving it's original intention. Take the First World War for instance. It's was touted as the War to End all Wars. That never happened. Instead, it is agreed, it firmly established the reasons for the Second World War. This film is entitled "" The Paths of War ' and like all wars there is much insanity in it's story. During the many battles, there were orders and counter-orders, some of which made no sense at all. In this movie, one such order concerned the careers of several high ranking French Officers, such as Gen. George Broulard and Gen. Paul Mireau (Adolphe Menjou and George Macready) who were only interested in making a name for themselves. Thus when they concocted a suicidal attack on a German position called 'The Ant hill' they were fully aware that such an assault would needlessly cost the lives of hundreds of French soldiers. Being veterans of many such reckless and futile assaults, many in the infantry refused to go. The furious Generals thereafter selected several soldiers to be arrested and tried for Cowardice and executed. Despite the most persuasive and certainly the most logical defense offered by Col. Dax, their lawyer (Kirk Douglas), the cowardly generals refused to change their order. The entire saga of this true story is forever affixed in the annals of French stupidity. Moreover, the insanity of the French Officer corps, is a prime example of all Militaries throughout the world. Indeed, movies like this and 'All Quiet on the Western Front' are excellent reasons for abolishing war altogether.

This also shows how during war how sometimes ridiculous, suicidal orders come from high command and how some high ranking military brass value their own career advancement and image over what would seem to be in the best interest in their troops. Paths Of Glory shows how cheap life is, especially in a time of war and the futility of it all. Kirk Douglas is great as Col.Dax and is the moral center of the film and one Hell of a tough soldier.

The dialogue is farcically unrealistic; General Mireau's lines, in particular, are of the ""Aha, my pretty, at last I have you in my clutches!"" variety. One almost thinks that the director is trying to make the audience hiss. Character development is non-existent, as is subtlety. The ballroom scene, in particular, with the grandly attired generals dancing to Strauss waltzes in luxurious surroundings with elegantly attired women is - get it? - supposed to be a contrast with the misery of the soldiers; the point is made like being hit on the side of the head with 2-by-4. Kirk Douglas does the best he can with a limited part.

Menjou and (especially) Macready are perfect for their parts. I'm of two minds about Kirk Douglas as the colonel instructed to make the attack which he knows is doomed to failure.

Nevertheless, Douglas could act, and as the central figure in the film, he carries it off. There are a great many outstanding scenes in this movie -- what else would you expect with Stanley Kubrick as writer and director -- but the most telling is when a frightened German girl (Christiane Kubrick, also known as Suzanne Christian) is escorted on stage in a beer hall filled with French soldiers who despise the Germans and forced to sing a sad song in German which when the catcalls die down leave every one in the audience (on both sides of the screen) misty eyed or crying.

When a second wave of troops refuse to attack, their commanding officer General Mireau desperately orders his artillery to open fire on them to force them onto the battlefield. The artillery commander, however, refuses to do so without a written order. To try and deflect blame from himself for the failure of the offensive, Mireau orders three soldiers from the regiment, chosen at random, to be tried for cowardice.

It would be more precise to argue that Paths of Glory was the film which showed Kubricks complete mastery of TRADITIONAL film grammar and techniques, as first' exemplified by Griffith and Pudovkin, while his later films show him EXPERIMENTING with those techniques,challenging established ideas of narration and characterization. In addition, Paths of Glory is-on the surface- a more 'didactic' and ""humanistic"" film than his later works. He seems to be delivering a conventional ""liberal"" message; ""war is hell', ""men should not be inhumane to man',etc.While Kubrick is indeed a liberal humanist who  looks askance at the military, his film is not simply a pacifist sermon.Kubrick is, instead offering  a close analysis of the meaning of courage , loyalty, and honor. These virtues, so often extolled by 'conservatives' are NOT mocked by Kubrick. Instead he is criticizing the MISUSE of these virtues by ""scoundrels' such as the military brass hats.The true hero of paths of glory is NOT the well-meaning but tragically ineffectual liberal 'hero', Colonel Dax (superbly played by Kirk Douglas), instead the hero is a GROUP of people, the ordinary, suffering 'grunts' of the 'poor bloody  infantry', who, in the films unforgettable closing scene, hum along with a frightened German  girl as she sings a love song in her native language.",

It depicts not only the attitudes of the corrupt army officials but also trench life and its futility too with excellence. As a film, it is pretty much a perfect film all round  even the length is appropriately short as to not allow for unnecessary sentiments to build up. Kirk Douglas does very well with his lead role, and he even felt that he worked so well under Kubrick's direction that he chose Kubrick to replace Anthony Mann as director of the epic 'Spartacus', a Hollywood success that lead Kubrick to be able to choose his own big budget projects.",

Indeed, there is much to admire. The clinically sharp black and while photography; the use of long tracking shots; fine performances, particularly George Macready as an ambitious general and Adolphe Menjou in perhaps his finest work in a career filled with portrayals of reptilian manipulators; crisp editing; effective use of sound. Indeed, it bears many of the hallmarks of Kubrick's more mature (from Dr. Strangelove and Lolita onwards) style.

This and 'The Killing' from a year earlier are just a one-two punch. You can just feel Kubrick sharpening his knives on this one in preparation for 'Dr. Strangelove.' While this is a drama, you can't help but laugh at the complete absurdity of the situations. I kind of doubt (or at least *need* to, anyway) that an officer would be allowed to go as far as he did, but I think Kubrick wasn't necessarily going for a literal lesson here and was instead trying to make a larger statement about the lives of soldiers being in the hands of madmen.

This 1957 film continued that great tradition with another look at the insanity aroused by war. In this instance it explores the insanity that can be aroused within an armies own ranks and the blind obsessions and principles of some individuals. Kubrick is never one for pulling punches in his films and with a classic star at his disposal in Kirk Douglas; he goes for the jugular of the issue.

Running a scant 86 minutes, the movie wastes no time in showing the exploitation of military ranks by the French General Staff to participate in a suicide mission on the western front. The objective is to take over ""Ant Hill"", a German stronghold of no strategic importance to the French except to the ambitious General Mireau, who is given the incentive of a promotion if the attack is successful. It's oblivious from the outset that the chances of success are practically nil since the men in the trenches are battered and weak from a number of successful advancements into enemy territory. The conscientious Colonel Dax is handed the responsibility of leading the men, but it turns completely fatal due initially to the blunder of one commanding officer's orders and the dominant German forces. Desperate to avoid humiliation, Mireau transfers blame for the failure to the soldiers and accuses them of cowardice.",

Besides the story building talks up front, the sequences show only failures, cheats, treacheries and stupidity. Kirk Douglas is the only actor doing a decent job in this movie.

It is a timely work, an implicit critique of a 1950s, conformist America ruled by a military hero President.

The basic problem was his world-view - apparent in the few interviews he gave - deeply anti-humanist and incredibly arrogant. That the later films are so devoid of intellect or passion may well be why he has become a favourite of so many who want films to be arty without actually being truly difficult. This has little to do with ""Paths Of Glory"", made before Kubrick had developed the deadened style of those later films. Perhaps the secret ingredient is Kirk Douglas, here at his muscular, intelligent best and obviously deeply committed to the material. The gliding camera in the trenches and the battle scenes are amongst the best filmed moments of 1950's cinema - realistic in a way few English language films of that time were, the only comparison being in Japanese films such as ""Fires On The Plain"". The film is very cleverly constructed, playing almost as a two-acter of trench and aftermath, with a coda that is surprisingly moving. There are a few gripes, as always, the first one is Kirk's hairdo which is pure 1956, slightly more serious is the loading of the film against the generals - maybe this sort of thing is needed in cinema, but compared to literature it is quite crude. I would disagree with those who see this as an anti-war film - it seems to me to be simply a film that takes place in wartime. It may explore what war can lead men to do, but, like it's hero, there is little suggestion that it explicitly condemns war. Overall I would rank this as a great film, to my mind it is certainly Kubrick's finest.",

The uneven bass drum beats sound again and again, while the pattering of the snare mimics their slow progress, sliding over dirt and blood and mud. Then with a sudden cut and a clattering of the cymbals, a Lieutenant has killed his own man in a fit of cowardice. Later, the slow and steady drum beats again lead us through the progressions of an execution by firing squad.

131,15 July 2017,mark-rojinsky,10, Brilliant fifties anti-war movie,"Banned in France till 1975, Kubrick's Paths of Glory (1957) is an unusually powerful and incisive cinematic discourse relating to the futility of war. In fact it would be almost unbearably grim without the performance of Douglas as Colonel Dax - the liberal French military advocate defending three innocent soldiers accused of cowardice on contrived trumped-up charges by the over-ambitious and arrogant General Mireau (George Macready). Such social issues as class differences and military hypocrisy in the French High Command are emphasised. The contrast between the rococo marbly splendours of the chateau inhabited by the generals and the godawful trenches at the front are telling. Douglas' Dax character gives the film its only light and warmth. In appearance he looks dynamic - sporting greased back fair hair and lantern-jaw; the brigade number '701' is embossed on his collar and cuffs plus he wears a prototype wristwatch. Along with 20.000 Leagues under the Sea (1954), Ulisse (1954) and Light at the Edge of the World(1971) it is one of his most purposeful performances although it lacks the Nietzschean undertones of the aforementioned adventure and sword and sandals films.

A high-ranking French general is seeking further promotion, and he sees an opportunity to do so by having his regiment take a German position known as ""The Anthill"".

135,24 April 2007,jboothmillard,8, Paths of Glory,"This is not exactly an all war film, but from director Stanley Kubrick it is still a great film, even Winston Churchill was impressed with it. Based on a true event in World War I, this film sees Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) taking his troops getting ready to go over the top of the trenches, with the command by the arrogant aristocrat General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou). It is during this battle that three of the troops disobey their orders to advance, they do not go too far, and this results in their court case. They are found guilty, and face execution by firing squad. The villain of the picture is the arrogant general for making a stupid order that would ultimately be sending his army to death, and not listening to the reasons for the troops not advancing. Also starring Ralph Meeker as Corporal Paris, George Macready as General Mireau, Wayne Morris as Lieutenant Roget, Richard Anderson as Major Saint-Auban, Joe Turkel as Private Pierre Arnaud, Timothy Carey as Private Ferol, Peter Capell as Colonel Judge, Susanne Christian as the German girl and Bert Freed as Sergeant Boulanger. Personally, the film is a triumph only for the battle scene, and the execution, but still a great Kubrick classic. It was nominated the for Best Film from any Source. Kirk Douglas was number 17 on 100 Years, 100 Stars, and the film was number 23 on The 100 Greatest War Films. Very good!",

Although I consider ""The Killing"" an already stellar film, I see why this one would get so much love: its anti-war themes are splendidly developed in Kubrick's unforgiving way, giving the viewer every reason to keep his hopes high, but regularly smashing them in his face, showing how the world actually works and not how the classic movies would like to make us believe. The character of Dax (a performance that Kirk Douglas grows into as the movie progresses) seems to be the only reasonable person in a maddened system where human lives matter less than the career of the powerful. The natural instinct of survival (showed by the sentenced soldiers as they approach the end) is labelled as ""cowardice"" and reprimanded by those who are not in danger, of course. But the scene that may have moved me the most is the ending, with the French soldiers first taunting the German girl but then getting emotional as they realize that they share the human nature, and all the mad orders they follow have no meaning at all.",

The most awful, even if the number of dead is inferior to the WW2 one. It shows how the high commandment despised the lives of soldiers, it shows hypocrisy, disgusting behavior towards the troops. Don't miss the sequence between two generals played by Adolphe Menjou and George Macready. Macready was at first reluctant to sacrifice his own men, and suddenly he finds a pretext not to lose face in front of his superior officer general Menjou.... And accepts to obey orders from the headquarters. And during the film, the audience can see how Macready takes great concern about his soldiers lives.... Useless to say that this anti war film was forbidden in France before 1972. Only Yves Boisset, the French director, will be courageous enough to denounce this slaughterhouse with LE PANTALON, decades later.

There is simply no other director who ever lived who could possibly produce anything as complex, taught, tense, riveting and ultimately heartbreaking as Paths of Glory with the technology available in the 1950s. Part court(marshall)room drama part war epic with trench warfare sequences to rival those produced 70 years later Paths reins supreme as a mastery of script and production and truly stands amongst the greatest films of its era, director and genre. Kirk Douglas provides the emphatic heart of the story with a powerhouse performance as the commanding officer/ defence attorney for a group of soldiers accused of cowardice in the face of a suicide mission which lays the groundwork for a thesis on the fight between justice and power which will inevitably leave viewers almost seven decades later with wet eyes glued to the screen in the closing chapters.",

Scripted by Kubrick, Calder Willingham, and Jim Thompson, this tells a convincing and compelling story in high style. Hollywood was loathe to tackle what was deemed controversial material, in the light of Americas' post WWII patriotism, but actor and director stood by the material.

Frankly this is an excellent film and a more than worthy addition to the genre labelled loosely as 'anti-war'. The fact that it deals with the First rather than the Second World War tends to place it in the minority but it is well worthy of taking its place along the original version of All Quiet On The Western Front and it did, of course, inspire a rip-off in the shape of King and Country which covered its tracks by focusing on one soldier (Tom Courteney) rather than three (Joe Turkel, Ralph Meeker, Timothy Carey) on trial for alleged cowardice and being defended by a serving officer - in this case Kirk Douglas, in the rip-off Dirk Bogarde.

152,20 December 2014,oscaralbert,8, Since France conceals its military tactics . . .,". . . to maintain a strategic advantage, it's up to Americans such as Stanley Kubrick and Kirk Douglas--the PATHS OF GLORY creators--to expose the secrets of French military success. Many of these tips involve execution by firing squad. When you face embarrassment from whistle blowers such as Edward Snowden and Monica Lewinsky, just shoot them (like Corporal Phillip Paris here). Since decorated war heroes such as SERGEANT YORK or that Pennsylvania Marine who gunned down his ex-wife and her family this week, can become post-war liabilities, just shoot them before the war ends (like Private Pierre Renaud's fate here). With the high cost of medical care, when soldiers are wounded in battle, why award them Purple Hearts, when you can just finish the job the Enemy started and shoot them (like Private Maurice Ferol here), even if you need to strap their stretcher to the execution post and slap them out of a comatose state (Private Renaud's fate here)? This French approach to Military Discipline virtually eliminates the need for veterans' benefits and V.A. hospitals, while insuring sterling reputations for the general staff Muckety-Mucks. True, it takes a lot of bullets (nine per soldier) and sandbags to do things the French Way, as depicted in PATHS OF GLORY. Maybe the guillotine would be cheaper.",

It says more still that the best value a film represents, despite unremitting excellence all around, is in its dialogue and characterizations, and the themes that surface therefrom. To say that this picture is anti-war is wildly insufficient - it's also a scathing, wholesale condemnation of the military, its command structure, its rules and strictures, and its bloviating bluster; of the so-called civilian oversight of the military that graciously awards perceived triumphs and sweeps failures and faults under the rug; of the self-serving way those in power cling recklessly to it, leeches on a bloated corpse, and expects, rewards, and encourages like corruption in others; of any system that would hang a sword over a person's head, answer to the beck and call of arbitrary rules and procedures and the whims of those in power, and yet dare to append ""justice"" anywhere to its name; of the unending lies and abject inhumanity upon which military decisions, and power generally, are made; the empty pretenses upon which respect for all such institutions are predicated; the harmful and outmoded gender norms that are detrimental to men (as much as they are to women, non-binary or gender non-conforming individuals, and so on); and more.

In time, Stanley would come to appreciate this movie making tenet (Dr-Strangelove) (64). And it's worth bearing this in mind when your General anger begins to build, just as Kirk's begins to blow, that the cold tactics employed in the Great War followed a tradition going back for centuries, one that typically cared little for the fighting man's chance of survival.

Therefore, the significance of the film lay not so much in its anti-war message, but in its brilliant expose of the ""monsters within"" the general staff, superbly acted by Adolphe Menjou and George Macready. The message here is that the enemy lurks much closer to home. In most war films, whether they glorify or condemn the carnage, there is rarely any venturing at all into the darker side of the politics. This film is a tour de force in its unabashed depiction of just how misguided is the quest for glory as an end in itself; and in the portrayal of the leaders who would shamelessly sacrifice others for their own self aggrandizement.

It is not only the political morons, but the military general morons that get millions of young men killed for little or no reason. This film makes that perfectly clear. The saddest part of the film is that we still have this problem in the world of 2023. I personally suffered from these morons during the Vietnam War, as the head military idiot of that time was General Westmoreland, who made more wrong decisions than a billionaire at a casino who leaves penniless. The political idiot at that time was Richard Nixon, who ironically, was elected to end the Vietnam War, but only extended it. I was fortunate; I only wasted three years of my life for that useless travesty. Others were far less fortunate; they lost their lives or were badly wounded. What a terrible waste.

175,4 May 2006,VicTheDaddy,10, Important truths,"I was surprised how any one could criticise this film,I've always believed this to be one of the greatest anti war films ever made,it is so powerful.It was first shown on British TV in the early 80s,and before it was shown it had been announced that it was banned in France,i don't know if it still is,but they were not happy about this film,this maby why it was late being shown on British TV,after all our British Generals had our soldiers executed on ridiculous charges,so we cant be hypercritical.About 300 British soldiers were executed, the French about twice the amount,so this film is really important,and Stanley Kubrick was probably the first director to pick up on these terrible injustices.In Britain we have had campaigners trying to pardon our men,because the sad thing is their families at the time or their descendant's at the moment can not march pass at the centopath on Remembrance Sunday as where the soldiers were executed this is not allowed,and yet the majority of these men were executed for falling a sleep while on duty,one example that springs to mind was of a soldier who was executed for refusing to put on a wet cap,he was executed for insubordination.Paths of Glory really does open peoples eyes to what these poor soldiers were up against during WW1 as there are a lot of people out there who still don't realize what went on .For a 1957 film this is very harrowing stuff,you know that once the three men are going on trial their fate is already sealed they haven't a chance in hell.And the worst part about it all is that the French Generals actually believe the men had a fair trial,its all ludicrous but sadly true.I believe this film did get people more interested in learning more about WW1 as there were many cover ups and many untold truths like the amount of British soldiers bodies that keep being unearthed in France and Belgium at the rate of about 7 a year and sometimes as many as 20-30,our government kept this quiet for years,so it seems that WW1 is destined not to be forgotten.",

Defending them is idealistic Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas), who finds himself facing an indifferent and callous court as well as cynical, self-centered senior officers. Kubrick's camera work is outstanding, with long, fluid tracking shots of officers walking through the trenches, stopping to both congratulate and berate the exhausted men. The battle scenes, as the infantry struggle though the shell craters, barb wire and bodies of no-man's land, are masterful, as is the beautiful, poignant imagery of the long walk to the execution site. The cast and script are equally excellent. George Macready plays Gen. Mireau as a heartless, self-aggrandising martinet while Adolphe Menjou's cynical Gen. Broulard, while more thoughtful, comes across as even more pernicious. The three soldiers (Ralph Meeker, Joe Turkel and Timothy Carey) who find themselves being scapegoated for the poor military decisions of their leaders are also excellent: at times weak, at times strong, and the dialogue between soldiers (such as the discussion of death by bayonet vs. shell vs bullet) has a feeling of authenticity often lacking in war-films. The film has an interesting release history: it strong anti-war message and criticism of both military mentality and military justice, got it banned in a number of venues, especially France.

He practically invented the anti-war genre with this film or at least made the first nationally recognized anti-war film.  His four major anti-war films could even fit the traditional genre cycle model.   ""Paths of Glory"" being his first anti-war film established the genre and thus was its novelty period.  His next anti-war film was ""Spartacus"" and this could be the classic period of the genre.  Next was ""Dr Strangelove or: how I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb"" and this could be the revisionist period of the genre in which it takes a comedic turn.  Lastly was ""Full Metal Jacket"" which could fulfill the parodic period of the genre as it makes fun of itself.  These 4 films might have better fit the genre cycle if ""Dr. Strangelove"" was made after ""Full Metal Jacket"" but I'm not sure.  Anyway, it's a very interesting view of the four movies if you compare them. ",
182,27 August 2003,Angry_Arguer,6, Elaboration,"While Paths of Glory is certainly one of Kubrick's best (it certainly ranks above The Shining and Full Metal Jacket), it is only an elaboration on the darker aspects of Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front.  Such concepts as cowardice, insubordination, and prejudice are thrown in to keep things different, but Kubrick can't help hiding that fact.",
183,16 January 2018,travisyoung,10, Which Path Will You Take?,"War produces the true natures of men: some lose their humanity altogether and become monsters, while others embrace a kind of moral courage that cannot be defined or explained.

185,7 March 2006,fowler-16,10, One to Remember,"This film is a treasure. I first saw it in the local movie house in Ashland, Oregon, in my second season with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. The theater owner screened it for one night only, I believe, as an ""art film"" that might appeal to a small off-beat crowd. The whole Shakespeare company showed up, and we were enthralled by the acting and stunned and moved by Kubrick's lean, masterful story of an historical cover-up perpetrated by autocratic generals in collusion with lower-ranking opportunists and cowards. Based on a blatant miscarriage of justice in the French army of World War I, the film had a powerful impact on our generation--in the post-Korea, pre-Vietnam era. It is a classic indictment of the corruption of men in war. I believe it holds up very well and that no one who sees it at the right time of their life will ever forget it.",
186,6 March 2021,elision10,5," OK, but why so adored?","Well, another movie that everyone seems to love and I don't. It's all right, but certainly nothing that deserves such accolades. There's no subtlety, everything is flashed to you in big black letters. The villains are so villanous, the heroes so heroic, and the downtrodden soldiers so downtrodden that there's little suspense. Kirk Douglas can be great as he was in Ace in the Hole; but here he is the high-minded, flawless man that becomes more irritating than admirable. The ending is highly effective, but that for me was the only highlight.",

Cinematography, acting, script, everything is perfect. Kubrick and Kirk Douglas's partnership gave us to of the best movies ever made, Spartacus and Paths of Glory, and both were able to discuss political issues deeply and seriously while accomplishing amazing artistic achevements with historical events as background. When France and Germany fought each other in WWI, the film is clear about who was the bad side: those who gave orders, all the others are victims. It ia not only one of the best war movies ever but also one of the best court films. The movie was already remarkable until the latest scene, which changed its status from excellent to absolutely brilliant. That perfect scene shows another important lesson: dehumanizing is necessary to make wars, otherwise nobody would do something so dire.",

190,26 July 2010,markbellamy,9, Not really a war movie,"In reading other reviews I see a lot of them saying this was one of the finest ""war movies"" ever made. I agree that it is one of the finest movies but I do not believe it is a war movie. The war is merely the backdrop for the drama that is human politics, selfishness and greed. The backdrop could be a corporate board room, any place in government, anywhere in which a bureaucratic system is in place with little accountability at the top. The lessons in this film extend far beyond the battlefield. I would say it is a must see to anyone interested in movies about moral inconsistencies, abuse of power, and the realities of the way the world operates.",
191,26 November 2019,davidmvining,10," Okay,...This kid from New York has real talent.","This is Stanley Kubrick's first great film, and it has the kind of emotional punch that many find sorely missing from his overall oeuvre.

192,6 November 2006,ennyman,10, Early Kubrick film displays his profound skills of storytelling in film in remarkable and poignant World War One film.,"I have placed this early Kubrick anti-war statement on my top ten list both for its originality, great acting, compelling story line, plot twists, and surprisingly beautiful and inspired ending. This one is a heart-breaker account of a moment in history that repeated itself endlessly in that horrific bloodfest called the trenches of World War I. To some extent Kubrick returned to the theme in various ways with Full Metal Jacket, but Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax is perfect here, demonstrating the challenge of maintaining honor within a system that has turned values on its head. It is a crisis in the life and career of Colonel Dax, who has lived by the watchword of Duty with a capital D throughout his career, but has remained idealistic and faithful to his men. The army's absurd effort to capture ""the Anthill"" results in a tear in the fabric of his idealism. The ugliness he sees is an eye opener for both Dax and the audience, who sees the truth with tragic clarity.",
193,30 July 2005,Captain_Couth,9, The World of Stanley Kubrick: The Paths of Glory.,"Pathes of Glory (1957) has to be one of the greatest anti-war films ever made.

194,8 November 2013,Arriflex1,10, Stanley Kubrick: His First Masterpiece,"PATHS OF GLORY: Here, Kubrick establishes an important thematic component that is present in many of his great films. The idea of entrenched authority answerable only to itself and running amok with cruel insensitivity would seem like the fearful concerns of a paranoiac except that Kubrick is informed by reality. The film is named after and based on Humphrey Cobb's 1935 novel which was based on actual events, making Kubrick's depiction of the sadistic generals unassailable. Their ill-advised forays into the battlefield are horrifying. When their folly turns into unimaginable tragedy we enter the realm of the demented. Willing to maintain their status and power at a terrible human cost the depraved military leaders persecute brave men who are guilty only of following orders. From a moral stance, the viewer is poised to watch hopefully as one man steps forward to begin the search for truth and the fight for justice. ",
195,1 October 2016,PetarNeo,10, Great war story,"Kubrick is definitely one of the greatest movie directors and it also shows us here what he's capable of. As one of the characters is driven by the mad will for promotion he commands an attack that has completely killed the whole squad and then he tries to turn things around and blame it on three guys. It was just outrageous how they got sentenced to death and it all goes down as officers try to do everything what they can to get Staff in sparing those man, but he is just trying to get everyone to believe him. Those man are executed, next morning it all goes down as Mireau finds out about how he was set up and thing starts unravel what every office desired to accomplish. It was shown how everybody wants something in war but also some want what is best for their man and some will do anything when they are offered right thing. Ending scene is absolutely magnificent and you can't help but to start getting overwhelmed and getting sense that everything is going to be all right. 3.5/4",
196,22 July 2019,PWNYCNY,6, Not that good. The movies fails to make a case against the general.,"It is World War One. France is fighting Germany. The Germans occupy a certain hill. Higher command ordered Mireau to take the hill, Mireau obeys, devises a plan to take the hill, knowing that casualties will be high, and gives the order to move out. Some soldiers move out, then (without orders) retreat and some stay in the trenches. To get the soldiers to obey, Mireau even orders French artillery to deliberately shell the troops. What a mess. Of course, the attack fails. Mireau refuses to accept responsibility for the failed attack and blames the failure on the troops for refusing to obey orders. Mireau orders one hundred soldiers to be immediately executed for cowardice, but is persuaded to reduce that number to three. Three soldiers, each one an enlisted man, are selected. A court martial is quickly convened, finds the three soldiers guilty of cowardice in the face of the enemy. and sentence them to execution by firing squad. The next day the order os carried out. the movie attempts to depict the three soldiers as victims of an nasty and incompetent general who uses the court martial to cover his own incompetency. The movie tries to depict Mireau as the villain and the three soldiers as his hapless victims. Kirk Douglas stars as Colonel Dax, Mireau's chief of staff and the person responsible for leading the attack, who is the personification of righteous indignation. The movie fails to make a case against Mireau. At the court martial, one soldier admits that he never left the trench, another that he moved out only to the French barbed wire, and the third that he retreated without being ordered. The movie makes a case that the the three soldiers were afforded less than adequate due process but fails to make a case that Mireau was a villain. First, the troops refused to obey his orders. Second, selecting individual solders for collective punishment was standard practice at the time. Third. higher command knew that the attack would result in lots of casualties. Fourth, Colonel Dax, who was the officer placed in charge of the actual attack, failed to rally the troops. Fifth, Mireau was doing his job. Sixth, it was war. Seventh, Mireau's orders were lawful. Eighth, if anyone should have been assigned blame, it was Colonel Dax whoi harbored personal animus toward General Mireau. Kirk Douglas received top billing, but the principal character was General Mireau, played by George Macready. The movie was about injustice - against a General who was set up to fail and then take the blame. UNFAIR.",
197,22 October 2005,PWNYCNY,6, Scapegoating is such a dirty business.,"This is a great movie. The story is compelling, the acting powerful, the theme sublime. This movie is about how the individual person can be reduced to the level of a mere statistic, a mere dot on somebody's organizational plan, a mere object to be sacrificed and never be missed by those in charge, who have their own personal agendas and will do ANYTHING to avoid taking responsibility when things go wrong. A military operation fails, and the general in charge is angry and he will not be the one stuck with the blame. As far as this general is concerned, the soldiers are a bunch of lazy, cowardly slackers who don't want to fight - even though the soldiers are dying by the thousands. But that is of no concern to the general who wants to blame someone for the failed operation because if the general takes responsibility he will be revealed for what he is: an egocentric, incompetent martinet who is interested in only one thing - furthering his career at the expense of the soldiers under his command. To pursue that selfish goal, this general will throw away the lives of the soldiers entrusted to him. This movie stars Kirk Douglas. But the real star of this movie is Adolph Menjou who plays the French general. On July 1, 1916, the British lost over 57,000 men killed or wounded while the Germans lost 8,000, with no appreciable gains, tactically or strategically. What an extravagant squandering of human life. But the generals in charge, who did the squandering, lived to fight another day.",

Usually I find there's some sort of gloss over the reality of the situation, and whilst here, there weren't mountains dismembered bodies and discarded heads, the emotion of the place was just so brilliantly conveyed. In the shots in which the camera glides through the trenches the emotion of every man is conveyed and felt, its seriously powerful. Though obviously not intentional, the fact that this film was in black and white actually helped it to feel more real somehow. That's probably just a personal opinion and its quite hard to explain but I just don't think the film actually would have been so effective if in full colour, it is far more a film of message and emotion than of beautiful scenery and an array of rainbow like effects.",

Then there is the film Paths of Glory directed by Stanley Kubrick. It could have been a grand World War I spectacle with a cast of thousands and sets rivaling the war itself. Instead, Kubrick brings us a story of a failed battle told from a personal side rather then the often used long shot of war, shown on a grand scale, so often used in lesser films.

Which returns me to my earlier point, that Paths Of Glory is not merely a war film nor an anti-war film. It is both, and revels in such. As French filmmaker Francois Truffaut aptly noted, all war films hold a power that makes calling them anti-war ridiculous. We can not be fully realized human beings without acknowledging that we love war and killing, and war films indulge this, even if they sometimes slip anti-war messages within them.

An ill advised attack resulted in some of the men of the French army not advancing when they were advised to. It was all a play for someone to move up in the army regardless of the casualties of those involved. Kirk Douglas's character was the highest officer involved in the attack so he took personal responsibility when three men were charged with the crime of cowardice and the penalty was death. He did what he could to get them out of it especially because each man was picked by officers regardless of if they exhibited cowardice or not. Some of it was personal. I think he did a good job.

These films are both about a historical event in World War 2. They don't form any opinion on war they just show what happened. War films about the soldiers themselves are different. They still showcase an event but these films express views on war. All Quiet on the Western Front(1930) comes to mind. Paths of Glory(1957) is sort of a mix. It's about both the commanders and the soldiers. It's about how the commanders treat the infantry men. It's about two generals General Paul Mireau(George MacReady) and General George Broulard(Adolphe Menjou) who want to take over the German anthill in World War 1. They plan to do this by using troops led by their leader Colonel Dax(Kirk Douglas). Colonel Dax does as he is ordered and he and his men attempt to storm the anthill. It goes horribly wrong and results in an unnecessary loss of men. The attack was suicide anyway. General Mireau is angry and orders his artillery to fire on Colonel Dax's troops. The order is refused so General Mireau blames the men for cowardice. Colonel Dax attempts unsuccsessfully to save his men from execution.

But it is equally true that war has been commented upon time immemorial on the big screen, sometimes with utter jingoism being involved (as is the case with many a John Wayne film), but usually with a ""Man's inhumanity to Man"" comment involved. Such is true of director Stanley Kubrick's 1957 film PATHS OF GLORY, set against the horrible backdrop of World War I and involving a criminal court-martial that, by itself, is even more horrible than the war itself.",

I haven't seen that many WWI movies in my life besides this movie and ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" which was from the German viewpoint, and the key difference with this movie in terms of the plot is that this movie presents the French point of view. Kirk Douglas stars in one of his finest performances as Colonel Dax a soldier who is in charge of group of soldiers tasked with the impossible task of taking the Ant Hill from the Germans and once he realizes the impossibility of the mission they're forced to retreat and General Paul Mireau (George Macready) the commanding officer present for the failed operation accuses Dax's battallion of cowardice in the face of the enemy and court martials them and only three soldiers can be tried and Dax himself volunteers to defend them in a trial rigged against them and are thus found guilty and sentenced to death by firing squad. I had been dying to see for years and it really exceeded my expectations as to how great it was going to be because I went into this thinking it was going to be a war movie that just focuses on the fighting but this movie is more than just fighting and loyalty to one's country. When Kirk Douglas accepted the AFI lifetime achievement award in 1991 he said that he used to believe that movies should be merely entertaining and not have a message and that belief gradually changed as he got older and believes that movies should make statements in order for the betterment of mankind. The movie is a movie effectively hones its message of war being hell for the soldiers that fight in them andsometimes even in impossible odds get punished even though they were trying to serve their country which rarely happens in any country's military. The movie is one of the most well acted and well made anti-war statements ever put on film along with ""Platoon"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" and is one of the very best movies of the late 1950'.",

251,30 May 2005,non_sportcardandy,1, nine out of ten times I won't watch a war movie,"The one and only reason that I wanted to see this movie was to see Tim Carey. A few articles have stated he was somewhat of a character and that Kirk Douglas became annoyed with him more than once during the filming of this picture. Seems as though Carey was accused of scene stealing especially during the long dragged out firing squad sequence. His waling's and carrying on seemed to bother the star of the movie. For that reason when Douglas was shown scowling while Carey was protesting during his death march it made me laugh,I figured he really was angry at Carey. In all fairness the scene stealing rap on Carey doesn't seem correct. Check out the distance from headquarters to the spot where the prisoners are going to be shot,it looks like a quarter of a mile. Some guy that feels he hasn't done anything wrong is taking a long walk to drums seeing those death posts draw closer oh so slowly,it's not surprising if he was beside himself. Without Carey's moaning the scene would start to fringe on boring. This movie gets a high rating from many persons even though it seems like the actions of the commanding officer go unexplained by the movie makers. Maybe I missed something but this is what puzzles...first the commanding officer states that the lost of one of his men is far more important than any promotion and he seems very serious about it. By the time he does an inspection of the trenches he is an unexplained different person,all business,without feeling for the battle weary. From there he gets worse,still unexplained he wants victory at all cost,which means bombing your own men. Then when accused of this he says it never happened.

The bosses have run out of ideas. They don't know what to do.

I was 17, I'd seen a few (thousand) movies, and I soon realized that I'd been seeing it all my life: cowboys shooting Indians, Indians shooting cavalry, cops shooting robbers, good guys shooting bad guys, weak guys shooting strong guys, Japanese and Germans and Americans shooting one another - it was a staple of the cinema.

The scene's that follow have been analysed many times but the scene that I think stands up so well is the final scene between Col Dax and Gen Broulard where Dax is accused of engineering the situation for his own personal gain.

It is more than just an anti-war war story; unlike any other war flick I can think of it shows that soldiers faced peril not only from the enemy but from their officers as well, and portrays the whole business of war as corrupt. In this, an egomaniac general, dreaming of becoming a national hero, sends his troops on a hopeless attack. When they are pinned down and forced to turn back, he blames them and several soldiers are chosen to be executed for cowardice. Kirk Douglas is excellent as the one of the few good guys in the bunch, who fights to save the lives of his men.

Made before he had perfected his unique signature, it has a raw, semidocumentary, almost cinema verite quality that distinguishes it from the more distant, formal films of Kubrick's maturity. Just compare it to ""Full Metal Jacket,"" made exactly thirty years later. The film is short (less than an hour and a half) and there's no soundtrack aside from the relentless drum rolls. Kirk Douglas, whom I have often found hammy in other films, is perfect here as Colonel Dax, the sole voice of moral rectitude in a tale of double dealing, casual cruelty and Machiavellian intrigue. He's well-matched by his opponents: the deceptively suave Adolphe Menjou (the only Frenchman in the film) and the deranged Charles Macready. Interestingly, Menjou was one of Hollywood's premiere red-baiters, and played a key role in driving Chaplin from America. He plays a similar character here, and one wonders if he appreciated the irony. The black-and-white photography adds to the film's no-frills atmosphere. This film was considered so inflammatory that Kubrick was forbidden to shoot in France, and instead it was filmed in Germany, with German policemen doubling as French soldiers. ""Paths of Glory"" was a commercial failure, but it led to Kubrick's second collaboration with Douglas, 1960's ""Spartacus,"" which gave Kubrick the box-office clout he needed to make his later masterpieces.

300,7 January 2012,Artimidor,10, A pearl washed ashore by the tide of war,"There are lots of so-called anti-war films out there, which focus on showing the inhumanity of war by pointing the camera at soldiers who are shot, blown up, mutilated, that sort of thing. Often these movies lack the necessary reflection related to the shown violence, and assume that this already takes care of itself, and this is a really sad story. The result may lead the phenomenon that some people enjoy such movies because of what they see, not what the film is meant to be about. And thus it might be safer to call such movies ""war films"" rather than ""anti-war"". Well, ""Paths of Glory"" is different. It focuses on the individuals, the executors in the command chain, on those, who are forced to make decisions about life and death, those, who have to survive or make achievements against all odds, who therefore use others to save face.",

Exasperated by the stalemate, the French supreme commander orders Colonel Dax's troops to do the impossible – launch a suicidal assault on a strategic hill – the Anthill. Even though he thinks the idea sounds insane, Dax is in no position to decline the directive and commands his men to charge to their likely doom. The soldiers are indeed like ants on the Anthill, stomped mercilessly by larger unseen forces. When the operation ends in inevitable retreat, their commanding general, himself largely responsible for the fiasco, wants an entire company to face execution. France needs a sacrifice, as if it hadn't bled enough. Eventually, three men are chosen at random to face court-martial for 'cowardice', as an example to others. The decision brings Dax, himself a defense lawyer in peacetime, into conflict with his superior officers, as he tries to assert reason during wartime for those on trial against an apathetic panel of military judges, even as the three men await execution. Can Colonel Dax save the men from the trumped-up charges of pusillanimity and eventually from the firing squad?",

The only issue I have with this otherwise perfect war-as-depressing-bureaucratic-hell play is the all-too quick transition from the war zone to the trial scene.

The evil of the generals who ordered a meaningless suicide charge and their horrible manipulations stands for itself, but most meaningful to me is the overall administrative smugness projected, a personification of all those involved in running a war, any war, who are not themselves doing the fighting.  The setting of a court martial hearing with Dax (Kirk Douglas--boy, has anybody ever been better?) defending the three soldiers serves well to dramatize the issues, the basic antiwar theme, which climaxes with the final scene, the apotheosis of the horror and absurdity of war, ranking with Rosebud among the all-time greats.",

This movie is not really a war movie, and it's not really a court room drama.  It's just a really good human drama film.

The orders are never carried out but army loses the campaign. The general can't take the defeat and asks colonel to pick three men from each battalion and court marshals them.

That is simply astonishing to me...a man who wasn't even 30 is credited for making Paths of Glory, not only one of the best war films ever made, but one of the most compelling and ferociously angering films ever. Kubrick's ability to make the evil of characters so blatantly obvious and yet so subtle is brilliant, playing tricks on our mind and making us really think about what is happening. Kubrick is dark and intense, and that is why his films are so good.

When they obviously fail, the General afraid of losing face for a stupid decision decides to court martial some of the soldiers as a punishment. Three soldiers are singled out. One obviously fought very bravely and another was hit on the head and knocked unconscious during the battle. Their stories are futile against the kangaroo French military court. Douglas tries valiantly to act as their legal council and present their defense in vain. From what I understand this film is still banned in France! I guess the humiliating loss during WWII did nothing to sway the French military from its self-conceived notion of being a great military power!",

With its subtle variations in tone and temperament, Paths of Glory evokes a broad spectrum of emotions in its relatively sparse running time, ranging from ridicule and amusement to suspense, anger, sorrow and, ultimately, a glimpse of hope. This is certainly one of Kubrick's most economical movies, and it's remarkably well-made. Every scene and segment is tight, telling and technically proficient. Kubrick creates realistic scenes of battle with very simple means and is able to make the more academic subject matter in the second half of the film come alive and feel palpable, well helped by a passionate Kirk Douglas. Paths of Glory was a bold film, aesthetically and artistically. And like most of Kubrick's films, it holds up remarkably well. It's still one of his best. The evocative score is by Gerald Fried.",

While with ""Full Metal Jacket"", Stanley demonstrated the absurdity of war by focusing on all the traumas of those who live it, with ""Paths of Glory"" he denounces the politics of those who lead it. He presented in this film an authentic and scandalous incident that occurred within the French army during the First World War, and he served it with a powerful, cold and horrifying realism. Also the absence of the enemy (we didn't see any Germans) was uncustomary at the time. For the technical aspect, the work of cinematography had a huge impact on this picture, the Camera movements made the story more dynamic on the battlefield sequences and more static in the headquarters sequences.

The script was excellent, the story-line was brief and concise and the whole casting ensemble was marvelous. The best thing about the movie was, the singing from the German girl at the end sequence.

Some nice b&w photography, a few good lines and a couple of interesting set pieces are wasted in this predictable bore . As for its anti-war message, it's heavy handed and preachy. Dr. Strangelove is infinitely more effective. I find it astonishing to read comments claiming that this is one of Kubrick's best.

343,14 March 2021,judemcrobbie,8, Not Bad nor Kubrick's Best,"The highest rated Stanley Kubrick film somehow. Compare this to some of the most iconic movies ever (The Shining, 2001, Barry Lyndon, Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange: the list goes on) this is relatively unknown about.
To touch on the visuals still, the black and white nature of the film doesn't help but the subtlety of the cinematography helps the movies a lot as the little hints of theme throughout (As with Full Metal Jacket, it's clear the theme is that of a serious distaste of war, much like the majority of war films). These hints are the lack of narrow, personal shots making for dehumanised characters; and the few narrow close ups there are always focus on the war badges again reducing the soldiers to their rank, merit or battalion.
It doesn't have the century defining visuals of any of the others, nor the iconic plot, but compared to the rest of his movies it is incredibly wrote. Whereas the majority of his movies are long-standing because of the psychological torment the movie places on you, this (while having a sense of torture) is far funnier and is written and framed like a comedy, through hilarious writing and the obscene ideas of the generals, clearly taking inspiration from the slapstick comedy of Charlie Chaplin. On the note of the absurdity of the movie, very few characters are explicitly named: often characters will go out of their way to not name them, not only making it humorous but also the anonymity ties into the dehumanisation.
The tracking shots that, may as well be known as the Kubrick shot, make a cinematic debut in this film as he had not quite mastered it yet and it still brings a joy to watch.
Considering the mammoth lengths of other war films, this clocks in at 87 minutes but the suffocating pace of this movie helps it to extend that run tins into what feels like an eternity the pacing works beautifullly for this in three separate ways: firstly, it helps us feel the time these soldiers in the trenches and the men awaiting the firing squad are feeling. Just like birdman and 1917, them being one shot and this being long holding shots with the aforementioned tracking shot, they feel much longer than their respective run times and we feel it in this too. Secondly, the suffocating pace helps to feel the suffocating nature of the war and how there is no way out. And thirdly, to help amplify points. These are usually to empathasise with the ptsd soldiers as they feel everything wiring around them in an otherwise fast paced environment.",

349,4 May 2019,maue-19674,9, Kubrick's Masterpiece on the utter folly and horror of war,"Very few Films have ever quite captured the true misery and horrors of the First World War. Having studied Military History, I had always imagined the I would never see a film that would portray the awful conditions, the sheer waste of mens lives and the terror of a n attack by Infantry against machine guns and artillery. Then, I saw Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory' and sat stunned through a film that avoids the usual Hollywood 'heroics' and shows us the 'human' side of this conflict - from the French High Command, most of whose Officers are drawn from the wealthy classes - and who hardly care about the scale of the casualties, Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) an Officer who deeply cares about his men and who doesn't wish to expose them to unnecessary danger, to the ordinary soldiers - just carrying out their duty - and trying to come out alive. Shot in Black and White, which really gives and authentic look to the trenches, Kubrick's tracking shots as the Officers walk down the trenches hoping to 'spread morale', show you the soldiers 'eye-view' - with incessant shell-fire throughout. What makes 'Paths Of Glory' such a powerful film is the sheer idiocy - and almost childish - reactions of the most senior French Officers. The Court Martial scene shows this more than anywhere else - the 'verdict' has already been decided and, as such, the Court is a farce, simply there to verify the wishes of the Commanding Officer.
The main attack against the 'Ant Hill' is one of the most brilliant, and accurate, depictions of such an assault in the First World War. All through the film the 'enemy' are never seen - not a single German Soldier is ever shown. The Irony being that the final scene, where the French troops are drinking and singing before returning to the front, shows a frightened German girl, who is forced to sing for the Troops. As she slowly, and faltering, sings a sad, melancholy, song from home, the troops stop their initial hostility and begin to hum along - painfully aware that soon, they too will return to the hell of the trenches.
Kubrick's film is one of the very best Films about any war and is amongst my favourite films of all time. Highly recommended",

352,19 November 2014,BlueFairyBlog,10, Glory Glory,"This is the true story of how those in power took advantage of it and put three innocent soldiers on the stand for cowardice, during World War I. One of Kubrick's earlier classics, this film deals with the savagery of violence, and how the common people are made to fight others' wars. The visuals are so empowering, and the film hits you right in the gut with its emotional prowess. The lives of these men are decided by the higher powers and their decision making, over what is just. Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas) tries to save the lives of the three men in question but he has to fight against bureaucracy time and time again. Even when he has a chance to right the injustice he is thwarted by his government and unfair officials, who fight them in purely evil and sadistic ways. We don't know until the final moment whether or not the three men will be saved, and it's a long and painfully aware scene. The very ending, with the German girl in the bar, singing a familiar tune, sparked such a human empathy within myself that it made me cry. A very emotional and quintessentially moving film, it's obvious that Kubrick has made the seminal war film.",
353,2 June 2014,matic-boh1,8, A thought-provoking critique of the military,"Not only does one get an opportunity to appreciate brilliant directing and stunning cinematography, Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory also examines highly significant themes of morality and integrity, making it a very powerful and truly great film. By focusing on the exploits of the French army during the years of the First World War, Kubrick successfully manages to expose flaws within the military system, highlighting the immoral behavior of the commanding officers, as well as the unjust treatment of the soldiers. Kirk Douglas' terrific acting skills are on display in the leading role, as he portrays a colonel that challenges the conduct of his superior officers, thus epitomizing the ideas of justice and ethical behaviour. Due to its flawless execution, the film serves as a very thought-provoking critique of the military and again proves Kubrick's distinct ability to confront delicate themes with a simple, yet impactful approach. Paths of Glory is perhaps the most realistic cinematic portrayal of the grueling trench warfare endured by millions during the Great War, and undoubtedly one of Kubrick's finest.",

355,8 July 2000,plsj,10, Kirk Douglas's best movie,This is my second favorite war movie behind all quiet on the western front. This I think is Stanley Kubrick's best movie. Kirk Douglas is excellent as colonel Dax.I think this should have gotten the academy award for best picture in 1957.Overall 10/10,
356,10 July 2002,Evolvist,9, Always Needed,"What is amazing, and given that it was made in 1957, is the almost complete lack of ""cheese"" that this movie could have had. ""Paths of Glory"" was way ahead of its time as a war movie: a semi-film noir masterpiece that shows Kubrick stretching his wings and getting a real feel for the world outside of Leave It To Beaver. However, thank the great acting, as well, that carries this movie. Although the groups of actors, including the great Kirk Douglas, never even attempts to try out a French accent; nevertheless, the whole cast does a great job, and only a few times do the actors get carried away into some ""stage theatrics"" that was common in the movies of this time period.  But, we need WWI movies like this, and I am almost ashamed that I had not seen it until now. The photography is beautiful, as well as the realistic battle scenes, and please take special note of even how the soldiers wore their facial hair back in 1916. Everything looks authentic and down to the wire. Even the extras in the film are shown how they really were in the French enlisted army of that time: a mixture of all ages, from very young to men in their 50s. The complete absence of showing the Germans? The enemy is truly within! I could go on about this flick: from the walking down the trench scene, to the photographs of grand halls and architecture, but I will end here, and just say to watch this film, even if you are not a fan of ""old"" movies. Almost a 10!",

358,20 January 2005,ed56,10, Stanley Kubirck and Kirk Douglas at their very best!,"Stanley Kubrick's 1957 masterpiece is a movie that looks fresh and sharper than most of today's movies. The story follows the french army during the days of the first world war. General George Boulard (Adolphe Menjou) has an impossible mission for his subordinate Gen. Paul Mireau (a vicious George Macready) who knows the high risk of such mission but takes it because he was promised to get another star after accomplishing the mission. The mission is to take on the ""Ant Hill"", a territory that for some reason is valuable to the high ranks. Kirk Douglas plays the part of The field commander Col. Dax, a man who unlike his fellow officers, has a decency towards his soldiers but can't save them from the cruelty lack of justice of the military system which is built only to protect the commanding officers. There are some cynical and sharp dialogs (something that's often missing from todays movies) delivered perfectly by all actors. Kirk Douglas is in top form here and brings a memorable performance. There isn't any dull or wasted moments here, every scene is significant and will keep you glued to your seat. Overall it's a fascinating classic that is well worth watching. Highly Recommended 10/10",

From the opening to the ending, I was completely gripped by what I was watching on screen; in terms of 'you-are-there' war-reality, then the combat scenes in this film stand parallel to All Quiet On the Western Front, Stalingrad, Saving Private Ryan etc. There are echoes of Kubrick's later Full Metal Jacket at one point, and the generally anti-war, pacifist message in the film is certainly a powerful one that emotionally involves the spectator. Halliwell's Film Guide describes this as 'overpowering cinema', and I couldn't agree more; for the time this film was made, I don't think it could have been realised any more effectively! If you feel sympathy for the lot of the common man who is caught up in the madness of the war-machine, then this is a film for you! Highly recommended...",

Here we see Kubrick establishing his knack for realising beautiful cinematic landscapes and giving depth to characters through the mise-en-scène. In many scenes, a character's position within the frame defines his level of power  men of lower ranks are visually lower down than their superiors, individuals are cut off from their peers by borders in the background. Perhaps the most conspicuous example of this is when the three accused soldiers are on trial. When each individual soldier is questioned, he is framed in a medium close-up, with his superiors a fair distance behind him. This allows us to relate more to him, as he is essentially nearer to us than the others.",

It made little impact at the Oscars that year, and never shows up on things like the AFI 100 Years 100 Movies list, but it's great that IMDB users have placed it so high in the Top 250.  That inspired me to see it, and hopefully will many others.  For those who don't know, it's about an impossible attack during World War I that fails, and how the piggish army generals make three innocent subordinates the scapegoats and have them sentenced to death.  The movie is absolutely heart-wrenching without having to resort to the slightest bit of manipulation; I found myself wanting to lash out at the screen at times because I was so furious at the injustice of the matter.  Adolphe Menjou really sinks his teeth into the role of the main heavy, and Kirk Douglas is just exceptional as the angry officer fighting futilely for justice.  The interactions between the two of them are among the best dramatic scenes you will find anywhere, and the trial is horrifying, and yet so gripping.  At times such as the final scene, the movie is too poignant at times for me to even do justice with words.  All I can say is SEE IT!  It's a 10/10!!!!",

I defy even the toughest and most hardened person to not shed a tear in the final scene in the bar with the soldiers.

I found myself losing focus ever so slightly in the beginning as it took just a little bit to gain momentum. But that's perfectly fine as it's Kubrick's style to take his time. It's worth it.

By the nature of their work, generals use common soldiers like pawns but in this story the generals employ them with arrogance and disdain.

The whole question about how movies hold up over time seems to always be a ripe subject for discussion (and I think misunderstandings). ""Paths Of Glory"" was released in 1957 and I suppose was slightly ahead of its time--Of course within the next 15 years movies like Catch-22 and M*A*S*H would bring their own anti-war messages -""Paths of Glory"" was banned in France until 1975--otherwise I don't think it upset or offended many others at the time. It's a bit more candid than ""All Quiet on the Wesern Front"" --however that movie was released back in 1930 (do the math). ""Paths Of Glory"" holds up well not because the theme or particulars are that new or outrageous---but only because it is so well and clearly told (thank you Mr. Kubrick).

He comes across as overtly American, the sort who would be leading the invasion at Omaha Beach in WW2. In one scene he even quotes Franklin, an American Statesman - now no French Officer from WW1 would be quoting an American - he'd of course be quoting some Famous Frenchy, Voltaire for example.

Whether or not this was Kubrick's intention, the very human story of these French troops puts forth the message that war is not the answer. Vanity and the lust for power and prestige make the goals of even a just war unattainable. WW II shows us that the losers just go and regroup and plot revenge. What may be the most poignant, touching moment in cinema history is the scene at the end where the French soldiers are treated to entertainment by a Bavarian, Fraulein singer in a local tavern. When she comes out on the stage, the soldiers at first begin to jeer and make sexually charged statements that demean the woman and cause her obvious fear. But, when she begins to sing, the whole room suddenly becomes silent. Every soldier suddenly becomes emotionally touched, even overwhelmed, by the haunting beauty of the melody.

Don't get me wrong...I love Mr. Douglas, however I think an unknown would have been better in this role. Mostly because all through the movie I could not help but think it was a Kirk Douglas movie. All the other performances were stellar, especially Ralph Meeker, and George Mccreedy. Kubrick was pure genius. His use of Black and White made the moods in this movie what they were......stark. The war scenes were graphic and brutal pulling no punches. The firing squad execution scenes made me squirm. All in all probably the best antiwar flick made.",
408,28 July 1999,"No,Dave",9, Kirk Douglas' true colours,"While Douglas acts as the voice of blinkered liberalism, he shows up the reactionary superiors for what they are - armchair soldiers, more afraid of mice than Mausers. It's a poignant scene when Douglas attempts to lead a second charge, only to be forced back into the trench by the deadweight of one of his fallen comrades. Also the ending, in which a female species of the enemy is brought out on stage to howls of derision, only for her to move the soldiers to tears with a half-hummed tune that crosses borders, and appeals to the pre-war human in them all. While they never got the anthill, Douglas and the three guilty are the real heroes, and the silent majority of the soldiers the real victims.",
409,27 December 2020,bjorn.hakansson,8," A classic, but less spectacular than expected","I have had this movie on my watchlist for a long time, and when I finally could see it I enjoyed the excellent acting, the scenography and many of the interesting scenes, displaying many of the worst things about war: the multitude of meaningless ways that people lose their lives. Sadly I had expected more, maybe some twist in the story or a more satisfying ending. The first two thirds of the movie felt like it was building up to some finishing drama that never really came. Maybe that makes the film more realistic, but also less entertaining. All in all; a classic film worth watching, but keep your expectations on a moderate level.",
410,14 January 2002,mpr-1,9, Better than Full Metal Jacket because its based on an actual event.,"This film would have been chilling enough had it just been fiction but since its actually based around a similar event in WWI it is indeed very sad. Well acted and superbly written I'd class this as a must see not only for history buffs but for anybody who has wondered about the senseless tactics employed in WWI. If you are not a 'war movie' fan then don't be put off - this film is not your traditional gungho fare. Deliberately you are never shown the germans for they are not the real enemy in this movie. The dialogue, although very intelligently written is still believable and how men actually talk and not all poetic and deep which was my biggest gripe with 'Thin Red Line'.  I usually guage how good a film is by how successfully it conjures up your different emotions - at the end of Paths of Glory you'll feel saddened, angry and dismayed.",
411,26 May 2023,mood_flow,10, A Harrowing Examination of War and Power in Paths of Glory,"Paths of Glory, directed by the legendary Stanley Kubrick, presents us with a harrowing and chilling examination of the hypocrisy of the upper echelons in the face of war, contrasting starkly with the grim realities faced by the common soldiers.",
412,10 September 2008,bgaffney,10, paths of glory,In 1958 a high school English teacher's made this movie a class assignment. He was also a pilot in the Marine Corps reserves. I went I saw and it conquered. Many people consider this the best war movie ever made however these days many do not like it anti-war they think bias. It not just a war movie but it is a work of art. Many may not know this but this is based on a true story. It was good that when U.S. troops landed in France that General Pershing did not allow our troops to be placed under french command. I served in the United States Marine Corps in the 60s and I love it's antiwar bias!This movie ranks right up there with Pork Chop Hill and other war movies of that period.,
413,24 July 2007,hooligan5,10, Devastating!,"This is one of the most heartbreaking films ever made! It was probably ahead of its time when it came out... or maybe the critics and the public back then simply couldn't handle the truth! George Macready, with that creepy facial scar was epitome of high-ranking military hubris, while Adolphe Menjou also willfully blind to his own arrogant pride...! The military brass turned a deaf ear to Kirk Douglas' words...so their silence would drown out the sound of gunfire and the condemned mens' screams. Kirk Douglas is solid here - you wish you could speak your mind to your boss like he does! I can't say enough about the rest of the cast: the great Ralph Meeker breaks your heart here! Wacky Tim Carey as the one of the other condemned soldiers delivers a solid performance. Of course, the last scene in the movie where the only girl in the movie (Suzanne Christian) slowly changes the mood in the café with her little song! One of the greatest movies of all time!",
414,10 December 2020,rounakc2k,10, Do you want a blindfold ?,It's the year 2020 and this year has given me enough time to watch all of Stanley Kubrick's movies. But this movie especially reaches out to me in a unique way. This is not your typical war movie where the allies win and celebrate their victory. But where they depict how even the allies have a dirty side to their army. Although based on a true story. It's a masterpiece because this war movie is not just any war movie. This war movies holds an emotional value. How each soldiers motive and inclination towards the war is so different from one another. Do not watch this movie looking for an action war movie or a movie which holds great story value. But it holds an immense sentimental value to it. Watch the movie only if you are an ardent movie fan who sees movies for more than the story which it provides.,
415,29 May 2000,JJHLH1,10, One of the greatest films ever made.,"'Paths of Glory' is a masterpiece directed by Stanley Kubrick when he was still in his 20's.  This film demonstrates that a tight plot and strong characters are infinitely more important than special effects, gratuitous violence, profanity, and sex.  Don't get me wrong, if the latter are use sparingly and judiciously then they can add a lot to a movie.  The problem with too many films produced today is that they rely on these devices as crutches to support what is otherwise and inferior plot/film.",
416,3 March 2001,melias,10," Kubrick's greatest ever, and I mean it!","Nothing comes near this one. Kubrick was just a few films down when he stumbled onto that script (true story). He must have been inspired as he managed, within minutes, to recreate the muddy trenches, the staunch smell of the fear of men, the inhumanity of the French officer corps (excluding Dax of course)and the dichotomy between the Château living conditions and those of the enlisted men. The so-called trial should be shown at movie schools. But certainly the most moving scene of them all has got to be the closing scene with Kubrick's real wife on stage. The song she is forced to sing to a bunch of men transformed into wild animals happens to be a song from both the German and the French Folk music (Marjolaine in French). They realize that after all, they are not so different from their archenemy, the hated Germans (Les Boches). An American Director capable of capturing the essence of WWI has got to be a genius, which of course Stanley Kubrick was.",

In this movie which is an excellent one, the Division is the 701 division. All the soldier's uniforms are embroidered with the 701 numbers on the collar. Kirk Douglas's uniform has it, the privates have it and all else in the 701. At about 55 minutes into the film when the big guy is briefing the soldiers about guard duty for the prisoners. The soldier on the extreme left, the very last guy or the very first guy closest to the camera has 710 embroidered on his collar. He is the guy with the thin mustache. Look closely and you see 710 as plain as day. I spotted that goof. Irfaan.",
420,12 August 2014,roxen_96,9, Some films never get old,"Kubrick never disappoints, or at least that seems to me! He can either make a film about the 1st World War, the exploration of the galaxy or a hotel full of metaphysical horrors, it does not matter, you will always find a great piece of art (but it doesn't mean you're gonna love it!) In this case, Kubrick shows us the sordid horrors of warfare thru a point of view of a colonel who hates the loss of humanity of his superiors, people who thinks and acts in a way totally different to the poor soldiers sent to die in the trenches. The best thing of the film is, doubtless, that Kubrick succeeds in making us hate war and everyone involved in his primary realization and organization...and in just one hour and a half! (Shortest Kubrick film I've ever seen).",
421,17 February 2014,ecosourcevent,9, The Sign of Brilliance to Come,"I won't bother to dissect the film, or to comment on its value as a statement of war, but rather to state this is a testament to the brilliant film making that marked the career of Stanley Kubrick. The greatness that was to come through his next films (Strangelove, 2001, Clockwork Orange) is on full display here. Its hard to imagine that we can enter this twisted world of war, where nonsensical episodes are commonplace, and yet we are not simply muted spectators, we are empathetic participants. This is Kubrick's genius. Making the bizarre and extraordinary seem almost mundane. ",
422,10 April 2015,aiello-alex,10, A Must See For Any Human Being,"I must admit, before Paths of Glory I had not seen many films set during WWI and only know what was taught in school. This movie however seems to agree with facts I had learnt which makes the movie all the more raw. From start to finish Paths of Glory is a gritty dramatization of what conflict looked like during WWI. The movie shows many layers of depth from inside the mansion of the bourgeoisie, all the way into the hearts and minds of the men fighting on the front. As a fan of other Kubrick's anti-war films I thought I had an idea of what to expect going into this film but once again Kubrick greatly exceeds all preparation. Bravo.",

428,18 May 2006,falconnect5887,10, Stanley Kubrick's Finest Ever!,"""Paths of Glory"" is probably the best Kubrick movie ever. It is rich in historical authenticity, powerful dialog, subtle ethical references and constant plot development. There really is never a dull moment in the flick - even the battle scenes are gripping. If it was in color, I would have given it an ""11""! Kirk Douglas (Col. Dax) is a convincing leader in this movie, deftly facing the moral conflicts as commander of a brave French infantry company. Ralph Meeker (Cpl. Paris) and Wayne Morris (Lt. Roget) weave a beautiful tension between soldier and officer - especially when they hate each other. The General Staff played by Adolphe Menjou (Gen. Broulard) and George Macready (Gen. Mireau) show the rampant hypocrisy that rages through all warmongers  that the blood and guts of the brave are expendable for the sake of ego and whimsy. But the best player yet is the German singer - the tune still echoes in my head... A must see for true movie enthusiasts - especially those with eclectic tastes! Especially fitting for this time when war burns globally...",
429,16 March 2023,pteodori-99612,9, This is certainly NOT an anti-war movie,"Today, Stanley Kubrick is largely remembered for three movies: His space epic, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968), His dystopian and ultra-violent vision of a future society, ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971), and his horror masterpiece, ""The Shining"" (1980).

430,23 August 2013,JohnnyJazz365,10," A Psychological, Introspective War Film With A Moral Lesson","A stirring condemnation of aristocracy and the hierarchical society that Europe was, Kubrick is very deliberate in framing the French command as self-serving, maniacal egomaniacs. Taking very loosely from a real historic event, the original author, playwright and screenwriter fashioned it into a telling damnation of those with no respect for human life and who so willingly abuse their power to dispose of it for their own purposes. Extremely heavy-headed, but soul stirring and wonderful all the same, a true masterpiece of film and a must see for anyone needing a reminder of how infrequently the true heroes of society are ever justly given their due. A masterpiece of satire, reinforcing the relationship of authority, establishment and the church working together to justify tremendously inhumane punishments and judgements. Kirk Douglas is absolutely stunning and the commanders stellar in presenting themselves oblivious to everything but their own ambitions and desire for glory.",

Beyond the watching Generals and members on the Press – where we might think power rests, lays the 300 metre long facade of the institution that has determined the fate of these men; the perfect, grand (Schleissheim) Palace stretches across the middle distance reminding us of who and where power lays, and what it means.",

434,4 August 2013,mightymouse821,10, Beautiful Artistry,"Kubrick offers us something of a glimpse into the injustice of the common solider with his movie Paths of Glory. We start of with a planed attack on the German army to be conducted by a battalion of French soldiers who are ill equipped for the battle ahead. When the battle proves to be a failure the leading general overseeing the attack decides to make an example of three randomly chosen men from the battalion. The men are to be tried under penalty of death for cowardice in the face of the enemy. With the film Paths of Glory we are given a look at what becomes of the common solider when he is being led by immoral superior officers only focused on there own personal gain. Peering into the emotions of men who have faced unbelievable circumstances and threw the efforts of one solider trying to save there lives. Paths of Glory in my opinion is one of Stanley Kubrick's best and most endearing works in his long list of excellent films. In showing us human fears on a personal level threw great story, wonderful camera work, and excellent acting Kubrick succeeds in making a spectacular anti-war film.",
