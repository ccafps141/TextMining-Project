On Mexico's Day Of The Dead festival, a convoluted series of events sees Miguel transported to the Land of the Dead, where he discovers that the dead disappear when no-one remembers them. He also discovers that unless he returns to the land of the living by dawn, he will join the dead. And there are problems ahead!",/

4,2 December 2017,pramsalim,10, I cried twice watching this.,"I have always been a fan of Pixar. They are really good at what they do. These guys set the bar for quality animated movies. Back then, animated movies were pretty much made for kids only. They were just your usual Sunday morning cartoons. Large eyeballs, goofy voice, exaggerated slapsticks. Disney had its classics like Bambi, Fox and The Hound, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. However, it felt more like fairy tales. Bedtime stories your parents give as they tuck you in. In this day and age, it wouldn't work that well. Then came Pixar with it's revolutionary debut, Toy Story. Funny, sweet, modern, relatable and plus, completely 3D animated, which marks the first time a feature film was completely 3D animated. And Pixar has been doing just this ever since.",i

Miguel loves music and must keep his love a secret from his family who has forbidden music of any kind since the days of his great great grandmother.

7,28 November 2021,jp_91,10, The magic of Mexico!,"""Coco"" is the best animated film from Pixar and the best animated film of the present time. The script full of Mexican traditions and customs is rich in story, which is deep and emotional. The animation is impressive capturing the magic of Mexico and día de muertos, with colorful cinematography and tremendous characters. The voice work of the Mexican and Mexican-American actors is impressive, each voice full of emotions and with a great talent for singing that excels in each musical theme. ""Coco"" is the best film based on a Latin American country, a masterpiece!",/
8,28 December 2019,Tweekums,10, Another great film from Pixar,"This Pixar animation is centred on Miguel a Mexican boy who dreams of becoming a musician. Unfortunately for him his family has banned all music because his great great grandfather had abandoned his great great grandmother to become a musician... they expect him to become a shoemaker like the rest of his family. On the Day of the Dead he plans to sneak off and take part in a music competition but his grandmother destroys his guitar. Needing a new instrument he breaks into the tomb of his hero, legendary musician Ernesto de la Cruz, to borrow his guitar. As soon as he plays a chord something strange happens... nobody alive can see him but he can interact with his dead relatives who can enter the world of the living that one day. He returns to the Land of the Dead with them. He learns that if he stays past the end of the night he will become one of the dead! His family could return him but add the condition that he must give up on music... he refuses believing that Ernesto is his great great grandfather so could return him without such a condition. Héctor offers to help in exchange for taking his picture back to the Land of the Living. In what follows Miguel learns more about his family and culture.",r
9,13 April 2018,classicsoncall,10," ""Music's the only thing that makes me happy.""","I'm not an animated movie fan per se, so this one caught me in just the right frame of mind or it was indeed brilliantly done. Probably the latter because I'd have no qualms about watching it again, as it was cleverly written, very colorful and had an unusually interesting story line. Not to mention that it had enough Espanol sprinkled in to make my four years of high school Spanish appropriately worthwhile. I also enjoyed some of the traditional folk concepts introduced by the story, like the Mexican 'Dia de Los Muertos', the annual Day of the Dead Celebration, along with it's fantastical sprit creatures called 'alebrijes'. One thing you'll have to do is pay attention at the beginning of the story to understand the relationship of young Miguel to his past and present family members; we go back in time all the way to his great-great grandfather, which turns out to be one of the twists in the story. At first I was upset that Ernesto de la Cruz turned out to be a villain, but the story handled that switch perfectly and helped inspire the entire Rivera Family to love music once again. The best concept for me however was in the explanation of how the spirits in the afterworld disappeared when there was no one left alive to think about them any more. Thoughtful families would do well to take that instruction to heart to keep alive the memories and traditions of their ancestors from the past.",w
10,3 May 2018,Vuraxis,9, Pixar has created a masterpiece of cinema,"I'm no critic, but Coco is close to movie perfection. It definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, no doubt, and is by far the best animated movie ever created. The visuals are stunning, the characters are fantastic, the twist is somewhat predictable but still great, and the story is so touching. This is the best film I have ever seen, over Shawshank, over The Godfather, over The Matrix; this film is a godlike creation from the very, very best of cinema. Do not be fooled by the haters who say it is a poor portrayal of a tradition; the tradition is likely far more beautiful in Coco than in real life. Fantastic, I am blown away.",4

Before I was afraid to hear and see and spirit, ghost related topics, those words in my impression is associated with terror, but let me after seeing this film has the different understanding to the dead, people become dead still have colorful life after death, have relatives, friends, there are joys and sorrows, is no longer so afraid of death. As long as the world remembers, it will still exist in this world, only when the world is completely forgotten, that is, when you no longer have anything to do with the world, will be turned into a golden powder, facing real death",8

19,9 May 2018,bradinhanson,9, Why I believe it deserves a 10,Pixar has come a long way. To them their creations have become a science into human emotion and I don't know any better company that has nearly perfected the craft. Soon they'll have 10's across the board from music to picture and from story to the characters. Never have I seen that more than in the movie WALL-E. This movie is up there. More than just its basic elements it dared to dive into a culture that very few in the world know about. It went above and beyond in research in getting those in Mexicos stamp of approval. It touches a deeper recess of the heart where the soul lies dormant and awakens it with hope and optimism. It takes the differences we often critique and judge upon another group only for Pixar to place a mirror right in front of us and stare at our own reflection. It takes the common elements so as to identify with the characters and stir a feeling of commonality. It's brilliant and ingenious. These things alone give it an 8. The 10 is because it was bold and dared to go places other won't. In this I found originality. Something you don't see often these days. Best part of all it unified. It takes ones thick skull (pun intended) and supplies human emotion as the medium to communicate the message so as to reach the heart. One may call that manipulation but due to its sincere true message and goodness I humbly give it a 10.,r

25,22 October 2017,brotheryour,10, Best Pixar Movie Yet!,"Yes, Pixar Animation Studios has done it again -- their latest release, Coco (2017), is not only a return to form, but also manages to be their best feature yet. From 1995 all the way up until 2010, Pixar knocked it out of the park with every release, save for Cars (2006) and maybe A Bug's Life (1998). However, after Cars 2 (2011), it seems every release of theirs has been bad or mediocre, except of course for 2015's extraordinary Inside Out (2015). Luckily, Coco (2017) manages to be the second great Pixar movie since Toy Story 3 (2010), and hopefully a return to form for good this time. All I will divulge about the plot is that it follows a boy named Miguel and his dog traveling into the Land of the Dead. From there, the story takes you to startling visual, entertainment, and emotional heights that no Pixar movie, no kids' movie, and very few ""adult"" movies have ever taken you. Yes, this is even more emotional than Up (2009) and Inside Out (2015) -- both of those films moved me to tears, but never hit me as hard as this one did. It touched something deep within my soul, and unlike most emotional films where my eyes will water a bit, in this one I began to openly weep. It was an emotional catharsis like I've never experienced before. Aside from the poignant elements, the film also manages to be enormously entertaining, with exhilarating sequences that reaches levels of fun Pixar hasn't reached since Monsters, Inc (2001) and The Incredibles (2004). They use the visually gorgeous Land of the Dead they have created to their full advantage, to provide a rollicking adventure that combines imagination and entertainment brilliantly. The other thing I should mention is the score, which is, by far, the best Pixar score I have ever had the pleasure of listening to -- yes, even better than Finding Nemo's (2003), Up's (2009), and Inside Out's (2015). I suppose that shouldn't come as a surprise, considering this is the most musical movie Pixar has ever created, but nevertheless was one of the many, many memorable aspects. In Conclusion, my favorite Pixar movies up until this point have been Toy Story (1995), Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), WALL-E (2008), and Up (2009), with Monsters, Inc. (2001), Ratatouille (2007), Toy Story 3 (2010), and Inside Out (2015) not far behind. I have been disappointed by their seemingly endless sequels this decade, and by the fact that even their originals (Brave (2012) and The Good Dinosaur (2015)) have been okay at best. Even Inside Out (2015), though I love it, is still better at delivering an important message to children than it is being its own story. But with Coco (2017), Pixar has nailed it. It brought me back to childhood nostalgia of watching Pixar classics like Finding Nemo (2003) and Toy Story (1995); the fun, the adventure, the laughs, and the tears. This is what a Pixar movie should be, this is what a kids' movie should me, this is what any movie should be, and it is truly one of my favorite movies of all time.",t

33,28 November 2017,hiraishinnojutsu,8, Disney did it again! A heartwarming and dazzling family movie about the importance of living in the hearts and minds of our loved ones,"It's not a secret that every time Disney's Pixar make people of all ages spend their holiday or weekend with their families on the theaters to watch their latest product, the movie must be full of lovable characters, funny scenes, memorable soundtracks, and tear- jerking scenes that would push a critic website like Rotten Tomatoes to score it above 90% or so. Just take a look at Toy Story 3 (99%), Up (98%), Inside Out (98%), and Wall-e (96%). As for this year, we have Coco. As I write this review, Coco already gained a score of 96% on the aforementioned website. Well, it turns out that critics (almost) never wrong when it comes to scoring. Coco helps viewers to remember that no one ever truly dies as long as the memories about them, be it good or bad, live inside the hearts and minds of their loved ones, that the real and true death comes when the records of the dead simply vanished and no one is left to keep them safe and sound inside their neuron system, a cruel fate that everyone on the planet share sooner or later. As terrifying as it is, we are left with the choice of how we are going to be remembered before we fade away into nothingness, is it by doing something remarkable? something evil? something amazing? embarrassing? or just something mediocre? You decide..... ",

A subtle yet charming and inspiring story; with a quality of animation worthy of an Academy Award (I wouldn't be surprised if it was one of the great winners of 2018); with an extremely powerful soundtrack; an excellent script; likable, well-developed and relatable characters; and extremely respectful of the cultural component in which the story is inspired. In short, one of the best landings of Pixar - perhaps repeating a bit its known formula, hence you can feel a ""back to basics"" in terms of the narrative, history and character development, but at the same time managing to stand out as a fresh and purposeful product that will undoubtedly give a lot to talk about.",

It concerns a boy who wants to play music against his family's wishes which would be because of an ancestor who abandoned his family for a career in such a profession. We think his ancestor was one person but turns out to be another...oh, just watch and be very touched especially when the song ""Remember Me"" is performed.

61,29 October 2017,linkogecko,9, The Cempasuchil Bridge,"""Coco"" is unquestionably a movie about bridging gaps. In the film, a literal bridge of marigold petals links the Worlds of the Living and the Dead for a night. In the real world, Pixar has tended a symbolic bridge with this film to link Mexicans, Chicanos (U.S.-based Mexicans and their descendants), U.S. nationals and the world via one of our most difficult shared human experiences. This isn't a movie spearheaded by Mexican artists to introduce the world to one of our beloved idiosyncrasies, like the inevitably comparable ""The Book of Life"" (a movie that I like but have far more issues with as a film fan than ""Coco"", regardless of nationality) but to simplify it as ""a culturally appropriative work by a non-Mexican"" would be to not only miss the point of the story told in it but to miss the point in its creation as well.",

64,24 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,9, Coco is a heartwarming tale that hosts an array of memorable characters on a beautiful Mexican canvas.,"Pixar rarely put a foot wrong, but lately their animations have become slightly uninspired (I'm looking at you 'Cars' franchise). Fortunately they are back, detailing an imaginative world with some extremely creative intricacies. A young boy who wishes to become a musician is forced to continue his family's legacy. Rebelliously he ignores his family's wishes and steals a guitar, to which he suddenly becomes cursed and now resides in the afterlife. This is probably as adventurous a film can be for children in regards to portraying death. Highlighting the importance of remembering loved ones and embracing your family, it's an extremely tender story that rather touched my heart. Trust Pixar to make me emotionally vulnerable. On top of this it's packed full of Mexican culture, in particular the Dia De Los Muertos (""Day of the Dead"" between you and me) event that is brimming with hearty family values. Miguel, our protagonist, starts off as a stubborn rebel but slowly succumbs to the realisation that others are just as important. Being surrounded by his deceased relatives develops him as a character, to which we emotionally become invested in him and the story itself. A few twists and turns to keep all viewers engaged. Absolutely gorgeous animation, especially the afterlife world which is populated with vibrant spirit animals and colourful architecture. An all Mexican cast is much appreciated and definitely enhances the authenticity of this production, the voice acting and musical numbers were both executed perfectly. ""Remember Me"" was a beautiful song, its lyrics pulled me in. The humour doesn't always hit, and that really is my only flaw. The screenplay just tried too hard. Having said that, this is one of Pixar's better animations in recent years and continues their powerful hold of the genre. That ending though...urgh, I nearly teared up.",

It's also the rare movie by this studio to be an animated musical, of a sort, and it is ingrained in the DNA of the thing- I thought it would be about something as simple (and still important) as music.

73,4 December 2017,ironhorse_iv,9," Gracias Pixar! You did a good job, once again! Your brush with death, made for one vibrant entertaining movie!","'Coco' is an affecting, coming of age story of a young boy, Miguel Rivera (voiced by Anthony Gonzalez), whom desire to become a musician despite his family's wishes. Hoping to win, the local talent show, he steals a guitar off a dead man, and find himself accidentally transported to the land of the dead, where he must seeks the help of his instrumentalist great, great grandfather to return him to his family among the living. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while, it seems like similar film, 20th Century Fox, 2014's computer animation film 'the Book of Life' has shown everything special about the Mexican holiday of Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) to families, around the world. In contrast, Pixar & Disney Studios, with their own unique visuals style, not only show the holiday, mostly culturally sensitive right with their use colorful, beautifully computer animated of holiday decorations, but also the history of Mexican art culture, accuracy as well. We see that, with their homage to real life deceased Mexican celebrities, including Frida Kahlo, Mario Moreno, El Santo, Jorge Negrete, & Pedro Infante, through muralism art, music, lucha libre mask & fictional cameos. Nevertheless, not all the visuals from 'Coco' work. Some of the Easter Eggs, Pixar used, was a bit jarring. Although, it was pretty cool to see cameos items from other Pixar films. It just doesn't work with the world, Lee Unkrich & his crew, are trying to build. It was also a bit jolting to see Alebrije in the afterlife; when in truth, both really have barely anything to do with each other. Still, like the Pixar cameos; seeing the xoloitzcuintli, become one in the end is only a small nitpick. After all, it was also a nice smart nod to the famous author of 'The Divine Comedy', even if the book technically, not from Mexican culture. As for the writing, I thought, 'Coco' told a more focus and accuracy version of life & death with unique twist and turns, a little better than the other movie, even if bits of 'Coco's foreshadowing is a little shallow & predictable. While, the afterlife sequences still contains some potentially disturbing imagery, most kids will probably get used to all, quickly. However, a few others tension might be, a little rough such as the out of nowhere, murder subplot. It's been days, I'm still shock, on how the villain manage not being caught for his crimes for so long, even after he admits to poisoning on film. Nor do I understand, why he would do that, in story. Does, he have that huge of an ego!? Also, is it just me, or does it seem odd, that, the character can't write music, but he's somehow able to write scripts. It's bizarre; just like how dead people have jobs in the afterlife, even, when there is no such thing as money. Nevertheless, while both movies has huge gaps of logic. These two parallel works couldn't be more different with the direction. After all, Día de los Muertos was never, truly about one man stuck between the battles between two supernatural beings for the rights to own the dead. It was, about the rights of the dead to visit, their love ones; which 'Coco' really did capitalize on, better. Because of this, I found 'Coco' to be a little more emotional well rounded for the viewers than the far out there, epic fantasy 'Book of Life' ever could be. Despite being a little clichés & over familiar; powerful themes of perseverance, teamwork, and appreciate your their family, while following your dreams will make audience love this movie, even a little more. Trust me, when I say this, there were a lot of moments, throughout 'Coco', where the audience will indeed shed a tear or two. It will be especially moving for anyone who's had to separate from their family, whether because of death or another reasons. There is also smart commentary on the immigration complications that it's happening, in today's world. Even if we're not from that culture, deep inside us, we can all relate to the story of their struggles. This rare musical story from Pixars really get you to felt something, regardless. While, the screen writing was mostly alright; the songs in the film, such as ""Remember Me,"" an original song from Robert and Kristen Lopez and other songs written and produced by a team of Mexican songwriters and consultants, including award winning composer Michael Giacchino score, will make you cry, cheer and laugh with its five different musical versions (Ranchero, Lullaby, Reminiscing, Power Ballard, and Pop Version). Not only that, but ""Coco"" original soundtrack felt more of authentic with its Latin Mariachi sounding songs, than the other movie's generic bubble gum homage covers of popular US billboard track music. Because of that, I felt that 'Coco's music will be a little more memorable, over time. Another thing that help this movie separate itself from the other movie is that all the voice actors were, in fact, Latinos. It's nice to see that; since, providing Latin American's cultures through speech is really hard to pull, if you're not from there. All of the voice performers in 'Coco' did a great job, singing and acting, both in Spanish & English. However, the Spanish version does have some problems. One is the title. Not only does 'Coco' mean supernatural connections, but sadly, it's also means, the name, the native people of Mexico gave to smallpox. Nevertheless, that wasn't the only problem with Disney & Latin American relationship. Trademarking 'Dia de los Muertos' for merchandising applications, also cause controversial. Other marketing blunder, Disney did, was attached this film with badly receive, critical failure 2017's short film, 'Olaf's Frozen Adventure'. Replaying 'Dante's lunch' (2017) would mesh better. Despite that, overall: I have to say, heavily idealistic, emotional, and touching. 'Coco' is a must watch. Viva Mexico!",

I quite enjoyed this emotional animation movie, which really does have something for everyone but I must admit, I didn't really find it that funny. I know that it wasn't supposed to be that amusing but I missed the usual Pixar humour, which I have grown to love over the years. Don't get me wrong, the movie is certainly entertaining and the animation is truly remarkable but it's not the type of film that you can watch time and time again, like the earlier Pixar movies. With that aside, the attention to detail was great and the storyline was well written but I was still expecting more from this reputable company. Anyway, the movie is about a little boy, Miguel, who has a secret love of music, even though his family has banned it from there home. When he sees that there is going to be a local music competition, he escapes from home to show off his talents, but he is caught by another family member, who destroys his guitar. Failing to find another guitar to enter the competition, he decides to steal the guitar from the famous Ernesto de la Cruz mausoleum, who turns out to be his great-great-grandfather. Whilst stealing the guitar, Miguel becomes invisible to everyone in the village plaza, and he enters the mysterious world of the Land of the Dead, were he meets his skeletal dead relatives. Miguel soon realises that he is cursed for trying to steal the guitar, and he can only return to the Land of the Living, if he is blessed by one of his relatives before sunrise. One of his relatives, Imelda, offers to give him a blessing but on the condition that he abandons his musical pursuits, which Miguel refuses and attempts to seek Ernesto's blessings instead. Miguel then escapes from his family, to seek his great-great-grandfather but he's unable to get far because of his human looks. He then gets the help from Hector, who needs Miguels help to get his picture back to his daughter, so she doesn't forget him, so they go on there mysterious journey to find Ernesto, before Hector disappears, and Miguel gets banished to the Land of the Dead. It's quite an unusual but original storyline, which took 6 years to bring to the big screen, due to the importance of getting the authenticity of the project completely correct, and I'm sure that the animation took ages to perfect as well. I appreciate the work behind the scenes, that it takes to make a Pixar movie but I personally think that they have lost there touch since they have gone to Disney. That's not to say that this movie wasn't a great watch but there is too much competition out there at the moment. With movies like Ferdinand to compete with, Pixar need to up there game to claim back the top spot that they have owned for many years. Anyway, this movie is definitely worth a watch, and I'm sure that people will shed a tear, and jump for joy whilst watching it but I personally was hoping for more in the humour department. Enjoyable!",

This story is also very unique because it has a whole new interesting world to explore and I have not seen anything like this world before. Last off the villain is kinda weak but they don't really focus on them instead they focus on the journey which is a good thing. So in the end this is a great movie and I recommend it to anyone.,

The movie has some of the most impressive animation that I've seen.",

From the cast to the look (astoundingly beautiful in the Land of the Dead), to the music and songs. From beginning to end it was simply a breathtaking, totally absorbing, beautiful movie. Pixar should suck up a few more Oscars on this one. The one thing I could have really done without was the lame Olaf from Frozen short. Boring and uninspired, I'd rather have seen a few more trailers. But Coco is a gem in the crown that is Pixar.",
125,7 February 2018,TheOny13,10, El mejor from Pixar! (No spoilers),Coco is a new animated movie created by Lee Unkrich and tells the story of Miguel and how he wants to become a great musician just like his great-great-grandfather.

Mexican folklore and Dia de la Muerta are complex ideology but Coco does a beautiful job of explaining them and will probably convince people to either celebrate Dia de la Muerta or at the very least remind the viewer to remember loved ones who've passed and/or appreciate loved ones more while they're here with us.
Not spoiler but I will say - have a tissue handy. While many animated movies are hilarious and sweet. This one is funny, sweet, and interesting. Also intelligent. And will make you cry. Unless I'm just a big blubbering baby. Enjoy.",

It is an easy film in the sense that the themes of the film are clearly exposed in dialogues, which a priori would be bad, but when thinking about children it is understood. These themes, however, are extremely transcendental and are carried with great care and affection. These topics are for adults because they are in the background.",

Directors Adrian Molina and Lee Unkrich's ""Coco"" surprise with their story surrounding The Day of the Dead – Dia de Los Muertos. Vibrant images and colors amaze with texture and wonder. ""Coco""'s state-of-the art CGI visuals alone astound. Yet, its big heart lies in the story. Molina and Matthew Aldrich's screenplay resonates forgiveness and remembrance.

For some inexplicable reason, I har it at 11 in my Pixar ranking but that was way too harsh. It's now in 6th place and there's a reason. It's beautiful every way. I'm not Mexican in any way but it was amazing having a Mexican setting and delving into Mexican culture and the holiday of Día de los muertos. It's so interesting and obviously the animation is gorgeous, especially the Land of the Dead, a beautiful and creative world with so much atmopshere and life and that's an amazing thing about Coco. It's so full of atmosphere and life. I honestly really just want to visit The Land of the Dead as it looks to be such a fun place. The creators clearly put so much passion. But, also, this movie is so sad with the heartbreaking backstory of Héctor and his relationship with Coco. The two sequences of Remember Me are without a doubt some of Pixars' best. They break my heart. Every other character is great as well especially Miguel, who goes through such a compelling arc about family and Mama Imedla, a character with understandable motivations and Ernesto is a pretty great twist villain. Honestly, I think he's my most hated Pixar villain. I will never forgive him for what he did to Héctor and this movie has a beautiful message about family and who says Pixar can't make songs. Every song is phenomneal from Un poco loco to Remember Me to The World Es Mi Familia and Ay De Mi Llorona.",

This is their finest work since game-changer Inside Out in 2015, again tackling complex themes most studios would shy away from exposing their young audience to, and doing so with a technical flourish and completely free from the white-washing so common in American films dealing with a culture and folklore from overseas.

148,13 March 2018,blrnani,6, Don't know why this is so highly rated,"Don't get me wrong, it's fun and ticks a lot of boxes - indeed the whole endeavour seems to have been planned with that in mind.
I love cartoons, or animated features, as they are weightily called nowadays, and my earliest cinematic memories are of Peter Pan, Dumbo and Bambi - films that I treasure to this day. And people are doing fantastic things with the medium now, so The Incredibles, Monsters and WALL.E have joined the classics among my favourites.
I like that the film addresses an interesting theme and a culture, but I enjoyed Book Of Life more, although both are refreshing and bring so much colour and liveliness to the screen. 
However, there are a great many animations that I rate more highly, not to mention other films in other areas. So I think 6 is about right for this one. I was enchanted by Inside Out, but only gave it an 8 (the same as classics such as Snow White and Fantasia), since there are aspects of it that are aimed at a younger audience.",

The animation - as expected from Pixar - is incredible. So colorful and I love the explanation by the three Pixar contributors is so good - will make the average person who does not understand animation - appreciate it and all the work that goes into it.
And then there is Remember Me - truly deserves to be nominated for an Oscar. For once there is a song that I will remember too. A fun film beautifully done.",

Pixar's COCO will not only entice your kids to welcome their Mexican friends, but will persuade many if not most tykes to want to BECOME Mexican themselves! COCO relates a Parable about Mexico's version of Elvis--Ernesto--who murders Hector, the REAL creative talent behind this pair of musicians' Wealth and Fame. As always, The Truth eventually struggles out. In Real Life America--especially at this time of year--the closest parallel to COCO is Anglophile Fat Cat Family Tory Scion Wolf-in-Preacher's-Clothing C. Clement Moore when he seized the credit, fame, and royalty wealth (of course) from the REAL ""Night Before Christmas"" story-telling poet, Captain Henry Livingston, Jr., a Revolutionary War Hero and actual True Blue Loyal Patriotic Normal Average 99 Per Center Progressive Union Label Man of the People. (The modest Hank was not one for tooting his own horn, leaving an opening for the gold-digging plagiarist Clem to brazenly steal authorship--NINE YEARS AFTER HANK DIED--of a lucrative rhyme published anonymously many years earlier; as Clem sank into dementia, he also claimed credit for having written ""Roses are red"" and several books of the Holy Bible, too.) Please bring your tykes to COCO so that they can learn to distrust Big Business Bozos like the Disney Suits, and understand that True Art pretty much always comes from We ""Little People"" like Hector; NOT from the grasping clutches of the Fat Cat Class, like Ernesto and C.

Music is forbidden in the family. The family wanted Miguel to stay out of music and become a good shoemaker.

The story was a match made in Pixar heaven due to its heart wrenching and heartwarming moments. Though this story seemed a bit morbid at times, you can really tell Pixar catered this movie to adults as well as kids. The visual effects were probably my favorite in any Pixar film thus far. The amount of detail on screen at any given time was beyond belief. Also, the character development was extraordinary. Having an extensive look at each character's background not only helped you fall in love with the characters, but it was also used as a unique storytelling device. The music in this movie was great too as it paid homage to the traditional mariachi style still practiced in Mexico today. The movie even featured some songs with lyrics entirely in Spanish. Overall, I would say this movie captured the Mexican heritage to a T.

Not to mention one of the most grisly Disney deaths I can think of (Others to me would be Bugs Life and Tarzan). That scene of the jet getting blown up always gets me emotionally. It's super tense and you understand both Helen and Violet's viewpoint of asking Violet to put a force-field around the plane. You're pulling for Violet and yet feel the frustration and fear of Helen. It's edited so well. Ug! I'm gushing. It's also refreshing to see a full family in a family movie. Disney has a lot of broken/single-parents and I get it. It saves money to not have siblings or two parents. it's less complicated. it makes kids like that feel better. But it's so nice to see a movie about family and about what they can accomplish together and show what a family can be. It's really encouraging. One of Pixar's best. Oh, and Edna is wonderful. duh",
186,4 June 2018,Jirorian,10, Divine,"Pixar delves deeper into the realm of difficult and hard to visually conceptualise subject areas with its family-friendly film about death, 'Coco', while setting the story in Mexico with the main character, a young boy striving to become a musician named Miguel, classifying as a minority under Trump's America. The Land of the Dead, the setting for a large portion of the film, is an interpretation of traditional Mexican beliefs that are realised in the film alongside a deliberate avoidance of any religious connotations or messages. The dog - a Xoloitzcuintli, native animals to Mesoamerica historically believed to guide dead souls to the underworld - is named Dante in reference to the Italian poet Dante Alighieri, whom travelled through the underworld and returned in his epic, 'The Divine Comedy', ultimately to the same objective as Miguel in informing the living of the greater truth that they have learnt in their travels. As much as Dante's Divine Comedy is structured around the religious values that shaped medieval understandings of the world, 'Coco' is about family, and its messages are equally about the bringing about of a more socially unified world. Especially in the current climate where social division has been prevailing more than ever in recent times, commonly reflected through the sentiment pervading border control policies, 'Coco' provides a vision of all the good that perhaps we have been forgetting, and a landscape where border control is not about division but about bringing families together.",

Soon they'll have 10's across the board from music to picture and from story to the characters. Never have I seen that more than in the movie WALL-E. This movie is up there. More than just its basic elements it dared to dive into a culture that very few in the world know about. It went above and beyond in research in getting those in Mexicos stamp of approval. It touches a deeper recess of the heart where the soul lies dormant and awakens it with hope and optimism. It takes the differences we often critique and judge upon another group only for Pixar to place a mirror right in front of us and stare at our own reflection. It takes the common elements so as to identify with the characters and stir a feeling of commonality. It's brilliant and ingenious. These things alone give it an 8. The 10 is because it was bold and dared to go places other won't. In this I found originality. Something you don't see often these days. Best part of all it unified. It takes ones thick skull (pun intended) and supplies human emotion as the medium to communicate the message so as to reach the heart. One may call that manipulation but due to its sincere true message and goodness I humbly give it a 8.,

And one day watching it I thought if it is impossible to say what is better, for example, ""Coco"" or ""Ratatouille"" maybe I can try to figure out what is the best episode in animation? That's also very difficult question but on my opinion the episode when Imelda accidentally is forced to do forbidden is told so artfully and keeps so many senses, beauty and elevates the story on the ""Olympus"" of storytelling. ""La Llorona"" is the most powerful thing I have ever heard. It is not ""the song for the song sake"" like in Disney. ""La llorona"" is the quintessence of the woman's tragedy. If Gods should tell us the example of a deftly storytelling, they definitely could tell the story of Imelda, how and why she sings with her husband again after decades of separation.",

And while there are ghosts, skeletons, and alebrijes, the movie almost captures Mexican culture perfectly through the mission of Miguel and his plight to make it back to his family from the spirit world during Dia de los Muertos. Not only is the storytelling magical, but the music gives another medium to help the film flow but also to help infuse it with Mexican culture and sound. As a geography major it also impressed me how the creators made a fake Mexican town for Miguel and his family out of real places in Mexico. It is true that most of Miguel's time is spent adventuring in the Land of the Dead trying to find Ernesto or running from his deceased relatives but the writers took such care in detailing the first twenty minutes in the Land of the Living.",

200,3 March 2018,y_m-00834,6," A very mediocre, yet overrated film.","Coco is an animated film, centered on Mexican culture and Latino music, and mostly celebrated in Mexico, which is no big surprise. I liked the message (or maybe messages) it suggests to a child audience and also the whole idea of representing the world of the dead. However, as with most Disney films, everything gets excessively sentimental and ""Disneyfied"" here, not offering too much to the adult audience and making it simply a children's film. The film uses many (potentially) powerful assets to build up a great piece, but sadly it fails in most departments. For instance, we see the dead people made out of moving bones and adjustable skeletons, but very few ""funny"" gags are developed out of this rich context. Any reasons why? Because film makers were seemingly more fascinated by the overall looks and visual elements of the film, rather than being creative and genuine. The film is about music, but you can't really find a decent score throughout the whole film and the beats are not catchy enough to stay with you afterwards. Miguel enters the land of the dead right after he steals a guitar, but no further explanations are given about how and why did this journey happen to this particular boy? I count that as a plot hole. One implicit lesson embedded into this film, which is a big plus also, is about recognizing the unknown and uncredited artists that are actually the real backbones of the industry, and give credit to them, where credit is due. But surprisingly, the villain of the film, Ernesto de la cruz, who is a legendary singer-songwriter and also a big liar, is an exact replica of Queen's Freddie Mercury, with his shaded eyes, striking cheekbones and that iconic suit. Actually the reference couldn't get more blatant right after he threw Miguel off the cliff and said: ""The Show Must Go On!"" What a coincidence? And why do you have to reference a real world legend as a deceiver? All in all, despite all its good moments, Coco didn't meet my overall expectations.",

It's nowhere even near the same level as Toy Story 3, Inside Out, Up and WALLE. It went on for too long, some scenes dragged and weren't that entertaining. The first half especially was extremely dull, I literally just didn't know why I was watching the film. But the day of the dead scenes were kinda entertaining and quite a bit of fun. That was really when the film started to pick itself up a bit. The animation is spectacular and I'm glad that Pixar satisfied me with their stunning visuals, like they always do. The characters are good-fun and are people you can definitely relate to. Miguel is a great lead and when he's stuck with these skeleton-like people (I don't know what to call them, sorry!), it really is a lot of fun and entertaining. Although I didn't even enjoy Coco that much, I'm pretty sure you will, I'm pretty sure you'd like to watch it.I enjoyed this one less then Cars 3 but give it a watch, and if you don't want to, don't. The first 40-50 minutes you may not be entertained or satisfied like I was, but you will be surprised and amazed and the second half.

(I should note that parts of it are in fact off for both the holiday and how it papers over ethnic divisions in Mexican society) It is after all American capital turning another culture into a commodity. This raises a whole slew of issues that the film avoids by being self-aware. The film defuses the frayed aspects of its existence by the central twist of the story; who the song Remember Me was actually written for and to what end the antagonist put said song to use. . It is one those times that Disney gets to have its cake and eat it too. I think it works more or less well in context.

The plot is about Miguel who lives with a family of shoemakers, but Miguel strugles more of being a guitarr player than being a shoemaker, so he runs away one day and tries to get a guitarr from his idle, Ernesto De La Cruice, but ends up getting sent to the world of the dead, now he must find Ernesto in order to back home safely.
Now for the pros and the cons: The pros are: The story is pretty emotional, the way the world of the dead is crafed is creative, is emotional, the animation is top notch, the jokes were funny, it has an amazing plot twist that can get dark, and of course, the songs are downright catchy.
The only con I have with the movie is because it´s pretty cliché, I mean, not only does this have a few similarities to the book of life, but this also rips off movies like Happy Feet, which is a character wanting to be someone that he wants to be rather than being what the others around him are, and other Disney and Pixar movies like Aristocats and Finding Nemo, which is about the main character getting far away from home, he comes across diferent characters and must find his way back home.
Overall, while being a cliché movie, Coco is a great movie, if you have enough bucks to try and rent or watch this movie, trust me, you won´t be dissapointed.",

216,5 January 2018,Horst_In_Translation,8," Pixar (and Disney)'s take on music, family and mortality","""Coco"" is the newest collaboration by Disney and Pixar and one of the most talked about animated films of 2017, probably an Oscar frontrunner right now. The man in the center of its production is Lee Unkrich, an Oscar winner for Toy Story 3 already. But in this 105-minute film here, we follow a boy and his passion for music that leads him down to the land of the dead even. The general plot idea of the whole family hating music because of what happened generations ago was maybe my only problem with the film. It does not feel too realistic. But everything else is fine. Music maybe could have been a bit better, but I watched the German dub, so maybe it is better in the English (with a bit of Spanish) original. I personally also felt that the film is always really more about the characters next to the boy than about the boy himself despite his deep-rooted connection with them. The dog, the fella with the hat and of course the fact that a child is in the center of it all (even if not the title character) makes it a good watch for kids too, but as a whole I believe, it is more of a film for grown-ups given the subject of death and several serious references. Early on, I struggled a bit with the fading away reference, basically a second death, but the way they included it then afterward was handled pretty nicely.",

238,27 November 2017,Animated_Antic,10," A funny, emotional and overall beautiful movie.","Here's a funny story. Back in July, I remember channel surfing when I came across an ad for the awful ""Emoji Movie"". In the commercial, Sony described the film as and I quote, ""the perfect family movie of the year"" even though not a single review had been released yet. It was one of the biggest lies I have seen so far this year. The reason why is not only because ""The Emoji Movie"" was appalling like I expected, but because ""Coco"" was actually the perfect family movie of the year. After having sat through so many disappointing as well uncreative animated movies this years, ""Coco"" came along and made up for everything. It's clear that the people of Pixar haven't lost their magic touch they had in the past because this movie is without a doubt, the year's best animated movie. This film has everything that I expect to see in an animated movie including a emotional and creative story, rich and beautiful animation, as well as funny and memorable characters with a nice touch of music. I'll now explain why you must see this movie.",

240,1 December 2017,matthewssilverhammer,7, Here's a Shocker: Pixar Made a Good Movie!,"Dia de Muertos, or ""Day of the Dead"", is a Mexican holiday in which families gather to commemorate and pray for their ancestors, with comfort food and exuberant decorations, all to help the deceased on their spiritual journeys. It's a stunningly beautiful and sweet celebration that could easily fit into most any cultural tradition, so why isn't it more widely recognized? Well, Pixar is doing their part with Coco. A studio that's never afraid to explore sadness and death with levity and heart, they've given us (in essentially their first musical) a film as vibrantly colorful and moving as the holiday it's informed by. Coco's story is pretty basic: kid rebels from hard-nosed family, makes friends with other outcasts, discovers his true calling, gets into some trouble, and tries to reconcile his tradition with his desire. Think Ratatouille, with music instead of food, and people instead of rats. It falls into some unnecessary story clichés and questionable character decisions, but it's never overwhelming. The brightness in the smaller things is incredible. The preciseness of the music, the connection to characters' plights, the energetic scenes and scenery, the jaw-dropping and unique animation; it's all festively enveloping. And beneath the juxtaposition of the unremarkable story and near-perfect details is Pixar's virtually unblemished record of deep emotions. The colors of Coco's world may draw in our sight; however, its characters' arcs, its thoughts on the importance of extended families, and its unapologetic desire to explore the inevitable and inherent sadness of aging and death, with plenty of entertainment along the way, make it another Pixar movie families should be celebrating.",

A lot of people thought this was going to be a fancier copy of ""The Book of Life"", but that's not at all the case. This one has a much more fleshed out story, with characters that the viewer grows to love and beautifully done animation. The movie starts off in a typical fashion, with the main character wanting to do something the family doesn't want him to, but the story gets interesting when Miguel believes he is related to Ernesto De la Cruz. Now you probably think you have this part of the plot figured out from what you've seen in the trailers, but Pixar pulls a ""Toy Story 3"" and ""Monsters Inc."" on us and surprise us. The meaning behind the title of the film becomes clear towards the end of the movie and it will pull at your feels. As a Latina American, I promise my fellow Latin American viewers they will not be disappointed. Pixar really did their research and present Mexican culture in a beautiful way. They even have animated Golden age Mexican actors and actresses in ""the other side"" like Pedro Infante, Jorge Negrete, and I think one of them is supposed to be Maria Felix. The family is depicted in a way that will be familiar to all Latinos watching. The animation both on the living and dead worlds is beautiful. I highly recommend this one. ""The Book of Life"" is cute, but ""Coco"" is a masterpiece. Thank you so much pixar.",

261,20 December 2017,2001ASOfan,2, If the filmmakers were sincere it truly didn't feel that way for me,"Please be warned my review must contain a major spoiler, as the main reason I was so saddened by ""Coco,"" when I went to the theater hoping for joyous laughs and a truly touching (and musical) celebration of Día de los Muertos (the impression I got from trailers, clips, and reviews I'd read prior to my seeing the film) is a critical plot point. Instead of joy, laughter, and earned tears I felt the filmmakers were far too calculated in their usage of an elderly woman's dementia and her slow decline toward death, so the supposedly ""uplifting"" ending instead came off as cruel and even heartless in manipulating the audience to tears (and likely tapping into very sad memories of relatives and friends who have passed from dementia and Alzheimer's). I also found the first third of the film almost completely unengaging, which truly surprised me, as Pixar is usually so careful with story and characters. This felt like a film that was coldly calculated to drain tear ducts rather than earning those tears from joyous creation and real caring for the characters onscreen. I hope I'm wrong about the filmmakers' intentions, but I came out of the theater thoroughly depressed and feeling, well, horribly manipulated. Dementia and Alzheimer's are incredibly cruel diseases, and their reality is very different than how it is portrayed at the end of ""Coco."" Either the filmmakers and scriptwriters have never actually closely experienced someone they loved being taken by these diseases or they are as heartless as it comes in using the gravity of these diseases as an easy way to make audiences cry. To those who loved the film and felt it earned its emotion: Of course I hope we will see our relatives and friends who have been diminished by memory diseases fully restored in the afterlife, but here it struck me as a cheap, quick, and easy shortcut trick of manipulation: The ""triumph"" of the final afterlife scene was either unintentionally cruel or coldly cruel, depending on the filmmakers' personal reasons for including same in the film. Be warned that if you have closely watched a loved one deteriorate and struggle with the fear and horror of losing their memory and faculties you, too, may find yourself angry at film's end, instead of joyous and uplifted. The only reason I gave this film two stars is that the animation is undeniably beautiful, and some of the songs tuneful and engaging--but that was it for me for any bit of enjoyment of the film.",

Basically in Santa Cecilia, Mexico, Imelda Rivera (Alanna Ubach) was the wife of a musician, her husband left her and their daughter, Coco, to pursue a career in music, following this Imelda banned music in the family and opened a family shoemaking business. In the present, her great-grandson Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) lives with the now elderly Coco (Ana Ofelia Murguía) and his family, he has a secret passion for music, wanting to be a star like the famous actor and singer Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt). One day, Miguel accidentally damages a photo of Imelda at the centre of the family ofrenda (a collection of family photos on a ritual altar) and removes it, he discovers that the husband, whose husband has his face torn off, is holding Ernesto's famous guitar. Miguel concludes that he is Ernesto's descendant, and he has much more passion to enter a talent show for the Day of the Day celebrations, but his grandmother Elena objects, she angrily destroying Miguel's guitar. In desperation to find a guitar and enter the talent show, Miguel sneaks into Ernesto's mausoleum, which holds the great star's guitar, after strumming the instrument, a magic gust of wind and light transforms him. Miguel finds he has become invisible to everyone in the village, and he can walk through the people and objects, but he can be seen by Xoloitzcuintli dog Dante, and his dead relatives, who appear as skeletons, they are on holiday, visiting from the Land of the Dead. The ancestors take Miguel with them to the Land of the Dead, they realise that Imelda cannot visit as Miguel has removed her photo from the ofrenda, and Miguel is cursed for stealing from the dead. Miguel must return to the Land of the Living before sunrise, or he will become one of the dead, to do so he needs a blessing from a member of his family using an Aztec marigold petal and undo the curse. Imelda offers her blessing, but on condition that he must abandon his musical pursuits, Miguel ignores this, he again strums the stolen guitar, and immediately returns to the Land of the Dead. He runs away from his dead relatives, knowing they will only let him return to the Land of the Living if he stops playing music, so Miguel attempts to find Ernesto, his presumed great-grandfather, to get his blessing. Miguel encounters Héctor (Amores Perros star Gael García Bernal), a down-on-his-luck skeleton who once played with Ernesto, he offers to help Miguel find him, in return for Miguel taking his photo back to the Land of the Living se he can visit his daughter before she forgets him, and he disappears forever. Héctor disguises Miguel to appear as a skeleton, they formulate a plan for Miguel to play in a talent show, the winner will play audience to Ernesto at his mansion, he does rouse the crowd with his performance, but Héctor becomes convinced to return Miguel to his relatives. Miguel escapes and infiltrates Ernesto's mansion, with the help of the act that won the talent show, Miguel finds a way to get close to Ernesto, when he realises he may be his great-grandson, Ernesto is pleased to introduce welcome him as his descendant. Miguel learns about a friendship between Ernesto and Héctor that deteriorated before Héctor's death, Héctor arrives and confronts them, imploring him to take his photo. Miguel realises through their discussion that Héctor was poisoned by Ernesto, who stole the songs he had written, passing them off as his own to become famous, Ernesto steals Héctor's photo and has him and Miguel thrown into a cenote pit. Trapped and talking to each other, Miguel realises that Héctor is his actual great-great-grandfather and that Coco is Héctor's daughter, she is only living person who still remembers him, but her dementia is causing her memory of him to disappear. With the help of Dante, who turns into an alebrije (a brightly coloured mythical creature), the dead Rivera find and rescue them, Miguel reveals that Héctor's murder was the result of him wanting to return home to his family, Ernesto killed him for halting their success, Imelda and Héctor reconcile.

This is an animated Pixar/Disney movie about the Mexican Day of the Dead, aka:Dia de los Muertos. They even use Mexican mariachi style music in the credits-beginning & end-when they show the Disney logo with the fireworks going off. The theater I was at was also showing it in both English & Spanish versions. Anyway, Anthony plays a little 10- 12 year old boy that loves music, both playing guitar and singing, just like his idol, Benjamin. But his whole family does not allow music in the house-because of a great great grandfather that was a traveling musician and left his family to pursue his career-and forbids Anthony to participate in any form. FYI: The title character of Coco, is the daughter of the a fore mentioned traveling musician, who is now Anthony's great grandmother. Anthony decides to borrow the guitar of Benjamin from his tomb-who died in an accident while he was on stage-but stealing from the dead sends Anthony to the land of the dead, where he meets Gael, an old friend of Benjamin, who promises to help Anthony find Benjamin in the afterlife. Edward is a character called Chicharron. The animation is really amazing, especially when they show the culture and traditions of the holiday. Some, I knew about-like the photos and mementos of the departed being displayed in little shrines-but others, I was unfamiliar with-like the animal spirit guides in the afterlife. There is a 21 minute short film called 'Olaf's Frozen Adventure' that is shown before the movie-I'm sure that it is just an early promotion for the next Frozen movie, but it was enjoyable-there are a couple of new songs in it. It's rated ""PG"" for thematic elements and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes. Although it is definitely aimed at a Hispanic audience, you don't have to be Hispanic to enjoy it-I did.

You empathise entirely with the musical Miguel at almost every moment, from finding the obtuse stubbornness of his family incredibly frustrating to coming to terms with the sacrifices he must make in order to stay with them, and even the various twists and turns are pretty original (also quite risky) even if I did cotton onto them far before they were actually revealed.

Meanwhile Miguel's granny is suffering from dementia and doesn't remember much and since its the land of the dead he steals a guitar and ends up going to see the land of the dead where he meets his family again and meets another skeleton named Hector who can't be remembered as his photo went missing and Miguel asks Hector to track down Emerla De LA Cruz who is Miguel's grandfather but is De LA Cruz really Miguel's grandfather? And will Miguel pursue his dreams as a musician and reunite with the living? Overall when I first saw the trailer for this I thought it was going to be a rip off of The Book Of Life which was also about the land of the dead.....but surprisingly it wasn't.

It's a visual, audible and emotional delight, enlivened with loud splashes of color and texture, and accompanied by a constantly upbeat musical vitality. There's no escaping the visual fabric of this film, immersive and jaw-dropping, as it constantly one-ups itself right alongside the developing plot. Particularly stunning is our crossing into the land of the dead, a monumental city of stacked shanties that shimmers and glistens and pulses as its residents decorate and celebrate their annual recognition. The story is simple but effective, perhaps a touch on the predictable side... but so are many animated classics, and sometimes there's something to be said for following through on a promise. Coco wears its heart on its sleeve, with a permeating, spirited warmth that's impossible to ignore, while also touching on tricky, lingering feelings of betrayal and repression. Dazzling and optimistic, with a subject that's, surprisingly, never been explored with such playful reverence in a major family film.

We follow Miguel, a young boy who aspires to be something that his family is against.
This movie was directed by Lee Unkrich and is a original movie presented by Disney and developed by Pixar, this means that you can expect great animation, music and at least decent writing. Lee Unkrich has co-directed a lot of Pixar classics like Finding Nemo (2003) and Monsters, Inc (2001), neither of them perfected but deservedly have the pronoun of classics. Other than being co-director, he also directed Toy Story 3 (2010), which in my opinion is a bit underwhelming, I would never call it a bad movie, because it has the same production quality as the other Toy Story movies, but I believe it has a lot of problems in its script and story, not gonna delve to deep about, just have in mind that I didn't love it, and would consider it a decent movie, not good.
Coco follows a lot of plot lines and ideas from other movies, but I wouldn't consider it a down for this movie in terms of quality, just makes it less original and more of a retread of another movies like The Book of Life (2014). Unfortunately this isn't the big problem of Coco.
The big problem of Coco it's mediocrity when it comes to the script and the finality of the ideas, not only it is incredibly obvious where the story goes, it also does unnecessary plot twists that are obvious and lack of sense, which I won't spoil for obvious reasons, and because of this the emotional scenes are less effective at least when it comes to the story, because the score is so effective and well made, most people melt and forget the inconsistencies of the story, which didn't work for me, mostly because I am not a target audience of this movie, being in my twenties and having no children.
Other problem I had is that the story had a big potential which fell through, by going through obvious and overdone paths, basically it decided to end as a perfect knot instead of a little more realist. With this point I meant to show why I didn't think the story and script are tight and perfect.
Other than this problems it follows the great productions of other Pixar/Disney collaborations, having great music and animation with little and complex details, so I would recommend this movie as a fun movie for the whole family, but don't expect, at least if you are like me, a masterpiece.
I would rate it a 6-7/10.",

Nowadays in hollywood: the story is not that appealing but is it about a minority? Then it will be very well rated. I am all for minorities but can you make it more interesting??

Coco is one of them: it brings a unique sensibility to deal with complex themes like death, in a way that doesn't underestimate the spectators and, at the same time, doesn't scare the younger ones who don't have so much experience in dealing with losses. The plot itself follows a structure we've seen before: Miguel, the young protagonist, is a talented musician who is prevented by his family from following his dreams, similarly to Remy, from Ratatouille, or Moana, from Moana: Um Sea of Adventures. Just knowing the premise or seeing the trailer, it is possible to predict some events, although some surprises have been saved until the end. However, the pace is so fluid and Pixar's storytelling is so magical that it's impossible not to be enchanted. For this, the film uses memories as a bridge that unites the world of the dead with ours. Those on the other side can only make the crossing and visit the living on Dia de Los Muertos while being remembered by their loved ones. These mementos are almost like a coin, so that those who are most celebrated in our world enjoy luxury and wealth, while those who are close to being forgotten try to make do in shacks and stilts.",

345,18 December 2017,a_chinn,8," Not as good as ""Up,"" but better than ""Cars"" 1, 2, or 3","Pixar story about a young boy who wants nothing more than to be a musician, except that his shoemaker family has forbidden music due to the boy's great great grandfather abandoning the family long ago to pursue a life as a musician (Coco is the boy's very elderly great grandmother, and daughter of the shunned musician). The film takes place during Dia de los Muertos, the Mexican holiday where families remember and celebrate their deceased relatives, and when the film's hero, Miguel, discovers his runaway relative is actually the famous star of music and film, Ernesto de la Cruz (voice by Benjamin Bratt), he sets out to seize his moment by entering a music contest, only to find himself transported to the colorful and vibrant land of the dead. There he find a world populated by skeletal deceased relatives waiting to be remembered by their families so they can return to the world of the living to once again be with their descendants and loved ones. Miguel must find a way back to the world of the living before the end of the night, but that's not as easy as he expects when he discovers his relatives in the land of the dead also continue to hold music in contempt and refuse to help unless he renounces music. But wait! Ernesto de la Cruz is a relative and a musician, but he's just as famous in death as he was in life, so for Miguel to get to de la Cruz is no easy task. Miguel is aided on his quest by Héctor, a down-on-his-luck character who claims to know de la Cruz, but who is beginning to fade away from this world because his family no longer remembers him. Without spoiling any plot points, it's the themes of family and being remembered by your children and descendants that tugs at the heart strings and is at the core of the film. Pixar does sentiment better than anyone (I still get weepy just thinking of Bing Bong's farewell scene from ""Inside Out""), where it's rarely maudlin or saccharine, and is typically genuine and easily identifiable. The idea of being forgotten by your family is one that will hit home for parents watching the film, and the themes around family connections will be identifiable for both kids and adults. Setting the story aside for a second, I haven't even mentioned the film's lively music (""Remember Me"" is a real ear-worm), it's clever sense of humor (Miguel's street dog friend steals most every scene he's in), and the film's eye-popping visuals. It's also very cool for a major studio film to not feature a single anglo character and to instead feature a characters outside the dominant culture of the United State. My main complaint about the film is it's over reliance on plot devices and episodic adventures that were rather forced and relied once too often on coincidence, but I'm sure this will only annoy adults and the kids won't even notice. Overall, ""Coco"" is a solid entry in the Pixar canon of films, and athough it's not quite up to ""Monsters Inc."" ""Up"" or ""Toy Story 3"" standards of greatness, it's still far better than any of the ""Cars"" movies.",

It also had a young protagonist who wanted to become a musician against the wishes of his family. It also took us to the bright and colourful land of the remembered. Both films also feature a large bell which plays a role in a character's demise. Now I'm not claiming that Coco ripped off 'The Book of Life'; but it has to be said that there are a lot of similarities between the two movies that cannot be ignored.

I hope Pixar/Disney gives those filmmakers half of their gross! Gee whiz! p.s. - The Frozen short before this movie was not very good.

It's a film about love, life and death, all the big themes, and not just romantic love, but love of artistry and great works, touches of the same passion that saw Ratatouille become so much more than just a rat who wanted to cook and walk like a human. Yet it all seemed a little familiar; the boy who craves a career beyond his day-to-day humdrum, and the parental figures who deny him. Who could blame him? Shoe-making is hardly the stuff of daydreams, and parents never have solid concrete reasoning when it comes to shooting down fun. They might as well have pushed him into stealing that fabled guitar.

386,31 December 2021,TaylorYee94,8, Pixar can make a grown woman cry.,"Each pixar movie builds whole other universe. Most of movies except for sci-fi genre are based on our daily life universe, the one all of us are living at the moment (sometimes history genre is based on different time but still same dimension). However, 'Coco' happens in the world where the dead and the living are connected through memories. All the specifics building this world do not have to be realistic but have to be plausible, logical, and sensible in its own dimension. For example, if nobody in the living world remembers the dead, he or she disappears eternally, 'final death'. Scanning the face and matching the pictures from family ofrenda to pass the bridge, Alebrijes becoming pets of the dead, and etc. The more details, the more colorful the movie becomes. I have to laud the whole team's imagination of creating a whole new universe and animation team's efforts to bring that imagination come true on the screen. 'Coco' is a warm-hearted family movie concerning all generation of the family. You get to appreciate what ancestors passed on and built up for your family now and will miss your grandparents. Most importantly, it reminds you that even grandparents and parents used to be someone's loved sons and daughters, and that love passes on.",

390,22 December 2017,statuskuo,9, Best Movie Of The Year,"Whether animated or not, this is a great story. And I'm not even a filthy Mexican.
This may be a response to Orange Headed Commander in Chief, because there is no way Mexico is like this. It's a gross place with bodies hanging in overpass. That aside, this is really about family. And remembering who you are and who you come from. Miguel is a headstrong pre-teen desperate to be a musician. Unfortunately, his ancestors have banned music from their...life since great great grandmother was abandoned by one. That's when Miguel takes matters in his own hand. While attempting to steal a guitar he feels is rightfully his (nice message to the thieving cholos watching).
This takes him into the mystical magical world of the afterlife. Since it is the Day Of The Dead, Miguel is a living boy in a dead man's party. This is where he learns a lot about family and friendship and love.
This movie is deep in sentiment and family love, which is a FANTASTIC message given the idiot Millenials are so dead inside, they have no clue what that means if it isn't on their smartphones. Their children will reap the benefits of this great story. I loved this movie, and if life were fair, it would win the Best Picture of 2017. Instead, it'll probably go to a movie that is homosexual in nature or other lame Hollywood causes they're quick to hypocritically abandon.

The biggest one by far is that I found the film to be overstuffed with characters that are by no means essential to the plot, which is by the way quite thin and stretched at the same time. And it goes without saying that the approach they took to tell the story is indisputably unoriginal. Let alone the familiar themes the film tackles. What makes up for these problems are: the jaw-dropping animation, the vast and vibrant world that you can't help roaming over it in your mind, and the flawlessly-executed heartbreaking final act.

I would be very surprised if this will not win the Oscar for the best animated picture!",

The first half of this movie seemed very typical and I was almost bored, knowing the plot, but then it took an unexpected twist which made me enjoy it quite a bit! The music is great and catchy, and I didn't think they could outdo the colours of Up, but this movie is very colourful. Overall, it is excellent!",
429,14 February 2020,Offworld_Colony,7, Far be it from me to speculate as to why something like this...,"...captures people's hearts and imaginations but something also appropriating culture like Isle of Dogs was marginally reviled for it. That odd effect aside, Coco was a very satisfying, very obvious, simple, but fun and beautiful and important minor entry in Pixar's pantheon.
My girlfriend's niece, at 5 years old, couldn't watch this film as the skulls apparently scared her. I look forward to the time where she begins to grasp what death is about and can shed some of her fear of it by watching this film and understanding how another culture celebrates and deals with the most natural of things.
Yes it's another animated film with a silly animal sidekick and yes it all plays out exactly as expected, with just the same beats and just as briskly, but it's visually fresh and physically comedic and touches on some of the balanced ideas about art and fame, family and sacrifice, memory and forgiveness.
Overall I enjoyed it better than I thought I would and I might even watch it again some day although there's little else to be gleaned from it, it won't be boring.",

A twist in the tale makes you realise the importance of family. Then follows a fun pre climax and emotional climax. On the whole coco is a must watch for families.,
432,1 January 2018,gavinp9,8, Extremely enjoyable film,"'Coco' is another Disney-Pixar animation instant-classic, with an excellent, touching story, good music, in testing characters and great visuals. It's also something a bit different - set in Mexico and following Miguel (Gonzalez), a boy who is accidently trapped in the Land of the Dead as he tries to escape.

The story progression is very mature , music was very nice, the world building was excellent as well something which you would see in a while.

I didn't know much about Mexico so I was actually thinking this would just be some stereotypical Mexicans, wearing sombrero and playing guitar (the movie is about that so that made me even more unwilling to watch it).

The style of the world of dead is indeed beautiful, with some especially stunning backgrounds. The spirit animals were a high point. However, the workings of the world of the dead are very troubling: when you die you end up not in paradise or Hell, but in a world much like our own, including extensive bureaucracy. And you continue to exist in this strange purgatory until you die AGAIN in a seemingly painful way. And there's no judgement beyond being remembered: evil men can continue to be powerful and happy in this afterlife, while good people can live in slums, which is pretty messed up.",

This shouldn't be confused, of course, with the mildly derogatory label of 'family-friendly', which is usually slapped on movies cobbled together to distract children, while also driving their parents to distraction. Rich, deep and profound, Pixar's films are something else altogether. They may star toys, cars, bugs, fish and rats, but they deal with universal themes like growing up, loss and depression. And now, Pixar is dealing with death as well - Coco is a bold, tender meditation on living and dying that is as morbid as it is marvellous.",

450,19 January 2019,wuksha90,10," Didn't expect much, yet absolutely LOVED it!","I watched this wonderful movie with my boyfriend when I stayed at his place for Christmas. It was such an emotional journey for me, as I ended up crying my heart out. You know how it goes. It started with a couple of small tear beads, and before I knew it, I turned into one big deluge of sobs, streams of salty rivers gushing uncontrollably from my eyes. All those feelings that had been bottled up had to surface at one point, I guess, and Coco was a perfect trigger for that. I am so grateful, though, to have such an amazing boyfriend who I love so much and who held me tight in his arms and who understood perfectly what I was going through, without the need to utter a single word. It was the anguish of grief over my mum, now just a lingering memory of my dreams, and the fact that I also miss my dad, who is alive, but with whom I don't have the best father-son relationship. After watching the movie I actually felt really good and cleansed, as if I had been reborn, all thanks to this simple yet cathartic movie. I recommend it to everyone! <3",

455,31 March 2020,kermitkid,10, Perfect,"Pixar is going back to their roots! Their last few films such as ""Brave,"" ""The Good Dinosaur"" ""Finding Dory"", and ""Cars 3"" were all mediocre, or at least below the bar of what I've come to expect from Pixar. This gets back to what put Pixar on the map in the first place: Amazing stories with a heartfelt message. The visuals in this movie are amazing! They pop off the screen! I'm amazed how Pixar manages to outdo themselves with the animation every year. They really put a lot of time, care, and effort into making this film the best it could be. The story is fantastic, has some good twists and a bit of dark humor (which is surprising from Pixar), and an important, heartfelt message that will make you emotional. The songs in this movie were fun and catchy (although it is not a musical). This is one of the few times where I agree that Pixar should win all the Oscars, as opposed to more recent years where I said that they had monopolized and stolen the awards from films I thought were superior. As hard as I tried, I couldn't find anything to nitpick. Nothing that would dock this film from being a perfect score. It's not that I didn't want to like the film, but part of being a film critic is being critical. I tried to find something, anything, that could improve this film, but as hard as I tried, I just couldn't. It's a perfect film! This will definitely win the Oscar for Best Animated Film, and this time I agree that it deserves to instead of ""It's Pixar. It wins by default.""

First, the plot finally shows not a typical European fairy tale or story, but dives into the world of Central America (Mexico). The process of how the deceased relatives come to the world of the living to visit their relatives once a year on the Day of the Dead is beautifully shown. I also really like the message of the film, which is expressed in the title of the main song: ""Remember me"". Secondly, the drawing of the cartoon is great, as always there is the amazing elaboration of little details. Third, the music is an integral and best part of the cartoon.

It was really positive about death and grieving and moving on and remembering. For such a big and complicated subject it was done so cleverly and sensitively for kids. I always hope that there is something more to this life we live and Coco helped me to remain positive about this belief. Gives me hope even though it is just a cartoon. Thankful of that.",

464,15 April 2018,FelipeCarrillo,8, Death has never before been so alive.,"Oscar-winner Lee Unkrich and Seattle Film Critics Award-winner Adrian Molina seem to be consolidated as the kings of the present-day animation because, through the ""hypothetical"" inequality of years working in the field, they have achieved, in a magnificent way, to synthesize the characteristics with greater sensitivity and affinity from their previous works to use them in a plausible co-direction that allows the film to be what it is. Likewise, it was an outstanding job what they did with the general draft or/and the original story that plays a vital role for the success of the idea, in which it's possible to catch respectful and fresh reference parallelisms to certain functional aspects present in prior flicks such as the independence representation from ""Finding Nemo"", the overcoming of a specific problem in a gracefully dynamic way from ""Monsters, Inc"", and, of course, the most perceptible, an emotional and severe final message coming together harsh reality from ""Toy Story 3."" Additional to the aforementioned two directors-screenwriters, names of the caliber of Jason Katz and Matthew Aldrich stand out in the writing for their prestige and recognition in the company, leaving, as a result, an Aldrich-Molina explosive mix that provokes the correct working of the powerhouse script. In the case of this animated feature film, death, an openly polarizing subject at present, has got a subtle, clever treatment in order to capture, in a fantastic way, the truth hiding the loss of a loved one, using accessible analogies which stir up a proactive unique masterclass in core plot idea development. About this, the whole film moves with a comfortable margin among corny drama and circumstantial comical situations that achieve, within all that unreal and hopeful context, reflect difficult and pure reality, leaning, with respect, in the ideal Mexican holiday that fits perfectly with the leitmotiv. It's clear that what makes easier the excellent final cut is the charisma and the particular essence of the story and its characters, they are pawns serving as a bridge between message and audience.",

It was a beautiful movie with a giant heart. It's a really, really sweet movie, and the story is one of Pixar's strongest in years.

His grandma physically assaults him and destroys the guitar he made. Bro no, yeah that's a no from me dog. Like the whole rest of the movie is so beautifully done, and I love it so much, but yet this critical plot point that literally the entire movie hinges on is so stupid, mundane, and unbelievable that it's just hobbles the entire movie going forward. Like I get how they think that they their great great grandfather's, or whatever, music career led to heartache and sadness but the fact that they won't even listen to or play music is just so ridiculously stupid, It is angering. If Pixar really wanted to go with this idea, they should've had Miguel already be a talented musician, who wanted to go solely in to music and not into a ""better career"".

In particular the middle section is weaker: it's a little boring and seems less inspired considering the excellent opening and finale. As far as the finale: it's great and touching, sad and happy at the same time. I found remarkable that a movie mostly watched by children is centered around the theme of death that is a painful part of life, and so the little ones can start to processing a bit this aspect.

I'm just a tad disappointed that the studio made it look like they ""borrowed"" the other film's concept (The Book of Life), yet they still know how to make it fresh enough for even the most skeptic. This one is especially a recent highlight for Pixar knowing that plenty of sequels are being/have been produced before and after this one.

503,15 January 2018,WooderIce64,10, Pixar Delivers Again,"Pixar is widely regarded as one of, if not the, best animation studios in the world. With an extensive list of beloved films, and only a few that are considered subpar, they really do hold the highest standards in the industry. With that in mind, Coco is more than a worthy addition to the Pixar family. It takes place in Mexico and follows a child named Miguel, who dreams of being a musician despite his family's hatred thereof. On Día de los Muertos, he ventures into the Land of the Dead to seek his idol Ernesto de la Cruz, a famous musician he admires. Meanwhile, his ancestors try to return him to the Land of the Living, as he will die if he stays there too long. The story is very interesting, and keeps your attention quite well. The only real downside here is that if you've watched most of the recent Disney movies, some of the twists at the end will be rather predictable. Still, that's not enough to really detract from how good the movie actually is. As you can imagine, the music plays a major part in the story. ""Remember Me"" is one of the best Disney songs lately, and possibly one of Pixar's best tear-jerkers. Given that Pixar is known for that, that's no small feat. ""Un Poco Loco"" was very good as well. As with most Pixar movies, the characters are lovable, memorable, and well written. The characters, like real families, clearly love each other and wish the best for each other, despite the conflicts they have. That realism with the characters is one of the movie's strengths. Because of that, most of the story doesn't have a proper villain, because Miguel's family - living and dead, care for him dearly. The animation is some of the best ever made, which is to be expected coming from Pixar. The Land of the Dead looks spectacular and imaginative, and the color scheme is beautiful. The imagery that appears in Día de los Muertos celebrations in Mexico is shown here, and the way its reflected in the character designs for the dead is fantastic. The accuracy that goes into characters playing guitar is also outstanding. This is easily one of Pixar's best movies. And that's really saying something.",

521,10 January 2018,tmpsvita,9, A movie with a soul,"RATING: 8,5/10 
Pixar returns after two sequels (""Cars 3"" and ""Finding Dory"") with an original film and the result, as it was for ""Inside Out"" and for most of its films, is a real success.
A success not only bound to the box office, a sector in which it went very well even if it could have done better, but above all to the consensus received by the critics, who rewarded him with excellent marks (81/100 on Metacritic) and wonderful reviews (even 97% of positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes), and by the public, which gives him a very high rating on IMDb.
But despite all these awards the film had not intrigued me at all, to the point that my vision on the big screen of Coco was even not to happen, but luckily I went to the cinema and in the end I saw this wonderful animated film of whom I had heard to the point of nausea.
Like all Pixar products, the film can count on an extraordinary animation that, in this case, is highlighted in a full-bodied way through countless colors, beautiful lights that do justice to designs that can be defined as works of art.
But beyond the incredible fantasy both in appearance and in content, what makes ""Coco"" different from all the other animated films, but which unites it to those of the same Studios, is that inside itself has a soul and you can hear it in the audience's laughter, but also in the tears that some of its scenes, of a beautiful, touching and real depth, spring up and in the eyes of the children that instead of chatting, as they would with any other film, stay there in silence because immersed in a dream that will make them grow, mature and improve.
A film of great moral and cultural importance, as well as politics (given the recent clashes between USA and Mexico), a Pixar that takes position and with much courage and imagination, explores new stories, cultures and ""worlds"".
Some sins here and there but undoubtedly minor.
In fact it is one of the most important and beautiful animated films in recent years, and not only.",

531,31 August 2021,alexscott-35299,5, The ending of this movie makes people believe it's better than it is!,"I've only ever heard good things about this movie but I never actually watched it myself, Pixar films are usually films I always see in the cinema and I rarely miss out on them because they are usually very consistent in their quality. This film isn't poorly made in the slightest, the voice acting is good the story is compelling atleast and the animation is good quality as always, there are just too many slight things that let this movie down a lot. The story isn't original at all, for people who have seen the movie 'The Book Of Life' they will all know that it is almost the exact same film just ten times better. The plot is beyond predictable, like I guessed every twist and every plot detail a mile before it was revealed. The characters are boring and don't feel like Pixar characters normally feel. The animation is good but has some moments that look so low quality, it's the spirit animals that look terrible, they tired too hard to make them bright and vibrant and doing this just makes them look 2D and flat. The ending is the best part of the movie as it is so emotional and so relatable that it has the whole audience sobbing and really connecting to the film. It's because of the ending that people tell themselves that this is a good movie but deep down it is just a very average one. I can see what they were going for and it definitely has that Pixar feel to it, but I just think that there are other films that are too similar and just quite frankly better than this one.

Nevertheless, I don't think one should have to be to enjoy this film. Coco is a fun watch, especially because of it's main characters Miguel and Hector, as well as it's unique art style. However, I wouldn't go as far as calling it the best Pixar movie ever, yet, it's certainly up there in my opinion. Coco is an overrated film for sure. Too often are above-average films like this blown out of proportion by critics. The film sort of lacks adventure, being as the whole movie takes place over the course of one night. Miguel does travel to another realm, yet, I feel still very little of the Land of the Dead is actually explored. The story is cliché, yes, but it still manages to engage the viewer and keep them interested just enough. The families ban on music seems a little silly to me, talk about overreacting. Staying on the topic of music, I wasn't really impressed with the soundtrack for this film. I usually find myself with the songs from the movie stuck in my head but not with this one. I didn't really enjoy the songs while I was listening to them either to be honest. All in all, Coco was a positive experience. I don't watch a lot of animated films but this one looked good enough to check out and I'm glad that I did.

Anyway, I stuck with it to the end and for a time it was watchable. However, when Hector's story was revealed all I could think of was how was he murdered and his family were unaware of it? How did Ernesto get away singing the songs Hector wrote and claiming they were his when Hector's family had the lyrics written in the letters he sent to his little daughter when he was away. Not to mention the main song of the movie 'Remember Me' ( as it happened, completely unmemorable) a song Hector would sing to his daughter, but, Ernesto' greatest hit which he claims to have written. Well, to get around that they have the grandmother's psychotic hatred of music and the banning of it in the home (Footloose?) But, it would be impossible to avoid it if Ernesto de la Cruz was such a huge star in his home town which is Miguel's home town. Silly, lazy plotting.

The animation is top notch. The entire Mexican culture is explained beautifully. Even if you are not a Mexican.You can easily relate to these Mexicans. And trust me. After this beautiful movie ends, you will try to mimic these people and their accent.
Talking about the story, it is completely different from the brainless entertainers made these days. Coco talks about family, sacrifice, love, passion and of course, the journey of a 12 year boy to follow his dream. This is that film which will bring tears in your eyes if you are a very emotional person, i dont generally cry in movies but this one made me cry towards the end, had tears in both my eyes and also a handkerchief by my side.

His great-great -grandfather left the family to pursue a career as a musician, and to make ends meet, his wife took to making shoes, and banished all music from the home. Miguel wants to enter the music contest for the Day of the Dead but his hopes are dashed, literally, when his grandmother smashes his homemade guitar. And this is why I give this a 9 rather than a 10. She's an utterly despicable, mean-spirited witch, and the rest of the family is too cowardly to stand up to her. At the end of the film she sheds a tear, a perfect example of what I call a Nazi With A Puppy Dog Moment, where a repugnant character gets a token humanizing moment.",

606,31 March 2020,yuenyeeac,9, COCO,"The film is based on the Mexican Day of the Dead, a story about dreams and death, and a story lingered by affection and love. Death and love are the core themes. The story revolves around the twelve-year-old Mexican boy Miguel's pursuit of a music dream. Miguel loves music, but in the concept of family, their family is cursed by music, so his dream is rejected by his family. So Miguel embarked on a dream-seeking journey secretly.
By chance, he touched a guitar, which brought him into the world of the undead. Surprisingly, instead of being cold and horrible, this world is colorful. There are hairless dogs unique to Mexico, colorful paper-cuts, delicious traditional Mexican food ... everything is the same as the real world, or even more wonderful. More importantly, in this beautiful new world, he reunited with his deceased relatives and regained his affection. At this time, Miguel's dream was no longer just a guitar, a game, but to enjoy the strong warmth supported and accompanied by his family. In the process, his dream has been sublimated and his life has become fuller.
From the perspective of literary narrative, the movie story itself does not transcend tradition. The deep connotation of ""Looking for a Dream"" is to portray an undead world with humanistic temperature and a view of life and death. Through the movie, we will even believe that death is not indifferent and lonely, there can still be loved ones and friends, there are beautiful things to meet unexpectedly, and there are dreams to chase.",

Not only it has shown that there are still those with vision and perspective in Pixar and in general US but also has given back the true feeling of art back to the animations once more. Coco tells the tale of the most humane part of all humans, family, love and art...but very cleverly this tale takes shape around the Mexican culture and traditions. At a time that US has never been more divided on many different issues and Mecicans have been pictured all as illegal immigrants and the main causes of crimes by media, Pixar shows courage and creates a masterpiece that confronts such idiotic ideas and tries to remind all people a lot of things that they forgot, the fact that we all are the same and share the same feelings and sentiments. Unlike many movies music in Coco is not just a tool to fill the uncomfortable silences but it is the real protagonist of this story...it is present at all times and you miss it if it isn't for a second. The visual effects of the movie are incredible and stunning. Everything has been done for a purpose and every character has a role to play. It made me cry twice and to be honest it wasn't the sadness or heartbreak that caused it, I was so absorbed in how they introduced the concept of death that was overwhelming for me.

The plot not only was tragic and interesting, but also did a really great job at educating everyone about El Dia De Los Muertos. The Characters are well thought out and lovable, and the music is honestly perfect.
However some of the comedy didn't feel right in this, and the villain of course is a twist.
Despite the cliche of De La Cruz being the villain, I think it still works (at least much better than a fair amount of Pixar twist villains) . I just wish they could do something new since a great majority of their films include twist villains.
I think this film is great and a very good step in the right direction for Pixar!",

639,16 April 2018,lynn_melanie,8," Coco is a very good, but unfortunately disappointing...","Coco is a very good, but unfortunately disappointing film which is far from Pixar's best works. The standout aspects are its world building which is amazing, its animation which is beautiful and pleasingly colorful and its mythology which has some very interesting concepts very well explored. The film explores death so well, it is sophisticated in that theme and it is particularly effective in the portrayal of Mexican culture and Día de los Muertos. The characterization is good and I particularly loved the second act with the fantasy adventure angle to it. But even though its emotional ending was somewhat earned, it was still too sentimental. The twist is also quite easy to predict. And its major problem is the soundtrack. Remember Me is definitely a good, well utilized song, but the rest of the songs are very weak and never at all comparable to the works of Disney. And when you have a film that is literally about music, you need to have a killer soundtrack which sadly isn't the case with Coco.",
640,4 August 2018,ikizdevran-882-254684,9, The celebration of a lifetime,"I am a huge fan of animation films. Whenever I feel bad or in the need of a friend, I choose an animation film and watch. After I finish it, I feel recharged and energetic. ""Coco"" has been on my list for a very long time, and finally I have decided to watch it last night. This was one of the best decisions I have taken for some time. This morning I woke up smiling and, so far, I am having a very good day. This is all because of this beautiful animation film. ""Coco"" is produced by Pixar. When you see this name, you should probably think about; Toy Story series, Cars series, Ratatouille, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc, Monsters University, Inside Out, Up and WALL-E. All these films have a classic story wrapped around an emotional content. In my opinion, this emotional content is the trademark of Pixar made films. In these animations, almost all the time, you hear beautiful music, witness unbelievably creative visual effects, bright colors and powerful voice cast stars, but the story is almost always a classic one and the weakest point of the chain. This, however, doesn't apply for ""Coco"". ""Coco"" has an original story as well as all the other features I have counted above. This is the reason why it has won two Academy Awards, Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Picture (Original Song: Remember Me) and Best Animated Feature Film, and while I am writing this review, it is the 63th best film on IMDB's top 250 films. ""Coco"" is directed by Lee Unkrich and co-directed by Adrian Molina. Lee Unkrich is also known as the main director of Toy Story 3 and co-director of Toy Story 2, Finding Nemo and Monsters, Inc. ""Coco's"" beautiful story is also written by him. ""Coco"" has a runtime of 105 minutes and grossed up to $807 Million against a budget of $175-200 Million. Just by looking at this huge budget, you can understand the importance of animation films for the cinema industry.",

660,7 March 2020,dabeluoki,8, A solid movie with nice twist,"This is a good movie however I do have my flaws with it, but we will get into that later. This movie follows a kid named miguel who is in love with music, however his family hates it, especially his grandmother. Now this cause a drift/ tension between Miguel and his other family members. So on his own he sneaks around pllaying music even though music of any kind is banned in his family. Well one day based of the guitar he has in his family photo he believes Ernesto de la cruz his idol and music legend is his father and after stealing his character from his sanctuary he transported to the world of the dead. Now in order to get back home he needs to receive a blessing from one of his dead family members before the raise or death awaits him.
Now lets talk about some of the characters. Miguel is a generic character who wants to do what he believes in, but unfortunately his family won't let him. Nothing special, but works for this movie.
Now Abuelita the grandmother on the other hand is such an annoying character. Its to unrealistic for her to hate music so much to the point she dictates the entire family to stop listiening or playing music all together.
Ernesto de la cruz is a cool character on the other hand, and the quite frankly the usual disney twist villain really worked here. Although I will say how we find out he actually killed Miguel real great great grandfather Hector was so stupid. He basically admitted it in a moive lol.
Imelda who is miguel great great grandmother is an arlgiht character. She hates Hectpr because he frankly did abandon his family to pursue his music dreams, which is completely understandable. Although still banning all music is kind of dumb. Regardless I really like how she cares for miguel and they are family and she really does want im to get back home. Although she wants all music of his to be banned is very stupid and I very much dislike how she basically in love with Hector again even if she finds out the truth. At the end of the day Hector still left his family alone with no means to make money until Imelda eventually started a shoe buisness.
Now lets talk about the best character in the show Hector. The dude just doesn't want to be forgotten by his daugher coco in the living world because when your forgotten in the day of the dead I guess that means you cease to exist. Anyway his personality was great, he goes from being some immature  con artist to a likeable kind man. Although I would have preferred if you know maybe he was a bad as family made him out to be and for him to had been forgotten, I understand this is a kids movie. So in all honesty the twist with him actually had wanted to comeback to his family, but Ernesto food poisoned him was still great and I'm glad he gets the due credit he deserves for all songs he wrote that Ernesto took credit for. Now the callback with how Ernesto gets a bell falling on him in the dead word which is the exact way on how he died in the living world was nice. Although him being forgotten didn't make the mose sense to me....like what only a year past since he was defamed and your tellining no one remembers him anymore.",

662,28 October 2017,dcwonderful,9, Pixar has done it again!,"Let me start of by saying that as Mexican born and resident, I found this movie very respectful and honest about our culture. So, watch it without any guilt! ""COCO"" tells the history of Miguel, a music- loving boy trapped on a shoe maker family that happens to hate music for generations, this is because his great-great grandmother was left by a musician. After breaking his family rule of ""no music"" he embarks on an adventure through the world of the dead. This is Disney at its finest, a powerful movie with a powerful message, even though I found it to be more on the WDAS territory, it is clearly a Pixar trademark. I cannot speak about the voice acting in general since I watched in Spanish, but for that matter the cast was very well developed here in Mexico and they made a wonderful job on that department. Gael Garcia's did same voice as in the English version at least I can say that he did a very nice job as Hector. The only thing I didn't like about the movie (And the reason I subtract 1 star out of the 10 maximum) was the third act, which I found It to be very cliché with a very, very old trope found in lots of movies and even regular TV shows and cartoons (I ain't going to spoil anything), but don't worry, it is compensated with the rest of the movie which I found it be very clever and emotional all the way through. And of course! As an old Disney-Pixar tradition this movie is one hell of a Tear-Jerker so don't forget to bring your tissues to the theater. I'm sure you and your family will enjoy this movie so go see it, you won't regret it.",

676,30 November 2017,tfclougher,10, Pagan stereotypes,"Some feel that COCO honors pagan holdovers. The ""genius"" of Christianity of the Roman Catholic sort was to adapt what people had to teach a lesson. Look at the Chinese. Missionaries, Catholic and Protestant, saw ancestor worship as idolatry. Now they say it is merely remembering the past, learning the good from it and letting go of the failures. Christmas came from the Saturnalia. During that time, Romans were ordered to be cheerful and generous. On one of the days, servants and masters reversed roles, getting back to the golden age when men were one and in community. Besides who lets anyone freze or starve during the deadliest, darkest time of year. All Saints Day took over Samhain, the Druidic first day of winter when the boundaries between the worlds went down. Saints have always been those who are ""with God"", doing good, being human beings, mensches. Some are declared to be with God and ""worthy of imitation"". The idea of the soul is a pagan construct. The Hebrews believed that you did not worship God from the grave. But God is abstract, no dimension or measurement, Being itself, not a being among other beings. God is present where there is Truth, Justice, Charity. And the dead are still ""with God"" if they were with God in life. They are with God in memory. As the elder Muslim said in a Town Called Alice, ""Who cares for women and children has God not far from him,"" when asked to help wandering mothers and their children in Japanese-occupied Malayia in 1942. All Saint and All Souls teach that: remember the good that your family did and follow it. They loved you. Love others. It is an ordinary concept for ordinary people. It is not some ritual performed at a High Mass in the Cathedral for the rich hacienda owners or the capitalist elite. It is Francis of Assisi, pedestrian, barefoot, not a priest, not in the hierarchy, looking for the man or woman who needs help or a helping hand, who works alongside the men and women in the fields or the factories, who dresses in overalls. So there. COCO has that kind of heart.",

Because I wasn't aware it was Disney-Pixar (because I am stupid), I sat through the Olaf bewildered and freaking out on what was happening, while people by my side were just enjoying it. And midway I got the wind of things and was finally calm. The movie began with something that always bothered me, why unnecessary 3D nowadays and it from the start itself made the statement it is a 3D movie. We get to see the story of a boy who loves music, but their family doesn't, which is totally preposterous and downright impossible to believe, but believe me, there's fun around these situations And movie does a good job in putting the Mexican tradition and customs out there subtly, but not letting what the movie wants to speak get in its way. That was a job well done. Then we get to the Land of Dead (because if you steal from the dead, you get transported there, which seems like most people must have gone there, but let's move on..) and oh my that scene where the shot spanned from the bridge to the place was beautiful! You might be wondering if all dead people live here how do they cramp in together, well they have built houses upwards and downwards and people who r not remembered die? from that place and it seems like a place for only Mexicans? No racism intended. But they let things that matter explain the mechanisms of the Land of Dead than just show how things work. Job well done there too! Here he meets his whole family but a series of situations meant he has to get to 'his great great grandfather' Ernesto DE la Cruz. Through these adventures we get to see cool stuff about this world and we finally see him play guitar here. Then you have to pull out your rabbit and other surprises in pocket but I got the wind of who was actually his great great grandfather and that twist was quite okay. Then there's the 3rd act of trying to get the photo, which could be the only possibly and very nit picky thing that could displease critics, though I enjoyed all the songs and fun. Then there's the final act and man that was so moving. I was desperately trying to hold back any tears and I heard some sniffling by some audience members. Midway many might have forgotten who Coco is, but it all gets there to the scene with all the family and it was so good, SO GOOD. A very emotional and strong finish. Sadly coco dies but it's a happy death. Loads to talk about, but some things should stay unsaid.",

The movie's storyline was quite boring. It's about a boy named Coco who loves to play his guitar. He has a grandfather who was famous for his songs, who was later killed by a bell in 1942. A problem is that Coco's family doesn't like music. So Coco's grandmaother destroys his guitar. Coco later goes to his grandfathers grave and takes his grandfather's guitar.

I did not anticipate loving this movie so much or being so emotionally touched by it. The writing is clever and authentic. The story is heartwarming and funny. It covers the subject of the afterlife with both grace and levity, respectfully bringing ""Dia de los Muertos"" and its customs into the mainstream consciousness. Just lovely. Coco is funny, inventive, and thought-provoking. The actors did a fantastic job of bringing the playful and earnest characters to life so warmly - including the adorable pets. The esthetics throughout are visually pleasing, probably because the vibrant colors are so mesmerizing. The plot centers around family, customs, honoring ancestors, educating younger generations, following dreams, and realizing maybe we don't have the full story or aren't always right. It handled touchy subjects like death and the afterlife beautifully - honestly, so much more effectively and enjoyably than, say, the recently released ""Soul, which was cute but no ""Coco!"" ""Coco"" is certainly Pixar's finest film in a while. Absolutely loved it!",
687,27 December 2020,Jodro2,8," Great movie, pity about the music","The movie is excellent: a great script with tons of surprising twists and turns and a message that goes beyond the usual Hollywood 'go for your dreams' fare, tons of funny gags, and fantastic visuals. Just one major drawback: the music is mediocre. Mexico has an amazingly rich music tradition, but the songs in this movie are just flawed pastiches that do no justice whatsoever to that tradition. Remember Me is just about OK, the rest is totally forgettable. The tragedy is that it affects the story, because it makes Miguel's musical aspirations and love of Ernesto de la Cruz much harder to understand. But if you can get past the average music, the story a wonderful.",

There are moments where it gets a bit cringe worthy, it kind of slows to a crawl at points, and it struggled to keep my attention at times, but it's a solid movie. The best part of the movie was at the tail end of it. Roughly, the last 30 minutes was the most exciting and entertaining part of the movie. I honestly would have liked the movie to have followed that plot point a bit more, but it does set the lore of the world really well. I do feel like I waited too long to see it, though. It maybe would have had a greater impact on me a few years ago. Right now, I just sort of feel like it was a solid, but standard movie. Not bad, but also not really living up to all the hype that I'd heard about it at the time. I often find that to be the case with movies that get super hyped by the general public, though. I'd watch it again, but I would also be okay with missing the first half of the movie and coming in on the latter half where things get really good. I will say this, the colors were beautiful. It was such a wonderfully colorful movie. I wish that I could have been younger when I saw this. I think if I had been, it would have resonated with me more. As it is, it's quite decent. Very good even. It just didn't hold my attention as well as I would have liked, and the most interesting and entertaining part of the movie was more of a footnote to the main movie. As to how well Pixar embraced and represented the culture, I can't really speak for it myself. It seems like they embraced it all very well, but far be it for me to say for certain without knowing enough about it.",

Coco however is much more of a typical Disney movie full of one-dimensional characters and completely unoriginal plot where one can guess the ending after watching the first five minutes. It is a well executed animation, that does a pretty decent job of keeping your attention while it is still going, but it leaves absolutely nothing behind, the moment it is over. It was a great idea to set this during the day of the dead Mexican festival, yet one original idea about the setting is simply not enough to make a a full-featured film around.",

Since the story itself happened on the night of the Day of the Dead, the living person greeted the dead in a cheerful way, and mourning became part of the carnival. Therefore, the tone of the film is not dark and negative, but it has sadness and nostalgia inseparable from death. Among the two temperaments, ""Looking for a Dream"" should be the least laughable part of Pixar's work, but it is also bright and light. The highlights of the film return to the characteristics that a good movie should have, that is, a group of flesh-and-blood characters, a convincing twist and turn story, and the strong emotions that erupt in it.",

This is my particular view. Now, about the movie itself... I am a writer. I've watched about 80% of Disney movies, and still I was surprised. Maybe I didn't board with much faith, because people kept telling my I'd love it. But when the twist came, and I was unaware, I burst into tears. Now, I am a 28 year old person, I did not expect the story to be so engaging, or their message to be so heart breaking, it transceeds generations and brings us closer to our families and dreams. Unfortunately, my grandmother passes away one year ago, so it made me understand the importance of REMEMBERING even more. Not only remembering, but also keeping the traditions alive and never let the flame of our ancesters perish. I absolutely love this picture, and I'll go back to it many, many times in my life.",

The story, oh the story! The fact that it's centered so literally around family,I feel is a unquie angle for any family movie (ironically). The depths it goes to and the emotions it provokes are incredible.
Again like so many animations these days I feel there's enough entertainment for children to enjoy however there's so much that's highlighted it creates a real raw emotion in adults alike.
For me personally (from Britain)teaching children how other countries celebrate festivals from their heritage is so important. I think the film really shows the importance of being true to yourself and at the same time showing consideration for others that may not always agree with your interests. Traditions are there for a reason (possibly nostalgia) but new ones can also be created and have value in the grand scheme of things.",

There are inhumane plans to prevent their passage in the territory of the United States as it is to build a famous border wall and among many other things. Therefore, having a large American company import a film of protagonists and Mexican history can have a great impact on American society. These companies are Disney and Pixar that have marked the lives of many children and young people for several years. Accompanying this, the purpose of children's films, in addition to entertaining children, is to promote values and carry a deep and real message that maybe the child does not understand at the moment but that parent or manager who accompanies him to watch the movies understands it and in some way, it moves him. Therefore, most of the time the movies educates both; the infant and adult. Mentioning that, I can say I liked the film because, besides being created by an American company that accepts these people, the American population has the opportunity to learn more about the Mexican culture an realize that we all go through similar adversities... we are all humans.",

756,23 April 2018,paigerawls,10, Dia De Lo Muertos,"Day of the Dead is a holiday based on remembrance of loved ones. During this holiday people put up photos on their ofrendas, light candles, and celebrate life while honoring the dead. The movie Coco represents Day of the Dead and the Latino/a culture accurately. I don't believe that it undermines the culture in any way, shape, or form.
In the movie, Coco Miguel steals from one of his family members. He soon ends up in the spirit world. During this holiday family members are supposed to give to the dead and they have to put their photos on the ofrenda. The legend is that when they do this the spirits can cross over from the spirit world to the living world. When they get to the real world they celebrate with their family members and have the time of their lives. According to a 2007 Business news article, ""The souls of deceased loved ones come back on El Dia de Los Muertos and mingle among us.""(McClatchy) This evidence shows us how much the movie actually relates to Day of the Dead and tells a story about it. Not many movies about different cultures truly represent the culture, as well as Coco has.
In the movie, his great-grandfather cannot cross over the bridge to the other world because he does not have a picture in his ofrenda. Having a picture on your family's ofrenda means more than people actually think. According to TCA Regional news, ""Gifts, keepsakes, and food--things that the departed enjoyed--generally are placed at the altar.- The traditional belief is that these offerings, or ofrendas, will coax the dead to visit the living.""(Jones) I believe the movie didn't show this as well as it should have. In the movie, it seemed like the dead only wanted to spend time with their family and the things that they placed on the altar didn't lure them out of the darkness instead it was the life of their family. I believe that the movie should have shown this side just as much as seeing their family.
Many people undermine this holiday they think it's creepy how people want to remember the dead. This holiday is more than honoring the dead it's a vibrant cultural tradition to celebrate the life that we have. We should always enjoy the little things and look to the future instead of dwelling in the past. These family members and friends should be remembered as best they can by living your life and not being sad that these people have passed. According to Antiques and collecting magazine, ""Day of the Dead is, despite its name-a vibrant celebration of life,""(Trecker) I feel like this movie portrayed this very very well. It may have been a sad story but it showed us that even though this holiday is about recreating memories of loved ones and remembering who has passed, it's really more a celebration with your family. It's also about all the great things they did in their life.
This movie is one of my favorites and part of that is by how much I actually learned about the culture. It doesn't show any false representations about Day of the Dead instead they figured out a way to make it more entertaining. It did not undermine the Latino/a culture instead it made people understand the culture more accurately. Coco is one of the best cinematic representations of Day of the Dead.",

Inside/Out was pretty terrific, but the midas touch appeared to be wearing off a little bit for this storied studio of animation. So, when I ended up going to see Coco almost unexpectedly, I didn't really have any set expecations for what I was going to experience. I had seen the teaser trailer way back in the summer, and my first thought was that it was kind of ripping off Book of Life, which I loved. After the interminable Frozen short before the film (which wasn't bad per se, but it was long, way too long to play before a 100 minute children's movie), Coco began and I was transfixed from start to finish.

767,23 April 2018,garveysl-36347,8, Culturally Accurate,"The accurate and well depicted movie Coco is historically correct in their way of showing Dia de los Muertos. It shows how certain factors are portrayed in real life and in the film remain the same in every family like having ofrendas.What is included on the ofrendas is the part that changes from family to family. 
Coco had a good representation of the ofrendas because of how they used the yellow marigold flowers leading their loved ones from their graves back to their home. They also had some of the dead relatives favorite things like favorite food, drink, and even piece of clothing, are put on these altars. Other families eat the favorite food instead of placing it on the altars for the dead. In the movie, Dante eats food off of the ofrenda and Miguel yells at him saying it is for their ancestors not him. According to Lara Medina, ""The cempasúchil (marigold flower), with its bright color and strong sent, leads the dead to the altars. Candies, incense, photos, food and drink that the dead enjoyed while living enhance the offering"" (176-177). This quote helps show the historical value or the relationship between what happens during Dia de los Muertos and how it is almost the same as it is in Coco. The quote explains how they use specific items in their lives to help make the home or the altar feel more like a family display of memories. In the movie, they have the skull candy heads on the altars, they have the marigold flowers leading from the graves back to their home, and they have pictures of every dead ancestor represented on the ofrenda. 
Another example from Coco is how Miguel's grandmother, Coco's daughter, makes a huge deal about how the ofrenda has to look and be presented. She feels this way because it is the first thing the family sees when walking into the room because it is so extravagant with so many colors, and items on display. It is also again, how their past family is remembered and what was important to them in life to show their support and their gratitude for them being apart of their family. The ofrenda also helps remember what generations passed down through the family. In Miguel's family, it is the shoe business. His family is very driven to make sure he doesn't become a musician, and by doing that they pressure him or show him he is a shoemaker at heart. Medina writes, ""For the Mexica, during the last three days of the tenth month, the dead came back to interact symbolically with their families"" (176-177). This quote helps support the idea of family heritage represented on the ofrenda in Coco because if Miguel's ancestors came back and saw a guitar on the ofrenda instead of shoes, there would be trouble and no one in the family would be happy for the change in tradition. It also helps explain how the dead watches over the living through the ofrenda, through their pictures, through the memories of their families.
Incorporating the aspect of the dead and the living joining together during this festive holiday is shown throughout the film, but is shown the most at the end. When Miguel can finally play the guitar in front of his family and all of his ancestors are dancing around him and enjoying their presence. A piece of evidence edited by J. Gordon Melton states, ""In Mexican culture it includes a belief in the unity of death and life"" (382). This evidence is shown in the film because it talks about the belief of death and life coming together to celebrate this holiday as one. In Coco when the dead travels over the marigold bridge to see their family, they can only pass if their family has something of theirs presented on the ofrenda. If not, they cannot visit. This relates to the quote because the dead want to be able to visit their family and be united with them for one day but, the family has to want them to visit in return. Like Hector and how the family did not want him to be able to come see his family and to see Coco again. 
Overall, in regards to Dia de los Muertos and Coco, the movie was very descriptive and historically accurate. It gave or showed in depth thought to how they represented the ofrendas and how it is important to the basis of the holiday. It shows how the ofrenda is where the holiday's heart or core is because without the ofrenda, the family members cannot visit or come back to see family.",

770,23 April 2018,hauchdc,10, Day Of The Dead Authenticity/movie review,"I would rate the movie Coco (directed by Lee Unkrich) a 10/10 in terms of all-around entertainment and Cultural accuracy. The cultural piece I want to focus on the most is the depiction of El Dia de Los Muertos more specifically how accurate their traditions were in the movie and see if they accurately celebrated the famous Spanish holiday. One of the most important traditions of El Dia de Los Muertos is the offering table, every family has their own offering table where everything on it serves as a symbol for something else(Avila, Lisa. ""A Day To Remember Family."" A Day To Remember Family, 5 Nov. 2011, pp. 1-1.Elibrary.). This held true in Coco where on Miguel's offering table he had old shoes of his shoemaking ancestors and some of their favorite meals and snacks all offering as a symbol of something they liked or did in their past life. Another common thing to do on El Dia de Los Muertos is to visit the graveyard for a big party. Families bring a huge feast to eat while they clean tombstones, sing songs, and talk to their ancestors(Kelleher, Elizabeth. ""Day of the Dead."" Kids' Games, Animals, Photos, Stories, and More, National Geograohic Kids, 28 Sept. 2016, kids.nationalgeographic.com/explore/celebrations/day-of-the-dead) .

791,7 January 2018,clark-ingleton,10, Pixar is back!,"Coco is the latest from Pixar, starring Anthony Gonzalez, Gael Garcia Bernal, Benjamin Bratt, Alanna Ubach and a string of many others, and is directed by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina.
 It tells the (in some ways familiar) story of Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez), whose family upbringing revolves heavily around shoe making, and the business of shoe sales being the career path of all family members and many generations. Miguel, however, dreams of being a musician and breaking out in the arts, much to the strict disapproval of his family. He looks up to his idol, legendary musician, Ernesto De La Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), playing the classical Mexican-infused sounds of the 30s and 40s. Along the way to achieving this dream, Miguel finds himself in The Land of the Dead, where he meets a series of deceased skeletal characters, such as Hector (Gale Garcia Bernal), Mama Imelda (Alanna Ubach) and Ernesto De La Cruz himself (Benjamin Bratt), all of whom were involved in Miguel's past and/or family in some way.
 So this is a film where I deliberately don't want to give away too much of the plot and the twists and turns within, because there are some surprises thrown into this very tightly written screenplay, helmed by directors Lee Unkrich, Adrian Molina and two others. Usually a bad sign when there's more than a few writing credits (Spider-Man: Homecoming), Coco succeeds for a number of reasons. 
 As mentioned, parts of the story will be familiar to many, but this is an example of when it's the details of the film that truly make it, as opposed to the overall general big picture. To quote Roger Ebert, ""it's not about what it's about, it's about how it's about it"". In common storytelling, there's only very few general story outlines we here from synopsis to synopsis, movie to movie, but it's the details and variations of those storylines that truly make a film. Examples are tone, pacing, dialogue, music, performance, world building, sound design, editing, themes and infinite other styles and subtexts. In the case of Coco, the pace and charm and wit and energy behind the, in theory, familiar storyline and themes are what makes it.
 This truly is a wonderful, uplifting and entertaining piece by Pixar. The directions the story takes, as is the case with most original Pixar films, is complex and thematic. It deals with memory, death, dementia, passion, drive, family values, rebellion and more, while still remaining accessible and child friendly, unlike Inside Out, which I know is an unpopular opinion. But most of all Coco is damn fun! The colours simply explode and radiate, and the animation of the character, world, production design and environment is truly arresting and detailed, without feeling overloaded and bloated. 
There's bits in the beginning that were reminding me of a less traumatising/horrifying, and more Disneyified Spirited Away, in a ""innocent character suddenly finds themselves thrown into an unfamiliar parallel universe full of the macabre"" kind of way. 
 I think my few flaws with the film are simply that it could've been a little funnier. All throughout there's fun slapstick, such as feral yet charming dog is so excited that it's drooping tongue wraps around its head, and skeletons being able to pull themselves apart and change body shapes etc, which would have been an animator's dream to create. I didn't find that there were memorable laugh out loud jokes, such as the sloths, or The Godfather throwback in Zootopia, or many other hilarious scenes you come away from gawking about from other Pixar works, such as Monsters Inc, the Toy Stories and The Incredibles. There's also things revolving around the story which I don't want to give away, but just very minor nitpicks surrounding tiny character decisions/reactions/motivations that perhaps don't quite click perfectly in place.
 Overall Coco is a movie I could recommend to anyone and everyone over the age of 5, it's the most emotional I think I've ever been in a Pixar film, there's true beauty and charm behind it, the story and characters are all very engaging, the voice acting and singing/music is beautiful, particularly from the talents of Anthony Gonzalez, look out for him in the future. It's paced excellently, the 103 minutes fly by, and the songs are simply lovely.",

For a child it might be something special (or scary according to some kid after screening), seeing the colours of Mexican afterlife and that brave little protagonist. 90% of Disney animations are like that. And what bothered me the most was the wrong picture of death. ""I can't wait when you die"" is not funny, even if said by a dead man. Also you can die after death. First you die, then - if noone remembers you - you die again and noone knows where you go. For me it was the easy screenwriting. Even after death you're scared of death.",

799,9 April 2018,kate-stuart,10, coco,"""Coco Montrese, in the challenge we were raised from the dead, but on the runway your Latino blood was muy caliente. You're safe.
Seldom does a movie inspire me and propel me to what's best in filmmaking. Coco is one of those rare films you watch that become an instant classic. And yes, the lustful visuals and the upbeat and melodic songs are a great part of the experience but what makes this movie great, is its emotional sincerity, expertly complemented by Giacchino'a score. It's clear that this movie was based around a simple premise and a love for telling stories. And when that happens, everything else is so much easier. What Coco does fantastically and what so many movies fail to do is building a connective tissue that amounts to something greater than the movie itself, as if the fibres collide to do movie magic. When we reach the climax, it feels so earned because it's simple and because it's based on sincerity. Yes, the driving force of Coco comes from the beautifully apparent simplicity in its storytelling. It's a movie that is both a stunning visual spectacle and a touching piece of art. Also, in a time when racial segregation repeats its cycle of power, it's unusually brave to have an American studio make such a radiant homage to that culture, taking the pre-emptive measures for it to be an honour, not a steal. It comes as a surprise to nobody when I say that this film will leave you emotional (granted you belong to the human race). It's uncontrollable, it's within you to be moved when you have accompanied a character and watch the climax unfold and feel like you have earned the right to cry. And normally climaxes are huge and loud but Coco keeps it simple and quiet as moments that really strike a chord often are. What's also not so common is the movie's thematic lines, as you can't help to find incredibly brave that betrayal, murder and death are topics that the movie delves in profusely (yet never tackily). In the year in which Inside Out was release, that was, hands down, my favourite movie of the year. And, damn you Pixar, it will probably be again this year. At the end of the day, you sometimes go to the movies expecting a certain familiarity, something that you can rely on. Coco feels just like coming back to a loving home, it has the sweet scent of your grandmother's cake, it's as cosy as your childhood bedroom and it reminds us of the reason we keep coming back to these movies: to feel the warmth of the purest form of cinema.""",

Being a Pixar film, Coco appeals toward emotionally compelling moments, focusing on the power of love and family that never fails to make the audience cry. The young boy, Miguel Rivera, voiced by Anthony Gonzalez, takes us all on an exciting adventure that one can only imagine. Coco is a heartwarming family entertainer about the importance of family and a well-crafted coming of age story that also captures the beautiful traditions of Mexico. If you are looking for a story of family and legacy expressed through the storytelling and song of Mexican tradition, be sure to watch Disney Pixar's animated film Coco. In Santa Cecilia, Mexico, twelve-year old Miguel lives with his whole family. Miguel is a kindhearted child who loves music and idolizes once famous singer-songwriter, Ernesto de la Cruz. He dreams of becoming a musician against his family's wishes because his great-great-grandmother Imelda banned music in the family ever since her husband left her and their daughter, Coco, to pursue his music career. The movie takes place on El Día de los Muertos (the sacred Day of the Dead), an annual tradition in which the souls of the dead are able to return for a reunion with their living family members. It all starts when Miguel accidentally removes the photo sitting in the center of the family ofrenda of Coco with her parents and discovers that her father, Miguel's great-great-grandfather, whose face was torn out, was holding the famous Ernesto's guitar. Believing that his great-great-grandfather was indeed Ernesto de la Cruz and desperate to show his musical talent, he heads out to enter a talent show that was going on. Realizing that he needs a guitar, he sneaks into Ernesto's mausoleum and ""borrows"" the famous guitar to use in the talent show. All of a sudden he becomes invisible to the living and discovers that he is cursed for stealing from the dead. Miguel then finds himself in the Land of the Dead and must return to the Land of the Living before sunrise or he will become one of the dead. However, in order to return he must receive a blessing from a member of his family that can undo the curse placed upon him, so he seeks Ernesto for a blessing. Following a mysterious and exciting chain of events he encounters Hector, a skeleton who once played in a band with Ernesto, who offers to help him find him. In return, Hector asks Miguel to take his photo back to the Land of the Living to be put on the ofrenda, so he can visit his daughter before she forgets him and he disappears completely. The two go on a wild adventure to seek Ernesto and dark history is unfolded leading Miguel to figure out that Hector is actually his great-great-grandfather, not Ernesto. The film concludes with Imelda giving Miguel a blessing, with no conditions attached, so he can return to the Land of the Living. He sparks Coco's memory of Hector and she gives him a picture to place on the ofrenda. The final scene takes place one year later with Hector's picture happily back on the family ofrenda allowing him to return and reunite with Coco and the rest of his family. Beyond the main plot points, there are many other aspects that make this movie such a great one. One of the most interesting things about this movie is the way that its plot is built around the members of Miguel's family, living and dead. While exploring the Land of the Dead, Miguel is also able to experience and participate in the activities and traditions of Mexico which allows the audience to experience it as well. Some of the individual elements, such as the portrayal of the Day of the Dead, are very accurate and recognizable to those familiar with the tradition. Coco is filled with vibrant visuals and beautifully designed characters with stunning imagery like the bridge of yellow and orange petals that connects the two worlds. Accompanied by Oscar award winning ""Remember Me"" for best original song by songwriters Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez it captures the audience's imagination with humor and heartwarming moments. Lastly, the messages in the movie are powerful and beautiful and relates to both children and adults for everyone to enjoy. Coco is one of the most loved movies in America today as it focuses on the importance of family and the power of Mexican tradition and music which has never been seen before in a Disney-Pixar movie and I highly recommend it.",

The story tells about Miguel, a young boy who wants to be a musician but his family hold a grunge against music. However, this is not without any reasons. Miguel goes on incredible journey and he finds out everything about his family. 
The music of this film is perfect, I am not surprised ""Remember Me"", one of the song won an award, as the song is really touching and meaningful. The moral that I could take from this movie, about love between family, is conveyed in a perfect way.

There was a lot of gorgeous and colorful moments, and all the characters look individual! It's pretty refreshing to see strong matriarchs in a Pixar movie. The storyline I found it a bit predictable and the way they changed between english and spanish a bit odd (it's not like they are supposed to be speaking english at any point? So what are the switches supposed to symbolize?) but a nice opportunity to learn a couple of new phrases of a new language. There's also some thrilling moments and just enough Though the biggest joy I found with Coco was how curious it made me to find out more after all it taught me about this wonderful holiday and the spirituality behind it! 
I think there is a nice message about loving your family but also accepting their differences and individuality. Definitely a movie I could see being a big favourite, if it just got the promotion it deserved.",

 Also, I really enjoyed hearing spanish and I think that it wove in really well.
The songs were so much fun and I think that I will be listening to them all day long now.
This movie really touched me, especially Hector's plot was so moving. I cried twice and tears are still falling down my cheeks whilst I'm writing this review. 
I must say, that the plot was really unexpected, there were some twists that I didn't expect and that's a rare thing when it comes to animations (same like in zootopia).
Afterall, the moral this movie learns is to love both your family and music. It is connected very nice in the scenario. Loved this movie, no wonder it won an Academy Award",

I made this account just to tell you they are wrong. Word of advice, do not listen to any of them. This movie was absolutely beautiful. An animated movie that makes me cry, and I mean actually cry, is a rarity, and this movie did just that. I don't want to speak on behalf of the Mexican people regarding the cultural accuracy of this movie, but in my opinion it did a great job of showing a beautiful tradition in a way that everyone can appreciate. Most of the bad reviews were calling it boring and predictable, but I'm convinced they are either brainless or watched the wrong movie. The twist at the end caught me completely off guard. The story was heartwarming, the visuals were beautiful, and the characters were well thought out. This movie deserves every bit of praise it gets, I cannot recommend it enough.",

Both the kids and parents loved it! I would recommend it fully - especially for adults. A wonderful plot line. Terrific characters. Great music. Animation like I've never seen. Characters are fully developed. If there was a temptation to stereotype, it never creeps into the characters or interactions. The skin, features, expressions, movements: With the animation, you forget the characters aren't ""real"" - they seem real all the time, when they ask a question, respond, react. Marvelous. The story line is complex with plenty of complications and cross overs. Had to keep listening, keep watching to pick up the facts and bring them into alignment with the story as it developed and as it surprised. The music .... ""Remember Me"", ""It's All Relative"", ""Adios Chicharron"", ""The World Es Mi Familia"", ""Skeleton Key Escape"".... I liked them all and there are many many more.

Art is emotion and Coco delivers more emotion and heart than some of us can bear, I've had this film stuck in my mind for over a month now and I can't get over it, maybe, just maybe because it didn't actually land in my head but in my heart.

The whole plot revolves around it.
Now tell some story without spoiling it..There is a child who help his great grand mother not to forget her father who had left her due to make his career in music and now he is in some kind of spiritual world. Yeah, this seems so simple but believe me, it is not. How beautifully the whole plot is presented with the essence of emotions of love and honesty, it is remarkable.
You will completely be trapped with the silent sparkle of this movie and it is also the effect of the melodious songs when they just appear at the right moment.

899,8 April 2018,donovanwyatt-50274,7," I have to say few words, Pixar","The nitpicky asshats will point out why the movie's called Coco since they did the Legend of Zelda thing where the titular character isn't the protagonist and is instead a kid named Miguel. But that's not the point. I admit the movie gave off a bad first impression not simply because of Pixar's decline in quality in recent years but also because the teaser trailer gave off the impression that it was going to be a Book of Life knockoff. Although in that movie, he doesn't even die until the third act which trailers made the main selling point. However, that has always been Pixar's thing. The trailers make the movie look like your generic animated comedy but are more than that. And Coco is no exception. Once again, Pixar demonstrates how they're still the best in the business when it comes to modern animated movies. They're not terrified of moral guardians, something which even DreamWorks succumbed to after How to Train Your Dragon 2 despite what my opinions have to say about that. The animation is beautifully crafted. The animators once again worked their asses off and it shows. There's always a fine level of detail added. It deals with the themes of death from a child's perspective amazingly well and balances out slapstick antics with skeletons and a fine level of poignancy especially near the end of the movie. The music. Oh, God, the music. It's practically tearjerking. Bring some onions as an excuse for crying. Since most of Pixar's cast and crew was Latino, it showed that this was indeed Pixar's love letter towards Mexican culture, specifically Dia de los Muertos. Nothing feels like it's racist. There's is a predictable plot twist since we're constantly whacked on the head about a certain fact regarding Miguel's family but what movie hasn't done that? I think that was the writer's point. That you shouldn't make blind beliefs based solely off of pictures. Looks can be deceiving. Family comes first, all dreams have their own limitations, we should always consider the consequences of pursuing fame. And also, don't steal on the Day of the Dead if you're Mexican. Much like Inside Out and, to a lesser extent, Finding Dory, Coco shows that Pixar still hasn't lost their touch. Let's hope Incredibles 2 is just as awesome as the first movie. It has the same director though given Tomorrowland's reputation, we might have to be wary when going to see it. Only time will tell.",

913,24 September 2020,englishreview18,10, Coco & Culture; Does Coco accurately depict the culture?,"Pixar's Coco is a story based on the Mexican holiday Día de Muertos. The film displays how the holiday and music are a big part of Mexican culture. The depiction of vibrant colors, sugar skulls, and family heritage make the movie sentimental yet somewhat historical, and represents this spiritual heritage. A ground-breaking movie, Pixar was able to create, animate, and bring to life a story about a young boy, his family heritage, and their resentment of music.
The holiday itself, Día de Muertos, plays a large part in the movie. The main character, Miguel, celebrates it yearly with his family. It's a time where all of his ancestors who have passed away can come and visit their living family. Because of his family history, and his great-great grandfather leaving his great-great and great grandmas to support themselves while he follows his dream of music, his immediate family hates and rejects any type of music. A personal shocker to me, because music plays a big part in almost every culture. A mystery to Miguel, he has to play music in secret.
Because I was shocked to see that Miguel's family rejects any type of music, I was intrigued to see how Miguel would react and pursue his love for music without his family finding out. His grit and motivation to get around these obstacles is something that made the plot of the movie stronger. He often would go to the cemetery where the Día de Muertos festivities are held, and once a musician allowed him to hold and play his guitar. But his family found him and forced him away from the musician, his guitar, and the cemetery and they told him not to go back.
Miguel's favorite musician, the late Ernesto de la Cruz, is someone he looks up to. The way he honors and worships de la Cruz ties back to the Día de Muertos tradition, as he has a type of shrine hidden away in what looks like an attic. Miguel even later finds out he's related to de la Cruz, as he is his great-great grandfather, or so Miguel thought. It's a great representation and ties back to how important this holiday is, and how he is able to also love music through it. Pixar's depiction of the holiday while also animating it into a movie for all is great, and very creative and versatile when it comes to incorporating and fusing together this culture while putting it into a perspective of a young boy.
Later, when fate and determination takes him to the Land of the Dead, he was taken on an adventure to find his true family history, and what really happened with music and why his great-great grandmother hated it so with all her heart. He found out that his great-great grandfather was actually a man named Hector, and Miguel gets to dive deep into his family history and explore more about his actual lineage. Along with historical background through Día de Muertos, it's also a good representation of what a family is like, and how certain things like music can form a historical background.
Later in the movie, Miguel learned that his great-great grandfather was actually sabotaged, used and murdered by his idol, Ernesto de la Cruz. A creative twist to the movie, it displayed betrayal and a lot less of a happy narrative, compared to other typical Disney or Pixar movies. But with a sad moment in the plot, the climax was stronger and more meaningful.
The movie ended with a strong emphasis on family, and restoring ties within family, and within music. Miguel had worked out the issues in the real world and in the afterlife, and he was able to make music a strong part of his family heritage again. A very strong ending, there is a good message that anybody, and any age can learn from. Miguel's determination and fearless mindset shows how overcoming hardship takes time, realization, and strength. But in the end, he was successful.
Overall, the depiction of Coco is an accurate representation of the holiday Día de Muertos, and gives an in-depth story of the culture behind it, from music, to decorations, to practices, to bright and decorative colors, to spiritual beliefs. The practices seen in the movie are common in real life, and shows a sentimental celebration of those who have passed on into the afterlife. It's a family friendly movie, and shows real life situations, and how strong the characters in the movie were.",

928,17 November 2017,cwradio,9, So far the best international project in which they represent Mexican culture.,"The Day of the Dead is the traditional celebration in which Mexicans honor the deceased and is of Mesoamerican origin. There is an infinity of international projects that have tried to portray the Mexican culture, but in one way or another have failed miserably (some more than others), getting to see some in which we are represented even in a ridiculous and offensive . I must confess my fear that ""Coco"" would be part of this list, so I initially rejected the idea of ​​wasting money on the ticket; but once the fear has been overcome, I have been surprised to see that from the intro of Disney, to the credits, the Mexican culture is present. I do not know if by the controversy in which he was involved or by the collaboration of Lalo Alcaraz, but the magnificent work to which Pixar has accustomed us, was pleasantly surpassed, portraying in great detail not only the mysticism that surrounds the festivity, but also other elements that are truly part of our culture (family coexistence, music, costumes, beliefs, characters, etc.). The story of a Mexican boy named Miguel who wants to be like his musical idol (Ernesto de la Cruz) even against his family, takes him to meet Hector, who becomes his companion in adventures and with whom both Miguel and us We recognize many famous people, we discover the importance of the family and the values ​​that identify us as people and as a nation. Although in general terms the film is worthy of being recommended for the whole family, I must clarify that some situations and ideas represented are not characteristic of that festival or have been incorporated in recent years and that the personality of some famous people has been significantly altered (I suppose with the purpose of giving a touch of comedy to the story), which is why I find it painful not to give an absolute 10. Now I understand when they qualified me with 9.9 and they told me that my work was for a 10 if not for a tiny detail, but in case the creators of Pixar read this review I will compensate them by telling our followers that if they have not gone to see it, Run to your favorite cinema! If they are Mexican they will be happy to see how they dignify our culture after so many grievances and if they are not Mexican, but want to know and understand Mexico (especially the Day of the Dead tradition) it is the most fun way to do it.",

933,23 April 2018,mcmahonla,10, Coco,"In Disney Pixar's movie, Coco one of the main cultural pieces that was represented was La Dia de los Muertos (day of the dead). The story in this movie took place on Dia de los Muertos which is normally on November 2nd in Mexico, but in America, the holiday starts on Wednesday, October 31st and ends on November 2nd. I believe that Coco had a great representation of this Hispanic holiday. According to Wikipedia.org, ""The multi-day holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died, and help support their spiritual journey....traditions connected with the holiday include building private altars called ofrendas, honoring the deceased using calaveras, aztec marigolds, and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts."" In the movie, the family had a very well represented ofrenda to honor their passed relatives. They set out food, candles and pictures of their relatives which is very accurate to a real Ofrenda. 
Google Arts and Culture states, ""It is a day to honor and commemorate the lives of the dearly departed and to welcome the return of their spirits"". This holiday is basically celebrating the lives of past relatives, but some homes believe the spirits come back to us and walk among us at night so they can see their family. In Coco, there was a bridge of leaves that allowed the deceased ancestors to walk into the living world and visit their family, but before then they had to go through a security checkpoint to make sure their picture was put up or else they would not be able to cross. Not all families believe the same thing but they're all around the same traditional holiday.
According to Culturegrams Database on Mexican holidays, ""Each town also has an annual festival that includes a religious ceremony, meal, and dance. Many people try to return home for these events."" This is describing how important and relevant holidays are in Mexico including Dia de los Muertos. In Coco, the town that Miguel and his family live in there was a huge festival going on celebrating this holiday. They even had a talent show where anyone could sign up and play music. 
 I believe that Coco is very accurate to this holiday and traditions they represented in the film. The only aspect that is not one hundred percent correct in Coco was how the little boy went into the world where he could talk to the dead. Not because this isn't culturally accurate, but because it is just fiction. A lot of pieces in this movie were more about building a story in fiction mostly to catch the eye of the watchers. 
Coco was very accurate in cultural representation (despite the parts of building a story as I mentioned above), not only were so many aspects in the movie relatable to people of the hispanic culture, but they were also extremely enjoyable. Overall Coco is a great cultural introducing, family and heart touching movie.",

This is the best cartoon I've watched in the last few years! Yes, there have been good cartoons in recent years, but I have not experienced such kind, joyful and vivid emotions from watching for a long time. In my understanding, they were able to very organically combine a bright and really beautiful picture for children with a good story and at the same time spice up adults, but not vulgar humor, more or less modern history, and also fit here an excellent message about the value of the family, traditions and talk about such a wonderful Mexican a holiday of remembrance like 'Day of the Dead'. Personally, I had no idea that there was such a day at all, and what it personifies was even more unknown to me. During the viewing, I managed to sincerely and heartily laugh, cry, worry a little, even speculate and grumble under my breath laudatory words addressed to the creators for such a wonderful cartoon! And at the end, I literally said very loudly: 'Well, what an awesome cartoon! Just super! I want to rewatch it already ... 'I'm not a special fan of cartoons at all, more on TV shows and films, because cool and really interesting cartoons for both adults and children, just count on the fingers ... But here it was very interesting and exciting watch both me, a 33-year-old girl, and my little brother, 6 years old. And with a clear conscience I will recommend this cartoon to the children of all my friends, because I did not notice any specific excesses or a state of ""on the verge"" between children and adults here. The picture is not just bright, it is colorful, but not colorful, beautiful, but not too vanilla. It's amazing how the creators were able to keep a balance in all aspects that I pay attention to when watching: the big picture, music, child/adult, message, cognition, positive key. For me personally, this is a masterpiece, which I will review many times and unequivocally recommend to all my friends and strangers. 10 of 10.",

I remembered the hype when this came out and how strong of reviews/ratings were on IMDB. I'm not going to go deep into the story, but I will say I enjoyed myself and it is certainly worth the watch. The music is very good!...but the story is pretty basic. Some twists, some comedy, something about family values, you know a modern Disney movie; it's nothing ground breaking. This is more in line with Brave than Up or Wall-E in terms of Pixar movies. Again, I did enjoy the movie, but the don't pay attention to the overly positive reviews, unless you really enjoy the family matters moral; which to be fair, I'm not a big fan of.

In the first few minutes of watching the movie, I already fell in love with the film. It was so interesting that I just wanted to watch and watch and not look at anything else till the movie ends. And the movie's ending was simply amazing, so sad, yet so cheerful and sweet.
Thank you to the friend who said I should watch it :)
