0,17 December 2013,gogoschka-1,10, In one word: perfection,"Needs to be seen to be believed; in one word: perfection. Every frame, every voice-over, every song - it all comes together at the exact right moment to create the perfect film experience. This film makes you really understand and feel what makes the American mafia so compelling; in the eyes of a kid, who was unfortunate enough to grow up in a tough neighborhood, those gangsters are rock stars. Live fast, die young - but when you die, it ain't gonna be of a glamorous suicide or drug overdose - the ending will be brutal, ugly and sad. And it may very well be one of your best friends that will blow your brains out.",/

2,18 November 2009,AlsExGal,10, The best mobster film ever made,"After you see this movie, all other mobster movies you see or ever have seen will seem like garbage. They and their cast of characters will all appear cartoonish in comparison. Of course, this is a movie about the mafia from the working man/gangster point of view, where ""The Godfather"" was a mafia movie filmed from the viewpoint of the executive suite, so there really is no valid comparison there. ""Goodfellas"" really does seem ahead of its time when you realize that the only artistic work about the mafia that compares to it in quality is the HBO series ""The Sopranos"", which debuted nine years after this movie was made.",e
3,9 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, A great director at the peak of his talents,"It is hard to describe the brilliance that is Goodfellas. As good as Raging Bull and Taxi Driver are, I think Goodfellas is Martin Scorsese's best film and is a textbook example of a great director at the peak of his talents. The film crackles with raw energy and enthusiasm, the film is superbly directed and the final sequence is nothing short of stunning. The script is also excellent with memorable quotes, the story is never less than compelling and the pop and rock soundtrack is winning. The cinematography and detail is immaculate, and the ensemble cast is one of film's finest. Joe Pesci won an Oscar for his performance, and as good as he was, he is perfectly matched by Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta. All in all, it is a brilliant film and an instant classic no matter what time, day, week or year. 10/10 Bethany Cox",v

5,11 April 2005,OriginalMovieBuff21,10, The greatest mob film still today,"Amazing is the one and only word to say for this film. I have always thought that Goodfellas was one of the greatest films ever made and set a landmark in the 90's or even in movie history. I bought Goodfellas last week and I got to watch the film a couple days ago. I really just couldn't lay my eyes off the film and everything about it was just simply worth watching. The acting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were 100% accurate. The camera-work also was brilliant and Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job by putting excellent camera shots in his films and I give him high credit for that. The soundtrack too is one of the best soundtracks ever made and the song ""Layla,"" put chills down my spine of how great this song fitted the film. Overall, Martin Scorsese made his best film in my opinion and him and Nicholas Pileggi made an excellent and sharp script that made this, the greatest mob film still today.",e
6,10 March 2022,whoisfishmooney,10, Iconic,One of the most iconic movies of the 90s. So many unforgettable moments in cinema history. Quotable lines throughout also. A fun film on a bit of a negative subject.,w
7,3 March 2022,alicetich,10, Aged like a fine wine,This film was released 32 years ago but still looks as good now as it did then. Great seeing the famous heist on the airport given mainstream light as it was a huge crime back all those years ago.,/

9,15 February 2007,bkoganbing,9, The Criminal Mindset,"The gangster film has been redefined so many times in cinema history it will be interesting to see how it is redefined once again. Goodfellas is a milestone film in that regard because just as Public Enemy and Little Caesar defined it in the Thirties, The Godfather trilogy in the seventies and eighties, Goodfellas set the standard that all other films including Martin Scorsese similar Casino try to meet. The interesting thing is that Martin Scorsese is young enough to redefine it again with another work.",w
10,25 April 2020,muamba_eats_toast,8, Slightly disappointed but still very good,Having never seen it before but heard so much about it I was expecting it to be one of the best films I've ever seen instead it was just very good in my eyes. Potentially it has lost some originality by so many other films copying features of it that it just didn't seem new anymore but whilst nothing was wrong with it and like I said it was very good with some fantastic performances it just didn't stand out against so many others of this genre for me.,0
11,29 May 2007,Robert_duder,6, As good as those fellas are...I just don't get it,"I have nothing against gangster films and I love Deniro, and Liotta and Pesci...in moderation...The Godfather were brilliant films and I finally made my way around to seeing the infamously talked about 'Goodfellas.' I don't get it. I'll take the heat from any fans and I know there are scores of them...Goodfellas was average at best and simply a trashy look at a mobster from childhood to his end in the mob with some decent but over the top performance, brutally gratuitous language and violence. I suppose in some circles that equivalents to a great film but I need far more. I mean even the story has little depth to it and it's more or less an extended episode of The Sopranos without the character depth. I suppose after having the film hyped for years and hearing about the 'classic' I had high expectations but for me it was run of the mill, annoyingly loud and abrasive but with some good direction. Scorsese knows how to make an epic from beginning to end starting the film in the 50's and 60's and taking it all the way to the mid 80's is a challenge and he does it flawlessly. The gritty underworld, the dark lighting, the facial expressions all very good but put to a pointless story and sub par characters unfortunately.",2
12,16 September 1999,baumer,10, Scorsese's best,"Goodfellas makes you feel like you are watching guys that you know or knew. To this day, I have a friend that still talks like Jimmy Two Times. He always says things like ""Nice Nice"" and that was just a background piece in Goodfellas. But that is the point, all that is background is just as important as the main players and locales. It all paints us a perfect picture of what mob life must be like. And with all due kudos to The Godfather, but there is no other film that has ever made mob life look so real and feel so tangible the way Goodfellas does.",8
13,29 May 2022,Critic_For_Life,10, Watching Goodfellas- lost count of how many times to watch,"Goodfellas is a gem, never get tired watching it and it's very fun to watch. One of the best Scorcese films along with Casino ( I know there are other films). Love all the characters and Liotta stands out (RIP) - my absolute favorite scene is when he's joking around with Pesci and tells him he's a funny guy; I read that that scene was improvised. Will miss you Ray Liotta - not your time to leave us.",2
14,29 March 2005,shanfloyd,8, A classic mobster film.,"This is one hell of a film about the mobsters, based on a true story and coming from one of the great directors of all time. This is about Henry Hill, the narrator of the story, an Irish simple person who gets involved with the Mafia at a very young age and continues his life through it. There is no major plot in this film, just isolated incidents one of which was the turning point of Hill's life. Scorsese, as brilliant as he ever was, shows violence, sex and drugs etc in his own trademark style. And his actors helps him to make this film one of the classics.",3

16,24 July 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, Scorsese's masterpiece stands the test of time,"Martin Scorsese's unflinching portrayal of life in the mafia is a rightly acclaimed epic, at times funny, depressing but most of all frightening, all the more so because it's based on a true story. Basically it's the story of Ray Liotta's character's rise and fall in the mafia, and the way his relationships change with the various figures there as times come and go.",4

18,24 April 2012,mnpollio,7," Slick, flashy, often brilliant, yet cannot make you give a hoot about its characters","Goodfellas is a technically impressive film and interesting to review largely because of the huge following it has amongst film critics and Martin Scorsese fanatics alike, most of whom reverentially believe it is his best workand they may be correct.",?
19,27 May 2022,steiner-sam,8," The characters don't have the depth of those in ""The Godfather.""","It's a gangster biopic covering 25 years of gangster Henry Hill's life.

20,19 March 2022,doolanfile,10, Other mafia films struggle to hit same heights,Trouble with goodfellas is it sets the bar so high for mafia organised crime style movie. Outside of godfather and scarface this is the holy grail in its genre.,e
21,13 September 2000,thomashamps,9, A true classic,"This is the gangster film at its finest. Scorsese is on top form as are Pesci and De Niro. Liotta has never bettered the performance he gives here. The film starts as it means to go on - violent, full of profanity, fast paced and very stylish. The story follows Liotta's character from boy to man as he climbs his way up through the ranks of organised crime. We see all the highs and lows of his life and meet a host of very believable and very undesirable characters along the way. It's a film full of memorable scenes whilst remaining much more than the sum of its individual parts at the same time. This is what all movies should be like. It draws you in and won't let you out of its grasp at any point. When it finishes you feel exhausted and exhilarated at the same time. If ever the word 'masterpiece' was meant to be used, it was for this film.",f
22,3 September 2011,classicsoncall,9," ""The way I saw it, everybody takes a beating sometime"".","The first time I saw ""Goodfellas"", I didn't realize it was based on the Nichlas Pileggi book 'Wiseguy'. A lot of stuff seemed so familiar, and of course, the name Henry Hill was the tip-off, a non-Italian in the world of Mafioso high rollers and hit men. I read the book shortly after it came out, and the movie seemed to come out very quickly after. I don't remember a whole lot about the book now, but some of the things that stand out are the Air France job, the Lufthansa heist, and that bit about feeding a guy to a lion. Oh yeah, and the burial, exhumation and reburial of Billy Batts. You have to admit, ""Goodfellas"" has the best ba-da-bing opening of all time when Tommy (Joe Pesci) goes berserk on Batts in the car trunk and just keeps wailing.",_
23,18 March 2022,orangeblackwhite,10, Great lark,Great look into the Italian American culture and crime lifestyle of America. The filmmakers don't try and make the lifestyle look appealing but certain aspects actually do look good apart from hanging dead in a frozen meat van.,=
24,27 May 2022,handprime,10, The pinnicle,This is my absolute favorite movie. Watched it so many times. I seen Ray Liotta died yesterday and watched it again out of respect. This movie is what other movies hope with no faith to be measured against.,t
25,9 May 2023,Mymoviediscography,10, A Masterclass in Gangster Films,"Goodfellas is a classic gangster film that deserves every bit of its iconic status. Martin Scorsese brings his signature style to the story of Henry Hill, a mobster who rises through the ranks of the Italian-American mafia. The film is a true masterpiece of storytelling, with Scorsese's expert direction, brilliant editing, and an outstanding ensemble cast led by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci.",t

I enjoy it, too. I say ""sad"" because it's a sick film in many ways. Also, when you have 240-plus f-words in a movie, I mean, come on! In that respect alone, I'm embarrassed to say this movie is part of my collection. That's simply because it's a fascinating story, for the full 145 minutes.",u
28,29 December 2013,SnoopyStyle,10, This is an American Classic,Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) worked for Italian mobsters as a kid. He would climb the ladder as he becomes a big time gangster with his friends Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and James Conway (Robert De Niro). Director Martin Scorsese brings the Nicholas Pileggi book 'Wiseguy' alive.,r
29,30 April 2010,Hitchcoc,10, A Real Portrayal of All That Is Bad,"I generally back away from gangster films. It's not my favorite genre. I have trouble with the aggrandizement of this amoral subcult. This, however, is a masterpiece. It's almost documentary in its portrayal of this society of evil. Martin Scorsese has assembled the cream of the crop of actors who have cut their teeth on the successors of the Godfather. I can't begin to do justice to all the actors in this film. What I can attest to is the danger that lurks in every scene. In one scene the hard wired character played by Joe Pesci (marvelous and crazy) shoot a guy named ""Spider"" for not getting him the right drink. The rest of the men must sit there, without compassion, because this is a normal day, with ""normal"" events. There is also the second group. The wives and the families who are stuck in the middle of all this, pretending their husbands work nine-to-five jobs, while they are out hitting people. Ultimately, there is Robert de Niro who is the craziest of all. Played with subtle control, he dominates every scene. This is a true masterpiece that's hard to watch.",v
30,30 September 2006,Flagrant-Baronessa,8," Graphic and glorious, just in need of condensation","Exploring the rise and fall of a gangster, Goodfellas dawdles on Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) from his childhood when he first started as an errand boy for the local mob on across the street, to the height of his life when he unexpectedly has to make a decision that changes his life. By this time Henry is so entangled in the mafia that it has become his whole social life  from his friends, his wife, his job to his values  he is consumed in a camaraderie. The film is based on a true story and given its content and realistic photography approach, it feels strangely like a documentary. Director Martin Scorsese, who grew up on the gritty crime-infested streets of New York said: ""I remember seeing it on the streets and thinking, this is the way a movie should look like."" ",
31,19 May 2006,moonspinner55,6," Wiseguy mayhem, an artistic triumph but occasionally off-putting","Martin Scorsese-directed modern-day mobster drama adapted from Nicholas Pileggi's book ""Wiseguy"" by Scorsese and Pileggi involves Brooklyn youth in 1955 who gets drawn into the gangster lifestyle, first as their gopher, later as a major player. Joe Pesci is frightening as a psychotic ball-buster and won a Supporting Actor Oscar, yet Ray Liotta is even better in the central role, and Lorraine Bracco is excellent as Liotta's wife. Exceptionally well-made film is gratuitous in its usage of a certain expletive and cannot overcome one major obstacle: despite its attempts to show the ugliness of Mafia life, the movie is constantly undermined by a distinct romanticism of its own violence. The infrequent narration by both Liotta and Bracco is a distraction, as we are often being told exactly what we're seeing on the screen, but the creeping paranoia is palpable and the drama played out is disturbing and gripping. **1/2 from ****",
32,20 October 2015,Bevan - #4,5, Just plain overrated,"Chalk me up as another reviewer who found this movie to be vastly overrated. My wife and I saw it a couple nights ago, for the first time, and it just pales in comparison to cinematic triumphs such as The Godfather movies or The Sopranos.",
33,25 November 2005,FilmSnobby,3, May I differ?,"Overrated in 1990, *Goodfellas* has grown even more overrated with the passage of 15 years. It's based on the -- I daresay -- untrustworthy recollections of a half-Irish, half-Sicilian mobster-turned-informant who recently, I am reliably informed, appears as an addled, half-witted guest on ""The Howard Stern Show"". The narrative arc, if one can accurately term it that, spans 30 years, roughly from 1950 to 1980. This, of course, gives Martin Scorsese every incentive to soak the background with dozens of pop-culture tunes ranging from Bobby Vinton to Derek and the Dominoes. His use of the last 3 lilting minutes of ""Layla"" as some sort of ironic counterpoint in the extended montage that reveals the corpses of a dozen gruesomely executed mobsters in various places across New York City only underscores his utterly conventional taste in music. One wonders whether Scorsese would've been happier as a Top 40 deejay instead of a filmmaker.",
34,30 March 2020,alexdanford,8," Superb on the surface, but missing depth.","Having heard lots about this film and many people describe this as one of the greatest films ever, I went in with high hopes. Two and a half hours later, I would say although I enjoyed it, I was expecting more. I guess this film, much like Martin Scorsese's also largely successful Wolf of Wall Street, just felt too linear. Slickly filmed, with a variety of film techniques such as the freeze-frames and narration. A wonderful cast full of amazing performances, most of all by Joe Pesci playing Tommy DeVitto. Incredible. Despite all this, it still felt like something was missing. Understandably this and WoWS are both based on true stories so they aren't blessed with the capability to add the twists and turns of a fictitious story, but it just felt that the movie went on, and on, until eventually it was over; without really too much of significance happening. We knew there would be shootings and deaths, this is a gangster film afterall, but any problem encountered was dealt with so easily that it no longer seemed a problem to begin with. Even in the final sequences where the main character had such a big decision to make, turning on his lifelong friends, somehow I barely felt anything. Perhaps another director could have squeezed more emotion out of those scenes and then, for me, this could be further up there, with the greatest films of all time that many have described this as. Nevertheless, 8/10 for me, a magnificent film on the surface but seriously lacking any depth.",
35,24 May 2020,kosmasp,10, Bad Fellas,"I re-watched this right before I watched the Irishman, kind of made this a double bill. And while I was aware of how great this is, it is always worth revisiting. What a great movie (based on true events and characters - not a bad thing) this is! Awesome performances all around and a story that is quite engaging. Crime does not pay in the end ... could be one of the messages.",
36,8 March 2022,darwinlovesprice,10, Pow right in the kisser,This film gets you by the balls and you better strap yourself in for a thrill ride in mafia culture Italian style. 10 out of 10 rating from me full marks movie.,
37,18 February 2008,emperor_bender,10, Another version of the Godfather? No! Great movie? Yes!,"This movie was an instant classic to me. From the second I pressed Play, I knew it was going to be great. And it was. A lot of people bash this movie for being a knockoff of ""The Godfather"", but it is in no way a knockoff. This movie is based off a true story first off. Also, there's no ""mafia"" or ""families"" really to speak of. And a majority of the characters are Irish, not Italian. I liked all the different characters involved, the wiseguys, the losers, the brutes, the smart AND dumb people, you name it. The fighting/shooting/heist scenes were perfectly executed (no pun intended). Ray Liotta is great as Henry Hill, he explains everything so well and makes ""the life"" look great. Robert DeNiro really proved himself once again in the part of Jimmy Conway. And Joe Pesci was perfect to play Tommy DeVito. All the supporting/side characters were great as well. I give this a 10/10, which I don't do very often but this movie deserves it.",
38,13 June 2006,michael_the_nermal,4, Shallow Ultraviolence and Slimy Characters. Overrated Movie,"I suppose a lot of people found the characters in this film compelling and relatable on a basic human level. From what I saw, virtually all of the characters are low kinds of scum, always willing to betray one another and murder for kicks. The protagonist, played by Ray Liota, lacks the depth or redeeming characteristics that Cagney and Al Pacino's gangsters had. Liota's Henry Hill has very little that would make him seem like somebody to care about, because he's always willing to betray people and lie to save his own skin. When he gets his comeuppance, the viewer knows he richly deserves it, and will find no reason to take his side. His colleagues in crime, played by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, are equally irredeemable. The only decent qualities about De Niro and Liota is that they are not quick to condone random murder, as Pesci is always apt to do. The level of violence in this movie is gratuitous and disgusting. It does little to glamorize the life of crooks, and instead makes it seem like a low, loathsome venture.",

40,1 April 2008,TheEmulator23,10, A perfect film.,"This has everything a movie should have. A great story, acting, cinematography, direction, (I will never understand how Scorsese did not win his 1st Oscar!) production values, I can go on and on. There is nothing that isn't done perfectly on this film. If this were to come out in any given year it would be considered a classic. I understand that there are the hardcore devotee's to The 1st two Godfather films, but to me (and many others) this is the quintessential gangster film. I used to watch this film over and over and I usually try and nitpick even some of of the all time great films, but there is nothing I can pick on in this film! I had kind of seen Scorsese films before and really liked most of them, (Taxi Driver, & Raging Bull especially) but ever since ""Goodfellas"" I would follow everything he did. I didn't follow the Oscars when I was a kid, but was shocked to learn this didn't win Best Picture however the fact that ""Dances with Wolves"" did was one of the few times I wish the Oscar should could have been shared. As much as I loved ""Wolves"" ""Goodfellas"" has held up as the better picture. If you haven't seen this film and consider your self a serious film afectiando you need to see this before you are laughed at by actual filmphiles.",

42,27 May 2002,johnnymonsarrat,4, Jon Monsarrat review: too arty & violent,"I admit it; I'm an action movie guy. So a film about the mafia should be right up my alley.

But personally, I lack the sophistication or training to appreciate the makeup or sets or choreography if the plot is awful and the characters unlikeable.",
43,4 August 2005,seventhsamurai1954,10, The Ultimate Gangster Film,"Goodfellas is the type of movie that has it all. Action, thriller, suspense and even some comedy thrown in makes this epic film the best of it's kind. The pace of this film is brilliant. There is no dull scene, no fillers and it leaves you completely entertained from start to finish. Joe Pesci is absolutely amazing and deserved the Oscar no question. You don't even have to be a person that likes gangster films to appreciate Goodfellas. If you were one of the people that found The Godfather to be a little slow or boring at times, I highly recommend this film as a substitute ""mafia"" film. You will definitely get your money's worth if you rent this one. Best film of the 90's without a doubt.",

62,1 April 2015,crendine,7," ""Good But Not Great"" Fellas","I realize that in many circles, this film is considered an absolute classic and possibly Scorsese's greatest. However, over the course of time, my perception of this film has changed. Having read ""Wiseguy"" by Nicholas Pileggi, I realized that this movie does not conform to the book all that much and tends to stray a great deal. While most of the performances are memorable, they don't really resemble the actual characters that the story is based on. Joe Pesci's performance seems way over the top to me although certain short scenes of his are hilarious. Overall, I'd say his performance was overacted. DeNiro, Frank Vincent, Lorraine Bracco, and Ray Liotta turn in very convincing performances and Scorsese's approach to this film was very unique and well done. One of the many overlooked features of this movie is the soundtrack. While not quite chronologically correct in some spots, it does tend to emphasize certain scenes. My major criticism of this film is that way too much time in the second half is devoted to Henry's drug problem. I felt that this segment of his life could have been summed up in one or possibly two scenes. But here, almost the entire second half of this movie focuses on Henry's drug addiction and dealing. Not necessary. Another criticism is that the famous ""Lufthansa heist"" is only mentioned here and not shown at all. I believe that this, above all, was the centerpiece in the lives of Jimmy Burke and Henry Hill and is not given enough attention. I would have preferred to see more detail about the heist and less about Henry's drug use. Other than that, it's a memorable film and worthy of a few viewings. But as an all-time classic, I don't think so.",

The storyline follows a group of friends who work together and quickly work their way up the organized crime ladder. As they grow it quickly becomes hard to identify who can trust who versus who is working for their own personal interest. This confusion can cause problems for business. This movie is directed by Martin Scorsese (Casino) and stars Ray Liotta (Blow), Robert De Niro (Raging Bull), Joe Pesci (Lethal Weapon 2), Paul Sorvino (Nixon) and Lorraine Bracco (The Basketball Diaries). The depth by which this storyline is delivered is absolutely amazing. The details around every character, the nature of the business, the writing and dialogue lead to a rollercoaster of emotions as the film unfolds. You really get wrapped up and rooting interest in the characters. The acting is absolutely phenomenal by every character and the film locations are perfectly selected (I've actually visited a couple). The soundtrack is also very good.

82,4 May 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8, Filmed with a ferocious verve and cinematic yet fly-on-the-wall feel.,"While an argument could be made that 'Goodfellas (1990)' perhaps comes dangerously close to glamourising the gangster lifestyle it portrays, this sprawling and relentless picture depicts three-decades of mob life through the eyes of a real-life ex-mafioso who entered into the witness protection program in the early 1980s and ultimately manages to maintain an impartial stance by simply portraying all the events the way they are remembered to have occurred. Our protagonist also never actually kills anyone and his desperate, drug-fuelled downfall is just as detailed as his seduced start. Scorsese directs the piece with a real ferocious verve and the improvised dialogue lends a genuinely unpredictable edge to most sequences, leading to an almost fly-on-the-wall feel even though the techniques used are inherently cinematic. When the violence explodes onto the screen, it is just as shocking as you'd expect it to be.

Not this film, which shows America's finest filmmaker at the peak of his form. No finer film has ever been made about organized crime - not even ""The Godfather,"" although the two works are not really comparable. GoodFellas,"" scheduled to open Sept. 21 in Chicago, is a memoir of life in the Mafia, narrated in the first person by Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), an Irish-Italian kid whose only ambition, from his earliest teens, was to be a ""wise guy,"" a Mafioso. There is also narration by Karen, the Jewish girl (Lorraine Bracco) who married him, and who discovered that her entire social life was suddenly inside the Mafia; mob wives never went anywhere or talked to anyone who was not part of that world, and eventually, she says, the values of the Mafia came to seem like normal values. She was even proud of her husband for not lying around the house all day, for having the energy and daring to go out and steal for a living. There is a real Henry Hill, who disappeared into the anonymity of the federal government's witness protection program, and who over a period of four years told everything he knew about the mob to the reporter Nicholas Pileggi, whose Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family was a best-seller. ""GoodFellas"" is about guilt more than anything else. But it is not a straightforward morality play, in which good is established and guilt is the appropriate reaction toward evil. No, the hero of this film feels guilty for not upholding the Mafia code - guilty of the sin of betrayal. And his punishment is banishment, into the witness protection program, where nobody has a name and the headwaiter certainly doesn't know it.",

My biggest flaw with the film is the pacing, specifically towards the end, where it seems to be dragging on and overstuffed all at once. I feel in total the film could have been about 10 minutes shorter, but besides its lack in a very satisfying conclusion, the film can be very entertaining. For a film to be nearly 2 and a half hours long, it seems nearly impossible to be as entertaining as it often is. The writing, dialogue, and narration throughout is sharp and very intelligent, and the performances are pure gold- Joe Pesci especially. Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, and Lorraine Bracco also provide some very good performances, as well as the rest of the supporting and main cast. The cinematography is excellent, with some truly inventive and fun shots to follow, that simply make the film more enjoyable and endlessly watchable. The soundtrack is also great, as well as the atmosphere it provides for the film, and you will be sure to have a joy watching the film and its many parts at the very least some of the time. In the end, Goodfellas has its slower moments, but more often than not, Scorsese has made a brilliant crime film with some great performances, and lines that will be remembered for years to come.

125,14 December 2020,Jackblyth8,9, Special - Sacred - Scorsese,"Life in the mafia as a gangster brings the thought of risk of losing all you own but for many, offers an attractive lifestyle entailing a bundle of all the wants in the world. Scorses's film, lasting for 148 minutes, was set to be named 'wise guy' but changed in the last minute to 'goodfellas' and in an interview Joe Pesci admitted to the director given the actors freedom to improvise, making scenes more realistic and fluent. We begin in 1955, Brooklyn and meet Henry Hill, a young man who has had his eyes on the mafia lifestyle for a long time, he joins the life as a bandit working downtown. Henry works for local capo-regime Paul Cicero and James ""Jimmy the Gent"" Conway, performed by Robert De Niro, along with fellow gangster Tommy De Vito, perceived by Joe Pesci. Henry is a very slick, polished looking man, who's nature and look screams confidence, he is extremely assertive but not afraid to get his hands dirty, which appeals to the likes of James and Tommy. Moving to 1960, Henry is embroiled into the nightclub scenery, he is mainly plotted in the 'Copacabana' and dates Karen Friedman a Jewish woman, she, at first is worried and concerned about Henry's criminal activity but is seduced by his glamorous lifestyle and displaying masculinity. Karen is certainly taken on a journey throughout the watch and experiences life as a mistress to a thug, struggling with the difficulties and mental strains it includes. Despite Karen's parents disapproval she marries Henry and the pair have two children of their own. Now in 1970, Henry, Jimmy and Tommy are pictured at a bar, seeing Billy Batts a tough man recently released from prison, consecutively insults Tommy, aggravating Pesci's character, leading to Jimmy and Tommy murdering him. The three bury the body in Upstate New York, subtly thinking they got away with such a crime, Jimmy is informed six months later that that the burial site is slated for development - forcing the group to relocate the corpse. The three were certainly a variation of personalities, Jimmy was a reserved type with limited speech, only speaking when was completely necessary, but, when he had to we see him snap and show a brutal side to him which is hinted at in his lack of facial expressions. Tommy on the other hand is a bubbly character, the joker of the pack and seems to perform to whoever is in his company, but his dark side shines if any person dares to question him, punishing them through murder ruthlessly. Henry's other mistress Janice proves an obstacle for Karen and in 1974 we see Karen harass Janice and hold a gun directly at Henry threatening him to commit to his 'actual' family - Henry moved in with Janice despite advice from Paul to spend more time with his kids and Karen, explaining that he had collected a debt from a gambler in Tampa. The gambler's sister turned in Henry and Jimmy, with the pair being arrested due to the sister being an FBI typist. The pair received 10 years behind bars. This allowed Henry to consider his life choices and commitments and almost allowed him to calm down, he understood his obligation to provide for his family so when Karen visited, she smuggled drugs into the jail, for a Henry to sell to Pittsburgh inmates and return money to the family. Henry's release in 1978 enforced him to continue his drug business, expanding a cocaine commerce against Paul Cicero's orders, soon the business involved Tommy and Jimmy. Jimmy organised a raid focusing on the Lufthansa vault at JFK airport, stealing million of cash and jewellery, the initial plan was a success but the assembled squad didn't hide the getaway van and it was found by the police, Jimmy had everyone involved in the heist killed. Henry's voiceover, narrating inside information and truths about the story, states whilst showing a sequence of dead body's that Jimmy would've killed them anyway rather than share the profits. The line from the protagonist is soft-spoken and makes us question about Tommy, a man also involved in the raid. Tommy at this point beloved he was the 'made man' but was shot dead on his way to the ceremony in retribution for Batts' murder, significant it was on his way to a ceremony involving a man he murdered. Ray Liotta captures the stern masterpiece of what it takes to be a bandit, the smooth but scary characterisation shines throughout the film; his character in 1980 struggles from cocaine use and insomnia. Being out of control, Henry sets up a drug deal with his Pittsburgh associates, but the main character is too deep into his profession the police found out, jailing him for a second time. Karen, using the money from the business, bailed Henry out, but after being under pressure by the police's sudden arrival, she confesses to Henry that she flushed $60,000 worth of cocaine down the toilet, in an act to salvage her reputation and remain in custody of her children, this left the family virtually penniless. A combination of both physical and mental pain follow with Henry, who experiences pain and anger in the scene, knowing he may have lost it all. Henry meets Jimmy at a diner in town with talks of a proposed assignment - Henry is reluctant to begin with and realises that a Jimmy is set to have him and Karen killed. Henry's failure in the cocaine business and two arrests, not to mention his failure as a husband and father causes him to decide to become an Informant with his family in the Witness Protection program. Therefore, having Paulie and a jimmy arrested. Grateful to be alive, Henry is forced out of the gangster life and made to spend time with his family, readjusting to the real world. He narrates at the end of the watch that: "" I am an average nobody. I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook"". The end of titles informs us about unanswered questions, reporting that in 1990 (when the film was released) Henry is still a protected witness, but was arrested in Seattle 1987 for narcotics conspiracy and given 5 years probation - but clean since then. In 1989 He Roy separated from Karen after being married for 25 years. Paul ""Paulie"" Cicero died age 73 in prison from respiratory problems and finally, a Jimmy was still serving his 20 year life sentence in New York prison for murder, set to be paroled for 2004. He'd be 78 years old. The picture is a textbook Scorsese journey, following all aspects of life in the mafia - the insights of pain and anger it can cause, it also the included luxury it can carry. The film's message begs the question what is important in life; it isn't money and glamour, but family. And that the people who care for you and warrant that care to be reciprocated are important. Simply brilliant. The picture highlighted on the right from the iconic scene following Batts' murder, the casual stop at Tommy's mother and the three supplied with a late night meal to interrupt their 'business'.",

The amazing thing is that it's no fiction, even if it was, it's still beautiful. It's based on a book called Wiseguy written by Nicholas Pileggi. He met the real Henry Hill and made his story into a best selling book. Scorsese worked with Pileggi after liking the fast pace of the book, and they wrote the script. It was developed into this film. Casting is another great thing about the film, it seems that all the actors fit perfectly in their roles. It also has some really funny bits.

Having watched it, I have to ask what all the fuss is about? This is a very ordinary film which explores at extreme length the intimate details of the lives of the most childish individuals ever committed to celluloid. Whether or not people like these really exist, I found it completely uninteresting. I have no idea why so many people are fascinated by the mafia - maybe it's envy of the power - but they should not hold a fascination for civilised human beings. People who deal out death as a punishment for the slightest reverse in their lives deserve to be ignored or reprimanded, not lauded and celebrated as in this film. For every Henry Hill, there are a thousand or more kept in poverty because of the crime which supports his odious lifestyle. It would be nice to think there was some kind of a moral ending, but even then, we see Henry selling out his colleagues just to keep himself somewhere nearer the feeding trough.",

The story is interesting and well told, there's plenty of detail, but no overkill. The main characters all have a strong presence, at times they are likable, but don't be fooled.

The first two Godfather films and ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA had an epic, operatic sprawl to them, but GOODFELLAS was lean and muscular by comparison, despite being over two And a half hours in length.

Despite that, I remember enjoying the movie very much. Now that I've seen it uncensored and on HD DVD, it doesn't impress me as much as before perhaps because in jumping several years in various segments, you half wonder what happened during those in-between times. Still, Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Larraine Bracco impress with their performances with Paul Sorvino lending gravity with his appearances throughout and nice cameos by up-and-coming newcomers like Illeana Douglas, Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, and Michael Imperioli. Also amusing were cameos by the director's parents, Catherine and Charles, especially Catherine's as Pesci's mother. Pesci may be the most impressive of the bunch in his Oscar-winning role as Tommy who turns from highly amused to very angry at a dime. Perhaps not one for the mainstream crowd who wants at least one likable character to identify with but a mostly compelling account of the true story of what mob life really was like for someone who lived through it.",

I thought that the composition of the story of this movie and the atmosphere of the movie was very similar to Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.
Especially the first half hour. The camera moved very well, and it was difficult for the audience to get bored at the same time. The shooting is very admirable. Each picture is very beautiful. It was beautiful because it was a film. There is characteristic music everywhere. How to use how music is very wonderful. Inundation of music.
The camerawork, photography and music symphony attracted us. If you look at the other films of this director, the scripts are always never a masterpiece. We screenwriters shouldn't try to learn scripts from this director. However. Though, the minimum elements that do not get the customer bored are included in the script.
Overall of those is very similar to Tarantino's Once Upon A Time in Hollywood. I was surprised that the great movie had such a good example. And I think that the director's true greatness is to discover a new atmosphere like this movie.",

Well, just think about this, insulted by whom? by a wannabe big shot who thinks he's the king of the world simply because he doesn't need to stand in a queue, or can get the best table to his girlfriend in the restaurant? the genius of the script is that you're almost envying the protagonists in the beginning, the whole first act has a sort of joyful atmosphere where everything is fun, even when it's not.

156,19 January 2008,jintrieri,10, One the greatest movies ever,"Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is quintessentially one of the greatest movies ever. It is better than The Godfather in my opinion because of its real life approach to mob life. The film follows Henry Hill as he is brought into the mob life at a young age and how it brings him down at the end. The movie is just amazing to watch as it is like watching a documentary on the what is like to be in the mob. Adding to it are the amazing performances put forth by Ray Liotta as Henry,Robert De Niro as his friend Jimmy the Gent who is great in it and Lorraine Bracco who is very good as Henry's wife. But the performance worth mentioning is Joe Pesci's awesome performance as Tommy De Vito. His acting in it is one of the best performances I've ever seen. The film follows a time line from the 1950's to the 1980's and with it accompanies one of the greatest soundtracks ever put together.

Based on the true story of Henry Hill, he narrated the story of his life in crime almost unapologetically at times. Martin Scorsese was a genius in recreating the era with sounds, music, costumes. Too bad, the film lost best picture to ""Dances with Wolves."" Liotta's performance of Henry Hill was once in a lifetime for him. He played him beautifully. Robert DeNiro's Jimmy Conway also was brilliant as well. Joe Pesci deserved his Academy Award for playing Tommy DeVito. Mama Scorsese played Mother Devito in the movie. When the film credits rolled, the musical rendition of ""Layla,"" was just unforgettable and intertwined with the scenes of those dead bodies in the pink cadillac and frozen in the truck.

It shows the brutality and the extreme male chauvinism of these gangsters who are ready to sell anything, steal anything, kill anyone in order to make money, and as for killing, to satisfy their insatiable thirst for blood, to satisfy their unquenchable hunger for violence. It also shows, rather on the side because it is not the main object, how justice and before it the police are managing their gang-spirit, splitting their unity and getting the weaker ones to become protected witnesses, and it works: these criminals prefer being hidden away by the Justice Department for decades rather than going away in prison for even longer periods of time. The film is well done: Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci are quite acceptable. Ray Liotta on the other hand appears slightly weak when confronted to the other two, and he has to be since he is the side-kick, and an essential one at that, of both of them. One shortcoming though: even if the police managed to more or less bring the Italians back in line, the film is absolutely silent about the fact that the various traffics and particularly drugs were then abandoned to another mafia, probably even more dangerous, i.e. the Blacks and the Porto Ricans and other Latinos.",

There was no struggle with moral issues. These guys were just violent jerks for whom I had no sympathy. I *wanted* them to get caught so someone would get them off of the street (and off of my TV screen). Ray Liotta is such a pretty boy that he could never match DeNiro or Keitel in my book.

That he voice-overs his own life, later joined by his wife, narrating her side, is pivotal to the movie's ingenuity. Though the film refuses to judge its characters, it's not an omniscient portrayal, but a frame of reference rooted in yearning for the life. What's more, alternating dual narration causes us to see scenes in different ways. ""These were blue-collar guys,"" Hill's wife rationalizes. ""The only way they could make real extra money was to go out and cut a few corners."" Their influence was, and is, exhilarating. ""If we wanted something, we just took it,"" Henry says. ""If anyone complained twice they got hit so bad, believe me, they never complained again.""

De Niro was supported well to say the least with great performances by Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta and Paul Sorvino. Every time you watch this film you see something different and it reminds you that this film is a masterpiece.

This can perhaps best be described as a portrayal of the environment, showing good and bad alike. The glamorous nature of that way of life is put up on the screen, and you definitely understand its appeal. Scorsese doesn't fail us for a second of this. It is brutal, funny, charming, bloody, intense and entertaining. The writing is excellent. Narration as well as dialog are incredible and highly memorable and quotable. The plot is interesting and develops nicely. Strong storytelling is one of the things that keeps you watching. The characters and personalities is another. Cinematography and editing are top-notch. The scoring is spot-on, with every music piece being fantastic and fitting(directly or ironically) at the same time. Every single acting performance is perfect, not only Liotta, Pesci and of course DeNiro. The pacing is marvelous. Mood and atmosphere are established masterfully. The language doesn't hold back, neither in tone nor in amount. There is some sexuality, not terribly graphic. Violence is unrestrained. This has disturbing content. The DVD comes with four featurettes(coming to about an hour in running time, all put together), as well as two commentary tracks... ""Cast and Crew""(self-explanatory) and ""Cop and Crook""(the actual Henry, and one of the feds who worked against the mob). All of it is worth the time.

This is a thrill ride of Henry Hill's rise and fall. Greatest gangster movie of all time.",

Have you ever listened to a song compressed to an unreasonable size? This is what this film is. Crushed to a time of around of 72 minutes, this story could really use two. The truth is, this film doesn't convey anything. There's no central point or conflict. ""Pulp Fiction"", a much better film, pulled off the lack of a main central conflict, but without any characterization, or a sense of a real journey this film suffers the same fate as the boring ""Aviator"". The story of a real person with a lot of glitz and gloss galore in every seen but a severe lack of content. Every seen moves very fast and everything happens instaneously and they use a narrator to fill in the blanks of information they use narrators. Characterization dies and a quick and painless death in this pointless script. I'm pretty sure the book writer and writer of the script had a central conflict or point of the film in mind when they wrote it, however, it never comes out in the film. This movie is just bad.",

227,13 July 2003,WriterDave,10," The Myth of ""The Greatest Film of All Time"" Brought to Glorious Life","If you hate mob movies, or hate Scorsese, then you probably won't be able to sit through this. But for the rest of us out there, this is arguably one of the best films of the 1990's, possibly one of the best of all time, and without a doubt one of the most influential films of the past twenty years. Every mob movie/underworld saga/generational tale/crime thriller from ""Pulp Fiction"" to ""Boogie Nights"" to ""Blow"" (which played like the TV movie version of a great Scorsese flick) to TV's ""The Sopranos"" owes a debt to this film. Scorsese was at the top of his game here, and what makes this film stand tall above all other movies of this ilk (including Scorsese's own ""Casino""--a great film in its own right) is that there is an overwhelming visceral charge to the film that makes it all seem so enjoyable despite the onslaught of blood, foul language, and unsavory activities. You are made to believe that these gangsters were having the time of their lives. So too were Scorsese and pals in making the film. And lastly, so too are we the audience in watching it all. Everything came together in this film so perfectly the viewer is left feeling oddly giddy amongst all the true life bloodshed. This sense of ""fun"" is the one thing that his recent ""Gangs of New York"" was missing, and may be what keeps that film from being ranked as one of the all time greats.",

Films like ""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""The Crying Game"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Fargo"", and ""L.A. Confidential"" would have likely never been made as well as they were without the influence of Scorsese's ""GoodFellas"". The film is an intense study of a Mafia family over a 30-year stretch. Ray Liotta plays the half-Irish, half-Sicilian kid from Brooklyn whose only dream is to be a gangster. Although Liotta's story is at the heart of ""GoodFellas"", it is the supporting cast that is the film's calling card. Robert DeNiro gives one of his greatest performances, Paul Sorvino is quietly effective, and Lorraine Bracco (in an Oscar-nominated role) does the best work of her career. However, it is Joe Pesci (in his well-deserved Oscar-winning turn) who steals every scene as the one who does the ""dirty work"".

I really REALLY don't know why didn't it got an Oscar, but it's pity. Now 1 IDIOT user wrote ""why do people rate movies like this so high?"" The only thing i can say is: Dude, life is not only pink and furry, you have to look at the other side of life, the dark side. In this movie you will find a superb story of how was life back then, when the mobs ruled all. Violence is this guys problem... Dude, take a look around, and see for yourself. There is MUCH MUCH more violence nowadays then there was back then, sad but true.

EVERYTHING is falling apart, we eat junk food, have to ""wait in line"", quality of products drop, no good music...

Not only that, it is probably the best Scorsese film I have seen so far. The acting, the dialogues, the setting, everything in this film is brilliant. Anyone who watches this film is guaranteed to love it. The plot is based on a true story of a real life mobster Henry Hill. It follows his beginnings as a kid growing up in Brooklyn who eventually works for a crime family. The reason why he wants to work for a crime family, is because ""as far back as he can remember he always wanted to be a gangster."" Henry's life as a mobster forms the rest of the movie. Henry Hill is played by Ray Liotta, an actor that I wish to see more on the big screens. His portrayal of the real life gangster is as realistic as it gets. From the mannerisms to the speech delivery, it is almost like we are all thinking this is a real gangster. Robert De Niro plays Jimmy Gent, who takes Henry under his wing and in a way mentors him. The other guy Jimmy takes with him and who eventually works with Henry is Tommy DeVito, played by Joe Pesci. This to me is the best performance of the film. DeVito is a character with a short fuse and Pesci played the character to perfection. This film shows why he is one of the finest actors of his generation and why he won an Oscar for his role. To me, his performance is what you will think of when the movie is over. All in all this was a fantastic film and definitely one of the best mob movies ever.

I'm going to be the fly in the ointment and give it a 7, which still ain't bad. And it ain't - I mean isn't - bad at all, by any means. Nor, in my book, is it anywhere near great. Not by a long shot. It may be due, largely, although not sure yet, to Joe Pesci's one note characterization (way too typical of him). A little ""f"" word here and there never hurt nobody but goes just so far. It becomes not so much an aspect of his psychopathology but, with its over emphasis, weakens it, parodying what might be very legitimate. He was insane, and not a joke, but the character becomes jokey. How Ray Liotta did not get acknowledged for a much more realistic portrayal, and get at least a nomination for a part he brought dimensionality to, is a mystery. But, of course, the whole concept of an Academy Award is a mystery in and of itself. I mean, after all - Charlton Heston (in anything)?; Shirley Jones when you have Janet Leigh?; Rita Moreno opposite Judy Garland as well as Fay Bainter and Lotte Lenya?; not to mention the even more outrageous selection of Chakiris vs Clift and Geo. C. Scott?; Grace Kelly vs. Judy Garland????? Now, really! That one is going too far. And so on and forth. Give me Pesci in My Cousin Vinny anytime (not even a nomination). Aside from that - there were moments in the film that were clearly wonderful. Bracco and all the other molls getting their faces and nails done, scanning and re-scanning each of their thoughtless faces; the stop motion a dozen or more times capturing the characters silent, still; De Niro smiling at you with one of his 2 faces barely showing the 2nd face that will soon emerge and become the easy victor; the sense of confusion and then addiction that Liotta captures; the latter part where he describes in repetitive detail, in his drug-addled way, the order of the evening and transporting the pounds of cocaine to another city; dinner table with Mom and the 3 boys while the body in the trunk is writhing.

Soon enough the boss Paul 'Paulie' Cicero, based on Lucchese mobster Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino) lets him help his close associate James 'Jimmy' Conway (Robert De Niro) along with young Tommy DeVito (Oscar winning Joe Pesci). As they get older they have become the most well known and ruthless gangsters with billions of dollars of cargo passing through the airport, and many heists. Because Henry and Jimmy are both Irish they cannot become a ""made man"", but Tommy can. Henry's friends become increasingly daring and dangerous, with Jimmy hijacking trucks, and Tommy with an explosive temper and psychotic violent nature. Henry in the story also meets, falls for and marries Karen (Lorraine Bracco). There are many other things I could mention in the whole story, but that'll take ages, so I'll just say that Henry and Jimmy are caught and imprisoned at one point, Tommy murders ""made man"" Stacks Edwards (a very brief Samuel L. Jackson), and when he is made one is quite quickly murdered, and in the end of the film Henry drops his gangster identity and becomes a normal ""schmuck"". Also starring Frank Sivero as Frankie Carbone, Tony Darrow as Sonny Bunz, Dumb and Dumber's Mike Starr as Frenchy, Frank Vincent as Billy Batts, Chuck Low as Morris 'Morrie' Kessler, Catherine Scorsese (Martin's real mother) as Tommy's Mother, Frank DiLeo as Tuddy Cicero, comedian Henny Youngman as himself, Gina Mastrogiacomo as Janice Rossi, Charles Scorsese (Martin's real father) as Vinnie, Suzanne Shepherd as Karen's Mother, Debi Mazar as Sandy and Michael Imperioli as Spider. Pesci is the perfect and deserved Oscar winner for his brutal, psychotics and very convincing role, De Niro and Liotta are also very good in their roles, a very good film (seeing it again)! It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Robert De Niro number 2 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was also number 50 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 5 (along with Al Pacino) on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 55 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments for the brilliant scene where Pesci seems to be getting madder at Liotta saying ""How am I funny? (it's scary because you don't know where it's going, till Liotta realises it's a joke of course), and it was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!",
279,18 July 2020,TheHonestCritic,4," Is all of the hype and praising of this ""movie"" really warranted? I'll be the judge of that.","""Goodfellas"" (1990), honestly, why is this considered one of the best gangster films of all-time? It should really be called: ""Badfellas""! Don't get me wrong, I love gangster films and I was excited to watch this ""movie"" for the first time. But, at the end of the day, I was ultimately just disappointed with it overall. It has a very messy and convoluted storyline, mediocre to over the top acting, and a boring generic soundtrack. The storyline is basically just the realistic life of the mafia. It's based off the novel, ""Wiseguy"" by Nicholas Pileggi. One thing about this novel is that it's non-fiction. I'm not the biggest fan of non-fiction books or other media. However, ""Wiseguy"" is one of those non-fictional novels that I enjoy reading. I thought: ""this would make an interesting movie!"" Then, when I looked into it and discovered that ""Goodfellas"" was based on this novel it sparked my interest. The concept had great potential, and I saw that the screenplay was in fact written by Nicholas Pileggi himself. Then, I saw that Martin Scorsese joined in writing the screenplay and I thought: ""yeah, I understand it has to meet feature film standards. How much can Martin Scorsese possibly change with the story?"" I think that Martin Scorsese should have just left the screenplay writing duties to Nicholas Pileggi, because he completely screwed it up! The story would have probably been stronger if Martin Scorsese kept his hands off the screenplay and stuck to directing. Another thing, is the annoying and constant narration in the ""film"". Narration can be effective when utilized properly, but when it's overdone like in this ""movie"", it just becomes downright unbearable! Film Making 101: to have a stronger impact in your film, show, don't tell. If you're going to add in narration, make sure it aids in telling the story. In this ""film"", it's absolutely distracting from the story. What little there is! Such a crying shame, because the original concept would have made a great movie! There is one thing I'd like to point out, and it's something positive in this ""film"". For those who may not know, one thing I like to see in cinema is a good long single take. Of course, there are a few out there that aren't that great, or boring. But, the one in this ""movie"" is fantastic and one of the best single shots I've seen in any film. It's just about three minutes in length without any cuts whatsoever. The scene where Henry, played by Ray Liotta and Karen, played by Lorraine Braco make their way into the restaurant. That shot is so well laid out, and the final result was worth it. So, I will give the ""movie"" some extra credit for that, some, because long single shots can be very hard to nail. That, in my opinion, is the biggest highlight of this ""film"". As for the acting, it's overall just over the top, in the worst possible way. The best performances come from Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro. Ray Liotta was okay, but he just looked bored playing his role. As a result, I was bored watching him! The rest of the actors and actresses are nothing but mediocre. I don't understand, all of the major actors and actresses in this ""film"" give great performances in other films and shows. What's their excuse here? The soundtrack has a couple of memorable parts. But, for the most part it's just dull and therefore it makes the ""movie"" dull as well. Now for the positives, yes there are two positives in this ""film"", which are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great. You can't go wrong with filming your movie in an iconic city like New York. I may not enjoy visiting the city itself, but it's really entertaining to watch on movies and shows! The sets/locations give the ""film"" a great atmosphere. The only other positive is the special effects. All of the special effects were very well-done and still hold up to this day. ""Goodfellas"" is overall just a failure in the gangster genre. I don't care how praised a film is, I don't care how much money it makes and I don't care how many awards it wins. All of that means nothing! If I think a film is crap, then it's crap. This ""movie"" is no exception of that! I give it 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Stay away from ""Goodfellas"", or else you'll just end up being whacked with massive disappointment!",
280,30 January 2003,Derek237,10, Scorsese at his best,"Goodfellas is an all around great movie. If you don't immediately love it, it'll probably grow on you soon enough. Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco, and Joe Pesci all give the best performances in their careers and it is arguably Martin Scorsese's best directorial effort. Sure, it's up there among his best with Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, and Raging Bull, but this one just stands out more. I think what makes Goodfellas so great is it's compilation of elements like the acting, storytelling, character development, and dialogue. My One complaint is that Robert DeNiro is not in the movie as much as you'd expect, and I was always left wanting more. But maybe that's a good thing.",
281,27 April 2020,jackman-74739,8, Scorsese at the top of his game,"A Scorsese classic. It ticks all the boxes. Italians, gangsters, lots of fbombs, the lot. It's very well directed and the style changes throughout the film which compliments the narrative, e.g. romanticised and flowing at the beginning to jerky and unrhythmic at the end. The acting was also fantastic with everyone pretty much becoming a stereotype, especially joe Pesci. The script was tight as well, with a great twist at the ending. however I felt like his downfall cane a little too quickly and it ended quite abruptly. Other than that it made gangster life seem kinda appealing...

Based on the experiences of real-life ex-gangster Henry Hill, one-time associate of New York's Luchese crime family, the film gives an inside look at organized crime as it really is. Joe Pesci as the murderous Tommy DeVito absolutely steals the show. It is worth the price of the DVD just to see this talented and versatile performer in action. Ray Liotta gives a good performance as Henry Hill, but is overshadowed by Lorraine Bracco, who plays Henry's over-the-top wife Karen. Robert DeNiro's performance is so-so.

294,8 October 2009,zardoz-13,10, The Crime of Their Lives,"""Raging Bull"" director Martin Scorsese received his third Oscar nomination as Best Director for ""Goodfellas,"" starring Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci, an engrossing epic about life in the mafia based on Nicholas Pileggi's bestselling biography about real-life gangster Henry Hill. This blue collar crime saga differs from mafia melodramas like Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" because Scorsese refrains from either eavesdropping on the upper echelons of organized crime management or depicting the actual logistics involved in its major heist. In other words, scenes concerning the hierarchy of mob bosses convening to resolve rivalries among their families or scenes about the actual heist are never shown. Nevertheless, ""Goodfellas"" is violent, profane, and unrelenting in its R-rated portrayal of crime and punishment. Pesci won the Best Supporting Actor's Oscar, while ""Goodfellas"" received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Film Editing, and Best Screenplay based on material adapted from another medium. Incidentally, Kevin Costner's ""Dances with Wolves"" trumped ""Goodfellas"" for the Oscar.",

A depressing nasty movie where the main character continually does awful things, where the good characters are repeatedly punished while cruel horrible people are rewarded, wow so gritty and unrewarding to watch, overrated movie, overrated director, bad storyline. Who cares if it's true why even make this movie, I ended up just watching it for the murder scenes and even then saw a couple dead characters blink or breathe and take me out of it, and the more characters die the less the movie matters just gets to the point of like whatever kill them all who cares, just so overrated. Giving 3 stars for the production quality and acting but maybe these guys are just playing themselves maybe they're all nasty in real life, considering Deniro is mates with Marina Abramovic the self proclaimed dark witch it seems like this whole movie has more to it in reality.",

Beliveable, and directed in the manner of the author telling the story.  The art of story tell is a lost one with many the entertainment industry marketing for a public with  a short attenion span, but in the world of Jerry Springer, and professional wrestling, where the product is directed at a 2 second attention span this moive cuts down the quick fix mentaliy of our time. This is a well crafted film, which has a story told and unravels in proper fourm.  This is a nice break from factory made fourmulated moives where you can guess the script 10 minitues into the movie.

297,22 May 2002,Dark Eye,7," Pretty good, but overrated","Goodfellas is about a journey of an outsider who makes it good in the world of Italian mafia, and befriends two mobs for the remainder of his career. Much like Forrest Gump, its a story being told largely through one person' point of view. I conclude at the end that although the movie was exteremely enjoyable, its a bit overrated and it did not bear any lasting images in my psyche. There isn't a single aspect that strikes me as memorable or powerful. Thus it irritates me to no end that Goodfellas is constantly being compared to The Godfather, because I couldn't disagree more. What makes The Godfather so good is that its not really about gangsters running a business, but a deep look on family relationships and how their respective roles and personalities contribute to the family's successes and downfall. Goodfellas is only about three men working together, having the time of their lives, and occasionally punching and kicking their way through obstacles before things starts to fall apart at the end - nothing is out of the ordinary. The only message I get from the story is that becoming a gangster gives you power, but you must pay for that power dearly in exchange for absolute loyalty. Problem is, I've heard of this countless of times already.",

Liotta's fall is as rough as his rise is seductively entertaining (think SCARFACE, only a whole lot better) and it's punctuated by brutal acts of violence.",
299,4 May 2014,blanbrn,8," Martin's short and sweet real life mob film that shows crime life pays with excess, but in the end it all breaks!","Finally watched Martin Scorsese's classic crime drama thriller 1990's ""Goodfellas"" and I wasn't surprised I knew what to expect as Martin's films involve most of the time New York, crime, and the real tales of the mob underworld. The film is powerful with it's crime, drama and human emotion as blood and greed is spilled while racking up power and excess only as with most morality stories all of it comes crashing down in the end. The chemistry is fantastic with the all star cast of Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco and one of my favorites Joe Pesci. It tells the real life story of small time crook and criminal Henry Hill(Ray Liotta)who climbs up the ranks of the mob underworld after taking part in a big time robbery. And his partner in crime is the big boss James Conway(DeNiro)and thru it all it's a struggle with his trophy wife Karen(Lorraine Bracco)as despite the times of big money and diamonds Henry has a mistress on the side to drive Karen crazy! In a short and sweet note Joe Pesci hams it up as mobster sidekick Tommy Devito. Overall the film may be predictable still it showcases a real life mob drama in fine fashion showing that the life you live pays a bad price for you in the end.",

304,29 August 2009,sddavis63,8, A Portrait Of Mob Life,"The obvious comparison for this movie is, of course, ""The Godfather."" Looked at in that way, I thought ""Goodfellas"" was the superior movie - actually, not even close. Where some of the characters in ""The Godfather"" (especially Brando's Don Corleone) had an almost cartoonish aura around them, everyone in this movie seemed very real. There were no cartoonish elements to this, and no one in this movie was ever fated to be a caricature, in the way Brando as Corleone was. This was a down to earth, realistic story about life in the mob, shown mostly through the eyes of Henry (Ray Liotta), who, as an Irish Italian kid, glamorizes gangsters and gets involved with them as a kid, and then lives his life among them. Liotta was very good, as were all the main actors is this - Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco all did well with their respective parts, and you come away from this movie thinking that you have a feel for what it's like to live this life. As the movie comes to an end, and Henry becomes a snitch, testifying against some of his former ""buddies,"" you also get a dose of reality. These guys don't go to the cops out of any real change of heart or because they're suddenly stricken by a guilty conscience and decide to go straight. Henry suddenly realized he was in danger, and the only way to protect himself and his family was to testify. In the voice-over narration the point is well made that, even as he's testifying against these guys, he still envies them their lifestyle and enjoyed sharing it for a good number of years, and going straight is the price he has to pay for safety.",

306,23 June 2004,paul2001sw-1,8," Goodfellas, but not quite great","Martin Scorcese's compelling 'Goodfellas' is arguably his most entertaining film.  It's accomplishments include a strong but believable narrative, a loving recreation of two decades of New York life in music and images (including some famously stunning elongated tracking shots), and great performances, in particular from Joe Peschi as the psychopathic killer Tommy and Paul Sorvino as a mafia boss.  Yet its watchability is also its weakness.  Central character Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) narrates throughout, smoothing together the strands of the story but also telling us how to interpret it and thus distancing us from the action.  The film lacks the visceral intimacy of 'Raging Bull' (or, indeed, the subversiveness of 'Taxi Driver' or 'The King of Comedy'), while, for example, the emotional impact of the scenes where Henry realises the mob is out to kill him is slight compared with, say, the similar scenes concerning Al Pacino's character in 'Donnie Brasco'. It's almost impossible to dislike this film, because we are led through it so adeptly, but at a certain level, it's little more than a well-spun yarn, proof perhaps that a master reaches the height of his technical powers somewhat later than the peak of his imagination.  Enjoy it, but the early stuff is better.",

The movie had no substance. Nothing stood out about any of the characters, they all were just generically portrayed gangsters. The narration almost got in the way of interpreting the movie on my own terms, it felt like i was being spoon fed the story and not to mention the narration was stale and made the movie seem boring. After watching it im conflicted about what to take from it since it skimmed over everything, the heist that was supposed to be the focal point, turned out to be something that was almost forgettable until i realised that it actually happened in real life which made the movie all the more interesting knowing that these were true events but the movie played no part in portraying the severity. The movie was keen on glamourising the gangster lifestyle but failed to actually show it! All you get is the narration. In my opinion there's only so much you can do w a gangster movie but this was just plain textbook i mean you get the cool and clever lead and when stuff gets too real he's fallen under drug abuse, and although that might've been the reality, this is media portrayal which mainly for entertainment purposes so adding to the character development might have been the right move. The movie showcased the 50's till the 80's without any attention to detail, the music, the wardrobe, the cars etc it all seemed as if they didn't care much about it and the only thing that was important was the well-known cast and the runtime.

If ""The Godfather"" films, (well, parts 1 and 2 anyway), represent the greatest single achievement in the genre taken as a whole, ""Goodfellas"" is still probably the pinnacle of the old-fashioned gangster movie per se. It's based on fact, and by all accounts very accurately, but its genesis lies in the Warner Brothers films of the 1930's, (which, of course, were 'torn from the headlines', so to speak).",

Joe Pesci plays an excellent performance as Tommy the loose cannoned killer. Robert DeNiro plays the Jimmy and it remains one of the best performances of his life but the performance of the film for realism belongs to Ray Liotta as Henry, the kid who started in the mafia as a young child and morphed into a middle aged coke head. This film is through the eyes of him in the mob for three decades observing every death, deal and wise guy in the deck.

There is nothing that isn't done perfectly on this film. If this were to come out in any given year it would be considered a classic. I understand that there are the hardcore devotee's to The 1st two Godfat her films, but to me (and many others) this is the quintessential gangster film. I used to watch this film over and over and I usually try and nit pick even some of of the all time great films, but there is nothing I can pick on in this film! I had kind of seen Scorsese films before and really liked most of them, (Taxi Driver, & Raging Bull es pecially) but ever since ""Goodfellas"" I would follow everything he did. I didn't follow the Oscars when I was a kid, but was shocked to learn this didn't win Best Picture however the fact that ""Dances with Wolves"" did was one of the few times I wish the Oscar should could have been shared. As much as I loved ""Wolves"" ""Goodfellas"" has held up as the better picture. If you haven't seen this film and consider your self a serious film afectiando you need to see this before you are laughed at by actual filmphiles.",
321,26 November 2020,briancham1994,8, Better than The Godfather,"There, I said it. GoodFellas is better than The Godfather. The pace and excitement are a lot faster which makes it more engaging. They are similar in showing the gangster life as a mix of unpredictable violence and temporary glamour. However, GoodFellas focuses more on the perspective of one individual and how the lifestyle appealed to him as a child and onwards. The direction shows this perspective with great skill - there are many scenes imbued with great excitement, paranoia, fear and brutality. All of this adds up to a true to life depiction of what the American organised crime experience is like and how it ends.",
322,1 April 2020,pmtelefon,10, Terrific,"""Goodfellas"" is one of those movies that if I catch it on tv, I stop clicking around. Even though I've seen it a bunch of times, I stop searching the channels and I watch it again. I remember seeing this movie in the theater (Bayside, NY). The theater was filled with a few loud-mouths and they took some of the thrill away from the movie. I've seen ""Goodfellas"" a bunch of times since and it's one of the greats. It's not a perfect movie but it comes close. By the way, this movie is special to me because the scenes at Joe Pesci's mother's house were filmed on the block where I grew up (241 Street, Bellerose, Queens, NY).",
323,2 May 2008,kenjha,8," Good, Bad, and Ugly Fellas","This movie is about despicable characters committing deplorable acts yet it manages to be interesting if overlong, with too much time spent establishing the gangster lifestyle that we already know about from films such as ""The Godfather."" Once it gets going about half way through, however, it becomes rather compelling. Scorsese is the master of this sort of film, although his trademark obsession with violence is disturbing. De Niro plays the same character that he has played in a dozen movies. Although there are no likable characters, Pesci's is the worst. Bracco is sexy. Liotta is creepy-looking. This one probably holds the record for the number of f-words uttered.",
324,12 January 2014,tomgillespie2002,10," Still feels fresh, energetic and innovative 24 years on","During one of the many thrilling montage sequences littered throughout one of Martin Scorsese's most revered films, gangster Henry Hill arrives home at Christmas time with a giant white and tacky Christmas tree and announces ""I got the most expensive tree they had!"". This sums up the colourful characters that inhabit Goodfellas, cheap, trashy thugs who hold more value to material possessions with hefty price-tags than human life. It has been criticised for glamorising these criminal types, all sharp, shiny suits, slick hair and big cars, and it's easy to get lost amongst the glitz and lifestyle. But although Scorsese alludes to the appeal of this live-fast way of life, he doesn't have much sympathy for its characters, and rightly so. Henry Hill may be the protagonist, our window into this world of high-rolling mafioso, but when he's stripped of his 'friends' and cash, he's not much more than a coke-addled rat.",
325,14 January 2021,aghawks,10, Classic,"'Goodfellas' is a masterpiece. While not my favourite Martin Scorsese movie (2nd to ""The Departed"") it is incredible. The film is stunning in every single way. The consistently fine acting by the large cast, the cinematography, editing, dialogue, brilliant use of music, it's all breathtaking. But Scorsese and co-writer Mitch Pileggi never lose lose sight of their main goal - to tell a story. And in that it's really hard to beat this movie. As to the actors De Niro is on top form, Ray Liotta is amazing, and this is Joe Pesci's definitive performance. Plus you have Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, and lots of well known faces in small but important roles. A 10/10 must watch movie !!",

The talent of Mr. Scorsese and his life proximity to the Earthy atmosphere of the Gangster Film make for a double-barrel dose of the what is both familiar and yet strange to us all.

That director is Martin Scorsese; a man whose films, it seems, reach out to generation after generation because of their timeless studies of the male who's placed within a scenario of either psychological crisis or social misfit; often both. Scorsese's films are journeys, but they never seem to branch out beyond the constraints of a city or the small, designated and rather run down area in which they're set. There are no vast landscapes or set pieces involving glitzy cinematography; just down and dirty locales inhabited by people you wouldn't usually notice or want to pay much attention to, only Scorsese brings them to life in that way that he does.",

The author and director combined on the screenplay and it is viciously funny and the ensemble cast is magnificent. Joe Pesci earned an Oscar, ""do I amuse you"" sealed the deal. Robert De Niro is Jimmy Conway(Jimmy Burke in the book), and Ray Liotta is Henry Hill, the focus of the story. The accompanying soundtrack is, as usual with Scorsese, perfect. He and Tarantino have the best ears and eyes for film music. One of the best movies ever made.",

335,23 May 2001,Anonymous_Maxine,10," There is something that Martin Scorsese can't do. There has to be. But evidently, that thing doesn't have anything to do with movies.","Martin Scorsese's stunning gangster film Goodfellas is the true story of Henry Hill, a man that wanted to be a gangster for as long as he can remember, and who lived as a gangster for a significant portion of his life. Scorsese seems to suggest that his tendency toward a life of crime comes as a result of an unhappy childhood, particularly the brutal beatings that he received from his father as a kid. Ray Liotta gives an excellent performance as Henry Hill, and Robert DeNiro is just a bad-ass in the film. He makes an awesome gangster, and he just looks intimidating and interesting and impressive. True, the guy is just a phenomenal actor, but he can also play extremely opposite roles, such as the one he played in Scorsese's Mean Streets in 1973, as well as the nutcase Travis Bickle in Scorsese's Taxi Driver. Joe Pesci, also a Scorsese regular, and also a tremendously diverse actor, plays the part of the undeniably likeable but quick-tempered and highly ambitious Tommy, one of the most violent gangsters portrayed in the film (by the way, his similarity to Edward G. Robinson's performance as Rico Bandello in Little Caesar (1930) is extensive and unmistakable). On a trivial note, look for Scorsese's mother playing the part of Tommy's loving mother (almost a staple in Italian cinema) in the film. It's interesting that for a good portion of her screen time, she is telling stories from the past, exactly as she did in Scorsese's rather short film Italianamerican, which starred his mother and father as themselves.",

All the racketeer, the murder, the mayhem, these Goodfellas are the ones who could do it. They would make all these other gangsters look like amateurs. My father would hang around these neighborhoods when he was working for the NYPD. He encountered a mobster one and made it out fine. Then drugs went into the fray, and the downfall begins. Joe Pesci's character Tommy DeVito was such a potty-mouth, he kills a young man for messing up, at the end, he gets his just desserts. Then Hill rounds up the people he worked for.

Goodfellas is my favorite and is among director Martin Scorsese's best work. This is excellent storytelling and cinema with top tier camerawork, writing and editing. The ensemble cast did a phenomenal job knocking this out of the park giving authenticity to these characters and with Scorsese's tight direction brings this story to life. Even though Robert De Niro is a in a supporting role, this is still some of Scorsese's best work. Ray Liotta was up and coming as an actor and rises to the occasion as the lead in this film as mobster Henry Hill, holding his own cast alongside Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. As a whole the film comes together perfectly with great chemistry from the cast, no one outshines anybody and everything is done to service the story. The film might be longer than the average film, but never seems so as it has the viewer engrossed in the story. In my opinion this is perfect(or nearly flawless) film making. It is criminal that this did not win an Oscar for best film of that year, but through the years this really holds up and not only is this the best mob movie in my book, this is one of the best movies ever made and is mandatory viewing for anyone that wants to see a great movie.",

While this is happening, Hill's life and relationships were becoming more complicated for him to handle, he has to decide on whether he wants face death from his Mafioso allies or take his seat on the witness protection program.

The use of the oldies pop/rock soundtrack has often been imitated but never duplicated (though Pulp Fiction would be a comparable comparison).

Some good, some bad, and some severely overrated. But only Goodfellas, to this day, has ever handled the subject matter with such an unforgiving amount of raw, revealing truth. This is what ""The Life"" really looks like. It's beautiful, it's enticing, but most of all, it's brutal and depressing. And this film captures all those elements perfectly without adding a bunch of circus-like, drama theater nonsense for the sake of aesthetic. Being authentic and ruthlessly accurate to the subject matter naturally forms its own unique aesthetic; one many film goers could identify with because it wasn't trying to be flashy--it was trying to be real.

It is a long movie, but you do not feel its length. Scorsese does a genius job keeping the audience hooked with his quick-edit, fast-paced style. By the time the credits roll, you will be in a satisfied state of exhilaration. People compare this film to The Godfather. Not a knock on the aforementioned film, but these are two different styles that tell a story about the mafia. The Godfather is more of a broad, classical-style film while Scorsese creates something more realistic and something that centers on the importance of family. This seminal film is the reason why The Sopranos exist. David Chase was given a divine sense of inspiration. In addition, the performances are excellent across the board.

What's more - the queasy masculinity and brazenly unapologetic glorification of it all may be challenging and relatively authentic but Karen's quickly discarded alternative commentary is a weird choice.

This be one of them. From growing up at a young age around action and intrigue to entering into bigger than life situations this movie tells it well. However, when one takes a second closer look for reality sake we find that lying, cheating, stealing and killing makes for a poor excuse of a life and no amount of glorifying can help that. They often refer to this world as the underworld being dark and not fit to be lived in the light. That's why people in this world hang out together as no one else could tolerate them.

It also has a lot of memorable scenes making it a must own for your collection. I was glued to the film when I first saw it. It is a story well told and Ray Liotta delivers the goods 100%. Fascinating glimpse into the world of degenerates Mafioso type supposedly ""cool"" guys or so they would have you believe. The fact is it is a life of no responsibility and if you listen, a questionable future as the movie reveals. The story that this is based of real life Henry Hill couldn't believe he managed to live as long as he did always expecting to die at any moment. I mean we are all going to die but every moment?

At times it can seem almost alluring and seductive. Take the character of Karen for example, played excellently by Lorraine Bracco. One can pinpoint the approximate moment in which she becomes swept up in the lifestyle of Henry (Ray Liotta), right when she decides to hide a bloodied gun rather than go to the police as ""other girlfriends"" would do. Her voice-over from her first appearance is one of the film's only real insights into Henry's world from the outside world. From then on it's a slow process as she is swallowed into her husband's life. Some of it is subtle, like the line about the bag of money at the wedding and how no one would dare steal from the Mafia. In other instances she's shocked at what she's gotten into as we wake to see an extreme close up of a gun barrel pointed directly at the camera before she breaks down and realises she cannot do the deed.

Based on a true story (some say at least 90% accurately) this Martin Scorsese film casts Ray Liotta as Henry Hill, supported by Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and impressively Lorraine Bracco - Hill's much troubled wife. The dialogue is brilliant, the pacing of the film is exceptional, action is gritty and raw, in fact the whole film is a masterclass in film making. It's fascinating to watch lives lived to excess, but this in itself is fascinating as the audience is treated to a study of social behaviour in American gangster culture.

Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill, who gets enticed through the stages of an gangster when he pursues his dreams with his partners, Jimmy Conway and Tommy DeVito, played by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci.

Joe Pesci is the most frightening gangster ever seen for me and the scene where he winds Liota up with his ""how am i funny"" in the resterant is scary! Scorsese directs this film like no other. You can watch this film over and over again and see something new everytime (and i have). I think what also makes Googfellas so viewer friendly is the narration by Liota throughout the movie.You are never left in doubt as to what is going on.I must have seen Goodfellas a dozen times now and i'm sure there will be many more times i watch it.

This kind of plot has repeated itself many times before in other gangster movies: ""blow"", ""casino"", ""the Irishman"" and more. But Martin Scorsese nailed it the best. The movie has became since then a pop culture movie and a ""must watch"" film for all those who are film buffs. The characters are simply amazing and classic: Ray Liotta does a great work with his character and tells his story with expression and voice over, Robert DeNiro is awesome, he is the perfect actor for playing a mob gangster along with Pacino. Joe Pesci steals the show with his performance and has the best lines in the entire movie. Also many of the actors in the film became later on actors on the show ""The Sopranos"". The soundtrack is great. My favorite sequence is the one with the song ""layla"" by Derek and the Dominos. Overall this is one of Scorsese's best films along with ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The Departed"". Most people will remember this film for its catchy tone and how attempting it is.

419,10 May 2021,EdwardtheBlackPrince,9, Funny how like a clown I amuse you I make you laugh?,"Martian Scorsese's epic mobster classic Goodfellas tell the story of henry hill(Ray Liotta )from a young age has always wanted to be a gangster been working for the local crime family run by Paulie's Cicero(Paul Sorvino) along with his longtime partners in crime Jimmy Conway(Robert de Niro )and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) climbs through the ranks of the family and becomes a big success not knowing that with his actions and rewards will lead to a spiral of lies blood and betrayal. Goodfellas is one of the unique gangster movies where the focus is not kept on the action and brutal violence but rather on it's compelling characters and well written story Everybody in the movie gives outstanding performance. Ray Liotta overall not the only lead of the film focuses mainly on him Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci each given some of the best performances in their whole career with each having different aspects from the traditional type of gangster. Where Liotta is more ambitious with ideas and dreams of leisure, De Niro plays more of the calm calculating one he always has a plan, is careful not to step too far out poses a risk. He doesn't go over his head and he doesn't act without reason. Lastly there's Joe Pesci as Tommy who is arguably the best character in the movie as a out of control hothead who just doesn't give a damn what anybody has to say, doesn't take lip from anybody. Paul Savino also gives a great performance really feels and look like a mobster all of the men do. Lorraine Branco as Karen is great as well most films like this women are only around to be more of a pointless interest or object for the guy but here she plays an important role to Henry's character and gives him a reason for a fully developed character. The Film also has a very quaint style you follow story of Henry through 30 years of his life while he works through all this turmoil. The first half is the fun& the pleasure of the life where is the second half is the downfall You're seeing the turmoil he goes through. This is in alot of gangster movies but here it's different, because you're not following this big crime boss as a protagonist. You're following more of an underlying who just make his way to the top as opposed to say Scarface where Tony Montoya end up being the boss through violence and getting his hands dirty. You don't see Henry kill one person in this movie. It's almost as if your watching a book you're following along but, it's not just being shown it told to you. Constantly throughout the film Henery narrates moments thoughts and inner monologue's it gives you more of an idea What he thinks about the situation s and how we may change down the line. A similar style that Scorsese would use again later"" in his films Casino. Goodfellas is one of the most compelling Crime drama and still one of the best films of it's time that remains a staple in film history.",
420,15 December 1998,Peach-2,10, Scorsese's greatest film.,"I believe that Goodfellas is Martin Scorsese's greatest film. This movie is a film fan's dream come true. The acting is brillant. Ray Liotta is terrific as Henry Hill and Robert De Niro is great as Jimmy The Saint. Joe Pesci deserved his Oscar for a brillant and terrifying performance. Scorsese is the greatest film-maker of his generation and he has made alot of great films. Goodfellas tops them all. The way the camera moves, the way the narration grabs you and pulls you in and the characters themselves, top notch film-making at it's best. I loved this movie from the first minute to the last. I especially loved the ending where Liotta is running around doing his errands and snorting cocaine the whole time. Scorsese injects into his film style the paranoia that Liotta's character is feeling. In the process making our heart race at the same time. This is a great film and it is highly recommended.",
421,17 May 2014,RossRivero99,10, The Best movie of 1990,"Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is an epic historical mob film which is similar to Bugsy, and American Gangster. The movie tells the story of how Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta) and his mob friends Jim Conway (played by Robert De Niro), Tommy De Vito (played by Joe Pesci), and Paul Cicero (played by Paul Sorvino), ended up working their way up through the mob hierarchy. What Martin Scorsese tries to show not only how the mob underworld, but he also tries to show us how brutal the mob can really be against their own crime family members. Also without question Martin Scorsese is one of the world's greatest film directors, thanks to great movies like Gangs of New York, The Aviator, and his Oscar wining turn for The Departed. Both Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta give the best performances of their careers in Scorsese's well done mob picture. And another thing Scorsese tries to show us in this movie is the conflicts between Henry and his wife Karen (played perfectly by Lorraine Bracco). This was a mob movie achievement and of what I thought was an absolutely great movie.",
422,13 January 2013,PeterMitchell-506-564364,9," Not good, a great movie about some really bad fellas","Goodfellas is one of the best mafia films you'll ever been blessed to see in your lifetime, right down to the letter in terms of acting, directing, but especially scripting. I have this fantastic script in book form, where the film honors the script one hundred percent. Goodfellas is quite a scary movie in terms of it's character's attributes, the main one being Pesci's, his Tommy, played with such a haunting ferocity. This is the most scary performance I've seen in a mafia film. He makes the character he played in Casino, Nicky Santori, look tame, although the the two bare some resemblances, especially in the violence and recklessness department. The story is told through the eyes of mafia figure, Henry Hill, played superbly by Ray Liotta, his most notable performance, when the mentioning of this actor's name comes up. Hill who died a while back, had described the mafia as a dark and terrifying world as seen through this brilliant film. It's through his eyes we meet these characters, like Jimmy the Gent, Conway, De Niro excelling himself again, and also Paul Sorvino as Paulie Cicero, a Sicilian godfather less threatening cause of his laid back manner, but looks can be deceiving. We move through Henry's wannabe mafia type, from childhood, that had him skipping school, subjecting him to a whacking from his father here and there, right through to his two incarcerations, where after getting out of the second one, thanks to his mother in law who puts up bail, he is soon making a deal of immunity. Reasons. One, his wife (Bracco) who goes to see Deniro is pointed towards this alley where all these coats are hanging. Should she go in there? No, why? Cause she'll probably get whacked. She options to quickly take off instead. To me, this was the most terrifying moment in this near two and a half hour film. Two, the other reason, Deniro asks Liotta to whack a guy down in Miami, and knows that if he accepts this, he won't came back alive. Death is shown so cheaply here, where if you don't do the right thing, the probability of living is null. One of the hoods, Stax, played by Samuel L Jackson in one of it's memorable bloody scenes, is one such an example, where a montage of other victims follow. Goodfellas has some real bloody moments, one involving a connected guy who's celebrating, getting out, on Henry's Hill's actual birthday, where his mouth earns him a helluva of a bashing, followed by a freshly dug grave. When it comes to violence, this movie is uncompromising, but these thugs existed. Again at Goodfellas's end, as to Hill's living arrangements, once more we see that crime just doesn't pay, but it pays bloody well to seen this 1990 classic.",

424,2 March 2017,thejcowboy22,7, A Cornucopia of Mobsters,"What a feeling of fulfillment when you beat the system. The thrill of getting away with something with the presence of malice. Back in the 1970's I met a friend in Junior College who was a huge hockey fan. He lived in East Meadow, New York adjacent to the Nassau Coliseum which was the home arena for the New York Islanders ice hockey team. My friend wasn't made of money yet he attended all the home games. He invited me to one and I witnessed his underhanded operation of sneaking in to games. It didn't stop there. Not only did my friend sneak me inside,, He would go right back out and bring other people inside for a small fee. The patrons were not promised a seat but at least they had entrance and could watch by sitting in the aisle and hallways throughout the hockey match. The ticket takers were in on the scam as well. These employees of the coliseum were basically moonlighting for a second income. Our personal ticket taker was a Math teacher, we called him Mugsy. My friend was in his eighth grade math class. That's how the money making operation started. Between the second intermission we would meet at gate #9 and dive up the loot we collected and the scheme was born. We were thinking small so we expanded to all events rock concerts and basketball etc. We had it all and enjoyed the profits. Goodfellas is about a journey through the eyes of an impressionable young Henry Hill (Chris Serrone). We follow his journey into the underworld from his deficient living conditions in a poor Brooklyn Neighborhood watching his Father struggle financially, taking the Subway to work. From his bedroom window Henry discovered a new and exciting world watching the Mobsters at the Taxi stand across the street. He saw these fellows in business suits who parked their cars anywhere they wanted . Played card all hours of the night and controlled the neighborhood more efficiently than the cops with numbers and betting sheets. Henry was introduced to Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino) the head of the crew. Paulie had his hand in everything from high jacking trucks and stealing precious cargo at Idlewild Airport. Henry would accompany his rotund Brother Tuddy (Frank DiLeo) who also ran the neighborhood pizzeria. Henry worked himself upward in this world of gangsters. Henry was so involved that he quit going to school. One day Henry's Father received a letter from the school that Henry hasn't attended in months. A ballistic Mr. Hill beat up his son giving him a black eye. Henry intern went to Toody and said he has to quit. Toody and some fellows waited in front of the local post office for Henry's Mailman to return from his route. Henry Picked out the postman and they grabbed him and throw him in the back of their car drove over to the pizzeria and put his head in the oven. No more letters from school, No more letters to the house. It got so bad that Henry's Mother had to go down to post office and ask for her bills. To earn his keep and acclaim to the mob Henry would vandalize cars, sell bootleg cartons of cigarettes and accompany Tuddy on using outside telephones. Bar tending for Paulie in which he meets an out of control Jimmy Conway (Robert DiNero). Jimmy takes a shine to the young delinquent. Henry watched how Jimmy carried himself by hijacking trucks and downright stealing. Jimmy teams Henry up with another helper Tommy DeVito. Henry wins over the trust and honor of the mob by a recent bust by the FBI as they grab Henry for selling illegal cigarettes. Henry is acquitted of all charges from being a first time offender. Henry thought he failed them by getting caught but Jimmy tells a teary eyed boy the facts about loyalty. He didn't rat on his friends by not saying anything and telling them nothing as he slips a bill in his shirt pocket to the ovation and delight of the gaudy clad mobsters. Henry grows into adulthood Played now by Ray Liotta,working mostly with Tommy Played now by Joe Pesce working the airport and planning a huge heist. It was a glorious time with wiseguys and mobsters everywhere . One of my favorite scenes in this movie is the regular frequented mob restaurant as Henry narrates all the wiseguys in the joint. From Nicky Eyes,Pete the Killer, Freddy No Nose, Anthony Stabile and who could forget Jimmy Two Times. This movie continues through the corrupt life and slow down word spiral of organized crime through the eyes of Henry Hill. From his first big score to his marriage to Karen (Lorraine Bracco), his carousing and brief stint in the joint. Finally dealing in cocaine with his Pittsburgh connection. Honorable mention to actor Chuck Low as the Wig salesman/bookie Morris Kessler who I found very amusing throughout his scenes. Joe Pesce also with a violent performance along with Robert DiNero makes this an addiction in watching the wiseguys do their stuff. The film is enticing to any impressionable kid who wants life in the dangerous lane. The editing and period music adds to the charm of the life of the Goodfellas who had it all for the taking, so they thought! Meanwhile we used the Coliseum for
profit at least 10 more years before we were caught sneaking people inside. Our operation was finally shut down and an expensive court case followed as we were fined with malicious mischief plus lifetime banishment from the Nassau Coliseum.",
425,27 April 2017,jcorelis-24336,9, One of the best gangster films,"GoodFellas deserves its reputation as one of the best gangster films, and also one of the most realistic: some critics have called it a version of The Godfather without the romanticizing of the gangsters. Based on the actual autobiography of a minor player in the gang hierarchy, the film is one of Martin Scorsese's best, with several sequences of what critics have rightly called bravura film making. As expected from Scorsese, lots of language, some sex and drugs, and intense, shocking violence. But if you want a film like this, this is one you will want. In some ways the film is a trial run for the even longer and more ambitious Scorsese film Casino, which makes it interesting to see both films; personally I prefer the grittier Goodfellas. I saw it on the very good Warner Home Video Blu-Ray.",

Martin Scorsese is definitely on top of his game and Goodfellas has definitely cemented a spot in his impressive resume, along with Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Casino, The Departed, and The Wolf of Wall Street. It's not hard to see why Goodfellas is such a critically acclaimed movie and still a very popular movie amongst film fans.",
430,29 November 2019,andrewroy-04316,9, An impeccable deep dive into the allure and insidiousness of the crime world,"Goodfellas isn't a sprawling gang epic as I for some reason expected, but instead a much more personal and revelatory look at how a young man admires gangsters, becomes one and watches it envelop every part of his life, until he has no option but to reluctantly rat out his partners. The narration and camera work is extremely effective in making the viewer feel like they're going on this journey with Henry. It's certainly saying that crime snakes into every part of these men's lives, making them feel greedy and entitled to a lifestyle that they hadn't earned but also would have been unattainable by legal means, and the way it sours friendships, marriages, and personal sanity is obvious. Equally relevant, however, is how exciting and flashy it is when it's happening. You feel on top of the world, have all these friends, and can afford a luxurious lifestyle. It's easy to empathize with Henry and understand how he reached the point he did, even as we recognize how horribly twisted his priorities had gotten, and that's no small feat by Scorsese. Liotta is great in showing this transformation, and Pesci and De Niro were also great as crime lord characters. The ending really drives this duality home: what Henry laments in the film's conclusion isn't all the mistakes he made or that he gave up his friends (both would be reasonable), but that he no longer gets that glamorous life and has to live a humdrum daily existence. You'd think this would be a welcome and ideal change after how crime ruined his marriage and came close to killing him, but he misses the thrill of it. It's not hard to compare the narrative arc to one of drug addiction, where he craves the high until it envelops every part of his life. Scorsese's direction and script are wonderful, as the repetitive dialogue and the suddenness of violence in many scenes added to the authentic, gritty atmosphere of crime. It's a standout film by all accounts, and absolutely deserves its spot in the film pantheon as an all-time great movie.",

Let's talk first about the film script that tells the story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a boy who always wanted to be a gangster, here we have a complete narrative of his life, from the rise to the fall, through his dramas, love, death , Disagreements and glare. We do not have here a highly organized Italian mafia, our characters are not the ""Bosses"", quite the contrary, their criminal life begins with robberies and ends with traffic, their operations are well explained, such as the development of all characters, even characters Like that of Paulie who has little screen time are well developed. The photograph of the film is good, it is not memorable, but it knows how to play colors very well on screen, we do not have that dark palette as it is usually the mafia movies, here the color palette is warm, the warm weather is always present and the trail Sound is spectacular, nothing original tracks, only songs from the time when the film is passing, that passes all that sarcastic climate is counterpoint to what is being shown on screen, it is also worth mentioning the great editing and sound mixing Of the film. Joe pesci is one of the best supporting actors in the cinema, and he is completely incredible, and it's good that Scorsese did not manage to play the leading role for De niro - who does a sober and convincing performance - but for Ray Liotta, That in certain moments is even alien to the personage, but in the great part of the film delivers a mafioso very cunning, intelligent and even unconcerned with the world and its consequences. At the end of the day we have a movie that keeps its rhythm and the high level in all the acts, it is not completely perfect and not a masterpiece of the seventh art, but surely it is a spectacular movie.",

All his films are done with style and character. ""Goodfellas"" (1990) is a film which felt so realistic (it's based on a true story) and the way it was put together just looked impossible (with the editing,the dialog voice-overs, the angles, the setting, etc...) but that's what film-making is all about: making the impossible possible on the big screen and Scorsese did that and he succeeded. I can now see where Quentin Tarantino came from with his influences which I find fascinating. Goodfellas, in my opinion is better than the Godfather films and any other rip-offs. I just don't understand why this film didn't win best film of 1990 (""Dances with wolves"", what were they thinking!). It was because of the violence and the ironic thing is that's what the film's about: a life of violence in the mafia and all the film is doing is trying to show how violence is in reality (which is very important). Goodfellas is by far the greatest gangster film ever made in a long time and it's martin scorsese's best film along with 1976's Taxi Driver (the film that showed how an individual can be just be a complete nutter).

One of the most artistically successfull and critically acclaimed crime films, ""Goodfellas"" is one of the pinaccles of the Mob genre in cinema. Based on real life mobster Henry Hill's memoir ""Wiseguy"", famed director Martin Scorsese's first foray into the gangster flick is a frenetic crowded rush streaming through like a cocaine high. Violence, vulgarity, crime and the soap opera of the underworld are vividly and brutally shown in all their humorous, absurd and senseless glory. The topnotch direction and star-studded cast shine with the unknown at the time Liotta stealing the show with his thug with a heart portrayal.

442,6 April 2000,bat-5,10, One of the best mob movies ever made.,"Martin Scorsese pulls you into the world of Henry Hill so effortlessly, you don't even realize that nearly two and a half hours have gone by.  Henry Hill gives us first person narration in his rise through the ranks of the mob.  He goes from being a small time hood, to a major player. Along the way, we meet his partners in crime: Jimmy Conway and Tommy DeVitto.  These two are played with finesse and bombast by Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci.  We get glimpses into the lives of wiseguys.  They have money, power and girls.  But underneath the glossy surface, there's always the treat of violence that could erupt at any time.  An off the cuff remark from Henry sends Tommy into a rant that borderlines a catastrophe.  Scorsese pulls no punches in delivering the violence that fills the lives of these people.  Life in the mob is not a glamorous life, it's filled with threats, violence, and paranoia.  One of the best sequences in the film is toward the end where Henry starts out his day at 6:55 AM and it gets worse from there. Scorsese pulls you into Henry's frantic world by the voiceover, and pretty soon, you're concerned about the dinner that Henry is planning.

Most people would argue that the Godfather 1 and 2 are the better mob movies. I must admit that the afformentioned movies are also brilliant and deserve to be in the top ten. I think the things that sways me towards Goodfellas are number 1, the dark sense of humour this movie imbues. The tone of the Godfather's can be much too serious at times. Just because it,s a serious drama doesn,t mean thers's no room for a little levity at times. This movie moves along quite nicely,while the Godfather gets a little bogged down at times....especially the wedding scene which in my mind was about ten minutes too long. Both movies had brilliant direction and performances....i guess i'll call that one a draw. If you like this one check out Casino. It's not as good as Goodfellas or the Godfather's but still very deserving of a viewing.

You can hear Liotta's character describing the joys of the life they led. At the same time you are presented with certain scenes from this life where you can also see the backside of the medal. Many mob movies are like this. They show this really charming culture of, well, people celebrating their own importance, and a culture based on respect, tradition and hierarchy. But then you typically see it all falls apart, so it wasn't a good idea after all. This movie plays around a bit with this, showing you both sides of the medal from the get go, but as the story progresses you can gradually see the medal turning around, going from having the positive side in focus, to having the negative side in focus. But, as mentioned, both sides of the medal are visible from the start till the end. This is maybe the most obvious in the ending scenes, with how the narration relates to what you see.",

Based on the true memoir of the Lucchese crime family, later turned into an book entitled ""Wiseguy"", by Nicholas Pileggi, ""Goodfellas"" shows the memoir of Henry Hill, and his association with his infamous crime family, as they go through the rises and falls of their lives. In a terrific all-star cast, Scorsese has gathered some of the biggest names in movies from Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco, and Joe Pesci, all delivering one memorable performance after the other. Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco, however, steal most of the screen time, both delivering respective performances, and they know how to show their stuff. Although delivered limited screen time, Robert De Niro and Paul Sorvino delivered memorable performances, revealing how they became stars in the first place. But it's Joe Pesci's Oscar-winning performance that makes the movie, stealing almost every scene he's in. Director Martin Scorsese has totally knocked the ball out of the park with this movie. ""Goodfellas"" is the movie that precisely shows how extraordinary a director that Scorsese is. He perfectly captures the true gangster life, and tells the story in such a brilliant profession. Everything about this movie is filmmaking at it's finest. From the incredible performances by the ensemble cast, the brilliant well-written dialouge, directing, editing, cinematography, and music. By the way, this movie has some of the best writing ever put to film. The dialouge feels authentic and realistic, and it reveals the realism of it all. The violence is brutal and bloody, and some moments will leave you speechless. It doesn't matter if you're a fan of gangster films, or film in general, everybody will find something to love in ""Goodfellas"". Although this movie lost the Best Picture Oscar to ""Dances with Wolves"" in 1990, ""Goodfellas"" was a more better choice. This is an authentic, powerful, and excellent piece of work from the great Martin Scorsese. This is also one of my favorite movies of all time.

I slept with her.. yeahh but remember that time where you bowled a 300 and then ate 2 big macs ... at burger king! .. heh you see he's so awesome that burger king made HIM a big mac! What a guy!

There should have been a better musical score when it wasn't classic rock or things like that. There's no suspense. Yes this isn't an action movie but still that's my first issue and there's at least a cohesive plot. At the end of he day we've all seen worst movies and we've certainly seen better movies.

Henry Hill started as a child being enthralled with the Mafia life. His dad just a regular working stiff . Henry was seduced by the life, the money, the excitement, the risks and of course the women. Excellent acting by all. This movie , singlehandedly , brought back the organized gang movies , we all loved from the 70s. In fact, this film was a segueway to 'The Sopranos'. Lorraine Bracco of 'The Sopranos' as well as Michael Imperioli ,in a bit part ,contributed to the fine acting. Throw in the character of Morrie and a wet behind the ears Samuel L. Jackson, and this ensemble ,was even more unbelievable. Perhaps the best acted movie of the 90's. This movie really portrayed the gang life in just under 2 and half hrs. If I do have one criticism, I think the film did not truly show the ordinary parts of life , that these people have when they are with their families, as 'The Sopranos. I did not take away points because 'The Sopranos' had all the time in the world to get away with that. This film , cleverly, pointed out how even top members of organized crime are not immune from violence or even from financial failure for that matter. I liked the narration by Ray Liotta. I think that really helped educate people , as to THE LIFE and the rituals of organized crime.This movie also did an excellent job with the costumes and the film set, to bring us back to these earlier dates.

All the usual good Scorsese elements are present: the great camerawork (especially the famous tracking shot through The Copacabana), the choice of music, the fantastic acting, the snappy and unpredictable dialogue and characters. The journey as an audience member perfectly mirrors that of the main character. It's fun to enter this world of crime and go along with the character, until events spiral out of control with increasing violence against innocents. The ending of the movie feels sad and uncomfortable, which is just the way the main character feels. I think that's why this isn't a perfect 10/10 for me; while the pacing/plot perfectly matches what the main character goes through, it makes for a less-enjoyable last 30 minutes.

The use of music in the film is wonderful, the cinematography, particularly in the edgy scene in January 1980 when...well, you know. and yeah, absolutely the best use ever (by a long shot) of voice-overs. Liotta's Hill is the apparently normal guy whose sympathetic narration give the film its connection to a supposedly reasonable person. The story is amazing, the acting is amazing, and the depiction of a Mob in which everything is not peachy keen for those making out like bandits (no pun intended) seems fair (not that I'd know....really..).

502,12 July 2008,HelloTexas11,9, what a ride,"'Goodfellas' could be described as ""'The Godfather' on speed,"" but that wouldn't really be accurate. The two movies are very different. The mobsters in 'Godfather' are dignified by comparison. Those in 'Goodfellas' have practically been driven mad by power, money, and eventually, dope. At least one of them, Joe Pesci's Tommy, is quite literally insane. The film moves at a lightning pace, narration provided by the character Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco.) We see what takes places through Henry's (and to lesser degree, Karen's) descriptions, though it plays out right in front of us as well. Robert De Niro plays Jimmy, a charismatic gangster who is part of the mob but also something of a free agent; he can never be 'made' (the ultimate distinction the crime family can bestow on a member) because of his Irish roots. The same goes for Henry. He earns his place in the mob by starting at an early age as an errand boy willing to do anything, which endears him to the mob and their boss, Paulie. The violence in 'Goodfellas' is all the more appalling because for the most part, it is so casually administered. Tommy, for example, will kill anyone for the slightest perceived insult, with no more thought or regret than he would have ordering a drink. People are routinely beaten up savagely if they get crossways with any of the mob figures. But there is much more to the film than that, and I should point out there's a great deal of humor in the film, some of it laugh-out-loud funny. At times, it's like the most twisted comedy you've ever seen. 'Goodfellas' also shows how this 'community' of criminals and their families live; it takes place in and around New York City for the most part. Not surprisingly, it is a very tightly-knit group. Once Karen marries Henry, she has no contacts or life outside the extended 'family.' All of her female friends are wives of other mobsters. Birthdays, weddings, holidays... these are only shared with family insiders. This quirky little subculture has its own rules, standards and perks. For instance, there is one night a week designated for the men to take their mistresses out for drinks at a nightclub. Serving a prison term is accepted with a shrug; it seems almost all the men have served time at one point or another. Henry's first prison stint gets him congratulations from the others. It's like a badge of honor or a rite of passage. The lifestyle is very fast-paced, almost maniacally so. Everyone the mobsters deal with is paid off with wads of cash: cops, delivery boys, waiters, prison guards, you name it. Every gangster in the family carries with him a roll of hundreds (occasionally twenties); I've never seen so much currency exchange hands so frequently as in 'Goodfellas.' Eventually, despite Paulie's prohibition against it, several of the men including Henry begin dealing in drugs, specifically cocaine, which he and Karen are soon hooked on. The final scenes show a paranoid, out of control Henry totally wired from the coke, backed into a corner, the only way out being to turn government informant and enter the witness protection program. Turns out old Don Corleone, in that very different film 'The Godfather,' was right. Drugs did end up destroying the mob to a large degree. 'Goodfellas' shows that, but what an insane thrill ride it must have been... like a roller-coaster going a thousand miles an hour straight down into hell.",

Pesci's character is established, as is Liotta's unlikeable character. This and other memorable scenes are better than movie as a whole. There are great actors (DeNiro, Pesci, Sorvino). Others (Liotta and Lorraine Bracco) may be great, but only if they were supposed to be as irritating as they come across. All things considered, still a great film.",

Scorsese has stepped back into his gangster stepping shoe's and has devised a movie so perfectly acted, directed and classy that it'l be a hard decision to name the best gangster movie ever amounted. For Scorsese, this was a simple task and one which he had visited before (Mean Streets), and so was familiar with the history of the period and the style e.t.c.",

A boy wants to be a gangster, he becomes a gangster, he rises in ranks, gets very influential, very much money, girls, wives, drugs, killings, robberies and it all becomes to much for him.

515,13 March 2005,ilovedolby,10, A Mob-Epic!,"There is a fascination with the underworld that exists in everyone. We find ourselves drawn to the headlines of gang wars and those caught in the middle. After all, Al Copone was a crook, but also a celebrity. It is this fascination that has captivated audiences with gangster pictures from the 1930s with James Cagney in ""The Public Enemy"" to the more recent ""Goodfellas"" from director Martin Scorsese. The latter picture, with its sense of realism, like ""The Public Enemy"" stands the test of time. Its characters are every bit as terrifying, especially Tommy De Vito played by Joe Pesci as was Cagney's portrayal of Tom Powers. And of course with Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta, one can only expect explosive portrayals. ",
516,27 March 2021,t-09747,6, Not bad but overrated and definitely not the best of Scorsese,I've been coming across this Scorsese's movie many times but couldn't make myself watch it for some reason despite its super high rating. But since it became cinematography classic I had to watch it some day. And that day is today.,
517,13 February 2005,ryan_kuhn,10," ""Am I A Clown, Do I Make You Laugh?""","There are two halves to this movie. The first half is the opening of the world to Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), the world is his oyster. The second half is the claustrophobic closing in on his world by everyone. It is how director Martin Scorcese is able to get the audience to feel these emotions where the genius of Goodfellas comes from. The visual cues given to the audience further the story along as much as the dialog does. Who's-who of Italian actors all star in this story about the mob in New York before Henry Hill enters the ""Witness Protecion Program."" Based on the book by Hill, it details his entire life, from a young boy wanting to be part of the mob, to his 20s when he's part of the clan, getting into the back doors of his favorite clubs, making money off airline heists. It then shows his downfall, drugs begin to take over his and his wife's life (played by Lorraine Bracco of Dr. Melfi fame), leading up to the defining moment of the movie when the Hills are shadowed as they move about town by an ominous looking helicopter all day. The feeling of the walls closing in is choking as Hill knows it's checkmate and he has to go over to the other side. The movie also stars Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway, who like Hill is not Italian so can never become a ""made man"" but still runs the mob while most of the higher-ups are in jail, Joe Pesci, who won an Oscar for his role, as the hotheaded Tommy DeVito, and various other well known Italian actors. Considered one of the finest movies involving the mob not named The Godfather, Goodfellas shows both how wonderful it can be to be in the mob, but also the costs, the emotional strains on the families, and the ultimate price paid. To this day, Henry Hill is still in ""The Program,"" while most of the characters chronicled in the film are either dead or just getting out of jail. A great visual look at both the good and bad of the mob, and all that goes with it.",

There's not a single likeable character to be found as almost everyone is a cold-hearted hot head who wouldnt hesitate to kill you even if you just bump into them by accident.

What more can I say I couldn't think of a better cast to carry this film, especially the scene stealing Joe Pesci.",
523,1 October 1999,Elizabeth-328,9," ""Murderers come with smiles...""","I think this is a great movie.  Based on a true story, it shows how friends go from pulling petty crimes to committing bloody murders.  Rat Liotta is wonderful as Henry Hill, the small time gangster who eventually gets caught up in the serious and deadly mob life.  Robert De Niro is brilliant, as always, as Jimmy Conway.  And Joe Pesci is great (even if he's a little vulgar) as Tommy De Vito, his Oscar winning role.  The saddest part is when Tommy is really excited about getting in to the exclusive, 100% Italian mafia, and then ends up getting killed.  I really feel Jimmy's pain when he mourns the loss of his friend.  Even though they're really bad people, they still have feelings for their friends. ",
524,5 June 2005,mattsox44,2, Best Movie Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is easily my all time favorite movie. The pacing is electric and the acting is fantastic. The mix of dark dark humor, drama and action is fantastic. Everyone always talks about Pesci's great performance and rightfully so, but DeNiro gives the second best performance of his career (after Raging Bull) in this movie. Understated but fantastic. Ray Liotta is also excellent, although somewhat overshadowed by Pesci and DeNiro. The last 25 minutes of the movie where Liotta's character is trying to unload guns on his ""Pittsburgh connection"" and get a cocaine shipment out the door all while preparing a large Italian meal for his whole family is amazing. Many people tell me that I am nuts for liking this movie because it glorifies the mafia life, but I think it does just the opposite. If you have not seen this movie, rent it immediately.",

527,26 May 2019,mohit_sinsniwal,6, A classic mobster movie of 90's,"This is one hell of a film about the mobsters, based on a true story and coming from one of the great directors of all time. This is about Henry Hill, the narrator of the story, an Irish simple person who gets involved with the Mafia at a very young age and continues his life through it. There is no major plot in this film, just isolated incidents one of which was the turning point of Hill's life. Scorsese, as brilliant as he ever was, shows violence, sex and drugs etc in his own trademark style. And his actors helps him to make this film one of the classics.",

The film features interesting and effective cinematography and it was notable how the shots were filmed in the ""drugs"" portion of the film. The soundtrack featured a number of notable songs like the end of ""Layla"" and ""Jump Into the Fire"".",
529,24 August 2020,chiluvr1228,2, Most overrated movie I've ever seen,"I heard so much about this movie so when I saw the DVD in the $5 bin I picked it up. Halfway through the movie I was ready to just shut it off. While the acting was excellent, there was a lot of violence and there really was no plot and nobody to root for in this overly long mob movie. Every character was just plain unlikeable and by the end I didn't care who got whacked.",
530,20 June 2007,arthera09,8, little trouble relating to anything in this movie,"I really enjoyed this movie and I thought it was very well done. A lot of people rave about some of the acting, but I think Ray Liotta did a pretty bad job and some scenes were just not right. I think it was extremely well directed and the long scene when Henry goes into the jazz club was perfect. I wouldn't even know how to set up a shot like that. I am not a director, but I cannot imagine it being easy with so many extras and and the timing must have been a nightmare. It really does set up the movie very well. I loved Tommy's character and being played by a smaller man makes it understandable why he was so crazy. I think the music was perfect. It started out with some great jazz vocals and then when one hears ""Cocaine"" riff in the background one knows everyone's lives are going to go to hell. I liked how it ended with a punk song. Such a good soundtrack. The way the scenes were cut were great. The first part of the movie started with a lot of long cuts that were smooth and then it got sharper and much more frantic. Full props to Martin (I don't know how to spell his last name) and I liked the use of actual people involved in the case. The one problem I have with this movie is that I cannot relate to any of the characters or what they are going through. The motivations even if they are real seemed silly and it is like a bunch of kids on a playground. No one could do that movie better and the casting of Ray Liota was the only thing I would have changed and it will be timeless, but I cannot relate to it.",
531,4 November 2016,tiskec,9, Mobster Classic!,"I enjoyed this movie very much. It was very sincere and had a one- hundred percent believable story-line. I respect that a lot. It even made it more believable because of the settings time era. During this time, events that the movie portrayed probably had occurred. Nothing was too much of a negative eye-roller in this film, which is a plus. Actually it's a surprise. Most gangster movies, at least in my experience, have stretched a story-line a little too far to create unneeded excitement or thrill. ",

533,21 January 2020,Oktay_Tuna,9, Just the Negatives,"I feel like I don't have the capability to explain the good parts in this movie so I just want to explain the parts I found weak compared to the other parts. First of all Joe Pesci was 10/10 in this movie but for me Liotta was kinda a 6/10. It needed a better actor for such a main actor. The movie was so great that, Liotta's good acting seemed not enough, I wanted something as Pesci. The other thing I didn't like was the whole narrative. Scorsese uses this trick a lot and I would rather watch and understand the story rather than listen to a story like it is an E-Book. I found that very weak. Other than that everything was 11/10.",
534,17 April 2003,Twins65,9," ""I thought you said you were alright, Spider""?","How this movie lost the 1990 Best Picture Award to ""Dances with Wolves"" is one of Hollywood's great injustices.

535,17 November 2009,rebschucks,9, Not for Everyone!,"I think this is actually an amazing film, and I'm surprised ""Dances With Wolves"" beat it out in the Academy Awards. It's raw, it's dark, and it stays with you long after you've seen it. I can certainly appreciate the movie for being quite possibly the most accurate mob movie in movie history. Nothing here is romanticized. They may have had a lot of perks, made a lot of money, but at what cost? That is ultimately the theme that is explored in ""Goodfellas""",

The time of year where hearing one more carol or watching one more commercial for frozen ham will surely send anyone over the edge. It's also the time that almost every major film studio tries their hand at making a quick buck by releasing some generic, light- hearted holiday movie you've probably seen in some form already. I don't care for these films at all, which is why I have all the more reason to thank Fox Classics for their Spotlight On Scorsese Week, which ended last Friday with what is, in my opinion, the greatest film ever made by the greatest filmmaker alive today.",

Ray Liotta's narration gives you the lay of the land on the story and never grates on your nerves. Martin Scorcese's direction is a thing of beauty and Joe Pesci's performance is the best of his career, even considering he played basically the same character in Casino. A great soundtrack and dazzling cinematography make this film a national treasure. Bottom Line: The power of this film cannot be underestimated and I wouldn't be out of line by saying this is Scorcese's best film. Truly a masterpiece.",

A very big part of that is due to the actors having a lot of charisma in their roles. Joe Peshi is the best example of this. He is very violent and easily tempered, and does a good job at adding more to the character with his great acting. It is a very big part of of crime drama history.

Joe Pesci, who I usually find funny, began to irritate me but Paul Sorvino's Pauly truly made me feel like I could identify with these characters...he was awesome! The rest of the cast really helped to pull this amazing movie together. Then to find out it was actually based on a true story, WOW!

562,4 January 2010,brandon_lee420,8, A gem!,"The strange thing about me is that I only saw Goodfellas in the morning and I had no idea that a film like this could blow me away. I started watching it at twelve midnight and was expecting myself to fall asleep but thankfully it didn't because the story grips you and doesn't let go. For a movie that is two and a half hours long, it didn't have any boring bits and every scene was better than the last. The narration by the main character is neat and I really like it how he explained his life from the point he became a gangster all the way to the end. The acting was superb by everyone, famous and not so famous, because they just fitted comfortably in their roles. The actor who amazed me the most was Joe Pesci mainly since his comedy makes you laugh out loud but he also had a darker role as well. He played a gangster who would kill if he was spoken to the way he didn't like. Robert De Niro played the calm but paranoid gangster who gave money to people because they opened doors for him. Goodfellas is mainly about a boys life as he grows up and turns into a gangster. Ray Liotta plays the role exceptionally well but one thing that made me didn't like him was his annoying laugh. Martin Scorsese should have cut that part out and chucked into the lave of Krakatoa. When the film finished at two thirty, I stayed still digesting the film and was amazed by what had happened. It truly is a treasure and every DVD collector should have it in their collection. A film like Goodfellas perfectly explains a gangsters life, his marriage, his family and kids, his friends, his sins and good deeds, to the point where your brain is pouring out the information because it can't stand it. Goodfellas is the only film that has got a perfect ten from me in the last six or seven months. A masterpiece! Kids and adults should watch it (f*ck the rating system) and should definitely have a good time watching the best film from Martin Scorsese. The sound and music is very nice when a thrilling part comes on and it gives you a tingling sensation. ""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster."" -- Henry Hill, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1955, is the best line in film history in my opinion.

Where ""The Godfather"" limits itself to a sepia palette and a somber tone, ""Goodfellas"" is brash, busy, and captures both the humor and the horror of a mobster's life. Nor do the Goodfellas pretend to have noble motivations. Instead, they're a bunch of power-hungry guys who band together for protection but double-cross each other at the first opportunity. Many admit to a compulsive love for crime, including robber Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and, especially, the unhinged, trigger-happy Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).",
565,27 May 2001,rmarkd,10, One of the best films ever made,"I live in Emeryville, California (near SF, CA, which is more well known than Emeryville), and one of my favorite ways to spend a couple of hours is to head over to Everett&Jones for Ribs and watch Goodfellas. From the beginning, it draws you in to the mafia life following Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) rise from childhood dreams of being a gangster along with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro), and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci in an amazing role). From the beginning, Scorsese captures the romance and logic of being a gangster. Young Henry Hill saw the beauty of it all. ""It was out of respect"" he says, when kids carried his mother's groceries all the way home for her. ""It was better than being president"", he says. And why not? Gangsters seemed immune to police, law, having to pay bills. That's the beauty that draws you in. ",
566,2 March 2009,stumpmee77,9, This is more realistic than the Godfather,What crime lord is going to have a wedding so out in the open that the press of cops could show up? No putting Godfather 1& 2 down (Now #3 is a whole other story) but based on documentaries I've seen Goodfellas better captures the feel of the Mafia world. From Paul Sorvino's Don on down the group introduced to us plays down their money. Godfather's characters just don't. ,
567,17 July 2016,sbhblore,2, A Movie for Thugs and crooks,I would have given a 1 star but for the tremendous performance by all the cast in the movie. I fail to understand how can anyone ever give a very high rating to this movie?. ,
568,18 February 2018,parameswaranrajendran,8, This is dope,Goodfellas - A based on true story filmed by director Martin Scorsese in 1990. This movie is dope crime drama. One heist changes the entire life of the three main protagonist forever. Only the title is goodfellas but they are really bad fellas. Robert DeNiro Joe Pesci Ray liota,
569,16 April 2013,raphaklopper,10," ""As far as I can remember ... I always wanted to be a gangster,"" that phrase started this masterpiece and followed to the end.","""GoodFellas"" is simply (after ""The GodFather"") the best-mafia gangster film ever made, and this is very clear in this movie.",
570,14 March 2020,Mnemosyne15,8, About the torture of humanity and morality,"To some extent, the most successful part of the film is its self-confidence in dealing with the rhythm and theme given by its authenticity.Its authenticity extends to the protagonist Henry's intention to join the gang, the desire for material desires, and a primitive and unadorned violent worship. At the same time, the unhappiness of family life gave him a desire to be recognized and recognized. Regarding his enthusiastic pursuit of self-worth recognition, he stuck his face to the window and looked at the people across the street. Since then, the whole film has always been compact, from his stepping into the den across the street to becoming one of them. Then met Tommy and Jimmy, and then went to commit crimes, start a family, commit a major crime, and finally went to jail, pleaded guilty, and assisted the police to confess other associates, and was included in the witness protection plan. From an outsider's perspective, I can't find the climax of the film. Some people say that the climax is Henry's imprisonment, but I think Scorsese will not be too interested in the popular theme of punishing evil and doing good. From the perspective of the dictator, the climax of the film should be the most popular part of the three brothers' illegal business. Since the killing of Tommy, the film has reached an inevitable ending.",
571,4 November 2011,ereinion,10, Simply great,"What is the formula behind making the perfect gangster movie? It has to be long, short gangster movies seldom work. There has to be a wide variety of characters, movies like ""The Hoodlum"" were dull because there were only a few main characters there. Here even the minor characters are well developed, enough to catch your eye. And last, it has to show some violence but in moderate quantities. There is some violence here, most notably in the ""Billy Batts scene"", but it never overflows, ""Casino"" had far more violent scenes than this film. If there is no violence whatsoever, then the movie can't be an effective gangster/mafia movie.",
572,19 August 2020,El-Ak,7, Maybe it was great by then!,"Actually I wasn't impressed by the film and that's rare for a Scorsese film that I watch. If the film was great like other 90s films, it would still be awesome now but it isn't. I didn't like Ray Liotta being the lead at all a very narrow actor who is not even that attractive in his performance even was melodramatic bat some points with Lorraine Bracco that made me feel annoyed at some points. On the other hand, the one and only Robert Den Niro didn't get the time he deserved in this film with his captivating performance and yet was able to make a remarkable performance though I didn't feel the story helped him much. Also Joe Pesci was great and powerful as If he was the heart of the film. But the story athoug it's good is predictable at some points with an average director from Scorsese which I began to notice at the stupid scene when Ray got into a fight with someone with his hands so obviously not hitting the other person's face and that person puts his hand covered with ketchup on his face to appear as If he was bleading which was a true dump scene. The score of the film helped much also but I give all the cause for not liking it is for the weak predictable story with the worst lead actor ever.
7/10",
573,5 June 2017,scyyoung,10, The best Mob movie ever made.,"GoodFellas gets a 5/5 which does this film justice due to the amount of unique film techniques utilized by Martin Scorsese and the length of the movie that never seems to stagnant. The film manages to cover a two and a half decade timeline with the additions of narratives from two of the films main characters to pace the film correctly and fill in details that would've been impossible to inform us in 146 minutes or cover a 25 year timeline, which is integral when documenting a story of a character from childhood to manhood while including other aspects of his life.",
