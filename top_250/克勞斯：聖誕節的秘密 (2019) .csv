0,22 December 2019,cricketbat,8," In a sea of generic Christmas movies, Klaus stands out","Klaus is an amusing new twist on a very old story. It's a heart-warming tale with an uplifting message about kindness, featuring beautifully unique animation, interesting characters, and a clever plot. In the sea of generic Christmas movies that get churned out each holiday season, Klaus stands out because it tried something different and it succeeded.",/
1,14 November 2019,Joejoesan,9," Wow, we finally have a new Christmas classic","Okay, when it comes to Christmas movies to me there was only one: It's a wonderful life by Frank Capra. The Bishop's Wife and Love Actually are also very good but they don't have the same magic.
This year I can finally add a new classic: Klaus. It's a funny and surprising tale of how the real Santa Claus was born. I love the story and especially the look of this movie is amazing. Klaus is hand drawn animation but thanks to computers it has astonishing lit scenes. That makes the journey extra special.",r

But what sappiness was in the movie well used. The main thrust was not sappy. It was a well told story, with the proper nuances in the animation and the vocalization. I consider this movie to be for adults. You will thoroughly enjoy it.",e
3,9 December 2019,CubsandCulture,10, My Christmas watchlist just got a little longer,"Everything about this droll take on the Santa myth is inspired.

Even the final moment of magical realism is just right. It all adds up to a heart warming tale of Christmas.",v

16,17 November 2019,aidanratesmovies,10, An Absolute Delight,"Fun-spirited and an absolute delight, Klaus just may be not only the best christmas movie of the year, but also of the decade. Fit with beautiful animation, wonderful voice work, and a charming sense of direction, Klaus aims to please and does so almost irresistibly. The film, at its worst, may seem a bit formulaic, but is plenty full of many surprises without that will make you not want to look away from the screen. The film is also cleverly funny, with humor on par with that of The Emperor's New Groove and another Christmas classic of the decade, Arthur Christmas. What's so remarkable about the film however, is that, besides its ownership under Netflix, it simply isn't owned by a huge animation company. It feels small, and looks underwhelming, and like a gift of the same nature, is an absolute delight once you find what is all truly inside.
My Rating: 9.75/10",8

18,17 November 2019,arcticerika,10, Wholesome and Original,"Klaus was a heartwarming animation with a very unique take on the ""Christmas origin"". I originally put it on as background noise for folding laundry but caught myself sitting on the bed for the entirety of the movie. The animation was really well done and the characters were memorable. I loved the similarities with Tim Burton films. It's nice to have a different Christmas film but that has the spirit nevertheless.
One of the best Christmas animations in awhile. Great film!",?

Is the plot very original? Maybe not, but it is well paced and has some surprises along the way that make Klaus special.
Here, we have a sincere, funny and engaging film, that doesn't rely on ironic jokes to tie in the adults, or on the integration of modern technology to hold the kids' interest. It just tells a story.",e

28,17 November 2019,LBmoviesenthusiast,10, Masterpiece,"Maybe because I did not know much of it when we chose to watch it with the kids, maybe because it was a cosy evening together with family, maybe because most good things happen unexpected, but it was just so much enjoyable that it scored immediately the top of my personal animation movies¬¥ ranking, even more than my beloved the incredibles....
The first 10 minutes I thought I was watching the wrong movie....what the hell has a spineless spoiled son of the chief postman to do with Santa Claus??? And then piece by piece ""you connect the dots....""....and it¬¥s a revelation, an epiphany, a ""credible"" discovery/explanation of the origin of Santa Claus¬¥ many legends, but most of it, a memory of the reason why the world needs Xmas, or whatever you call it if you are not Christian, because ""an act of selfless kindness...."". Don¬¥t miss it!!!",r

Touching and absolutely beautiful!",
33,22 January 2020,matthewssilverhammer,8, Best Animated Movie of 2019,"Klaus has all the best elements of Disney, Laika & even some Burton, all rolled into one. It's firmly planted within the tradition of animation (slapstick humor, bouncy score that matches visuals, broad but heartfelt themes) but pushes it into the future. It's so rare nowadays to watch a children's movie that's this original, where you can't immediately tell where it's going or how it's going to get there. A wonderful origin story that honors the importance of legends as much as the truth behind them.",

36,9 December 2021,MissSimonetta,10, A new Christmas classic,"Beautifully animated, KLAUS is that perfect balancing act of heartfelt sentiment and hilarious comedy. The story goes beyond being just another Santa Claus origin story. It's a lovely fable about finding meaning in your life despite the lure of resentment, grief, or pleasure. Because the characters' circumstances start out so dismally, the Christmas Joy-- usually a given in these movies-- is not taken for granted and feels all the more precious.",

And, to teach him a lesson, his father sends him to work as a postman in the hellish Scandinavian town of Smeerensburg. Why is the place so bad? It's incredibly unfriendly and gray....with locals constantly feuding with each other for generations.

40,17 November 2019,bradencn,10, Stunning,"This is the best Christmas movie I have ever seen. I grew up as a kid in the 90's surrounded by classics, such as Home Alone, The Santa Clause, Elf, and so many more. This movie is brilliant in its wit and humor, and it touches in the heartstrings of the human soul like no other movie of this genre ever has for me. I was awed by the creativity and the brilliance of the plot, writing, and animation. I will watch this movie each year with my family - a new family tradition.",

43,3 December 2019,paulclaassen,8, Delightful and Beautiful!,"Ahh, simply marvellous! Another classic to watch every year for Christmas. In the vein of 'The Polar Express' and 'Arthur Christmas', this is a beautiful story with wonderful characters and great animation. It might not be your conventional Father Christmas, but this film tells the story of how it all began. The film also tells us who he was before becoming Father Christmas, or Santa - a regular family man who suffered a sad loss.",
44,25 January 2020,851222,8, A good animated movie,Greetings from Lithuania.,
45,29 December 2020,ironhorse_iv,9, Stamp and delivered. This Netflix movie was a wonderful well-made masterpiece. A jolly good time.,"Very similar to that of the 1970 Rankin & Bass stop motion special 'Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town'; this motion picture tells an alternate fictional tale of the origins of the Kris Kringle myth, independent from the historical version of Saint Nicolas. Kinda glad they did that rather than digging too deep in the complex & highly complicate biblical story. That choice would bog the story down. Although I doubt diehard evangelicalism would feel the same. They probably would have love to see more of that or a mention of Jesus Christ. Anyways, set in the Far North of some unnamed Nordic country, 'Santa Claus is Comin' To Town' and this flick rotated around a postman telling the story of how a thoughtful toymaker brought joy to a gloomy isolated village. Although this movie written and produced by animator Sergio Pablos's company in his directorial debut told the tale much better. Even if the mailman named Jesper voiced by Jason Schwartzman was a bit annoying. Nonetheless, the postman did improve overtime in the movie's character development arc. However, the third act break up trope seem a bit overdramatic and harsh. Without spoiling this holiday picture too much, what he did wasn't really that awful. The other characters were doing similar things such as Alva (Voiced by Rashida Jones) a teacher turn fishmonger. It felt a bit out of character for her to get angry about his initially selfish plans when Alva was trying to leave the city at one time as well. She was really hesitant about wanting to teach the children even when they started to show up at her school. For her to turn her back on him felt like the pot calling the kettle black. It made no sense. As for Klaus (Voiced by J.K Simmons). He's no saint too. Forcing another person to break and enter houses at night rather than talking to the parents about the gifts is pretty bad enough. Yet as a woodsman who probably first arrive in the island port. He had to know that the whole town of Smeerensburg was involved in a generations old feud between two families that leads to lots of resentment. Also, I doubt he is that self-efficient. He has a lot of metal works, materials and tools in his workshop that wasn't made from his hands. He had to trade with somebody that wasn't Saami at one time for certain goods. After all his location is on the map. Regardless he still sometime in the past left the village to its own devices and selfishly move to isolate with his wife in the mountains. Because of that, he shouldn't gotta mad at Jesper too. That postman gave his life some new direction and purpose. Regardless the movie does a good job promoting moving past grudges and showing the importance of generosity, compassion, and teamwork. As the saying goes a true selfless act always sparks another. Even if the children are only acting good to get toys. As for the critics who be mad about this film deceiving children into believing falsehoods as it interferes with the development of critical thinking. Surprising for most of the runtime, the movie gives realistic explanations to a lot of the Santa Claus magical lore. Yet the ending gives into the idea that the supernatural might be in played. While the ascending to a higher plane of existence idea was well done for a children's movie. I just don't know if the film would had been stronger if Jesper took the mantle and continue the traditions that he founded with Klaus rather than waiting for his friend or not. Still the ending we got was a lot better than the delete version of them leaving everything for the North Pole. Hate for Jesper to lose everybody he grew to like. Truth be told he has more connection with the town folks rather than Klaus which kinda was a bit lacking. While I did love JK's limited voice acting in this film. The large amount of silence and grunts kinda hurt his character a bit. Schwartzman as Jesper was a little bit better as he added some child-like well balance snarky spoil brat charm with his adlibs. I don't think this would have work with the original chimney cleaner rags to riches plans. As for the mature posh English accent from the 2015 teaser. That's just jarring and doesn't fit with the younger man proving himself story that they were going for. Still the filmmakers made the right choices there along with keeping Norm McDonald as the wise cracking ship captain Mogens and having a real Saami girl Neda Margrethe Labba voiced the very cute Margu. Another thing this movie had going for it was its music. Singer Zara Larsson theme song ""Invisible"" was very uplifting and memorable. While composer Alfonso G. Aguilar score was emotional haunting. It was also easy on the ears. As for the visuals. The film was developed for nearly ten years, all because the studio wanted to create a new form of hand-drawn animation to keep the medium alive in the age of CGI. They got their wish as a paperless software was made that masterfully blend 2D with realistic 3D lightning and shading. The results were very crisped. It works amazing with the dark physical sardonic comedy. No wonder why this movie was nominated for Academy Award in 2020. Overall: I have to say this quirky take on Santa Claus's humble beginnings barely had anything really wrong to go postal about. In the end, it's nearly a total package. A must watch during the holidays.",

The pacing of the film is excellent, not too much in depth character development save a few characters but they all work well together, I love the contrasting personalities of Jesper and Klause and how it compliments them becoming friends.

55,11 January 2020,ajzeg,9, Only Netflix would have the guts to put out a hand-drawn animated film in 2019.,"This Santa Claus origin movie is awesome! It's heartwarming, original (for the most part, there were some elements that reminded me a little of The Emperor's New Groove or Megamind), funny and the animation is amazing! If I could describe it, well, do you remember the Disney short Paperman? You know, the one where they shaded CGI animation to make it look hand-drawn? Well, Klaus is the opposite. It's hand-drawn animation that is shaded to look like CGI. I've never seen this style before and it looks great! It's so colourful and well-designed. The voice acting and the writing is really damn good too! Honestly, there are only a couple issues I have. Some of the music choices and what little CGI this movie does use seem out-of-place, but other than that this might be the best Christmas movie since Arthur Christmas. It's certainly the year's best animated movie, and the best animated movie in general since Into the Spider-verse. Give it a watch with the family, it's really delightful!",

57,28 December 2019,Martinito_08183,7," A heartwarming, charming and gorgeous animated movie.","A heartwarming, charming and gorgeous animated movie that retells Santa Clause's origin story in a new and interesting way, although it does stumble in some places, especially with it's familiar story that we've experienced before and hitting most of the same beats (but that doesn't mean that it didn't had great moments); some of the characters needed more development (like the schoolteacher Alva, who unfortunately comes out as a generic love interest, while still shines in some moments throughout the story), while others (the villains) can be considered average at best; music, which was 30% great, while the other 70% didn't stand out all that much or the composer is repeating the same music a couple of times and the dialogue was great and in some moments OK at best, which included jokes that weren't all that funny.",
58,15 November 2019,cesar_augusto,10, 4 years waiting for a Masterpiece,"And thats my understatement for the year. I remember seeing the movie's test trailer and was FASCINATED by the beautiful animation. So I waited, followed the studio, the development, the videos they posted, became overjoyed by seeing netflix picking it up for production and when the time came, I sat down, closed the curtains, and started the movie.
Every moment of the movie, I was like ""this animation..."" because... yea, it's the crown jewel of this movie, the reason I was so hyped to see it, the animation is BEYOND GORGEOUS! Hands down a perfect hand-drawn animation by a Disney veteran and expert character designer with a team of the best he could get on a small scale. This movie feels like every one involved with it loved their job. The backgrounds, the movements, the lighting, oh sweet gingerbread, the lighting was just amazing. Every shade, hue and colour was just GLOWING and every background could be framed on a wall. The story itself is really fun, they didn't hold back on how the characters move, sound and interact with each other, the plot itself was quite fun and worked out the emotions just in the right way. The pop song felt a bit cheap, but hey, product of it's time, at least it wasn't distractive.
The ending got me a bit teary, it felt bittersweet for a moment, but then it threw that christmas warmth over me.
The characters, IMO were all likeable. Jesper is a fun, quick-paced nitwit that reminds me a lot of Kuzco from The Emperor's new Groove (down to the voice actor sounding startling similar to David Spade!), Klaus is a stoic, large figure with a little bit of sadness but plenty of space for joy, and J. K. Simons was a amtch made in heaven for that. The side characters were also lovely, especialy the antagonists. The movie also worked perfectly the subtle colour palette between the clans to make it pretty visible which citizen was from which clan (and I loved that paralel dialogue of the clan's history) and the character design was superb. Each character brimmed with personality and had a very original shape, outline and animation so they stand out in the crowd. In sum, this wasa holiday experience I didn't even know I needed so much, and another investment in animation that Netflix have done right. Keep up the good work, all of you. And I expect this old art to maybe find itself back into our lives, as a true act of kindness, always sparks another.",
59,16 November 2019,sskoul,9, A Muslim's take on Klaus (2019),"I am a Muslim and I don't believe in Santa but I definitely believe in ""A true selfless act always sparks another"" and I definitely can relate to the joy the heart experiences when you make an unknown person, specially a child happy. Thank you Klaus (2019) for pushing that message across. In a world drenched in bloodshed and hate, that is a much needed therapy for all of us. I am sorry I can not rate and give 10 stars as only real life itself can get 10/10. So you will have to settle with second place. Only 9 stars for you and lots of love. Peace and Allah u Akbar!",

61,17 December 2019,perica-43151,8, Original alternative Santa origins story,"The story of Santa origin centered around Scandinavia, and their dark mentality and centuries old feuds. A postman comes to North and accidentally starts a Christmas tradition, first for the feuding Scandinavian locals, and then also for a Mongoloid Sami girl, who brings Santa helpers. Legend origins are given humorous interpretations, and the sappy message about spreading good deeds is hammered with little subtlety. Still, a decent animation with extra points for originality, showing how easy it is to reverse engineer narratives using alternative facts and logic.",

65,11 February 2020,jboothmillard,8, Klaus,"I usually feel weird when I see or hear anything Christmassy before or after late November or December, but with this English-language Spanish Netflix made cartoon movie getting attention during Awards Season, I was prepared to make an exception and it watched it in early February. Basically, set in the 19th century, Jesper Johansson (Jason Schwartzman) is the lazy and spoiled son of a wealthy Postmaster General. He is enrolled into the postman training academy; his father hopes to reform him. But Jesper deliberately underperforms, forcing his father to give him an ultimatum. He is tasked with delivering six-thousand letters within a year, on the distant island town of Smeerensburg. If Jesper fails, he will be cut off from the family estate. On his arrival, he meets sarcastic ferryman Mogens (Norm Macdonald) and bitter teacher-turned-fishmonger Alva (Rashida Jones). Jespers finds out that most of the town's populace is made up of the Ellingboes and the Krums, two warring families, along with many other miserable people who hardly exchange words, let alone letters. For some time, he tries desperately to find a way to post letters but finds no mail to be collected from any of the houses on the island. But then on the map in his office Jesper notices that there is an isolated dwelling at the far end of the island. He travels there and discovers a reclusive woodsman named Klaus (J.K. Simmons) with a house filled with handmade toys. Jesper is terrified by the large man with a big white beard and flees, inadvertently leaving behind a sad drawing he took earlier made by one of Smeerensburg's children. Klaus forces Jesper to lead him to the boy's house depicted in the drawing, and then makes Jesper secretly deliver a toy to the boy inside. Word of this event spreads to other children, each believe that they will receive a toy if they send a letter, so they visit Jesper the next day. He capitalises on the idea and goes to Klaus to propose he donates his variety of toys; Klaus agrees on the condition that they operate at night, and that Jesper continues to deliver the toys in secret. Soon, more and more children begin writing letters to Klaus. Jesper decides not to give a child known for misbehaviour and bullying no toy, instead leaving a lump of coal. He tells the children that Klaus only gives toys to good children, he says that Klaus always knows when any child misbehaves, and he has a ""naughty list"". The acts of kindness that follow inspire the rest of the townsfolk to end their ancient disputes, and Alva reopens her school to help the children learn to read and write. Eventually, Jesper and Klaus begin running out of toys to give to the children. With the end of the year and Jesper's deadline coming up, he tries persuading Klaus into making more toys in time for Christmas. There is a misunderstanding between Klaus and Jesper, after which they reconcile, and they work together to make a sled for a small S√°mi girl named M√°rgu (Neda Margrethe Labba), who lives in an isolated settlement with her people. Klaus finally opens up to Jesper, he tells him about his wife Lydia, explaining he made the toys to give to children the couple hoped to have but never did, and Lydia eventually died from illness. Klaus has realised their work has been spreading joy to the children and agrees to the Christmas plan. As the town and his relationship with Alva flourishes, Jesper finds himself wanting to stay in Smeerensburg. Family elders Aksel Ellingboe (Will Sasso) and Tammy Krum (Joan Cusack) want to resume the traditional feuding, they form a temporary truce in order to stop Jesper and Klaus. They trick Jesper's father into coming to the island, made to believe Jesper has posted fourteen-thousand letters, he arrives on Christmas eve to congratulate his son, inadvertently revealing to Jesper's friends the selfish reasons for his deeds. Just as they are about to leave town, Jesper's father notices his son's remorse, and after a talk he allows Jesper to stay in Smeerensburg. The elders and their gang chases after Klaus travelling with a sleigh filled with wrapped Christmas gifts. Jesper tries to stop them and apparently fails. The elders leave believing they have destroyed the toys and restored traditions to the town, however Alva had been informed of the plot by the town's children, so she and Klaus had already replaced the toys with decoys. Jesper is redeemed, and Smeerensburg becomes a happy town, with the family elders being forced to end the family feuding due to the marriage of their children, Mr. Ellingboe's daughter and Mrs. Krum's son. Jesper marries Alva and raises two children, and he and Klaus continue to deliver presents in Smeerensburg and beyond for eleven years. On the twelfth year, Klaus follows a gust of a wind calling him and disappears, seemingly to join his departed wife. Every Christmas Eve from then on, Jesper sits beside the fireplace and sees the spirit of Klaus continues to deliver toys to children around the world. Also starring Sergio Pablos (the director, writer and producer) as Pumpkin / Olaf and The A-Team's Dwight Schultz as Additional Adults Voices. This is a terrific alternative story of the origins of Santa Claus, with a postman deep in the Arctic Circle that, with the help of a toymaker brings joy to a cheerless community, and everything you may expect is covered, from reindeer pulling a sleigh, to children being naughty and nice. It also has a great cast of actors as the voices, and the animation is of course impeccable, it is a little darker than traditional Christmas movies, but that actually makes it more interesting, and it does warm the heart at the right moments, it is a worthwhile seasonal animated comedy-drama. It won the BAFTA for Best Animated Featured Film, and it was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film. Very good!",

Klaus is one more attempt to put a new spin on the legend. However, the plot is all built around a spoiled young mailman who is seeking a way back into the lap of luxury that his father provides. I did not understand how this was all going to come around to Santa, and at one point I thought it would not, just assuming I was mistaken about its subject matter. But when it transitioned to the main part of the plot, I was impressed with the way this film took ideas that seem fantastical and gave a real world explanation for them. It was such a charming and different way of approaching the various stories about Saint Nick that we've all come to know. It grounded something that is magical, and I appreciated the way it pulls that off without stomping on the legends for any young kids watching.",

Animated in a beautiful 2D-esque style that uses 3D CGI as its base, Klaus works backward from what we understand as the current lore surrounding Santa Claus and develops a heartwarming story to explain all the little impossibilities that tie to the Yule tradition. And while it hits mostly predictable story beats, certain moments had me tearing up.",

75,15 January 2020,andrewroy-04316,9," An absolute joy from start to finish, Klaus is heart warming and has great messages","I truly can't imagine anyone not being invested in and uplifted by watching Klaus. The plot has enough going on and the pace is swift enough to leave no lulls in the movie, and it is a film that everyone can enjoy (a daunting challenge). The heart of the story is easy for young kids to understand, but even the use of simpler tropes in the movie are referenced as clever meta humor so that no elements feel stale to adults. The development of Jesper and his goal is a perfect representation of one of the main messages: early on, it's a fun adventure to reach 6,000 letters, but you quickly see the effect he's having on the town and how his priorities shift. His realization that while his old life is materially appealing, it truly doesn't compare in satisfaction to his new life because what matters is really what he can do for others and the people he loves. Life doesn't need to fit an expected mold, but can be something freeing and unexpected. Klaus is a great character and a very fun origin for Santa, and Alva's transformation to loving teaching the kids was great. Their romance was great because while it was fitting, it wasn't played overly dramatically but presented as a natural occurrence, which was refreshing. The two moments where Jesper makes the plan to get the letters and then tells the mean kid about the naughty list followed by rap music playing were both hilarious. The animation is great, particularly in how the town transitions from gray to light over time. The climax and ending are great, with plenty of tension but a purely joyful finish. This is a wonderfully made family film full of heart.",

81,3 December 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7, An early Christmas present.,"'Klaus (2019)' is essentially a demystified 'Santa Claus' origin story and it's as formulaic as you'd, perhaps, expect. It's also just delightful. Its predictability can't prevent it from being good and, boy, is it good. It's an enjoyable, effective and visually striking animation with a kind heart and a gentle spirit. It sidesteps the sloppy sentimentality usually associated with 'Christmas' movies in favour of, essentially, a subtler sort of the same thing. Its 'Christmas spirit' is strong but well-earned, sweet but not sickly. The movie is just a joy, in general. It's fun, fast-paced and aesthetically distinct, brought to life with a beautiful 2D-3D blend. It doesn't feel entirely typical, either, thanks to its endearingly strange setting and relatively well-realised characters. It makes a couple of very minor missteps - such as a second-act lull in pace and a slightly odd ending - but it's ultimately a thoroughly entertaining experience. 7/10",

112,23 November 2019,theredsky,9, Klaus Review,"Most of this year's Netflix releases have been bland and boring but I'm glad to say that Klaus is the exact opposite. I am confident in saying that this could become a Christmas classic although I had some issues that are common in Christmas related films. The story is a little simplistic. I know that it's more for children but I wish that these stories had a little more depth and more ideas presented. Even though the story is simplistic, it is still engaging. I was never bored throughout the course of the film and I was always interested in the characters and what they were doing. For a Christmas film, the characters are pretty good. The villains are kind of boring but the rest of the characters have their own interesting arc that they go through. This is boosted by some great voice acting from Jason Schwartzman, Rashida Jones, and J.K. Simmons who plays Klaus in the movie. Simmons gives the best performance in the film by far. Jason Schwartzman does a pretty good job although he was given a Christmas cliche that did annoy me. It's the standard cliche of a character has different motives that change before the end and has a misunderstanding with the other characters who ignore him. That happens in this film and it was a little obnoxious. Some of the music choices were pretty weird too. They decided to create an original song for the film and it didn't fit it that well in my opinion. The animation is beautiful in Klaus. It's all hand drawn animation and it reminded me of classic Disney films. The design of the town was pretty great and interesting with all these different characters doing different things. There were some jokes thrown into the film and some of them weren't that funny but the funniest ones were the jokes you can see in the background. All of these little visual cues were hilarious in my opinion. There is a lot of heart to this film. I was surprised at how much joy I felt when watching this and the ending was fantastic. It's sad and joyful at the same time. This is a film I will probably start watching every Christmas. It's a satisfying origin story to Santa Claus. Overall, Klaus may be a little too simplistic with weird music choices but its heart, animation, and voice acting make this an instant Christmas classic.",

118,30 December 2019,ofpsmith,9, Lovable Santa origin story.,The Santa Claus origin story isn't necessarily a new thing but Klaus seems to be one of the more inventive ways it's been done. The story takes place in the 19th century in what appears to be a country in Northern Europe (likely Norway). Jesper Johanssen (Jason Schwartzman) is the lazy and unambitious son of the Postmaster General who is stationed to the remote and unpleasant town of Smeerensburg as punishment for his poor work ethic as a mailman in training. Jesper arrives in a town long torn apart by a rivalry between two families and is simply looking for a way out until he chances upon Klaus (J.K. Simmons) the lonely and reclusive lumberman who likes outside the town. As Jesper needs to reach a quota of delivered letters before he is allowed to leave Smeerensburg he begins mailing letters from children to Klaus who begins delivering presents to the children of Smeerensburg. Soon the longstanding sectarianism between the two families begins to fade. I really enjoyed this story and found it a clever and inventive take on how Santa Claus came to be. The animation was very pretty and it just had an all around good feeling about it. Klaus comes highly recommended for children and adults.,

I had read and heard so many good things about this one and all of it was well deserved. What a wonderful film, the animation has that classic touch to it, and the story is original and heartwarming. A new twist to Santa's origin story with this one and I absolutely love it. It's heartbreakingly realistic, yet magical. I love the character of Klaus and when it's time to join his wife on the other side, the tears just started streaming down. The final line that Jesper says that he gets to see his best friend once every year, it just shattered my heart into a million pieces (in a good way).",

How does Santa's tradition of giving gifts to children on this day come? This movie is composed of such a story, the key is that the story is compiled as it is, with all its heads and ends, and complete. Santa is a single old man who has lost his wife and no children and loves to make toys. When he was alive, he sent toys to the children in the town with the postman. After he died, he became a Santa Claus and gave the toys to children all over the world. The origin of Santa Claus turned out to be such a sad and touching movie.",

The main character Jesper is a failing post man who gets sent through a trial to become the post man his father always believed he could be. But he stumbles upon an old run down house which is owned by Klaus. They both find the love and passion for giving instead of getting. This movie is about the birth of Santa Klaus, from the gifts to the naughty and nice list etc. this movie just explores it all and in a such a great way too. This movie really warmed up my heart, it's been a long time since we got a good old Christmas movie, and this film delivered. There is a sad part at the end of the movie which creates the imagination of Santa Klaus that children still believe in today. He comes every year, so you best be in bed.",

140,11 December 2019,outbreak-68249,10, One of my favorite movies,No Christmas qualifier here. Just one of my favorite movies period. Excellent story and animation. My wife does 3d animation and I usually get to hear about all the mistakes or shortfalls in animated movies and she didn't say one thing the entire film. Excellent character growth all around. The story is a classic but it is an original take with a bittersweet semi ambiguous ending that leaves the idea of santa Klaus up to the viewer. At it's heart it is a story about giving and selflessness which is the core of the season for many people. Cannot recommend this film enough.,

146,21 March 2020,Diablo1616,8, This movie is beautiful! As a Netflix Christmas special.,"Why Klaus Is Amazing
Even before one word of dialogue has been said you can already tell that you are in for a treat, the animation and artwork for this movie is absolutely gorgeous and it helps the visual storytelling by a lot. Before knowing what's going on the art shows us we are in a timeless land and that this is a remodeling of the old Christmas story of Santa. The actual plot is amazing, it takes many cliches but makes it work in a way where they actually work as good storytelling devices. Every single detail and point made in the story equal to amazing results and quality. The new take on Mr. Klaus was wonderfully done and with the addition of the art design it helped all the audience to feel like a kid again, everything that was once magical IS magical still. I dont believe I have ever seen a movie that told the story of Christmas in a new way and actually worked as an amazing piece of art. The length that this story goes with its new Santa is done magnificently, making him a regular human (or so we thought) not only made us connect with him more but also made us smile like kids to know that this man is Santa. The main character of the story Jesper Johanna is a regular post office man who helps create the Santa story, making him come up with the naughty list and the giving children toys on Christmas thing was such a wonderful surprise. Because we love this character we don't mind him changing the story, although it did bother me at first that Santa wasn't just a magical being, the ending made me really wonder ""was he really not magical? Or did I just not notice"" the way they humanize him is truly incredible. The wind as a symbolic reference to Santa's past lover is a cliche but works so well in the story that it doesn't take anything away and just adds even more. The wind being symbolic for Santa's wife and the wind moving through the snow, (which is connected to Santa because it represents Christmas which he holds dear to his heart) just creates even more amazing symbolism. The ending was amazing and really was an unexpected tear-jerker.",

This movie is really wholesome and such a touching story about another origin of Santa Claus.

169,18 February 2020,classicsoncall,7," ""Why, it's not every day they get a brand new postman from the big city!""","Here's a re-imagining of the holiday tradition of Santa Claus and how he came to deliver Christmas presents to good little boys and girls. I got a kick out of the 'lump of coal' treatment for those who didn't toe the line with their parents. I don't know how long that's been a troublesome mainstay, but it was well in place some sixty odd years ago when I was looking for gifts under the Christmas tree. The story starts out as a bit of a competition when a young layabout named Jesper Johannson (voiced by Jason Schwartzman) is assigned the task of achieving a goal of six thousand letters sent from the island outpost of Smeerensburg. Initially hitting the proverbial brick wall in a town of feuding families, Jesper is handed a lifeline when a burly widowed carpenter named Klaus (voiced by J.K. Simmons) decides to mail one of his many home made toys to an unfortunate young lad of the town. The idea snowballs, so to speak, and soon, all the kids in town are writing letters to Klaus to let him know how obedient and well mannered they were all year. With colorful animation in what I like to call a sort of wood-block style, ""Klaus"" is a fine, family friendly Christmas film that will join the ranks of other holiday movies as an annual event. In fact, after only three months since it's release in November, 2019 (as I write this), it rates a number five position in my list of IMDb viewer rated Christmas movies, joining 1966's ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" (#3) and the prior year's ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" (#4) in the Top Five. So a word of advice to future film makers, when it comes to Christmas. clever and original animated pictures seem to be the ticket.",

The fact that they made a 2D movie in such a way that you think it's 3D is so impressive. With that alone, this movie would already stand out. But even if it were animated normally, this movie is fantastic. First of all, it's a great Christmas movie, with messages about the importance of kindness and good will. The ""Changes"" scene, in particular, where you see the town transform, is flawless, how one little thing can change everything. Second of all, it's hilarious. Jason as Jesper is great, Norm as the boatman is great, and even the clans are funny. Third of all, it's such a heartwarming story. The character arcs of Klaus and Jesper, as well as the way they intertwine with each other, are perfect. Overall, this movie deserves the title of ""magical"" and is the perfect movie to watch for Christmas, or at any other time.",
183,3 January 2020,Harhaluulo54,5, The cliches bring down the occasional brilliance and turn the movie into mediocrity,"The quirks, the wits, and the clear self-awareness in writing carry the movie a long way, but the massive amount of cliches and shameless use of one-dimensional ""bad guys"" in the narrative made the work seem less genuine than it otherwise could have been. The brilliant reflections that characters go thru during the run are surprisingly well-planned and executed, but then again, those overly gimmicky tropes in the plot make it seem like the writer was talented enough to avoid them and create something more original and sincere, but just decided not to. Very weird decisions were made here and I cannot fully approve them. An okay movie but nothing more.",

'Joker'-- Why a movie is of any good if I knew all it had to say before I even see it? Until, I watched'Klaus', one of the best movies in years and one of the best Christmas movie or animation ever made.
For two hours, I couldn't calm myself down from the pure childish joy after surprised and thrilled, multiple times, by this masterpiece. Great original story, solid characters, beautiful music, and an impeccable finish with a brave end.
Decades we've been feeling awful for lying to our children about Santa, and finally we have a real story to tell about a toy maker and his postman friend, and how Christmas truely began.

A true act of good will always sparks another. Hope this inspire.",
187,18 December 2019,shimenpf,7, Fun and sweet,"This is the kind of Christmas movie that I feel was so much needed. A sweet animated comedy that evokes emotions and entertains the audience from beginning to end.
The movie has great characters with which it's easy to empathize. The plot is nicely intertwined with the subplots (Alva and her school, the villains and their evil plot, Klaus' internal struggle). The character arcs are solid, the theme is communicated in an effective way and the story is very solid, particularly the second act, which is where most movies fall.
There's a small twist after the presents are lost where it turns out those were fake presents. I think it would've been more satisfying if that had been previously set-up in some way. I also feel there was a beat missing in Alva and Jesper's relationship, after he comes back, some sort of apology to her.

232,17 November 2019,barnandkaren,7, Klaus is good; once it gets going.,"The main aspect of this movie that always amazes me whenever I watch it is the animation. The animation in this movie is just so gorgeous to look at and you can tell the animators put so much thought into how they wanted it to look. There aren't that many animated movies that have this kind of look to them and it really reminds me of an old children's book. The animation here is unique in that this movie is a hand-drawn animated movie but through the power of lighting, everything looks and feels 3D. One of the biggest things I noticed in this movie was the lighting and how well it was used. The lighting in every scene helped the audience get a feel for the environment or how a character was feeling at that certain moment. I especially love comparing the lighting for the town of Smeerensburg from the start of the movie to the ending. When we first see the town it's hidden away in a thick fog to where you can't see anything and whatever you do see is dreary to look at. Whereas in the end everything is bright and colourful and it's easy to see everything in the small town. This perfectly shows the change that's happened to this town that once was at each other's throats and now live in harmony with one another. When it comes to the lighting of the characters the best example is Klaus. Klaus is usually seen in darker lighting when we the audience don't fully know him and what exactly his story is but once we learn more about him we see him in brighter lighting.",

The movie keeps on knodding you that Klaus is Santa, showing things like ""How the naughty list was made"" in the most creative ways. When in reality he's just a normal guy with a good heart.

Sadly, everything starts to fall apart about half way through where it becomes painstakingly clear how everything will turn out.

313,17 November 2019,Biligsaikhan,10, I will watch this every christmas with my kids,"The famous Christmas story is known to everyone. Santa Claus and the stories we hear from him are passed down from generation to generation, nurturing the imagination of every child, so Klaus seeks to tell something that doesn't escape reality so much but without missing magic in the story, in a different film than we see at the end of the year. What is most cool about the film is that he knows how to play with the myths of ""Old Man in Red"", the answers given for the formation of stories around this Christmas story are very interesting, and this is where the script that is written by also director of the film, Sergio Pablos, who conducts an ok beginning story, but which has a very good and fun growth. The characters are not spectacular but they have a good arc. One thing that I really liked was the choice to make an animation by hand, like in older films and that gives a certain nostalgia. Klaus plays on the Christmas myths, and gives a good insight into how the stories came about, it's fun and nostalgic.",

316,27 December 2019,phil_doucet,6, Made for kids and adults,Netflix created something special with this movie. Everything about the story is intriguing and entertaining. It's a very clever movie. The comedic factor is fantastic and it is a lot of fun watching how they connected the mythology of Santa Claus with this crazy story. The location is particularly interesting along with its feuding citizens. It's touching watching everyone come together as Klaus and the postman make such an impact with their kindness. It's a fun and creative Christmas story for the whole family. This is another example of an animated movie keeping things lighthearted for the kids while having moments of depth for the adults.,

The story and characters are also cute and charming so if you are fan of Christmas themed animations this is definitely a must see.,
324,6 September 2021,saraccan,7, Something different,"I really liked Klaus. It tells a wholesome story, it has likable characters, and has great art. The most remarkable part about Klaus was the art style. It took me a little while to get used it (since I'm so used to 3D), but once I adjusted, it was great. The characters are also very well done. There's some great character development, Klaus as a character is just so likable. I feel like the film rushed some parts, like Jesper and Klaus' friendship. They went from no communication to consistently exchanging dialogue. I feel like if the film was closer to two hours, then it would've fixed some of these issues. The comedy was also very funny, which completely caught me off guard. I don't really laugh to pg animated movies, but Klaus genuinely made me laugh. I'm between giving Klaus either a 7/10 or a 8/10. I think it's a 7.5; depending on my mood, it'll be an 8. But nonetheless, it's a great movie.",
325,6 April 2021,DeBBss,7, Unique in its own way,"Klaus. It only takes one good deed. One of the few Christmas cartoons that I liked so much. Klaus is a very kind (although there is violence) and warm film that should gather the whole family around it and make these one and a half hours pass in one breath. Klaus also shows that a very beautiful cartoon does not require animation like Disney or DreamWorks. Summing up, I would like to say a huge thank you to Sergio Pablos and the whole great team for creating such an amazing cartoon that I am sure I will watch more than once, and not necessarily at Christmas. P. S. Good always triumphs over evil.",

There are many places to explore
For example, two families who hate purely for hatred
Patriarch who maintains his position through hatred
The little girl with no language (Finnish is said to be few in China)
What is the original purpose and expectation of the protagonist's family to hone the protagonist?
What is the previous relationship between the protagonist's family and Claus",
336,19 May 2020,krational66,7, A lot of information.,"Christopher Vogler, the famous Disney story guru, says every good story has a One-Word Theme. What about KLAUS? And how does its OWT connect to the meaning of the Title and Hero's Name--the other two corners of what I call The Symbolic Triangle?",
337,18 December 2019,StoryArchitect,8, JOY STORY,"Spoiled rich kid Jesper (Jason Schwartzman) gets sent by his father to Smeerensberg, a remote island far north, a violent and hostile place where two feuding families rule the town, and use a battle bell (tied to a gallows) to start fighting. Eventually, Jesper meets a burly old woodsman named Klaus (JK Simmons), who looks a lot like Jethro from 'The Prince of Egypt', whom Jesper convinces to make toys to give to the town's children so that Jesper can turn a profit as a postman and get back home to his comfortable life. Of course, the two end up saving the town and Jesper starts to care and then the same old liar-revealed-and-redeemed plot happens.
The film is beautiful. The colours and the light are masterfully done.
Jesper reminds me somewhat of Gwizdo from 'Dragon Hunters'. Both are anti-heroes who are in it for the money but have hearts of gold buried underneath. However, Jesper is not very well designed. He looks like Dr. Doppler from 'Treasure Planet'. Gwizdo's design is more interesting in that his face is shorter and wider. Sometimes Jesper looks OK but then he starts grimacing and it becomes really unappealing. And while Jesper is a spoiled brat forced into a harsh work environment, Gwizdo grew up poor, is constantly broke and he and his buddy have to look for work where they can find it.
The other characters, however, have excellent designs. The leaders of the towns look really cool. There's a cute little girl who can only speak Saami. There's a predictable third act twist and a forced romance that doesn't work. Norm McDonald steals the show as Smeerensberg's savvy ferryman.
The film is rated PG and for a good reason. There are some dark and scary moments in the film, and quite a bit of dark comedy (again, there's a hanging joke, but with a bird house instead of a birdcage, or rather a scallop cage). Usually these days 'PG' means ""Practically G"" so this is a surprise.
Ultimately, this is a very poignant film about an unlikely friendship. I recommend it.",

341,19 November 2019,aqibhakro,8, Movie About Revolution!!,"""Klaus"" is another take on the legend of Santa Claus but it hasn't a ""I've already seen it"" type of taste. The movie is technically excellent with a great direction, a magnificent photography and a beautiful music. But the best things are the concept design (that is so important for an animated movie) and the animation itself. Indeed almost every fun moment of the movie is of physical comedy but it works so well thanks to the animator that did a great job. The film is very funny and colourful but it has some touching moments too and it has a beautiful message for the kids but most importantly for the adults, in particular for those who grew up with some form of anger or resentment. And for these reasons ""Klaus"" is a very very good animated feature, I think it will become one of my Christmas classics!",

343,17 November 2019,michaelsmith-82518,9, Wonderful,"""Klaus"" is beyond a Christmas animation movie. I started watching it as a professional. As an animator i decided to watch it for the new techniques they used for creating it, but soon i forgot to follow what and how they did it. I was immersed in this amazing world that was created on screen. I was again a little girl watching a fairy tale. Everything from the story, trough the character and background designs, music score and the new techniques that were used for creating this animation makes it a masterpiece.
In times when the big animation film studios are too busy with corporate stuff and merchandising and broadcasting everything they spit, Sergio Pablos and his studio ""Spa Stuidios"" with the help of Netflix create an actual good animation movie. A movie which is not all about political correctness, but a animation for THE CHILDREN. A pure joy for the viewers, a movie that pretty much resembles the old animation classics. So thank you Sergio Pablos for bringing back the joy of watching animations! Thank you for bringing back the 2D animation to life.

And this film is about a son of a wealthy postmaster general who after trying to reform his lazy, spoiled son with several attempts, finally decides to send him to a cold, unlovable town on an island called Smeerensburg as a postman, to let him learn a lesson to straighten his irresponsibleness, and that all of the townsfolk and kids slowly mend their ways, inspired by an old toymaker who happens to be our dear old Santa Klaus.",

""Less presents, less weight"" is one abhorrent example. Fewer presents, less weight. If you're going to get all preachy about social problems, then maybe don't add to the mis-education of children. Also, the animation style where the characters are all grossly out of proportion is just that: gross.",

383,30 December 2019,kfilippopoulou,10, Santa origins,"This is a very good movie. I started watching expecting an 8/10 movie, and I got an 8/10 movie! This film is about a guy named Jesper who is very lazy and spoiled, so his dad sends him to a town way up north called Smeerensburg to teach him a lesson. That is all I will say about this movie because I want you to experience it with as few spoilers as possible. This movie, while not hilarious, is very funny and has some recurring jokes that are hard to notice, but when you do they are funny, and you feel proud for noticing them even if they are somewhat easy to spot. This movie is very consistently good, and I could see why this had such great reviews from the start but it started getting better around an hour in, and by then I agreed with all the reviews. I have a few complaints, like how a couple of parts in the 3rd act don't make sense but the rest of the 3rd act makes up for that. The 3rd act is almost always my favorite part of any movie but for this movie, I would give that award to the 2nd act. This is a great Christmas movie, sadly I watched it on the 27th. 8.2/10.",

387,15 December 2019,totti-87315,10, I am the Grinch of Xmas movies but this one is AMAZING,"This movie is fantastic! The story is great, the voice acting is superb, but most importantly we get to see what amazing things you can still do with hand drawn animation in the era of cgi. Using computer lighting techniques over traditional animation is a brilliant way to win over the Pixar or nothing crowd by blending traditional animation with modern computer wizardry. But most importantly it's hand drawn... by actual human hands... the way the nine old men would have done it! You get that personal touch that you only get when someone is actually producing artwork and not just connecting vector dots on a computer screen. It's a special kind of warm fuzzy magic that just isn't common place in American animated films anymore. Of course this film isn't American, Sergio Pablos took what he learned working on films like Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame and created his own studio in Spain to create this masterpiece. This film is a Christmas classic, a great Santa origin story, but it's much more than that, it's a true marvel of modern artistry seemlesly blending the old with the new to create something incredible.",
388,26 November 2021,brianjfichtner,10, A beautiful return to hand drawn animation.,"We just happened to come across this on Netflix and gave it a try. Very quickly it moves from ""oh here's ANOTHER cutesy animated film trying desperately to contrive feelings of Christmas magic"" to ""Oh my gosh, this is hilarious!"" This movie is genuinely funny, excellently illustrated and quite possibly the most original Santa Claus story I've ever seen. The character of Klaus as this massively manly woodsman living out in the cold backwoods and friends only with the wildlife was so cool! The story of the fighting villagers was so full of little funny details and had my wife and I literally laughing out loud. It also has some heart wrenching moments that I won't spoil here.",

The film creates a rich and exciting world, filled with unique situation and twists to the original tale. But then, it seems the creators didn't know what to do with the story in order to give it a unique meaning to match, so they just forced a development full of clich√©s: the MC taking dumb decisions, miscomunication problems, a one-dimensional evil plot, chase scenes...All in order to give a lesson at the end which was already very clear before all that unnecessary mess.",

Not a big fan of Christmas movies because I'm not a Christian so I can never get into the ""spirit"" but this made me view it from a whole other perspective, it really goes deep into the real meaning of Christmas and not just lights and decorations and eye candy, Ive watched it twice already and I'm welling to do it again, aside from the stunning visuals & very catchy songs.
The idea of the movie is just so close to my heart, society especially children should not be suffering from old traditions & habits, and that idea was perfectly executed.

Rashida Jones and J. K. Simmons both did an excellent job. I especially loved Norm Macdonald as the boat man. I could definitely see Norm's personality poke through in his role.

In fact, all of Jasper's interactions were well developed and quite charming to witness as they helped him understand the main moral of the plot: the best things in life comes from the simplest things with friends and family. Much like Kuzco, Jesper turned from an arrogant, egotistical individual, to a lovable and kind-hearted person who is willing to devote his time to make children happy in an otherwise miserable place. Some other characters like Alva was also quite the interesting individual. Add the impeccable performances, like Oscar-winning J.K.

Maybe you still think about the fact that your target audience was from the majority of the population? A great story that touches the soul and touches the soul. At first glance, an unpretentious plot, but ... Shows how much children lack kindness from adults who project their displeasure on them.

Every scene in it made me emotional, and its story? A damn fine one, filled with wholesome, heart-touching, and emotional scenes. The character progression of Jesper, a spoilt brat, whose father is also the Post Master General of the main town in the movie, was also documented well throughout the movie from reflecting his desperation to go back home to his comfortable, lazy life to displaying how he made friends with the old Toy-Maker Klaus, and the school teacher Miss Alva. As the movie progresses, we can observe that even though Klaus and Alva are somewhat hostile towards Jesper, they join forces together to bring sanity and peace to the rotten feudal town of Smeerensburg, bringing smile to the face of little children living there.",

I just finished watching Klaus and I have 4 words to say for this film: ""JOY TO THE WORLD!"" This film is a true Christmas film. Voice acting was awesome. Story was good, except for one part where it was kind of tropey.
I love the characters, especially the main characters. Jesper reminded me of Kuzco from ""Emperor's New Groove"" in the beginning, Alva I love and adore so much, and Klaus was a strong-hearted character.
Also, there was one scene that got me so emotional and was my absolute favorite part in the whole movie. It was the scene where M√°rgu received her parasled (parasailing sled). I nearly cried when that happened.
Last, the animation was the stand out of this entire film. Everything from its location shots to its character designs. It was all on point.
The only negatives that I would say for Klaus is other than that one tropey part in the climax of the film. There were a couple songs that were somewhat out of place. Overall, I give Klaus a 9.25/10.",

Rather than portraying certain ideas just for the sake of telling it Klaus shows the solution on how to make it happen. The animation is nostalgic, colorful, and fresh.

Christmas films always get that cheese factor baked in but hell, if it didn't it'd be an ordinary movie. The Disney like 2D animation with 3D light is stunning. The characters are immense.

697,16 November 2019,miguelarj-91,10, It will warm your heart in this cold Winter,"This was hands down the best animated movie I have seen in ages. It was beautiful, every single character had their own odd personality to them, someone did a bloody good job on the layout of each scene (my jaw was hanging 2 cm below normal for the first 10 minutes), and the story even though it is the umpf-teenth version of Santas story, was original. Excellent writing as well as screenplay.
Because of the lighting I was convinced it was pure 3d-animation, which would make saying I was impressed the understatement of the year (given that we are at the end of it, that should say something). I read that it was 2d animation but cgi lighting later, and didn't care. This is the best 2d animation since Disney stopped doing what they were best at. In fact I strongly suspect some former Disney animators here since Disney no longer employs any to my knowledge. This is what 2d animation can do, which 3d, while able to do tons in its own right, has yet to accomplish: caricature. This is what Disney should still be doing instead of re-making their best work in 3d. Thank you to every single person who worked on Klaus and to Netflix for picking up the production from all of us who miss the classically 2d-animated movies.",

744,1 December 2019,innordicmedia,10, This is what christmas is...,"Jesper is a spoiled son of the Post Master General, he only cares about himself and living a comfortable life. His father to teach him a lesson in humility and the value of hard work sends him to the town of Smeerensburg. In this town abides two rival families that have been in conflict since before anyone can remember. they don't know why, they just know that they don't like each other. Jesper has been given the task that if he can deliver a certain amount of letters he will be able to return home. The problem is that because everyone disdains one another, no one will ever send a letter. All of that changes when though a series of events Jesper helps a woodsman named Klaus give a toy to a little boy. Jesper uses this opportunity to manipulate the children into sending letters to Klaus so that he will send them a toy. Through this experience Jesper learns that ""An act of good will inevitably sparks another"". A great message but unfortunately not executed perfectly. You see because Jesper tells the children that if they aren't good that they won't get any toys, the kids begin doing good deeds around town and the town starts because a better and more friendly place to live. The elders of both families don't like this and plot to get rid of Jesper and spot Klaus from giving any more toy. They conclude that if they stop the toys from coming people will cease doing acts of good will. While the film has a happy ending it never really disproves this theory. As Jesper says ""Everyone is out to get something"" he even uses the kids being good for toys as an example. While Jesper does become less selfish by the end of the film this objection is never really answered. Even Klaus and Jesper it could be argued have something to get out of the good tht they do, though it may be subjective. So is there anyone who has done an act of good will by pure motive. there is only one, Jesus Christ. Who left the glory of heaven, humbled himself to become a man and walk among us. Dies on the cross bearing our sins and being punished under the wrath of God that we as sinners deserve. On the 3rd day He rose again and he has done this to redeem a people who don't deserve it. He is the good will to men. Klaus is a wonderful film with great animation that I plan to watch every year as a Christmas tradition but it points me back to the true good will that came to men 2,000 years ago.

761,5 April 2020,svargaslogan,10, Remarkable movie,"To be honest..I just didn't expect this film to be such a pleasure to watch. It was like ""Netflix movie?? Ok lets try this"" and as usual Netflix didn't disappoint .
The animation is very much different from what we are used to watching. But it will give just a mind-blowing experience.
This story is more leaned towards a postman rather than the ""Klaus"" it self..
The story just tries to show us may be this is how all the concepts of Christmas and Santa Claus came..such as why he uses u raindeers..why use imagine him flying...and most importantly why he gives PRESENTS.
The music..the climax..the animation..the dubbing is extremely perfect
But..I think the ending could have been much more better and satisfying..
But still I would say that watching this Netflix movie is a mind-blowing experience",

If you've been forced to watch Mickey's Once Upon A Christmas or The Polar Express repeatedly, this will be something soothing and enjoyable!",

But then we've got a wonderful story about life of Santa Klaus. The movie story totally fits the original myths about Santa but without magic.

The viewing experience was just incredible. Wonderful animation, beautifully done. Nice story line. Would not recommend it for really young kids, thought. I consider this to be a rather PG movie since some of the scenes are darker than what you would expect in a children movie. Having said that, I consider this to be one of the best animation movies I have seen in a long time. It is a testament of what can be done when you are not tight to a Disney-like producing machine.",

Every night I sit down with my 4 year old son and read a few books and watch a movie with him until Mom comes and takes him night night. Burnt out on Paw Patrol, Shaun the sheep etc... etc... I came to find the movie Klaus. I was instantly and pleasantly surprised by this movie. My wife came to get my son about 45 minutes into it and I paused the movie, said my good nights, and as he was being tucked in by Mom I continued watching the movie. This never happens! I usually just turn off T.V. but this animated movie had completely caught my attention. The storyline was amazing and there is no escaping the box of tissues or edge of your shirt in my case on the ending. In my opinion this movie will be a classic just like the old claymation Christmas movies.",
772,30 November 2020,jrciv-71831,10, Blown away Father over an animated Christmas movie.,"The movie hit on my emotions and I loved experiencing them all. Perhaps the scene that touched me the most was when Klaus followed the winter wind to meet his sweetheart. I've been married 35 years and I can't imagine my wife passing before me and having to wait to see her again. What a reunion that will be.
I loved the movie and can't wait for my children and grandchildren to see it. A Christmas tradition for sure.",

Man I absolutely loved it.",
779,5 March 2022,peytonxbaileyx,9, A cute and lovely little christmas movie,"From the very start it was obvious I'm looking at something very original. You would expect a Christmas cartoon to start somewhere cold and snowy, but no! It starts with a very simple mundane picture, and as the plot goes it turns into something absolutely magical. The story is especially relatable nowadays, when part of people became sad and depressed, mostly because the other part became cynical, always chasing profit and lacking kindness. And there sometimes seems to be nothing good left in this world. This cartoon has a soul, it speaks to those good people who search for light themselves. It shows you, that there is hope and kindness in this world, even if you don't believe in it yourself. Beautiful piece of art.",
