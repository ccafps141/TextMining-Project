0,5 December 2002,OttoVonB,10, The Most Quotable Film of All Time,"Those Coen brothers have an ear for language. You feel it in the sing-songy banalities of Fargo, and in the noiresque machine-gun dialogue of Miller's Crossing, but neither of these can prepare you for the feast for the ears that is The Big Lebowski.",/

2,24 February 1999,Coxer99,10, The Dude Abides!!!,"No movie has entertained me more in the last year than this film. It's delightfully written, directed with poise and acted with extravagance and excellence. I do admit that this is a film that I had to see six times to get. Every time I watch it I learn something new. The genius of the film lies within a game I think the Coen brothers play with their audiences. There are the touches of the masters in many of their films. In ""The Hudsucker Proxy,"" it was Preston Sturges and Frank Capra. In ""Raising Arizona,"" I felt a touch of Sam Fuller. In this film, I felt many touches of greatness, but more specifically I felt John Sayles or even John Cassevettes in spots. The camera was manipulated beautifully and I felt a tinge of their talents lurking in at many a turn. The performances are astounding, especially Goodman as the deranged bowler still living deep within the jungles of the Vietcong. Huddleston is also quite wonderful as the title character. Turturro gives a fine cameo as ""Jesus,"" coupled with a rousing and humurous version of the Eagles, ""Hotel California,"" done in Espanol. I hope this is a film that is looked at with more seriousness. It is, once you dig deep, a fine piece of filmmaking.",e
3,28 January 2010,planktonrules,9, A wonderful film...with the word f#@$ used 102030841 times!,"I tried watching this film on TV a few years ago, but I made the mistake of doing so with my kids nearby. In the first 10 minutes of so, I heard 'f#@$' (a word you are NOT allowed to use even once on IMDb) dozens of times. Realizing that the film was NOT family-friendly, I turned it off despite all the very positive reviews I'd read for it. However, considering I've seen all the Coen Brothers films except this one, I knew that eventually I'd get back to seeing it. Nearly a decade has passed, and I finally got around to seeing this cult favorite.",v

5,4 January 2015,Galina_movie_fan,10," It's good knowin' he's out there. The Dude. Takin' 'er easy for all us sinners.""","Looks like while making ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998)â€“ weird, nutty, outrageously funny and deliciously twisted movie, the brothers Ethan and Joel Coens, known for their unique and dry humor, sat back, laughed out loud, and had fun. ""Big Lebowski"" turned as one of the funniest comedies ever made. It is funny because of the incredibly off-beat characters, their weirdness, flaws, their interactions, the surreal situations they found themselves in, and perfectly written and delivered hilarious dialogs. There is the story, of course, which is based on the case of mistaken identity with the following kidnapping, villainous nihilists, vanguard erotic flying painter, the bowler named Jesus but the story is truly secondary to the delicious craziness of the movie.",e
6,28 March 2004,cleaf,10," You can watch it a million times, and yet, it will never get old","The Big Lebowski is the type of movie that is so funny, and so clever, you want nothing more but to meet the Coen brothers, congratulate them personally for their unique talent, and get inside their heads and find out what makes these two geniuses ""tick"".  The main characters are Jeff Bridges (who plays such broad roles like The Muse, The Contender, and Sea Biscuit), John Goodman (who should have won an oscar for best supporting actor for his character, Walter Sobchak)Juliane Moore (Maude Lebowski)and Steve Buscemi (who is unique in every Coen Brother movie).",w

My lady-friend's daughter is always telling her that she should see TBL in order to understand some of the ""in-humor"" and comments of her generation. I kept telling my friend that I really didn't think that the movie would be what she expected, but we watched it together anyway. (I had already seen it a couple times.) My friend was flabbergasted, as she couldn't identify any phrases, humorous scenes, or references that she had ever heard or seen her daughter's group use. She didn't like the movie, either, and was actually checking to make sure that it was the same movie her daughter had recommended.",/

He also noted that ""The Big Lebowski"" has developed a cult following. The interviewer added some praise. That, together with the high rating on IMDb, convinced me to give this a shot. ",r

Two thugs break in to shake him down and pee on his rug. They soon realize they're mistaken. They're looking for the millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston) whose young wife Bunny ran up a debt. The Dude's unstable friend Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) convinces him to go see the rich Lebowski for compensation for the rug. Later Bunny is kidnapped for a $1M ransom. Rich Lebowski asks the Dude to do the ransom hand off. Walter tries to double cross the kidnappers but the drop off goes terribly wrong. The money is stolen. All the while, the Dude and Walter is in a bowling tournament with Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi). Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore) is Lebowski's daughter who wants the Dude to recover the money from the kidnappers.",0
13,25 September 1998,CuriosityKilledShawn,6," You see what happens, Larry?",It's hard to pick out one line of dialogue in particular for two reasons. One-almost everything said in this film is downright hilarious. And Two-the F word is spoken 281 times so there's not many sentences that don't contain it. 144 sentences also end in 'man'.,6
14,21 April 2015,davispittman,2, I don't understand why this is loved by so many!,"This movie is truly awful! It's supposed to be some legendary comedy, but it IS NOT funny! This movie is just really weird and stupid. Literally nothing makes sense in it, i hate every character except Julianne Moore's. The dude is so stupid and annoying, and so is John Goodman! I was struggling to understand what in the world the plot was about, and i never laughed, not once! This movie's ONLY saving grace was Julianne Moore, she actually did a good job, and i liked her character, but everything else....nope! 2/10. Save your time for a much better comedy, and just movie in general, such as Plains trains and automobiles, or a million other better ones!",9
15,9 September 2004,Quinoa1984,10," Arguably the Coen Brother's funniest work, with a superb lead in Bridges","The Big Lebowski, whether you laugh during the film or not, is assuredly one of the most laid-back of the nineties. I don't mean that by saying that its main fan-base are slackers or hippies or other, but that the whole tone of the film has that air to it. The plot the Coens construct, which is as wonderfully convoluted as a 40's mystery tale (the kinds of stories they get inspired by- The Big Sleep was most likely their title goof), almost gets in the way of the main character and his friends' lives. ""The Dude"" Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) has a good, if devoid of ""meaning"", life- he bowls constantly with his crazed, Vietnam-vet friend Walter (John Goodman, also very note-worthy) and quiet friend Donny (Steve Buscemi, a fine performance based mostly on reactions), with the occasional setback or weirdo to confront him (i.e. John Turturro's Jesus, a highlight in the film's most absurd moments). Enter in a group of deranged ex-musicians turned nihilists (which include the likes of Peter Stormare and Flea), a pornographer, and a rich man with the same name as Lebowski and his family, and the Dude's cycle is turned upside down, though not knocking into his chemical intake.",1
16,1 January 2020,RodrigAndrisan,2, Greatest film ever? Really?,"Everybody exaggerates by lifting this film in glory, considering it a super masterpiece. I don't. It's just another ordinary American movie, it didn't even make me laugh, although it's kind of like Comedy. Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are the same as in all their other films and the script is as trivial and already known from many other films, nothing original, mistaken identity.
Steve Buscemi is the same too, having an almost silent role here. The only more special ones are Julianne Moore and John Turturro. With their performances they don't save the film being just an average mediocre production made in the movie making factory on the treadmill also called Hollywood.",3
17,9 March 2012,TheUnknown837-1,5, Obnoxious characters swamped in a story that is much too pretentious and complicated for its own good,"Here are the highlights of ""The Big Lebowski."" The opening scene with Jeff Bridges, as a never-do-well being comically ambushed by two men in his home, one of whom urinates on his living room rug. Mr. Bridges again, dropping a joint on his crotch while he's driving and careening into a trash can. Mr. Bridges yet again babbling absolute nonsense, trying to fake his way out of a jam. Mr. Bridges, yes he, being bonked in the head with a ceramic mug.",/
18,17 December 2020,auuwws,9, The Big Lebowski,"A very interesting movie that I really enjoyed watching. The characters were funny, especially Walter and The Dude, the story of the film was average, but it was a good engine for the events of the film. The end of the film was not good.",?
19,1 September 2010,Hitchcoc,9," Goodman and Bridges, Oh My!","This is one of those movies I never got around to seeing. It is one of the most delightful black comedies of all time. Watching the byplay between the frenetic John Goodman and Jeff Bridges is priceless. The plot is all over the place and we are played once in a while, but the excitement is in the journey, not the end. Bridges' character is the laid back, sixties protest type who is accosted one day (a case of mistaken identity) as a couple of thugs beat him and one pees on his rug. This sets in motion and effort to find the man who shares his name and get his rug replaced (he ultimately steals one of the man's rugs). This sets off John Goodman (a poster child for anger management). They become involved in a kidnapping drop and I can't begin to explain the rest. Suffice it to say, these guys have a great chemistry and all Bridges can do is watch the dominoes fall. Goodman has made a career of playing lovable psychos for the Coen Brothers. This may be his masterpiece.",r
20,5 September 2017,Horst_In_Translation,8," Pederasts, nihilists and rugs","Sounds like a Three Stooges short no? But wait and see: ""The Big Lebowski"" is an American 2-hour film from 1998, so this one will have its 20th anniversary next year. It is of course by the Oscar-winning Coen Brothers and even without gigantic awards attention, this is definitely a contender for their most known as it has turned into a real cult classic over the years. This is also thanks to the cast, not just to the script. There are three performers in here who won acting Oscars later in their careers, namely the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore and of course Jeff Bridges who plays the central character in here and who is really good at it, even if I might give the edge to John Goodman (Argo, Roseanne) here in terms of who I'd pick as the film's MVP. But there's also people in here that you would not necessarily expect like Tara Reid or RHCP's Flea. And then there's Coen regulars like Stormare, Buscemi (both Fargo) and Turturro (Barton Fink). A lot of fun for sure. The Coens once again succeed in writing even the minor characters in a way where they stay in mind thanks to their mannerisms and behavioral patterns. Very well done and this tendency has elevated many Coen films. And as absurd as these characters may occasionally seem, there is still something authentic to them. You never get the impression that you are actually watching actors in roles here, but they feel like actual people. Of course, on the other hand, not everything is perfect with this movie. The scenes with Julianne Moore didn't do too much for me, especially her early scenes. Sam Elliott I also could have done without. I like his narration voice, that would have been enough although his conversation with Bridges' character was also fine in the middle of the film and how they talk about cowboy looks, profanity etc. But with him saying the final words, the film did not exactly close at its best I suppose. Also kinda feel he has a tendency to always play the same character and it seems that back then he looked exactly the way he looks today. But for every negative criticism I have, there are at least five positive things for me to say about this film. The best example is really everything involving John Goodman. His scene with the gun was a riot, only the Coens can depict an actually dangerous situation in a manner as hilarious and entertaining as they did here. His scene in the car when they are about to give the money to the abductors is even better and how he keeps talking about beating the crap out of them. And it's no empty words either as we find out eventually when he runs indeed into the three German nihilists. Poor Buscemi's character. Or, again about Goodman, his recurring words directed at Buscemi's character. Or how he keeps mentioning Vietnam to show how tough he is. And if we are talking about recurring references already, Bridges' character has his own too of course, such as how he keeps ordering the same drink, even if they may not be as good as Goodman's. The dialogue writing is top-notch here for sure and even if this is always the case with the Coens and their films, we should not take it for granted. Too many examples. One that stayed in the mind for me is the ""let me take another look"" (or something like that) when the bad guys keep pushing his head inside the toilet early on. What a cool dude. No pun intended.",e
21,17 August 1998,Ash-37,8, Coen brothers unabashedly out of control! A plethora of fun!,"The Coen brothers are up there with my very favorite filmmakers (Scorsese, Kubrick, Carpenter).  I am very fond of their work.  Throughout their irreverent career, they have explored different subjects and themes.  Their best stories evolve from  kidnapping schemes in films like ""Raising Arizona "" and ""Fargo"", one of my very favorites.  I thought that film was fervently free.  I was so ever wrong. It's as if the Coen Brothers have celebrated their complete breakthrough success (Academy Award winners), and now are willing to do whatever they please.  ""The Big Lebowski"" is a film so meandering, so wonderfully novel, that I found myself missing the many other sporadic jokes as I was heaving from laughter.  The film is basically about mistaken identity, eccentric characters, and a soiled rug.  This film extols the bowler, the allies, even the pins.  We experience an actual bowling ball POV, as the Dude (Jeff Bridges) hallucinates.  This film has nihilists, feminists, millionares, paedophiles, drugged out hippies, underachieving students, incompetent criminals, pornographers and 'Nam veterans.  This movie is open to anything , anything... Some people are turned off by absurd looniness, because it's so grandiosely different.  Yet who couldn't chuckle, if not explode, when a bowler dressed in a tight purple suit licks a bowling ball's finger hole, and the camera pans down to reveal his name as Jesus! I will disclose no more, but urgently recommend you to traverse to your nearest video abode and rent this true escapists' feature. Abandon all solemn inhibitons, though!  One can not keep a straight face whilst watching.",f

Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, Peter Stormare and John Turturro all in one place are reason enough to recommend this movie, but don't expect too much. Reputation far surpasses it.",=
24,5 April 2012,billcr12,1, Major disappointment,"I am in shock that the Coen brothers, who are responsible for Fargo, one of my ten best, could have written such a sophomoric waste of talent, most especially Jeff Bridges who is given the wonderful words, hey man and hey dude, over and over.

25,27 January 2017,mnpollio,1, Indefensible garbage,"I have been a fan of a number of efforts from the Coen Brothers. Truthfully, even when they miss the mark, I am still able to find something worthwhile in the effort. The Big Lebowski is the exception to that rule. I originally saw it in theaters, where it played for an eyeblink and received mixed reviews. It was one of the few films my family has ever walked out on. I caught it later on cable and watched it to the end to see if I missed anything worthwhile, since it had inexplicably developed a cult following. The answer was a resounding no.",t

27,5 November 1998,Oliver1984,10, A Great film,"The Coen Brothers did it again! Just when I had lost my hope of seeing a new, GOOD, American movie, I went to see this. It absolutely blew my mind! Now I've seen all the Coen-films, and I'd have to say that this is one of the very best. It's about this guy, ""The Dude"", excellently played by Jeff Bridges, who gets an unexpected visit from two thugs who soil his carpet. This event triggers a kidnapping-drama, filled with black humor and crazy characters. I'd recommend this film to everyone with an open mind and a twisted sense of humor. Perhaps thats why I liked it so much.",u

The tremendous dependence on a single expletive and its many forms became dull and boring after the first five minutes during which it was used about 100 times. The two scenes in which a topless woman appeared were obviously inserted just so she could be shown, but there was no point other than that one. The scene in which a Corvette was destroyed was completely predictable, and it unfolded in a strange way, and then faded away.",v

It's quirky and weird and that kind of movie has its place. Why there is such a cult following for this one I will never understand. Maybe it was hyped up too much for me from the beginning...,

The Coen brothers are two of the best
filmmakers of the decade and one of their most popular movie is The Big Lebowski, and it's easy to see why, the film is absolutely hilarious I especially love the constant beatings that the Dude's car takes, the acting is on point with Jeff Bridges and John Goodman obviously standing out and the mistery and thriller part of the movie is actually pretty interesting too in my opinion. However I don't think the movie is perfect, I don't really get or find funny the dream sequences and overall I don't feel the movie is very memourable and doesn't stand out much for me.

Last night I saw it on purpose with a couple of friends and I think I'm stating to realize what is it - A unique combination of talents all looking in the same direction --- The Coen Brothers are, probably, the only ones who know what they are seeing and the rest just trust their vision. Totally. Jeff Bridges is miraculous. His character is unique, never seen and at the same times is all of Bridges characters put together. I love him in this part and I love the Coen brothers for writing it knowing, I'm sure, that Bridges was going to give it that real, totally real surreal kind of life. Philip Seymour Hoffman, comes in to do what he does best, being memorable and then, of course, John Tarturro, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, delicious, each one of them - I'm pretty sure The Big Lebowski will be around for centuries and it will always have something to say even if we don't know exactly what.",

Along with Jeff, there's his slacker friends: the motormouth Walter (John Goodman) and the loopy Donny (Steve Buscemi). As for the side characters, I liked Maude's (Julianne Moore) remark about conception, and the narrator's (Sam Elliott) note about Saddam Hussein. It's just a great, hilarious, even humanizing movie. Also starring are John Turturro as a sex offender, and Philip Seymour Hoffman as a servant.

The Coen brothers consistently impress me with their ability to write an interesting story with fascinating yet quirky characters. Without resorting to gratuitous sexual scenes like many other writer/directors of R rated films the Coen brothers manage to add the right amount of language and violence that is necessary to the story without it becoming the only reason for watching. 'The Big Lebowski' has so many clever and hilarious lines that you have to watch it over and over again. ",

Actors and actresses in supporting roles are outstanding too. Thirdly, the soundtrack is very suitable to what happens on the screen.
So, it's one of the best comedy ever",
53,15 July 2008,HelloTexas11,6, enjoyable stoner comedy,"'The Big Lebowski' was supposedly inspired by the old Humphrey Bogart classic, 'The Big Sleep,' but I don't see it, unless every movie ever made with a convoluted plot is to be considered a descendant of it. What it reminds me of is Martin Scorsese's 'After Hours,' with which it has much more in common. Specifically, the story of an inconsequential character who gets caught up in a byzantine series of situations; the other main feature of such a story is that seemingly anything bad that can happen to the character, does. 'After Hours' though was better, and funnier. I think what 'The Big Lebowski' lacks is the frenetic pace of 'After Hours.' This film just sort of ambles along, amiable and occasionally very funny. Like most Coen Brothers' movies, it is determinedly odd in a lot of ways, but so many films these days are, that quality doesn't come across as terribly unique, or even original. Jeff Bridges is the perfect choice to play Jeff Lebowski, aka 'Dude.' The very definition of the term 'slacker,' Dude doesn't have much of a life beyond bowling, smoking pot, and drinking White Russians. He has two close friends, Walter (John Goodman) and Donny (Steve Buscemi), and their socializing appears limited to bowling tournaments. But Bridges invests Dude with a sly kind of laidback style; he comes across as a very likable ne'er-do-well, somebody you wouldn't mind spending a few hours with at the corner bar (or bowling alley). Goodman's Walter is a hyper Vietnam Vet who lacks common sense to an astonishing degree and is completely oblivious to that fact; Buscemi's character Donny seems to exist for the sole purpose of being told to shut up, usually by Walter. The film enjoys being weird and bucking convention here and there. A sort of running gag is that whenever Dude is knocked unconscious (and yes, it happens more than once), we enter a dream sequence. The best one is an elaborately staged dance number set to the '60s hit, ""I Just Dropped In To See What Condition My Condition Was In."" Julianne Moore plays an avant-garde artist with a (surprise) strange outlook on art, sex, and life in general. She's pretty good too. But some of the other oddball supporting characters, like the three Nihilists, are more like something you'd see in a VERY average 'Saturday Night Live' sketch. 'The Big Lebowski' has its own semi-quirky, meandering kind of charm and Coen aficionados will probably enjoy it more than the average moviegoer. Its main appeal, to me anyway, is Bridges' performance. He really inhabits the character of Dude and it's a lot of fun listening to him deliver the droll stoner dialogue throughout. That alone makes the film worth checking out.",
54,15 June 2013,ironhorse_iv,9, A dude's dude movie. Nearly a perfect comedy. The Dude abides,"I love this movie so much. Anybody who doesn't like it, must be name Donny. Why? Because he must be out of his element. So shut up, Donny. It felt like a live, free-flowing work of comedy, action, and mystery. The Big Lebowski is an American classic that defied initial critical and box office failure to become a treasure of a film. This is one of the Coen's brothers most cleverly devised and executed stories. The plot surrounds the story about 'the laziest man in Los Angeles County' unemployed loser Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) who get mistaken for philanthropic millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston) by henchman hired by pornographer gangster Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara). The Dude is a fairly good character, with White Russia in hand every time. You will hear that name a lot, about 161 times in the movie. They rough him up, and urine on his rug before last threaten to kill the millionaire's sexy young wife Bunny (Tara Reid) who the Dude has no clue of. With his bowling buddies, security-store owner and suppose Vietnam Vet Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and mild-mannered ex-surfer Donny (Steve Buscemi) take a Raymond Chandler like journey into the world of crime, violence, sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll to find another rug. This movie has a world of its own, there is nothing I can think of comparing it to and it was a great experience and I still enjoy watching it. Donnie, Walter and The Dude were made for Buscemi, Goodman and Bridges. The supporting cast is great as well. I like Julianne Moore as Maude Lebowski, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Brandt, Peter Stormare as Karl Hungus and last John Turturro as Jesus. They all had memorable scenes and many unforgettable quotes. The character Jesus' potential was totally wasted in my opinion as he didn't serve anything to the plot. Lots of profanity-laced, repetitive tirades masquerading as hilarious dialogue that was a hit or a miss for some viewers. I got the humor, but for some people, they might see this as dumb. The editing needs some work as there is a lot of continuity problems, some crew visible, and a few audio/visual unsynchronized. Talking about audio. There's a soundtrack worth checking out. I love the Spanish flamenco version of The Eagles's Hotel California. It was awesome. Another song worth checking is Just Dropped In by Kenny Rodgers drifts through an elaborate bowling fantasy sequence titled Gutterballs. Nearly all of the visible symbols in The Dude's second dream sequence are taken from earlier scenes. While it's pretty good scene, it was kinda out of place. It was pretty pointless. Was I the only one totally lost when this scene played the first time watching it? There's something incredibly philosophical about the appearances of Saddam Hussein and the Gulf War in this movie. They're like an antithesis to the Dude. While the dude signifies the spirit of peace and and calm in the movie, Saddam symbolizes violence and war by being one of the greatest villains of the second half of the 20th century. The movie is often use for use as social and political analysis of many topics such as carnivalesque of modern society, commodity fetishism, neoconservatism etc. etc. In my opinion, while it does talk about major topic, it never does finish or make sense in the end of the film. There isn't a complex climax to the film. Sam Elliot appears at the conclusion to spout some bewildering nonsense that's meant to tack an explanation onto the end. Deep, I guess. So that might disappoint some people. What is it all really about? Who knows, let's just go bowling. Time heals all critical misconceptions, I guess as the movie fail when it came out, but grew into a cult following. This movie is like a good rug. Really tied the room together when looking at it.",

I have fought this for quite some time, but must now give it up for the greatness that is ... the Coen Brothers. Bad pub made me stay away from Lebowski on its theatrical release, and am just now getting around to it.  What a gem! Truly brilliant casting and the Coen's now customary bizarre dialog make this one something special.  Who, but the Coens, would cast Steve Buscemi as a former surfer or Flea (Red Hot Chili Peppers) as a nihilist?  Yes, we expect perfection from Jeff Bridges every time - here he delivers.  Is he a slacker or just a decent guy who doesn't wish his rug soiled?  Bridges perfectly captures the spirit of the dude.  Goodman is his usual over-the-top self, only moreso.  His dialog seems at time pulled straight from ""Casino"", if you f** know what I f** mean.  The beautiful Julianne Moore seems a bit disinterested in her role until her wonderful scene for improving conception.  Philip Seymour Hoffman again shows why he is absolutely the best young character actor working today.  Tara Reid (""Cruel Intentions"" and ""American Pie"") has a brief yet effective role as teh trophy wife with confusing intentions.  David Huddleston steals his scenes for the first time since ""Blazing Saddles"" and Coen regular, John Turturro is terrifically offbeat as Jesus the wonder bowler.  Sam Elliot lends a touch of class as the stranger, and don't miss Aimee Mann ('til Tuesday) and Ben Gazarra.  Another aspect that we have come to expect in Coen movies is a wonderful soundtrack.  Lebowski provides us with Dylan and Costello along with the wonderful work of Carter Burwell. This movie begs for repeat viewings, but do brace yourself for the boundary pushing.",

Every scene he is in is practically carried by him (Pulling a gun on Smokey, the money drop at the bridge, fighting the nihilists). His constant unrelated reminders that he saw his buddies die face down in the mud in Vietnam are also very funny. The supporting cast does good too (Buschemi, Seymour-Hoffman, Moore).

Almost two years ago, I have already explored the films of the iconic Coen brothers, and since it was during one of the troubled periods of my life, I ended up disliking them for some reason. ""Fargo"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" were the two main casualties of this depressed time where not even my favourite films were able to cheer me up, and I knew that something was wrong. Fortunately, now that a lot of time has passed and I am glad to say that I am doing fine again, I have had the feeling that I needed to rectify this matter, and after having watched (and loved) the Frances McDormand lead snow thriller in February, I decided it was time to give The Dude another chance. As expected, I was able to appreciate it this time around, and honestly, this film is probably one of the best most genuinely hilarious comedies I have ever seen. Seriously, there is literally nothing wrong with it, and the story is masterclass writing as well. The Dude (or El Duderino, if you are not into the whole brevity thing), a layabout and White Russian aficionado, whose real name is Jeff Lebowski, is mistaken for a millionaire who is called the same, and before he could turn round, he is unwittingly entangled in a weird web of kidnapping, rug thievery and bowling tournaments. Even if it sounds like probably the worst things to combine in a film, the Coen brothers know to control the apparent nonsense and turn it into a sophisticated game. It is one of those rare case where the film is defined and made perfect by its screenplay. With meticulous precision, the writer-directors composed a comical crime thriller where not a single line of dialogue, not a single moment and not even a single second of footage feels out of place or unnecessary. The dialogues are pure wit, full of situational and running gags, as well as quotable lines. Seriously, the film makes you laugh for its sheer intelligence and not for infantile actions or lavatorial jokes. Of course, cuss words a crucial factor for why it works out, but they are never used mindlessly and only give the quirky characters a lot of realism. Oh, yes, the characters are another key element of why this film is so iconic. Next to the gown wearing, bowling enthusiastic bum The Dude (one of Jeff Bridges' finest performances), you have his best friend, the choleric Vietnam war veteran and (probably) Jewish hothead Walter (John Goodman is on fire here), a perverse Mexican bowling star called Jesus, a millionaire and his way too young wife, as well as an artistical and sexually open heiress and, hold your hat, a group of German Nazi Nihilist that were formerly porn movie actors and a famous synthpop group (whoa). Savour this slowly! It is downright ludicrous yet brilliant, as the whole story makes it even better. What started out as a pacifistic dude's request to get a replacement for his beloved rug an Asian-American has urinated on, ends up as a twisted and eclectic crime spectacle that is as complicated and confused as its overwhelmed protagonist. First, there was an abduction, than there was not, money was traded and not, The Dude gets punched in the face multiple times for no specific reason, games of bowling are casually played, politics are discussed, dance sequences and dreams are pivotal as well, and in the end, a group of German Nihilists get beaten up in the parking lot. What? Yes, all of this, and even more, but you cannot name it all without giving it all away, because as absurd as it might sound, it is all coherent and intelligently connected. In the end, it is one of those films you need to see to fully comprehend, and there is not a single second when this film isn't pure comedy gold. It now makes me realize how tremendously depressed I must have been back in the day to be unable to love this absolute masterpiece, and I am so glad that I gave it another chance. Most protagonist of comedies you will forget after a time, but man, The Dude abides.",
99,26 December 2009,bobsgrock,9, Completely original and unforgettable.,There never was before and there probably never will be a film quite like The Big Lebowski. It has a typical film noir story arc mixed with a couple of stoner characters and a hip setting in the early 1990s Los Angeles that creates a great atmosphere to watch the action unfold. This is Raymond Chandler on vacation; relaxed and willing to stretch out and let loose.,

109,16 August 2020,saadanathan,9, One of the greatest ever and the dude abides 9/10,"""The Big Lebowski"" is considered to be among the best movies ever made. The Coen brothers have wrote and directed a wonderful epic movie that has a huge fan base till this day. Centered around a figure called ""the dude"" who finds himself in an unlikely weird adventure consisting of neo nazis, thugs, a big scam, dirty undies and bowling. Jeffrey Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is the dude and the perfect example of an unemployed bachelor middle aged guy who's life style is mostly cannabis and bowling. Jeff Bridges gives what is probably his best performance in a movie ever, and it is known for being his most iconic role ever. John Goodman also gives a wonderful and amazing performance as Walter Sobchak and is mostly hilarious in the film. Gets all the good lines. The film stars other great and well actors: Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore, John Turturro, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Sam Elliott. What I love mostly about the film is it's empty plot. Of course there is a lot going on but there are so many bizarre things happening that it doesn't matter anymore what the film's about, nor what are the films motives. In one opening scene you get an introduction to the character and how two thugs ruin his rug. In another scene the dude's car is stolen. Afterwards the characters go investigate a teenager and end up ruining somebody else's car. The point is that the plot is not important, the movie draws most of its magic from the characters and their interactions. Which to me is an important key role in movies to have characters who are fun and have many things happening to them. At the end of the day this is probably one of the best movies ever made and the dude abides on that. Now let's go bowling.",

The character building is also very strong. The Dude, Walter and Donny are nicely three sides of a coin, the lazy no good bum, the overly strict and cranky hot-head, and the cowering coward ready to run from anything that shows the slightest sign of danger. The acting overall is quite nice. Jeff Bridges proves his acting prowess in role here as the lazy bum. John Goodman really inserts the crazy comedies from his lines and character role.

117,17 October 2002,jmiertschin,9, Is Maude based on Hepburn fron Suddenly Last Summer?,"I just saw the Tennesse William's film Suddenly Last Summer the other night and I found there to be a distinct similarity between Katherine Hepburn's character Violet and Julianna Moore's Maude from The Big Lebowski.  Now I don't think that Maude is a copy of Violet but if you listen to the way she talks and the way she leads a conversation you can hear a distinct similarity between them.  The best part of the movie to make this comparison is when Hepburn is showing Montgomery Clift around her son's garden and the way she talks about flowers and her niece Catherine (Elizabeth Taylor) and then compare that to when Maude first meets The Dude and she is talking about art, the female form, sex, and her step mother Bunny.  I don't know, maybe it's just me.  For other Cohen Brother inspiration check out The Alan Ladd/Veronica Lake film ""The Glass Key,"" as inspiration for ""Miller's Crossing,"" and check out Akim Tamiroff as Uncle Joe Grande in ""Touch of Evil"" as a model for several characters that Jon Polito plays in a bunch of Cohen Brother's movies.",

Jeff Lebowski(Jeff Bridges)is a pot bellied, pot-smoking laid back slacker that insists on being called ""The Dude"". His two best friends are Walter(John Goodman), who sees the world against him for surviving the Viet Nam War; and Donny(Steve Buscemi), who manages to butt-in on conversations only to be ignored. Dude's world consists of bowling and getting stoned. Somehow Dude is mistaken for a wheel-chaired millionaire (David Huddleston)and is caught up in a kidnapping scam for the ransom. Dude seems more upset with getting restitution for his urine ruined rug. Dude of course needs the aid of his two foul-mouthed bowling friends. Also fitting into this amusing plot are: Julianne Moore as Maude the erotic artist; John Turturro as a hair-netted Latino bowler named Jesus and Tara Reid as sexpot Bunny Lebowski. Rounding out this diverse cast of characters are Philip Seymour Huffman, Ben Gazzara, Flea and Sam Elliott, who also narrates.

John Goodman is great as his psycho Vietnam freak pal although Coen favourites Steve Buscemi and John Turturro seem wasted in do-little supporting roles. Anyway the story unravels well until all of a sudden the razor sharp humour is replaced by the constant blurting out of four letter words, while the storyline just seems to shoot itself in the foot and the whole film becomes one big muddle, and at nearly 2 hours it seems to go on for far too long.

I chose this one since I have seen it most recently and it is a pretty simple film with a seemingly complex plot. This is one of the Coen Brothers' best films - not necessarily in the sense of great cinema, but rather in relation to the factor of entertaining the audience. I showed this film to my good friend Spencer just a few months ago and he wanted to watch it again tonight. It is easy to see why since I was quoting/enjoying a lot of the film for its great comedy, such as the many times Walter says ""shut the f--- up, Donnie,"" how the Dude repeats things he hears from other people in order to get his point across, or how ridiculous the narrator's moustache is. I remember that on first viewing I did not appreciate this film since it is revealed by the Dude towards the conclusion that the MacGuffin of the film - the briefcase filled with a million dollars - was never really filled in the first place. Like Fargo, The Big Lebowski deals with the idea that most will go out of their habits or comfort zone in order to obtain an amount of money - however, it does so in a more ridiculous manner than Fargo. After a few re-watches I have found it important to appreciate this film's comedy rather than make sense of the almost non-existent plot in order to enjoy it. Does it matter that The Dude's journey turns into a dead end? No; his journey is still progressive as he goes from not giving a damn about anything to confronting people of the seemingly upper class about using him, and the journey has a great deal of laughs making this a great cinematic experience to enjoy and reflect on the importance of taking things easy in everyday life. 3.5/4.0",

The Coen Brothers get rid of the shuffling time line and have episodes and chapters in order, but it is just as intricate as the other, except that it is harmless, more or less, and funny in the punk beatnik post 1968 style if you like that and the unemployed who play the Greek philosophers.. It means that the mistake in ""Pulp Fiction"" becomes the rule here and everything is over-reacting and mis-targeting the true victim of the explosion, of temper of course, never of any fire-arms, though quite a few are moving and travelling around, just like bowling pins and bowling balls. That's a way of looking at suburban social sprawl that deserves some attention and time. The best debunking of pulp fiction is in the bar-diner scene. A lot of noise and ruckus for very little. I like the breaking in, out and through of all sorts of cars.

I'm not much of a fan of anyone named Bridges (except for Nash) so that didn't help. Anything they're in is usually abysmal. I really can't imagine why this is regarded as a classic cult comedy, or maybe it isn't and I just thought it was.

But this film is not as great a film as it is rated as it lacks truly redemptive qualities of reconciliation, or say, tying together a greater purpose behind it, let alone a great plot like say its parallels with Raymond Chandler's 1939 novel, The Big Sleep, of which it does no justice to in being loosely related. However, in another sense, it's greater purpose can be looked at differently: that since its the ultimate slacker film, it has no need for a greater purpose in the first place. But, that's just like, my opinion, man. Let's say, just like the rug that 'held the room together', Bridges, the Dude, in an oddly engaging way, was the only thing that held the film together for me. And save also for an unbelievably spaced out and unconventionally witty and nihilistic (which is ironic considering the brilliant Coen brothers seemed to be mocking nihilists) script, not the plot, the film is one of the most anti-establishment in terms of relativism.",

189,9 October 2015,serafinogm,7, Enjoyed most of the movie but did not appreciate the neocon propaganda peppered throughout!,"Think what you want of Saddam (I think of him as a traitor to his people) but the fact is he was a paid CIA employee dating back to 1959 (probably earlier), when he was part of a CIA-authorized six-man squad tasked with assassinating then Iraqi Prime Minister Gen Abd al-Karim Qasim (who was an asshole as well but he was our asshole until he made a fatal mistake and he in CIA terms had to go). The first attempt failed but eventually in February 1963 Qasim was killed in a Baath Party coup which was followed by an orgy of bloodshed. The leftists were all murdered and the lists of those to be killed were supplied by the CIA! Saddam eventually became dictator of Iraq and we played him like an instrument. George Bush Sr. needed to look strong so April Glaspie, (our Ambassador to Iraq) when approached by Saddam regarding Kuwait invited him to invade Kuwait by stating the following: ""We have no opinion on your Arab-Arab conflicts, such as your dispute with Kuwait. Secretary Baker has directed me to emphasize the instruction, first given to Iraq in the 1960s, that the Kuwait issue is not associated with America."" We were setting him up to make Bush Sr. look like a strong leader. Anyone who spent the least amount of time reading between the lines knew this at the time, yet a horrible slaughter ensued that was so freaking unnecessary, but hey ""money trumps peace"" (quote from George Bush Jr.), in reality actually it's really more than just money! Okay enough of my rant to sum it up I loved the movie but cringed at the unnecessary propaganda that conveniently predated the release of the PNAC position paper! The performances were magnificent especially Jeff and John. I encourage everyone to watch it but be aware it's really a propaganda piece designed to get you ready for the next Iraq war!

The dude is such a shameless person, that his story and style can remind me of people's stereotyped, dull and ignorant behaviors. If you identify with the dude's personality, this movie will make you think about whether you're reacting too aggressively and emotionally at times, that at the most of these times, you don't have to give a dam about things.

The film is ridiculously enjoyable, with great performances all around, especially from Jeff Bridges as 'The Dude' and John Goodman as Walter. The plot is messy, but adequate, and provides a very interesting line to follow- even if it isn't perfect. The direction is masterful, the Coen brothers do a fantastic job as always, and the cinematography is terrific as well. Very few films use its soundtrack as usefully as this one does, and I was very glad to hear such a great sound and thus resulting from it- a great atmosphere- from the film and was pleasantly surprised of its inclusion in the film.

He seeks retribution after his rug is urinated upon but instead is given a proposition and instructed to drop off a brief case full of cash. Plot turns follow with stolen cars, severed toes, and a ferret used for interrogation. Wayward behaviour filmed stylistically by Ethan and Joel Coen who can add this to a long list of stylistic achievements such as Blood Simple and Fargo. Jeff Bridges plays Jeff Lebowski, known as ""The Dude,""a lazy bowling slob whose life was simple until mistaken identity complicated his seemingly innocent existence. John Goodman plays the Vietnam crazed Walter who bowls and unintentionally foils the Dude's brief case drop off. Julianne Moore plays Maude Lebowski with a proposition of her own. She is the rich Lebowski's daughter who suspends herself via straps and paints in the nude. Steve Buscemi plays Donnie, a belittled bowling pal who cannot get a word out.

The plot centres around the theft of 'the Dude's' rug (Jeff Bridges), and his subsequent quest for its return, which takes in nihilists, modern, improv. dance and, of course, bowling. Steve Buscemi plays a timid 'Donnie', constantly under the thumb of the domineering, Vietnam obsessed 'Walter' (Goodman). Whilst it is hard to pick an outstanding performance...John Goodman is stellar, consistently funny...but watch out for Jesus. Also, Flea has a brief cameo. All in all, a fantastic film, one of my all time top ten...I guess that sometimes there's a film which, well, it's the film for it's time and place.",

The cast is pure perfection. Some of regular Coen movies actors are on board as always. Plus of course the mighty Jeff Bridges, with the great portrait of DUDISM he offers us, and his phenomenal supporting actor, John Goodman, who doesn't wait for his time to shine to pull out the big guns.
Speaking of plot, it might not be a kind of conventional comedy as we already know, and the beyond belief executions that it offers us through the movie will persuade you about my opinion.

217,12 April 2015,lesleyharris30,8," Strange, Funny and Stronge Performances,","The Big Lebowski is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. With it's very goofy set up and even its characters, you wouldn't expect very big performances from the cast, but they all deliver superb acting, they were all taking a huge risk with this very unusual film, and they ended up making a good choice. My favourite scenes are definitely any one between Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, the chemistry between the two of them is terrific, they both play very unique characters, nothing like any of their previous roles. It's definitely longer than it needs to be, it's nearly too hours long, and with the story being as ridiculous as it is, this can get a little bit tiring after a while, but it is mostly entertaining and hilarious throughout. Very different and packs in plenty of laughs, I would recommend the Big Lebowski to anyone looking for a good comedy. ",

It's hard to comprehend people actually like this overrated dud and claim it's funny and entertaining. As if the muddled and overloaded script and plot weren't enough, the characters aren't the least bit interesting to watch. Jeff Bridges' character is an unemployed loser, and for that reason alone, we're suppose to think he's ""really cool"". I bet slacker misfits must be the only ones who could identify with such character. Moreover, John Goodman's character is downright obnoxious. Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, and John Turturro are wasted in nonsensical roles. Plus, the laughs are few and far between. The cliff scene when John Goodman scatters Steve Buscemi's ashes but the wind blows them on to Jeff Bridges' face, is probably the funniest bit in the whole movie. Everything else seems forced. The music is forgettable and if you want a better display of Roger Deakins' cinematography, I suggest you see a better Coen brothers' film - O Brother, Where Art Thou?

It actually is a movie about.. nothing! there are some characters thrown in for good measure that really do not serve any purpose (for eg Julianne Moore's character). It was boring and at no moment in the movie did I feel like laughing hard. Jeff Bridges is good in his role. If this movie can get an average rating of 8.2 then by that logic 'The Pineapple express' too should be up here within the confines of the IMDb top 250. The fact that it isn't and this movie is means that there is something horribly wrong with people's perceptions.

235,29 December 2021,tennisboyn,6, The best of its kind,"Being a staunch opponent of drug use, this brand of humor doesn't usually suit my bill, but it is still one of the funniest movies I have seen recently. The camaraderie between Bridges, Goodman, and (kind of) Buscemi is excellent, although Buscemi's portrayal of the idiotic, unaware friend got old very quickly. Perhaps the funniest scene in the whole movie is Moore's character flying overhead to squirt paint on her abstract art... after reading that her character was influenced by Yoko Ono, it couldn't be more hilarious and true. I did love the cinematography and lighting, as well as the frequent dives into psychedelic episodes. The transitions into those scenes were especially well executed. All in all, the characters were casted near perfectly, and the constant juxtaposition of a stoner and Hollywood drama sequences was hilarious... that's what works with this movie. The bare concept is so hilarious that the entire movie is just soaking it all in, and even then it isn't overdone. The biggest surprise of this movie is that some of the humor is quite sophisticated, although there are plenty of the hackneyed stoner jokes as well.

Then go figure what it is to watch it for a full length movie. The worst thing is, the fact this movie was done by the Coen bros. and has a well known cast gives it an aura of respectability it does not deserve.

It's understandable though why so many people enjoy this picture. There are quite a few chuckle worthy moments and the characters are quite funny in how quirky they are.The actors are rather charming and the Coen brothers are good directors. However, that doesn't make up for the fact that this movie adds up to nothing. Random events happen for no good reason, many of the characters are completely pointless and even the story is unnecessary as well. It starts off with this unique crime plot about ""The Dude""-a lazy bum-who gets mistaken for a millionaire with the same name as him. The Dude then gets caught up in this convulted scheme by German nihilists to blackmail the millionaire by holding his trophy wife hostage. But by the end of the flick I realized that absolutely nothing was at stake. I don't want to spoil it so I will just leave it at that. I don't mind if a story just wants to meander around aimlessly. Alice in Wonderland does that but at least there's a reason for it, they are in a dream like world that makes no sense. Here, they set up this world like its flesh and blood reality where things are run by rules and regulations but then some things will happen out of nowhere and lead to nothing-like the plot. You can't have a world run by both chaos and order. It just doesn't make any sense. That's The Big Lebowski. It feels like the whole movie is a big joke the Coen brothers are pulling on the audience. You are given a tour of strange characters that are tied together by a overly complicated plot that meant nothing in the end. I wouldn't recommend this unless watching a bunch of walking character quirks stumble around for an hour and a half sounds like fun to you. And if you do, don't worry you aren't alone.",

I made it through the whole thing, but there were parts that dragged and it's also borderline depressing at times, but has enough humor sprinkled in to get me through. it IS quirky, and I can see how the 'cult classic' gets attached due to the repetition of certain comedic themes throughout.

It's not a detective/comedy and it sure as hell isn't a bowling comedy; it's a lifestyle movie with wonderfully written characters.  Jesus is a perfect example of comedic genius with a flat character.  He's a pedophile bowler that has the ability to intimidate guys like the Dude, who probably doesn't really even care enough to be intimidated. But that's the type of conflict that this movie deals with.  The Dude and Walter never really learn any lesson or go through any major character changes.  You must keep in mind that this movie is just a crazy story whose main purpose is to express the comedic traits within the characters.  Fans of character conflict should love this aspect.  Those looking for a buildup and climax may not appreciate the story so much.  The whole detective story is given to the audience blatantly.  But, like the Dude, you become wrapped up in the craziness of all the distractions from the cast of characters such as Autobahn that are thrown into the mix.  So when the story ends, you feel like the Dude; someone who just drifted along as everything sort of passed right by you. But worrying about all of it would be very un-Dude.",

""The Big Lebowski"" is like an answer to my prayers.  This is a comedy that works in ALL aspects.  Sometimes you have a comedy that's funny, but the writing's terrible and the talented cast is pretty much the only asset that keeps it moving.  This movie not only has a great cast, but it's wonderfully written (by those genius Coen Brothers), lavishly directed and contains a remarkable soundtrack.  Each and every character has a quirky, notable personality.  My favorite, though he only appeared on screen for about 5 minutes, was Jesus Quintana (played masterfully by John Turturro).  He cracked me up so hard!!!  And I love that scene where Jesus goes up to bowl, licks the ball for good luck and we watch in slow-motion as he hits a strike.  He dances in the lane and rejoices, while we hear a Mariachi version of the famous ""Hotel California"" in the background.  Only the Coen Brothers can make a scene work that smoothly. There are other memorable sequences, like the musical number called ""Gutterballs"" with Jeff Bridges being handed a pair of bowling shoes by Sadam Hussein and flying under the skirts of beautiful women.

But with the film as a whole there's a bit of a divergence. The film itself is basically fine. With the exception of a few specifics the story isn't that original but what is unique in this story is the strong central characters (The Dude) reaction to/and handling of those situations and scenarios.

A case of mistaken identity is what forces the Dude to react (first to get reparations for his soiled rug and secondly to assist in the recovery of Bunny Lebowski) and a torrid tale of plot twists ensues. The Coen brothers are master story tellers that love to tell dark tales that focus on the internal truths of human nature. They do not give us heroes, but instead present us with realistic characters that possess questionable morals as seen in some of their other films like No Country for Old Men, Fargo and more recently The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. The Big Lebowski is no exception as every character introduced possesses some form of character flaw.

It's a black comedy with humor that is clever and really works and will grab your amusement till it's over. And even when it's over I couldn't help but think about certain scenes in this movie because of the memorable characters. It's a brash comedy but all the elements work well together in this. Because of this film Jeff Bridges will forever be known as The Dude. The Dude is this really mellow and laid back guy who isn't that bright or ambitious of a person. In fact he is unemployed and lazy while drinking White Russian but I couldn't help but like the guy. Also how he deals with his surrounding and his ""what the heck"" expressions is just priceless. He sort of reminded me of Homer Simpson from ""The Simpsons"". And adds a lot of humor to this film. The story is basically about a Dude that gets tangled up in a situation because of a certain coincidence and becomes sort of a kidnapping investigation and the people around him constantly makes the situation worse for the guy. This is a very humorous comedy with quite a bit of satire that works. And has bunch of scenarios that interconnect very well near the end. John Goodman is also in this film and The Dude's best friend...Well only friend. And he plays this obnoxious loose-cannon type of character and he will probably forever be known for his role in this as well. Overall if you like Coen brothers film or even a great humorous film make sure to check this one out. I wanted to get myself a White Russian drink after this film.",

The titular protagonist of this thriller is a heavyweight business tycoon, a Korean veteran war-hero, disabled but not crippled, with a charming daughter and a devoted second wife, famous for his charitable enterprises. He has an alias, who might be known as the Sherlock Holmes of Los Angeles, an amateur gentleman sleuth with the professional well-honed acumen of someone with a naturally keen intellect. This is no dud, but a man of intrepid action, ably supported by the Alley Irregulars, a couple of great-hearted associates who help him solve the mysteries at the centre of the epic, and who bravely face up to a gang of demented blackmailers and foul extortionists. There are many twists and turns and surprises along the way. What was the significance of the phantom kidnapping? How did the Hollywood big-shot producer get involved? Why did the Police Chief put his hat on before throwing a right hook? Why was the central piece de resistance of the tastefully furnished, state-of-the-art apartment micturated upon?",

289,4 August 2004,CelluloidRehab,9, El Dude.....,"This movie seems to be a Raymond Chandler type gumshoe film noir story, except the Philip Marlow protagonist is substituted for ""the Dude"". While Philip Marlow is a suave, yet tough private dick who wears a suit, the Dude is 40+ year old stoner who likes to bowl and wears mostly boxer shorts and a robe (also pays for items costing less than 1 dollar with a check). The story starts out with two henchmen breaking into the Dude's house (mistaking him for a man with a similar name) to collect a debt. Figuring out they had sought the wrong Lebowski, they leave a little reminder of the break in, namely they piss on his carpet (which held the room together). From here the movie takes some unexpectedly wild, yet quite comical turns. The Dude is usually surrounded by his buddies, Walter and Donny. Walter is a slightly unstable, Jewish (converted) ex-Vietnam veteran, while Donny is the proverbial 3rd wheel. This movie is just pure fun. I could not stop laughing the whole movie. The situations are just wild and the Dude's dealing with them is even better. I recommend watching this movie with friends, and with lots of Kahlua, Vodka and milk on hand (AHHHHH.

290,4 March 2008,jboothmillard,7, The Big Lebowski,"With the recent win at the Oscars for writing/directing brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, for No Country For Old Men, it was appropriate that some of their films be on TV, and this one was pretty good. Basically Jeffrey 'The Dude' Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is an ageing hippie, and mistaken for another Jeffrey Lebowski, aka The Big Lebowski (David Huddlestone) who is a millionaire, by two thugs who pee on his carpet. The Dude is then drawn into a kidnap (possibly because of the mistaken identity) of The Big Lebowski's wife, Bunny (American Pie's Tara Reid). It seems that many other people, not just the kidnappers, want something from The Dude, and all probably because they think he's the millionaire. For me, what kept me watching was the great performance by John Goodman as The Dude's aggressive bowling buddy, Walter Sobchak, a bear-like Vietnam-veteran with a serious temper, and a bit of a potty mouth. Also starring Julianne Moore as Maude Lebowski, Steve Buscemi as Theodore Donald 'Donny' Kerabatsos, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Brandt, John Turturro as Jesus Quintana, Harry Potter's David Thewlis as Knox Harrington and Sam Elliott as The Stranger (the one narrating).

The Coen brothers are incapable of making a boring film, and this was no exception. Whether it's a great film (Fargo, Blood Simple, No Country for Old Men, Miller's Crossing, to name a few) or merely a puzzling one (Barton Fink comes to mind), their films are inventive, interesting, and memorable. Lebowski is closer to Barton Fink than the great films. There were many wonderful scenes, lines, and performances. However, to me, the overall effect was less than the sum of the parts. Even putting aside the numerous plot holes (because this film was clearly not about its plot), I found myself waiting for some narrative thread or theme to tie together the nearly random eccentric scenes.

This movie strikes a certain parallel between bowling and real life, being the story of the misadventures of Jeffrey Lebowski (and Jeff Bridges performs a good role at it) caused by the fact that he has got the same name as a famous wealthy man which gets him into a lot of trouble narrated in a series of tragicomic episodes along with his two bowling pals one of them pretending to be a very smart guy but who only brings more trouble to our Lebowski man. Some of these episodes are funny indeed and are the best part of the movie since the story itself isn't worth much. Some others are not so funny including the one of an unnecessary death because death is rarely funny. The dialogues could be funnier if they didn't abuse of a well-known obscene four letter word which is repeated about three times in every five word sentence. I am no moralist at all but never could find any humour or aesthetic value in four letter words. I neither condemn nor approve of them; they just don't make me vibrate at all leaving me totally indifferent. They are only necessary in a work of art when they serve the purpose of defining someone's character. Is that the case here? In conclusion we can say that it's a lukewarm comedy lacking vibration.",

Acting was so over the top in the pursuit of lampooning stereotypes, that I failed to see the humor. I suppose some of the action was meant to be slapstick but only seemed stupid. The movie was so gratuitously laced with obscenities throughout that it seemed to serve no purpose and lost its shock value after the first couple of minutes. The only redeeming value of this movie are some of the interesting camera shots like the bowling ball cam and some of the hallucinatory dream sequences (and the soundtrack).

Whether Bridges likes it or not, he will always be a symbol of the rebellious counterculture. As his close friend Walter Sobchak, John Goodman is obnoxiously hilarious, whether he is whining about the buddies that he lost in Vietnam or his pseudo Jewish heritage, and John Turturro is just as outrageous as a weaselly sexual predator.

310,30 April 2013,tbills2,9, The Dude sure does rule,"The Big Lebowski is a laugh-out-loud comedy, one of the all-time greats. While it may not be so uproarious as other comedy classics like Caddyshack or Dumb & Dumber, one thing distinguishes it from the lot making it special, it's actually good. It's a good movie. It is good in the dramatic sense. That puts it in rare company with flicks such as Raising Arizona. If there were only some link tying those two...Oh! The Coen Brothers! What a coincidence, these fellows are unbelievable! Someone might consider giving these two an award or some sort of a commemorative plaque. Ethan and Joel know their stuff. Watching The Big Lebowski and expecting a workable storyline or plausible happenings would be missing the point entirely. The true splendor of this film lies in the viewing ebbs and flows, the sweet spiritual journey endured, dipping into a tranquil pool of camaraderie and tolerance while emerging a cooler, wiser person. The Big Lebowski is fully enriched with life-learning moments. Take it from The Stranger if not from me. Sam Elliot's narration is great. The pacing of the film is precise. The writing of dialogue and the characters themselves are stupendous. The acting is first rate. Jeff Bridges gets the role of a lifetime playing The Dude. John Goodman is unforgettable as Walter. John Turturro as Jesus is so funny. The enjoyable experience of The Big Lebowski is simply lovely.",

I am not even that much of a hard-to-convince woman. The Big Lebowski seems to be loved by many. It starts out promising, and at some point throughout the film, ""The Dude's"" gimmick didn't really tick me off. But what went so wrong with this movie is the plot that went downhill around half-way through the movie.
You get to realize, it's a wasted opportunity, and nothing really is going to happen. The end if very anti-climatic, and there are a lot of scenes that contribute nothing, absolutely nothing, to the plot, nor the humour.",

The film is easily digested, and it is a belly buster.  Jeff Bridges plays The Dude, a Lebowski with charm who is a Los Angeles hobo.  He is assaulted by thugs at the beginning of the film.  His bowling buddy, John Goodman, Walter, is hysterically funny.  They have adventures that test the limits of humor. One should sit back and relax and really enjoy the casual presentation.  The drama is charming.  The characters are lovable.  The cinematography is excellent.  Even though it is a comedy, it has the feel of a fantasy with episodes of cartoon like floating through the sky by our protagonist.  This is a classic and should be in the DVD file of true film buffs.",
315,8 March 2018,Blue-Grotto,10, Time and Place for Everyone; Even the Dude,"Intruders break into the modest Los Angeles apartment of Jeff ""the Dude"" Lebowski. He is roughed up, money is demanded of him that he does not have, his head is unceremoniously swirled in the toilet and the toughs threaten to return, but they have the wrong Lebowski! This simple case of mistaken identity leads to a comedy of errors involving a kidnapping, a million-dollar ransom, Jesus in a purple bowling suit, a duffel bag full of dirty undies, an attack ferret and even a spicy bowling themed dream sequence. The Dude is inept, lazy and hopeless, but there is a time and place for everyone. He is in way over his head, yet so is everyone else.
 
20 years after its release and the film still one of my all-time favorites. It was my first Coen brothers film. Their brilliance and originality is instantly recognizable. The story and characters are full of delightful depth and details, the writing is witty and consistently dazzling, there is never a dull moment, and on top of everything it is really, really funny. At times I could hardly breath I was laughing so hard. Among such moments is the confrontation with the ferret, the parking lot skirmish heart attack and the bowling rants and taunts of Jesus.
 
Finding balance is one thing the Coen brothers excel at. Each character has offsetting strengths and weaknesses, every setting is shown in wondrous light as well as the shadows, and nothing is beyond reproach. No one and nothing is put on a pedestal, or trashed without a fair fight. The casting of Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, Philip Seymour Hoffman and John Turturro is brilliant. The Coens have such amazing insight into the American character; rich and poor, country and city, women and men, and cultured or not. They cut across boundaries, religions, philosophies, regions and political persuasions, and they do it seamlessly and randomly as a tumbling tumbleweed and as unlikely as a bowling alley prophet!",

Jeff Bridges plays a convincing White Russian- drinking stoner to perfection and John Goodman (a Coen brothers staple) is the main f-bomb-dropping perpetrator, with John Torturro (another Coen bros favorite) showing a true love for his bowling ball. A riot. Phillip Seymour Hoffman has a delightful sort-of cameo as well, especially in his reaction to ""Bunny"" making a suggestive offer to ""The Dude"" Bridges.

Those who find it stupid, boring, for potheads only, etc... well, I can only feel sorry for them. They're missing something fundamental.

Following on the heals of the acclaimed hit Fargo, The Big Lebowski is cut from the same irreverent mold as its predecessor. It concerns the adventures of ""The Dude"", an incredibly lazy hippie bowler with no aspirations who just can't stay out of trouble. As with all Coen films, the performances and writing are first rate, especially Jeff Bridges as ""The Dude"" and John Goodman as his violently unstable bowling partner. The humor is definitely not for everybody, but the people who don't like it will probably steer clear anyway. I'll just say you'll probably find yourself laughing for all the wrong reasons.

Plus, this is all unified by spiritual messages of surrender. These ingredients could've been messy, but the Coens find balance, subtly suggesting themes with potent details.

346,14 August 2021,x_manicure_x,8, Never gets old,"""The Big Lebowski"" is not the funniest surreal comedy, but is at least the weirdest film noir I have ever seen. It has all elements of a ""The Big Sleep"" kind of investigation, but with the most bizarre characters and a grotesque sarcasm typical of late postmodern cinema. The humor comes from the absurd situations and especially the quirky dialogues, but, as with most black comedies, it's more of a chuckling quietly to yourself rather than laughing out loud experience. As a whole, the film felt a bit too episodical if not even pointless at times: the Coen Brother pointed out that the plot is not the focus, but they could have done at least a little better in that sense. Once the case gets abruptly resolved, there is really nothing that ties all the scenes together, however memorable each individual moment might have been.

Above par upon first viewing, but the replay value is unmatchable and will eventually wind up at the top of your favorite comedies.

The double-dealing twists and turns can't hold a candle to the level of intrigue in Miller's Crossing (nor the humor, which is mostly missing in Lebowski), nor does it have the dramatic photography of Fargo, which it resembles quite closely in both plot and tone, to keep it interesting.  It is a luke-warm film that could have easily been directed and written by any of a dozen writer/directors out there.  While there are a few quotes, they are fairly few and far between, and do not stand on their own in any meaningful way (and to all you who think ""The Dude abides"" is a great quote, then you know why I call this the lowest common denominator).

It is one of those few movies where almost every line is quotable and easily recognizable. Unlike most comedies (if you could call it such) the story is both followable and enjoyable.

I had already seen several Coen Brothers films before seeing this movie, including the masterpiece Fargo and the hilarious Raising Arizona, so I had high expectations going in. These expectations were more than exceeded; they were shattered by non-stop laughter. John Goodman gives perhaps the funniest performance in any movie I've ever seen and Jeff Bridges IS the Dude; nobody else could have played that role. The day after seeing it for the first time I watched it again, and it was even funnier than the first time, if that is possible. In the multiple viewings since then, I am still laughing out loud and finding new quotable lines. The Big Lebowski is rare in that it is not just hysterical but it is also smart. While I enjoy stupid comedies like Zoolander and Dumb and Dumber, it is so much better when the humor is both hilarious and clever.

There are numerous diversions, but the main plot is a take on ransom films. The film would have been a massive failure if not for some key performances. Jeff Bridges is The Dude, a.k.a. Jeff Lebowski, who is mistaken for a millionaire of the same name whose wife owes money to a pornographer. The Dude is an unemployed layabout who bowls with his two friends Walter and Donny. Walter is played by John Goodman, who portrays the character as a short-tempered Vietnam vet who uses his military service to justify his behavior. He constantly yells at Donny (Steve Buscemi) for no real reason, and waves guns at minor bowling infractions. The Dude finds himself caught up in the Big Lebowski's ransom as the millionaire hires him to give the ransom to the kidnappers. The millionaire's aide is Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who plays a sycophantic named Brandt. Hoffman is the third most enjoyable character in the film, with his forced laugh and yes-man lines.",

And in fact, people like Dude, Walter and Donnie can often be found in various segments of the population in any country, whether it be the States or Russia.

Very loosely based on real people and stories, this movie is full of details, subtle references and jokes. In fact, it's impossible to catch them all in just one viewing. Every time I watch this masterpiece, I always find something new. Thus, the Big Lebowski has the biggest re-watch value I've ever seen in a movie. Another astonishing thing is that almost all of the dialogue in the movie (besides one sentence that was ad-libbed) was written in the script. Which is fascinating since the F-word or a variation of the F-word is used 292 times; the word ""dude"" is used around 161 times and The Dude says the word 'man' 147 times through the movie. With these two elements in mind, there is no doubt that the Coen brothers are absolutely marvelous screenwriters. And The Big Lebowski is their best movie to date.",

Unpredictable and free spirited, the ""Dude"", our protagonist gets caught in a web of intrigue. This intrigue seemingly and annoyingly takes him away from his happy life of apathy, unemployment and bowling. THE BIG LEBOWSKI is strictly Coen Brothers madness, in the vein of RAISING ARIZONA. The visuals, dream sequences, et al, are very funny and fit well in the movie. Unfortunately, the last half starts to slow down, as the characters start to seem repetitive in their reactions. The humor also waned, due to this, and the plot, not the film's strong suit to begin with, wears down with it. THE BIG LEBOWSKI is still yards ahead of most mainstream releases, yet we've grown rather accustomed (even spoiled) to expect so much more from the Coens. Recommended.",

The Dude gets mixed up with these events when gangsters break into his apartment and demands money from him until they realised they got the wrong Lebowski.

One thing I love about this movie that I haven't heard anybody else say is that the movie had thee perfect music to it. Fantastic music throughout the whole film. My favorite characters were The Dude (Of course) Walter and Donny. I am a fan of all three of the actors who played those parts, Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and Steve Buscemi. Poor Donny was always being told to shut up by Walter. The Dude was mixed up in the other Jeffery Lebowski's problems and Walter threw his undies out the car window and wants them back from those Nazis. Those three pal's sport was bowling. I've actually enjoy it as well. Some other people I had noticed in the movie were Tara Reid as Bunny, Dom Irrera as the driver and Jack Kehler as Marty. I'm also fans of them.

405,16 September 2010,estebangonzalez10,8, Dude what a good movie!,"What a strange film, but heck it is funny and grabs your attention from the opening scene. Only the Coen brothers can get away with a movie like this thanks to a very smart script and great performances from the entire cast. I think that The Coen brothers are the best at casting the right actors for the right parts because every actor seems to make their best film in a movie directed by the Coens. Jeff Bridges gives one of his best performances as The Dude, a very complex character who seems to live his life playing bowling, smoking weed, and drinking white vodka all the time. Then there is John Goodman who gives his best performance to date as well with his character who has some anger management issues and always lives in the past reminding everyone when he gets the chance that he is a Vietnam war veteran. Steve Buscemi plays a completely different role from the ones he is used to playing, he does not even talk that much this time around. And finally John Turturro who had a very small part playing a Hispanic pedophile named Jesus but who was just hilarious in every scene. This is not your typical buddy comedy, this is much more than that, it takes things from different genres and makes this a completely original comedy. Even the strange dream sequences serve as a sort of lowering and rising the curtains for the next act. You cannot have a successful comedy without a good script and The Big Lebowski has an excellent and funny script. This is my favorite Coen comedy and will always be the standard for their future comedies. Who else could make a movie about a man trying to get his rug back and making it so complex. With other movies such as Fargo and No Country for Old Men, the brothers prove they can direct any film genre.",

Lebowski (not to be confused with that Mr. Lebowski), is one of the most interesting characters in cinema, a jobless drifter who has nothing going on with his life, mistakenly placed amongst people and a society that does not appreciate the beauty of his character. The film portrays a nihilistic view on life, a showcase of how meaningless life is, just like the drama and conflicts that unfolds in the story. The life Lebowski leads might not appeal to everyone, but we should all learn a thing or two from the the way he speaks, deeply rooted in a socially unacceptable philosophy that upon second thought yields more happiness than most. Why take life so seriously when deep down it is such a amorphous ridiculous mess that points nowhere? Do you agree with Lebowski? How can you apply his philosophies in real life where the stakes both smaller and higher than in Lebowski's fictional world of 90s LA? These are only a few of the questions this film inspire in its audience. In a weird way, The Big Lebowski makes for quite a touching film, and the way it does so is to make you reevaluate the attitude with which you lived your life until then. How is the truth about life, hidden in plain sight, so simple and yet so easily shunned?",

This becomes especially clear in the legendary interactions and dialogues between him and his bowling collegue Walter. Every single scene of the film is crazy, funny and definitely unique.

'The Big Lebowski' is the best film ever and by reading many of the other IMDb comments I can see I am certainly not alone in that opinion. There are a few reasons why I happen to believe this to be numero uno. The dialogue in this film surpasses even that of 'Pulp Fiction'. Almost every line of the script is pure gold and if it does not bring the merest chuckle out of you then you are rolling around on the floor in fits of laughter.,
421,9 May 2006,LuckyGraveyardBoots,10, THE best comedy I've seen in my life,"AWESOME. Seriously, this was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I have no idea what it's about, but I liked it. I kind of detected a 'circle of life' thing...in the world of L.A. slackers, everything works out, man, don't worry. Donnie dies, little Lebowski is born. Thus it continues. But you don't watch this for the message. It's got an excuse for a plot, at least: Big Lebowski's wife owes money to crooks and is kidnapped. 'The Dude' Lebowski is mistaken for the millionaire by the same name and his carpet is pi$$ed upon in a misunderstanding. Seeking compensation for the rug (which really tied the room together) he ends up commissioned to deal with the crooks. Introduce a trio of Nihilists (with marmot), a half-crazed feminist painter (Julianne Moore), a porno film industry and a gay pedophile who's extremely competitive about bowling (John Turturro) and you've got it...the ultimate stoned slacker comedy. Jeff Bridges is far out as The Dude, and hilariously understated, while John Goodman is his psychotically violent 'Nam vet best friend, who carries a piece to a bowling alley, and John Turturro is forever etched into my memory as Jesus Quintana (spoken to Walter: ""You got a date for Wednesday, baby! Whoo!"" Walter: ""...He's cracking."") Steve Buscemi was adorably pathetic as Donnie, the third wheel. One of the best quotes: Donnie: Are these the Nazis, Walter? Walter: No, Donnie, these men are Nihilists. There's nothing to be afraid of. It was very memorable, with excellent characters which is basically all that made it worth watching...the Coen's signature style doesn't come through here like it does in Fargo, and it's not overly artistic (well...in parts maybe) but it's so funny! Excellent, excellent. Especially The Dude's stoned dreams (which feature Saddam Hussein renting out bowling shoes).",

Dude then enlists the help of his friend, who is a little off his rocker and screws all the plans up each time. Dude also encounters with Mr. Lebowski's Daughter who knows that her father is embezzling money from the company. She tries to catch him by paying Dude $20,000 to bring her the money that he was given in order to give to Bunny's kidnappers. However, the briefcase is also empty and only has some telephone books in it for weight. Later, they find out that Bunny was never kidnapped; she was off visiting friends and returned home safely.

As others have said it really does get funnier each time you watch it, probably because you have to know the characters to appreciate much of the humor and because during the first viewing you are burning too much mental energy trying to follow the relatively complex plot (while not as complex as ""Miller's Crossing"" it still challenges viewers to pay close attention).

For me The comedies of the Coen brothers are much better than the thrillers like Simple Blood or MIller's Crossing and in the Big Lebowski they create a very funny role that was excellent plays by Jeff Bridges. The story is kind of simple: a man is confused by other man that has the same name and he is in a big trouble. But whats makes great this films is the actors and the funny touch of the directors.... Jonh Goodman and Steve Buscemi are just excellent, also Phillip Seymor Hoffman in a little role is excellent and other fact that i love in this film is that Flea from the RHCP has a participation (very little) in the film and i love the music of the RHCP. About the funniest dialogs and scenes in the film: well there are a lot but i love the scene when Walter put his gun in Somkey's head and other of Walter in when he gets angry because of the Shomer Shabbos. Of The Dude, they are a lot but i love when he says his versions of the kidnapping to The big Lebowski and also when he crash in his car. Donny...well Donny is funny in all his scenes and dialogs but when he says Lennon about Lennin is just great. All this parts of the film are great but the best is when Walter throws the bottle to the air with the rest of Donny. Other great character is Jesus and Jonh Turturro is excellent..............let me tell you something pendejo (his best dialog).",

432,30 April 2020,LeonardKniffel,6, The Occasional Acid Flashback,"The thing about movies made by the Coen Brothers is that I either love them (Fargo) or they leave me flat (The Big Lebowski). There is a thin line between comic and tragic, and here the lead characters never find it. As played by Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, two dumber Polacks have never graced the silver screen. Yet, there is nothing Polish or Polish-American about these losers---""The Dude"" Lebowski and Walter Sobchak-except their names, and ""Sobchak"" is a very un-Polish spelling. There are a couple of assumptions that you have to make to laugh at the jokes in this 1998 film. One is that Polish surnames are innately funny and you should laugh when you hear one, especially when it is associated with intelligent thought or combined with an American given name (""Bunny Lebowski""). The only time you hear the word ""Polish"" in the movie is when The Dude explains to Sobchak that he is ""not even Jewish"": ""You're f---ing Polish-Catholic."" So why see this film? Because it raises a lot of questions, such as: What's so funny about stupidity? Why does John Goodman seem to be doing an imitation of Roseanne Barr? Would this have worked better as a cartoon? Why is ""Lebowski"" considered a ""jerk-off name""? Another reason is to watch Julianne Moore deliver another bizarre but intriguing performance. As Maude Lebowski, she leads The Dude, a burned-out hippie, into the only one of his lines that made me laugh out loud by asking him post-coitally what he does for recreation. As if it's the first time he's ever been asked, he thinks for a second, then replies, ""Go bowling, drive around, and the occasional acid flashback.""",

It's apparently tipping off the audience that it's an homage or a satire on The Big Sleep: the two daughters, the father in a wheelchair, the blackmail. This film steals so many themes from so many movies I lost count. It doesn't work as a mystery, a comedy, or a satire and once you get through the first 40 minutes you really wonder what you watched.

This black comedy starring Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and Steve Buscemi, is a movie that did not perform well with critics nor saw much sunshine at the box office,; but eventually went on to becoming a cult classic and one of the my favorite comedies to date. This film follows Jeff Lebowski (played by Jeff Bridges), a drifter who lives under the name ""The Dude"" as his name happens to be the same name as a billionaire. To matters worse, this billionaire is married to a woman who is in serious debt and owes money to some of the most dangerous individuals in Los Angeles. With The Dude mistaken as the billionaire (played by David Huddleston), the Lebowksi's wife Bunny Lebowski (played by Tara Reid) is kidnapped by the dangerous men and orders The Dude to get their money. With the help of his bowling buddies Walter Sobchak (played by John Goodman) and Donny Kerabatsos (played by Steve Buscemi), his plan makes a turn for the worst when he gets involved a series of dangerous schemes including corrupt police officers and Lebowkski's erotic daughter Maude (played by Julianne Moore).",

Jeff Bridges is here in his most iconic role and the addition of John Goodman is perfect, their chemistry is phenomenal.

446,12 November 2007,xredgarnetx,6, Fun for the guys,"I am one of those who think the Coen Brothers have done better movies than THE BIG LEBOWSKI. But I will give it this: This satiric tale of mistaken identity, kidnap and death has a Raymond Chandler-esquire feel that should certainly appeal to male viewers. Jeff Bridges is Dude Lebowski, who ends up being mixed up with a millionaire with the same last name (David Huddleston) who owes money to some very bad men. The Dude's best buddy, Walter (John Goodman) helps The Dude in his quest to find the senior Lebowski's hormone-crazed child bride (Tara Reid), who has done a disappearing act and may or may not have been kidnapped. The film is bizarre, to say the least, with Busby Berkley-type fantasy sequences, Bridges as a '60s burnout with long, unkempt hair and Goodman as an individual with serious anger management issues. Bridges and Goodman make the film worth watching, although their constant use of expletives may turn off some. They are supported in their efforts by Steve Buscemi as their strange pal Donny and Julianne Moore as the even stranger Maude Lebowski. Sam Elliott serves as the film's narrator and shows up in a brief sequence. This is quite probably Goodman's finest film, by the way.",

Never would I have conscidered a film like that be that kind of a film I would conscider one of my personal top ten favorite films of all time. So what is it that makes it so lovable? To be honest, I didn't truly get it the first time I saw it, that can be because how young I was the first time I saw it. I have though grown very fond of it later on, for now to be conscidered one of my all time favorites, and I think it has all to do with the deliverance. The acting is great, the scenario is ridiculous and the plot is overly complicated, yet that's the reason the film works that well. I am the type of person who loves roundedness in storytelling, where conflicts are resolved in a peculiar manner. This film offers this in a sense, yet also not at all. I was very confused about the ending the first time I saw the film because there are several story lines that are never further explored as the credits roll. I didn't really like this way to end the film the first time I saw it, but I have realized over the time how brilliant it really is. First of all because of our main character, Jeffrey ""The Dude"" Lebowski. We are following his story, yet as all of our stories, it will include the story of others. Throughout the film we meet sorts of different people, whom The Dude has something to do with, we get a glimpse of their stories, but not the resolution of them, this may be because it's not something The Dude actually cares about, because the rest of those stories are not something that involves him. To quote the dude, quoting Lenin; ""You look for the person who will benefit, and, uh, you know what I'm trying to say.""",

It is a sad reflection on today's society that writers and producers think that it is not possible to yet a laugh without lacing the dialog with obscenities in place of conjunctions.

This film does have a decent plot although not one you'd consider to be sensational. The main reason behind this film's popularity is it's script and characters. The performances in this film are flawless. Each actor is sensational and it honestly baffles me how there was no Oscar nods for any performances, or Oscar nods for anything at all. The script is funny although it's not one that would have you on the floor crying with laughter. The comedy is enhanced with excellent delivery and such memorability. There was a few scenes that had me desperate for air from laughing. Particularly the ending scene and the scene in which the dude nails a block of wood to the floor and put a chair against it for protection. Only to find it's an out swinging door. I would live to quote this movie with friends with lines such as obviously you're not a golfer, the dude abides, I'm the walrus or no I don't think he was close to cracking, but because of my age (I'm 16) it's rare people would understand what I'm saying and would just end up looking at me like I'm insane.

Actually, it is a very finely crafted movie even if it looks as if they were running out of film and just tied everything up in the last reel. I am so glad it came out on DVD as it gives you the opportunity to pick up other bits and pieces that seem almost secondary (well, actually they are but who cares). Like in the opening scene where the Dude's head is shoved down the toilet after he bashed his bowling ball against the door jam. If you notice the dent left is still there all through the film. It's a small thing but one that make the whole movie a gem. Jeff Bridges IS the Dude (and a biliiant piece of acting to explain to the Big Labowski that she (Bunny) kidnaped herself). Both Goodman and Stevie are perfectly cast and Johnny T. is just perfect as the Jesus. Like Stone's ""Any Given Sunday"", this movie bases itself in a sport for which I have no interest but, boy, what a movie. I have to give this 9 out of 10 as it is only the Coen's second best movie.

His rug is ruined so he get's the help of his bowling buddies an insane Vietnam Veteran named Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and the Dude's other friend Donny Kerabotsos (Steve Buscemi) to get his ruined rug back. An innumerable number of subplots, a boatload of swearing, and some great lines are what make this film more then worthwhile. This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and everything revolves around the Dude. The Dude is a character who has accomplished very little, and does very little, but he seems to have managed himself a very happy life. And that's what really holds together. Everything (as funny as it may be) could have been left out but what you can't take out is the Dude himself. His reactions and way of doing things is what makes this worthwhile.

I just saw this movie for the first time less than 3 months ago (sometime in June or July of 2000) and I've seen it 3 or 4 times already.  I haven't seen many of the other Coen brothers movies, but I have seen ""Fargo"" (witch I have to say I wasn't all too fond of, I'll have to see it again) and I just saw ""Barton Fink"" last night.  I also saw ""Raising Arizona"" a while back and loved it.  I'd have to say from what I've seen so far ""The Big Lebowski"" is their best work yet.  I have to see ""Blood Simple"", ""Miller's Crossing"" and ""The Hudsucker Proxy"". And I'm dying to see their upcoming ""O Brother Where Art Thou"".  Anyway, if you are open to interesting comedy, please see ""The Big Lebowski"" and pay attention to every word.  Also, make sure you think about everything they say, some of the things they say are hysterical if you think about it, at first it may not seem so funny.  And one last thing, make sure you pay attention to how the characters interact with each other and put yourself in their shoes.  I love this movie!!!  Thanks for reading. -Cortex",

This film is a sure enough promise to make your worries be over after watching the movie. I thought this film was going to be stupid and sure enough it was, but also it was utterly hilarious with smart dialogue and stylish scenes. Jeff Bridges as ""The Dude"" does a terrific job in the film and his bizarre dreams are greatly acted by him. John Turturro, also, had a great role, even though he only starred in about two scenes, the introduction of him was the funniest scene of the entire movie. John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman had good roles too as well. This is a ""stupid"" funny film and that is entirely why I enjoy it, with its slapstick scenes. I liked Fargo and O Brother Where Art Thou, but this in my opinion, is the best Coen film yet. I recommend it.",

The plot to this movie isn't even that important: the way the characters react and the tone of the thing, that's what draws you into this piece. It is blissfully bizarre and probably belongs up there with Altman's The Long Goodbye and Polanski's Chinatown as a wonderful snapshot of Los Angeles wrapped in a private-eye story. Again, it isn't a riddle to be solved, just movie entertainment at its best. The initial ""mystery"" of this story is about as important to the final film as the initial ""who stole the truck"" business in the beginning of The Usual Suspects. Forget about it and listen to the Dude sponging-up vocabulary, Walter chastizing pascifism, and poor Donny always six steps behind, out of his element. Like all the Coen Brother's films, this one gets better with repeat viewings to catch every nuance in performance, dialogue, cinematography, etc.  Jeff Bridges gives his best performance since Fearless.

481,26 March 2018,shusei,2," Boring, pretentious,and highly overated","To make long story short, I don't understand what really matters in this film.
The plot is rather simple, a lazy jobless middle-aged man living in Los Angels gets in trouble only because his name is identical to the another man who looks a millionaire but in fact lives by the money of the foundation that he represents.
The plot may become interesting if the main characters have more concrete biography and have a will to live their life in such so that it would become better than the total wasting of time.
But what the authors made of the plot is the contrary. No one of the characters has a will to live otherwise, that is, they want to live only as lazy dogs with no positive or creative purpose. Their sense of justice and sense of duty is lower than average , their desire to have a lot of money without working is not motivated by any thought-out view of the world, and as a result they look very flat and boring people. 
Here the simple plot is played by very boring people and authors' effort to make simple boring story look interesting resulted in an empty demonstration of cheep and disconnected images (visions of daydreams of the main character).

483,9 March 2010,johnmschofield,10, I will always regard this film as one of my favourites,A film buff friend of mine recommended this film to me some years ago and his opinion is generally quite sound. This is the sort of film that I could watch every week and still find it superb entertainment. The film is an absolute barrel of fun throughout and the cast and crew together with the Coen brothers have produced a masterpiece. When the Monty Python experience came along in the late 1960's my dad and I used to watch it together. I was almost always helpless with laughter whereas my dad had various expressions on his face from bewilderment to boredom and suffice to say he never did not see the funny side of Python. This is another instance where he would probably be watching this film with a stony face unable or unwilling to grasp what would be so funny to me. Yes there is violence and sexual content but in my opinion it is all in context and not gratuitous but thats just my two cents. Like in a lot of other comedy films you either like them or not and I suspect that there are quite a number of people out there who just cant tune into the humour. I am fortunate in that I can tune in and apart from anything else this film stands on its own and not just a comedic exercise but as a fun story with a reasonable plot told in an unique way. I would highly recommend anyone watch this film because in my opinion there is so much to like and hopefully if you tune in you will not be disappointed,

It's hard to be objective when your first viewing of a cult movie comes 20 years after it was released. You are certain to have heard a lot about it from many people over the years and most of it was probably favorable. If it's a comedy you might expect it to be hilarious or at least funny in a quirky way. All movies age, but none age worse than comedies. Everything from set pieces to asides are creatures of their moments and usually don't remain funny 2 decades later. I've found that an exception to this rule is silent film comedies.

I never really appreciated their work since until recently when I saw both ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" and ""The Big Lebowski"", both very funny and abundantly entertaining movies. The best thing about both these movies was that I watched them each in small bits, every time for about 20-25 minutes. And when I started watching where I left off it was if as I had been watching the movie in one take, there was no ""khmm, I better rewind a couple of minutes back to remember what happened"". They were both highly enjoyable movies to watch because of their simplicity in storytelling. And although simple, the stories are always rich in detail and the two brothers are on hell of a storyteller. I have always loved the movie directors that use the same actors over and over again and then make jokes about this in their movies (the main reason I dig some Kevin Smith movies) and the Coens have a blast out of this as well. It's a homely feeling for the viewer I guess, a sort of subconscious participation and understanding of these jokes, which I find great. The feeling of ""The Big Lebowski"" is very easygoing, just as our protagonist. A great sense of musical accompaniment, great acting by each and every actor and a great sense of directing are all wonderfully presented. Plus there are many laugh out loud scenes that are truly hilarious (the scene where the character of Jesus (a roughly 3 minute Oscar-worthy performance by Turturo) is presented). Oh yeah, and a hell of a script. Simple and loads of fun.7/10",

Funny, my critics about this one are exactly the opposite of those I have about Â„O Brother, Where Art Thou?`. There, I felt they neglected the dialogue. Here, the dialogues are Coen-like (Â„Give us ze munny Lebowski or we cut off your Johnson!`) but I missed the visual fascination of earlier movies. And the story is really, really confusing. I'm not sure, if they understood it themselves. But now let me get to the positive aspects: Carter Burwell's music always works; the actors are fabulous, especially John Goodman and Â– in a completely new kind of role Â– Steve Buscemi! The Coens can be lucky to have such a well-tempered cast and crew, consisting mainly of their closer friends they have already worked with several times. Jeff Bridges is also great.

Jeff was a perfect cast for Dude as he show us skills of great acting. Walter Sobchak played by Goodman is one of the funniest characters every created as he brilliantly portraits his and does probably best role of his life in comedy.

This is basically a post-modern tale that anyone growing up in the 90's will understand. Everyone should find this entertaining, especially on re-runs on all the networks. 
It requires attention span as the story is rather complicated. It also has a great number of characters to introduce. But the filmmakers do it so well that it doesn't lose any points. 
I didn't give it a 10 because it is so outlandish and over-the-top that even the most gullible will want to walk away from it at times. There is a character, played by John Turturro, who is a registered sex offender, who plays bowling alongside the three main characters in league bowling, and they felt the need to do a cut-scene to tell his story, even though he is only in one scene. Also, there is the guy who is a stage actor, who wants the Dude to go to his performance, and the dude nearly forgets - this character has nothing at all to do with this movie, so the scenes changed about every 2 minutes!!! Also, John Goodman's character getting away with threatening to shoot someone in public, and the cops show up and somehow miss him!! Way too over-the-top.

566,22 September 2013,JPfanatic93,8, A true nonsensicomedy,"Outrageously zany, off-beat comedy the likes only the Coen Brothers can provide. Life is tough for the pot smoking all-round slacker Jeffrey Lebowski, more commonly referred to as ""The Dude"" (Jeff Bridges in one of the most defining roles of his career). Sharing his last name with a millionaire, he's victimized by thugs who mistake him for that rich man (who owes them a debt), a situation which finds his beloved rug in ruin after having been urinated upon by the perpetrators. When he visits his namesake to try and get him to pay for its cleaning, he soon gets more than he bargained for as he finds himself caught up in what appears to be a kidnap of the wealthy man's trophy wife, but swiftly explodes into a bizarre, inexplicable potpourri of events beyond anybody's control or understanding, thanks to the involvement of a host of wacky, maniacal and thoroughly enjoyable characters, ranging from feminist/nihilist artists and pornographers to White Russians and generally random folk annex narrators. Yet all The Dude asked for was a clean rug and an opportunity to win the local bowling alley's competition he trained so hard for with his two best buddies (John Goodman with severe anger management problems and Steve Buscemi who can't take a hint when he's asked to shut up). The Coens don't ask you to make sense of it all, they just want you to roll with it (pun intended), as The Dude does himself. Nevertheless, despite this absence of a clearly defined plot, or more likely because of it, The Big Lebowski proves all kinds of fun. The pair of directors used the same tactic a decade later with Burn After Reading to similar results, proving them the masters of this subgenre of 'nonsensicomedy' (for the record, I just made that term up and I hope it catches on). In both cases they were aided by an impressive cast of character actors and/or movie stars who felt like doing something different for a change, in The Big Lebowski's case including Philip Seymour Hoffman, John Turturro, Julianne Moore and Sam Elliott. Though the film was met with moderately tempered critical reviews and disappointing box office results back in 1998, time has proved the Coens right, as it has since become a widely accepted cult classic with serious tendencies towards an eventual, seemingly unavoidable shedding of the moniker 'cult'. When Burn After Reading came along in 2008, the majority of both audience and critics finally understood this type of film, and that movie did much, much better business accordingly.",

It truly is one of the most amazingly brilliant masterpieces ever made, packed with visual and verbal invention, skill and class. Every second, every frame is simply magical, from the grimy milky toilet of the opening scene through all those wonderfully colourful, crazy dream sequences to the final pan of the camera away from our heroes, a riot of colour, imagery and beauty. The story is a wonderfully rambling, sprawling tale based loosely on Raymond Chandler and old Bogey movies, packed with Chandler staples and nods to great classic film noir, the characters are all brilliantly conceived, written and played. Bridges and Goodman make a truly classic odd-buddy combination, Buscemi and Turturro play wonderful minor comic figures wonderfully, Julianna Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, David Thewlis, the list of great actors playing out of their skins goes on and on. The music is perfect, Sam Eliot's narration is awe-inspiring (who else could possibly have played that part?), but above all it is the visual splendour of every scene which makes this film really stand out. What the Coens have created here will last forever as one of the very last great cinematic achievements of the Twentieth century, and sets a standard towards which all future filmmakers will have to stretch themselves to the utmost to reach. A truly flawless film which leaves the viewer with a lasting sense of pleasure and satisfaction and even manages to improve with each successive viewing, The Big Lebowski deserves every possible award and recognition available, and should be seen by every sensible person on the planet as often as possible.

In a variety of plot twists and turns with fake kidnappings and a pornographic producer looking for his payday, somehow unfolded in it all is a movie. Mostly considered to have darker films, the Cohen Brothers take a swing at humor. Even though they very much succeed, it all goes back to how much this movie makes no sense and goes nowhere. With their more serious movies they have first and second acts with conclusions and all. With The Big Lebowski things just sort of happen and then nothing at all. By watching the movie you get embraced into their world as if going on a vacation. You go there, and then you leave Â– you might have some fun, and some laughs, and you might not.

The one character everyone knows, The Dude, is easily the highlight of this movie. He's a lazy, easygoing guy who just likes to sit back and let life happen. When he gets mixed up into a crazy, complex plot, the results are quite amusing. The second best character is Walter, a foul mouthed, angry, Vietnam veteran. He makes for some hilarious and memorable scenes. The plot to this movie is kind of all over the place. It's never hard to follow or anything, but it is everywhere. I can see people making the argument that is was a really lazy to put such little effort into the plot. If that's your opinion, I won't argue with you. However, I will disagree with you. I'd say lots of effort was put into this plot. It seems that a lot of time was put into making it so it could be complex if it wanted to, but simple if looked at from a certain point of view. That lines up perfectly with the character of The Dude. He makes the plot seem that way. He only focuses on what he cares about and ignores everything else. That is actually quite brilliant and I give major points to the Coen brothers on that one. In the end, The Big Lebowski is a hilarious film, and should be seen by everyone.",

Not so far, at least! ",

Lots of great jokes and gags, but some odd sequences that may turn some viewers off.  The movie has no real plot, just a series of short pieces that happen to have the same characters.  Everybody performs well and the characters are great - except for John Goodman's character, who gets a little bit annoying at times.  A definite must see for Coen brothers fans, but some non-fans may not buy into their sense of humor.",
577,3 May 2013,raphaklopper,9, Best...black comedy...EVER!,"When the Coens want to be funny and smart. And put violence and stupidity every passing minute. All in that in a movie, the answer is ""The Big Lebowski"". ""The Big Lebowski"" not only can be one of the best films of the Coen brothers, but also as one of the funniest movies ever made. The Coens once again manage to put all his humor and intellect in a comedy written and directed as well. Everything in the movie sound Coen material, the story itself is. When the unforgettable ""The Dude Lebowski"" (Jeff Bridges) is mistaken for a millionaire with the same surname ""Lebowski"", two thugs urinate on his rug to force him to pay a debt he did not even know. Dude seeks and finds the other ""Lebowski"" (David Huddleston), not only earned a reward for the ruined rug and also accepts a job at one time as pay-off. Dude then asks the help of his bowling buddy Walter (John Goodman), a gun-toting converted to Judaism with serious anger issues. The little work leads to a huge mess which leads to more trouble, and soon seems that everyone from the porn empire tycoons and improvised criminals want something from The Dude. The whole movie is full of Coen elements. Black humor, moments of absurd violence, but it is never a negative point in the Coen films, but a great talent, especially in its big-black comedy. And as always a fantastic direction from Joel Coen (director) with amazing shots of scenes (one example is a scene where we see the bowling ball inside of it running). And the writing as always very strong in delivering extremely funny and smart dialogs. Leaving the movie extremely entertaining to watch. When the Coen duo want to make a very funny and intelligent movie, with a fantastic direction and writing. And just with a formidable cast with phenomenal performances (especially Bridges and Goodman with very entertaining and superb performances), I must say they are the best on delivery!",
578,20 April 2015,Fandust,3, Slobbery,"A movie about a rug? Bowling buddies? Why not make a movie about a lost toothbrush and friends in a chat room? The fat slob is supposed to be entertaining. I have nothing against Jeff Bridges, I vaguely recall him from my young adulthood and I liked him in K-PAX. As the main character in this movie, his part was a slob. I don't know why this movie is rated highly. You would have to be a really great actor with lots of help from the creative departments to overcome the slobbery character. He didn't do it for me. Maybe it's the nostalgia that most people like. An actor must be enjoyable to watch, regardless of the character. This just wasn't. If you're a big fan of Jeff Bridges and you must see this movie, I hope you find it much more entertaining than I did.",

It has taken me a long time to get around to watch this movie - as it did with ""Fargo"" - but as with their other movies, I enjoyed this immensely.

""The Dude"", though, has the same name as a multi-millionaire called Jeffrey ""The Big"" Lebowski (hence the title), and when the multimillionaire owes money to a group of Nihlists (they don't believe in ANYTHING!), they mix up the two people's identities, and The Dude's carpet gets ruined because of it. The Dude then seeks restitution for his carpet, but soon becomes involved in a kidnapping involving ""The Big"" Jeffrey Lebowski's wife.

599,7 January 2005,jofitz27,8, Bizarre...?,"The Big Lebowski. One of the more bizarre movies I've seen by a long shot, this follows swearaholic Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski who is mistaken and has his rug ""soiled"" near the start of the film. Going to the intended ""soiled-rug"" person, The Dude gets himself foolishly involved in a kidnapping case in which a womans toe is cut off. Him and his buddy Walter and idiotic friend Donny (Shut the F**K up!!) Try to figure it all out. This film mainly succeeds because of the characters; John Tuturro as a ludicrous child molester, Donny and Walter, the film's high point, always finding new hilarious dialogue to spit at the camera. Had it not been for some fantastic performances from Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, this may well not be the funny thriller/slacker comedy that it was. A memorable movie, filled to the brim with politically incorrect scenes and some unusually twisted phrases and comedy, The Big Lebowski scores big. But what do you expect if it's done by the Coen Brothers?",
600,24 March 2021,Naoufel_Boucetta,8, My personal favorite comedic work by the Coen brothers,"That's entertainment. The Coen brothers gave us a gallery with diverse characters one more hilarious than the other, combined with the well crafted narrative that fits perfectly for this raw comedy and also a great set of talented cast led by Jeff Bridges. Adding on all of that the artistic mise en scÃ¨ne and the superb cinematography that made the introduction of certain characters more memorable. A true gem in the Coen's catalogue.",
601,5 February 2005,robinasselman,10, A wonderful and very funny movie,"The story of the big lebowski is as difficult as funny. It begins with a lazy man in Los Angeles who's parents named him Jef Lebowski, but he prefers if people call him ""the dude"", played magnificently by Jeff Bridges. One evening two men come into his house and confuse the dude with Jeff Lebowski, a millionaire, where they want to steal from. One of the two ""pees"" on his rug and the dude wants a new rug. That's where the trouble starts. His bowling-mates Ronny (Steve Buscemi)and Walter (John Goodman)try to help him but do more harm than good, Jeff Lebowski's wife gets kidnapped and the dude has to help her back. But is she really kidnapped, is she really his wife and what's doing Maude Lebowski(great role by Julianne Moore)in all of this? Between all this adventure they have to play a tournament and might meet the incredible Jesus (John Turturro), who is a great bowler but ""also a pervert"". The movie contains hilarious scenes and unbelievable trips and is packed with great one liners. The dude is an anti-hero who does the things his way and most of the time, that's very relaxed. It's also relaxed for us as a viewer and the dude at some way is even inspiring. Maybe the Coen brothers made with Fargo a better movie, i was caught immediately by this one and since then i seen it over and over again but i never got bored. The film is based on a friend of the Coen brothers, who called himself the dude and Jeff bridges did nothing more for to make this movie then to eat and drink. ""the easiest preparation i ever had for a role"" as he said. It proved that he did his preparation well and its actually strange he didn't even get an Oscar nomination for it. If you never like to bowl, you will love it now. ""You roll!!""",

I don't understand why is his role included as he talks senseless all the time. You cannot even laugh on what he says, even nothing special in way of talking. The same is the case with the millionaire Lebowski. He too gets irritated easily and shouts a lot. Another irritable role. Its a great sacrifice of the normal state of mind to watch this stuff.

Jeff Bridges is absolutely fantastic as ""The Dude"" a total burnout that is simply drifting through life and is caught up in an unlikely series of absolutely hysterical events. John Goodman and Steve Bushemi are outstanding as The Dude's close friends, and the exchanges between them are pure comedy gold. This is a brilliant, non-formula movie that is everything I wish Hollywood would be all the time,very funny,uniquely creative, and well acted and directed.

It follows the unlucky trail of ""The Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), an out-of-work lazy bachelor with bowling and doing drugs his only hobbies.  One night he comes home to goons who dunk him in his toilet and pee on his rug.  They leave when they find out that the man they're trying to get money from is a different Lebowski, a millionaire (Dave Huddleston) whose wife owes money all over town.  Dude goes to Lebowski's house and takes a rug, despite Lebowski's rage at Dude for being a slacker.  From there on, the movie gets more and more confusing, with more and more plot twists and characters added.

I couldn't even watch it in one go. Had to take a nap midway and then continue afterwards. Acting-wise, it's pretty good, especially with the Lebowski dude. But that wasn't enough to save this snore-fest. It just felt like a journey with no sensible destination. And it did end quite senselessly too.

639,12 September 2021,YellowTea,7," A ""Nothing"" Movie With a Quiet Charm","I'd long heard about The Big Lebowski, rave reviews in fact. It was roundly dubbed as one of the few ""movies that you must see before you die."" It has apparently even spawned a legitimate religion, or ""way of life"", called Dudeism, based around the central character, The Dude. I thought to myself, any movie that can spawn a religion, or movement, surely must be worth watching. Now, I wouldn't say that it's not worth watching, but I wouldn't consider it one of the greatest movies of all time. As the title of this review states, it's not without its charm and does have moments that will make you laugh - several of the scenes with The Dude come to mind, such as when he's in the bathtub and the German nihilists break in and toss a ""marmot"" (was that a marmot or a ferret?) in with him. Jeff Bridges' girlish screams are real chucklers. In addition to this scene, I would also list The Dude's speech patterns and mannerisms as being part of the successful comedic devices. I didn't much care for John Goodman's character, or any of the others. This movie really was all about The Dude, and the others added very little to the film.

I can see why people think the dialogue is clever/genius, but I found myself somewhat exhausted with having to explain to myself what was going on and repeating the lines/things in my head and saying ""see that is why that is funny"" and so on and so forth. It just wasn't naturally amusing, fleshed out the way it maybe could have, and required a lot of effort and in-your-head translation of sorts. This movie never appealed to me and I've avoided it over the years which I am usually correct in doing. This is my 4th or 5th viewing and it is still very tiresome and no I have not laughed once. I mean, I love Jeff Bridges, so I keep watching. But I can't praise this movie like so many people do. I find myself repeatedly wondering what the writers were trying to accomplish and that maybe it wasn't accomplished by the actors, or something. Maybe it was better accomplished in writing than it was in film. I do not know. I mean... I'm not stupid, I get the jokes... and I have smiled a lot watching this, but there is much about it that is tiresome/draining.

649,12 January 2005,velvets203,9, Coen Brothers comedic masterpiece,"Even with Raising Arizona on their cinematic belts, the Coen Brothers made their comedic masterpiece in this triumph of a comedic movie. (Is it the highest rated comedy on the top 250??) This movie defined my college years, as people had ""Lebowski parties"" with White Russians, (etc) and the movie going the whole time. People just could not stop watching and re-watching this movie. Instead of the typical slapstick, gross out, or physical comedy that has so dominated movies since the 1990's, BL uses slick writing, creative characters, and a convoluted, but fun plot to make the audience laugh. No lame sex jokes or tense moments between a female and male, nothing forced or built up to force us into laughing; just good old fashioned hilarity. The entire movie has become quotable, with John Goodman providing most of the lines with his over the top character. It is such a classic that I know many a person who knows the entire script almost line for line, like it's Star Wars or some other cult movie. It even makes Jeff Bridges always seem to be ""the Dude"" to me now, even when I see him in movies he performed in well before this movie. All the actors put in fine performances, with Steve Buscemi and John Turturro making their regular Coen Brothers appearances. Some people may take this movie too seriously, and I am sure if one does one would scoff at its high ranking. But don't let yourself become a cinematic elitist, just relax, and realize that this is one of the reasons why people make such a big deal about the Coen Brothers. A unique film that deserves credit for taking chances, but for also being intelligently written. Incredible laughs, and relevant, caring characters force me to give this a 9, or A-",

Steve is absolutely, stunningly wonderful! And of course, John Goodman is, once again, one of our ten best actors. The most suprising element of this film is how good Jeff Bridges is in this. Why this movie did not get the critical acclamation that Barton Fink and Fargo got, escapes me completely. I truly enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it. Most poignant for me was the archetypical hypocrisy of the 'can do' right wing doppelganger of 'the dude', which is seemingly self-evident to the general public or it wouldn't have been characterised with such nonchalance.

The plot of the movie is virtually nonexistent, and the dialogue is horrendous, mostly consisting of the f-word.

While most of their previous work has been critically acclaimed, it wasn't truly until 'Fargo' that the pair became more universally known.  'The Big Lebowski' is proof that the duo have past a rare test.  They have transferred their concept of quirky filmmaking to the mainstream, while retaining their biting sense of humor.

678,28 March 2012,frank-edward,10, Awesome just awesome!,"I would say that ""Big Lebowski"" has to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and I have seen a LOT. There is kind of a 'circle of life' thing...in the world of L.A. slackers, everything works out, man, don't worry. Donnie dies, little Lebowski is born. Thus it continues. But you don't watch this for the message. It's got an excuse for a plot, at least: Big Lebowski's wife owes money to crooks and is kidnapped. 'The Dude' Lebowski is mistaken for the millionaire by the same name and his carpet is pi$$ed upon in a misunderstanding. Seeking compensation for the rug (which really tied the room together) he ends up commissioned to deal with the crooks. Introduce a trio of Nihilists (with marmot), a half-crazed feminist painter (Julianne Moore), a porno film industry and a gay pedophile who's extremely competitive about bowling (John Turturro) and you've got it...the ultimate stoned slacker comedy. Jeff Bridges is far out as The Dude, and hilariously understated, while John Goodman is his psychotically violent 'Nam vet best friend, who carries a piece to a bowling alley, and John Turturro is forever etched into my memory as Jesus Quintana (spoken to Walter: ""You got a date for Wednesday, baby! Whoo!"" Walter: ""...He's cracking."") Steve Buscemi was adorably pathetic as Donnie, the third wheel. One of the best quotes: Donnie: Are these the Nazis, Walter? Walter: No, Donnie, these men are Nihilists. There's nothing to be afraid of. It was very memorable, with excellent characters which is basically all that made it worth watching...the Coen's signature style doesn't come through here like it does in Fargo, and it's not overly artistic (well...in parts maybe) but it's so funny!

After that event, a bunch of other bad things happen to him. He's just this incredibly confused, unemployed pothead and his entire life is changed just because he has the same name of a millionaire who's wife owes money all over town!

To start this movie takes a simple complication and just keeps on piling on complication after complication that eventually we would suspect the story would become very complicated and hard to follow, but in The Big Lebowski, the main characters don't seem to be affected by all these situations and complications, some would say this is bad story-telling, but the fact that the main characters acknowledge the difficulties and try to solve them as best they can, and being people who are just going where the wind takes them in life you would think that the whole story would end up the same way even if they weren't there but no it is the exact opposite. Anyway, onto my verdict of the story, coming from the minds of the Coen brothers they managed to create a dark, witty and hilarious story with twists and bumps causing the story to become so detailed yet with a real tone, not a film-real tone a real down to earth tone, i still can't comprehend how they managed to do it. This story will keep you entertained and thinking for weeks, therefore the story gets a pass from me. Onto direction, i thoroughly enjoy the Coen brothers style and in The Big Lebowski it really worked, giving us the exact angle we needed, and entertaining us with beautiful shots with dialogue that will not soon be forgotten. There isn't much else to say other than i am really looking forward to the next Coen brothers film and you should too, so as my final rating i am giving The Big Lebowski a 9/10.",

It's a movie that I would watch multiple times because apart from the great plot it was also very funny and the music was well chosen. Jeff Bridges makes you believe that he really is ""The Dude"", and you start too sympathize with him even though he is a lazy unemployed man. When the film started with a voice-over of an old man i thought ""oh this is gonna be so long and boring"", but it wasn't until 5 minutes later that I totally changed my mind, and I was sucked into the story-line . I gave this film eight stars and I would definitely recommend it.",

I know that the Coen brothers set out to make a movie like no other and I feel like they have.  The movie didn't make me fall off my seat with laughter until I really thought about it for several days.  It took several viewings of the movie to catch everything that was going on.  I had to purchase a video so I could save money at the video store!  Each viewing revealed yet another detail that was missed previously.

699,26 December 2000,markguszak,10, One of the greatest comedies ever!,"Alright, so I am a Coen fanatic and that might make me biased. However, the Coens did make Hudsucker Proxy and I did not really like that. So, you can believe me when I say this is one of the greatest comedies ever. Right up there with Raising Arizona (that Coen brother thing again). To sum it up simply, the Dude has a rug that really ties the room together. It gets miterated upon by some guys looking for Bunny. But, Bunny is not the Dude's wife. Oh yeah, some Nihilists are also looking for Bunny. They believe in nothing. Walt is going to help Dude get his rug ( a new one) back and find several analogies to the Vietnam war to sum up what is going on. The Dude does get a rug, but it was Maude's rug, Bunny's stepdaughter, but don't call her that. Oh yeah, Maude will have Dude's baby after her assistants beat the Dude up. Even though the Dude would prefer getting together with Bunny (she was in Logjamming), but Brandt does a good job of preventing that. Oh yeah, the Nihilists cut the toe off one of their girlfriends, they pretend that it is Bunny's toe, so they can get ransom from the Big Lebowski, who is not the Dude. Donny sadly dies, the Little Lebowski urban achievers lose out on a million dollars, Dude gets the Credence back, but the car is totaled. Is this helping? Or should I stop?",

The greatest thing about this film is the characters that are created.  The Dude (Jeff Bridges) is one of the all-time great film creations. Walter (John Goodman), standing in stark contrast to the Dude's pacifism, is similarly brilliant. Steve Buscemi is funny in a minimalistic role as Donny, who is always one sentence behind everyone else. The Stranger (Sam Elliott) is a classic narrator, completely unrelated to the plot. Other unnecessary characters include the unnervingly funny Jesus (John Turturro) and the painfully awkward landlord Marty (one of the underappreciated moments in the film is his dance routine). Honestly, would the plot really be affected if the stranger, Donny, Jesus, Marty, Brandt, or Knox Harrington weren't in the film. What about the private detective at the end, or the fascist policeman. The plot need not be understood to enjoy the comedy gold of this film. I gave it the a ten on this website's ratings, and it is my personal favorite Coen brothers movie (right ahead of O Brother, Where Art Thou and Miller's Crossing).",

Of course, there is the basic 'story' line about a guy whose rug has been stolen by some nihilists who hold him for someone else having the same name, but to be honest that storyline only serves to piece together the incredibly funny scenes that make up this movie. Oh boy do I wish I had some of the laid-back-ness The Dude possesses. Bridges is your parents' nightmare, and lovable for that. Goodman and his never-ending flirtations with Jewish Religion and Vietnam are so utterly ridiculous without ever being offensive, hilarious! Then there is Donny, a marvel in his own right. The nihilists, Lebowski's daughter Maude and her vaginal art, her gayer than gay house friend Anton, The Jesus in his purple shiny training suit, The Dude's landlord / neighbour, the list is almost endless.

""Barton Fink"" and ""Millers Crossing"" showed an outstanding knack for serious comedy, if such a phrase can be used.  The unfortunate failure of ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" was followed by ""Fargo"", their most critical and commercially successful film to date.  When ""The Big Lebowski"" came out in 1998, it was met with some critical division and was not the commercial success many had envisioned it to be.  It is a shame, because ""The Big Lebowski"" is an outstanding comedy, filled with great characters and brilliant dialogue.  It is also technically superb, with meticulous attention paid to every detail.  Add in career-topping roles from Jeff Bridges and John Goodman and you have a movie that will be held in the same esteem as some of the greatest comedies ever.",
721,25 September 2018,ng-38562,10, The most memorable characters of any movie I've seen,"Whenever I try to explain The Big Lebowski to someone, I tell them that the film is 25% plot and 75% characters. While that is a cursory explanation and neglects setting as a rather large portion, I think it well portrays the priorities and attitude of the film.
 To be sure, the plot is still well crafted and exciting. It is an easily flowing story of misunderstanding, kidnapping, and deception. And it manages all three topics without a dark theme by telling it through the eyes of an unmotivated and nonchalant hippie. But the film is far more than just a plot.
 After watching it the first time, I realized that many of the scenes and dialogues could be completely omitted and the plot would still make sense. Walter bringing his wife's Pomeranian to the bowling game, as well as his constant reference to his service in the Vietnam war, and the scene where The Dude attends his landlord's dance recital, none of these contribute to the plot at all, but contribute much to character and setting development. And they are so effective that no one could really care about the extra length. They make the characters funny and memorable, and the film as such. 
 One example scene where The Dude first meets Maude, shows how the Coen brothers squeeze as much theme development as they can out of a scene. In this scene, Maude tells The Dude about Bunny and how the kidnapping is likely staged. They could have had The Dude respond to Maude's statements and conversation, as a normal scene would play out. But instead they have The Dude constantly interjecting to ask about his rug, while Maude ignores him and carries out a one-sided conversation. Doing so preserves the spacey, aloof nature of The Dude's personality, and showcases Maude's persistent and independent character, all while giving the scene a comedic mood.
 The film presses the contrasting characters of The Dude and Walter together constantly as well. Their differences - The Dude being an easy-going pacifist and Walter being an impulsive, sometimes aggressive War Vet - bring out the hilarity in both characters. They are constantly arguing, and The Dude often regrets everything that Walter brings him into (such as Walter's involvement in the hand off or Walter clubbing a stranger's sports car). But the relationship is relatable, and gives the movie a casual, familiar tone.
 Much of the hilarity also comes from how calmly The Dude handles all the events. He rarely loses his cool or questions anything. There seems to be little difference in how he handles being the courier for a ransom hand off or having his car windows smashed compared to buying cream from the grocery store. He lets viewers experience the cool and calm persona they have always wanted to be.
 The visual style of the movie is certainly memorable. Recalling it brings a specific set of colors to mind, those being a sort of orange to tan spectrum. This can be seen from The Dude's gown he always wears, to the wood, the seats, and the wall paneling of the bowling alley, to the tinted glasses always worn by Walter. This is also perpetuated by the lighting of many of the scenes, as it usually comes from warm sources like candles or sunlight when the actual surroundings are not orange in color.
 The film is a representation of a feeling or lifestyle, not merely a story. The characters live outside the movies and reside in the heads of viewers as they are some of the most memorable from a single movie in film history. It is no wonder the film has such a cult following.",

I was on the ground laughing because I could see that happening to someone. You had to learn to respect authority or suffer the consequences.

If you haven't seen this move...see it!  If you don't like it, than I am sorry, because I will always have this movie on my shelf, just waiting for a lazy day so that I can once again laugh.",
734,14 August 2006,glocksout,8, Contemporary Classic,"The Big Lebowski is one of those classic films everyone talks about that I've never seen, until recently. I'm glad I did. This superbly cast comedy features Jeff Bridges as ""The Dude"", the unemployed ""live and let live"" antagonist who is unfortunately thrust into a series of events beyond his control along with his two best friends, and bowling colleges, Walter and Donny, played by John Goodman and Steve Buscemi respectively. The comedic timing and skillful screenplay are amazing. Watching these three interact in scenes is beautiful. Of course there is more to this film than the comedy, and the mysterious twists and turns are strong on their own right, and the overall lesson learned is heartfelt. This really is a classic film brought to us by the Coen brothers.",

This movie is the absolute king of subtle comedy, you'd have to watch it a few times to understand what I am talking about.

Thats what it should all be about.",
736,3 July 2008,from_christmas_past,8, Mark that as an eight.,"It is a director's movie and again, the Coen brothers manage to leave their idiosyncratic stamp on this movie. Mostly intriguing, but sometimes weird, the Coens allow another story to unravel in a psuedorealistic world that they create in so many of their movies. Looking back at this movies as a whole, it seems like a rather mediocre product with crumbling storyline. However, if you have watched the Coens enough, you would know that they are more likely to deliver instantaneous gratification while watching a movie than give memorable product to be remembered later. So, while some subplots in the Big Lebowski stick out like a sore thumb, the movie succeeds in entertaining with some genuinely hilarious scenes. There are moments where sheer brilliance radiates from the scene construction and it is for these moments the movie has to be watched. In my early days as a Coens fan, I have made the mistake of trying to overthink their movies. It is mistake because retrospectively their movies may appear ordinary, but at the time of viewing, the Coens amazing audaciousness holds together. It may be viewed as a victory of style over substance, but it really is an effort to choose entertainment over reality. I did not take much home from Lebowski, neither did I think it was a perfect storyline, but it was thoroughly entertaining. And sometimes, that is all you need.",

All you have to do is take a stupid plot and mix it with some dead beat characters that yell a whole lot.  This movie should not be on the top 250 list, nor anywhere close.  You have to think when you finish watching this movie ""Why is this a great film?  What did I learn from this?"" then you will understand.  I laughed maybe twice during the whole movie.  John Goodman's character's lack of not being able to see the scale of problems is not funny at all, more irritating than anything else.  It's hard to sit through 2 hours of listening to him spit out the ""genius comedy"" lines that people on here keep raving about.  These lines are not more that phrases that literally don't make any sense and the only reason people will think they are funny or repeat them because they have no place in any movie.  For instance, what is ""the bar eats you"" line?  Now some of you can overanalyze this into making some sense but I am sure that it was written to be just another stupid line that was said with hopes of being overanalyzed into something that made sense.

Critics of the Coens say their movies have no sensitivity, and that their ""imaginativeness"" is only a recycling of old themes. I say that I don't agree one hundred percent with their police work there. What they do is pay homage to classic memories of films while working them into the strange universe that has been titled ""Coen County"". ""The Big Lebowski"" continues with what has made them so entertaining. Bizarre characters, encounters, and dialogue occur during His Dudeness' journey in the City of Angels. Don't expect majestic truths to be revealed, heart-rending melodrama, or fireballs. Just loads of laughs for anyone who appreciates intelligent and abstract humor. My only question is: Who is The Stranger supposed to be? Is he The Dude's guardian angel, his long-lost father, or another member of the Seattle Seven?",

The truth is that, somehow, it's all of that--and a bag of chips.  More or less, it's about bowling, mistaken identity, and a soiled rug.  Jeff Bridges is so mellow, so cool as The Dude, and Julianne Moore, everybody's favorite indie darling (let's just forget ""The Lost World""), is perfect as the mind-bogglingly bizarre Maude.  Look for appearances by all the usual suspects (John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro) as well as a few new friends.

It was perfectly written, amazingly acted, wonderfully directed, there wasn't a single thing wrong with the film. If you ever talk to a person who did not enjoy this film, it's because it was too far above them. There are plenty of jokes for everyone. And then there are the perfectly added ""inside jokes"" as well. Such as the several references to ""Branded"" an old TV show. A show the characters in the film loved. They talked of it lasting hundreds of episodes, when in fact, there were only a handful of episodes. There were jokes about every day life. Jokes about the simple fact that the Dude is a dinosaur. Every other ""radical"" or ""hippie"" grew up, got jobs, and stopped with the drugs. The Dude on the other hand, is still living in the 60s. And if you look at his friends they all have their own little stories, and show how deeply their pasts affect them. However, they show this great characterization through jokes. Something very hard to do. For example Walter(Goodman)obviously hit his peak and the height of his life, back in Vietnam and when he was married. So, the jokes about him are Walter spazzing at people ""I AM A UNITED STATES VETERAN!"" And that's how we get to know him. How unique is that? The same thing can be said of Donnie(Buscemi) here is an ex-surfer who obviously did drugs, and they took his mind, you know this from his sheer absent mindedness. It's truly a unique film, of which we shall never see the like again, and for that I'm sorry. It's the Coen brothers at top form.",

But who cares this the most funny and easy going film I have ever seen, no matter what is the stakes are we all will get along easily at the end, that's the fun part. There is a wider mystery and subplots lingering around the movie throughout but that's the small part of this big universe. We can all create our own backstories about Jesus, Donny , Walter, Mr Lebowski, Maude, and Philip Seymour Hoffman riotusly funny sort of butler. The thing is we can piece the puzzle ourselves but should we do that? Why mess up the fun just seat back and enjoy the film right this is the most slice of lifest of slice of life films I have ever seen. And this is the best stoner comedy film ever. Roger deakins cinematography really brings the relaxed attitude of the film. And Steve buscemi and John Goodman's acting is first rate. Goodman's Vietnam veteran character is superbly funny is jives at the then government of America and it's politics are very funny to hear but equally tragic and true. Steve buscemi is playing a dufous character who doesn't know anything what is going on is also very funny his role is somewhat of a plot point but still he carries the role in an masterfull way. Especially his demise was sad even you know he is not the central figure of the film but still you care, that's great acting. And dude the eponymous dude, the dudeness of all dudeness Jeff brigdes shines like a pot he is smoking and flying around the sky, this is the most phenomenal eventfull performance I have ever seen cause this character is still stuck in the upper echelons of pop culture and all thanks to Jeff brigdes.

794,3 September 2002,hartig,10, Sheer comedic brilliance.,"The Brothers Coen might be the only filmmakers in the world who could put out a comedy caper about a middle-aged unemployed stoner, his war-obsessed best friend, a paraplegic millionaire, his feminist sister, soiled rugs, an eccentric pornographer, a gang of 3 German nihilists late of a techno-rock band, and a trophy wife moonlighting as a porn actress and actually make it work.",

At times it was hilarious.  The dream sequences were excellent.  What ruined the movie overall for me was the extremely excessive use of the F word and the stuttering and repetition of Jeff Bridges' dialogue.

This rich, multi-layered comedy just seems to get better with each additional viewing--perhaps because no matter how hard you puzzle over the film, you'll never quite be able to understand everything about it at once.  I equate The Big Lebowski to 12 Monkeys in that regard--both films are wildly entertaining on the surface, slightly ominous underneath, and have moments of pure genius throughout.",

Problem was I didnt know what to make of the film, was it serious or a comedy? It was too stupid to be serious, and it wasnt funny enough to be a comedy. We had an unemployed bum who drank white Russians all day get caught up in a plot, this was so silly and unbelievable that I was soon bored,hoped it would get better but it didnt. If it had a good storyline or was funny I would have liked it,but it was neither. How people said this was a great film is beyond me.",

I feel that it takes a lot from a movie to make me leave with a sense of satiation, but this movie does it for me. Wonderfully written and directed by the Coen brothers, it is yet another masterpiece from them. Another thing is, that this movie never tries to be funny. It doesn't have random quirky characters or punch lines, it all comes from the scenes, very naturally. 10 out of 10. And how cool is the scene when the sheriff throws and hits The Dude in the forehead with the mug, and the mug doesn't turn while it's in the air! So many great scenes.",

The story, actors and the dialogue provide for a fun two hours. The story itself is not important, but it`s oddball cast of characters that makes the movie so funny and charming. Jeff Bridges gives one of his best performances of his career as The Dude, his extremely lazy lifestyle makes you laugh. John Goodman is good as The Dude`s best friend Walter, who is a Vietnam veteran, Steve Buscemi as the quiet but loveable Donny, John Torturro as the eccentric bowler Jesus, Peter Stormare as the former porn star and nihilist and Julianne Moore as Maude. Philip Seymour Hoffman and the rest of the cast also do a great job.",

The first time I watched this movie I was laughing so hard my stomach ached for a couple of days. And it only got better on the second viewing since not being an American I missed many of the jokes the first time around. The acting is superb by everybody  from Jeff Bridges who is 100% authentic as the Dude to Flea who cameos as a misfit would-be kidnapper. The story is wonderfully original. The cinematographic work is great ( how about those nutty dream scenes?!). I will not spend time describing the plot as  many others have done this already but I'll say this: If like me you  have trouble facing adversity in your life, take the lead from the ultimate walrus - the Dude and take it easy. And if you can't, the Dude will do it for you. ""I don't know about you but I take comfort in that. It's good knowin' he's out there. The Dude. Takin' 'er easy for all us sinners."" Peace, \/.",

He will have you rolling in the aisles as they say. Go get yourself some jellies, a man cardigan and a ""caucasian"" and enjoy this delectable offering from the Coen brothers.

A few strange characters in a strange story about a bogus kidnipping or bowling match? The theme goes back and forth to nowhere. Not sure there was a script or entire movie done ablib or impromptu.

I find myself chuckling to myself and when my wife asks why, I will quote a part of the film, laugh some more and then she threatens to leave me!! The film is clever on so many levels. First of all it picks a time in history where very few movies back track to, it pick a subject matter that very few films pick ( bowling, porn movies, nihilists etc etc). Great performances, Jon Goodman especially was just made for the role. Above all the script for this film is so tight that you can watch this film time after time and not get tired of it and Goodmans speech on the cliff to the dead Donny is one of the greatest bits of film ever.",

I smoke marijuana regularly and enjoy some stoner films, but damn this was just boring. I also like bowling and I'm Jewish so I really thought it would resonate. But maybe too much time has passed and that style of comedy is no longer humorous unless it's pressing your nostalgia buttons. Glad I watched after many years but I didn't miss anything.",

I love this movie one of the best comedy of all time for sure.no matter how many times I've seen this movie, it's always interesting to watch it again and it's always as funny as watching it for the first time. The Big Lebowski received mixed reviews at the time of its release. Over time, reviews have become largely positive, and the film has become a cult favorite,noted for its eccentric characters, comedic dream sequences, idiosyncratic dialogue, and eclectic soundtrack. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". A spin-off, titled The Jesus Rolls, was released in 2020, with Turturro reprising his role and also serving as writer and director.",

The eccentric Dude and his bowling buddies and their antics are so hilarious I laughed for days after seeing this.  I had to replay several scenes over and  over in disbelief of how creative and funny they were.  The acid flashbacks were particularly great!  John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro are in perfect form!",
824,1 August 2020,stalhusseini,8, The essence of a simple story told well,"Simplicity: There's nothing ground breaking in the story. In actuality it's really quite simple. The real enjoyment in this movie is how well the story is told.
Characters: Everything down to the eccentricity of the characters (and the script) is what keeps you engaged at all times. It's not if Bonnie was kidnapped, who kidnapped her and who has the money. It's actually more about each character and the interactions drawn from the variance of each of their personalities that light up the movie. From Jeff Lebowski and his facade of wealth and collectiveness, Maude and her band of odd friends, Walter and his flash-back Nam infused angry interactions, the nihilists and their strange ferret intimidation techniques to Donny and his pitied like-ability.
Unpredictability: You can never really tell what's going to happen from one scene to the next, it's far from predictable. The story takes a series of turns with the viewer never really guessing what or who is going to pop up next - that for me, is probably what differentiates the exceptional directors from the good.
Script: It's those little touches such as how The Dude recites what he hears and picks up around him and uses it in latter interactions with the other characters; that level of detail is what separates it from other movies. The conversations are fun and the dialogue among characters interesting.",
825,5 September 2008,Ross16,8, Jeff bridges at his best,"Jeff bridges at his best ever, i think, it is so funny this man the dude should be everyone's hero. the movie is also about peace in his own intrinsically and curiously unusual way. Looking at it after now 10 years after it was made is not only still a great laugh, but also inspiring. It's good now and then to get back in to rock and roll. I think the movie tackles important questions about life, in an intensely comical and intelligent way. I live in Europe and it might just be that people who are not so familiar with the American culture would not be able to catch the great humor, but I feel blessed to be able to understand the hero that the dude is playing. i truly wish i was like him. Detailed in every scene, rich characterization, diverse soundtrack, witty real life dialogue. This movie is God.

This professor gave us the example of when he was in graduate school he and his wife joined a bowling league in their town. He said that it was a great way to meet new people whom you may have never otherwise thought of spending time with. He said that our society needed to relearn those social skills.

One night, I rented this movie (seeing it for the second time), I laughed my fool head off, and things got better again.  Perhaps The Dude's final line in the movie (which I won't give away) provided me with hope and perspective. This is one of those rare comedies that just keeps getting funnier every time you see it.  Jeff Bridges, who is so good at intense, brooding roles, has unbelievable comic timing here. Some criticize the plot as overly meandering, and it is.  But the film's aura is compelling, and you just want to go along for the ride.",

It also doesn't hurt to use some of the best (and most under rated) actors in Hollywood. Jeff Bridges plays the slacker, ""The Dude"" Jeff Lebowski to a tee.  He does not stray away from his character.  His chemistry with Goodman's orthodox militant Walter is choreographed flawlessly. This movie is as trippy as the Dude and leaves you rolling for more.",

The layers in this film are staggering, and I don't think it's hyperbole to say this is the greatest film ever made. If you have seen this film once, and you hated it, I encourage you to watch it two more times. I was hooked from the opening credits, but my wife did not like it. But, she likes me, so she did not balk when I wanted to continue my habit of repeated viewings. After about the third time, she was quoting lines and pointing out some of the motif's.

It will leave you two options , whether you will like it or you will hate it. The characterzation are so brilliantly made by coen brothers and executed with perfect casting. Jeff bridges as ""the dude"" -jeff lebowski had completely nailed his role. And john Goodman as Walter done his supporting role wonderfully and its worthy of notice.

Yeah, a little... it shows a lot of acid humor and sarcasm , which by the way I love....Otherwise, the movie lacks of consistency. or let me say, a spinal cord...it has great specific moments of excellence....although is not enough for pasting all of them into a unique brightness piece..... The storyline in general is poor...in my opinion.....sometimes I felt as if the movie has just stopped..... Look Burn after reading for instance.....it's the most great movie of Coen brothers.....I loved it!!! The main characters are great in The big Lebowski despite of their just passable interaction ....highlighting Jesus, who was by far my favorite character...appealing, flashy, arrogant and clueless at the same time... On the background I've enjoyed the subject, specially the greed, which is continuously at our side all the time.... live, and see how petty and greedy people are....

It has the most amazing characters, you can pick your favorite sure, but non of them sucks, and they are all played brilliantly. It has the most amazing dialogs, everything that is said in this movie is just so brilliant, if you don't agree, then, that's just, like, your opinion, man. It has the most amazing story, it's both strange and interesting, and the way it's told keeps your eyes on the screen the whole time. I've probably seen this movie about 20 times now, and I enjoy it every time, every god damn time it's brilliant and mind-blowing and funny, and enjoyable and etc. So I ask again, why is it not the best movie ever made? why, the hell, is The big Lebowsky, not the best, movie, ever, made?",

There are about (total) 20 slow minutes in the movie, and the rest of it is absolutely hilarious.  John Goodman's performance as Walter is Oscar material, and definitely my favorite character of any movie I've ever seen, from giving his choice words to Donny to relating just about everything that happens to Vietnam.  The conversations at the bowling alley are classics.

The film combines the best of slapstick, hilarious dialogue, extremely well-drawn and complex characters, an excellent plot, and social commentary of the highest calibur to create perhaps the best comedy of all time. Jeff Bridges is absolutely brilliantly lazy in his quasi-passive burnt-out character, while John Goodman provides perhaps one of the most impressive performances as a shafted disgruntled reactionary ""'Nam"" veteran. John Turturro provides the most immediately up-front hilarious character as a bowling 'paedharass', Jesus Quintana: ""That's right, Nobody f***s with the Jesus!""

This is easily the funniest and most quotable movie I've ever seen and it is still wonderfully entertaining after many, many viewings. The cast is perfect - Jeff Bridges and John Goodman arguably gave the performances of their careers to date in this movie. The only reason I could see why people could have problems with this fine work is the language, which does not exactly adhere to the commonly accepted concept of good manners. If you don't mind that, this movie is a definite must see.

872,7 August 2002,saultonofswing,10," The Best Comedy Ever Made and one which I could watch forever, dude!","This movie is the reason why movies are made.  It is fun, funny and yet carries a message with it of dire consequences for ones actions.  Though set in the time of operation desert storm, the jokes, punchlines, anecdotes and characters are not dated one bit, and neither are the reacurring references of politics, lingo and expresssions like ""chinaman"", ""nialist"", ""johnson"" or ""dude"".  I never thought the word dude could be personified into so many different verbs, adjectives or nouns, that a simple story involving a kidnapping mixed with bowling could be so complex with so many different characters yet be so intricately structured that it is still simple to comprehend, with every character uniquely created while still commanding multiple viewings.  The character of the Dude, based on a friend of the Cohen brothers, is expertly played by Jeff Bridges as a simple stoner who loves White Russians, bowling and is overwhelmed by all the attention suddenly paid to his quiet existence by a chance of mistaken identity. His friends are the hilarious John Goodman playing a divorced converted Jew who frequently references ""'Nam"" in inappropriate instances, repeatedly asks ""Am I wrong?"" in an attempt to justify his actions and still acts like a soldier past him prime, pulling guns and uzis out to keep the world sane.  Steve Buschemi, John Tutturo and Philip Seymour Hoffman both offer hilarious quips, questions, quotations and funny accents to add to the insanity. Add in Julian Moore and Tara Reid in early yet believable performances and a masterpiece is formed.  Every piece of dialogue is a quotable quote, every scene is expertly woven, every character is well structured and every joke is fully explored.  Theres no dumb pot humour here, only intelligent jokes with some of the best physical abuse comedy ever set to the music of Creedence Clearwater, Bob Dylan's 'The Man in Me', Kenny Roger's 'What Condition my Condition was in' and the Eagles 'Hotel California' in Spanish. This is not only the best bowling movie ever made, the best Cohen brother movie ever made, and the best comedy ever made, it is also one of the best if not the best movie ever made and it only gets better every time you watch it.  The phrase may be cliched but this movie is the one that made it so. And if you see one movie for the rest of your life, make it this one. 11/10",

These brothers seem to be masters at the medium of film. Every single line of dialogue in this movie has a way of being seen as funny, even if you can find a line in the film that isn't very obviously comedic. The film is genius in the way that through all it's seeming simplicity, through all that it seems to focus on the ridiculous plight of a stoner attempting to solve a mystery, it harbors a deep philosophy, a sort of live and let live philosophy. In other words, the Dude Abides. The three main performances, those of John Goodman, Jeff Bridges, and Steve Buscemi, are expertly played, as are the majority of the roles, including Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, and John Turturro. Also, the music in the film, as some people have pointed out, is much like a character in the film. And it just 'fits right in there' to quote the Stranger. The movie is fantastically rewatchable.

881,15 March 2017,iollann,9, Great film 'The Big Lebowski',"Review: 'The Big Lebowski' 'The Big Lebowski' by the Coen brothers is a great film because of its great characters. The cast includes Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, John Turturro and many more. 'The Big Lebowski' released in 1998 is a quirky crime comedy about an unemployed slacker from L.A who is drawn into a world of kidnapping after being mistaken for a washed up millionaire of the same name. To summarize it 'The Big Lebowski' is about 'The Dude' a slacker and a keen bowler, when two enforcers show up at his house demanding money, having mistook him for a millionaire with the same name and urinating on his carpet, he is plunged into a world of deceit, kidnapping and much more in the pursuit to be compensated for his ruined carpet. A summary of the plot does not do this film justice. The character of 'The Dude' is brought to life by the outstanding performance of Jeff Bridges. The dude has so many hilarious quotes and back and forths with his counterpart 'Walter' played by John Goodman. Jeff Bridges seamlessly plays 'The Dude' with laid back perfection. I was disappointed though with Steve Buscemi's character 'Donny' having very few lines in the film although whenever he does talk he is usually told to shut up which can be quite funny. Another film by the Coen brothers called 'Fargo' has Steve Buscemi in a much bigger role than in this one and he is excellent in 'Fargo'. I would have preferred if he was given a bigger role like in 'Fargo'. John Turturro has a hilarious performance as 'Jesus' but little screen time. During the film's spectacular dream sequences are used with great effect. The soundtrack for the film is very good too. In conclusion 'The Big Lebowski' is more about the characters than the plot. I would recommend this film too everyone and I would give it a 9/10. It is my favourite Coen brothers' film and my favourite film with Jeff Bridges in it that I have seen.",
882,8 September 2008,Shannon38,9, A celebration of the ultimate man,"It's easily better than Fargo, IMHO, and it's right up there with Barton Fink or Miller's Crossing. A true comedy classic with so many memorable lines and characters, but it's the movie's atmosphere which is so truly joyous, a wonderful celebration of basically doing nothing. Achieving one's goals is important, yes, but it's okay to set them low, is what I perceived this movie to be saying. As long as one is basically a good guy, then that's enough. Well, that's what it seemed like to me, and it was expressed so beautifully in the stunning cast of grotesques, lovely music ( although more Burwell would have been nice ), and the trippiest, funniest, most absurd dream sequences you've ever seen. If you're a type A personality, you might not like this movie much, but for the type B's, and further on down the alphabet, (the further the better) Great Movie!",

Even if Buscemi does not say that much he gives his part a memorable performance.All the other actors who have small parts are hilarious. Take Turturro for example who plays a latino bowling player named Jesus with such perfect acting so I canÂ´t help laughing.So if youÂ´re looking for a very twisted and well played comedy this is the one to see. This picture will make you feel really good.DonÂ´t miss the burial scene.",

The dialogue, although filled with the F word, sounded genuine, coming from real people in real situations. The acting seemed so natural that it was on par with movies like the Godfather. I can watch the movie several times and see something new simply because of the acting. There is no one who can play the dude better than Jeff Bridges. The role was made for him. ",

Now, just the thought of watching it makes me laugh.  I am laughing while I am putting it in the DVD player, and I am laughing now as I think about Jeff Bridges playing detective all of a sudden and finding a cartoon picture of a man with an enormous penis on the pad that Jackie Treehorn had scribbled on.  I mean come on, is this not cinematic genius?  Whatever the reasons, this film just gets better the more times you see it; similar in that regard to ""Office Space.""

I knew the makers by their previous works but was not yet a fan. The first time I saw it I didn't understand what was going on. The second time I watched it I knew the plot and could therefore concentrate on the subtleties. That is what makes this film greatness. The Big Lebowski is a shining example of what film should be, a perfect marriage of superior quality writing and heart-felt acting from the masters of their respective professions, with an attention to detail unlike any other. Materials of the finest quality mature with age and stand the test of time. This film never gets old and only improves with each sequential viewing the way summer block-busters never can.

The casting is superb: Jeff Bridges down-at-heels bum is in perfect contrast to John Goodman's up-tight Vietnam veteran with Steve Buscemi perfectly in between. The constellation colourful and entertaining characters is another feature of the film: the Dude's wierd landlord (into strange amateur dance routines), the militant feminist played by Juliana Moore, the sycophantic personal assistant played by whatshisname Hoffman (played George in Scent of a woman, the gang of nihilists, the porn king, the bimbo kidnapee and - topping them all - the sexually perverted bowler player called (blasphemically) Jesus.

928,6 April 1999,Duderino-2,10, A masterpiece,"Some critics didn't like this movie, accusing it of ""being inconsistent"", of ""having no plot"" and of ""talking about nothing"". I think they are the sort of people that praised pathetic, boring movies like The Thin Red Line or Spielberg's latest epic. Lebowski is the best Coen movie ever. In a plot that is essentially a bizarre version of The Big Sleep, the Coens throw in some amazing characters like the L.A. slacker ""Dude"", the half-crazy Vietnam veteran, the Dude's pathetic landlord, Jesus, the ""Nihilists"" and the result is absolutely brilliant. The heroes (or should I say idiots) of the movie have the unique ability to screw up everything they are trying to do, from a simple investigation to the shaking of Donny's ashes in the end. The surreal dream sequences demonstrate the Coen brothers' virtuosity. I laughed from the beginning to the end of the movie. Lebowski is one of the funniest and most original movies of the decade. Ten out of ten.",

932,18 October 1999,nick69,10, Cohen Brothers,The more I watch this movie the more I enjoy it.  That is a statement that can be made for almost all of the Cohen brother's films.  John Goodman gives his best performance ever.  The over the top performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman was right on and overlooked.  This guy always steals the scene no matter what movie he's in.  (Except Twister which no one could have saved.) When I first heard Jeff Bridges was doing a Cohen brothers film I was kind of surprised but he did a good and convincing job as the Dude.  A give this film a 9.  By the way I got in an argument with my friend over the Cohens. Here is how I rank their films.,
933,11 June 2001,STEVEN_SEAL,8, damn funny film!!!,What can i say about this film. ive recently watched it on video. ive watched fargo and that was the main reason why i purchased this movie. i thought the coen brothers have a gift and wondered if this same gift is used in this movie. in my opinion this is probably better than fargo. steve buscemi and john goodman are absolutely hilarious in this movie. especialy when donnie says one word in a conversation with a quick reply of 'shut the f##k up donnie' from goodman. but lets not take any thing away from jeff bridges who as the 'dude' is so good at being so chilled makes me laugh. the dream sequences made me crack up as well with jeff or the 'dude' doing his little dance down those huge steps. all in all a pleasure to watch one of my top 10 movies. 'well at least im house broken',
934,17 February 2011,RhodyDave,9, Fantastic Performances,"Man, do I love this movie. I've seen it a few times, and it gets better with each viewing.

Jeff Bridges will always be ""The Dude"".",
935,14 April 2002,Ad _dude,10, The Dude abides.,"What can I say? This is one of my favourite films to date. The Coen brothers have done it again; have they ever made a bad film? Well Barton fink was odd but still not bad. Jeff Bridges is The Dude, literally. I find it very strange that the hero of this story is a loafer who just wants to drink White Russians, get stoned, and bowl, but it works a treat. I found myself getting caught up in their world. John goodman played a great role as The Dude's friend Walter and Steve Buscemi filled the part of poor old Donny. The story is humorous throughout although brief sadness is found, but even this is used to humorous effect. Okay it isn't one of the most intricately woven plots ever but the dialogue is expertly written and the characters superb. I recommend this film to anyone who is a Coen brother's fan (that really goes without saying) and anyone who sees a bit of The Dude in themselves (which, if we were honest might be a lot of us) oh, and anyone who likes cool movies.",

The Big Lebowski was the answer. The Coen brothers are in a league of their own when it comes to quality control. Everything about this film oozes class, and style, from the opening title sequences, surreal dreams(flashbacks!) and some imaginitive camera work. Good use of colour as well, check out  the bowling balls and the 'Jesus's suit. It's also very, very funny, and the whole of the cast are at their best!",

The film follows the story of a disillusioned Eagles obsessive by the name of Jeff Bridges who's tubwaggled into a world of stolen cars, blown toe-nails, and marmots. Once satisfied to idolize Richard Nixon to the tune of an all Eagles soundtrack the Dude finds himself tugged crotch first into a world of international intrigue. Supporting roles includes a militant Rosie O'Donnel as The Dude's brother in law and shooting partner Walter and Steve Buscemi as Creedence fan John Turturro. In short this film is perfect for anyone who harbors a love for The Eagles, Bowling, and White Russians. Take er' easy dude!",

""THE BUMS WILL ALWAYS LOSE!"" ""HAVE YOU EVER HEARD|OF Vietnam?"" ""YOU'RE ENTERING|A WORLD OF PAIN, SON."" and many others . It's as to describe a landscape colored with millions of colors , a way to walk in an alien heaven , it's how life should be but the potential is it's how life ""might be"" . Kind of humans with their low vision of this world would not spend a cent as they wouldn't break their ordinary world of fear , fear watching a person who does change own world without pretending to change anything , an anonymous sequence of d.n.a. binary in a world ever biggest than the day before , and Dude swims in this anonymous world , escaping from sharks , humans which lost from their born that free state primitive painted by J.J.Rousseau in Emile .

Personnally I find nothing amusing about slapstick comedy, the beauty of Lebowski(and all genuinly funny films, Dr Strangelove, Withnail and I, Annie Hall)is that it uses well crafted characters, intelligence and/or stupidity for reaching the child within. Lines such as ""she's gotta feed the monkey"" are just so off the wall that it never fails raise giggles, smirks and riotous rolling on the floor. The Dude and Walter are one of the best double acts I've ever witnessed, up there with Lemon and Curtis in Some like it Hot or Laural and Hardy. While critics are afraid to praise new films and rank them with the so called classics, I believe the Coen's will be remembered for this as well as Fargo, the same way that Orson Welles is remembered for Citizen Kane AND THEN Touch of Evil.

The best thing about the story itself is its simplicity (for the lack of a better word).  This movie does not try to teach us, or get a point across, it is just about dude's life who enjoys doing nothing.  Now the Coens took dude's life and turned it to one of the funniest, wittiest and most amusing movie of all times.  The soundtrack complements the story very well (the Coens always seem to have the perfect touch for their soundtrack choice) and Sam Elliot's voice for the narration was the perfect choice.
