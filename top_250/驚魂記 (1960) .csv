It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:",/

2,25 October 2006,ccthemovieman-1,10," The More I See This, The Better It Gets","When I watched this for the first time in over 30 years, I was surprised how little action there was since I had remembered this as some intense horror movie. Of course, I was young and more impressionable so I guess I just remembered those few dramatic, sensational scenes such as Janet Leigh murdered in the shower and the quick other murder at the top of the stairs. Basically, that was about it, action-wise, BUT I have no complaints because the more I watch this film, the more I like it. It has become my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie, along with Rear Window.",e
3,10 August 2004,slokes,10, Movie At The Crossroads Of Time,"What can you say about a film that's been talked about to death? Just this: If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to do so, not because it's a way of paying homage to the one true master of modern film, but because it's so fun to watch.",v
4,19 May 2017,arichmondfwc,10, Anthony's Norman,"Getting into Hitchcock's Psycho, 57 years after its original release is like assisting to a masterclass of sorts. We can now identify what made this little lurid tale into a classic. Hitchcock himself, naturally, but now we know the first director's cut was a major disappointment and that Alma Reville - Hitch's wife - took over, re edited and the results have been praised, applauded and studied ever since. Janet Leigh's Marion Crane created a movie landmark with her shower scene. Bernard Herrmann and his strings created an extra character that we recognize as soon as it reappears under any disguise but, what shook me the most now in 2017 is Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. His performance has evolved with the passing of time and its effect has remain as chilling, as moving, as funny and as real as it was in 1960. It's interesting to watch Gus Van Sant's 1998 version with Vince Vaugh as Norman Bates. If you look at the film, shot by shot with Berrnard Herrmann's strings - it's pretty fantastic. - Play it in black and white if you can. The problem and it is a monumental problem, we wait for Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, if the casting of Anne Heche was really bad - not a hint of Janet Leigh's humanity, the casting of Vince Vaughn was incomprehensible. Not just not credible for a moment but annoying, very annoying. Anthony Perkins brought something profoundly personal to Norman Bates and as a consequence we connected with his sickness. We felt for him. Okay, sorry, I didn't mean to go there but I felt compelled to because I saw again Psycho (1960) ad Psycho (1998) at 24 hours from each other and realized that the main flaw of the 1998 versions is the absence of Anthony Perkins.",i
5,9 December 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10," A film that you see once, and never forget...","I am a huge fan of Hitchcock, and have really liked all of the movies of his I have seen so far. My top 5 favourites are Vertigo, North By Northwest, Rear Window, Rebecca and this masterpiece. Before I saw this, I considered Vertigo as his masterpiece. After seeing this movie, I think Psycho outshines Vertigo.",e
6,23 November 2007,littlemartinarocena,10, Hitchcock and Herrmann,"Robert Bloch wrote the original work, Joseph Stefano adapted it into a tight screenplay but it was Alfred Hitchcock with the extraordinary complicity of Bernard Herrmann who transformed this lurid tale into a classic, horror masterpiece. The score propels us into the moment before the moment arrives provoking the sort of anticipation that verges on the unbearable. The fact that the key scenes have become iconic film moments: copied, imitated, emulated and parodied, have not diminished its impact, not really. The anticipation, underlined by Herrmann's strings, creates a sort of craving for the moment to arrive. That doesn't happen very often. No amount of planning can produce it or re-produce it - otherwise how do you explain the Gus Van Sant version - so, the only possible explanation is an accident, a miraculous film accident and those do happen. Everything falls into place so perfectly that even the things that one may argue are below the smart standard of the film, are needed, the film without every frame is not quite the film. Try to turn away after the climax during Simon Oakland's long explanation. You can't. I couldn't. Partly because you know you'll soon be confronting those eyes, that fly, the car...",w
7,16 November 2002,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, One of the greatest horror/suspense films ever!,"Alfred Hitchock is the master of suspense and Psycho is probably his most famous film. Because, let's face it, one way or another, you have seen or heard of this film. It's been made fun of, been remade(unfortunately), not to mention that this movie's word will be spred from generation to generation. I came across it very young, my parents used to tell me how scary it was and how I wouldn't want to take a shower after watching this film. I didn't believe them, but when I watched it, I for the first time pulled the blanket over my head, it was that frightening! The thing that is so amazing about Psycho is how much of an impact it made, and understandably why it did. It ranked in over 60 million dollars at the box office, now this was the time where tickets were like 50 cents at the theater, now if you compare that to today, that's Titanic like money! It broke many taboo's, like this was the first film to show a toilet being flushed, isn't that interesting? My high school teacher said that her and her mom saw Psycho when it was first released in theaters and she actually ran out of the theater terrified! Alfred did so well keeping us glued to our seats with all his great twists! This was before The Sixth Sense, I mean, the ending is just such a mind blower! But I won't give spoilers.",/

9,28 July 2014,Leofwine_draca,10, Hitch's masterwork,"PSYCHO truly is an excellent film, a movie which, along with the same year's PEEPING TOM, managed to kick start a new genre of psychological thrillers which continues to this day. It's perfectly made, with an excellent story (thanks to the reliable schlockmeister Robert Bloch), a great script adaptation, and assured direction from Hitchcock.",w
10,5 October 2001,Hitchcoc,10, Tight and Terrifying,"When Hitchcock tells a tale, he engages the mind of the audience. We don't need to see knives tearing into flesh, people being strangled on the screen, or gunshots ripping through a brain. And still, when we are finished, we are more uncomfortable than had we watched the actual murder. In Psycho, it's all about vulnerability. Janet Leigh is in a state of great agitation and needs to trust someone. Unfortunately it is the master taxidermist, Anthony Perkins. His Norman Bates, with his nervous tics, his analytical surmises, his understatement, are master-pieces of madness. This film is what every student should see. It is montage; it is tautness; it is the best kind of storytelling. ",2
11,25 November 2000,llihilloh,10, This is what good movies are all about.,This is one of the best movies ever created and Alfred Hitchcock is one of the most intriguing film makers ever to live. (in my opinion) There's just so much to say about this film I hardly know where to start.,9
12,12 September 2000,darkjosh,9, Perkins Is Remarkable,"Most modern-day horror films make the killer to be an absolutely inhuman, grotesque, unimaginable monster in order to scare the audience out of its wits.  Most of the time, however, these stereotypes create a generic murderer a raving, ranting, clearly demented psychopath.  One of the few memorable cinematic killers that does not adhere to these restraints and cliches is, of course, Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, whom manages to effectively cause the audience to recoil without such drek as the aforementioned devices.",6
13,19 January 2000,Chris-332,10, Hitchcock did it all in this one.,"When Psycho came out, the horror industry of movies was merely monsters, zombies, werewolves, and vampires. So when Psycho hit screens, the audience was finally introduced to psychological thrillers. It hit with such a huge bang that the audience was shocked...with fear and suspense. Psycho created what the thriller genre is today. It sliced through clique monster movies and changed it forever. Still today when you look at Norman Bates and his extremely freaky look when you see him watching the inspector's car sinking into the swamp sends chills down my spine. And when Marion Crane met her bloody demise in the middle of the movie, Hitchcock proved to everyone that this movie is different, different from every other movie you have ever seen. The cinematography in this movie is fabulous, the music is marvelously freaky, the acting is magnificent, the story is exceptional, and everything else about the movie is great. Too bad the sequels and the new remake was complete trash.",7
14,1 October 1999,Whizzer-2,10, Perkins Irreplaceable?,"Hitchcock was very fortunate to have cast the young Anthony Perkins in the leading role.  At the time there were some other young aspiring actors who might have qualified for the part, namely:  Michael J. Pollard; Jack Nicholson; Bruce Dern, Dean Stockwell, Victor Buono and Dennis Hopper.  However, it's hard for me to imagine anyone other than Perkins playing Norman Bates with complete authenticity, it's seems the role was simply made for him and only him.  Could you possibly imagine anyone other than Nicholson in the role of Randall P. McMurphy in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" or Dennis Hopper as Billy in ""Easy Rider""?  Keep in mind the introverted, insecure Mama's Boy was not really PSYCHOpathic as Hannibal The Cannibal was in ""Silence of the Lambs"" - a cold-blooded killer with no conscience - but rather criminally insane, plagued by schizophrenic delusions and seriously in need of multiple reality-checks.  Anthony Hopkins did a wonderful job as the vicious Hannibal, and also as Corky, the schizo-killer ventriloquist in ""Magic"".  I think he just might have pulled off a convincing Norman, but don't believe he was available back then.  Oh well, so much for speculation...Perkins did a great job.",2

19,27 July 2009,mark-lovellsamuels,10, The Perkins Factor,"No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in ""10 Rillington Place"" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in ""American Psycho"". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.",r
20,4 November 2000,Brian-272,9," A classic. Hitchcock's greatest film. Everything is perfectly done and the film has the most famous scene in movie history you know the scene ""The Shower Scene"".","Hitchcock's 1960 classic Psycho has it all to start with romance, embezzlement, disappearance, secrets, voyeurism, a dead corpse, a split personality of a man who thinks from time to time he's his dead mother and of course death in the most famous scene of all time the scene of Janet Leigh getting stabbed to death in the shower. The first time I saw Psycho as a kid and seeing the shower scene it terrified me so much I actually became afraid to take a shower I had great fear of getting stabbed to death even in my own home. As any child would do myself included they grow away from the terror of scare scenes as age increases, but recently I have looked at the famous shower scene from a different perspective. Many are unaware but it took seven days to shoot the shower scene, seventy camera positions for the forty-five seconds of very famous footage not an actual bare breast or plunging knife is to be found in the final cut, just illusion through montage. Now I begin my discussion on montage for those who don't know it's meaning or importance. Montage is a distinct type of editing that brings more drama to film and it links shots of film together and the editing separates and makes a film different from other forms of art. Montage was developed from the Soviet Union. Montage was used in very distinct ways in Psycho mostly crafted from Russian editor and director Eisenstein whose editing technique clashing of images or more properly known as a graphic match in film. Actually both similar terms can be explained first clashing of images create conflict just as in the shower scene the images flashing quickly of the knife and Janet Leigh's body symbolize the action and drama of the film while tied to the music of the Psycho shower scene. The term graphic match is very symbolic to show that life goes down the drain. To explain in the shower scene as Janet Leigh is stabbed and her body slides down with the shower curtain breaking the camera does a very close angle shot of her eye and then the camera slowly but surely makes it way to the blood and water flowing down the drain to symbolize death. This is a great example of graphic match it does exactly what it says by taking two unlike objects as in this case an eye and a drain of a tub to compare the action and drama that just unfolded in a scene with blood and water going down the drain symbolizing death while the eye open and an open drain show that life is no more. Finally enough about the famous shower scene everyone should know by now the story and technique behind it and how it was done to perfection, but I end my discussion of the scene I don't what you to think that your in a cinema history class! Hey don't forget how great a film Psycho is it has several other good reasons for it's classic ranking besides the shower scene with montage to start the intelligent directing of Alfred Hitchcock he simply was the master at keeping people in suspense and Psycho is full of suspense from start to finish. Also another interesting moment is to notice Hitchcock as the pedestrian outside the office in the very first few minutes of Psycho it was common for Alfred to make small appearances in his movies. And Anthony Perkins was great as the best and most liked Psycho character of our time the famous Norman Bates. The character had such intelligent wit and yet evil twisted means. So make reservations to the Bates Motel you will enjoy this classic of strange happenings at a rundown motel. I added this movie to my video library just this year and I recommend that anyone add Psycho to a personal movie collection of their own. After 40 years and beyond we all still have the right to go a little mad.",e

22,18 October 2006,bkoganbing,9, Cleaning Up After Mom,"During the Mid Eighties I attended a science fiction convention in Manhattan and the feature attraction there was Anthony Perkins. There was Mr. Perkins, the celebrated Norman Bates of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho among all the Trekkies and Doctor Who fans, etc. I think he looked on it as an opportunity to promote the succeeding Psycho films.",_
23,13 January 2007,classicsoncall,9," ""My hobby is stuffing things...""","Chances are that if you go into this movie cold without knowing anything about it (I know, that's almost impossible), you'll be about a half hour into the picture and wondering what the title might be all about. Sure Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) seems highly erratic when questioned by the patrolman, but hardly psychotic. It's not until director Hitchcock suddenly pulls the rug out from under the forty thousand dollar robbery setup, and Marion falls victim to the frenzy of a slashing knife accompanied by the now historic soundtrack that's been indelibly identified with ""Psycho"", that we get the idea that this is not your standard mystery.",=

25,6 November 2006,Jonny_Numb,9," ""A Standard Rave""","Strange what the passage of time can do to a film. I remember seeing portions of ""Psycho"" when I was very young on local TV; when our household became cable-ready a few years later and AMC showed actual movie classics, Hitchcock's film was regular on the rotation. I remember being shocked and impressed by Janet Leigh's shower demise and Martin Balsam's staircase tumble, but not too wild about the actual narrative. When you're less than 10 years old, you take for granted a lot of the nuances of film-making that only make sense when you're older.",t
26,26 June 2013,ironhorse_iv,9, I'm a little bit psycho for Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. It's amazing!,"Some critics believe 'Psycho' to be Director Alfred Hitchcock's Magnum opus. In my opinion, it's an masterpiece that set a new level of acceptability for violence, deviant behavior and sexuality in American films. Even before the 1960's, Alfred Hitchcock was already famous as the screen's master of suspense and perhaps the best-known film director in the world at the time. This movie just add to it with subliminal themes, subtext and images. The center theme of Psycho is the concept of multiplies identifies where characters are challenge to live through life under multiplies roles. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is just that type of a character. She is unhappy in her job at a Phoenix, Arizona real estate office and living in a double life with her affect with strong will Sam Loomis (John Gavin). One day, Marion is given money to be deposited in the bank. Instead of depositing it, Marion takes off with the cash, hoping to leave Phoenix for good and start a new life with her love affair Sam. Rather than meeting Sam, she finds a nervous charming innkeeper Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) at the Motel, she was staying. He was control by his over demanding mother. Anthony Perkins gives a subtle performance here. She is taken by Norman Bates innocent charm, as she sees him as the fragile alter-ego of Sam. In many ways, Norman Bates and Sam have very similar stories, the only different is that Norman can't live without her mother, while Sam can. There's hardly a film fan alive who doesn't know what happens next, as the shower scene is probably the film's most famous sequence. In a way, the shower scene was like baptismal waters. Marion had decided to go back, come clean, and take the consequence, so when she stepped into the bathtub it was as if she cleaning herself of sin. I like the fact that Marion's underwear is white before the theft, and black after. Feeling in rage that Marion might steal Norman away from her when Marion suggests to Norman that he put his mother in a mental hospital, her mother strikes Marion, only for Norman to cover it up. When Marion goes off missing, her personality live on with her double, twin sister Lila Crane (Vera Miles) who finds herself staying at the Bates motel, just like her long-lost sister. I love how Hitchcock utilized and probably was the first to establish the writing technique of the false protagonist. The false protagonist is when the viewers are introduced to a character that supposed to be the main character, only to be removed from the story either by death or other means early in the film. By removing Marion Crane from the story, early on. It might offend Janet Leigh's fans, but Alfred Hitchcock's know what's for the best. One of the best image scenes are the mirrors in why show that the characters have multiply personality. Another running theme is the money. The stolen money that Marion carries about with her represents her dirty little secrets. Hitchcock goes so far as to symbolically link this pile of money to a pile of feces. Every talk about money is weaved into dialogue about how filthy it is. While the showing scene can be seen as erotica for Norman Bates; Norman Bates mother sees it as filth. Contrary to a widely told tale, Hitchcock did not arrange for the water to suddenly go ice-cold during the shower scene to elicit an effective scream from Leigh. But Hitchcock did tested the shock value of Mother's corpse by placing it in Leigh's dressing room and listening to how loud she screamed when she notice it there. Compare to Modern Day Slasher films, this film is really tame of violence. The film was known to be nauseating for some viewers at the time, even with it being shot in black and white. The novel is more brutal than the film version. It had a beheading no less in it. Alfred Hitchcock cut it out, and did stabbing instead. Even with its graphic nature, the ""shower scene"" never once shows a knife puncturing flesh. Alfred Hitchcock desire to prevent the shower scene from being too gory so he film the movie in black and white, while also trying to cut cost down. I think, the biggest reason why it is in black and white is because it's better for horror films with the use of shadows. While it is tame, the movie is still disturbing. Hints why the film still have the Rated R label. What might bizarre is how often the film talks about eating. Considering that the writer of the original book, Robert Bloch based his story loosely upon the activities of serial killer and cannibal Ed Gein, some of these constant references to eating could simply be a sly reference to cannibalism. One subliminal theme of Psycho is when Norman chats to Marion about his hobby of taxidermy. It's remind us another Hitchcock classic movie 1963's The Birds. By having Marion eat like a bird, and having a last name like a bird. No wonder why Norman wants to eat her all up, but Norman couldn't hurt a fly or could he. That's actually a form of symbolism. The soundtrack of screeching violins, violas, and cellos was an original all-strings piece by composer Bernard Herrmann titled ""The Murder"" is amazing. It works for the film so well. This film sequels that followed in 1983 are just mediocre at best. There was also a 1998's remake of the film with Director Gus Van Sant that was God awful. 2012 and 2013 was a big high for Psycho fans as Bates Motel started to aired on A&E. Anthony Hopkins star in 2012 film Hitchcock about filming the movie, and also a HBO telefilm call 'The Girl"" with Toby Jones as Hitchcock during the filming of this movie, Psycho.",_
27,28 June 1999,Don-102,10, A Perfect Film.,"Perfect films are few and far between and the filmmakers usually have no inkling as to the top-notch quality of work they are doing.  Alfred Hitchcock thought it was a good idea to make a new kind of suspense picture back in 1959.  Something that would give the audience goose bumps was in order, but bigger bumps must have been the goal.  Hitch had to use his TV crew (from his network series ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents..."" because many film executives didn't like the material.  Little did they know that the big Brit was about to make a cinematic milestone and change the way films are structured and material is presented.  At the time, PSYCHO was a nasty-spirited movie that led some moviegoers to leave early or stop taking showers.  It has held up amazingly well and is far superior to its countless rip-offs.",u
28,1 June 2011,sddavis63,6, I Didn't Think It Lived Up To Its Reputation,"""Psycho"" has gone down in Hollywood history as one of the greatest of horror movies, and even if you've never seen it (which I hadn't until today) you still feel a certain connection to the movie just on the basis of its reputation. That in itself can be a problem, because you're expecting a lot when you watch it for the first time. Unfortunately, for me at least, this didn't quite live up to its billing. It was a good movie, Alfred Hitchcock did a good job of directing with a number of what are today recognized as typical ""Hitckcock-ian"" touches, particularly with some very effective camera work, and basically the cast, headed by Anthony Perkins as motel owner Norman Bates and supported by Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin and Martin Balsam (I would say in that order of importance to the story) did a fine job.

This one, however, is at the top of the food chain.  Psycho is brilliant.  Hitchcock gave this film excellent direction, and the acting was superb.  Especially Anthony Perkins playing the role of Norman Bates.  He always talked so fast, like he was nervous and anxious all the time.  When he talked to Marion Crane about his mother, it gave me chills down my spine.  ""She just...she just goes a little mad sometimes.  We all go a little mad sometimes.""  At that era, I don't think a better person could have delivered that line than Anthony Perkins.  What makes this movie so great is its originality.  Sure, there have been lots of films about ""psychos,"" but this is pretty much the first one.  The script was excellent, the acting was excellent, the direction was excellent, the cinematography was excellent, the music was excellent, the scenery was incredible, especially that dark old house where ""Mother"" lived.

31,16 May 2005,shepardjessica-1,10," Hitchcock's ""Crazy"" Film!","One of my favorites and I think Hitchcock's best film. Made relatively low-budget with his TV-show crew, this movie has haunted me for years and not because of the shower scene. Actually, the best scene is just prior to the shower scene and it's in the parlor with Norman and Marion. The only human connection moment in the film that doesn't show selfishness or ulterior motives. Quiet and full of info, as the camera looms over them, this scene is masterful in writing and acting. Perkins gave his best performance as the timid and lonely Mr. Bates who really is clueless. Janet Leigh is perfectly cast as the sexy, intelligent woman in over her head. The rest of the cast is top-notch and this film should have cleaned up at the Oscars in '60, but was considered too creepy for most folks.",

For starters, when Marion and Norman first meet, you can see Norman's reflection in the window, as if there's two of him. When Marion and Norman are eating dinner in the room with the stuffed birds, you can see that some of the birds are positioned so that their beaks look almost as if they're pecking at both Marion and Norman; something is eating at Norman, and we get to see a premonition of Marion's impending fate. When Norman looks through the hole (which incidentally is behind a picture of two people attacking a woman), we get a POV shot; when Marion is in the shower, we get a POV shot. When Norman pushes Marion's car into the swamp, half of his face is in a shadow, as if he has two sides.",

The studio was appalled by the idea of the film and released it very grudgingly and with the minimal of assistance. Hitchcock had to use much of his own personal wealth to fund it and released it in black and white, with a far lower budget than he was used to. Despite all this, when Psycho was released it changed everything.",
38,21 January 2001,jhclues,10, Nobody Does It Better Than Hitchcock,"Throughout his long and illustrious career, director Alfred Hitchcock thrilled and captivated audiences everywhere, but never before or since as well as he did with the psychological chiller, `Psycho,' which introduced the cinematic world to a guy named Norman Bates.  And now-- forty years later-- even in an age of jaded, desensitized sensibilities, graphic horror and the likes of Hannibal Lecter and `American Psycho,' Hitchcock's masterpiece remains, even after repeated viewings, truly frightening and intrinsically disturbing.  Just as Ingmar Bergman did with his character of Karin in his landmark film, `Through A Glass, Darkly,' Hitchcock presents a character (Bates) at the psychological crossroads of his life, a pivotal juncture wherein he is required to make a conscious decision that will determine the course of the rest of his life:  Whether to reach for the light (and healing), or succumb to the voices beckoning to him from the dark, a place from which there will be no return.  Norman, however--like karin-- is incapable of making that decision, and ultimately must adhere to the resolution of the subconscious, which takes him past the point of no return and subsequently beyond the reach of any help forevermore.  The rest of the characters in the story-- Marion Crane, Lila, Sam Loomis, Arbogast-- are all mere pawns who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are forced by fate to help play out the drama of Norman's twisted existence. 	Janet Leigh gives a memorable performance as Marion, creating a character that was not only destined to go down in cinematic history, but one that would make women everywhere afraid to shower at a motel.  Vera Miles is effective as Marion's sister, Lila, and John Gavin gives credibility to Marion's lover, Sam Loomis.  Martin Balsam gives a solid performance as well, as Arbogast, the ill-fated Private Eye whose encounter with Norman's mother on the stairs is a scene nearly as famous as that of Marion's `shower.'   But the real star of the film is, of course, Anthony Perkins, who gives an Oscar worthy performance as Norman Bates, a character even more chilling than Hannibal Lecter, in that his outward appearance is so deceiving, so contrary to the evil dwelling behind his unintended facade of normalcy.  His gentle countenance and boyish charm are so `real' that after being exposed to him it forever after makes anyone and everyone you encounter in your own life suspect.  And Perkins plays him to perfection, in arguably the best (and definitely the most memorable) performance of his career. 	The supporting cast includes John McIntire (Sheriff Chambers), Simon Oakland (Dr. Richmond), Vaughn Taylor (George Lowery), Frank Albertson (Tom Cassidy), Lurene Tuttle (Mrs. Chambers), Patricia Hitchcock (Caroline), John Anderson (Charlie) and Mort Mills (Highway Patrolman).  If there was any doubt by the time this film was made, `Psycho' once and for all proved that Hitchcock was, indeed, the Master of Suspense.  There have been many imitators before and since, but all of them, good and bad alike, only serve to point out that nobody does it better than Hitchcock.  I rate this one 10/10.",

While Alfred Hitchcock's career is stuffed to the gills with thrilling, horrific stories (""Frenzy"", ""The Birds"") and intriguing mysteries (""Vertigo"", ""Rope""), this film is sort of the best of both worlds; it starts off as one thing and morphs into something entirely different. ""Psycho"" has some of the best subversions of expectations I've seen brought to screen, and that's only looking at this movie from a storytelling standpoint; from a filmmaking standpoint, this film is a technical marvel, and that infamous shower scene is to this day being touted as one of the best edited minutes of cinema history (if you've got the time, check out the documentary ""78/52""- about the seventy-eight setups and fifty-two cuts used in the scene). This is my personal favorite of Hitch's films, and I think it's also the best thing he ever made (sorry ""Vertigo"", ""Notorious"", ""Rear Window"", ""North By Northwest"", and ""Rebecca"").",

46,26 October 2021,nickenchuggets,10," ""A boy's best friend is his mother""","By now, everyone should be familiar with Hitchcock's amazing skills as a director. I've already discussed many films he was responsible for, mainly the early ones that don't get a lot of attention. Now it's time to do the opposite and talk about possibly his most acclaimed movie. Psycho has acquired such a legendary reputation through the years that it is usually considered one of the best horror movies ever. Although the horror element doesn't come into play until you're almost halfway through, this film definitely delivers a large amount of truly frightening and traumatizing scenes, one of which in particular is so well known that most people will recognize it even if they never watched this movie. As always I'll begin by explaining the storyline, which involves a girl named Marion (Janet Leigh) who decides to go into work one day and swipe a huge amount of money from her boss. She does this because her love interest Sam (John Gavin) has a large amount of debt that he needs paid off. After Marion steals 40k dollars, she falls asleep in her car on the side of a road that night and wakes up to a cop tapping on her window. Although she didn't break any laws, the cop is strangely suspicious of her panicky behavior. This later gets confirmed when Marion visits a car dealership to trade her car for a fresh one, even though there's nothing wrong with hers. After driving for some time, it starts to darken outside, so Marion pulls over to sleep at a motel owned by a man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). At first, Norman seems like an outgoing and friendly enough person to Marion, but as they continue their conversation, he gets hostile when she suggests Norman's invalid mother should be institutionalized. After they talk, Marion retires to the room Norman gave her, and he proceeds to spy on her via a peephole in his room that was hidden behind a painting. As Norman watches Marion undress and step into the shower, he makes his move. He sneaks into Marion's bathroom, pulls back the shower curtain, and stabs her to death. He then puts her corpse in the trunk of her car and drives it to a swamp, where it sinks into the bog. As expected, Marion's sudden disappearance does not go unnoticed. Her sister Lila (Vera Miles) questions Sam about the fate of her sister, but he knows nothing. An investigator named Arbogast (Martin Balsam) shows up and says he has an interest in Marion's disappearance, but only because he's trying to find the money she stole. Arbogast heads to the Bates Motel in order to find out what its proprietor knows about Marion, but Norman is actually really cool under pressure when put on the spot like this. He appears very calm while being interrogated so Arbogast can't tell if he's lying or not, but his explanations do have a few discrepancies that Arbogast exploits. Norman says Marion left early the next morning, but there's no way he could have known that considering he told Arbogast he didn't recognize her face. Eventually Arbogast falls into the same trap that Marion did when he asks questions regarding Norman's mother. He at least wants proof of her existence, but Norman turns him down. After trying to get to the bottom of this, Arbogast is stabbed to death by Norman in the old mansion behind the motel. Arbogast's demise has an immediate effect on Sam and Marion's sister, who now realize they have to travel to the motel themselves. The investigator hasn't been heard from in a while, so they are certain something happened to him. Upon arriving, Sam awkwardly strikes up a conversation with Norman to buy time for Lila to search his house. By the time Norman realizes the girl Sam came here with is nowhere to be found, Lila has already journeyed into the mansion's basement and makes a horrible discovery: the rotting corpse of Mrs. Bates is sitting in a chair waiting for her. Norman finally shows up and, determined to protect his secret, tries to stab Lila, but is disarmed by Sam. Norman is arrested and placed in confinement, and Marion's car is pulled out of the swamp by chains. Psycho is, in my and many other people's opinions, Hitchcock's masterpiece. He never really made a downright bad movie, but this one has got to be the best. No matter how many times I watch it, I just want to see it again. I even wish I could get rid of my memories of it so I can experience it for the first time once more. It is one of few movies that has a stellar cast all around, and basically none of the performances are lacking. Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam, and especially Anthony Perkins were all awe-inspiring. The movie also presents a unique idea for Perkins' role, because instead of him being a heartless killer, he apparently does everything he can to please his mother. It even explains in the movie how Norman pretended to be his mother when he murdered Marion, because her soul apparently took over him completely. He talks in his mother's voice and acts surprised when he sees Marion's dead body, suggesting that Mrs. Bates was in control of his actions, not him. Just a strange new take on split personalities. Originally destined to be an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Psycho proved that a longer runtime can very well mean a larger audience. A less noticeable trait though is how it basically paved the way for more violent movies such as Friday the 13th, even though the killing in this is pretty tame compared with something like that. One important fact about this movie that not many people realize is how Joseph Stefano wrote the screenplay for it. He was the same person responsible for creating the popular 60s science fiction show Outer Limits. This blew my mind when I read it because I had no idea. Of course, there have been many sequels, remakes and spinoffs of Psycho, but nothing beats the original story of a psychotic man killing people under the influence of his mother. To be clear, Psycho has easily earned its reputation as not just one of the finest horror movies ever made, but one of the finest films ever made, period.",
47,9 September 2000,Hitch-26,10, The First Modern Horror Classic,"Revolutionary in its time, Hitchcock's Psycho still shocks today when viewed.  It is the standard that every horror movie is judged by.  Filmed in black and white, everything in this movie--the music, the dialogue, the scenery, etc. is perfectly in sync and is a big reason this movie is a classic.  One bad thing is that I read somewhere that one of the goofs in the movie is when Janet Leigh is killed in the bathroom and staring at the camera, you can see her adam's apple moving.  I had never noticed that, but after reading that I noticed it the next time I watched it and it sort of ruined the illusion for me.  Oh well, that was about the only thing wrong with this movie.

After driving for a day and a half, she ends up stopping at a motel only 10 miles from Sam's home. The Bates Motel, operated by one Norman Bates (Perkins) is a creepy place shrouded with mystery, particularly the mystery that is Norman's mother, a driving force that looms over the property and controls Norman himself. When Marion does not show up for work on Monday, her sister Lila (Miles) comes looking for her as well as a detective, Arbogast (Balsam) hired by Marion's employer.

Those strings. And that cinematography.
I realised it's all the little things Hitchcock does that makes him the ""master of suspense"", even in the first act before the Bates Motel is even remotely part of the film, it's still so nail-biting watching Marion make her escape, but when it culminates in THAT scene, christ.
I do feel as though the second act is a little too slow and predictable, however, but the third, and ESPECIALLY that final scene, bring it home so well.

The shower scene is a scene like no other.  Its more shocking than frightening, the instant when the curtain draws back and you are faced with a shadowy figure clutching a knife sucks the adrenalin out you like a sponge, after Marion is viciously stabbed she clutches the shower curtain and falls to the floor, so simple yet so powerful.

Calling someone 'The Master' is terminology that I would usually frown upon as being too dismissive of other greatly talented people, but after witnessing the directing, the cinematography, the subtle performances, the inimitable atmosphere and the quiet genius of this masterpiece, I find myself forced to agree.  The notorious shower scene manages to be shocking, brutal and understated all at once, and its infamy on the pages of motion picture history is well-deserved.  Anthony Perkins is subtly explosive, like a match waiting to be struck.  He plays Bates with a boyish, grinning charm that generally belies his chilling insanity.

Some of his best are the original The Man Who Knew too Much, Psycho, and North By Northwest. The plot to Psycho is amazing, every thing seems more real than you would expect from this kind of film. The screenplay is also great. With very good characters and dialogue. The screenplay is also very daring doing very new things. The performances are also great. Anthony Perkins in particular is amazing but everyone give great performances. Janet Leigh is probably second best in her Oscar nominated performance. She brings her character to life very well, but Perkins doesn't. He just becomes that character, and that is one of the best performances in history.

71,13 February 2005,ryan_kuhn,9," ""A Boy's Best Friend Is His Mother...""","Psycho is an exercise in bait-and-switch by the maestro of playing an audience, director Alfred Hitchcock. What begins as a story about someone stealing money becomes one about murder in a seedy motel shower. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a secretary who is supposed to deposit a huge sum of money, but instead takes it and leaves Phoenix, Arizona, headed towards California. Along the way, she is shadowed by a cop (the classic Hitchcockian theme of distrust towards police) and finds her way to a rundown motel off the old highway, The Bates Motel. Running the once popular, now with ""12 cabins, 12 vacancies"" motel is Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins in wonderful manic weirdness. You know something is askew with young Norman in the very first scenes we see him, but we can't quite put our finger on it. Is it his stuffed bird collection? Is it how he talks about his mother? Is it the way he communicates to Marion Crane in their uncomfortable conversations they have? It's probably the combination of all of the above, but whatever it is, Perkins portrays Bates in such a manner that we know something is wrong with him. In perhaps the most famous scene in movie history, the switch to the money is made. The star of the film, the Marion Crane character is killed off while taking a shower by Norman Bates' mother in brutal fashion. We the audience think we see a lot more than we actually do, if you look at the scene carefully. The scene is 45 seconds long, but features over 90 individual cuts and camera angles, leading to a manic and desperate moment in the movie. The music during the scene, almost as famous as the scene itself, is cutting with the violins, replicating the action in the scene itself. The shower scene in Psycho is pure movie making, showing the audience what the director wants them to see, and in what he hides leaves the viewer to imagine, and sometimes think they saw what they think they saw. The rest of the film plays as an investigative film, as Marion's loved ones try to piece together what happened after she ran off with the money. The star of the second half of the film is Norman Bates as he tries to cover up the murder by his mother, and his paranoid ways really show up during this period. The film benefits from being shot in black and white and the violin-only musical score adds much more depth to the mood of the film. Made for less than a million dollars, Psycho is also an example of what a director can do for cheap. This movie touched a nerve with the movie-going public, as many people feared taking showers for months after seeing Psycho. It has been said that star Janet Leigh still, to this day, has never taken a shower since filming Psycho.",

Going a bit ""crazy"", Marion takes the cash and runs north, thinking this will allow Sam to marry her. But, a heavy downpour makes Marion stop at an out-of-the-way motel, The Bates. Greeted by the motel's owner, Norman ( a superb Anthony Perkins), Marion soon learns she is the only guest and is given the best room. Norman even brings her a meal, over the objections of his mother, who Marion sees in a window and hears from the 'big house"" behind the motel. After she eats, Marion decides maybe she should take the money back in the morning and steps into the shower. Suddenly and ghastly, Marion is stabbed to death by, its assumed, Norman's mother. Norman cleans the place up and sinks Marion's car, along with the money, into a pond near the motel. All too soon, Sam and Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) are looking for her. A private eye goes snooping, too, hired by the man with the bucks, for he can't notify the police. When the PI gets to the Bates, Norman's mother makes short work of him, too. Another car goes swimming and sinks. But, when Sam and Lila likewise trail Marion to the Bates, will more deaths ensue? Is there bigger secrets afoot? You bet! This classic tale of a psychosis and murder is rightly one of Hitchcock's most famous films. DEFINITELY SCARIER THAN SCARY, many folks never take a shower again after viewing it. Perkins is beyond great as the weird Norman and Leigh, Gavin, and Miles do their parts quite nicely. The twist at the end is compelling while, even in black and white, the film's production is stunning. Don't miss this one if you dare!",

On her journey she finds the Bates Motel and decides to stop there for the night. She then meets a great villain played by Anthony Perkins, Norman Bates. As she gets to know him she finds he is quite terrifying while talking. He mentions his mother and says ""She just goes mad sometimes. We all go a little mad sometimes!"" Anyway, later she takes a shower, and everyone remembers seeing the stabbing of her, and the star is dead. The film continues this psychopathic story by having first Det. Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), who is murdered, and then her sister Lila (Vera Miles) and Sam Loomis (John Gavin) come and look for her. Hitchcock has done a superb job in creating suspense and horror, I especially loved the dead mother in the chair, and the great score by Bernard Herrmann, particularly the famous high screeches of the violins (like knives stabbing). Hitchcock's cameo is a man through Leigh's office window, wearing a cowboy hat. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Cinematography. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 4 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was number 56 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""A boy's best friend is his mother.""), Norman Bates was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, it was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Films.

Just seeing how disturbed Norman Bates is, is a very creepy thing.  Hitchcock filmed this without one imperfection.  He used a lot of mirrors in Psycho, and I personally think the scariest scene in the entire movie is where Marion's sister goes up to ""Mrs. Bates"" room, and she thinks she sees someone behind her, and turns around, but its just herself in the mirror.  Another very interesting thing about Psycho was all the bird references.  Marion's last name is ""Crane"" Norman even says to her ""You eat like a bird"" and Norman's office is filled with stuffed birds.  Psycho's shower scene is by far the most suspenseful moment in the history of film.  I think so anyway!

111,6 July 2006,itamarscomix,10, She couldn't even hurt a fly,"Psycho remains the greatest thriller ever made. I consider it Alfred Hitchcock's last great film (apologies to all Birds lovers out there  I'm sorry, but in Hitchcock's standards that movie really was mediocre at best) as well as the best he had made, and the one in which the efforts of terrific films like Rear Window, Vertigo and North By Northwest finally culminated into one timeless masterpiece. Hitchcock knew what most of today's directors of thrillers and horror movies have forgotten  how to build up tension and sympathy for his characters. In no film did he do it better than in Psycho. And so, even if it doesn't seem half as violent and horrific as it did four and a half decades ago, and even if the shower scene isn't as convincing as we'd like to remember, it's still one of the scariest and most effective thrillers ever made.",

The amazingly discreet shower scene is one of the best-filmed sequences of all time, put against the chilling music score by Bernard Hermann that haunts the whole film.

Upon seeing the film for the first time I thought knowing the outcome may make the experience less enjoyable. This was not the case! I now see why Psycho is considered masterpiece! Hitchcock is a master of suspense. As the film begins, the plot immediately makes the audience uncomfortable. As Marion Crane makes off with the money, I had no idea what would happen next. Hitchcock adds in various ideas that lead me astray and even stress me out. When the police officer was questioning Marion and began to follow her, I felt her anxiety. Also when she was rushing the car salesmen I felt uneasy. This is great film-making. The emotions that Hitchcock draws out don't exactly correspond with the direct plot.

Janet Leigh is graciously brilliant in her role as an ordinary woman who is suddenly on the run for making a spur-of-the-moment snatch of $40,000 ($318,875.14 when adjusted for inflation), and Anthony Perkins is without a doubt equally memorable as the underwhelming, well-mannered, codependent manager of the Bates Motel.

Janet Leigh's initial appearance, in her bra and slip, was as risque as any mainstream movie could be in 1960. The immorality of Leigh's character is established right off the bat. Well, maybe. Depends on your point of view. The legendary shower scene was brilliant. The ""illusion"" of nudity is all there was. Janet Leigh was very sexy in the two ""bra and slip"" scenes. However, Vera Miles, in my opinion, was even more sexy-and she never even removes her coat! I guess it's the way a woman comes across. As to Anthony Perkins' performance-he was made for the role. I've never thought the ""twist"" ending was so hard to see coming. Only the genius of Hitchcock could have made everything tie together so well.

Marion seems fairly composed dealing with Norman; he's the polar opposite of Sean Connery's Mark from Hitchcock's Marnie (1964).

This is quintessential Hitchcock, inspired by the true case of the murderer Ed Gein. Hitch then frankly defied the limits of the already agonizing, though still active Production Code. ""Psycho"" addressed such themes as adultery, homicide, Oedipus Complex, transvestism, mental disorder, exhumed bodies, everything exposed both subtly and graphically.

But try watching this movie without Bernard Herrmann's score and it will lose almost everything about it. Hitchcock wanted to shoot the shower sequence (most memorable but over-exagerated scene) without any music. Big mistake. Mr. Herrmann thought so too. And now it has become a masterpiece. Talking about the shower scene being over rated; my favorite scene in the film is where the lady is driving at night and it starts raining and she turns on the wipers and she keeps looking at the rear view mirror and then she finally ends up at the motel. That whole sequence is brilliant film making that owes much of its brilliance to Herrmann's score. You feel her anxiety because of her feeling of guilt for what she has done, and we as an audience have a feeling that there isn't something that pleasing awaiting her at the end of the road. How do we know that? Pay attention to how the fast pace of the string ensemble comes to an abrupt change with pizzicatos and low resonance bows, once we see the sign of the motel. And notice how the cue leads up to that part; pure genius at work here, ladies and gentleman. If it weren't for Herrmann's musical score, this film would be just an average movie.",

The shower scene I think still has the power to shock it was crazy to consider killing off a main character so early. The real star of the film is of course Norman Bates played chillingly and charmingly by Anthony Perkins. He is the young loner who owns the bates motel, says he lives with his mother. The score by Bernard Hermann is one of the great scores in movies. The film is really suspensful if you have not seen it before.

149,22 October 1998,witch king,10, A mind is a terrible thing to lose,"The psychological threads of the film are so complex as to be nearly inexhaustible; this feature alone contributes to its place in film history as one of the great celluloid efforts of all time. Like any genuine work of true genius, it may be enjoyed on more than one level. Alfred Hitchcock forced film-goers to confront head-on just a few of the shadowy corners of the human psyche: the Oedipus/Elektra complexes, jealousy about sexual perceived sexual] rights, guilt, and self-hatred [as in Norman's cross-dresssing], to cite just a few examples of neurotic behavior. Perhaps the most frightening interpretation of the film is that one is responsible for one's actions and cannot, ever, alter the designated course a particular act has set in motion. Here, it is Marion Crane's decision to steal the $40 grand from her employer in order to race to Fairvale to be with her [illicit] lover, Sam Loomis. The opening vista, a bleak mountain and desert landscape over Phoenix [note the metaphor for both the geographical location and the town's name], is replete with the futility of the lovers ever forging a permanent bond with one another. The film is a terrific essay of human desperation and its stray threads: the hunger for sex, for a safe haven, for an ascendant place in one's tiny universe. The barrenness of the emotional landscape is shiveringly mirrored in Bernard Herrmann's shrill, spiky score, which speaks of the desolation of all humankind. Both murders are violent acts of mutilation and hatred, one thinks, not only for the victims, but also for the perpetrator. Fittingly, the killer's ""cleansing"" ritual takes place in a swamp, the normal repository for all kinds of secrets and unclean, dangerous organisms lurking beneath the stagnant surface. Finally, I found most interesting the title on the record label on the turntable in Norman's room: Beethoven's Eroica Symphony [No. 3]. This majestic, noble work bears no resemblance to the music one would justly associate with the tormented mind of young Bates. One can only guess that the boy's impressionable mind was at one time quite normal and receptive to elevated experiences such as a hearing of this great work of Beethoven's, but that jealousy, perhaps having been spurred by an intimacy with his mother, drove the boy to madness. Guilt, one of the human being's great purgatives, finds no outlet here, as we see in Norman's feral smile at the film's end. Hitchcock's use of mirrors works wonderful psychological tricks upon us, forcing us to wonder if what we see in our real and fancied mirrors, is real.",

Of course back then, a gruesome murder wasn't really seen on film before, not such a gruesome killing anyway, but it's highly common today. Hitchcock delivers a heart-stopping, gripping movie which doesn't let down for a single second.

Perkins allows Norman Bates to get under your skin, and he stays there.  He tricks you with politeness and sincerity, then his creepieness seeps in.  Shot on a very small budget, with the crew from the Alfred Hitchcock Presents tv show, Psycho is the ultimate low budget horror flick.  But what Hitchcock was able to do, it take horror out of the shadows, and shine light on it.  The real shock in Psycho comes at the end, where Norman is sitting there in the holding room.

The shower scene tormented her dreams for a long period of time.  I am very glad that she never actually gave me the details of the movie, as I was able to enjoy it without anything spoiled.  From the point of the unknowing 90's viewer, this movie still holds up superbly, and becomes even more amazing if enough Hitchcock documentaries are watched.  I find a couple of things are overlooked though. The greatest scene in my opinion is not the shower scene(although having the billed star die halfway through the film is incredible).  It is the conversation between in the hotel room with the stuffed birds in the background.  Subtle with so many distinct ironies and fantastic underplayed acting, mixed with the eerieness of that background creates maybe my second favorite scene in film(the first being the ending stairwell scene from Vertigo)  Perhaps what creeped me out the most was the visual of that lonely forgotten house atop the hill, definitely embued with some unknown prescence that the audience cannot quite put their finger on.  Like all stellar pieces of film or theater, there is a great deal of humor despite the premise of the work.  The most amazing part of this film is its implication on cinema as a whole - the disturbing material inspired countless psychological thrillers and changed film forever.  Although none will be able to match this movie for the sake of pure cinematic beauty, that's where the genius of Hitchcock comes into play.  He is probably the single greatest director of our time(sorry Kubrick), despite many nowadays not being able to enjoy what they consider ""dated"" films.  *Sigh*",

178,1 May 2019,ChristianLeFeuvre,10, A true 'classic',"One of the greatest films ever made, by one of the greatest directors in movie history.......
Janet Leigh stars as Marion Crane, who embezzles $40,000 from her employer and goes on the run. When she becomes tired whilst driving in the rain at night, she pulls into the 'Bates Motel' and meets Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins. Unfortunately, Marion's stay isn't as relaxing as she'd hoped and she is murdered whilst taking a shower.
There are so many things about this film that make it a genuine classic, from the direction to the brilliant cast and acting.
'Psycho' was so influential to future horror/slasher movies in so many ways, but what Hitchcock did so well was to make Norman Bates so opposite to the usual depiction of murderers in movies, he's not the typical unattractive loners who have difficulty in communicating with anyone, on the contrary, Anthony Perkins is a handsome guy who is very charming in this film, and Hitchcock makes him almost likeable, sensitive and makes the audience quite sympathetic towards him. When we first meet him he is so sweet-tempered and mild, and during a conversation with Marion we learn that he is under the control of a harsh, disciplinarian mother and is almost traumatised by her to the point that, despite being a grown man, he is almost child-like and this is made clearer by a line he says to Marion, 'A boy's best friend is his mother'. We even hear 'Mother' belittling Norman and shouting at him, seemingly jealous of any attractive female guests, and we then get that famous shower scene of 'mother' killing Marion.
The shower scene is still as effective as it was in the '60s when the film was released, especially with Bernard Herrmann's chilling score.
The way Hitchcock builds the suspense in this film, and how he overturns our expectations is unparalleled. The violence in 'Psycho' by today's standards is actually pretty tame and most of it is, in reality, down to the sound effects and the viewers' imagination. And this is what Hitchcock always insisted on, that any 'horror', and the 'scares' comes from the suggestion of violence. It's the way the audience's brains fill in the gaps of the things we don't actually see, that's what's scary, cause no matter what any film-maker can show, it can never be as scary as what our imaginations can come up with.
This movie didn't just have a surprise twist ending, or violent murder scenes, it told its story in a very unique way. Killing off the leading lady so early in the film, the sparse amount of characters, the remote location, the build-up of the tension all these were completely new to audiences at the time, and even today we don't see this done so often, and certainly not done as well as Hitchcock did it.
Nearly 60 years on from its first release, 'Psycho' remains incredibly influential and still very thrilling and scary.

This all time classic focuses on a devious woman trying to get away with stealing money and making a quick getaway when she decides to stay at the wrong hotel one inauspicious evening. This movie is directed by legend Alfred Hitchcock (Vertigo and North by Northwest) and stars Vera Miles (The Wrong Man), Anthony Perkins (Murder on the Orient Express), John Gavin (Spartacus) and Janet Leigh (The Fog). I still love this movie. There's so much to enjoy. The soundtrack and effects in every sequence are so appropriate (though I keep hearing Busta Rymes when it plays). The acting and dialogue between characters is so good, especially the opening marriage conversation that shows how conflicted the main character is. I also loved the car trade in sequence to show how driven the main character was. The mother's voice is awesome, though how you could hear it outside the house, through the rain and into the hotel was baffling but let's not worry about that. The kill scene in the shower as well as the mother killing the detective was all time great, which goes without saying. Also loved the closing psychological evaluation and mother's closing conversation, ""she wouldn't even harm a fly."" It goes without saying this a too well written, executed and delivered to not be a 10/10.",

From the moment Hitchcock tells us it's 2:43 pm and Janet Leigh's character skipped even eating her sandwich to spend three hours in carnal bliss with John Gavin's, to that penultimate shot on Anthony Perkins with a twisted smile on his face, it's quite simply one five star scene after another.",

In addition to all of the macabre details that this film so brilliantly portrays, ""Psycho"" brought on an introductory revelation to the American movie viewer about schizophrenia!! If you have seen this movie, I am not sure if you remember seeing Alfred Hitchcock in it! One of the office scenes he was standing outside!! It is a fact that in all of Alfred Hitchcock's movies that he made a cameo appearance in each and every one of them!! This gave the movie a little bit of a mystique about the direction it was going in!! A director feels that he must have a gimmick to acquire a popularity with the movie audience!! The film ""Psycho"" evokes an eerie genre to the entire make-up of the movie!! Personal problems become a potpourri of predicaments with all of the major characters in the film, Remaining impervious to the thought patterns of a psychotic serial killer gives way to the potential of artistic creativity!! The complexity of emotions in this movie wound up captivating the American public!! Any enormously classic scene in a film, makes this film a masterpiece of the American cinema!! ""Psycho"" ""North By Northwest"" and ""The Birds"" all had classic scenes which endeared millions to these three Hitchcock films!! 1960 was a year for change in America on so many dimensional playing fields... Start with the fact that that was the year that I was born, I do not think that the world was quite ready for me!! I still have my doubts about that one actually!!! 1960 was the year ""Psycho"" made it's debut, and it is considered by virtually every movie expert to be one of the greatest films ever made!!

And while he may not have created the heavens and the earth, he did create something possibly more amazing: Psycho.  Hitchcock once said that he did not care about the acting so much as the technical elements of the film, but he pulled uniformly outstanding performances from Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Martin Balsam, and Vera Miles.  But, as many other reviewers have noted, it was not the actors that made Psycho one of the pinnacles of cinema; it was Hitch himself.  His skillful use of lighting, effects, editing, and camera work have never been evidenced better than here.  Hitchcock's magic was that he could take such a horrific story and make it so beautiful that you the viewer are entranced by it, not able to wrest yourself away for any reason. Psycho is the only movie I've ever seen that grows scarier each time I watch.  The titles are a work of art in and of themselves, the photography is absolutely amazing, and Anthony Perkins's subtle, nuanced portrayal of Norman will almost have you rooting for him.

And forget about the famous (and too much copied) shower scene, or the detective's murder; the most horrifying scene is the one at the end where Norman Bates sits alone, thinking  his mother's  thoughts, and then gives to the camera THAT look- it has me scared sh**less every time I see it.

He hired a lot of the crew from his television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents and largely unknown actors like Vera Miles (who had played Henry Fonda's wife in The Wrong Man) and Anthony Perkins. Another thing he did to minimize the cost of the film was negotiate a contract with Paramount to reduce his own fee for a percentage of the ticket sales.

215,21 June 2018,ferbs54,10, The Modern Horror Era Begins,"It is not every filmmaker who can manage the difficult trick of coming up with four consecutive masterpieces, but that is just what British director Alfred Hitchcock was able to do as the late 1950s segued into the '60s. His 1958 offering, ""Vertigo,"" took time to find its audience but today is recognized by the British Film Institute's ""Sight and Sound"" magazine as the single greatest motion picture ever made; 1959's ""North by Northwest"" is surely one of the all-time great entertainments; 1960's ""Psycho"" practically jump-started the modern-day horror industry all on its own, and remains the director's most well-known film; and 1963's ""The Birds"" is still a baby-boomer favorite to this day. But of those four films, all of which reside on my personal Top 100 Favorite Films list, it is the third, ""Psycho,"" that remains my favorite after all these years, and indeed, I personally feel it is the greatest bit of work that the so-called ""Master of Suspense"" ever gave to an unprepared world. The film was a far cry from its predecessor, ""North by Northwest,"" a big-budget movie that had been shot in lavish wide-screen VistaVision and Technicolor and featured a sweeping, transcontinental story, replete with action and comedy and Cary Grant at his suavest. By contrast, ""Psycho"" was filmed on the cheap, utilizing Hitchcock's crew from his television program ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents""; the entire production was completed in just a few months at a cost of a mere $800,000 or so. But such was the power of the film, and its clever advertising and promotional gimmickry that insisted that no audience member would be allowed admission after the picture had started, that the box office for ""Psycho"" was enormous: around $50 million, a smashing amount of money for the time. And did it ever deserve it!",

This relatively low-budget film is in silvery black-and-white, eerie and beautiful, with gliding camera-work and clever production touches which warrant repeat viewings, however it is much too merciless towards its characters to be a black comedy. It's also not much of a murder-mystery (we have an early idea of what's going on), yet the suspense in the third act is mounted with cunning precision. Mostly, Hitchcock seems curiously fascinated with plot-exposition and details, although the picture is still quite chilling. Anthony Perkins' tightly-controlled performance as Norman Bates is hypnotizing: his boyish good looks can be taken either way--gangly or crazily disconnected--and his eyes, which are frantic, dart around like an impatient child's (it's the role of a lifetime).

Psycho was the first American film where the audience could clearly see a flushing toilet in full frame. Psycho was also the first film to show a women walking around in her under-garments for an extended period of time.

The title in the movie refers to the psycho killer named Norman Bates (Tony Curtis) who's main target is Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), who gets killed by a knife set to the loud music of Bernard Hermann and some scary editing. But the movie doesn't end there, as the killer goes to his mom in the famous psycho house and tells what he had did before he gets caught red handed by cops after he kills his brother.

229,24 February 2021,RonellSowes,10, Pinnacle Of Horror,"After embezzling $40,000, a woman(Leigh) must flee town before anyone learns of what she's done.
Right from the opening minutes, Hitchcock makes it clear that this a film that will go places none have before. Just the look alone gives that sense of boldness. The striking black and white cinematography is a stark contrast to the vibrant colors that had become a trademark of his over the past decade or so. But being the master that he was, he knew that this was the proper way to shoot the film.
The first twenty minutes or so of it, are really nothing like what comes later on. Involving Marion's escape with the stolen money and the suspicion her strange behavior arises in those she meets. Either way it makes these scenes play, because there's still a tension to them.
After trading in her car, she pulls off the road, due to the rain, and into a motel-The Bates Motel. She happens to be the only customer at this remote place run by an odd, young man, Norman(Perkins), who lives with his invalid mother. Anthony Perkins so convincingly portrays the various and changing emotions of his character that you might almost be inclined to think he faces the same mental struggles Mr Bates does. What makes this character and performance considered to be one of the best is the complexity and contrast. Norman Bates has a friendly innocence to him that also touches into quirkiness. But in an instant he can fly into a seething contempt...and possibly even worse. Because in a few hours Marion is murdered by his mother(in a scene that might be the most famous of any film period) and Norman must dispose of the evidence. While Norman may be doing something wrong, Hitchcock still manages to tense up his audience with the car not sinking into the water. Even if you don't want to pull for him you can't help but urge for it to sink-that's why he's The Master.
Now here is where I reveal some of the greatest twists in cinema history; though I sometimes feel that this film has become so well known that many viewers might know what happens before they actually watch it. And that is, Norman's mother is dead and in reality he just has her cadaver and impersonates her at times. All of this is explained in depth by a psychiatrist(Simon Oakland) at the end of the picture, for the benefit of the audience. I probably could spend more time on some of the other brilliant moments in the picture like Arbogast's murder or the final sequence when Sam and Lila make a final investigation and revelation. However, I think enough has been said and those who have seen know, and those who haven't...well you just made a grave mistake reading this.",

240,23 February 2022,gab-14712,10, Hitchcock's Most Impactful Film!,"62 years after release, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho remains the auteur's most impactful film. He made incredible thrillers such as Vertigo, North by Northwest, and The Birds, but can any of these pictures match the cultural and film impact this particular film had? Even though the major surprises have long been spoiled, this still remains a masterpiece in tension and manipulation. Some consider this to be the start of the slasher genre which of course allowed films such as 1978's Halloween to be produced. Hitchcock made some very bold directorial choices that stands the test of time...including murdering the protagonist about a third through the thriller. That shower scene remains one of the most effective murder scenes ever created. There are no knife cuts or wounds displayed. There is a little amount of blood as Hitchcock felt like the audience would not be ready for such gore, but Gus Van Sant later repudiated that fact in his shot-to-shot 1998 remake. Rather, Hitchcock used sharp editing techniques and various camera angles to full effect. Bernard Herrmann's score of screeching violins and cellos is the final straw that made this scene legendary. To this day, it remains one of the best scenes in cinema, in my personal opinion. It received mixed reviews upon release (mainly because critics were forced to see the film with an audience) but a reevaluation was much kinder. Without a doubt, this is Hitchcock's best film (out of many incredible films). There is no denying its impact on cinema as a psychoanalytical thriller. I was surprised to see how much analysis is out there.",

Hitchcock, of course, never won the Best Director Oscar, but was nominated for ""Psycho,"" one of 1960's biggest box-office hits.  Shockingly, Anthony Perkins, in a career-making role and one of the most famous performances in screen history, failed to win a Best Actor nomination -- probably because the performance was too edgy and disturbing (which is what made it great).

252,13 April 2020,garethcrook,9, Timeless.,"Last night we did The Birds, tonight it's Psycho. I always think of these two being connected, it must be because I discovered them close to one another as they've nothing in common. Psycho has that edge that The Birds doesn't really bother with, largely I suspect because of the shower scene and the abundance of stabby stuff. It's a much smaller cast and simpler in its aesthetic, also black and white. I adore the black and white though, I can't imagine it in colour, one of the many reasons the remake was unwatchable. It starts of course with Saul Bass' cool tiles, maybe only rivalled by North by Northwest in Hitchcock films. Saul Bass is a genius. I'll admit I'd forgotten quite a lot of the early scenes, the scary policeman, the voice over exposition as Marion Crane leaves the city in her car, on the run with her ill gotten gains. It's all about the motel and the house though isn't it, but as we get there that fateful stormy night and as much as I love the shower scene, it's Arbogast's interrogation of Norman that always felt more of a pivotal scene, as Norman gets caught in his lie and his (or his mother's) crime begins to unravel. The tension built with the noir P.I. and his death scene on the stairs I always thought was cooler than the shower... although credit to the shower, Tomasini's cutting is superb. I'd forgotten also quite how much happens away from the Bates Motel with Marion's sister and boyfriend trying to find her and the money she stole, but again this all just helps to make the pacing work as well as it does. Psycho always feels dumbed down to Janet Leigh's famous demise and Bernard Herrmann's groundbreaking score, but there's so much more going on and I love Anthony Perkins' performance. Hitchcock characters can often feel a bit flat, all surface, the lights are on, but Perkins as Norman is genuinely creepy and nails pretty much every scene... apart from maybe that last one as he bursts into the basement with his mum's frock on. Psycho is far from Hitch at his best, but it's still a gripping watch. It had my first time viewing partner switching from ""It's not that scary"" in the shower, to ""Oh my God, don't go in the basement!!"" for Mother's big corpse reveal. Not shocking by today's standards sadly, but every bit the timeless classic.",

Hitchcock knows how to get his viewers on the edge of their seat and we see that in full effect in this masterpiece. This film is one of the greatest written story lines and has such a fantastic dialog. This is an art that has been completely lost in our modern genre of ""horror"". Character's seem to have no depth and the killing takes priority over the plot in our more recent slasher type films. Psycho has done so much for the genre of horror.

It is kind of dark to say the Marion got a heavy dose of Karma when she is killed in the shower, but this is where things get interesting. We learn that Normans mother, Norma, has been dead for 10 years. The realization that Norman took his mothers persona was interesting. This film is based on a true serial killer, Ed Gein, who did similar things to Norman. Music was important in setting the mood for specific scenes. Lighting was key in this film with the placement of shadows on the characters. Shadows were important also to show movement of shadows. Editing was important for some of the montages that were used in this film. Overall the film is considered a classic and has set a standard for horror films.

This movie came right after North by Northwest, also by Hitchcock, so it has to be one of the best one-two punches by a director in film history. The first half of the movie, dominated by the character of Marion Crane, is to me, the superior part, without any disrespect to the rest of the film. Janet Leigh's controlled performance is so convincing we feel every nerve-wracking moment after that first excruciating misdeed. From the opening scene over the skyline of Phoenix into the hotel room of Marion and Sam, I was drawn into the movie in a way that only a great movie can achieve. Audiences often complain that a movie can seldom measure up to a good book; however, a great movie can do visual tricks and show nuances very effectively in the hands of a great director. This movie is a case in point. The camera zooms into an envelope holding $40,000 or a peephole where Anthony Perkins, as Norman Bates, observes Marion undressing. The music is like chalk on a blackboard as the sharp violin strings heighten the nauseating fear that we feel along with Marion. The closeup of the police officer in sunglasses is almost terrifying. The pounding of the rain on the windshield is something almost everyone can feel and in this case, it seems like the world is crowding in on Marion. Scene by scene we go from one vignette to another. Vera Miles, as Marion's sister, and John Gavin, as Marion's lover, give brilliant performances as they try to get to the truth of Marion's disappearance. The supporting cast is outstanding, particularly Martin Balsam as Abrogast, the private eye. Anthony Perkins gives his career defining role, although he had many great roles. This was the only Hitchcock role for Leigh and Petkins and they made these characters their own. Highly recommend because it shows the great potential of film/making.",

The way he portrays stories and scenes are spectacular. Psycho is no exception as it is a huge success in the 60s and beyond. Psycho is a very mysterious horror film that follows a couple going to a motel, the couple meet the man who owns it with his mother who lives in the house on the hill behind. Throughout the movie the use of close ups, establishing shots, zoom in shots, low key lighting, low angle shots, and the tremendous acting does a great job shaping this movie. The twist in the end is by far one of the best ever seen I'd written. The use of sound especially when Bates is searching for the woman is nerve wrecking as you hear the violin strings increasing each moment. The over the shoulder shot when the woman finds the truth about the mother creates a shocking moment and reveals the dark twisted secret that lives within Norman Bates. Overall this film is such a good example on how movies are developing into masterpieces with the mind of the creator. Hats off to Hitchcock on this one",
273,5 May 2014,m-visker,9, Psycho 1960,"Psycho is a one of a kind, the fact that there is even a remake of this movie is comical, and the remake compared to the original is laughable. Hitchcock's Psycho is intriguing and suspenseful, however I wouldn't personally call Psycho a scary movie, but it definitely leaves you with an uneasy feeling by the end of the movie. Hitchcock is known for many things, one being his use of McGuffins. A McGuffin is when a movie has an item or piece of information that seems to be important to the story but really has no meaning, it is used for suspense. In Psycho the McGuffin would definitely be the envelope of money, in the start we believe that the whole movie is going to surround Marion Crane and how she will get away with the stolen money. But Hitchcock then throws us off track when our main lead is killed within the first 30 minutes of the movie. I liked this aspect of the movie; I found it interesting to spend so much time on the plot only to completely change it, something I personally have never experienced before. Of course many people know the famous shower scene in Psycho, when Marion Crane is murdered. This scene is used as a great example of the use of quick shots, being that this short scene has so many shots, and the shots themselves are so strategically framed. Not once is there any nudity or gore, never do we see the knife cut Marion, but instead we are almost forced to visualize the violence in our own heads, filling in the blank. Psycho is a classic Hitchcockian film; it really shows and illustrates his style and like most of his movies, is very entertaining.",

The mystique surrounding the film has become almost legendary, if only for the ultimate plot twist at the end of the film. Anthony Perkins, as the one and only Norman Bates, gives an incredible performance of an unfortunately troubled young man, and makes you feel truly sorry for he has endured in his life. Of course, the shower scene has to be addressed, but the music and the events are two special entities. The music, however, is what I feel gives an extra sense of suspense to the already startling moment.

281,9 October 2019,jayjaycee,10," ""A boy's best friend is his mother""","""Psycho"" (OV) is a 1960 horror thriller directed by Alfred Hitchcock starring Anthony Perkins and Vera Miles. There aren't many old films that are still relevant decades after their release, but if there's one it's definitely this thriller. It's the textbook example of suspense and classic horror and in terms of excellence still unreached. It's known that Hitchcock was way ahead of his time and it really shows. How many other films from the early sixties start with a woman only seen in her bra? Also the shower scene shows a lot of nudity compared to the standards of that time. It really shows how daring the director was in his directorial style. To be honest, it all was for the better. The film may have a longer first act that introduces us to a side character, but simultaneously he tricks us into thinking that Marion Crane is the protagonists and makes her death (one of the best scenes) shocking and gives it even more momentum. But in the context of the whole film the storytelling is absolutely well paced and never loses it's perfectly balanced level. Additionally, the virtuoso score by Bernard Herrmann, probably the epitome of suspense, supports the overall enthralling atmosphere from start to finish, sinks it's teeth into your head and won't let you go until the film has ended. The most notable thing about this film though is Anthony Perkins' portrayal of Norman Bates. I've never seen such an incredible performance, he perfectly masters every single character trait of his disturbed nature, as he plays both the shy and somehow insecure manger of a motel and the insane and malicious psychopath, with a strange and oedipal relationship towards his mother, with such excellence. To be honest, this is one the best representations I've seen in my entire life that personally inspires me as an aspiring actor. Just the way he manages to dominate a scene for almost 15 minutes without saying a word, only with his mimics and charisma are enough to prove my thesis. Also the final stare into the camera in the end literally gave me goosebumps. Besides this one-man show, the supporting actors still deliver great work nevertheless, but Perkins stole everyone's show. With unusual camera angles the director thoroughly captures the haunting atmosphere of the horrifying story. Next to iconic scenes, the final twist is one of the most magnificent conclusions of all time. All in all, this horror classic is as outstanding as it's claimed.

The plot twist at the end was certainly uncalled for, and I enjoyed that a lot. The movie tries to make you connect towards some of the characters, mostly with the son, and I almost went with it.

The film is exceptional because of (1) the overall direction of Alfred Hitchcock and his mastery of the suspense genre, as well as his remarkable ability to tell a story with stunning visual beauty, (2) the magnificent musical score of Bernard Hermann which, by itself, creates a level of tension unlike any other film score in my memory, (3) the superb acting of Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh in the critical lead roles as well as a few supporting cast members who very much impressed me, including Frank Albertson as the man whose stolen $40,000 sets the wheels rolling for all of the following action, and (4) for me, the startling design of the opening credits by Saul Bass, which, accompanied by Mr. Hermann's spine-chilling music, establishes a high level of uncertainty, if not terror, even before the movie actually begins.",
291,26 March 2022,a.lampert,10, Re-watched after about 50 years.,"Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. I say that in the context of it being made in 1960. I can see that lots of reviewers don't rate it well but I'm guessing they are probably younger people with a completely different viewpoint of movies which is to be expected. I saw it decades ago but as it popped up on TV recently I decided to record and watch it again. It was astonishing to see in 1960 and although I saw it some years later on TV it was still memorable. Now after all these years I just want to point out what I still perceive as the good points. Of course it's dated in many ways but my reasons for watching would be as follows. The overall eerie atmosphere that Hitchcock conjured up is soon apparent as we realise that Janet Leigh is not the clean cut personality she first appears. Her sense of guilt manifests in her car ride, exacerbated by being followed by a cop. I found her mesmerising, easily her best performance, her sense of anxiousness conveyed brilliantly. At that time Janet Leigh had to be one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood, at least I think so. When she drives up to the Bates Motel is when the chills start. Anthony Perkins, a brilliant actor of his time is Norman Bates, the owner of the motel, seems pleasant, friendly and very cooperative although we know immediately that something doesn't seem right as there are no other visitors, all twelve cabins are vacant. I hope I've written enough for anyone who hasn't seen this chiller yet, to want to take a peek to see what happens next, but watch in the spirit of when it was made in 1960. Ten stars.",

She isn't quite herself today."" does have a morguish humour about it.But it is definitely not a film at which you will do much laughing, if any. Here is a near perfect example of the cinema of terror. it starts off a gripping suspenser about a young woman on the run with some money she has stolen. But then the totally unexpected happens, and we are plunged into a world of nightmare. on the technical side, direction, photography, and music are superb. in the acting side, the performances are varied. But Anthony Perkins is excellent. How he failed to be even nominated for his performance is a total mystery. The same goes for Bernard Hermann's chilling score. Now for the bad news. What stops the film from being perfect is a rather lengthy explanation of the reasons behind what happened, as told by a psychiatrist, played none too convincingly by Simon Oakland. There is also the revelation scene, which if i recall correctly looks to be as if Perkins is giving a helping hand there.

It's indisputable that he makes very good movies from the formal-technical point of view and that he knows how to create a suspense and (or) horror atmosphere with great mastery and skillfulness but the stories he tells us are too fanciful to be real (despite the fact that they are presented as real)and when he dives into the psychological pathology of his characters he becomes much unconvincing. For instance in this movie the psychiatrist's explanation which takes place in the final scene doesn't seem to me to have great scientific rigor, looking more like pure fantasy. Nevertheless it's true indeed that this movie (like others he has made) keeps us stuck to our seats and wrapped up in the story unfolding from the first to the last scene. Only later and after the movie ends do we emerge from that spell to realize that all that has very little juice in terms of psychological reality.

It was so scary when you saw him having that evil smile on his face, in the dark when he just said goodbye to Marion.

331,20 September 2020,kevinolzak,10, First seen on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater in February 1972,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" may well be the greatest motion picture ever made, certainly the best film that ever popped up on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater during a time when availability was mostly left to the bottom half of drive-in double bills. Robert Bloch's original 1959 novel was inspired by the real life horrors perpetrated by Wisconsin necrophile Ed Gein, kidnapping his mother's corpse to care for it and despoiling other graves for food or souvenirs (Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" expertly conveyed the sickening atmosphere of such depravity). In refashioning this normal looking, unsuspected farmer into Norman Bates, balding, alcoholic, middle aged proprietor of the Bates Motel built by his mother, the same events play out as in Hitchcock's adaptation, though despite living only 35 miles from Gein's hometown of Plainfield Bloch remained unaware of the actual crimes until it was almost completed (he was amazed at how similar the dynamic turned out to be living out in the country, a puritanical religious fanatic mother whose son acted out in much the same way as his fictional counterpart). Hitchcock purchased the rights for a pittance in an attempt to go against his recent history of big budget efforts with major stars for a small scale black and white production done by his television arm Shamley, apparently inspired by showman filmmaker William Castle. His chosen screenwriter was Joseph Stefano, listening intently to the director's changes with surprise and delight, shifting the initial focus not on Norman but on fugitive Marion Crane, in possession of $40,000 stolen to pay off her fiancee's debts so that they can marry. All Hitchcock had to do was suggest Anthony Perkins for Norman to engage the audience's sympathy, the up and coming 27 year old actor had already been nominated for an Oscar for only his second screen role in ""Friendly Persuasion,"" while casting Janet Leigh as Marion was even better, a lovely and versatile actress whose star qualities could carry the crucial early section and pull the viewers into her 'private trap' (she lost the Academy Award for Best Actress but did win a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress). Another masterstroke was personally appearing on all the posters with strict guidelines on how the film should be exhibited, no one to be admitted after the picture's start: ""I realize this is a revolutionary concept but we have discovered that PSYCHO is unlike most pictures and does not improve when run backwards!"" Topping that had to be the best tagline ever conceived: ""don't give away the ending, it's the only one we have!"" Filmed on the Universal backlot, where the Bates motel would be seen in several episodes of Boris Karloff's THRILLER, it was a reluctant pickup for Paramount to finish off a previous contract (put off by the violence and adult subject matter), not expecting much of a return under Hitchcock's restrictions and no advance screenings yet becoming the biggest blockbuster of his entire career from massive ballyhoo and word of mouth. He wanted to prove that a relatively minor feature from William Castle could have turned out much better with a decent director on a small investment, and in playing the audience like a piano succeeded beyond his wildest dreams...but where do you go from here? Transforming something perfectly ordinary into something terrifying was a challenge he always enjoyed, and would meet with ""The Birds."" And believe it or not, William Castle himself described his latest plot to screenwriter Robb White, who deemed ""Homicidal"" fairly impressive until he went to see ""Psycho"" and realized that this 'original' idea was a complete ripoff! John Gavin had not seen the last of the Bates Motel, both appearing in the very last episode of THE ALFRED HITCHCOCK HOUR in 1965, ""Off Season,"" directed by a young William Friedkin and scripted by none other than Robert Bloch.",

There's back-story, of course, and the characters are three-dimensional, but otherwise, this is the typical thriller. However, it sets the standards for all thrillers to come after it. The exaggerated murder scenes and the music are two of the most copied horror techniques I have ever seen, and they originated in this film, and only in this film are they artistic. What sets this film apart from others in its genre is the fact that it is not all massacre. There's more suspense than anything else; impending doom. The murderer is not even the central character. A series of strokes of bad judgment from Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), the character who really stokes the fires, sparks a sinister chain of events.

I have now seen four of his movies and I have to say that Psycho is not only among his best of film, but also among the best of the horror genre. Hitchkock's direction was simply marvelous in the 1950s and 60s, and still is today. From the intense facial close-ups to the distant and unusual camera angles, it is impeccable. The music by Bernard Herrmann also adds much to the suspense to the film. I was on the edge of my seat with every beat of the score.",

When I first saw it I was even afraid to take showers as a kid! As the famous shower scene impacted me that much, and many people even had a phobia of staying in a motel after seeing this film classic. Later thru the years after countless viewings I adjusted and saw every moment of the film as pleasure as after I learned how the shower scene was shot I learned to appreciate cinema history and the techniques of how the shower scene was shot with superior montage editing.",

340,4 November 2019,andrewmerritt-31652,10, A horror masterpiece,"Psycho stars Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins and is directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The story revolves around a Phoenix secretary who is on the run after stealing $40,000 and checks in to the Bates Motel. This is my favorite horror movie and is also Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. I could really feel the passion he took to make this horror masterpiece instead of making a horror-movie-of-the-week. Also I want to point out that making a horror movie, a horror movie doesn't need to be in color all the time. A horror movie can have any color tone and still tell an interesting story, which is where Psycho succeeds, and having the black and white tone to it makes it more dark, ominous, and spooky. I felt that tension all around this movie as every department cranks their category from 0-100, that I was sucked into the world of Psycho. Norman Bates is my favorite serial killer. The reason why he's my favorite serial killer is because unlike most serial killers depicted in horror movies, Norman Bates doesn't try so hard. When we first meet him he's charming, handsome, and he's very friendly, but that scene where he and Marion are having a conversation, he becomes a slightly different person, and that's when we realize that something is not quite right with him. And maybe this is just me, but even though he's a serial killer, I still feel compassionate towards him in some twisted way, that made me believe that he isn't a bad person after all. But what I find genius is that the script tricks us into believing that Marion is the main character, but it isn't until the second act, that we realize that she isn't the main character anymore. Its as if the script department were separated into two categories where one half was responsible for developing Marion's character, while the other half was focused on the events after Marion's death. I know I've posted spoilers about this movie, but this movie is too good to pass up on some spoilers. So in the end, this is my favorite horror movie, and I would defiantly recommend this to anyone who is interested in the horror genre. Because to me this is the one that started it all and made other horror movies take inspiration.",

I'm not a giant fan of Alfred Hitchcock but I do find that he deserves his title ""master of suspense"". If it were only for this movie alone. Psycho is the most important modern horror movie since it gave a whole new image to the character of the ""serial killer"". Norman Bates is frightening but there's always sympathy for him. He's the most influential horror icon without a doubt. I doubt that there're many people who don't now about the terrific climax by now.

344,4 August 2015,Maladjusted_1,10, One of the most thrilling titles ever made.,"I suppose it's quite peculiar that I only saw 'Psycho' after seeing around a dozen other Hitchcock titles, given that it's his best- known film. As I pressed 'play', I made the mistake of assuming that it'd just be a seminal slasher film, lacking the complexity of other Hitchcock titles such as 'Rebecca' and 'Vertigo'. I'm glad to say that I was wrong. The score was perfect, and I'm not just talking about the piercing shrieks of the legendary shower scene. It remains amongst the most iconic in cinema, and is just as foreboding as John Williams' score for 'Jaws'. Another winning feature of Hitchcock's horror is the excellent acting. I hadn't heard much about Anthony Perkins prior to watching 'Psycho', and so I was sceptical as to how he could portray a villain as iconic as Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vader. His acting talents shine from the first scene in which he appears, though, and Perkins delivers a truly outstanding performance as the crazed motel manager, Norman Bates. The performances of Janet Leigh, Vera Miles and the other actors in 'Psycho' are just as good as Perkins'. ",

I really liked that Hitchcock killed the main protagonist( in the famous shower scene) and the second half of the movie is about how the death of Marion Crane affects everyone. The end-twist that Norman is actually his mother was insane - I didn't like the ending explanation however - .

One can only surmise that Hitch viewed this seeming rare misstep as a ""necessary evil,"" feeling that those members of his 1960 initial release theater audiences who were born before the ""Roaring Twenties"" would be literally at risk of death if he did not include a hum-drum ""cooling off period"" toward the end, before they'd have to get up on their feet and leave. The crying shame is that all of this now hopelessly dated and quaint THREE FACES OF EVE crud could not have been trimmed to a minute or so in a subsequent director's cut. To hear Joe Stefano tell it, Hitch could not get enough of Joe's reports on Joe's on-going psychoanalysis (which I take for a lack of perception of ""being humored"" on Joe's part). However, this drawn out CLOSING of endless exposition is a cinematic no-no more worthy of Miss Marple than Hitchcock, and tacked on here to PSYCHO it is the equivalent of painting a Hitler mustache on Da Vinci's Mona Lisa!",

His ""...I wouldn't even harm a fly"" face at the end is inimitable. As for Janet Leigh, she couldn't have gotten into her part more.

For 1960, it deals with then-scandalous matters like domestic abuse, voyeurism, and ""split personality"" very well. Everyone remembers the shower scene, but what has always chilled me is the venomously possessive mother-child relationship. Mrs. Bates berates her son mercilessly, showing a sadistic pleasure in emotionally torturing him. So well before murder rears its fatal head, we knew something evil was happening in that lonely house on the hill.

But he does. (Let's not forget to give credit where credit is due: Robert Bloch is the man whose imagination transformed the ghoul Gein into Norman Bates; Stephano fashioned his scenario from the novel.) For those who aren't familiar with Gein, he was a cannibal necrophiliac who wanted to be a woman- his mother in the book and in the movie, but female, period, in real life. He would actually dress up in a ""suit"" made of a woman's skin and dance around his deserted farmhouse at night. (I've always loved the song DANCIN' IN THE MOONLIGHT by King Harvest, but whenever I think of Ed Gein these days- which ain't often-, I think of that song...) THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE was also based on Gein's atrocities and comes closer, I think, to the real horror of what he did, but Bloch and Hitchcock first separately and then combined turned it into one of the Truly Great Murder Movies- one for the ages.",

For a movie whose greatness hinges on its pulsating perfect score, even Hitchcock thought so, it's still a full accomplishment with considerably great performances (specifically Perkins and Leigh), groundbreaking themes and images, iconic editing, and a compelling story. In addition, being a true gateway film for Hollywood to again reinvent itself and allow more risqué films from major studios and major directors. No one worked within but also pushed the bounds of censorship laws and regulations, that plagued many huge productions of the time, like Hitchcock did. Defining violence of the 60's before it would inevitably reinvent itself in movies such as Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Halloween, Psycho truly defined what the story outline of a modern slasher could choose to go with, and most likely make a serviceable picture. Even my mother, who hates horror movies, was bummed she couldn't see it and says she would still like to sometime... that's the power of Hitchcock, effectively making movies serviceable to everyone, but dense enough that those who want a challenge will get one (for his more complex movies), and that's the true definition of a master.

But PSYCHO was made when nearly all top quality directors were making movies routinely for adults. It would be another 8 or 10 years before studios would discover the youth market as perhaps an answer to their financial woes. Flash forward to the present when adults have to hunt for the elusive independent, unpublicized gems that are available today for them.
 Hence this thriller makes the audience wait 45 minutes for the first scare. That script would never get shot today. But when that scare came, it was a pip- killing the star off half way through! Something new had happened here, and Hitch became the first to insist no one be admitted to the theater after the movie had begun. At that time it was common for patrons to walk into movies at any time and stay to see the start of the next show up to the time they 
had come in. Hitch changed the way audiences went to the movies.
 It suddenly became okay for major stars and directors to develop nasty or violent projects that would always be a thorn in the side to conservative producers. Eight years after PSYCHO, Bonnie and Clyde would break new ground too with its technicolor bloodshed in that film.

You show too much, there's not enough suspense. Show to little, and people don't know what's going on. Different angles and lighting can evoke different feelings. Hitchcock is a master of not only coming up with a great story, but telling that story perfectly. Hitchcock finds the perfect balance between terror, suspense, and mystery in all his films, and Psycho is certainly no exception. It is no surprise that one of the most iconic scenes in Hollywood history is in this movie. To top it off the acting is phenomenal as well. Often times with films at the time scenes of strong emotion would be excessively dramatic and over the top.

Although her plan takes drastic turns as she is faced with many unforeseen complications and danger. This film is a clear example as to why Hitchcock is praised as being the master of suspense. Psycho keeps you captivated for the entire runtime. The script manipulates the audience with sharp obscure dialogue. The incredible screenplay is accompanied by oscar worthy performances, particularly by Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins. His character of Norman Bates is easily one of the most compelling aspects of the film. His peculiar nature makes him such a complex and well established character. The music, cinematography and editing work together beautifully, creating such an uneasy and eerie tone. For its time, Psycho was groundbreaking. It subverted the formulaic structures of the crime genre, as well as pushed boundaries surrounding what was tolerated during its social context. Psycho is still insanely nail biting and truly horrifying. It holds up incredibly well, in terms of entertainment value. But beneath all that it is one of the most well made movies of all time. Psycho is outstanding and that is why I give it a 10.",

392,30 April 2019,The_Coffee_Frog,10," Saintly is an ambiguous word- ""Psycho"": Why You Should Watch:","""Psycho""- A review of Hitchcock's slick, insight into an alternative psyche.
""Psycho"" is Hitchcock at his finest, the film was realised in 1960 and was met with staggering adversity. However, as the years passed people recognized it as a masterpiece. The plot centres around a women named Marion (Janet Leigh), who embezzles a large sum of cash, in order to run off with her ""star-crossed lover"". However, midway through her excursion she decides to check into a vacancy for the night at the elusive ""Bates' Motel"", run by the reclusive Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).
One of this films aspects that deserves an abundance of acclaim is its spine-chilling and accurate portrayal of a psychopath. Hitchcock masterfully manipulates the mind of the audience into perceiving things which are not actually shown on screen. Primarily in the notorious ""shower scene"".
Hitch's direction is magnificent and seamless, the characters are well established, the film is littered with cleverly thought out and well placed symbolism and to conclude it all a jaw-dropping/disturbing twist, which will haunt you for the rest of the evening.
In conclusion, those looking for a mindless ""slasher"", then ""Psycho"" is not the film for you! ""Psycho"" may be classified as a ""horror"" but in my mind it will always be a ""psychological thriller"". Simply as must see for any film fanatic- It is also my favourite film. It is unsurprisingly a 10/10.

Everyone has skeletons in their closets. Even those who seem to be as harmless as a fly. (Such as Norman Bates). This movie not only changed the course of movie history, by killing off the apparent heroine 1/3 of the way through the film (making history) but, proved that their was absolutely NOWHERE to be totally safe. It revealed inner demons of the two main characters which reflect on the entire world and maybe the truest description of how the world really is.

Alright, well enjoy your stay and see you in the morning. Or maybe not. Alfred Hitchcock was one of the most influential and fiendishly wonderful movie makers of the twentieth century. Before ""Psycho"", I had seen exactly 22 of Hitchcock's pictures. Most of them I enjoyed but none of them were as memorable as this piece of work. It is not just a cinematic accomplishment but also of successfully portraying someone who is indeed psycho. This movie was a shock when released in 1960 because of the way the movie was laid out. For example, it was unthinkable for a main character to be killed so early in the film. The goal was to put the audience on edge to the point where they had no idea what would happen next. And Hitchcock indeed pulled it off. In fact, he was sure to make clear that no one would be admitted into the theater after the movie had begun. You must watch it from beginning to end.

406,17 February 2021,judemcrobbie,9, Hitchcock at his best,"Sir Alfred Hitchcock may just be the best director of all time. This movie shows why. He masters the art of the unsettling, everything screams that something isn't right. This could be from the opening credits not being lined up geometrically like the majority of movies or how he does not even give you the comfort of numbers when describing time or location. The score is also horrifying for the scene, setting the unnerving tone early, as soon as that motif starts. The majority of the movie is long takes and narrow shots. The narrow shots give you the sense of claustrophobia, making you want to step back but obviously you can't. The long takes make you think they're lingering too long, making you feel you've overstayed your welcome and taking awkward to a different level.
I'm unaware of how Hitchcock makes this possible, but the most average and boring tasks undertaken by our lead, for the first half anyway, make us squirm. Never before have I been so petrified by watching someone buy a car or talk to a police officer, its truly a marvel to watch.
So much of the movie is silence, which Hitchcock utilises perfectly. He uses it in 3 ways: To create an awkward/unnerving silence between characters, for characters by themselves and to actually illustrate how quiet it is in a set place. All of these are in the hope, and they do, create suspense and tension between characters and just the environment in general.
Anthony Perkins' (Norman Bates) ability to create this character that we are so unsure about, leading us at the start to believe he's something we think he isn't but ultimately is. This through the dialogue and through his body language throughout the whole film.
The movie is so unnerving that despite there not being many jump scares at all, the one that are there are so scary. The movie has you so unnerved at time that literally the jump between dialogue and silence and vice versa is enough to make your heart skip a beat.
The amount of twists implemented through the movie keeps you off balance so well that they, in of themselves, get to you
I have only seen 5 horror as of writing this (Silence of the Lambs, Psycho, The Conjuring 1&2 and The Nun) so I'm not particularly adept to say this but this could just be one of the scariest movies ever made, it certainly was the scariest I've watched.",

Now I know the monologue was meant to explain Norman Bates's pathology but it comes across as way too expository. I guess audiences back in 1960, needed to have that monologue to understand Norman Bates' psychosis.

419,8 May 2019,CinematicGarbage,9, Still the greatest horror movie today!,"Psycho was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and was released on June 16th 1960. It was such an iconic scene which made Hitchcock known as a master of making such a horror masterpiece. It wasn't just a horror movie, it was also a thriller and a mystery which made us really curious about the crimes. We always wanted to know who commited it, who was the victim and what clues were left behind.
It was about a Phoenix secretary embezzles forty thousand dollars from her employer's client, goes on the run, and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother. Hitchcock's Studio, Paramount Pictures, wasn't sure enough and disliked the film so they denied him a proper budget and the it was $800,000. The movie was in black and white. They even built a Bates Motel mansion at Universal. Psycho was Hitchcock's best work while he had done some thrillers and horrors like Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958) and The Birds (1963). All of those were one of Hitchcock's greatest works.
Hitchcock also made rules for audiences for watching this film.
""You must see PSYCHO from the very beginning. Therefore, do not expect to be admitted into the theatre after the start of each performance of the picture. We say no one -- and we mean no one -- not even the manager's brother, the President of the United States, or the Queen of England (God bless her)!""
-Alfred Hitchcock-
They were really strict and lucky for me, I'm not a person from the 60s so I can watch whenever I want.
The performances were excellent and I mostly like Anthony Perkin's role of Norman Bates. Perkins was good-looking and that's exactly how Hitchcock wanted it to be just like that so Bates would look like a very likeable person with a charming character and made audiences believe him. They would think about him. Bates even disguised before he kill so that the victims would think it wasn't Bates maybe? He could have not dress because the victims would be dead and they wouldn't know. The way the iconic scene: the shower scene was pretty scary with its noise and when Marion Crane opened her eyes dying made the scene more terrifying and the way she was buried in the swamp was mostly frightening. She was naked and her things were in there. I knew it would be a good idea to bury your victim like that. What a genius! The story was told in a unique way. Even though the movie didn't have much violence, but the mystery were also dreadful and made us worry about what really had happened. It's also a great idea to shoot this movie not in technicolor but still remained black and white. That way would make Psycho a horror masterpiece no one could make like that.
Psycho was really influential, the greatest work of Alfred Hitchcock and also the greatest horror movie and it still deserved that title until today, it's still terrifying and scared a lot of audiences. It's also a combination of horror, terror, violence, mystery and thriller. I would recommend this a must-see for horror fans.",

It is one of the few that delivers to fear and feeling into the misbegotten souls of it's characters. Director Alfred Hitchcock delivers superb direction and forces you to put your trust in ""Psycho""'s many seedy characters. Anthony Perkins delivers the performance of a lifetime as Norman Bates, the poor pawn of his 'mother'. The film, brilliantly shot in B&W, has become a staple in any movie lover's eye. The entire story revolves around the theft of 400,000 by one Marion Crane(Janet Leigh). This theft entangles her sister(Vera Miles), her lover(John Gavin), a private eye(Martin Balsam), a sheriff(John McIntire), and a lonely hotel manager(Perkins). ""Psycho"" is capable of being rewatched over and over again with little secrets hidden through out. Each character holds some secret: Marion stole some money, Gavin is seeing her on the side, Marion's coworker took tranquilers on her wedding night, her boss has alcohol in the office, client holds undeclared money from the IRS, and Norman has the biggest sequel of all. ""Psycho"" also contains the greatest score of all time which contains only strings which was wonderfully composed by the late Bernard Hermann as well as the best directed scene of all time, the infamous shower scene.

423,12 June 2002,Brandon Hall,10, Alfred Hitchcock's Best,"This movie is really the earliest horror film that everyone knows. It deals with a young man named Norman Bates managing a motel that his mother once owned. What role does the mother play in this film? A big one! Even though we only see her one time in the entire film she is one of the main characters. (Possible Spoilers) Norman Bates killed his mother and her lover in bed because he was jealous of her. After he killed her (as stated in Psycho IV) he still needed her and wanted her around so he stole her corpse from the grave and talked to her as if she were still alive. When the film starts we are first introduced to Marion Crane who steals $40,000 from the real estate company that she works for, she then darts for it and before you know it she ends up at the Bates Motel. When she first arrives she is charmed by Norman, offering her sandwiches and milk. But soon she hears Norman's mother talking and realizes that he has a rather dark side to him, the say goodnight and go to bed... or so you think. Soon after we see one of the most well known death scenes in cinematic history-- the macabre shower scene where Marion is stabbed to death by an unknown woman like figure which in the end turns out to be Norman Bates dressed as his mother. When Norman's mother first does the killing he has no idea what he is doing because the ""mother"" in him takes over and Norman blacks out and after he awakens he cleans up the bloody mess in which he believes that his mother has commited. There is much that this film has to offer, Alfred Hitchcock is a true genius! Psycho is one of the most horrific films in history. It is my favorite series of movies.

432,6 August 2005,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10," Hitchcock's best film, by far","Hitchcock was a masterful director... no one can deny his talent for creating and sustaining suspense. He had a gift for making memorable and impressive films, and Psycho is without a doubt one of the most well-known and popular. One of the reasons is of course the famous shower scene, but that's only one of many memorable and well-done sequences. The reason we remember that particular scene is not only how nicely filmed, tightly edited and effective it is... but also how credible it is. We believe in it, despite how little it shows of what it depicts, we believe that it happens, despite all we see is innuendo and hinting. The plot is great. Entirely credible and realistic. The whole film is psychologically accurate. The acting is superb, particularly Anthony Perkins. The pacing is great; you're hardly ever bored. The writing is excellent, both as far as story and dialog go. There are plenty of quotable lines. What makes this film work so well is how realistic and believable it is. What makes it shocking is how surprising it is. What makes this film have such an impact is that it's perfectly credible. I won't reveal any more, in case anyone reading this review don't know the twist of the film. If you are one of those people, watch this before you're told of it. It's incredible. I recommend this to any fan of horror, thriller and/or Hitchcock. 10/10",

To this we should add the supporting roles played by then still beautiful Janet Leigh, Martin Balsam, Vera Miles and John Gavin. But again Perkins was simply excellent. We all were afraid without seeing the killer and until the end we supposed as real the existence of Norman Bates mother.

However, I was hooked in the first five minutes of the film and I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. I love psychological thrillers that make you wonder and think ""outside the box"" and i think this was one of the best i have ever seen. I think that Alfred's choices for the movie, (director, characters, etc.) were great. I thought all the characters did a fabulous job. The story line and plot were very creative too. I felt like i was being surprised every five minutes. I also like that this is an old black and white film.

All the small nonverbal nuances of his performance such as the clenching of his jaw or his aversion of his eyes all come together to bring out this very socially inept and nervous character who you can't help sympathise with but at the same time get a sense of despair and darkness. Not to mention his delivery of his lines during tense scenes which make you question his character and keeps adding to the suspense Hitchcock so brilliantly creates.",

I couldn't wait for it to end, Janet Leigh was the best part, and she died early on! Also, I liked the while twist about the mother, but those are the only things that I really like about it. Like I said it is outdated and Older, so I'll cut it some slack. I do think that the acting was really good in it! I just wish that the movie itself would've kept up with the good acting.

Anthony Perkins is outstanding as good old Norman Bates- the stuttering (also used in 1948's Rope) is an outstanding touch. The shower scene is not extremely violent but none-the-less very effective especially for that time period.

460,20 February 2022,joshua-favaro,10, The Unconventional Horror Film,"Psycho starts off as a film noir and morphs into something unique. We get well acquainted with Janet Leigh's character. We care about someone who did something wrong and is trying to escape. It's an engaging first 30 minutes. It begins to shift when she arrives at the hotel and we are introduced to another complex character played by Perkins. Then there is a twist that I feel is the turning points of all turning points. The movie kills off its main character. This is unheard of and groundbreaking. As you watch the film, you feel lost because you don't have a protagonist to root for; she's dead. Instead you are left in this movie with a psychopath who nobody knows and you feel helpless as more victims fall prey to this serial killer. Anthony Perkins is spectacular, putting on a frightfully natural performance that scares us because his sickness is rooted in real personality traits that we can understand. The master of suspense redefined the horror genre with this classic.",

464,12 January 2001,mcfly-31,7, Hitch's best,"What else can I add about this film?  One of the more famous settings ever (the motel), one of the most famous movie names (Norman Bates), and of course, probably the most memorable killing on film (shower, anyone?). There's no real point in summing up again, but, what the hay.  Leigh embezzels money and skips town.  She ends up at a remote motel and has dinner with the owner (Perkins).  Though long winded, the scene in the parlor stays captivating with the dialogue and the subtle music softly in the background.   They both discuss the things wrong in their lives, his biggest problem, his domineering ""mother"" (and I always wondered if people who haven't seen the film thought of when every critic always put quotations around mother).  She retires for the night, and while unwinding with a shower, is brutally knifed by some woman.  The mother?  You'll find out if you haven't seen it.  The rest of the film deals with Perkins trying to cover up the crime, as others come looking for Leigh.  I say it's Hitchcocks best, but that's mostly based on the fact that I didn't like his other movies (""Frenzy"" was ok).  Performance wise, you couldn't ask for much more, as Perkins is terrifically understated as Norman, the role that pidgeon-holed the rest of his career.  He pretty much carries the film as the others, good actors no doubt, have little screen time.  A sequel followed 23 years later(!), one I went for more being a kid of the 80s. Part III was good as well (Perkins directed nicely), but IV was a lame made for cable film.  There was also an awful remake in 98, check it out at your own risk.  As far as the beginning of it all, it can be slow in spots, but is a well told story and one of only a few films before the 80s that I liked.",
465,9 December 2014,Emillion,9," ""We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you ?""","Easily one of my all time favorite movies. Hitchcook never disappoints and Psycho is no exception. The story is very simple and straight forward with a great twist at the end that catches audience members by surprise ( although I wasn't so easily fooled. Hitchcook using several foreshadowing techniques and focused shots to push the audience towards a conclusion. His shots, while often simple, are very effective; for example the low lighting and the back-lit people allows the audience to see the outline of the killer but no specific details beyond that. The shower seen was especially brilliant with a wide variety of rapid shots and insinuated actions. Overall the film is amazingly made and a stepping stone for all psycho thrillers to come.",

Embarrassingly enough I had just watched this movie recently for the first time ever and of course loved it. The film is filled with so many twists and turns from beginning to end that kept me on my toes, although I already knew of most of them already because I'm clearly the only person who hadn't seen the film. I loved the plot of the movie and how the viewer starts off thinking about the girl and the stolen money, when in fact it isn't about that at all. I also believe that this film is one of the best examples of Hitchcock's mastery of suspense. There are so many scenes that are filmed in such a way that really amps up the viewer's anxiety and I'm not just talking about the shower or stair scene. I think the scene that really showed this was towards the beginning of the film when the cop pulled up behind the woman. I loved how they filmed this scene because they filmed the cop from the point of view of the driver side mirror, which kind of made you anxious because it made you feel like you were being pulled over. I could say so much more about the greatness of this classic, but I'm going to stop before I repeat everything else that has ever been said about this movie.",

Yes, it's macabre master himself, Alfred Joseph Hitchcock, British film maker who makes a film for the American audience. This man is not afraid, he is bold, brainy, and very well rounded in his work. And this movie is in my opinion, one of the best he's ever made. Janet Leigh(1927-2004) did an outstanding job playing the thieving Marion Crane. The question does puzzles me in the beginning of the film is why was she wearing white bra and half-slip? ",

This, all while keeping the movie moving along at a brisk pace. At no stage does it drift, or get bogged down. It's the shower scene that is most talked about in this film, I believe there are couple or more scenes that are under rated yet very impactful. I was terrified by the climax shot where the mother is shown, more than anything else. I recommend this film to everyone.

Whether or not it's his 'best' is up for debate; but no matter what; it's definitely up there. Psycho is the film that inspired the entire 'slasher' sub-genre, and is also a textbook example of how to make a thriller. Every shot in the film is perfectly orchestrated, and by keeping the immediate action simple; the master director is able to fully focus on the proceedings, making the resulting film more thrilling. The influence that Psycho has had on cinema overall is astounding, and it's hard to imagine cinema now without this film. The fact that over forty years on, Psycho is still better than every film it influenced is no coincidence. The plot follows Marion Crane; an office worker who is entrusted with $40,000. Seeing her chance to escape her mundane life, she takes the money and runs. Unluckily for her, she stops at a small roadside motel; The Bates Motel.

However, once in a while, comes along a psychological horror film that is able to rattle the sense of being and challenge the moral compass of an individual, and ""Psycho"" is one of those films. Needless to say the real fear elicited from the film is that fact that a monster resides in such a normal, compassionate, and kind Norman Bates. Hiding his true intentions, he turns into one of the most provocative killers ever portrayed in any movie and has become a cultural icon. The shower scene in particular needs mentioning, the killing out of context doesn't really have an impact, but taking into account that the protagonist has just been killed about halfway through the movie gives a sense of vulnerability and is truly a shock that is worth noting. If you haven't seen this film, watch it.",

In this psychological thriller, viewers are left screaming at their T.V. screen trying to tell the characters to get out while they can.

Halloween and Jaws are, to me, the two best horror films ever made. And even though I don't think Psycho is on par with some of the best horror films ever to grace our screens, you have to give credit where credit is due. Psycho is a pioneer for horror films and it is because of Psycho that we have films like Halloween and Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre and directors like Hooper and Carpenter and Craven. I was born 12 years after Psycho was made and I really didn't get into film until at least another 10 years after that, but I can tell you that Psycho must have shocked and revolutionized film. Could you imagine a film maker so bold as to tell theater owners that they are not to permit anyone into the theater after it starts? Can you imagine a film so bold as to kill the main character half way through the film? Can you imagine a film so bold as to kill someone so graphically in the shower? Sure you can imagine all that. It's 1999. This film is almost 40 years old. But imagine what it did to audiences in 1960. It must have shocked the hell out of everyone back then. Psycho is a film like no other.",
487,30 June 2000,Andrew-162,10," Hitch's 2nd Best, But That Is Saying A Whole Lot","Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho is probably the best horror movie ever made, and though slightly inferior to his Vertigo, it remains a true showcase of the master's talent. Though I was not around the 1st time the movie came out, I was lucky enough to recently catch a screening of it, with a guest appearance by Janet Leigh. I had already seen the movie twice, and anticipated everything that was about to happen, but it didn't really matter. It still scared me so much, I was petrified to think how terrified I would be if I saw it in the theaters in 1960, not knowing what was about to happen. We all know the plot--Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) embezzles 40,000 dollars from her company and is on the run. She stops at the Bates Motel where she meets Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a friendly young man who is restrained from being close to anyone but his possessive mother. They talk, and she gets in the shower. Before she is done her shower, she is stabbed to death by Norman's mother. But who really stabbed her? And is she really dead? Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) and Marion's boyfriend (Jon Gavin) hire detective Arbogast (Martin Balsam) to investigate. Then he is similarly stabbed to death before he can question Norman's mother.... Psycho is simply amazing, one of the true artistic pieces of the cinema. Joseph Stefano's disturbing, sick screenplay will not soon be forgotten, though the plot is not the main part of the movie. The cinematography is some of the best ever put on the screen, from the several pans from the Bates Motel to Norman's house to the opening shot across the city. It is dark--undeniably bleak and dark, as is the mood of the movie. The art direction is necessarily scary--Norman's house is perfectly secluded from the rest of the world, and looks very spooky, as does the motel. As Balsam notes, the hotel seems to be ""hiding from the world."" The acting varies--Balsam is quite good as the always suspicious detective, Leigh is ideally cast as the every day woman who sees a chance to get away from life and takes it, and Perkins is nothing less than fantastic as Norman Bates, a roll that would define his career, and one he will always be associated with. However, Miles and Gavin are wooden anti-characters with no personality whatsoever showing. But that really doesn't matter. Hitchcock liked the idea from the start--getting a big star and killing her off in the first reel. It certainly shocked audiences, who before came into movies whenever they wanted, sometimes even 30 minutes to an hour into the movie. They were not allowed to do that with Psycho. ""The film you should see from the beginning--or not at all"" the taglines stated. Psycho is a perfect example of audience manipulation--everyone assumes that the story is about Leigh, and when she gets bumped off, Hitchcock takes the audience down a completely different road. The shower scene is one of the most memorable and suprprising scenes in film history. The scenes in which Leigh is driving are suspenseful, even though there's nothing really happening. And when Perkins is trying to dispose of Leigh's car by pushing it into the swamp, the way the car stops sinking for a second--everyone suddenly wonders what he will do now--but then it sinks away again. Surprisingly enough, the audience wants the car to go down--we want Perkins to get rid of the evidence. And untrue to Horror formula, the climax of Psycho takes place not in a rainy dark night--but in the bright, sunny daylight. These are all examples of audience manipulation--which no one does better than Alfred Hitchcock. But yet--Hitchcock's direction, I think, is not the best part of the movie--or at least it is tied for first. The best? BERNARD HERRMANN. If you do not know that name yet, write it down. BERNARD HERRMANN. He has done the score to the Hitchcock movies Marnie, The Birds, The Wrong Man, North By Northwest, Vertigo (ohh, the Vertigo score), and Psycho. He also did the score to Scorcese's Taxi Driver, and Orson Welles' Citizen Kane. He won an oscar for his score for The Devil And Daniel Webster. His score for Psycho is certainly his most well known--especially the shower scene part. Though not his best (Vertigo is his best) the score is the part of Psycho that stays with you after the film is done, days after. That keeps haunting you, that keeps scaring you. Psycho would be three or four times less scary without the shrieking violins of Herrmann's score. Herrmann also pulled an exercise in audience manipulation--for the score, frightening as it is, consisted of only 4 violins. The music truly sets the mood for the movie. Creating the madness and worry in Marion's mind while she is driving, creating the true horror of the murders, and creating the calm but suspenseful serenity of some of the dialogues, where there is no music at all, and the film is eerily silent. You know the shrieking violins are soon. Bernard Herrmann's scores are not often enough credited as a huge, HUGE part Hitchcock's success with his pictures. So write that name down if you don't know it already: BERNARD HERRMANN. And see Psycho. If you've already seen it, see it again to catch the little things you missed before. I guarantee you there are some.",

Alfred Hitchcock is described to be one of the great American film directors, and you can see why after watching this film.

The double exposure of Norman and his mother's skeletal face over his was also really artistic and shocking. I was really surprised at the ending, and it was a really satisfying end to all the build up of tension.

What this movie managed to do at that time in the 60's was remarkable. There had never been anything like this made up to that point. It's the start of a great sub genre known as the ""slasher film"". The story is of a troubled man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and a woman on the run named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). Marion leads an unfulfilled life and one day decides to embezzle $40,000 from her employer. While on the run, she stops off at the infamous Bates Motel to think things over and get some rest. While taking a shower, an unseen assailant who resembles a large woman attacks her with a knife, killing her. We soon are led to believe it's Norman's mother who committed the crime. It's then we see Norman cover it up for her. Many people question the whereabouts of Marion over the next few days including her boyfriend and sister. They, with the help of a private investigator, discover she was at the Bates Motel. But when entering the house up on the hill behind the motel, the discovery they make is much more chilling then could ever be imagined.",

The plot of the bathroom murder in psycho has long been a classic scene in film history, which was later called the model of using parallel montage. In the entire murder scene, although there is not even a picture of a knife inserted into the body, but through the use of montage techniques, the audience is still scared, to bring the audience a naked thriller. 45 seconds, 78 shots, knife, human body, sprinkler head, curtain, lower water hole, repeatedly switch between the murderer and the murdered quickly, the knife stabbed at the body of the different positions of the group, coupled with the switch between the water in the sprinkler head and the curtain, lower water hole, produced a kind of thriller effect the director is eager to get. As Hitchcock put it: ""the most intense thing is not the disgusting way people die, but the atmosphere that simmers before they die.""
Made up entirely of close-ups and close-ups, the murder scene is fast, fast-paced and powerful, creating an impressive sense of terror and excitement. It's worth noting that there is no dialogue in this scene, only action, expressed on the screen in cinematic language. It is therefore horrifying, frightening and exciting, which is completely conveyed to the audience by the tension and information of the images.",

501,30 December 2007,HelloTexas11,10, Hitchcock's best,"'Psycho' has long been a favorite of mine, though for a long time I was unable to explain exactly why. It wasn't a horror film, at least not in the way I generally thought of them; there's no monster and there are no supernatural aspects. It fits more into the murder mystery category. But it has the feel of a horror film and of course today is usually regarded as such; in fact, many regard it as the best horror film ever made. Alfred Hitchcock, it seems to me, knew exactly what he wanted 'Psycho' to be and didn't worry about categories. An aura of desperate fear and paranoia permeates the film from start to finish, enveloping all the main characters. Janet Leigh's Marion Crane, in particular, is the very picture of someone on the edge, constantly looking over her shoulder, always afraid of being discovered. Her character is all the more believable because Marion Crane seems like the last person one would expect to behave as she does, stealing $40,000 from the office she works at so that her lover (John Gavin) can pay off his debts and they can be together. It is a rash act for a woman who initially seems like your typical office worker, leading a humdrum existence except for the stolen moments she shares with her lover. But she acts on her dream because she is desperate, and desperation drives her. 'Psycho' is atypical in many ways. For one thing, Crane, who is clearly the focal point of the film, is killed fairly early on. The emphasis then shifts to Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), his mother, and other characters who are trying to determine Crane's whereabouts. Bates seems to acquire Crane's mantle of paranoia, at first certain no one will ever come looking for her and even if they do, will never discover that his 'mother' killed her. Seeming a quirky but harmless momma's boy in his early scenes, Bates is slowly revealed to be insane- the 'psycho' of the title. Shot in black and white on a modest budget, 'Psycho' didn't seem to be anything special upon release. Most critics were less than impressed. But audiences certainly took to it, making it one of Hitchcock's most successful films; it grossed $32,000,000 (a huge sum at the time) and subsequent re-issues and television showings added to that figure. And since then, its reputation has grown with each passing year, with reams of film criticism devoted to it and dissecting it. Regardless of the category one wishes to fit it in, horror/thriller/mystery/crime drama, it has long since passed needing such labels, now simply regarded as Hitchcock's most well-known work, possibly his best, one that regularly makes all kinds of cinema 'top ten' lists for best film ever. Bernard Herrmann is easily as crucial to the movie's success as any of the actors; his music score has become irrevocably linked to key moments in 'Psycho,' the shrieking violins almost a trademark. The infamous 'shower scene' has become a part of pop culture history, discussed and parodied countless times. And Anthony Perkins will rightfully be remembered always as Norman Bates, forever reminding us that ""a boy's best friend is his mother.""",
502,29 June 2020,gcanfield-29727,10, Hitchcock's masterpiece,"Strictly in terms of horror, there is only one movie I would rate higher than this one. That would be the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Both films were inspired by real life whacko Ed Gein. Psycho is brilliant due to Hitchcock's subtle direction. Janet Leigh sporting only a bra and slip was very much ""pushing the envelope"" in 1960. Then, on to the notorious shower scene, which creates an illusion of nudity, combined with the sheer terror of the scene. Personally, I would have liked Vera Miles better in the Janet Leigh role. Vera was much prettier and infinitely more sexy! Not only do we not see Vera in her underwear, but she never even takes her coat off! Am I going on about Vera Miles? So, I am! Beautiful lady and great actress. As for Anthony Perkins, his great performance speaks for itself. Not much else you can say without giving too much away.

503,12 May 2015,cjlance8,10, Psycho Review,Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchcock was an amazing thriller movie. Hitchcock kept you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie. This movie is flawless and the cinematography is perfect. Using the shadows and covering up the killer in the shower scene was perfect. It couldn't get any better. The shower scene is one of the best scenes I've ever seen in any movie. The camera zooms in as she showering to the shadowy figure in the background. Then he opens the curtain and the score music comes on which was perfect and fit so well. While he is stabbing her his whole figure is still hidden and you can't see his face. Then he leaves the bathroom as she's dying and the camera is just focused on her hand as she is slowly dying. It was perfect and just gave me that weird feeling. I loved it. That scene describes a horror movie perfectly. The acting job too during that scene was great. She made it look so realistic and it was spectacular.,

Bates' strange naivety yet obsessive personality is shown through his facial expressions alone. The way the tone of his voice changes when sensitive topics come up has a subtle brilliance. The film does have a few immersion breaking moments. The long overly long fall down the stairs, meant to increase suspense, instead reminds the viewer they are in fact just watching a movie. The quick explanation scene at the end breaks the mood as well. However, the film still thrills perfectly except for a very few short instances.",

Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane, wonderfully played and delivers a fine performing main iconic role. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is very seemingly charismatic on first impressions. Yet is very troubled and eccentric. Sneaky and sideways glancing. With his strange hobby of stuffing birds. All the characters are extremely detailed. The film has so many clever aspects. Atmospheric, orchestral, suspense, the music alone provides all of these essential key areas as well as the visual side. Then there's the mysterious, nagging, possessive mother of Bates who you don't see who dominates him. Strange how bird references come up in this, Hitchcock's fascination. Loved his cameo near the start. The shower scene comprises of utter genius in how it is shot. A stabbing, thrusting, shadowy figure relentlessly going crazy with a deadly blade. Marion's outstretched hand leaving a shocking farewell to her life cruelly ripped away. A close up of her eye, the final montage. Again it's extremely clever how the whole shower scene leaves a bitter taste yet never shows us anything in the regions of graphic violence. Leaves the audience, the viewer's mind to fill in the blanks. A shocker twist regarding the killer and a final revelation at it's peak. An intelligent film from the old master Alfred Hitchcock.

It has good acting, good directing, excellent cinematography, plenty of mystery and awesome suspense. Along with that, one particular scene involving Janet Leigh in the shower is possibly one of the most memorable horror scenes ever filmed. Having said that I believe it should be pointed out that this movie is 53 years old (at the time of this review) and as a result it doesn't have the graphic imagery or gore that some people are accustomed to today. As a result there could be some viewers who might miss the subtle touches a real master like Alfred Hitchcock was able to implement to such a fine degree. Equally impressive was the acting of both Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins (as ""Norman Bates""). As a matter of fact, Janet Leigh was nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe Award for ""Best Actress"" for her performance.

The sound design and soundtrack are utilized so artfully in making the film as suspenseful and thrilling as it is. You can't mention this film without mentioning the iconic ""shower scene"" which is just a masterclass in filmmaking. The use of cuts, a cut for every slash of the knife, and not a single one containing an actual mark on Janet Leigh's body. The constant cut of the camera and jump to blood running down the drain lets your brain piece it all together without showing almost a single thing.

The film is culturally significant as it portrayed a villain that was not one dimensional but rather detailed. The ending scene where Norman Bates, while dressed up as his mother stabs Marion is iconic. This scene along with the classic music and sound that went along with it is unforgettable. The concept of Psycho has even been re imagined as a television series, since it remains so popular even today. The movie had great acting, and Norman Bates character made the film. He was eccentric and crazy, talking to his dead mother, and even 'becoming' her at times. The setting was ominous and creepy. There was this empty motel with this looming mansion above it on a hill. It emanated spookiness, and added to the mise-en-scene of the film. The movie gave a great feeling of intrusion, and the lack of privacy which made the movie scary and unsettling. Overall the film was an excellent piece of psychological horror that still resonates with fans today.",

(2) The mood setting music be it the sharp violin sounds of Psycho, the chi chi sounds of Friday the 13th creates a chill in the back of the audience. (3) The unpredictability of the unbalanced character in a creepy way. Norman Bates' odd conversation with the hotel guest create and uncomfortable uneasiness which resonates with the audience.

It's the buildup that matters, whether Janet Leigh's negotiating the open road with a guilty conscience or just stepping into the shower. I knew exactly what would happen, but I still couldn't look away. Hitchcock knows how to ratchet suspense; it's like seeing the master at work.

'Psycho (1960)' is extremely unconventional, too. Its writing is simply fantastic. It feels as though the film it wanted to be is callously cut down at its mid-point, forcing it to follow a new and altogether darker path. An epilogue exposition sequence feels somewhat tacked-on, but it provides insight into a key character's psyche and arguably enhances what comes before it.

Experience it first and then learn so much more.) It pained me when I heard that M. Night Shyamalan compared himself to Alfred Hitchcock. Where Shyamalan's movies are simply dreadful, half-assed, slow and contain hilariously bad scripts, Hitchcock remains the master no matter what year you watch his films. 'Psycho' is my all-time favorite Hitchcock film, and one of the best suspenseful movies of all time. It has such depth, both the intriguing (even today) story and characters, never a dull moment was experienced here. And talk about before his time; this movie was ingenuous: The main character is not only enormously flawed (a Hitchcock staple, and one I love so much about his films – see: 'The Birds') but she dies half-way through the feature, leading the way to another, more iconic main character: Norman Bates. I personally wasn't around in 1960, but I'm sure this caused quite a stir with its graphic scenes (by today's standard, this is PG) but I'm glad they didn't just go for the gore. The story, acting, cinematography, and especially the incredible score, were all brilliant. Everything about this movie is excellence, and I am glad that this and that famous shower scene is studied in film classes. This is what movie-making is all about. Marion is attempting to ""escape"" with the man she loves by stealing $40,000 to pay off his debts. Though her ""inner-voice"" gnaws away at her since the theft, just as her conscious gets to her, Bates and his mental illness (shown superbly and believably by Perkins) puts an end to that.

The constant change made the movie exciting to watch. Another thing I noticed were that almost every character felt like a REAL character.

On the other hand when the viewer meets Marion Crane she is seen as a woman in a hotel room with a man and stealing money from her boss. The viewer sees her as the criminal but really she was a good person who made a mistake that she was prepared to make right.

I like thrillers though and I've seen many movies with psychopath serial killers (se7en, the silence of the lambs, identity, zodiac, criminal minds...). So I thought, it's a serial killer black and white movie from 1960, how scary can it be? I've never been so wrong. I was familiar with the split personality thing from other movies and so I guessed that Norman and his mother were one person very early. And in the scene in the basement I was almost sure that we would see a skeleton sitting in that chair. The movie wasn't shocking or twisting at all for me. AND YET IT SCARED THE S*** OUT OF ME! It's been three days now and I still have trouble sleeping. I'm not sure why, I mean I've seen much more troubled psychopaths and watched much more brutal murders and wasn't scared a bit. Alfred Hitchcock is definitely a genius. Music is excellent and it seems that it plays a big role in scaring the viewer. Right now, I feel like I don't want to watch a horror movie again.

Psycho is a must watch if your interested in watching a suspenseful horror film. Vera Miles as Lila Crane does a great job in this film and her character is outstanding.

556,23 January 2009,Dr_Coulardeau,10, God is paranoid and Satan is psychotic,"This black and white film needs that black and white artistic elaboration to find its complete value. We are entering a progressive descent into some kind of hell but we go down one step at a time without knowing there will be more steps after this one. This descent is represented in the film by the steps going up to the house behind the motel, then the steps going up and down from one level of the cabins to the next, then the staircase inside the house going up to the rooms but also going down to the fruit cellar. This image, which is a metaphor of the mind when it is swallowed up by insanity, is essential and cannot be in color because an insane mind is a whole set of hues and shades of grey. But Hitchcock in this case constructs the plot itself that way. Sexual temptation for the boy friend, then mutual and reciprocal financial temptation for the money and the girl, then the run, the escape. And then one step at a time the trail is getting hotter and hotter. The boss seeing her driving out of town. The cop finding her asleep in her car on the shoulder of a road. The cop following her and observing her swapping her car for another. The motel to escape the rain and get some rest. The sandwich and the milk, the discussion and the mental trap for her, the poor thief, and for him the poor surviving son. And you can go on and on and that will lead you to the end, but with only one question in your mind. How is it possible that such doom can fall upon someone? But who is that someone? The son, Norman Bates, a killer of his own mother and her lover who was left free to survive in society? The poor thief Marion Crane who was trusted with the un-trustable, so much money that her jaws fell down? There is in this film, maybe more than in most Hitchcock's films, the sense of some kind of doom or fate or destiny governed and controlled by some kind of insane authority. Hitchcock was showing then the God he never alluded to in this film that was governing this world must have gone not AWOL as some may say but insane, frankly schizophrenic. For this sinister world to make sense, you need to state that the master mind of our cosmos is a double personality, good old god on one side and good old Satan on the other side and the fight between the two are not even close to the beginning of an end and our lot will be like that tossed from the benevolent hand of god into the malevolent hand of Satan and/or vice versa as many times as these two will find some pleasure in doing so, as long as we will not cut the branches and the roots of this divine and devilish schizophrenia that is finding its source in our very flesh and mind and that is outsourced by our spirit or brain into some autonomous though totally virtual, an absolute simulacrum, of reality, an outsourcing movement that gives us the illusion of sanity paid for by that mental and spiritual alienation that the invention of these two supernatural beings represents for us. Better be alienated in spirituality than divided in reality. That explains so well the fact that such lines of thinking and representing our own experiential life can lead to all kinds of possible bigotry and fundamentalism, as soon as we decide we are standing on the only side worth it, that is to say the side of good, the side of god, the side of light, without understanding that there are so many shades of light and so many hues of shade that if we all stand one-sided and one-spirited and one-minded for what each one of us consider as pure light we are absolutely doomed to commit our daily genocide every day between our morning shower and our breakfast, just as an appetizer for our day of labor. And Hitchcock builds that fate upside down for the poor Marion Crane: the genocide of Norman Bates' mother happens between Marion Crane's evening snack and her before-going-to-bed shower, a shower she will never finish taking and that will be turned into a long bath in some muddy pond. The final and concluding image of the car containing the body and the money being pulled out of the pond is the wink Hitchcock addresses to us for us to go back in time and enjoy the film as a rotten metonymy of real life. He even imposes onto us a five minutes psychological ranting discourse from the local psychiatrist to convince us that all is normal since everything is upside down, but is it? Is it not the reverse: everything is upside down since all is normal, or is it everything is normal because all is upside down, or whatever? Add a touch of color to that film and you will produce a big meaningless mess. Black, white and grey become death so well, just like mourning becomes Elektra.",

From the beginning of the film, we as the audience believe that the film is primarily about Marion, but once she does we really see the what the premise of the film is. Anthony Perkins does a fantastic job as Norman Bates. During the entire film he has this nervousness about him that is so believable. Even at the end of the film, he sits there with this blank stare, yet it portrays a lot of emotion. The use of light and shadows was done beautifully. Obviously the famous shower seen is hard to forget, but few remember the scene where ""mother"" kills the private detective. The way the camera zooms in on his face while he falls backwards down the stairs, making you feel like you are the killer.

Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho is one of those such films, a film that put paid to an entire era and mindset in American cinema; a film that defied grammar and construction and went all out in its deconstruction of both genre and issues of censorship.

563,27 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,9," Psycho not only shocked audiences, it defined the thriller genre.","I don't think there has ever been a film more referenced than Psycho. The musical score, the shower scene, the memorable characters...heck, it's even spawned a TV series. Essentially a young woman is responsible for cashing in $40,000 to her work's bank, but instead goes on the run. She stops by the Bates Motel for a rest, little did she know it would be her eternal resting place. An investigation arises into Norman Bates where certain ominous discoveries are made. This was completely unconventional back in 1960. To kill off the lead protagonist halfway through the film was bold. I'm talking massive kahunas. It was groundbreaking. Hitchcock had the audience right on his fingertips, like a puppeteer. His directing style was better than perfect. I've never seen such inventive camera techniques that clearly has influenced filmmakers today. The shower scene switching back and forth between the knife and Janet Leigh screaming, only to then watch the blood drain from the pristine bathtub. The slow panning as Vera Miles searches Bates' house, how every room concealed many secrets. Then the climax. The big reveal. Simply unforgettable. Hitchcock's natural talent of creating suspense and tension has yet to be exceeded. All performances were classy and felt natural. Leigh and Miles exhumed elegance. Balsam plays the private investigator with complete control. But Anthony Perkins...wow. His ability to switch from creepy psychopath to normal human was masterful. I couldn't take my offs of the screen. Finally that musical score evokes nightmares. Sharp, high pitched notes to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the film's entirety. Some of the thrills were inconsistent and the build up to these crescendos take slightly too long, but the characters are developed enough to prevent the build up from being boring. However, Psycho is an extremely well controlled thriller that not only defined the genre, but paved the way for the future of cinema. A must-see for any film buff.",
564,6 March 2021,CriticsVoiceVideo,3, Hogwash.,"I can't believe this movie is regarded as some brilliant cinema classic. It was going great until the last fifteen minutes, in which it became absolutely ridiculous. It went from being hilarious and intriguing to downright fatuous. The murder scenes are completely cheesy and laughable. Her eye moved twice when she was dead. The monologue the psychiatrist gave at the end was embarrassing. I can see how in 1960 this would have been groundbreaking and shocking, however it does not stand the test of time. I give it a three for good acting.",
565,6 September 2001,BaronBl00d,10, Very Deserved of Such High Praise,"The story of the motel owner with a split personality is part of our American culture.  Everyone is familiar with the famous shower scene. Bernard Herrmann's score evokes memories and moods instantly.  Psycho is a film masterpiece.  It is a wonderfully chilly tale of sexual repression, of madness, of the effects that living alone can have on an individual, and finally on the rural aspects of horror in the life of rural America.  It is a cheaply made film, but accomplishes so much with so little.  The credit goes to a handful of people.  First and foremost in this group stands the master of suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock.  It is Hitchcock's best film in terms of utilizing the minimal for the most shocking scenes ever filmed. His shower scene is forever etched into the mindset of people all over the world.  When the film came out, people were afraid to take showers afterward for quite awhile.  The camera lens sets the pace for the film, and my favourite scene is Janet Leigh driving in the car.  Extremely well-shot scenes with a steady current of tension.  Hitchcock was ably assisted by all concerned.  Herrmann's score is awesome.  Joseph Stefano did a wonderful job adapting the wonderful novel by horror legend Robert Bloch.  The acting is first-rate.  Anthony Perkins did such a good job that he never could escape the role of Norman Bates.  Martin Balsam, Vera Miles, even John Gavin do credible jobs.  Janet Leigh is very good, and looks quite fetching and provocative in a black brassiere.  Watch for cameos by Simon Oakland(from The Night Stalker fame) and Ted Knight as a guard.  An incredible film in many ways - not least of which is the incredible legacy the film has acheived in our cultural panorama.",

And I have to say, it did not disappoint. The film is full of plot twists, with an ending that one does not expect. It is also filled with many Hitchcock like shots, being very dramatic and suspenseful. The score of the film adds to the over all horror and suspense feel that the audience gets while watching, and helps make the film the masterpiece that it is. Psycho has definitely been a reference for many horror films to follow, and will continue to do so. It is truly a masterpiece, and I would recommend it to anyone.",
567,29 March 2013,gwnightscream,8," ""Mother Knows Best!""","Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles and John Gavin star in Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 thriller based on the novel. This begins one afternoon in Phoenix, Arizona where we meet woman, Marion Crane (Leigh) and her boyfriend, Sam Loomis (Gavin). Marion is a bank teller who decides to take a great sum of money from a very important client & friend of her boss in order to help Sam pay his debts. She runs away and drives until she checks into an isolated motel owned by mild-mannered young man, Norman Bates (Perkins) who lives with his ill mother. After Norman confides in Marion, she's brutally murdered in her motel room. Miles plays her sister, Lila who eventually meets Sam and together they learn what she's done and try to find her. The answers lie in wait when they go to the Bates motel and discover the truth about Norman and his mother. This classic forever changed the way we take showers and has inspired many slasher films such as John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" where the kitchen knife, the name, Sam Loomis and Leigh's daughter, Jamie Lee Curtis were used to pay homage. It's definitely Hitchcock's signature film featuring a good cast & excellent score by Bernard Herrmann. I recommend this.",

In its gut sensation, Psycho fits better alongside shoestring noir like Detour than with Hitchcock's own chic Technicolor thrillers like Rear Window or Vertigo. In this way and in its starring use of Janet Leigh, Psycho is as much a companion piece with Touch of Evil as it is Hitchcock's arguably most socially pivotal film.",

I had no idea that she was dead and that Norman was actually Mother. I found it really cool that the conversation between Norman and ""Mother"" was heard from outside the manor. It gave the feel that there were two people talking to each other.
Seeing Norman in his mother's outfit actually gave me the creeps, but I love the fact that at the end of the movie, the psychiatrist explains that Norman has a split-personality, but the personality of mother is the most dominant side now.
I also love how the gore scenes were made for black and white pictures. if I remember correctly, most of those movies used chocolate syrup because it had the right consistency to use as fake blood.",

578,7 November 2020,AlecYager,10, Favorite 60's film,"This film by Alfred Hitchcock is at the top of the list for my all time favorite films of the 60's. In the beginning while Marion is on the run with the $40,000 and she is being followed by the police you can almost feel how she would feeling. She played off that part very well. When you're on the run like that and you're filled with guilt it just seems like everybody knows what you did and everybody is out to get you. I also love the transition from protagonist to protagonist after Bates commits the two murders. In the beginning you expect to be going on this long journey with Marion while she's on the run with the $40,000 but next thing you know you're 40 minutes into the movie and she's being stabbed to death in the shower. It leaves you thinking ""where does the movie really go from here?"" And then it transitions to the private detective's perspective of him investigating where she might have taken off with the money.... and then BOOM, he gets stabbed by bates and now the mystery continues. In all honesty I was not predicting either of these murders, and unpredictable events in movies are what make me keep my eyes glued to the screen. The best part is probably the ending where the psychiatrist is explaining how Bates is mentally ill with split personalities; one of those personalities being his mother. Overall this film is on the top of my leaderboard when it comes to favorites. 10/10",
579,13 November 2020,colinpsquires,9, We all go a little mad sometimes......,"As I begin writing this review I can't help but feel a subtle chill run down my back, this is a testament to Alfred Hitchcock's successful execution of such an unsettling story. Viewed by many as one of the greatest films ever made, there's no doubt in my mind as to why Psycho has such a legendary reputation. Released in 1960, Psycho opened the door for many films in the thriller/slasher/horror genre that would follow. Psycho indices you from beginning to end. Each scene has your heart racing increasingly faster as the film progresses and for a different reason each time. This film draws you in to one situations and then turns you around right into another before you can even realize. Hitchcock masterfully pieces this
unique story together. I felt Psycho came across as a very complete movie, captivating performances, appealing cinematography, an unsettling score, and just the ability to draw you in is all pretty remarkable. The score alone is enough to make to shutter a little and it is paired up with every scene perfectly. The shots Hitchcock provides have a way of putting the films situation into perspective for the audience. It makes you feel part of the story and takes you on an intensified journey of angst and curiosity. Psycho's performances were convincing all around, but the real gem of this cast is Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. Perkins performance is the backbone of Psycho, Norman Bates is a genuinely chilling character with a lot more too him than just simply being strange. The concept of Norman Bates and his mother adds to this films uniqueness and disturbing feel. 100% recommend, especially to horror/thriller fans who have been holding out.",

The movie is loosely based upon the novel by Robert Bloch and it was adapted by Joseph Stefano. Psycho made stars out of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins (sadly it also sent the two to typecasting hell in the process). Hitchcock proved that he could adapt to the changing styles of Hollywood and make a true horror classic. He wisely shot the movie in black and white (giving the film an even creepier aura)and used a lot of great camera angles and trick photography. Anthony Perkins is very effective as Norman Bates, a young man who's life has been ruined by his overbearing mother.

The private eye who usually solves these kind of mysteries gets slashed. The mismatched couple who solves the mystery are unlikable characters. The most identifiable and sympathetic character in the film is Norman Bates. In the final twist this boy-next-door turns out to be a sexually deranged serial killer. His creepy close up in the end scene shows him talking to himself in self-delusion. The greatest terror of all is that nice Norman Bates is insane.

589,4 March 2014,jacobclark512,10, The Perfect Horror Film,"Psycho is a ""less is more"" type of film. The minimal budget allotted to Hitchcock made him simpler and more restrained in his film-making. This allowed the story and acting to shine through instead of the big names and huge flair of earlier films like North by Northwest. Janet Leigh is stunning as Marion Crane and ensures that we remember what little screen time she has. The rest of the supporting cast is memorable to a point and adds emotional depth to the story; however, it is Anthony Perkins who steals the show. His performance as Norman Bates is one of the most stunning performances of all time. Perkins also hides the film's twist well throughout the entire movie, adding to Psycho's suspense. The score by Bernard Herrmann is excellent and adds incredibly to the suspense, especially during the infamous shower scene. That single scene is perhaps the defining scene of Hitchcock's career. It not only serves as the single catalyst for the plot, it also shows the attention to detail he gave to his movies. Psycho is the best horror film ever made for its reliability on every other factor besides gore to create suspense. It revolutionized the genre, along with Hitchcock's career, to be more focused on substance rather than style.",

It was way ahead of its time and continues to impress today. This is where the term Hitchcockian came from to describe these psychological horror films that have been inspired by the great Hitchcock. It's been over 50 years since Hitchcock directed this film, and horror directors are still trying to imitate what he did. One of the things I enjoyed the most about this film is the way that Hitch fooled us all into thinking that it was going to be about Janet Leigh's character and ended up killing her off in the first half of the movie. I hadn't seen this film before, but had seen the famous shower scene thousands of times before. It's amongst the greatest scenes in film history considering the way Hitch filmed every shot taking the audience by surprise. I always thought that scene was the final one, so I was surprised to see it only 40 minutes into the movie. From that moment on I was sold and on board with what other unexpected turn the movie was going to make. Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman Bates was the highlight of the movie for me. He was excellent in his role and I was surprised he didn't get much credit for it. I think he was much better than the rest of the cast. I also imagine what a surprise the ending must have been for most people during the time since it was something totally unprecedented. I did see it coming now of course since so many films have copied the format, but I can only imagine the initial reaction. Psycho was also the perfect title for the film.",

And it is hard to do a better tormented crazy than Anthony Perkins. But I am not at all sure that this film has aged well. Some of Hitchcock's iconic visual images, such as the camera looking into the shower head, and the camera following the detectives face in tight as he is falling down the stairs, are still being copied today. But there is so much ""arty"" direction today that it badly distracts from the films. And that sort of blows back on Psycho. Still a classic nonetheless.",

Janet Lee plays a woman who decides to steal a large sum of cash and escape with it. The problem is she stops off to stay at the Bates Hotel overnight(which was definitely a mistake) and runs into the Bates family -- or at least it appears this way. Anthony Perkins is excellent as the disturbed son of the messed up family who covers up for his supposed mother's mistakes in the true good son fashion. The mystery behind the movie is determining who did the evils to Janet and others in the Bates Hotel. Hitchcock brilliantly keeps us guessing til the end as well as providing the shocks that we expect from the movie. This is the ultimate weird family scary movie that others have tried to imitate(some well and some badly), but they never match the excellent direction done by the master storyteller. There is the much imitated shower scene, but the overall movie in general is well written and put together and the one scene shouldn't make the entire movie(which it doesn't here).

599,2 April 2013,SuperDuperMCA,8, OG horror,Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is a god tier horror movie and I'd say its probably the best example of classic horror. The story has at this point been told and remixed 1000 different ways over the years but because of Alfred's understanding of human fear and his incredible skill as a director no other film maker can come close to creating as captivating of a psychopath as the infamous Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). I love the symbolism in the very last scene where Norman sits alone in the chair and claims he'd never hurt a fly. Very clever and unorthodox camera angles keep the viewer on the edge of their seat while watching this film especially during the scenes where Norman attacks his victims and the famous shrieking sound effect begins to play. If you have never seen this movie and enjoy horror movies it is definitely worth watching. Even though compared to current film it may seem dated because of the lack of special effects and computer animation the rawness and great use of music and sound effects by Hitchcock make this slasher flick stand the test of time.,

Alfred Hitchcock's directing is at its best in this film. I only need to mention the shower scene and the final shot of the movie to prove my point. Psycho sets a creepy and often unsettling atmosphere throughout the movie and Alfred Hitchcock shows the audience that he is in full control of his craft. Psycho can feel slow at times but it is definitely worth it and just adds to the tension of the film. Anthony Perkins gives the performance of his career as the now legendary character of Norman Bates as well as Janet Leigh as Marion Crane.

The movie contains a great sequel 22 years later that holds up just as good as the first. You will feel like this was the first real horror movie ever made (although it's actually not) This truly is a timeless classic. If your a horror fan or even just a movie fan in general you must watch this, you want regret it.",

The movie unfolds at a pace which is perfect according to modern standards. It is a guarantee you'll be spiked on your seats for the entire length of the movie. The acting is outclass with special reference being to Anthony Perkins, the stammering motel manager and of course Vera Miles (also John Gavins acting for me). Hitchcock brings out his best direction techniques and methods in this movie. Everything about this movie just stands out, its cinematography, acting, direction, story telling.. just everything. The plot, though simple, is created with so much suspense that you'll be submerged into the movie. The climax may well be the best we have ever seen (not even comparable to climax in The Usual Suspects). For the climax alone i would rank the movie 10/10. This is one horror/mystery movie that revolutionized the way mystery movies were made. All assured, Vera Miles' screaming picture would be etched in your mind for a long time. A definite watch.",

You could believe, no, wait, you HAD to believe every word Norman said, until you find out his terrible secret, even if you'd seen it before, or known the truth (like I had). It was, however, a shame to know that the final shot of Norman probably sealed Anthony Perkins' fate of being type-cast as Norman Bates forever, he did that good of a job. Janet Leigh was also incredible, as were Vera Miles, John Gavin, and Martin Balsam. Even if they only had three lines, anyone in this flick made it what it is.

616,3 August 2014,Seraphion,6, A classic thriller with probably the best twist at its time,"Although the background conflict drive is introduced very early in the beginning, the story took quite a long time to build up until the first real conflict occurs. And it takes up to about half an hour to reach the real focus of the movie. The thriller aspect is kept very nicely using the conversation dialog with the camera shooting elsewhere or at outside of the conversation's room. The conflict's final climax is indeed a great twist. It may even be one of the best twists of its time. I like how the movie retains focus after the the character that has been the sole focus of the movie is depicted dead. The acting is just a decent one. What's quite irritating to me is that most of the male actors try very hard to have the fake commanding accent. Janet Leigh acted nice enough, though. She handled her gestures nice in making the conversations more alive.",

642,11 August 2015,brchthethird,9," ""A boy's best friend is his mother.""","SPOILER ALERT: Norman Bates committed the murders. PSYCHO has been around for over 50 years, and if you haven't seen it by now it's your own fault. Of course, it's been several years since I first saw it and, going through a Hitchcock marathon, I thought it would be an appropriate time to revisit it. My only memories of seeing it the first time are wondering what the big deal was. However, now having seen many films since then (including several more Hitchcock pictures), it seems even better to me the second time around. This is in large part thanks to the Bernard Herrmann's score, which punctuates all the right moments and backs off when necessary. The first thing other than the main theme that people will probably think of is the celebrated shower scene, but this time the moments where the score takes a back seat, or goes away entirely, stood out more. In particular, the scene where Norman and Marion have dinner in his parlor came off as extremely creepy, and the way in which Norman's demeanor changes within that scene was nothing short of amazing. Also, in contrast to NORTH BY NORTHWEST, PSYCHO has a rear-projected driving scene which actually worked for me. Again, a lot of this has to do with the score, but Janet Leigh's facial expressions and reactions to what goes on around her helped just as much to make it work. What also makes this film stand out from a lot of Hitchcock's other pictures was the conscious artistic choice to shoot in black and white. Although he said it would have been too gory to shoot in color, it gives the film a distinct griminess that stands in contrast to the high glamour of his other work. PSYCHO is decidedly unglamorous, and it succeeds because it fits with the subject matter. Lastly, Hitchcock is notorious for playing with audience expectations, and PSYCHO contains perhaps his greatest cinematic joke: the (apparent heroine) is killed off nearly halfway in to the film. Now her death does provide the dramatic momentum for the rest of it, but I can only imagine how audiences 1960 would have been shocked by this twist. In terms of his overall corpus (at least what I've seen so far), I'd put it up there with REAR WINDOW and NORTH BY NORTHWEST just shy of VERTIGO. The only thing that brings it down a peg is some needless psychoanalysis in the last scene. For me, it would have been more powerful to cut most of that out and skip to the chilling final shot that gradually zooms in on Anthony Perkins' face. Still, even with that scene, PSYCHO is definitely one of Hitchcock's finest, and laid the groundwork for the next generation of horror films.",

The basic problem with any suspense film is the audience can be secure in the knowledge that the big-name star will survive the film--somehow. Psycho breaks this tradition and throws the audience a completely unexpected curve. Psycho also demonstrates what a good director can do with a low budget and, basically, a one-set picture.  Good performances all around, particularly from Perkins. Nearly a perfect piece of cinema, marred only by occasionally sloppy editing and a few unfair red herrings, such as using an actress (Virginia Gregg) as the voice of ""mother"" instead of having Perkins do it. Brilliant Bernard Herrmann score uses only strings. Title sequences by Saul Bass seamlessly set-up the story.

It is Hitchcock's greatest use of montage - each cut as an assault on the audience's senses, each as another slash of the knife to Crane's dripping, screaming face. Eisenstein's theory means we do not actually see knife ever puncture flesh, but the separate images creates a merged meaning. And would it be half as iconic without Bernard Herrmann's contribution? The screeching strings are built up apprehensively before the pivotal scene, and when they finally match up with the knife, it slips in seamlessly with each slash, each cut, and it is frantic, horrifying.

His other nominated films as a director were Rear window, spellbound, Life Boat and Rebecca. He never won the Oscar. This time around he lost out to Billy Wilder for The Apartment. What he accomplished from this innovative low budget film probably should have won him the Oscar. This is a low budget film for Hitchcock that in toady;s dollars would have cost about $5 million to make. The film was adapted from the 1959 lackluster novel by Robert Bloch by screenwriter Joseph Stefano. Cinematographer Jack Russell got an Academy Award nomination for photographing this film but no major film offers because of his work, He had did Orson Welles' Macbethe early in his career and was mostly involved in television and a few B movies before and after Psycho. He does a great job here along with film editor George Tomasini who edited Stalag 17, Vertigo, North By Northwest, The Birds and Cape Fear among his many fine films. A memorable music score from Bernard Herrman who did such films as Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, The Day The Earth Stood Still, Vertigo and The Man Who Knew Too Much. This is the story of a woman who steals $40,000 dollars and has plans to run away with her married lover but sees her plans and the life she lived evaporate so on the run she stops at a rundown motel off the beaten path that sits in the shadow of an old decapitated wooden turn-of-the-century mansion where the motel keeper lives with his aged mother. It's a classic horror setting and filmed in black and white. Janet Leigh in an Academy award nominated performance as Best Supporting Actress is the woman on the run and Anthony Perkins is the motel keeper who has been hounded by his domineering mother all his life and functions in his lonely existence as a motel keeper of a motel that no one stops at anymore. Also among the cast are Martin Balsam, Vera Miles, John Gavin and John McIntire. This film also received an Oscar nomination for Best Art Direction for it's great set. It's a fairly simple story with twists and turns and a little black comedy thrown in. It's a classic and comes across as kind of a bonus prize for followers of Hitchcock like he was saying here's something a little different for you to check out. I would give it a 9.0 out of 10.",

Along the way, he also creates a couple of Hollywood icons, when he introduces the world to Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Hitchcock always was a man who wanted to do things differently from what other directors did. He always said, that great storytelling comes from showing the audience what will happen. If there is a bomb under the table, then show the audience the bomb. He wasn't afraid to take chances doing things to his main characters, that were unconventional in modern film of the time, in order to draw the most shock from the audience. In the case of Psycho (1960), he delivers that with a punch.",

There have been many changes to the genre over the last couple of decades, perhaps the most significant when the genre went digital with the psychologically frightening Blair Witch Project.

Perkins makes his best job in this movie. Norman Bates is a legend. A lot of people did not see Psycho but everybody knows who is Norman Bates. The movie has a lot of symbols and the music is the best. Hitch confirms in this movie that good actors and good staff is enough to make a good movie. North by Northwest was excellent, but it cost 3 or 4 times more than Psycho. It is more than a cult film. Psycho is really a masterpiece. Psycho is a movie that you can watch 20 times and every time that you see it, found new elements. Is full of details. The subliminal presence of the mother figure is present in all the movie. The color of the under ware of Marion changes to black after she left the town trying to express that she feels dirty. And the scene of the bath... is maybe the most famous scene in the history... is difficult to perceive after that yo never saw a naked body and never so a knife inside of the victim. But during the sequence you're sure that it is happening. Psycho is magic... is a lesson to everyone who loves movies. I think that is necessary to watch this movie before to comment another one.",

Almost too weird to be true, Bloch sensationalized the original story and created a top notch horror story which became a movie that started a whole new series of slasher and killer movies. Psycho is a masterpeice in direction, style, acting, writing, plot and execution. The story centers around that of a lovely, would-be female thief who absconds with a lot of money. The movies rotates around the movie's main character like a pin wheel before shooting in and absolving the story with a climax and one of the single most recognizable visuals in movie history. Anthony Perkins is a vulnerable but likeable maniac with a character, a far cry from his hockey masked and claw handed progeny. Janet Leigh proves how the shower is the most vulnerable spot for a person to be, and Martin Balsam creates a believable detective far from the trench coat gumshoes in the old nickel and dime stories.

She IS kind of weird. But, it can't be that nice man who runs the motel. He's awkward with women and ""devoted"" to his invalid mother. Then, when Mother kills Marion in the shower, Norman cleans up and covers up, like a dutiful son. We'll have to cart IL' Mom off to the Looney Bin mighty soon! She's PSYCHO!! I was absolutely surprised (I was only a boy of 19) when the real psycho-killer-mad-slasher was exposed.

This film is the master of suspense with some great camera angles. Mr. Bates ascending and descending the staircase in the empty, creepy house with the body of his mother heightens the horrors. It is easy to put oneself in the place of the characters. This film will keep one engaged with the constant action and the mystery. There's even a little element of humour and disgust.

Yes I enjoyed it very much and I was thinking the whole way through. Anthony Perkins plays the role of Norman great, his friendly smiles, his comments his speeches ""We all go a little mad sometimes"") and just his general acting, the way he walked and moved.

She stops off during a stormy night for a stay at the Bates Motel, run by Norman Bates. She gets into the shower in her room, but never comes out. Janet's family come looking for her, questioning all the places in the area, and they are curious about the Bates motel, for Norman isn't normal, and his loveable mother who sits in the house behind the hotel, isn't so loveable either.

690,17 June 2004,davidbyrne77,10," The best, bar none","If you're reading this, chances are you've seen the film - so there is little point describing the plot.  Okay.  Why do I keep revisiting this film, and why do I hold it to such a high regard?  Two words - acting and directing.  If this is the first 'real' horror movie, or the first slasher film, it is the best because it doesn't fall into the traps associated with later (and cheesier) horror films.  For one, all of the characters are 'real' and intelligent.  Sure, Norman Bates is weird, and Marion Crane is scared of him, but she's also sympathetic to his plight.  It isn't like he's waving around butcher knives and she says, ""Hmm, well, I think I'll go take a shower now!""  The conversation in Norman's parlour ends on a pleasant note (after having navigated through some very dark material) and she leaves to go prepare for bed - she couldn't have suspected what was about to happen or the audience would have suspected it too - the killing wouldn't have been a shock at all. Another thing about these 'real' characters.  Arbogast starts out hard-boiled, but his conversatin with Norman in the motel office seems so real to the point where I suspect that the dialogue was ad-libbed.  But of course Hitchcock wouldn't have allowed that.  But the dialogue doesn't sound scripted at all.  It's all in the delivery - very effective, we get to see that Arbogast is very good at his job - not an amateur at all.  When Sam and Lila go to the motel to do their own investigation, there is inspired dialogue that you wouldn't hear in a conventional horror film.  For one thing, when they enter the bathroom, the scene of the earlier carnage, Sam matter-of-factly remarks ""there's no shower curtain"".  It's just a coment, and neither character dwells on this miniscule of details - how could they have guessed that it was used to wrap Marion's body with before she was dumped in her car trunk?  As well, when Sam decides to occupy Norman while Lila searches the house, he says ""If you find anything, anything at all, don't stop to tell me"".  See?  Again, this wouldn't have occurred in a regular movie. The characters are intelligent and think out their actions before they act on them.  And while Lila is put in the position of choosing to either run out the back door of Norman's house or down the flight of stairs and into the basement, she chooses the stairs (famous horror movie mistake) not because she is stupid, but because she is curious and wants nothing else but to find out what happened to her sister. It's one thing to have a main character massacred halfway through the film, but it's a much different movie that show's the intricate clean up of the crime scene - the mopping up of the blood, the wiping of the floor, walls and bathtub, the careful disposal of the body, etc, etc.  While the murder last for less than 30 seconds, the clean up goes on for 10 minutes, and makes the scene far, FAR more disturbing.  Watching dutiful Norman clean up his 'Mother's' mess, looking at the blood on his hands, smiling happily as the car sinks below the surface of his backyard swamp...well, it reaches a level of 'disturbing' that most movies hope to achieve but never reach. And the last line:  ""Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly....""  Enough said.",

Considered a horror icon, it excels in both cinematic tension as well as sheer terror. It accomplishes this through a variety of techniques, such as composer Bernard Herrmann's chilling score, or the ominous low-key lighting of John L. Russell's cinematography. Consider in itself the mise en scene of the creepy Bates Motel itself. But an important factor that some might overlook would be the editing, done by George Tomasini.

This movie isn't overrated and its reputation isn't exaggerated. It truly is excellence if you've ever seen it on the silver screen. The utilization of the protagonists is unique and makes for a standout dynamic in this film, while at the end the twist is truly completely unexpected. And I'm saying this now at a time when we've seen it all in every possible way, so at the time this was just light-years ahead of its cinematic period all things considered. All actors play their part just fine and help establish at each moment, along with the excellent cinematography (all in subtlety and allusion) and soundtrack, a particular feel, or a specific lingering emotion. It's really very well done, and some parts are just spot-on like it is rare in film. But Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates just steals the show here amongst the cast. In this film, there is an unsettling weirdness that oozes out of him, and it is never overdone, nor is it ever unremarkable. It's just...just right. Moreover, the plot revolves around a fairly common, and very real occurrence: the Oedipus complex. And it's so well carried out throughout the film, and never gives in to over-exaggeration although it would remain of course a very extreme case. But never does this turn into overdramatic cheesy 60's horror cinema, and the tensions are handled perfectly, as always with Hitchcock, cleverly and meticulously. The only criticism I would give this is the too obvious explanation at the end and overall that ultimate elaboration scene just isn't realistic, in regards to a few things.

711,16 November 2020,eawelkley,10, Anthony Perkins: Robbed of Recognition,"There's something rather fitting about the first Alfred Hitchcock film I've seen being one of his most famous. Unfortunately, thanks to pop culture having referenced the now famous shower scene in Psycho, I was already aware of the 'twist' early in the film that shocked audiences of the day, so a fair bit of the impact that Hitchcock had intended to create is lost on me. It is a shame that I can't experience this fantastic film with fresh eyes from 1960, but I would love to have the opportunity. However, the film's score is extremely effective at being unnerving and distinct from almost any other movie I've seen. Using only string instruments as a budget restraint proved to be beneficial to the tone of the movie. The same reasoning also applies to the decision to film in black and white, which may be a point against it to some people, but not me. Also impressive was Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman Bates. He truly gives off the impression of a man completely unhinged, from his occasional stuttering, to the numerous physical things he does like the subtle twitching, and the completely deranged expressions he puts on. I can imagine why he reprised his role for every subsequent Psycho sequel movie, even though I haven't seen them. Definitely worth a watch today, even if some of the more intense moments may have lost their impact over the course of time.",

Many other good films to be sure, such as Vertigo, N/NW, Strangers on a Train, Rear Window, Shadow of a Doubt, The Man Who Knew Too Much (34), 39 Steps, Frenzy, but this one has the most impact for me.

I understand that this have a lot of spoilers and I know all of them. I find this less violent and more sexual base on the content shown in the film. Even worst, this is 1960 and it looks quite wrong to me. This film might be quite horrible and even scary for young children, so parents should watch out before watching this film in the first place due to violence and sexual content, mostly the sexual content.

718,16 July 1999,Movieman-133,1," Psycho, The most overrated horror.. NO suspense movie of all time.","Well,   what can I say about this film.   It's merely okay and the black and white makes the film seem completely dull and frankly quite boring.  I don't understand what all this talk about the color being artistic but I found it repulsive.   The acting in the movie was very mediocre, especially from the stiff John Gavin,   the ever so proper Vera Miles,  and the so serious Martin Balsam.   Try watching the new Psycho and you'll find that these characters can actually have personalities. As for Janet Leigh, well she was good,   but Anne Heche seemed more innocent,  more human,  and more sympathetic.   As for Anthony Perkins,    he's also so monotone, barely ANY emotion,   and I struggle to understand why people rave over his dry performance.  As for the ""mother twist"",  well that was good but there are twists in about every horror film now a days and they are usually more entertaining than this joke. And then there is the shower scene which everyone says is so scary?  Where have they been ,  I could pick out a dream sequence from any A Nightmare on Elm Street sequel that was done more creatively and powerfully.  It was a simple knifing in the shower for god's sake,   isn't watching the opening of Drew Barrymore in Scream ten times more chilling and exciting? Give me a break,  when I went to Universal Studious they said the shower sequence was one of the most famous scenes of all time.  Well,  give an audience an opportunity to watch either that or the astonishing death of Piper Laurie in Depalma's Carrie,  or the thrill of the finale chase in Halloween,  and well see what brings more reactionary emotion of the audience.  Well,  what can I say about a movie that I will never understand?  When people made the new Psycho some thought it was stupid because of the story--and so I know I'm not alone.   It's just that these old foggies are so hung up on old movies that they are blind to see that modern movies provide for much more entertainment.    Some old horror films like Rosemary's Baby are excellent,  but this is not.  As for Bernard Herrmann score,   it's overplayed,   can't he think of anything new to compose? Compare Pino Donnagio' lush score from Carrie opposed to this and see what's more creative and effective.  What can I say besides people, this movie is simply average and that it might of have been good back then, but it's simply OK now.  Do we still rave about the type writer just because it was original back then?  I have spoken and I guess that Blockbuster Video agrees with me that the movie is too much of a joke to be placed in the horror section.  It's in the Drama suspense category,  and certainly a thrilless and dated film to belong anywhere else.  Psycho remains as the most overrated film of all time and the new Psycho is a much better improvement.",
719,27 December 2000,grandmalop911,10, A classic if there ever was one.,"As much as I like the 1998 remake it was very unnecessary in my opinion. Why remake something that is already perfected? Psycho is probably the best horror movie this world will ever see. I think the fact that it's in black and white actually adds to the suspense of it all. Most of the movies from the 60's have faded with time and aren't spoken of much anymore but psycho even before the remake is still very remembered, very fresh in our heads, and still held in the very highest respects. (and thats not the only one of Hitchcock's movies that is.) I will always love the famous shower scene and always think about when I'm home alone in the shower and hear a noise. Not every movie has a scene in it that can live in your head like that. One of the ideas in this movie that i particularly like is how Marion was going to go back and fix what she had done wrong in the morning but it was too late. No one would have ever known after that that she was sorry and she was going to bring the money back it just brings up and interesting point. I wish todays horror movies were this good.",

The themes can be talked about over and over, but it is the build up of suspense, coupled with Perkins's performance which keeps it fresh today. Perhaps not jumpy enough for some, although there are plenty of those moments, the film relies on the director's knowledge of the viewer: we are in his hands.

750,19 May 2010,ilpohirvonen,10, Mundane Freudian Horror from This World,"At the age of 60, Alfred Hitchcock decided to go wildly radical after his award-winning big productions. His next film, Psycho (1960), was an independent production whose budget was only 800 000 dollars. Through this Hitchcock was able to make a film, entirely in a way he wanted to but also achieve a naturally mundane atmosphere which was still characterized by psychological and film noir-like elements. Psycho is still Hitchcock's most shocking film and the most influential film he ever made. Just like The Beatles, the death of Elvis and the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so is Psycho a part of the cultural legacy of the 1960's. It marked a turning point in the history of American cinema and changed its being forever: reality was now approached in a brand new way, through a Hitchcockian prism of fear. ",

The music is classic and extremely recognizable. Interesting fact: Janet Leigh (Marion Crane) was originally discouraged by friends and family about taking the role of Marion Crane, saying that because she died the role wouldn't be good for her.

Her run ends up at the Bates Motel where she meets Norman (Anthony Perkins) and his sick mother. All of a sudden she is smashed to death in the famous shower scene, no more than 40 minutes after that start. Then we realize we have entered in a completely different kind of movie: a sordid Thriller with a surprising ""finale"" much like a horror film. Hitchcock carries the picture perfectly and it makes complete sense at the end. Back in 1960 double personality movies where not common and many appeared after Psycho (Dressed to Kill, as the outstanding example),but none could get even close to the original. Interest is kept all along and the music score is perfect too. As for the cast, it could not be better. Leigh proved for the first time she could really act and did well after Psycho. Vera Miles also grew as an actress after Psycho, and John Gavin was correct (unusual in him). John McIntyre and Martin Balsam make great supporting. As for Perkins there can be no doubt this was his best performance ever; in fact, you could say the film ruined his carrier because whenever you saw him after Psycho you could not help see Norman Bates. But on the other side, the role put him forever in films history. Saying that Psycho is Hitchcok's best picture shows clearly the huge size of this movie coming from a guy that made such classics as Rear Window, Dial M for Murder, North by Northwest and many others.

I gave this movie a 10 with a very clear and unbiased viewing.  So believe me when I say: this movie is very best of its field.  The scenes are amazing, everything must have been very intricately imagined by Hitchcock because everything had maximum effect.  Mr. Hitchcock very brilliantly considered all aspects of the movie, even the fact that he had it shot in black and white meshes together so very well.  The villaian is so believable you can almost taste his sweat and franticness.  So are the victims, you can taste their pain.  The murder scene in the shower is the BEST murder scene I have ever seen in my life.  And believe me, I have seen loads of movies to choose from.  The murder scene made Argento's murder scenes look like Sesame Street.  There was an editing of a scene which showed nudity, many people complained about this but I salute the MPAA for cutting out the nudity scene.  This movie is pure, it does not need even a flash of nudity.  I want you all to understand one thing, recently they remade this movie with a newer cast, more money, color, etc. and they could still not come close to touching the power Psycho had.

It's a masterclass in subtle horror, were Anthony Perkins is far and beyond the star. When his story starts to crumble, he starts to stutter. The music score is intense, and I guess a bunch of violin strings broke, with the agressive use. It's NOT my favorite Hitchcock, but it's a must see as a classic. Although I always wondered how Janet Leigh could HEAR mother all the way from the house to the motel... a small detail, but Hitch was a control freak. The ending was so pitch perfect, although a bit overexplained (guess schizophrenia wasnt common knowledge in 1960). Oh well, Norman IS mother. Btw, notice the murder of Martin Balsam.

766,29 October 2007,xander34,7, Works because of the performances,"Reviewing Alfred Hitchcock's famed black and white opus Psycho from a 21st century perspective gives the film less credit than it deserves. For it's time, it was revolutionary. Now, it is just a well acted, yet somewhat dated horror film. The editing in the shower scene has become a cliché in pop culture, but one cannot deny the original brilliance of the scene. The movie really only works as well as it does because of the performances of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins. Perkins never really had another role he was better in, save Mike Nichols' Catch-22, a personal favorite. After Hitchcock died, he later starred and directed in numerous Psycho sequels before Perkins' eventual death. Hitchcock's killing of Leigh at the onset is also quite ground-breaking. It was mirrored in Wes Craven's Scream with the Drew Barrymore character, as well as in many other pictures.",

Janet Leigh (who is a much better actress than her daughter) was a great choice for her character. On the other hand, I really hated the whiny girl they cast as her sister. What made psycho work as a thriller/ horror phenonemon was the way it was marketed..because, let's face it--the shower scene isn't THAT scary.

The film is a masterpiece complete with suspense, terror and a fantastic tale of a lonely young man living in the big creepy house behind the motel. The cast is phenomenal and all-star with Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, the lonely young man (he is quite cute), Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, a woman who stole $40,000 from a rich client, Vera Miles as Lila Crane, Marion's sister and John Gavin as Sam Loomis, Marion's lover. Any horror fan should see this film or they cannot be deemed real horror genre fans.",

Perkins gives the best performance of his career as Bates, the villain of the century. Psycho scares us from the beginning and scares us at the end as well. It may be Hitchcock's scariest movie, if not his all-time best. The score is legendary, the filmmaking is powerful, and the acting is incredible.

Hitchcock's Psycho was released in 1960, before most of today's cinema patrons were born, and today it is not often seen either in the few remaining repertory cinemas or even on TV movie channels. Younger viewers will never be able to experience the shock that this film created when first released. Seeing it on a home DVD can give no hint of its original impact in the theatre. In principle one might expect that by now this film would be nothing more than a fading memory for most of today's movie goers, but instead new comments on it are being submitted to IMDb on an ongoing basis and major film reviewers also continue to discuss it in numerous other publications. Such facts probably tell us all that we need to know about Psycho; but, even if they do not, there can be very little left to say to add to the 511 comments already published by IMDb.",

But besides that and the good directing, it totally lacks of brilliance. The actors were OK, but not worthy of all the praise they were given for it... Just take a look at what they have achieved in life: Anthony Perkins: 1 Oscar nomination (for supporting role), Janet Leigh: 1 Oscar nomination (for Psycho, which tells us a lot), and I won't even mention Vera Miles simply because there is nothing to mention. These are no great actors, not in any other movies, and neither in Psycho. Then we come to the story, the part of the film I really did not like. There's simply nothing brilliant about it, it's merely a plain story. Also, it was a little too obvious, referring to the fact that Norman's mother was already dead. This should have been worked out better, just like the shower scene. OK, the idea was brilliant, but I just can't believe, even back in 1960, that people find this shocking. It was such a let-down, I had expected so much more of this scene... It really looked like a big comedy. I know that many of the Psycho fans will disagree with my opinion, but let me just quote Hitchcock to add force to my opinion: ""To me Psycho was a big comedy. Had to be."" Then I wondered, how come it still has become a classic? Well, allow me to again quote Hitchcock: ""Even my failures make money and become classics a year after I make them.""",

This movie delivers tension like no other. The famous shower scene gets me every time I choose to watch the film(Psycho). When ya first saw you didn't see it coming. But then when you saw it again, you anticipate in dread. So it's got REPLAY VALUE. Excellent photograpy and camera work. The house on the hill sure is spooky. And the ending scared the crap out of me when I was little. I still does. It's such a disturbing looking skeleton. It looks like an ape for crying out loud! Gee whiz. It sure is a great flick.

788,22 August 2020,heverett-10426,10, Classic Hitchcock Horror Film,"Psycho, directed by Alfred Hitchcock remains one of the most influential horror movies of all time. Every single slasher movie that followed owes a huge debt to Psycho. Apart from pioneering the genre, Psycho is my favorite horror movie of all time. The plot is very unpredictable. In the first third of the movie, Janet Leigh is introduced as the typical Hitchcock protagonist; an average person pulled into the world of crime. We are led to believe that the movie will revolve around the $40,000 she stole from her boss. However, around the halfway mark, Hitchcock subverts our expectations and kills off Leigh in the now legendary shower scene. The unexpectedness of the scene. the quick editing and the shrill Bernard Herrmann score are what make this scene so effective. As for the $40,000, Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins, disposes of it while cleaning up the body. This brings me to another great part of the movie, Anthony Perkins' character. He plays his character as a shy, dutiful mama's boy trapped by his authoritarian mother. We genuinely believe that he is just a dutiful son cleaning up after his psychotic mother till the end. The final twist is a great example of Hitchcock's control over his audience. Due to his expert direction and Perkins' performance, we fail to see the obvious. Easily one of Hitchcock's greatest films.",
789,22 October 2006,karl_consiglio,10, Flawless,"A groundbreaking film from beginning to end even by today's standards. Psycho has been reviewed over and over in Film schools and Universities and with very good reason. Alfred Hitchcock was a savage stuffed bird genius. He was so very inventive, courageously creative and true to his cause. He was so ahead of his time. Psycho has no clichés, on the contrary it broke boundaries and crushed all sorts of taboos in film making. Apart from shocking this film must have been downright scandalous too. This film is great from all angles. Starts with Janet Leigh fleeing the city with the stolen cash like an escaped canary to freedom or the unknown dangers outside. Hitchcock was obsessed with birds and totally inspired by them, yes hence the movie 'The Birds'. The suspense in Psycho is superb. We are constantly at the edge of our seats and what comes to us is way beyond our expectations and imagination. Anthony Perkins was perfect for the role which was to follow him for the rest of his days. He even had the right shape for this part and that is were I think they failed the most in trying to remake this film, it was a small but very effective detail, they did not take into consideration the shape of this man Hitchcock had chosen. Hitchcock was also the first as far as I know to ever slash our starring attractive blonde actress to pieces in the middle of the movie and sending the film off into another direction with our suspense at its peak. The shower scene is an all time classic that must have downright shocked the audience at the time because even watching it today will keep you with it imprinted in your memory forever, no matter what we are used to seeing on our screens today. The irony in those shots is that as they were being shot Hitchcock is going ""cut"" ""cut"" ""cut"".....That knife is the beak of a bird of prey. Metaphorically there are birds everywhere in this film as in most of his work. The mother is a stuffed bird.",
790,13 April 2014,saytosandeep,8, MY REVIEW: Welcome to the World of Alfred Hitchcock!!,"Psycho. It has been more than 50 years now when this Hitchocokian piece of amazing cinematic experience was first shown to the world and it has not dated at all. A chilling story, watertight screenplay, detailed narration, solid acting, subtle conversations and on top of it the magical touch of Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock did not need gore or violence to spook you, he did it with just creating the creepy atmosphere and giving you scares at the right moments. Janet Leigh as the victim of its own actions and Anthony Perkins as the mysterious guy give you chills now and then. There is hardly any unwanted scene and Hitchcock makes you root for all characters including the evil ones. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Psycho. This is my first triumph with Alfred Hitchcock's old world of black and white gems and I am sure I am going to dive deeper and deeper.",

It's essential for a whole genre, as iconic and unmistakable as Boris Karloff's Frankenstein monster in Jack Pierce's make-up and will be for many more generations to come. As far as horror movies go it can't get any better than this. Anthony Perkins remains stuck in your mind due to his nervously shy performance throughout most of the film, likable and odd at the same time, and the ice cold twist at the end makes perfect sense.",

793,14 January 2021,blueginkoh,9, A Masterclass in Suspense,"Hitchcock has always been credited for his ability to create incredibly suspenseful scenes in his films, and Psycho is a great example of this.
Utilizing close ups that make the viewer feel boxed in, uncommon lighting scenarios that accentuate subtle features of the face to just slightly distort them and give off the uneasy feeling of looking at something familiar and yet unfamiliar, and some excellent framing and blocking, Hitchcock creates a timeless thriller masterpiece that had me absolutely hooked.
Perkins' performance as Norman Bates is amazing as well; he creates this unsettling air about him that is noticeable immediately upon first meeting him.
Of course, there is also the famous bathtub drain to eye transition in this film, which has to be mentioned as one of the best match cuts in cinema history.",

799,13 November 2015,gck-31751,10, A cleverly made psychological thriller film which can take audience wherever Hitchcock wants.,"First of all I was disappointed to see the movie in B&W. But, after watching the movie I can clearly understand why Hitchcock had chosen B&W over colour. If you are also thinking like me, don't care about the colour just watch this.If you don't, you are just giving up on the ""mother"" of all modern horror movies. No movie lover will take a risk of not watching Psycho. The cinema begins normally, in Phoenix, Arizona. The lead actress was a worker in a real-estate service corporation. She stole $40,000, which she had to put in bank and decides to leave the city. When she was driving, there must be scenes at her office and home to be shown. All we expect was to see those but not the face of the actress, but Hitchcock made a remarkable history to just show what is really needed. This makes you realize the mastery of Hitchcock. A psychological thriller which people didn't see till 1960, remains unaltered in its image.This connects to our minds directly. Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins), the owner of Bates Motel and a Momma's boy looks like a friendly person. His action really brought the movie to life. An great movie which makes us predict what happens next, but deceives us every time in a HONEST way. Coming to the part which contributed majorly to the movie's success, MUSIC. Bernard Herrmann's score is quintessential. The music he gave makes the movie appealing at the most famous scene ""Shower Scene"". The most frightening scene is the out-of-nowhere murder of the Private Investigator. The music helped a lot here too. By continuously shocking the audience, Hitchcock took the movie in his direction, righteously. At the end, the audience will be shocked again and this is most horrifying too.",

801,24 July 2013,josephbrando,5, Overrated Slasher Relic!,"Psycho (and Alfred Hitchcock movies in general) is one of the most overrated films in cinematic history. First off this has nothing to do with any distaste for ""old"" or ""black and white"" movies, as I very rarely watch anything post-1980. But this movie is just really boring. Maybe it's because it is so iconic that any scenes that are supposed to be scary have been burned into pop culture, thereby dulling its power. The first half of the movie, while slow, held my interest enough but once the main character is killed off, I found the movie unbearable to sit through. Yes I understand that this film was a trendsetter as far as slasher flicks go, but I think a real good movie will draw in and hold its audience's interest just as much as time goes on - and Psycho does not! At least not mine. If its place in horror film history is really the only selling point for this flick then it really should be in a museum and not on your television. The Hammer Films, Friday the 13th, Halloween, Val Lewton's films, Black Sunday, The Exorcist - now those are movies that have stood the test of time and retained their entertainment value and fright factor. I give this five stars for the good camera work and Anthony Perkins, who really eats up his role.",
802,8 November 2008,Ibuk,10, The one that started it all,"When released in 1960 Psycho's impact on the horror genre was so great that 48 years later filmmakers still seem to be influenced.

When I watched it for the first time a couple of months I was worried that I wouldn't appreciate it seeing as the twist is widely known. Despite knowing the twist it was still shocking and I throughly enjoyed it. The scene in which they find out the truth about Norman Bates mother still disturbs me. The star of the movie has to be Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. His performance was outstanding, especially in the scene in which he almost shows his true colours. Psycho is a true gem and in my opinion has made a valuable contribution to the horror genre. Absolutely unmissable.",

In saying that, the film still delivers everything you would expect it to and more. It contains some of the most iconic imagery, characters and shocks ever put on screen.

Of course, she had reason to be, but something about these scenarios she played in her head while she was driving to Fairvale seemed unreal. Also, that cop that followed her to California was very unnerving. I sometimes wonder if that was real or a dream, or is Hitch leaving us to decide for ourselves if it is or not. Again, this scene seemed surreal. (That cop looked freaky. Like a commandant of a Nazi concentration camp or something.) Wasn't that Robert Stack who played the gentleman who sold her the car?

Unfortunately, I already knew most of the story, so I could only enjoy the shocks through the audience.  One of those films that it is hard to talk about for fear of giving away any of the numerous surprises.  All I will say is that this film has one of the best casting jobs in history.  Everyone is perfect for their role.  Even though the description of the movie is rather bleak, there are many funny lines in the movie that are even funnier upon repeat viewing (Hitchcock has said that this was a comedy).  I even like the much-maligned ending; ends the film on a satiric note.  One of the best movies ever made.",
823,29 August 2017,christophershobris,10, Revolutionary Horror Film,"I just recently seen this film for the first time ever. I didn't know much about in terms of story, actors, or really much of anything except it is considered Hitchcock's most popular film. After nearly 60 years later the film still has an impact. One thing is for sure, it inspired modern horror. A smart, bone-chilling, suspenseful horror film. No other horror film has had as much gravitas as Psycho before it, or since. The film is practically flawless starting with a sinister performance by Anthony Perkins. It doesn't take long once we meet him that something is definitely amiss with him. That's one of the things that Hitchcock does so well is he constantly cranks up the suspense, and twists our nerves and minds until it can't be tightened anymore than he lets loose. Revealing twists and turns no other director would ever think of. Psycho perfectly represents that, as the characters are well thought out, and each scene is cleverly put together. This film also holds some of the most iconic moments in cinema. Along with the creepy wrenching music by Bernard Herrman, which adds a whole new level of tension, to bring these wonderfully eerie scenes to life. As no other film before or since has ever reached the magnitude to Psycho, and it will stay that way for decades or even centuries to come.

In my opinion, his work is almost as timeless as The Twilight Zone. However, The Birds and Psycho mar his filmography of great mysterious noir and usher in horror ahead of its time. Even though Psycho gets universal praise, I found it to be slow and without the jump scares which became perfected by the mid-90s. With only one or two scenes which really compel the audience to feel the surprise of an edge of their seat turn of events, this film plays too much on the atmosphere to be truly ranked among the greats of the genre. The main character is slightly unlikeable as the film begins, and this pulls me out of the story a bit. Overall, it's good, but not as good as they say.",

The story is incredible, the acting is near perfection, the cinematography is awesome, the soundtrack is perfect. It's hard to find anything wrong with Psycho. Perhaps the only imperfection I can find is the Inability to stand the test of time. One of the Reasons the shower scene has become so notorious Is that it's not only filmed to perfection, but because the elements of sexuality and murder are so surreal. In 1960, seeing a nude women being murdered in the shower was something no-one had experienced yet, and was quite shocking. Nowadays, seeing double-Jason Spearing two lovers having sex is nothing uncommon. Psycho its nothing like that, it's more! Aside from this though, the movie is flawless, the cinematography it's just incredible. The movie is perfectly casted as well. Janet Leigh to the beautiful and sexy Marion Crane; Vera Miles to the Concerned sister; Lila Crane excellent; and of course the unforgettable performance from Anthony Perkins to the eerie yet charismatic Norman Bates.

I wanna keep the story like that and won't watch the other Psycho movies. It is also interesting to know all what the movie involved during the production and after.

Everything about this film was intriguing, mysterious, and kept you on edge. Lighting and shadows were pushed further than I've seen in a film so far. A memorable and iconic film has to do with either the ending, the score, or a specific scene. Psycho takes the cake and checks off all three boxes multiple times. The actors delivered their roles and made you feel like you never truly knew what was going on, which added to the suspense. The ending totally threw me off guard, and made me rethink the whole plot. It's important to note how well the script was written, because it makes the ending that much better.

845,27 December 2003,hung_fao_tweeze,8, Don't get me wrong....but,"This is a very fine movie. Yet I grew a bit weary of it after the 4th or 5th time. The first time I saw it I raved. That is also when it left it's greatest impact. After you are knowledgeable of the conclusion, some of the impact wanes, if you know what I mean. It is a great movie but I think a bit over-rated. The second time I viewed it I am more able to appreciate the 'Hitchcock' technique of steering the viewer to assume a conclusion. In lesser hands this could have been mediocre. (See the sequels) Hitchcock has never failed to capture beautiful angles with each camera shot. Even after several viewings a veteran can still be unbalanced by Hitch's foreboding approach. Despite loving this film it would probably not be one I would select to show at a Halloween get-together - especially to those who have seen it a few times before. I am more 'chilled' by other movies. However, at a film discussion get-together - YES. If you haven't seen it - DO! You will love it!! If you've seen it once do see it again and enjoy Hitch's story-telling. He is quite good. If you've seen it frequently you are probably like me and don't NEED to see it again although it remains dear to your heart. I've often wondered how Hitch would have handled 'The Sixth Sense'?",

It also show that we can never know what is hiding in minds of people, even the one we know very good (Not just Norman twisted mind, but Marion Crane's ""betrayal""). Movie has very original story lines, it's not just some ""stereotypical horror movie"" on what are we accustomed when it come to them. I liked that as movie progressing mystery for the main characters become bigger and bigger, but not for us. Trough the whole movie we think that we know what's happening, until that plot twist at the end (one of the best horror movie plot twist ever) which surprise us all. I honesty didn't expect something like that happening! Acting in the movie was awesome,and every single one of the main characters pulled out an excellent performance.

What really surprised me was that the blood from the notorious 'shower scene' was actually chocolate syrup! For me after 'North By Northwest' this was Hitchcock's best piece of work.

857,9 December 2019,isanchez-09497,10, Amazing film! - Spoiler Alert,"A quite famous film known as Psycho is one of the classics made by Alfred Hitchcock that was released in 1960 and is very iconic to many people still today. I can certainly understand why. I personally love watching movies and could watch them ten times over and still not be bored. I truly enjoyed viewing this film and was interested the whole way through. Although, I can admit that certain parts of the film were not as enjoyable, but I think that is just because of the age of the film. I couldn't find much at all to complain about this film. That aside older movies are truly unique because it shows the building block to where we have come today in the movie world. Psycho is an outstanding film because it gave me a variety emotions all throughout it, I found myself irritated, on edge, and truly shocked. While viewing this film I caught myself almost yelling at the TV because of what the characters would do. Ms. Crane is a great example because while she was alive in the movie she seemed to make every single wrong and stupid move possible. For example, when she fell asleep in her car on the side of the road and the officer came up to her window the first thing she does is jolt up and start the car. This instantly makes her look incredibly suspicious, which is the last thing she should be doing considering she just stole 40,000 dollars. In my opinion I think Ms. Crane is so stupid the whole time she is alive, but every thriller needs a victim. This is also her character that Hitchcock gave Janet Leigh to play the role of. Ms. Lane is definitely the protagonist in Psycho because what we can take from the movie as in what she says and does. When I was watching the movie I was on edge waiting to find out what happens next. I couldn't believe that an old black and white film would have me as interested as I was. Ms. Crane goes through pretty much the entire movie struggling with her internal thoughts, which gives the film internal conflict. Hitchcock incorporated this element to convey how guilty Marion felt about taking the money. Even though Psycho is an older film, it's really amazing how it can still capture the attention of a modern day audience. When Norman's ""mother"" was sneaking up on Ms. Crane in the shower I found that to be very suspenseful. Hitchcock did a great job at building suspense for the viewers of Psycho. This movie also really shocked me because I wasn't expecting this old 1960 horror film to be such a great movie. This was the first time I have seen this movie and I really enjoyed it, when at first I was critical. Psycho was a great film in my opinion and I took a lot from this viewing experience. I really enjoyed the movie and all it had to offer. More times than not movies have awful endings, but in this case I actually favored the ending because he was at least caught. To summarize, this film was well worth the watch!",

I wanted to make a movie like this so bad. Then i realized i wasn't that talented. This movie is a great suspense, because when you watch this movie, you try to put all the pieces together, but you just can't do it, and get an answer so different from what you thought. In the beginning of this movie , when i was watching it for the first time, i thought Janet Leigh was the mother, but boy oh boy was i wrong ( and stupid ).

I felt like the meaning behind the movie wasn't that strong because it was just a ""horror"" film. Behind it, though, there was definitely a hint of mistrust and deceit.

Janet Leigh is Marion Crane our leading lady through Psycho and she has such a iconic role that it has cemented her in pop culture forever and she is amazing and one of my favorite scenes with her is when she is in the car and she is thinking of all of the senarios of what people say after she goes missing and her facial expressions are perfect for describing what she is thinking in her head. Anthony Perkins is Norman Bates and he has one of the scariest preformaces in cinema as the errie owner of the motel who is haunted by his over protective mother and she is a looming part of his life and even in facial expressions alone this guy can be scary and one of the best parts of this movie.the cast also has amazing supporting stars like Vera Miles,John Gavin, Martin Balsam, john McIntire and Simon Oakland the cast that is more supporting is also as good as the main two stars who get plently pf screen time.
Psycho is by far my Favorite Hitchcock movie Psycho plays on peoples fears and also makes some afried of going in the shower and that was only thought of because of Psycho and it is one of those moves that has become so iconic that it's a movie that is a must watch for horror fans and for any movie buff or general movie watcher and i would recommend it as it is a Hitchcock movie that lot's of people were talking about and still haven't stopped talking about and that is why i rate Psycho 10/10 it is supurb",
870,17 August 2021,aingmire-26563,8," Boring, but great","This movie is very disappointing and is way overrated. The acting is alright and it has a great tone to it, but it's just very boring. At least half the movie is just boring with a bunch of dialogue. The movie is actually pretty good aside from the pacing.",
871,28 June 2021,grogan81,10, Still mesmerizing!,"Always watch this when it is showing. I remember when I was a kid hearing my mom talking about this film especially the shower scene. I knew I would have to see it at some point. Eventually saw it on tv years later and it didn't disappoint. And it still doesn't to this day. In 2015 it was on the big screen as part of a Fathom Events series and I had to see it in this form. So I took my youngest daughter with me who had never seen it. She was gripping her seat throughout. And this was a kid who grew up watching 80s slasher films. Mission accomplished. This movie is the template for those slasher movies. In the first scene it is obvious that Marion (Janet Leigh) and Sam (John Gavin) are in a sordid relationship. In that later genre this seals her fate. And her sister Lila (Vera Miles) is the original ""Last Girl"". The story is superb. Great acting ( although John Gavin is mediocre) especially Anthony Perkins as Norman . The black-and-white cinematography escalates the creepiness effect. And the music score? Even people who have never seen this film are familiar with it. The camera effects outstanding. The shots when Vera Miles approached the house to confront Mrs. Bates. As for my daughter, the climactic scene in the fruit cellar freaked her out. I would say that is great filmmaking.",
872,21 August 2009,lucianomarzo92,9, Psycho!,"This film is a classic. Everything about it is great. The acting (especially Anthony Perkins; his performance as Norman Bates was absolutely flawless, but also Janet Leigh), the filming, the directing by the genius Hitchcock, and let us not forget the shocking score(!), by Bernard Hermann. I watched this movie with some friends, and the guy next to me jumped so high during the stairs scene he bumped his head on a shelf! But then again we had the volume too high. But there was no way no know until....RE RE RE RE!, and then it was too late. This movie must be watched from start to finish without interruption. Every single scene is so competently filmed and acted, especially the very last scene with Norman Bates' iconic grin. Do not bother with the remake. Everything you would want out of a classic suspense film is all right here. I saw a few seconds of the remake and that was all it took. It does not even serve as a relic of this timeless original, making the whole remake rather pointless. This precise film-making can just cannot be recreated. If you have not already watched it and are interested go ahead. It's great!",
873,29 January 2019,ironcraftleague,8, A revolutionary movie but posses flaws.,"This is a great and revolutionary film. I really enjoyed it and loved all aspects and all around the mystery that swirls around it. Still though, they're sometimes flaws within this film. There are scenes that aren't so clear and it doesn't allow you to figure out anything. It's annoying when I'm very invested in a film and it gives me something I can't comprehend. Beside the fact that I can't follow some details and scenes, there is a scene that bugs me in general and it's a scene where the detective gets attacked and falls very weird. It's clear that there's some kind of editing to the background and it's very annoying to look at. It felt like a very fake scene and I took me out of what was supposed to be a very scary scene. All around, I really enjoyed this movie I just wish there was better execution with editing and screenplay in order to make it feel more real and just to look better in that one annoying scene. 8/10.",
874,18 April 2014,lina_shakira96,9, Black and white thriller,"When i was younger i believed that there is no way a black and white thriller to be good enough. My brother always told me to watch Psycho but i was like: An old movie like that, NO!!! One day i watched it and i was like wow that is a masterpiece, i could not believe that a black and white movie could make me love it so much. The plot is flawless, it makes you anxious and satisfied in the end. The bathroom scene (which is one of the most famous scenes worldwide) was amazing. Anthony Perkins interpretation was so good. I am a huge fan of movies that conclude crazy main characters. To those who hasn't seen it yet i recommend to choose one rainy night and watch it. Also i believe that psycho is one of the must see thrillers such as Stanley Kubrics: The Shinning, Hide and Seek, Lost in Highway and the others.",

876,17 November 2003,christophaskell,9, In a way that only Alfred Hitchcock can...he rocked my world,"It was a little weird when I sat down to watch Psycho for the first time a few hours ago. Being a fan of horror films, I've been told by everyone that this was the one I have to see. Talk about a reputation to live up to, I didn't honestly see how it could be as good as it was supposed to be. I recently had been hearing great things about A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum', and was disappointed in that, so my solely-based-on-reputation expectations were a little shot, plus I'd heard so much about the shower scene I figured that was the big payoff. Well, in a way that only Alfred Hitchcock can do it, any expectations I had were not only met but shattered. I cannot imagine the impact this movie must have had on audiences in 1960, even watching it forty years later on my DVD player with the volume turned down he rocked my world. If you're someone who hates top 200 lists because they're usually all the same, ignore the fact that this on every one and give it a chance, it honestly deserves any attention it's got over the years. All of the acting is solid, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) is believable in his difficult role and Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) gets scared with the best of em. The soundtrack is perfect, and there's some great cinematography in a few of the more dramatic moments, making Psycho' close to a perfect horror film. I'm going to jump on the bandwagon and say that if you haven't seen this movie yet, stop what you're doing and go rent it/buy it/steal it, whatever you need to do to watch it. Rating: 34/40",
877,24 February 2014,haider_samurai,9," Best psychological thriller, a true Hitchcock Masterpiece","To me Psycho is the best movie from the master of thrill and suspense Alfred Hitchcock. It has everything that makes a thriller perfect, the start is a bit different from the plot but that is what making psycho even more beautiful, the tension in Marion Crane's (Janet Leigh) mind weather to steal and run away or remain loyal, the free way scene with cop following her and then her entry to the BATES Motel, the main concern of the movie, Everything is shot to perfection. The music never gets better, it sounds to be created specially to scare you. Norman Bates has a very special characteristic in his character and no one could have played him better but Anthony Perkins. Hang on guys, because no one is going to relieve himself of the great tension from start lasting through the entire movie up till the final frame. Anthony Perkins is the reason why you are never gonna feel out of the movie for even a second, and you never forget him even after watching this flick. It's not an ordinary horror film because everything makes sense, a mother's love is eternal.",
