2,14 May 2005,Doylenf,9, The clever plot makes multiple viewings mandatory for full enjoyment...,THE STING is so full of twists and turns at every unexpected moment that it never stops drawing you into all of its traps. All of it is performed at a fast clip and the performances have all the nuances needed to keep you entertained and in suspense.,e
3,15 March 2004,JamesHitchcock,9, The Moral Order Restored,"Johnny Hooker and Luther Coleman are 'grifters' or confidence tricksters in 1930s Chicago. Unknown to them, however, one of their victims works for a vicious local gangster named Doyle Lonnegan, and when Lonnegan finds out what has happened he has Luther murdered. Hooker is not a violent man by nature and admits that he does not know much about killing, but nevertheless wishes to take revenge for his partner's death. He decides that the best way is to hurt Lonnegan's pride by relieving him of some of his wealth. He joins forces with another con man named Henry Gondorff, and together they come up with an elaborate plan, not only to cheat Lonnegan, but also to do it in such a way that he never realises that he has been cheated. The plot unfolds with great ingenuity; until the final denouement the audience are never quite sure which developments are for real and which are part of the elaborate scheme.",v
4,5 May 2014,planktonrules,10, Quite good--especially the first time you see it.,"It's been decades since I've seen ""The Sting"" and I decided to try watching it again. As a result of having seen it a couple times, I have some impressions I might not have had the first time. First, the film is awfully pretty--with some of the nicest titles and intertitle cards I've seen. It also is well-constructed--with several plots being interwoven quite well--a tribute to the director, George Roy Hill. The acting is quite nice and it's interesting that the film won seven Oscars--and none of them for acting! And, just like the first time, the Scott Joplin tunes are terrific. The only real negative is that because I'd seen it before, there were no surprises--and surprises are what makes this such an enjoyable film. Without the surprise, the film lacks something the second time--something that isn't true for all films. ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", for example, seems to get better each time you see it--but ""The Sting"" does because the movie is so dependent of surprise plot twists.",i
5,14 September 2013,AaronCapenBanner,7, Fun Caper Comedy.,"Paul Newman & Robert Redford reunite for this Academy Award winning film directed by George Roy Hill about two con men who team up to avenge the death of a mutual friend by ""stinging"" a mob boss(played by Robert Shaw). Film details their intricate plan to do so, which involves an excellent cast including Charles Durning, Ray Walston, & Eileen Brennan, among others. The story climaxes in an elaborate swindle that may well fool the audience. Fine use of vintage 1930's jazz music appropriate for the period.",e
6,21 February 2005,gelman@attglobal.net,10, And Don't Forget Scott Joplin!,"I agree 100 percent that this is a wonderful movie. I first saw it over 30 years ago, and it remains vivid in my mind while I can't remember zip about movies I saw last week which others have praised and I found wanting. I can't think of another film about double and triple crosses that deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence with ""The Sting"" (which doesn't mean that some of the others haven't been good). In addition to all the things that others have praised, one of the most memorable features of this film is the use of a Scott Joplin rag, which both lends a distinctive period touch and adds a sense of fast-paced motion to the action. I'm not much for ranking films -- top five, top ten, top 250 -- but this is one of the best. If you haven't already seen it, drop everything and find the DVD. As pure entertainment, it can't be beat.",w

I saw this movie when it first came out (Floral Park, NY) and many times times since. It never gets old. The look, acting, story and, of course, the music are all top notch.

It is entirely plot-driven with no real stand out characters or personalities.  What makes the film work is excellent production design and a delightfully clever plot filled with many surprises.  The movie is feather-weight emotionally, but the depth of the ""con"" and the way it is fashioned by screenwriter David Ward leaves you with a pleasant experience.",e

23,15 October 2015,Seraphion,7, A mixed understanding for a kid of different time frame,"The story is nicely constructed, taking use of the duration to elaborate on the original motive of the daring move, as well as the careful planning, recruitment and staged execution of the big con.But that's the view I get when I put myself in the shoes of people of the seventies, at the time this movie was out. Now, with the significant advance in technology, and also the many modern con and heist movies with comparable plot twists and turns, this movie seems dwarfed by all those. Also I see that the movie didn't do enough justice on side characters that turns out to have quite a significance at the end, like Loretta. These characters don't develop well enough to be well explained. The acting overall is quite good. I think I now know how Tom Cruise gets his usual trademark of grinning almost all the time in most of his roles. Paul Newman did great in portraying the con artist, with all the necessary ""acting within acting"". Robert Shaw also played very well, maintaining the expressions of suspicion and greed within.",=

25,18 September 2002,zetes,6, The height of mediocrity,"The Sting may not be the worst film ever to win the Best Picture award at the Oscars, but it's easily one of the most mediocre. The settings look fake, the actors look bored, and the story has numerous flaws, and is predictable to boot. I mean, what happened to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid? Paul Newmann and Robert Redford made such a great pair in Hill's earlier film. They barely even talk to each other in The Sting. Every bit of characterization to be found in the film is in Redford, but he's wrong for the role. And how could someone waste Charles Durning so egregiously? Perhaps the only bit of greatness in the film is in the score, adapted from Scott Joplin's music - or at least it would be great if it added any mood or depth to the film. I certainly didn't hate this movie, but, like I said, it's the height of mediocrity. 6/10.",t

27,22 October 2005,aharmas,7," entertaining, yet not quite perfection","I saw this movie when I was a kid and remember it didn't quite make a good impression on me. There were many aspects of it that I remembered fondly: its music, its look, the star quality of its main actors, and yet, it didn't move the ways other 70's movies did. It didn't have the shock and anguish of the ""The Exorcist"", a movie with plenty of humanity under its still impressive special effects. It didn't connect with me in the way ""The Paper Chase"" related to the subversive in all young people share. ""Chinatown"" wrapped itself around its audience like a sad song, and ""Cabaret"" chilled us with its disintegration of life as we know it. ""The Sting"" was impressive but it was like that work behind the glass: untouchable, and yet something worth admiring. I look back and can't help thinking how ""Paper Moon"" brought back an era, with its flaws, humanity, and spirit quite intact.",u
28,4 October 2016,Fella_shibby,10, One of the best heist film. Awesome screenplay.,"I remember seeing this movie during the mid 80s. Saw this few years back on a rented DVD. Enjoyed it. One of my fav movie. It is a perfectly paced movie. One of the best heist film. The film paid proper attention to details from the setting, to how characters talked, to what they wore. The music was good. It's a great balance between comedy and drama. The movie is exciting and very entertaining. The acting was simply perfect. Robert Redford and Paul Newman gave lovely performances. The cast is so rich with Redford, Newman, Shaw, Walston, Gould, Durning, Brennan... Direction by George Roy Hill was flawless. But I still love his previous work, Butch Cassidy.... Awesome job by David S. Ward as a writer. It has one of the best screenplay. The story has enough twists n the character development is superb. I was rooting for the gang to succeed in the heist. The villain was convincing in being nasty, smileless n a crooked fella who needed to be looted. The twist and turns is great and the film is almost perfect.",r

They think they were lucky to get away with several thousand dollars but it is mob money and mob boss Doyle Lonnegan wants to make an example of anybody who crosses his organisation. Soon Coleman is dead and it looks like Hooker will be next. Hooker isn't intending to run though; he wants to get revenge for his friend's death. To this end he teams up with Henry Gondorff, a specialist in the long con. Lonnegan won't be an easy mark though; his only known weakness is his enjoyment of high stakes pokerÂ… but as he cheats he won't be easy to beat. The poker will just be the hook; to really hurt him they must persuade him to place a very large bet where he thinks he is the one cheating and when it is over he mustn't know that he has been connedÂ… it might not be easy but it will be worth it.",
31,14 October 2007,moonspinner55,6, Old-fashioned and polished...but with an artificial look and a draggy midsection,"In 1936 Chicago, a con-artist and a cocky grifter team up to '86' the slimy racketeer who killed the grifter's best friend. Handsome production, fun ragtime music score (courtesy of Oscar-winner Marvin Hamlisch, via Scott Joplin) and lots of star-wattage from a first-rate cast helped make ""The Sting"" hugely popular in 1973, leading to seven Academy Award wins including Best Picture. It's an astute, polished movie made with panache, yet the story isn't mounted with much excitement, stretching a fairly standard revenge plot an awfully long way. There's too much talk and story exposition for the film to juggle successfully, and the middle section bogs down. The now-famous finale is pulled off with high good humor, though the set here is an eyesore (most of the picture is filmed in ugly browns and reds, though cinematographer Robert Surtees did receive an Oscar nod for his work). Good performances by Paul Newman and Robert Redford in the leads, a terrific one by Robert Shaw as their nemesis. Director George Roy Hill won the Best Director Oscar; David S. Ward won for his screenplay. Ward later went on to write a sequel, ""The Sting II"", in 1983, with Jackie Gleason and Mac Davis starring. **1/2 from ****",

This goes for David Ward's screenplay - characters, dialogue, scene writing, and narrative, all dynamic and engrossing, and throwing a couple surprises at the audience. This goes for George Roy Hill's direction, and Robert Surtees' cinematography - lending to exquisite arrangement of every shot and scene, and vibrant imagery from start to finish. The casting is extraordinary, with notable and very recognizable names and faces - Robert Redford and Paul Newman, of course, but also Eileen Brennan, Robert Shaw, Robert Earl Jones, Charles Durning, Ray Walston, Dana Elcar, and Charles Dierkop, among still others. Everyone turns in outstanding, nuanced performances that are inescapably enchanting - and kudos as well to the stunt performers for fine contributions.",

I then found the film boring because I never understood it and there was little action. I would have been 15 or 16 at the time.

35,2 September 2022,gbill-74877,9, Brilliant,"From the beginning of The Sting, it's clear that we're in a world where there is no moral high ground. A criminal syndicate is ripped off by a team of grifters, their delivery man having failed in his attempt to rob them instead. One of the grifters (Robert Redford) is then ripped off by a casino via a fixed roulette wheel, and then held up by a crooked cop. After he finds his buddy has been murdered by the order of the boss (Robert Shaw), he turns to a common friend (Paul Newman) to seek revenge. Everyone is a con here, even the police are on the take, and it's the cleverest con who wins. The card game on the train with both men cheating is a perfect battle of alpha predators, and it all leads up to and elaborate ""sting.""",

That's how low the bar is for a rave. And it's why I don't much care for movies like The Sting. It's idea of film merit is to pre-sell the production so they don't have to worry about people comprehending anything or thinking about much. This movie proves that if you market some star power and a little production design you can trick people into thinking they've seen a great movie. It's so sure that its casting director and designers did a fantastic job, that it fails put much energy into it's characters or story. It's not as well-designed or produced as movies both before and after. It's not too interesting, it's not much fun and though some people describe it as 'funny' I can't name a line I laughed at.

40,3 April 2022,boblipton,10, One Of The Great Movies,"This multiple-Academy-Award movie -- best picture, director and script to begin with -- is one of the great movies of the 1970s. It's not just that the entire production is filled with spot-on bits, from 1930s-style wipes, great performances from the leads and supporting players, and a cynical attitude that speaks to me. David S. Ward's script takes you down the rabbit hole, and debouches unexpectedly. It's that toughest of things to produce in a movie, a sense of the unreliable narrator a story where all the characters are giving performances, with the exception of Charles Durning and Robert Shaw. Everyone else is lying and knows it, and the audience knows it too. As a result this tale of how all the confidence men in Chicago are pulling game on Robert Shaw to get revenge for his having killed one of their own, Robert Earl Jones is filled with unexpected depths. I can and do watch it every year or so, and marvel at its perfection.",

So much more.,"An absolutely perfect caper comedy, one so genuinely thrilling that every movie that it has influenced over the past 50 years in one way or another hasn't even come close to surpassing it. The musical theme is still heard today, and the soundtrack album of the movie shows that the music is much more than just the adoption of Scott Joplin's classic themes. Montages of the film's caper plotline, weather in the movie or done by music video editors, show a choreography within the film that George Roy Hill brilliantly displayed in his direction.

I'm a fan of caper films such as the ""Ocean's Eleven"" or ""National Treasure"" movies, and this is no exception (in fact, this is probably the best caper film I've seen). I didn't think Robert Redford and Paul Newman would be able to top ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" their previous film together, but they totally did. It's a great plot that ends up ""stinging"" not only the characters but the audience as well (see it to find out what I mean). It's a great balance between comedy and drama; it can be quite dramatic, but when it's funny, it's very funny. The plot involves Newman and Redford taking revenge on a gangster who killed one of their men. It's a complex, fun-filled story that entertains and mesmerizes. Some people are shot with guns, but nothing in the film is too difficult for the average person to watch, in my opinion. Not only are Newman and Redford excellent, but so is the supporting cast, including Robert Shaw, Harold Gould, and Charles Durning. The film won Best Picture of 1973, which was deserved. The film is just excellent. One of my personal favorites.",

47,12 December 2017,Horror-yo,5," Too long, too slow & between impossible to take seriously and not that fun to watch","The Sting, 1973, is the sort of film that gave rise to the grifter /crime type that has since proliferated and taken such forms in the modern day as your Oceans Eleven Twelve series where the whole plot relies on a giant scam which as it progresses reveals smaller sub-plots or sub-scams, like mini twists that keep the movie alive all this time. It turns out this one here is a bit silly in concept, but as a film why not - the only problem is as much as the movie demands a great deal of indulgence from the viewer, it doesn't in turn offer, well, all that much fun. You can do with a couple of inaccuracies and play the role wearing a thick lens for a film's time, but this here is two hours and ten minutes, it just goes on and on and there isn't enough to cover that length.",

51,23 November 2014,writers_reign,9, Grasping The Nettle,"By the purest of coincidences I watched two films starring Paul Newman in one day, one on the big screen and one on DVD, and both stood up amazingly well. I have already covered his breakout role as Rocky Graziano in Somebody Up There Likes Me, which was screened at the National Film Theatre, after which I came home and played the DVD of The Sting. Both films benefited from outstanding supporting roles though Somebody lacked a co-star of the stature of Robert Redford, and The Sting was replete with the likes of Ray Walston, Eileen Brennan, Robert Shaw - who, to be fair, shared equal billing with Redford and Newman - Harold Gould etc. The sure-footed screenplay by David S.

53,23 April 2004,JohnSeal,5, Hopelessly overrated,"Best film, my hat. The Sting is an entertaining, attractive, well scored, well acted, well costumed sweetmeat that somehow caught the public's imagination and rode its box office success to the Academy Awards. The vapid script by no means qualifies it as a great caper flick, with Rififi, Topkapi, and even the rather poor Deadfall (1968) running rings round it. The film looks great, but its take on the 1920s if strictly of the chocolate box variety, and Redford really should have been given a haircut before production began.

Although the take was only $11,000, it belonged to a Mob boss named Doyle Lonnegan, (Robert Shaw) who immediately puts a contract on the two.

From all the films which i saw done in this time, all the greats had the edition as a very strong point. It's not coincidence,for sure.The Score is very lighthearted with a lot of comedic tons. It fits perfectly in the film, because despite a few deaths which en- darken a bit the atmosphere, the sting is a very 'UP' film overall.

It is the 1930's, and Johnny Hooker (Oscar nominated Robert Redford) is the young conman being taught by Luther Coleman (Robert Earl Jones, father of James, aka Darth Vader's voice). One day they get netted into a con job, and what they don't know is the man they conned is the courier for a numbers runner. The boss Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw) turns out to considers this an attack on him and orders termination of all involved. Hooker is shaken by crooked cop Lt. Wm. Snyder (The Muppet Movie's Charles Durning) and says unless he pays him off he will turn him over. He pays him and tries to warn Luther, but it is too late. He then goes to great conman Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman) who had some bad luck. Luther hears what happened, and sees Hooker hungry for payback, so he assembles a gang and decides to con Lonnegan. The story really picks up (it was slow for a while) when Henry cheats in the poker game, and Lonnegan has to rely on phone calls from an unknown man Henry knows to get the money he owes. These phone calls tell him to bet on certain horses with a high chance of winning. This plan seems to go well, and it concludes with the final bet where Lonnegan makes a mistake, and Henry and Hooker are killed, before Lonnegan leaves. But the entire room was set-up with people acting, and Henry and Hooker made it look like they had died, the biggest and best con, or 'The Sting', resulting in getting $500,000. Also starring Ray Walston as J.J. Singleton, Eileen Brennan as Billie, Patch Adams' Harold Gould as Kid Twist, John Heffernan as Eddie Niles, Dana Elcar as F.B.I. Agent Polk, Jack Kehoe as Erie Kid and Dimitra Arliss as Loretta. A fantastic period (gangster) crime caper, with some great cons, great chases, and great actors.

Butch Cassidy was diverting, had some charm, and was nice to look at, but The Sting is cloying, claustrophobic, and its charm calculated, and at 129 minutes it seems interminable because nothing in this film about an elaborate con involving good-hearted crooks seems to matter. As for movies dealing with cons, I prefer A Big Hand for a Little Lady, Trick Baby, House of Games, Felini's Il Bidone (""The Swindlers"") and even Harry in Your Pocket which was released in 1973 the same year The Sting was named Best Picture while Badlands, Sleeper, Payday, The Homecoming, The Long Goodbye, Mean Streets, Paper Moon, The Last Detail and Serpico were not even nominated for Best Picture",

This film Directed by the underrated George Roy Hill revolves around small time swindler Johnny Hooker (Robert Redford). After his friend Luther (Robert Earl Jones) is murdered at the hands of notorious crime boss Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw), Hooker enlists the help of famous swindler Henry Gondorf (Paul Newman). Gondorf and Hooker decide to get back at Lonnegan by using the big con. This plan involves a high stakes card game, creating a book with phony horse races and even the ""FBI"". Through all of this, Hooker is being chased by a dirty cop working for Lonnegan (Charles Durning). What a plot! But that's not all that's great about this movie. The acting by Redford, Newman and Shaw is also great. Not to mention the great adapted score.

130,26 December 2020,ArthurFinney,8, No headline.,"The strongest aspect of this film is the plot. The con devised by the protagonists is incredibly elaborate and rather than being explained at the beginning, the viewer learns it by watching it play out. This allows it to cleverly surprise the audience several times and only at the end do we fully understand it. Another strong aspect is the production design. The sets and costumes manage to create a beautiful and fully authentic picture of the 1930s and the film could probably stand on its imagery alone.
The protagonists Hooker and Gondorff are both likable but the character who really stands out is the antagonist, Doyle Lonnegan. He has a quiet, aloof demeanor and lives a straight edge lifestyle but is shown to be utterly ruthless and his actor, Robert Shaw, gives an intimidating performance. A lot of entertaining side characters can also be found, particularly among the con artsits.
Another noteworthy aspect is the dialogue, which is rich with slang and colloquialisms from the time period. Some might find it a bit confusing, while others will like it.
The ragtime music, though anachronistic for the time period, is another strong point and does a great job of setting the mood. Overall, though I'm not sure if I would consider it one of the greatest films ever made, I thoroughly enjoyed this and recommend it to anyone.",

That being said, the production design and the costumes are excellent features of this movie. But not only is this film stylish, it also has a deep plot.

I usually am hesitant to watch a movie that I have seen so many times, but I popped in the video a few days ago. I am telling you, the movie never gets old. It is entertaining throughout the whole movie. Why is this movie so great? Number one - the soundtrack. I had heard that Joplin's rags were played much slower back in the day than in the movie. It is also odd that music written about 1900 would fit into a movie about the 1930s. However, the music fits in so well and makes the movie flow so well with it. Secondly, the acting. Robert Redford is a bit overrated as an actor, but this is by far his best role. He really shined like he has never shined before and since. Shaw and Newman were brilliant. I liked all the supporting actors and actresses, too. Thirdly, the plot was just so cohesive and fun. Everything was worked out to the minutest detail to entertain.

The return of the Dynamic Duo, Paul Newman and Robert Redford --after their spectacular success with Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid was highly anticipated in 1973. They again teamed up with director George Roy Hill --and again--produced the goods. Hills passion for having no ""fat"" in his movies is very much in evidence. The pace is fast , and the viewer is expected to have a reasonable I.Q. and be able to watch and LISTEN. The Sting is often called ""complex""......I completely disagree with that.

You could point to several stand-out scenes, but my personal favorite was the train set-up with Newman and Shaw. I thought Newman completely nailed it in every respect. Watching cheater Lonigan (Robert Shaw) fume and get cheated at cards with flamboyant and snide Newman was acting at it's all around finest and most entertaining from all involved.

171,25 December 2007,HelloTexas11,8, a real crowd-pleaser,"'The Sting' features the most likable bunch of thieves, scam-artists, and con-men you've ever seen in your life. There's not one of them that you wouldn't want to sit down and play a game of poker with, even if they stole your pants off. Even the baddest of the bad guys, Robert Shaw's Doyle Lonnegan, is likable, because he's such a great foil for the two most likable rogues, Paul Newman's Henry Gondorff and Robert Redford's Johnny Hooker. If this were a serious movie about confidence men in the 1930's and the 'sting' they pull off, that likability factor would be a fatal drawback, but it's not, so it isn't. No, 'The Sting' might well be considered the ultimate crowd-pleasing flick, consistently hitting all the right buttons for a mass audience. Everything, right down to the music, or maybe even especially the music, is just right. Scott Joplin's piano rags are masterfully adapted for the film by Marvin Hamlisch; you'll be humming them and hearing them in your head for weeks after watching. In fact, 'The Sting' is almost like a period musical without singers or dancing. It's too brightly lit, too cozy and comfortable with itself, too (I'm trying desperately not to say 'likable' again) in love with its characters to achieve any really threatening moments, even when one suspects that it wants to. There are surprises here and there, but against this feel-good backdrop, even the most potentially shocking ones go down easily, like cotton candy. The ingeniously whimsical plot takes us on Gondorff and Hooker's journey to swindle Lonnegan, a big-time crime boss, out of half a million dollars. The 'big con' is set up elaborately and methodically over the course of the film; that is what accounts for most of the enjoyment we get from it. Grifters are recruited, a fake gambling hall is established, false identities are created, all for the purpose of making Lonnegan believe he can win big by putting up a half-million dollar bet in Gondorff's place. Along the way, there are many subplots, each providing background or motivation for certain characters (mainly Hooker) and in the end, these threads are all neatly tied up in a final scene that is funny and satisfying and which usually results in the film audience breaking into spontaneous applause. None of the performances, with the exception of Robert Shaw's, is particularly outstanding. Newman and Redford have a comedic chemistry that is undeniable, as they proved in 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,' but this isn't really a showcase for either's acting versatility compared to other films they've made. The rest of the cast is a gallery of character actors and it's nice to see them all playing such lovable crooks. I daresay 'The Sting' was a career high point for at least a dozen of them. When the film first came out, it grossed nearly $160 million and it seemed damn near everyone in the country had seen it and loved it. Not many films can make that claim, and so I will say it for the record now: 'The Sting' is the most likable movie ever made.",

I'm a fan of caper films such as the ""Ocean's Eleven"" or ""National Treasure"" movies, and this is no exception (in fact, this is probably the best caper film I've seen). I didn't think Robert Redford and Paul Newman would be able to top ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" their previous film together, but they totally did. It's a great plot that ends up ""stinging"" not only the characters but the audience as well (see it to find out what I mean). It's a great balance between comedy and drama; it can be quite dramatic, but when it's funny, it's very funny. The plot involves Newman and Redford taking revenge on a gangster who killed one of their men. It's a complex, fun-filled story that entertains and mesmerizes. Some people are shot with guns, but nothing in the film is too difficult for the average person to watch, in my opinion. Not only are Newman and Redford excellent, but so is the supporting cast, including Robert Shaw, Harold Gould, and Charles Durning. The film won Best Picture of 1973, which was deserved. The film is just excellent. One of my personal favorites.",

Hill crafts another, wonderfully assembled motion picture, consisting of many cool ideas, crafted into a work of motion picture perfection, 1970s style. This is a very clever film, with plenty of cool ideas and as usual, aesthetically perfect camera framing by Hill.

Reflecting on this , this movie is not that great. Compare this to nowadays series in the likes of The sopranos or Boardwalk empire and this movie falls flat on acting, pacing.As for the directing : its too much directed, you feel that all the scenes are so carefully chosen and that the characters are mainly there to fill the screen. Now, we have today also directors such as Tarantino where you know that every single scene is already played in his head before someone hits the record button, but it doesn't feel that way in most cases ( at least not in this time , maybe in 20 years it does ). I must admit that I do not like Redford. His acting- skills are as bad as Bruce Willis and let's keep it friendly and call it overacting or trying to act. The music is nice though and fits. The sets are OK, but so so visible as done in studio. I liked this movie in the 70's , less liked it in the 80's , and by now I don't like it anymore.

Newman and Redford were glamorous stars: they spoke their lines convincingly, but their personalities didn't change. No doubt I haven't seen all their films, but enough to perceive them as somehow always the same. In a sense, type-cast. The British actor, on the other hand, here Robert Shaw, disappears into his role, in the tradition of innumerable actors of the same school: Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers, Anthony Hopkins, the incomparable Gary Oldman. Shaw was one of the best, as the variety of his many roles bears witness. Unforgettable as Henry VIII in A Man for All Seasons, as Aston in The Caretaker.

It gets a slight knock from me; I appreciate the fact that it is heavily an homage to films of the 30s and 40s, but it led to the movie having a bit of a slower pace than I had wanted. It's also billed as a ""comedy"" on this site; it definitely had its comedic bits and an overall light-hearted tone, but I wouldn't necessarily think of it as a side-splitter. The plot is also a little bit confusing on my first viewing, but the last 10 minutes of the film does a nice job of connecting all of the dots for the audience and pulling back the curtain. I loved the finale. I felt as though I had been the one who was swindled. The use of the song ""The Entertainer"" by Scott Joplin got a little bit too much by the end of the movie, in my opinion.

The swindles on the viewer feel fresh and so ridiculously different from contemporary heist movies that instead describe the plan so when it goes wrong you feels the pressure. The second is that each piece of the film feels like it contributes nicely to a solid resolution.

It describes the fraudulent activities of the United States during the Great Depression in the 1930s with a nostalgic approach. The film has always attracted the attention of the audience with playful and whimsical dialogues and serial scam stories. The two actors who are all dramas (Paul Newman, Robert Redford) cooperate with the tacit understanding, and add ""cold noodles"". Robert Shaw's wonderful play, the film won praise from many film critics.
The fun and coolness revealed in the film and the seriousness hidden in it are lacking in many films. Director George Roy Hill did not make the simple plot complex and tricky, but used a one-line narrative to simplify the complex plot. Its superb visual processing skills, excellent storytelling ability and interesting and attractive dialogues promote the development of the whole plot. There is no flashy and lively fight in the film, just relying on the dialogue between the two men makes the whole film full of fun. The clever layout and plot setting make the whole movie watching process not only fun, but also always maintain a sense of tension.
In the opponent play between Paul Newman and Robert Redford, the wonderful chemical reaction is difficult to describe in words, especially Paul Newman 's unmarked perfect acting in the film has been played to the fullest, leaving a record in the history of the film. The image of ""old rivers and lakes"" worth remembering has made many viewers unforgettable.
The film heavily uses the works of black American musician Scott Joblin to render and set off the atmosphere.

I've had the restored version on DVD for a few months now, and I'm trying to wait for the perfect time to settle down with my wife - who also loves the film - and spend two hours in film-based bliss. EDIT: OK, we chose last night to watch the DVD and we were not disappointed - this film gets better every time you see it. Just a few more comments from me, and then i'm off to watch the bonus 'making of'. My first comment concerns the fantastic 'night before the big sting' scene, in which Hooker desperately seeks companionship with the girl at the drugstore. It's a long night, nerves are on edge and no-one sleeps. It's done with no dialogue and very little sound except for the low-key music and a carefully handled feeling of the approaching dawn. It gives me shivers just thinking of it, what superb direction. Then of course the end. A liberating feeling of relief, moral restoration and the appreciation of a job well done (in the plot AND behind the scenes) bring this marvellous film to a joyful end. What can I say? The best, the utter, utter best.",

I chose the Sting and was astonished to discover that none of them had ever seen it and had only a vague idea who Newman and Redford were. Well, this movie was a huge success! Everyone loved it and thought it was fabulous. I even got the ultimate compliment--a kid not even in my class heard about it and commented that she heard I'd shown a really great movie. One of my kids made his father buy the DVD. It was great to watch them watch it, to see their reactions. Saleno getting shot had some of them coming out of their seats with surprise. As a teacher, I am thrilled that these ""old"" films have the power to engage the younger generation raised on high action, special effects films that don't pack half the punch quality wise.

By calling this film ""mediocre"" is doing it a severe disservice. The acting is top notch (except for Dana Elcar, who is noticeably corny in everything), the direction is tight and the film's overall presentation is very cohesive. The music, as adapted from many of Scott Joplin's pieces (which were by no means popular when he wrote them) have been adapted for the film and helped fuel a resurging interest in his work that was definitely ahead of its time. It is hard to ignore both a work of art and commercial success, so if you haven't seen this film yet, please do yourself a favor and rent it tonight. However, if you wish to purchase the DVD, I would wait until the 30th Anniversary Edition is released this year (although I haven't dug up any information on it thus far), because the current edition out right now is a bare bones fullscreen presentation which is noticeably grainy and, because it is fullscreen, it just looks lame.

It reunites Robert Redford and Paul Newman (fresh from Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid) as a pair of loose canon con artists. Redford is Johnny Hooker, a reprobate being groomed by slight of hand master, Luther (Robert Earl Jones). Together, the two devise and carry out an elegant con that nets them a tidy bank roll. However, when mob boss Doyle Lonigan (Robert Shaw) learns of their deception, he orders his men to rub out Luther and Johnny. Hooker is shaken down by crooked Â– if slightly sympathetic police lieutenant, Will Snyder (Charles Durning). But Luther is killed, sending Johnny on a mission to avenge his mentor by employing one of his old acquaintances, Henry Gondorf (Newman). Henry used to be a man in the chips. Now he's yesterday's news. But is he ready to throw in the towel and become a legitimate and productive member of society just yet? Director Hill peppers the plot in a series of ironic mishaps and implausible twists that somehow never become contrived.

What is different about their relationship in this compared to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is that Hooker has no experience and is therefore low on knowledge about how to do a long con compared to Newman's Character Gondorff who has more experience at them. Gondorff is Hooker's mentor who shows him the ropes. Hooker starts off cocky, not believing there is anything Gondorff can show him but gains respect for him the more he is around him. Robert Shaw brilliantly plays Lonnegan and the rest of the cast make the film a success- Robert Earl Jones (Luther), Eileen Brennan (Billie), Charles Durning (Snyder), Dana Elcar (FBI Agent Polk), Ray Walston (J.J.

The protagonist of the movie Johnny Hooker (Redford) is a small time street conman who along with his team intelligently cons people on the road. After a usual day in the office, they find out that they have stolen the money from a big shot crime boss who now is determined to kill all involved in the theft. When the mafia kills one of Hooker's team members and a good friend, he intends to take revenge. Thus along with another big time Conman Henry Gondorff (Newman) and his associates they plan to con the Crime boss himself. The plot is itself very engaging and the director leaves no stone unturned to enrich it. He has divided the movie into different chapters like 'The Hook', 'The Players' etc .

245,13 February 2006,Putzberger,9, You Can't Watch It Just Once,"""The Sting"" is a puzzle box of a movie, and it takes maybe a viewing and a half to decipher the plot, and probably two full viewings to figure out exactly who conned who(m). The time passes quickly, because it's a breezy, wonderfully paced film with no dead spots, even though a few scenes were obviously left in for their charm -- for example, when Kid Twist interviews the Englishman, the audience learns next to nothing about the characters and the plot doesn't advance, but we do feel lucky to be in on the scam. After you've watched it a few times and can anticipate all the plot machinations, you begin to wonder what director Hill & co are trying to sell you here. The film seems to be making the point that all men are thieves, and you can only trust a man who admits he's a thief. (And yes, I mean ""men,"" the women in this film are peripheral, although they're almost all treated respectfully.) That's a rather cynical message, and it makes ""The Sting"" very much a product of the time it portrays, the Depression, and the time it was made, the Watergate era.",
246,3 March 2004,fetreis,10, Speaking of amdmiration,"This is by far and away one of my favorite movies.  Aside from all of that top 100 ranking nonsense this is one of the richest, genuine forms of film. The casting is simply perfect.  Hill's direction along with the impact of a witty, thoughtful script make this a movie admirable throughout the ages. The poker scene on the train with the exchanges between Lonnegan and Gondorff is worth seeing by itself.  The soundtrack makes the movie as well, and one of my favorite parts is at the end when Redford and Newman exchange glances and head out after the con is played while ""the entertainer"" starts up slowly in the background.  In a way i think its unfair that Redford hasnt been more decorated by the academy or his peers.  I think because of the fact that he is so picky with his roles that critics to tend to over analyze him.  With that said I still think Redford should have one his best actor award that he was nominated for that year.  Redford absolutely nailed the Hooker character and his ability to convincingly play both sides between Lonnegan and Gondorff certainly had me fooled the first time i saw the movie.  But there is no question that Redford's character was made better by Paul Newman.  The two playing off each other is classic and i think Paul Newman was grossly overlooked for his role as Gondorff.  Unfortunatly Newman is so talented that i think we tend to take for granted his greatness. Robert Shaw as Doyle could argued as the best character in the movie.  His mannerisms and style make you want to see him get conned.  But its the subtle things about the character that Shaw hits perfectly.  Such as the way that if you look at his face during the poker scene you see the growing distaste for Gondorff.  Or the fact that he only smiles twice in the movie (when he boasts 4 nines and when he tells of putting the 1/2 million on lucky dan) both times he gets conned!  The rest of the cast rounds out well, my personal favorite being Kid Twist.  His scenes with Redford while they string Lonnegan along are believeable even though Doyle is skeptical of the operation.  A movie like this simply captures a persons attention and for that reason The Sting will always be a movie to admire...",

252,7 June 2009,jrocker13,5, Now I've got the sting,"At first I didn't get the title of this film, but after watching it I realized that ""the sting"" was referring to the addiction to gamble. The cast was very well picked out and played their characters wonderfully. The one that really stood out to me was Eileen Brennan. I loved how she played the sultry hostess while getting away with covering up being a pick pocket. This film should be considered a classic because it does bring back the glory days. All the sets and stage areas were crafted so beautifully that it was possible to lose yourself in the movie. The picture itself was not that clear and in my opinion, a little bit fuzzy. But that just added to the overall ambiance. Some things I didn't like about this move was that the plot did get confusing from the middle to the ending. The actors themselves played their characters well, but there could have been better interaction between them. At several points in the movie it seemed that there was no genuine interaction between the characters that were supposed to be working together. Betting and gambling was never any interest of mine so the fact that this movie revolved around that was kind of boring to me. It was fun however, watching foolish men gamble away their money in the hopes of making more on what they bet. The best part was at the beginning when Hooker and Luther pull of a con to get eleven grand from an unsuspecting target. I really believed that Hooker gave the guy the money and was surprised when he opened the package to find tissues instead of money. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys watching movie's with clever plots and memorable actors.",

Sometimes i wanna fall asleep so bad that i have nightmares i am still awake. The only interesting part was the naked woman at the beginning. If there was more of that this could deserve a two star review. But even that can't make me love it. It's one of those movies you have to be crazy to enjoy.

Paul Newman and Robert Redford are real stars in this film, and in my opinion neither have made better films before or after this (although Redford comes close with All the President's Men).

The 1st hr of the movie isn't as well paced as the 2ndÂ…this is when Newman appears. This is also one of the rare movies that I have seen where they use the word Con which I guess is usually restricted to fiction novels. It has a good plot, no doubt about that. The screenplay is well done especially for the train scene. Another worth noting thing about the movie is its art direction, you really feel you are into 1930s. It is hard to say who, Newman or Redford has done better job, just like in Butch & Cassidy.

264,8 June 2009,krcoe,10, The Sting,"The movie The Sting was released in 1973. It is about Jonny Hooker, a small time hustler, happy to play the marks in Joliet until one day his mentor, Luther, gets murdered by the dirtiest mug in Chicago, Doyle Lonnegan.

265,11 March 2003,baseballfanjm,10, Pure entertainment,"The Sting isn't the kind of movie that you watch and are completely mesmerized by. You aren't blown away by anything, though the costumes and sets are fantastic. The Sting, quite simply, wants to entertain you, while offering a very interesting plot. This is where it succeeds, as you'll be hard pressed to find a movie that combines fun and a great plot as well as writing than The Sting. I won't go into details, but this is a movie you should watch beginning to end, with no interruptions. Otherwise, you will probably miss some important details. But let me tell you, I got sucked right in, all the way to a great ending which I won't spoil for you. It's just a wonderful movie. Believe me, you will be engrossed and entertained at the same time.",
266,3 June 2023,gregorybquinn,10, A revenge story with intelligence,"If this story of revenge was made now, it would have the requisite high body count wrapped in a mindless plot. Fortunately the movie was made in '73 with great actors, a great screenplay, a director who knew what he was doing and a score that revived interest in Scott Joplin's music.",
267,19 January 2018,zianimustafa,10, The Sting(1973),"The meeting of the crime with the drama in a comic template, it seems to you that the commercial commercial announcement only no more and no less, but there is a strange feeling in this film after I saw him but I thought it was a period and go away but after watching it again I realized that it is not just a comedy and crime And some drama, I discovered that it is a film that combines the beauty of performance and the quality of the output (George Roy, who received his film this Oscar) and the magnificence of the script and its simplicity. All these things attracted me to the film and even repeated viewing does not make you bored although the quality of such films may classify films She has lived her experience only once.",
268,11 January 2010,MajorTom123,10, A deceitful movie about deceit,"The year is 1936 and Johnny Hooker(Robert Redford) is a con-artist during the great depression. One day Johnny and his band unknowingly con a man running money for the vindictive, Irish, mob-boss Doyle Lonnegan(Robert Shaw). Presently a member of the band is found dead and Johnny flees to Chicago where he teams up with the legendary Henry Gondorff(Paul Newman) to sting Lonnegan and so avenge his friend.",
269,18 October 1999,Valek-5,10, Brilliant,"This is undoubtedly one of Redford's best movies.  I found everything about this movie spellbounding.  The twists, the suspense and the sheer brilliance and plotting of the sting itself.  The plot, the storyline, everything is amazing.  Something else about the movie is watching Robert Redford.  He was a lot younger then and a lot faster, but he hasn't changed all that much.",
270,17 February 2023,hornhiyo2000,10, Classic movie and definitely a top ten,All star acting crew. Great story and great plot. It makes my list of one of the ten best films I've seen of all,
271,1 June 2018,redrad-265-825348,9, Exceptional!,You will be hooked all the way to the end. You must watch it.,
272,6 August 2006,colbhoy,10, Superb,"This is just a superb film. The performances from Redford, Newman and Shaw in particular are outstanding and they are ably supported by an excellent supporting cast. This is not an easy film to follow, there are a lot of characters and a fairly intricate plot so repeat viewing is essential.",
273,28 February 2010,grafspee,10, Fabulous 1930's style movie with a flawless script of two con artists seeking revenge on a gangster for the death of a personal friend.,"You would never get tired of watching this exciting film with Paul Newman as (Henry Gondorff) and Robert Redford (Johnny Hooker) combining to form a partnership, to set up mean vindictive respectable style gangster Robert Shaw (Doyle Lonergan) with a well planned heist, for ordering the killing of well loved drifter Luther Coleman (played by Robert Jones), who conned one of Lonergan's runners out of several thousand dollars in illegal cash.

274,7 May 2010,cynthia-flynn,10," a caper, so well acted, so well written...you'll see","The pair was younger when they first hit movie gold together but never better as Paul Newman and Robert Redford head a tremendous cast in a story that deserves them. From the first glimpse of Newman, the phrase growing old gracefully lets you know he won't be outrunning anybody like his younger partner. The older trusting conman goes for one more for the sake of an old friend's widow. The set up roles out a cast of characters until the good guys and the bad guys get a complicated enough story going that you begin to believe, and it breaks your heart. But the cast, oh that cast, the secret signal, the costumes, the accents, the props and the girls on the carousel. Eileen Brennan is a gem, Harold Gould so perfect and Robert Shaw so hateful. ",
275,23 May 2000,JohnMcClane88,10, Nothing but Class all the way!,"This movie was an instant classic the second in came out! I seen this movie several times in the theater when in was released and maybe 20 times since, why in the world Redford and Newman have never made another movie together is beyond me. These two guys go together like Laurel and Hardy or Tracy and Hepburn, by now they should have made at least 3 more movies together. ",
276,26 January 1999,seamanm,10, One of very few films to deserve that overworked cliche - classic,"I believe that a movie can only be called a classic if it affects your life in some way. When I first saw the film in the Seventies in a cinema in England I was young and impressionable. It sure made an impression on me! The clothes are so cool, I got into Scott Joplin and I annoyed every new person I met by quoting Paul Newman, ""Nice to meet you kid, you're a real horses ass!"" I think I've grown out of the last trait, but I still love the movie.",
