0,24 April 2019,TheDragonTrader,10, More Western than 'The Western' itself,"In full silence, three mysterious men in long trench coats wait in a remote train station. Their faces have anticipation written all over them, even while the most interesting things they can find to do are toying with a fly, drinking water from a hat and cracking their fingers. A dog runs past. The windmill squeaks. The ticket vendor is locked away. The heath bounces off the wooden platform. The men sweat.",/

3,30 September 2017,Jeremy_Urquhart,10," Without a doubt, one of the best Westerns of all time","I won't claim to have the ability to say anything new about this movie. It's been around for nearly fifty years, and is widely regarded as not just one the best Spaghetti Westerns of all time, but one of the best Westerns full stop. And it's not hard to see why: an incredible soundtrack, strong performances from the entire main cast, some surprisingly good humour and funny one-liners, a few tense sequences, a well-told story that doesn't rely on excessive dialogue or exposition, and consistently amazing cinematography and direction throughout. At least half the frames in this movie would probably make good paintings- no exaggeration.",v
4,27 June 2007,thinker1691,9," ""When you've killed Four, it's easy to make it five.""","In the annals of western film lore, there are good and bad films. This is one of the finest. Because ""Once Upon A Time in The West"" is such a remarkable film, it is hard to define what makes it so memorable. The story centers on a beautiful former prostitute called Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) who arrives to assume the role of wife to a stubborn, crazy, red-headed Irishman with a dream. Waiting, instead is tragedy and 'Mr. Morton' who is a powerful, but ailing land grabbing baron (Gabriele Ferzetti) who desires to crush everything and everyone who stands in his way to reach the Pacific ocean with his railroad. To help him is an equally ruthless gunfighter named Frank (Henry Fonda; the success of this movie owes much to Fonda who plays a very convincing heavy) who has been removing obstacles for years and now targets the McBain family for death and that includes Jill. Unfortunately for Frank, he has accrued many enemies over the years with one particular, mysterious and deadly Harmonica playing stranger seeking revenge. Frank arranges for three of his best and fastest gun hands to meet and eliminate the stranger at the train-station. Joining the instrument playing stranger is an unpredictable, half-breed, renegade, who is a notorious gunfighter called 'Cheyenne.' ( Jason Robards ) The entire film is a triumph to the superb direction of Sergio Leone, who christens each major character with their own theme song. Each theme was created by Ennio Morricone and when the character makes an entrance, the theme prepares the audience for mood change, drama, action, and lifelong memories. Special guest appearances, by Woody Strode, Jack Elam, Keenan Wynn and Lionel Stander add to the classic nature of this excellent story. ****",i

8,21 January 2016,daxsir,10, Art,This is my fav film. It is more like watching a piece of art. The look is fantastic. The director does a perfect job. The acting is wonderful. The story is not the strongest ever but it should be watched to experience it. If your a film lover you can't fail but admire this film.Charles Bronson is the perfect broody loner. Henry Fonda surprises everyone by giving a strong performance as a bad guy. The close up of his eyes is stunning. The camera work and close ups have never been done better. The music is as good as anything you will find in a movie. Throw in the scenes when you first see Henry Fonda. The scene at the railway station which the water dripping on the hat. The sound of the spinning water tower. To me the closet movie to ART i have ever seen and i have seen a lot of films.,r
9,29 October 2008,bobsgrock,9, Leone goes a new route with the same results.,"With a style very much unlike that of his previous three Westerns, Once Upon a Time in the West takes a long time to tell this epic and powerful tale of three men all connected by their past and all destined to connect in the future. The acting is universally excellent with Fonda playing a very uncharacteristic part, but since he is such a great actor he has no problem filling the shoes of the merciless gunslinger, Frank. Jason Robards is great as the outlaw with a good heart, Cheyenne; and Charles Bronson is very Eastwood-like as a man known only as Harmonica with a mysterious past and a quick draw. The central character, though, is that of the beautiful Claudia Cardinale as Jill, a widow seeking revenge.",w
10,17 October 2015,framptonhollis,8, One of the Great Westerns,"This film is one of the greats! It is an epic western from the acclaimed filmmaker Sergio Leone. This is the first film of his that I've been able to see from the filmmaker, and I've heard that his film ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" is even better! But, as of now, I've only seen ""Once Upon a Time in the West"".",5
11,15 June 2017,Fella_shibby,9, A bit slow n tedious but still one of the best western film. Fonda was terrific.,"As a fan of Westerns, I saw this film many times in the early 90s. Saw this recently again on a DVD aft many years. The plot- Claudia Cardinale arrives at her ranch, to find that her husband has been murdered by hired gun Henry Fonda. Mysterious gunman Charles Bronson wants an appointment with Fonda. Bronson teams up with outlaw Jason Robards to help protect Cardinale n her ranch from Fondas evil intentions. There are long scenes where you get close shots of a person's face. Sergio Leone loves the stare-down, and you can see it in virtually all of his films. In this movie he allows the camera to linger longer than ever before. You get those quiet scoreless scenes where the natural sounds of the environment are greatly exaggerated. Leone's opponents take a long time to feel each other out before they act. One may find the long stretches of silence and inaction tedious n boring. Honestly, even i found some scenes boring, especially the opening scene. Henry Fonda is terrific. No one expected him to play such a ruthless and brutal killer. Bronson was decent but Jason Robards was much better with his tip on guys patting females bottom n the tip on don't get shot by a person who doesn't know to shoot. One of the best part bah the film was Ennio Morricone's score, especially the recurring harmonica music during the final closing fight. This is Morricone's best moment in a long, treasured career. I was surprised to know that the story was written by Dario Argento.",8
12,9 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, One of the biggest and boldest westerns you will ever see,"Although I have not seen all his films, I have yet to see a Sergio Leone film I hate. The movies I have seen of his are visually gorgeous with superb scores and interesting stories and characters. Once Upon a Time in the West is no exception. It is long and slow, but I think the film was deliberately paced like that.",9

Not quite, but still is AMAZING!","After the great success of the masterpiece ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" which perfectly finished the ""Dollars"" trilogy. Sergio Leone get bored with nothing to do, and decided to start another trilogy, the ""America"" trilogy with ""Once upon a time in the West"". That today is considered the best Western ever made in the history of cinema.",2
14,29 April 2018,mrmystery99,9, Just. Amazing.,"This one only gets better with each viewing. Leone's masterful storytelling and Morricone's crazy, beautiful, epic soundtrack; desperate, haunted faces that look like the barren landscapes the story is set in and a plot that unfolds with impeccable pacing to culminate in THE ultimate western finale. As in Leone's previous films, music isn't just used to add to the atmosphere but is essential to the story, or perhaps even more: Morricone's main musical theme plays the actual role of a (or rather: the) protagonist in the film. Anyone who thought that the so called ""Spaghetti Westerns"" were nothing but cheap, violent B-movies had to reconsider after seeing this film. It doesn't get any better than this: this is movie history; iconic, classic, unforgettable, epic - for this film, I just run out of words.",9
15,25 September 2019,bgkerfant-09664,10, A masterpiece,It's hard to believe this movie is from 1968. Very modern way of filming for the time. Sergio Leone gave time to each scene... something that new directors seem afraid to do... Great story about the last days of an era. Amazing music and the originality of linking a specific melody to each main character. And all these close-up to character's eyes... Just a wonderful movie.,8
16,5 September 2016,ptsj-music,10, A film any actor would just die to be in.,"The opening scene in this masterpiece from Sergio Leone is alone worth the 10 points. I would add another 10 if I could. To think that the three main actors from another work by the great master, ""The Good And The Bad And The Ugly"", Clint Eastwood, Eddie Wallach and Lee Van Cleef, said NO to appear as the three bad guys in the film's beginning, is just hilarious. Any actor would die just to be in this film. But these three guys were all thinking to highly of themselves, and didn't consider such a ""small role"" to be a great honor. It's not hard to understand Leone's meta intention to ask the three heroes to appear like that, but perhaps we all should thank them for refusing, because how much more epic didn't Jack Elam, Woody Strode and Al Mulock become after acting in this famous scene. They are simply perfect for it. Even more incredible is that Mulock committed suicide with his costume still on, and this way actually died, if not for playing a part in the film. His reason will forever be untold. ",3
17,23 June 2002,daniken,10, No western has ever come close to this one....and no western ever will.,"I can't quite find the words to even come close to describing the pure brilliance of this movie. When this movie was made, the western genre was dominated by the big hollywood studios. The western was taken by these studios and transformed into an opportunity to portray classic superheroes like John Wayne and Burt Lancaster in their fight against all sorts of smalltime crooks and outlaws in smalltime stories and smalltime towns. It was a genuine effort to portray 'Americanism', the American Way, along with a romanticised view of the west as 'Frontier country' where good always triumphed over bad and where the life was hard but honest. It was the American Way.",/
18,17 December 2019,RatedVforVinny,9, The rest is Western history.,"A true vision of the 'Wild West' frontier, from the Italian maestro Sergio Leone. All of his films apart from 'Duck, You Sucker!', are either perfect, or near perfect productions. I have a slight preference for the 'Dollars Trilogy' but this epic is simply magnificent. You just won't see a poor review to this one, as it's already a certified classic. Is highly ironic that 'A Fistful of Dollars' was so poorly received on its initial release but just four years later, the world had already bowed to the genius of both the director and especially Ennio Morricone (who scored the film, even before the first shot was filmed). A further masterstroke, was casting Henry Fonda, as the bad man and with a whole host of stars as the back up. Timeless in every aspect, coupled with some of the very finest gun-play.",?
19,9 September 2016,anaconda-40658,10, Once Upon a Time There Was Henry Fonda.,"Once Upon A Time in the West (1968): Dir: Sergio Leone / Cast: Charles Bronson, Henry Fonda, Jason Robards, Claudia Cardinale, Gabriele Ferzetti: Epic western that refers to the passing of events that shape our future despite forgotten souls. Charles Bronson plays a nameless gunslinger who is identified by the harmonica that pierces the night. He seeks vengeance upon the ruthless Frank, played with calm cruel delivery by Henry Fonda. The setting is Flagstone and the place is Sweetwater, land where water exists for the steam locomotives. Gabriele Ferzetti plays a crippled tycoon who wants this land and sends Frank to scare off those living there. Instead Frank kills the owner and his children and pins the blame on bandit Cheyenne, played by Jason Robards. Claudia Cardinale plays the new owner. She is a prostitute and new wife of the deceased owner. Cardinale brings out her grit teeth anger and her willingness to face intimidation. At three hours director Sergio Leone, a veteran in the genre presents standoffs and numerous gun fights including one aboard a moving train. Bronson is silent and determined to right the past. Fonda dominates with careful progressive evil. Robards is the sinner seeking redemption. Ferzetti is disabled but deceitful and ruthless. Cardinale is the pretty flower growing in poisonous soil and she faces the west living within the tragedy left by greed.

So, given that I have given very positive reviews for FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE and THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY, my being far from impressed with this film isn't because I dislike the genre or have it out for Mr. Leone! No, I have some legitimate reasons why I think the film is overrated--certainly very few of the IMDb users can honestly think this movie is one of the best 25 movies of all-time (despite its high IMDb score).",_

26,14 August 2008,SandeepLoyalka,8, Once Upon A Time...There Were Westerns!,"I first saw this film as a 20 year old in the late 80's on VHS & ended up thoroughly disappointed. Every scene seemed to stretch to near-infinity and the action was too sporadic for what I normally expected from a western. Now, however, things are different! I saw it again a few days ago after reading so many positive reviews & I must admit to pretty much being bowled over! 'Once Upon A Time In The West' is not your traditional shoot-em-up western. Its an acquired taste and I wouldn't be too far off the mark if I say that it resembles a dish with near-perfect proportions of ingredients, slow cooked over an intense fire. Director Leone doffs his hat to several classic westerns and ends up with a film thats greater than the sum of its parts. The lovely Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) arrives in the old west to join her new husband & family only to find them all brutally shot dead. Clues apparently point to the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards) though the dastardly deed has in fact been perpetrated by the magnificently evil Frank (Henry Fonda). Also in this lethal mix is a mysterious harmonica-playing stranger (Charles Bronson) with his own covert agenda. From the classic opening scene to the explosive climax, 'Once Upon A Time In The West' sucks the viewer into its vortex of emotions as layers upon layers are gradually peeled away revealing each characters true motivations. Featuring a stellar cast who have probably never been better, and a haunting, evocative score by maestro Ennio Morricone, 'Once Upon A Time In The West' is mandatory viewing for all film aficionado's. My only (small) complaint is the occasional self-indulgence displayed by Leone when he tends to give style precedence over narrative.",_
27,27 November 2014,JasparLamarCrabb,10, Something to do with death...,"Sergio Leone's greatest film and a strong contender for the best movie western ever made. Claudia Cardinale arrives at the desert home of her new husband only to find him & his children massacred. What ensues is a hideous game of cat and mouse between Henry Fonda (as the blackest black Bart imaginable) and the nameless & nearly silent Charles Bronson. Things are kept ambiguous as the viewer tries to figure out who is looking to save Cardinale's land and who is looking to steal it. To say Fonda is cast against type is an understatement. He's a conscienceless devil incarnate. Bronson, while ostensibly the ""good guy"" is no saint either. Jason Robards, in a role of pure irony, provides the moral compass for a cast of lurid characters. Leone proves to be a real artist with this film. The score, the editing, the cinematography and the pitch-perfect, wholly outrageous cast come together to produce a brilliant piece. Ennio Morricone's music score is rightly considered his finest and the stunning photography is by Tonino Delli Colli. Leone worked on the script with, among others, Bernardo Bertolucci & Dario Argento. The enormous supporting cast is excellent and includes Lionel Stander (frequently cut for some prints), Jack Elam, Woody Strode, Frank Woolf (in the pivotal role of McBain), Paolo Stoppa, Keenan Wynn, Fabio Testi, Don Galloway and the great Gabriele Ferzetti as an infirm yet ruthless railroad baron. Versions of this film reportedly run as long as 170 minutes though the US version available on DVD runs 165 and is considered complete.",u
28,29 June 2019,jsmith-74661,10, Some people just don't get this movie,"The slower pace is what makes this movie unique. The attention given to detail in terms of facial expressions, scenery, symbolism, and an operatic type musical score is what sets this move apart from other westerns. After seeing John Wick 3, I can honestly say that I long for less action and more substance. There is something to be said about the old ways. If you haven't seen this movie, give it a shot. It will be worth the 2 hours and 45 minutes.",r
29,25 November 2016,PetarNeo,10, So powerful and beautiful,"As lives of mysterious man, gang, women and assassin that is hired to kill her interweave in a great story that will keep you amazed till the very end. Violent and intense start of the movie promised a great things and fulfilled every one of it. As we are more and more drawn into a characters stories and purposes plot gets way twistier. Now things are starting to get serious and Harmonica starts to really take his place as main focus. Frank and Mr. Morton are the guys responsible for all trouble and they are trying to kill Jill as she is the only one left but in all that Harmonica and Cheyenne are determined to keep them away. In magnificent turnout of things comes the brilliant ending. Cheyenne is returning obviously wounded, Harmonica is waiting for Frank and Jill is seemingly worried about everything. Cheyenne went to train and had a great shootout with Mr. Morton and Frank has come and gets ready for duel with Harmonica. Jill is shaken while Frank tries to realize why Harmonica wants to meet him. In shootout we realize he couldn't save his brother and only thing left to him by Frank was harmonica. As Frank dies he got same harmonica back. Amazing turnout of events left with great ending. Claudia Cardinale as Jill is absolutely amazing, as she is beautiful, charming but at the same doesn't hide what she really is temptress and prostitute. Fonda as Frank is powerful, leader that is not afraid of anything and cold blooded murderer. Bronson as Harmonica was incredible, as he is quiet but dangerous, calm and in seeking revenge shows that he cares for things being right. Some absolutely incredible scenery and amazing directing of the movie. Music was probably one of the best ever in western movies as it has some weight but also creates all sort of emotions and creates amazing situations feelings. 4/4",v
30,4 March 2010,murtaza_mma,10, A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A piquant cocktail of style and substance in equal parts,"Once Upon a Time in the West (OUTW) is a piquant cocktail of style and substance in equal parts, potent enough to catapult the viewer into a whirlpool of incessant excitement transcending him beyond the usual realms of an adrenaline rush. Vintage Leone, OUTW is inarguably the best Western ever made and undoubtedly features amongst the very best works of cinema, period. Leone incredibly surpasses the brilliance of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (TGTBTU) with OUTW by blending his favorite theme of Greed with that of Revenge. The only thing that TGTBTU lacked was the presence of a strong female character and Leone more than makes up for it in OUTW. Its eccentric yet consummate plot revolves around a female protagonist, thereby revolutionizing the very tenets associated with the genre where machismo and chivalry had solely held sway, hitherto.

Although the pacing is deliberately slow, each scene is lovingly crafted in a unique stylish way which makes it a film like no other. The plot, concerning the development of a new railway line which cuts through the old western homes and towns, is a thinly-disguised metaphor of the end of the Old West and the ushering in of a new era, and the film is appropriately respectful and maudlin in tone.",
35,17 February 2014,Hey_Sweden,10, Cinematic brilliance from Sergio Leone.,"""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a truly epic scale Western, one of the best ever made; no other film from this genre can quite touch this one in this viewer's humble opinion. Virtuoso director Leone gives it an impressive sense of grandeur while also always remembering to concentrate on human emotions, as it takes its characters and audience on this dramatic (but never melodramatic) journey. It's subtly performed by all, with absolutely gorgeous widescreen photography. Leone dares to take his time telling this tale (scripted by himself and Sergio Donati, based on a story by Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci, and Leone), which might drive less than patient people up the wall, but the film offers plenty of rewards for those that stick with it. You really come to either care for or loathe these characters, waiting to find out how things will be resolved and what will become of everyone. Enhancing all of it is one of Ennio Morricone's loveliest ever scores; it's likely to bring a lump to your throat several times.",

Audiences around the world saw first hand the power and influence ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" bought to the world. It made a director famous, a young Clint Eastwood a household name and the Western more popular than it had ever hoped to be since the master works of John Ford. However, Sergio Leone bought with him a whole new sub-genre - a whole new style - and the Western had never looked darker and grittier. 'The Man With No Name' bought with it a whole new meaning to a heroic protagonist. There was no more good guy/bad guy, but only a survivalist type - ignorant and self indulgent, yet still moral and fair, tough and smart and damn good with a gun. The world fell in love with him and anticipated its sequels which only became more violent, atmospheric and realistic and gave the authentic true feeling of the West.",
38,8 January 2009,paul2001sw-1,5, There's a train a'coming...,"Most westerns are actually about the death of the old, wild, west; and 'Once Upon a Time in the West', with its story centred on the coming of the railroad, is no exception. One thing that Sergio Leone has done in this movie is to make a truly cinematic film: it's hard to imagine how the script read, as so much of the meaning is conveyed in the facial expressions of the actors or by Enrico Morricone's score - there's a balletic quality to Leone's work. Unfortunately, I found the music intrusive, the exaggerated grimacing of the characters merely comic, and the plot contrived, difficult to follow and arbitrarily bloody; I don't believe that even in the wildest west, six people would be killed outside a bar and everyone inside would just carry on drinking as if nothing had happened. Personally, I prefer Robert Altman's treatment of a similar storyline in 'McCabe and Mrs. Miller', a film that uses rather fewer of the conventions of the western, but which seems closer to life as a result.",
39,22 December 2010,mjneu59,9, the end of the Old West,"If Sam Peckinpah's Wild Bunch killed off the Western film, Sergio Leone's widescreen epic delivered a final eulogy in grand operatic fashion. This is the Wild West as only a European could see it: bigger than life, bolder than life, and much more savage than life. The plot, as suggested by the title, is a fairy tale amalgam of every Western movie myth (i.e. cliché) since Edwin S. Porter's 'Great Train Robbery', with beautiful widow Claudia Cardinale defending her homestead against an aggressive railroad tycoon. Included in the subsequent carnage is the usual cast of Spaghetti Westerners: the enigmatic, nameless anti-hero (Chuck Bronson, replacing Clint Eastwood); the scruffy desperado sidekick (Jason Robards Jr., providing welcome comic relief); and an entire secondary cast of swarthy Italian gunmen, most of whom are killed off before the closing credits. Leone toned down the often surreal amorality of his Man-With-No-Name trilogy, but in a stroke of brilliance cast Henry Fonda against his image as the sadistic mercenary hired by the railroad to ""clear obstacles"" (including a young boy, blown apart at point blank range) from the path of the train.",
40,30 December 2010,Red-Barracuda,10, A beautiful western,"Once Upon A Time In The West is no ordinary western. Despite the non-descriptive title, this is a film that redefined the genre. With his dollars trilogy, director Sergio Leone proved that he was the master of the spaghetti western; with Once Upon A Time he transferred the conventions of that genre – the operatic sense of drama, the nihilism, extreme close-ups, epic widescreen photography, Ennio Morricone music and moral ambiguity – into Monument Valley, the setting of the traditional American western. The result is pretty unforgettable. Leone tells a simple story via images. Looks, as opposed to dialogue, are used to convey meaning wherever possible. When characters do speak, their lines are significant. Every bit of dialogue is considered, no one talks unnecessarily. This combined with the phenomenal cinematography and unforgettable music results in a sort of operatic minimalism. The western has never been depicted so artistically.",

I was disappointed. On the one hand, I could see that it had a lot of good stuff in it, but there was something lacking. As I found out later, what was lacking was all the footage that had been cut out of the movie for its release in America. It was not until the movie came to television, and I saw much of the additional material (with some stuff edited out for the usual reasons), that I realized what a great movie it was. Even then it was not until somewhat later that I saw the restoration, which included even more material. Unfortunately, those who restored this movie messed up on the music at the end, which is hard to understand, because it would have been simple to do it right. I guess we Americans just were not destined to see this movie in its perfect form, and certainly not in a movie theater (at least not where I live).",

To reveal any more of the plot would not do the film justice because part of its charm is how gradual the exposition is; only as it slowly progresses do we begin to get clues as to what is motivating all the characters. This might sound a little frustrating, and at times it is, but there is a lot to like about how we are simply thrown into the middle of the story (as clueless as the widow is), forced to observe these characters and see what makes them tick before coming to understand their actions. This is an inventive film beyond its storytelling approach though with much quotable dialogue (""you brought two too many""), imaginative shooting scenes (a boot!) and several impressive graphic/audio matches, most notably a speeding bullet cut against an approaching train. The conclusion of the movie is perhaps too sentimental for its own good and the very deliberate pacing of the project is not going to please everyone, but it is amazing how great a film Leone and his team manage to spin here with such an unconventional plot unraveling approach.",

Along more than ten minutes, there is a disturbing lack of action, with minor details being presented: a fly, a drop of water. Then, Harmonica (Charles Bronson, maybe in his best performance on the screen) arrives and there is a short but spectacular dialog between the characters. The next scene, the viewer sees a family being massacred by Frank (Henry Fonda, with a stunning performance). Then we have a long shot and panoramic scene in a station, with the arrival of Jill (Claudia Cardinale, with such a remarkable  beauty and performance). And last but not the least, there is a scene in a road bar, where we are introduced to the character of Cheyenne (Jason Robard, in a spectacular performance). The introduction of this four main characters is slow, but very well presented. And this will be the tonic of this film: slow, but very well constructed scenes and characters. The story was written by Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci, therefore it does not need any further explanation. All supported by the magnificent, wonderful, stunning, marvelous, fantastic soundtrack of Ennio Morricone. Another masterpiece of Sergio Leone.

57,6 August 2019,axelhansson-84896,10, The work of a maestro,"After completing the ""Dollars"" trilogy, Sergio Leone was initially reluctant to direct another western. But when Paramount tabled an offer he couldn't refuse, he went on to make this poetic, utterly compelling tale that still stands out as one of the most elaborate movies the genre has derived. Themes of greed, vengeance and haunted pasts all intertwine to form a grand and poignant homage to the whole western genre.
While the ""Dollars"" trilogy and most prominently ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" remain the quintessential western movies, OUATITW takes the genre one step further, into a less exploited territory. Whereas Leone's previous work has more of an adventurous feeling to it, OUATITW is pervaded by a more dooming atmosphere. Unlike most other Westerns it doesn't have the typical hero, but relies more on a sentimental basis, personified by the tormented Harmonica. Overall this movie is less extravagant than the ""Dollars"" films, and more subtle and subdued, which in the end results in a more mature and realistic approach to the genre. Equipping the characters with different backgrounds also benefits the story's depth and intricacy.
The cast I superb, led by a chilling Henry Fonda. Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale also provide memorable performances, as well as Charles Bronson as the vindictive, harmonica-playing stranger whose incentive is a mystery to everyone but himself. Everything about the movie, how the shots are executed, how the sets are devised, how light affects the scenes: everything is done with the outmost meticulosity.
One of the film's most salient features is it's astonishing direction. Leone employs the same camera techniques as in his earlier films, only even more extensively. The shots are even longer, the close-ups even more extreme. Simultaneously he refrains from any attempt of moving forward too promptly. On the contrary, he uses the slow build-up to create tension that surges the viewer into the happenings. This is particularly notable in the opening scene of the movie. We see three men coming into view at a railway station, and apart from the squeaking cry from a windmill it is completely silent. For minutes nothing of importance happens, and without any music and without any dialogue the tension increases as it becomes evident that the men are waiting for something. Without any words being uttered we know something is about to happen. After minutes of shots between the three men and the station, the viewer is completely absorbed into the movie. This type of storytelling is a rare, if not nonexistent instance in movies of today.
The final essential piece of the movie is the music. Composer Ennio Morricone, the man behind the famous ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" soundtrack, produces yet again a haunting, perfectly adequate score. Probably it was his ability to compose iconic western music that mad Leone use him over and over again. Morricone utilizes different soundtracks depending on which character currently occupies the center of the stage. Bronson's eerie, desolate cry of a harmonica greatly reflects his lonely and reserved personality, while Robards' more upbeat, clever tune perfectly suits the coarse and cunning gunslinger.
After watching this you can do nothing but conclude that this is one big, immaculate masterpiece. If you haven't watched it, watch it. It is definitely worth the time.",

(Fat chance.) The director, Sergio Leone, gives us a long sequence in which Elam has a duel of wits with a fly that insists on landing on his chin or his lip.

Amazingly shot working hand in hand with Ennio Morriconne's incredible trademark score with meticulous attention to detail, especially with costumes and sets. The ensemble cast of Charles Bronson, Claudia Cardinals, Jason Robards and Henry Fonda as the diabolical Frank is awesome as well. The storytelling is solid and done in Sergio's innovative style. The plot deals with corruption, murder and revenge and gives the sense of the desolation and grit of the American west. This is much darker in tone and a completely different take on the great John Ford westerns that influenced Leone . Overall for cinophilles, Once Upon A Time In The West is a must watch. There has not been a film that was anything quite like it before and hasn't been seen since.

Sergio Leone made extreme close-ups the dominant shots to explain character - and a look into Frank's eyes (played by Henry Fonda), who was deliberately cast against his usual character in ""Once Upon a Time in the Wild West"", makes it perfectly clear why. There's no need for lengthy dialog if a capable director can do so much more with style alone. And of all around brilliant visuals in Leone's Westerns there is no shortage, no doubt about that. If the widescreen scenery is as grand, deep and epic a director can even deliberately allow the weight of silence to descend on the viewer and let the image speak for itself.",

Yeah sure the dollars movies were westerns, but they satirised American horse operas in Leone's unique tongue-in-cheek style. Duck You Sucker is not really a western. It's a buddy actioner which criticised war, patriotism and social hierarchy. Finally we have Once Upon A Time In America. Something of a labour of love for Leone, this depression set crime epic would be an object of obsession for the final part of his life. With West, dear old Sergio was merely tipping his hat to his inspiration, the American western. A love letter to Hollywood directors like John Ford and Howard Hawks, West is comprised of subtle references to several American westerns. However, there is only one variation. With these references, Leone has taken the conventions of the Hollywood western and reversed them, giving birth to mind blowing authenticity.

The slow scenes here are used to great effect to construct an impression of a desolate, anarchist wasteland with plenty of masculine bandits who really rule the land. Every little moment has its purpose - the playing of a harmonica, the buzzing of a fly, the wind in the desert and more.

That is, number one: the brilliant, brilliant soundtrack that adds feeling; raw emotion and atmosphere as well as number two: editing and shot composition which differs between long, wide angled long shots to the gritty close up of the face for certain reactions and objects for certain atmosphere. Many things have been said about how brilliant the film is and in terms of the genre, this genre film is usually considered one of if not the pinnacle itself of the Western. But whereas the typical American western might include John Wayne or some other such hard bodied American taking on a role of 'honest as they come guy' who gets caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time, Once Upon a Time in the West is a slower and less-obvious film that somewhat ignores these conventions. Therefore it is a shame that I liked it rather than loved it once it had ended.",
77,11 May 2010,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, Leone knew how to shoot and cut... he was an expert at both,"Right from the very opening moments to the last, this is perfectly crafted. You immediately realize that you are in skillful hands. This builds up tension masterfully, including in the first minute(!). The use of sound(and silence, lest we forget) is incredible, with spot-on use of the exaggerated audio produced by real objects. Morricone brings to this an astonishing score, with distinct themes(with electric guitar as well as softer instruments) and sweeping pieces, all impeccably well-composed. The editing and cinematography, with effective reveals, beautiful sets and nature, heavy use of close-ups and a sincere focus on atmosphere and mood(whilst also delivering amazing gunfights) help make this downright operatic. No, this isn't in a hurry like more recent movies, and there is not an action sequence every ten minutes... however, if you find a single frame of this ""boring"" or anything of the sort, then I would think that your attention span is simply insufficient, and I urge you to attempt to improve it and give this another chance. Other than being contrarian, I can't imagine why one wouldn't find this timeless and relevant; it's about the future(not in the science fiction way), development, love, and personal dreams... the things life itself are made of, what we all cherish most. All of this, without any instances of sentimentality, preachiness or, at 160 minutes, any wasted time. It fits so much plot(note that viewers are expected to piece some of it together) into that time without coming off as rushed and avoiding overwhelming the audience. The pacing is beyond reproach, with a gradual speed that lets all of the events unfold. Every scene is done exactly right, and they fit together with impressive precision. The sense of humor is great. Costumes are beyond reproach. Everyone in this is a perfect casting choice, right down to the least seen extra; their faces add an immeasurable amount to this, especially in the cases of the goons and the three male leads(R.I.P., truly sorry to lose you). Robards is so ridiculously charming that I could remember him from Enemy of the State(yes, for as briefly as he appears in that), Fonda plays against expectations with an absolutely chilling result, and Bronson, I believe, started doing his thing, what he's so famous for, in this very picture. Do I even need to point out that this is among the (spaghetti) Westerns(it references the classics of the genre, by the way) that constructed our idea(then and current) of what macho is? Compare it. The short lines, ""cool-ness"", their behaviour(I will put no details here). Cardinale is *stunning*, and, as goes for the others(not merely the leads), an excellent actor. She is an early strong female character(that all of them are marvelously developed begs mentioning), too. Dialog is well-written. There is plenty of violence that gets brutal and contains blood here and there, occasional sensuality and a little moderate language in this, and it is disturbing at times. The Special Collector's Edition DVD comes with a rather interesting and informational commentary track(by directors, including the ""Johns"" Carpenter and Milius, an author of a book on Sergio and a film historian), four featurettes, two stills galleries and a trailer.

The languid pacing only accentuates the meticulously presented scenes and the Ennio Morricone score is powerful, poignant and haunting. Each major character has his own musical theme. Henry Fonda's character has a menacing and jarring score which chills and thrills me every time I hear it (I bought the soundtrack too!). Fonda as Frank is the ""coldest villain in screen history"" as I have read in other reviews and was cast against type in this film. When the camera pans up into his passionless blue eyes early in the movie, one sees what a brilliant piece of casting it was to have him as the villain.

80,7 March 2007,drystyx,1," Disjointed, horribly directed waste of time","Sergio Leone will one day, maybe fifty years from now, replace Mister Wood on every critic's list as the worst movie director of all time. He'll at least make the top ten. At least Wood could make a story interesting, at least one character you might care about, and didn't have the gigantic Leone budget. Leone fails on every level. The story is very disjointed. It's mostly just comically unrealistic gunplay, with some guys being able to kill minor characters from great distances, but unable to kill major stars that should be easier. That's nothing new, but the circumstances are quite laughable. The story is just killing after killing, to take land away, and it follows sadist Henry Fonda, and his opponents, Charles Bronson and Jason Robards. Jack Elam appears in what amounts to a cameo. The characters aren't much to like. Bronson makes little jokes like an underdog hero of a Japanese movie, but the plot is so bad, and the characters so unlikable, you don't really care. To be fair, they aren't as unlikable as other spaghetti Westerns, but they don't have any appeal, either. You struggle to watch the film. You won't be able to do in one sitting.

The character played by Henry Fonda thrills me every time I watch this film and the music that is associated to the character again chilling. The character that Henry Fonda plays is Frank and he is ice cold. Henry's eyes are such a vivid blue as the camera pans around on him. Just mesmerising.",

This movie is a good example of why Sergio Leone was a genius as a director. There is a good dose of mystery sometimes. In the beginning, you are not able to understand why each character is motivated to do what they do. Mysteries are revealed throughout the piece, when four main characters are completely developed in a very simple screenplay. Frank is a murder of an entire family, Cheyenne is a gangster with a conscience (chasing Frank by what he had done), Jill is the widow which survived since she was in New Orleans, and Harmonica is a mysterious outsider in town with incredible shooting abilities and guess what! He plays harmonica when he should talk and he talks when he should play, giving a dose of thriller and humor for this incredible character.",

Brilliantly filmed, with careful attention for the smallest detail and performed by gifted actors and actresses in not so obvious roles. Straight from the slow and clammy opening credits sequence, you notice that this is an epic that will require your full attention and one that'll automatically provoke great feelings of respect and admiration. A cowboy's struggle with a fly is portrayed like it is a devastating battle, guided by unnatural noises on the background that put an extra emphasis on the unbearably tropic climate. This is the merciless West and you need your eyes and ears focused at all times to avoid trouble with someone more powerful than you.

95,7 July 2020,maue-19674,10, Leone's Western Masterpiece - one for the ages,"There are some films that simply leave you stunned the first time you watch them - that is EXACTLY how I felt when I first viewed Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West'. I had seen his 'Dollars Trilogy' with Eastwood - and loved his 'style' languid story-telling, massive close-ups and (of course) Morricone's timeless music. So when I approached this Film I was expecting something similar but - in many ways - THIS is Leone's greatest work. Everything about the Film evokes a melancholy nostalgia for a lost 'West'. Ennio Morricone's peerless score underpins this and drives your emotions through the film - indeed the Music was written FIRST - Leone played it on the sets so that the Actors could hear the atmosphere he was looking for. The fantastic set-pieces - the massacre of the McBain Family to reveal Henry Fonda's soulless gun 'Frank', the arrival of Harmonica at the train stop to face three adversaries, Jill's arrival at Sweetwater - all had me utterly spellbound.
The performances are simply perfect - Bronson was never better, with superb support from Fonda and Robards as Cheyenne but it is Claudia Cardinale's Jill that is the heart and centre of this story. We see this through her eyes and recognise that this 'West' - with the coming of the railroad - will not last long.
Leone and his fellow writers - Donati, Argento and Bertolucci - could have simply delivered a basic Western screenplay but, to his undying credit, Leone wanted to tell a story of not only the Myth of the West but it's passing. In doing so, he crafted a Film so unique and cinematic that it repays repeated viewings and just improves every time a see it.
I remember my first viewing of this masterpiece - as the credits rolled up to Morricone's beautiful music I simply stared at the screen stunned and said to myself ""did I just see that?"" And I longed to watch it again.....this is one for the ages and one of my absolute favourite films.",

A masterpiece on every level, it is easily the best film ever made by director Sergio Leone  fine praise indeed for a man whose other works include the likes of The Good, The Bad And The Ugly and Once Upon A Time In America. What makes the film doubly impressive is the way that it moves at its own uniquely languid pace, with the camera pausing on sweaty faces and vast empty landscapes for seemingly indefinite periods of time. These frequent lingering pauses  almost certain to provoke tedium in any other film  here take on an absorbing significance and fascination. Although the initial reaction is that much time seems to be wasted during C'era Una Volta Il West, on reflection one realises that every frame is beautifully composed and makes some kind of contribution to the overall atmosphere of this most atmospheric of films.

While the storyline itself isn't complex, it's characters are compelling, rich and intriguing as Sergio Leone delivers what most western's do without, suspense. Jill Mcbain(Claudia Cardinale)a prostitute travelling from New Orleans to start a fresh life on the frontier with her awaiting husband, arrives only to find him slain, as locals gather to offer their condolences. Leoni's greatest weapon in this movie is his foresight to cast against type. Henry Fonda, not known for villainous streak, plays Frank, the muscle used by the railroad to enforce it's dominance across the desolate wastelands of America's West. As good as Fonda is, it's Charles Bronson's movie. He may prefer the sound of a harmonica over his own voice, but what he lacks in dialect, he more than makes up for with a quick draw. This is more than a movie, it's an experience in my mind, a piece of history, as the west is portrayed as a haunting brutal land that discriminates against absolutely no-one. 10 outta 10 guaranteed!!!",
113,7 January 2007,Ismaninb,4," Leone's worst, as far as I have seem them","In my opinion Sergio Leone is one of the best directors ever. But Once upon a time in the West is his failure. Whenever I watch a Leone movie, I am prepared for a slow pace - and am surprised that it is actually steady. OutW really is too slow. There is no typical Leone tension build up. The final shoot out is a meager copy of the two previous ones with Lee van Cleef involved. Henry Fonda is not a convincing villain like Van Cleef and Volonte (Fonda - and Leone - took revenge though with My name is Nobody). Charles Bronson is not underacting like Clint Eastwood - Bronson is simply not acting. Wallach is missing - I cannot even remember what kind of character Cheyenne is. There is no character development. There are no tricks, black humour, double and triple crosses. In fact there is hardly a story. I am happy to learn, that I am not the only one to prefer the Dollar movies. I also prefer all the movies Leone directed after this on, as far as I have seen them (the most). In fact I have been thinking of rating OutW with a 1. But that is not fair. The opening scene with the three hit men waiting for the train is absolutely brilliant, with Leone's typical eye for the detail.",
114,19 September 2020,deloudelouvain,7," Sergio Leone, king of the Spaghetti Westerns","Sergio Leone is the king of the spaghetti westerns, that's a fact. Almost everyone knows his movies, or has seen at least one, that is if you're of a certain age. His movies get really high ratings on IMDb, even though I don't think they're all that good. For instance For A Fistfull Of Dollars (1964) has a weak story, yet it still scores really high. The same for Once Upon A Time In The West, great acting and cinematography (certainly for that time), but the story isn't that great. That said I still enjoy this movie, just for the great soundtrack of Ennio Morricone, the sublime tension building between the different characters (nothing beats those face offs in Leone's westerns), or the superb close-ups of the villains. Like all his other movies it's a very long movie, and maybe sometimes the shots are just a bit too long and not to everybody's taste but to me it adds to the tension building. I don't think this one is his best though, I preferred For A Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly (1966), but that's only my opinion. The acting was good, with a young Charles Bronson, Henry Fonda and the always stunning looking Claudia Cardinale. If there's one typical thing in Sergio Leone's movies is the amount of bad guys that all add to great visual close-ups. His casting is just really good, his way of shooting those images even better. But what strikes me the most with his early movies is just the quality of the images, for that time it was just great cinema and for that alone all his movies are worth watching.",

Almost 3 hours long, Sergio Leone's ""masterpiece"" loses focus most of the time and doesn't seem to go in any particular direction.The scenes are way too long and most of them don't even create tension as better Leone films so greatly do. The haunting score by Morricone is good and Henry Fonda as the baddest cat in the west is also very intriguing. The movie is propelled by the motivation of Harmonica, which we always want to discover. That being said, the shootout between Fonda and Bronson is awesome, with flashbacks revealing the nature of Harmonica's motivations. But after that, the movie should have ended quickly, for it deserved a climactic ending, at least.

Sergio Leone seized the traditional western and, helped by his scriptwriter Dario Argento, the future reference of giallo and baroque slaughter on large screens, enriched it with emphatic approach and humorous disenchantment. In fact, he builds a myth with modest elements - an organ mouth, a blue-eyed glance, long coats - and introduces lyricism and immoderation, to sublimate the manners of this specific spectacle. The daring of realization - inverted or encircling shot - and artistic choice (Henry Fonda becomes a tough guy) express an authentic will to break the common rules, in order to confer sensible density on his characters and an aesthetic energy on his scenery. Paradoxically, this glittering vision of Redemption, which was hesitating between homage and parody, belongs now to the classics.

The interesting thing to me in the credits is the story by credits for Sergio Leone that he shares with Dario Argento and, in particular, Bernardo Bertolucci. It's documented that Bertolucci was responsible for the idea of making the main character a woman, but the film has a certain structural feel that reminds me of some of Bertolucci's own work like 1900 and The Last Emperor.

Just 'stark' arid desert. (Perhaps 19th Century American western fauna could find nutrition in cacti?)

Claudia Cardinale stars as a beautiful widow trying to hold onto her hot piece of real estate in the booming Old West, trailed by a cold-hearted hit-man. As photographed by Tonino Delli Colli, the picture looks splendid, though this screenplay from Leone and Sergio Donati (working from an original treatment by Leone, Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci) is thin, and Leone ultimately relies on the sweep and the scope to propel his story, which covers familiar territory.

There are many memorable scenes with Fonda, and Bronson running around in cowboy hats with other rugged character mixed in with music and a rugged landscape. Sergio Leone made Western's which looked dirty and real. The Bad: Two and half hours is way too long. Many scenes added little or dragged the story down, and should have been cut. A few less artistic scenes would have helped the story. Too many plot twists, and sub stories which confused the viewer. The Ugly: Memorable scenes and performances made the film watchable. Regrettably the films elongated length, bad sub-story scenes and attempts at humor kills Once Upon a Time in the West strong points. The opening and strong acting gives the film a nine, but the extra baggage drops the film to a 3. I give Once Upon a Time in the West a six out of ten.",
133,17 February 2015,chrisart7,3, lumbering and interminable,"I recently purchased a double DVD package of ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and re-watched this film after having revisited the ""Dollars"" trilogy...and what a comedown. First the positives: a lovely score from Ennio Morricone (especially the ""Jill""/Claudia Cardinale theme), gorgeous photography, sets, locations, lighting, and some decent (but not terribly great) acting - Gabriele Ferzetti probably comes off best in his role. You know you're in trouble when the very last bit in the documentary extras is a quotation of Sergio Leone worriedly admitting to co-scripter Bernardo Bertolucci that he had set the pace far too slow when filming the opening sequences, and that the ensuing film would probably be five hours long as a result. It was almost three, and it barely moves along at all. The plot is paper thin and could have easily been filmed in 90 minutes. Perhaps then the much-needed forward momentum and suspense would be in place. As it is, the film has far too protracted silences which do not advance it at all.",

141,18 March 2008,waynec50,9," Great Movie, Acting, Direction and Music","""Once Upon a Time in the West"" has been recently released in a special 2 disc set, and it's about time. The movie gets better every time you watch it. Sergio Leone's directing is incredible, the pacing and suspense are unparalleled. He squeezes every speck out of every scene without dragging them out. His choice of Henry Fonda as the bad guy and his sales pitch to get him are well worth it. At the time, nobody could imagine Fonda as a bad guy. Charles Bronson is perfect as the enigmatic ""Harmonica"", bringing his craggy face, economical delivery and a sense of decency to the role that's hard to imagine anyone else could bring. Jason Robards portrays Cheyenne with dash and layers of larceny, chivalry, humor and ruthlessness that bring this complicated character to life. Claudia Cardinale is, of course, beautiful, and gives Jill McBain different aspects, former lady of the night, apparent gold-digger, disappointed and too soon widow, clever seeker of the truth of her husband's dream, used and abused woman and finally friendly hostess for Cheyenne and the railroad workers. The supporting cast is terrific. Paolo Stoppa is sarcastic, crusty but also concerned for Jill when they find her new family murdered. Lionel Stander is great as a saloon keeper who engages Jill in conversation, and when it's interrupted, picks up as if only seconds had elapsed rather than several tense minutes. Jack Elam and Woody Strode are cold eyed killers. Keenan Wynn has a nice cameo as the sheriff and auctioneer. The score is majestic, gritty and perfect, the individual themes convey more than dialogue could. The final showdown resolves a mystery surrounding ""Harmonica"" and Frank. The final scene as Cheyenne dies and Jill brings water to the rail gangs is a neat summation of the West that will never be the same again. Harmonica's observation that man is a vanishing race being replaced by soulless machines and corporations is an apt eulogy for the men living on the edge of the law. Just about a perfect movie.",
142,6 February 2004,Quinoa1984,10, Maybe Leone's second best behind GB&U- sophisticated weaving of techniques from past westerns into an near-mythic treatment...,"Sergio Leone's the master of the spaghetti western- hard to refute that- and with Once Upon a Time in the West he goes for taking the skills he formed in the 'Dollars' trilogy (inspired by the likes of John Ford) into a stylistically complex work.  The story as well (by Leone, horror director Dario Argento, and Bernardo Bertolucci) slips the lines together without a flaw.  The four main characters- the suave, quiet Harmonica (Charles Bronson), the determined and sexy Jill (Claudia Cardinale), veteran outlaw Cheyenne (Jason Robards), and the worn, chilling  hired-killer Frank (Henry Fonda)- each get enough screen time by themselves or with each other to get the story going along, with the interweaving perfectly in sync.  And Leone's in luck- his actors all turn in top shelve work, with Bronson proving himself to be cool on par with Eastwood, Cardinale highly formidable as the first female lead in a Leone film, and Fonda creating one of his most memorable works.  Fonda's Frank draws you like no other actor could have in the first scene he appears.

Still central female actress Cardinale and composer Morricone are still alive. But we can also be grateful for what all of them left us. I can somehat see why this western here is still so much later appreciated by so many as it sits comfortably in the imdb top 250, top50 even. Many maybe consider it the second best western ever made behind Good, Bad and Ugly, but maybe it is not too good to compare these two because while there are parallels, there are also significant differences. The other was set against Civil War with honestly this war not having too much of an impact on the movie and the protagonists. Here the setting is the expansion of the railroad through America and how greedy railroad tycoons and their henchmen are not scared of blackmail, extortion and murder in order to get what they want, even if honestly the guy with the crudges is just a leech and his motivation to see the Pacific Ocean is not entirely vile. But Frank's is. Still I felt he was a bit weak to be the main antagonist, even if Henry Fonda is a talented actor without a doubt. But come on he needed saving by Harmonica from his own men, he did not show up to the early meeting, he knows nothing about the power of money and of course there would be no way he could survive a gunfight against our hero. Speaking of the latter, the actor is Charles Bronson and while I have not seen him in anything else there is no denying the great screen presence he has here. His first two scenes when he plays the harmonica felt a bit strange, so I needed a bit to get used to it, but eventually I appreciated it. It also worked really nice as the soundtrack for the film which was great anyway (Morricone!), so the soundtrack was part of the film itself. Smart move there. And the final explanation scene why specifically a harmonica in the flashback to his youth was really nice too with him giving the harmonica back in the now then to the guy who killed his father. Although I think the age difference between Harmonica and Frank was maybe a bit too big in the flashback. Bronson looked older than he was anyway. But also how he quotes the names of the killed when asked for his name was nice as if he was some revenge angel to them.",

It's able to enhance everything in a way that is beyond words, always perfectly touching the emotions that the scene is trying to convey.

The creaking of the windmill, the fly on Elam's face, the inevitable shoot-out are all fantastically done.

180,30 November 2008,Dr_Coulardeau,10," Good, better, best, bestest !!","Sergio Leone is unique in his field, and particularly in the western genre. He was in his fourth year of spaghetti western, let's say in full swing, in this film. You know it is Sergio Leone by several elements that do not tell a lie. The music always has the same texture, the same taste, the same sonorities, with the eternal harmonica. Then the landscape, the sunshine, the light, the vegetation and of course practically no fauna, and in this one, not even a snake. Hardly a few horses, a couple of partridges, or whatever, and a pair of chickens. Nothing to brag about. Sergio Leone is concentrating anyway on the human animal and there the menagerie is by far diverse and grotesque enough. Then the economy of the dialogue is also typical because Sergio Leone never uses one word too many when he can do without any word at all. The silences are long and so meaningful that you must be blind not to hear the resounding sense of that emptiness. Then the few words that are actually pronounced become so powerful in their scarcity and rarity that you definitely have to be deaf not to see the subtlety of that sound track. Those are the most significant traits of Sergio Leone's style. And this film is the acme of that style. The plot itself innovates in the subject, that is to say in who the thieves are. In this case some railroad contractor who wants to get rid of some settler who has bought a big chunk of land on the very way where the railroad has to go and who has a contract that allows the railroad to go through for nothing if the station is built before the train can come. You can then imagine the intricacies of the action between several gangs and tribes and bands of good and bad men, bad and good beings, and all the nuances, hues and shades in between. The best detail of course comes at the end when the main bad guy realizes who the one who has just destroyed him is. Don't expect me to tell you. You have to watch the film till the very last five minutes to finally understand. Enjoy it.

I am referring to Bronson's Harmonica recalling the incident that brought about his revenge for Fonda's Frank character: I am sure I will be corrected if this is in error but there are four total flashbacks where we get more information each time through a blurry recollection until in the final instance Fonda has the crystal clear flashback and we see Frank much younger committing his unspeakable crime. This fourth and final flashback clarifies to the villain and the film audience the motivation for the payback just as he finally ""bites the dust"". If you like Bronson here seek out the hard to find Rider on the Rain - not a Western but I think filmed in the same time period by a different director: At this time we can see Bronson is becoming this multi-national everyman hero that exploded his popularity.

That said, his Once Upon a Time in The West is by and large a dismal, overblown failure of equally titanic proportions.  The acting is self-conscious not mannered, the details other than the opening sequence at the train station (brilliant in absolutely every regard, he should have quit when Charles Bronson says, ""You've brought two too many."")are largely uninspired and the music is nothing short of grating.

I liked the main casting, even enjoying Fonda doing Eastwood. You can see how Bronson became a superstar after this. Some soaring magnificent orchestrations and endlessly beautiful scenes... but oh, that slow pace really did get to me. An irritating magnificent western masterpiece.

Leone's epic western Once Upon A Time In The West remains one of the greats of all Westerns, the last great one in fact.

196,10 April 2005,southernmissfan,10, A Western Masterpiece,"In 1964, a small time director named Sergio Leone, unknown in America, directed A Fistful of Dollars and would subsequently change the way the world looked at 'westerns' forever. Up until this time, westerns consisted of the perfect hero, who was invincible and always did the right thing; a knight who traded in his shining armor for cowboy boots. It was the duty of this morally outstanding superman to take on the despicable villain, complete with a black hat, save the girl, and ride off into the sunset. Then came Leone, who gave us stories and characters that were not black and white, good and evil, but rather a grey reality. Leone's protagonist, the so-called 'man with no name' (as played by Clint Eastwood), did not always do the right thing. He was not the noble sheriff or marshal, but instead a mysterious stranger looking for a buck. In fact, in the third film The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, there is only a thin line separating the 'good' from the 'bad' and 'ugly'. Leone's revolutionary westerns did not stop there. His cinematography would become his calling card- beautiful panoramic shots of big country combined with extreme close-ups, what has been described as using the faces of the characters as second landscapes. Throughout his career, Sergio Leone would work with one of the greatest composers of the 20th century, Ennio Morricone. Morricone's use of harmonicas, chimes, and amplified guitars (just to name a few) along with natural sounds, such as the creaks of a windmill, would become a trademark of not just Leone, but the entire Italian 'spaghetti' western sub-genre. It is in 1968 that Leone would direct a new project, leaving the ""man with no name' series behind. This new project, Once Upon a Time in the West, would combine the traditional western with the groundbreaking work in his previous three films to create an epic masterpiece, true cinematic art.",

But on the 2nd viewing a year later I got what he meant and it keeps getting better every time. I'm not a Western fan per say but the Leone revisionist westerns hit home with me and this is more of a bittersweet fable than a straight cowboy story as most, as far as I'm concerned anyway. Stunning photography and landscapes abound in this retro western.
Fonda takes a stunning turn as a pure evil gunslinger leader. Cardinale rivals any of the sex kittens of the day like Raquel Welch, Jane Fonda and Bardot with her beehive wig and sparse flowing wardrobe. She commands the lead as a strong willed, intelligent, independent woman not afraid to let her casual feminine wiles loose in an age where being seen and not heard was the norm. Bronson's is at his hard faced and subtle best, rivalling only Eastwood in cool & dangerous attitude. Robards is a much welcome calm relief in all the stare down confrontations within the film. 
Morricone's score is breath taking in scope and infusing the film with a strong fable-like theme as well as separate and memorable scores for each of the four lead characters.
Few directors can use long, slow scenes and successfully build up the tension rather than bore the audience. Leone is but the few who succeeds at this and it is this technique which became his trade mark.",

The pioneer family is symbolically eliminated by the corporatist world. It's all about making profit and only a ruthless and heartless person like Frank could have accepted to kill a family for greed, what no other outlaw from John Ford's movies would have done, except a Native. The child was killed as a continuation of the McBain threat and Jill's sentence wouldn't have been suspended if she didn't have some assets of her own. Claudia Cardinale is the emotional core of the film, with this mix of false strong-mindedness and wisdom to know how to use charm as a survival instinct in a dark and savage world with no place for 'little people'. The light of hope that kills off this cynical mood is incarnated by the providential help of Harmonica and Cheyenne.",

I've seen it several times, I studied for a long time, I could give my doctoral thesis with this film, as with all the other films directed by old Sergio. The story is very simple and the only secret, the true identity of Bronson-Harmonica, is revealed, just like in other Leone's films, only at the end. Jack Elam and Woody Strode would have deserved more screen time. It could have taken, for example from Gabriele Ferzetti's time.

While intriguing I did not think it could hold up to his justly praised Once Upon A Time In America. I was wrong. It does, and in its own way is just as good, or great. Whereas America is amazingly complex, and follows the lives of several gangsters, West is sparse, amazingly straightforward, yet surreal- having been released fifteen years before America, in 1969. Instead of having affinities more in tune with Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather and Apocalypse Now it resonates with the TV series The Prisoner and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. ",
210,30 December 2007,zardoz-13,10, The Greatest Spaghetti Western of All Time!!!!!,"Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon A Time in the West,"" a.k.a. ""C'era una volta il West"" is one of the all-time greatest westerns. Indeed, hands down, it ranks as the greatest Spaghetti western. This tale about railroad expansion in the old West holds its own against the best domestic westerns of John Ford, Anthony Mann, Robert Aldritch, John Sturges, and Budd Boetticher, and Henry Hathaway. The cast is first-rate with iconic western star Henry Fonda playing against type as a cold-blooded killer and gimlet-eyed heavy Charles Bronson wearing the boots of the hero for a change. In between, Jason Robards is splendid as a bearded gunslinger named Cheyenne who has his own gang of killers and Claudia Cardinale as the up-rooted New Orleans prostitute who comes west as a mail-order mail bride for Frank Wolff, usually a villain in Italian westerns. Although it clocks in at a mammoth 165 minutes, ""C'era una volta il West"" never wastes a minute in telling its vast story, complete with flashbacks. Sergio Leone surpasses anything that he did in any of his Clint Eastwood westerns. The screenplay by Dario ""Suspira"" Argento, Bernard ""Last Tango in Paris"" Bertolucci, Sergio ""The Big Gundown"" Donati, and Sergio Leone contains several epic set-pieces that will never be equaled by anybody. Moreover, it features a sprawling plot. Ennio Morricone's orchestral score, which was finished before the first foot of film was shot, is a legendary in its own right with some unforgettable melodies. The day that Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale of ""The Professionals"") comes west from New Orleans to join Brett McBain (Frank Wolff of ""God Forgives, But I Don't"") at his house in the middle of nowhere, she arrives to find tragedy awaiting her. Brett, his two sons, and his only daughter are laid out on the very tables that Jill was to share a picnic welcoming her to their home. As it turns out, Frank (Henry Fonda of ""Fort Apache"") and his duster-clad henchmen show up ahead of Jill and massacre the McBain family. One of Frank's henchmen accidentally calls Frank by his name just as McBain's youngest son comes running out of the house. ""Now that you've called me by name,"" Frank observes and pulls out his revolver and guns down the kid! Nobody but Sergio Leone would have had the balls to pull this off with one of America's greatest heroes masquerading as the epitome of evil.",

Having just watched it again on DVD with wonderful stereo sound, I'm even more impressed by the whole awesome spectacle of the dramatic and sometimes epic flavor of the thing. Everything just seems perfect with each shot and movements of the performances. And among them is Claudia Cardinale-top billed among the cast and the only other role I'd seen her in other than the ""Pink Panther"" movies-who provides quite a luminous presence as the only truly compelling female character in the movie. She has great scenes with all three leads. And Fonda, usually an actor who plays such idealistically decent characters, is such a revelation as the take-no-prisoners-villain Frank. His showdown with Bronson is one of the most compellingly tension-filled in movie history. With Leone, nothing feels too slow. It's just right with the way things happen.

Yes, Henry Fonda tackles a role far different from his normal stuff, but in reality-it was a big step down for an actor who showed far greater acting in roles like The Wrong Man, Mister Roberts and On Golden Pond. Jason Robards, one of my personal favorites has the best role of any in the story-at least his lines are interesting. Charles Bronson stands out-mainly because he has so few lines-the less said by Mr. Bronson in a movie-the better! He does makes for a stony, stoic character he portrays. Claudia Cardinale-forget her acting-she is there for beauty in what is really a very ugly film. Some of the music score is interesting, the outdoor shots are nice, but the screen play could have used a lot more work. If you are into the ultra violent western genre-go for this and watch it.

As a person who likes the western genre and the ""Dollars Trilogy"" I really enjoyed this movie. For starters, Sergio Leone's direction is breathtaking. The shots of the western landscapes are beautiful and so are the intense facial up closes that he uses so often in his other films, particularly during the duels.

I just found it fell a little short in its casting, in its muddled middle portion, and its treatment of Claudia Cardinale's character. ",
232,18 March 2015,JamesHitchcock,8, The Handiwork of a Master,"The formula ""once upon a time"" is traditionally used to begin a fairy- tale or legend, and Sergio Leone's use of it here may be intended to claim legendary or mythical status for his epic story. (He was later to make a gangster epic entitled ""Once Upon a Time in America""). Certainly, he makes use of two familiar Western situations, so familiar that they might as well have been drawn from a fairy-tale. One involves a railroad company trying to force honest homesteaders off their land, a trope so well-known that Mel Brooks was to mock it in ""Blazing Saddles"". The other involves the mysterious lone gunman out for revenge. The film is generally classified as a ""Spaghetti Western"" because Leone was Italian, but in fact it was partly shot in Spain and partly in America. The action takes place in and around the fictitious town of Flagstone; the name was presumably inspired by Flagstaff, Arizona, and the location is doubtless supposed to be somewhere in the deserts of the American South- West.",

Most filmmakers who end up making period piece films credit Mr. Leone for their inspiration. The films he worked on were that influential. Despite him having only eight head director credits, Leone had written scripts and operated as assistant director to many other pictures. The three films that would make him a household name were A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). The last official western though Leone would end with, was this movie even though he tried getting Clint Eastwood to appear in it somewhere, one last time.

Mustering three Hollywood toughies Bronson, Fonda and Robards, the film evidently echoes the pattern of THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (1966, 8/10), although Bronson is a perfect specimen embodies both the Ugly and the Good, and for the first time Sergio deploys a woman, the Mediterranean beauty Cardinale to be a pivot among these three, contrives an interwoven plot with vengeance, duel, murder, vice as well as the righteous side of the Western ideology: masculinity, integrity, fraternity and chivalry.

""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is one of those films where I talk only about strong points because this film has no mistakes. It is beautifully made and became one of the top films in the cinema industry. Right now, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" stays on 36th place in IMDB's top 250 films and has a total point of 8.5. Just like the other films of Sergio Leone, like The Good, The Bad and The Ugly or Once Upon a Time in America; ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is also a masterpiece. This is one of the films where you can easily guess the director if you have seen his previous films. He uses all his known techniques to their limits. I have mentioned those techniques of Sergio Leone while writing about his other films but it is no harm to mention them also here. He uses extreme close up shots to express the feelings of the characters whenever it is possible. All of those scenes are silent and much more expressive. He never fails to use beautiful soundtracks in those scenes. In Sergio Leone's films soundtracks are as important as any other component, therefore his collaboration with the composer Ennio Morricone was very important. Before, they have collaborated in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly as well, and if you have seen that film, you will understand the importance of his soundtracks.",

The story is excellent, and Leone's direction is never at fault.  While Morricone is not known for this score, it is quite good and fitting as always.

I guess it is cool that Henry Fonda is an evil piece of work, but other than that this movie really has nothing going for it, except Claudia Cardinale and her legendary beauty. The pacing was way too slow, the scenes were unnecessarily long and dragged often, and the acting left much to be desired.

It is slow paced, but this is due to an amazing score by life time collaborator and friend Ennio Morricone. Claudia Cardinale steals the show, and gives the performance of a lifetime. In fact the shot after Claudia Cardinal comes in the train station, was made after the music was made, and when the camera pans up, the music accompanies it in perfect harmony (this was duly noted by Brian De Palma, who could not figure out that the shot was made after the music was made, until Leone told him). Best performance of Charles Bronson, and the casting of Henry Fonda as the bad guy is simply genius, and arguably also his best performance ever. It describes the industrial revolution, symbolized by the train, the train tracks, and the train station. And lest we forget, Jason Robards' best performance ever, as Cheyenne.

258,18 June 2008,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,10, One of the greatest western ever!,"The so-called spaghetti Western achieved its apotheosis in Sergio Leone's magnificently mythic (and utterly outlandish) Once upon a Time in the West. After a series of international hits starring Clint Eastwood (from A Fistful of Dollars to The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly), Leone outdid himself with this spectacular, larger-than-life, horse-operatic epic about how the West was won. (And make no mistake: this is the wide, wide West, folks--so the widescreen/letter boxed version is strongly recommended.) The unholy trinity of Italian cinema--Leone, Bernardo Bertolucci, and Dario Argento--concocted the story about a woman (Claudia Cardinale) hanging onto her land in hopes that the transcontinental railroad would reach her before a steely-eyed, black-hearted killer (Fonda) does. (The film's advertising slogan was: ""There were three men in her life. One to take her ... one to love her ... and one to kill her."") Meanwhile, Leone shoots his stars' faces as if they were expansive Western landscapes, and their towering bodies as if they were looming rock formations in John Ford's Monument Valley",
259,3 June 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,9, Perhaps Leone's best.,"'Once Upon A Time In The West (1968)' is an epic not of scale but of scope, more concerned with unspoken emotion than complex plotting. Of course, the thing is still grand in almost every sense of the word. I mean, just look at it. It's gorgeous. Leone proves, once and for all, that he's the master of composition, making each and every frame as beautiful as possible. The screen constantly seems full, be it with a sweeping vista or a single pair of eyes, and that makes for an incredibly engaging experience. It isn't busy - in fact, it makes a point of taking its time - but it's always saying something. The entire affair feels soaked in emotion, an intangible romanticism that almost provokes a strange kind of nostalgic melancholy. It's an odd effect but it's undeniable; there's nothing quite like it. Instead of focusing on macho stand-offs or, even, western archetypes, it focuses on the dynamics between its core cast of somewhat atypical characters. They aren't outwardly complex but they are inwardly rich, brimming with desires and feelings their harsh environment doesn't quite allow them to express. They're all portrayed impeccably, too. This is the kind of acting that doesn't get the recognition it deserves, the kind that can break your heart without so much as a whisper. It's all in the eyes, be they bright blue or boldly brown, and it feels strangely real. Make no mistake, the film is stylish. Its final dual may just be my favourite in film history, with its perfect editing and bullet-across-time conclusion. Then, there's the music. Morricone's score may just be the best he has ever produced. Each distinct character theme is almost as effective as the last, contrasting and complementing in the most satisfying of ways. It's simply sublime. The same can be said of the entire affair, really. It's arguably Leone's best effort, easily rising towards the top of its genre, and it's undeniably affecting, to boot. It keeps getting more and more impressive, its filmmaking often making you smile simply because it's so good. It's also really entertaining. There's no doubt that the experience is one worth having all over again. 9/10.",

Still, I was able to find enough to admire here. Sergio Leone is a director who, if nothing else, knows damn well how to stage a scene. The first hour is basically a combination of extended introductions to our main characters, but each one is incredibly tense and memorable. We meet the mysterious Harmonica (Charles Bronson) gunning down those who were out to kill him, the villainous Frank (Henry Fonda) as he shoots a child, the mischievous Cheyenne (Jason Robards) as he escapes custody and the beautiful Jill (Claudia Cardinale) as she arrives off her train.",

A young woman arrives by train in a small town in the interior of the American West and when she arrives at the farm where she will live with her new husband and children, they find them dead at close range, victims of greedy men who seek to take possession of the land that will be worth a fortune with the passage of the new train line through the property. Alone, she gains sympathy from the main suspect who offers to find the real responsible for the murders, and also from a lone gunman looking for revenge. The script is exquisite, with precise dialogues. The characters are goods built and interpreted by the beasts of the time, Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson and Claudia Cardinale, but the one who stole my attention was the actor Jason Robards who lives the Cheyenne, a crude and very honorable man. It is a western with long plans and with its own time, which despite causing strangeness for the duration, are necessary for the narrative of the story. A photograph highlighted by the framings, wide, beautiful, unusual and, add to that an unforgettable soundtrack, composed by Ennio Morricone, and you have a masterpiece. Pleasing to the eye!",

I'd have to say that this was much better than the typical Italian western, which is 2 hours of people staring at each other and odd sounding gunshots. The cinematography was beautiful, as were the sets and costumes. The acting was pretty good, especially Fonda and Robards. What is missing was either a screenplay that filled 2 1/2 hours of screen time or an editor to cut out about 45 minutes of superfluous material.

Sergio Leone uses sound(and sometimes the lack of it), music(by Ennio Morricone), atmosphere and some of the best acting talents of the time to create a masterpiece of a western that grabs you before the beginning credits finish to pretty-much the end with only small lapses in the middle. It's neat to watch each of the unique characters go thru their paces as they wind thru the story coming to each of their conclusions. Charles Bronson is great as ""Harmonica"", the man who plays before he speaks. He has a story to tell that comes out in the last 15 minutes of the movie in the way of a flashback. Most of Sergio Leone's characters don't speak a lot except for Jason Robards' character who is the most un-Sergio-leone-like but his character even works for the most part. Fonda plays a ruthless killer who's looking to gain the property of the widow played by Claudia Cardinale and along the way gains respect for Harmonica despite their extreme differences. Cardinale is unpredictable as the widow who's just trying to do what's right for herself and holds her own very well. This epic western could only have been better if it never ended. A sequel would have been great just to see how the remaining characters carry on and to see how the new town of ""Sweetwater"" exists with Cardinale at the helm. Bravo Mr. Leone!! This is the kind of western that I can handle. Deep on character and story with just enough bravado to not lose it's western-branding.",

This film is a breviary on the art of editing both on the creation of shots of the same scene that play on the depth of field, the very close-ups, the overall shots and as such the final duel between Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda is sublime with in addition the music of Ennio Morricone which is consubstantial with the staging of the film and the artistic form, especially for this final duel.",

Unfortunately, words like slow, painstaking, and violent term the film just as accurately. I'm not one to shy away from a film simply because it's long. If done correctly, plot can be woven along quite nicely through a long film. (One of my favorite films is From Here to Eternity, which tells a story through a long film quite well.) This film however, felt more of a poorly done documentary than a film at all. (It should be noted that I am a documentary fan, emphasis on poorly done.) The audience has traveled 2 hours into the film full of excess violence and bloodshed before we get any details on the plot. With what is well done in the film, like the lighting, the long shots, the editing, and sound effects, there is so much more that detracts from it. The acting was only sub-par, saved only by a strong screen presence from the veteran Henry Fonda, albeit, in a shift in the roles I'm used to seeing him in. Packed with more violence than a Tarantino flick, the needless bloodshed especially against a little boy 20 mins. in was off- putting to say the least. Maybe it wasn't my type of film, and maybe I'm not well-versed enough in westerns to appreciate this film, but Once Upon a Time in the West is not a story I will be revisiting.",

I was impressed by Charles Bronson's performance, I used to see him in movies like Death Wish but this role was probably the best his performance, now I realized what a charismatic actor he is. I liked his character very much. Every time when you hear him playing that creepy melody with his harmonica, you know that it's a bad news for someone. I also was impressed by Claudia Cardinale's acting, at first I thought that she get that role only for good-looking but later turn out that she's a good actress too, it's funny, that I newer heard of her before, I should check out her other movies. Jason Robards glinted in some scenes too, especially in first dialog between his character and Claudia Cardinale's character.

Probably had to be that way to do it right as American directors want only action and more fake and unrealistic and historically incorrect action, not human reality or sensitivity......

277,22 December 2003,sapblatt,9," Well-made, classic Western epic from Sergio Leone",Sergio Leone's epic 1968 (1969 USA release) western masterpiece `Once Upon A Time in the West' is a visually and emotionally stunning film from start to finish. The location shots filmed in Utah and Arizona are wide and bright to the eye. Leone and his cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli have complete grasp on what they are seeing and how they want it to appear on the big screen. ,
278,26 January 2004,LBytes,10, A modern work of art,"After many years, I recently saw this movie again on the fantastic DVD they've released. There are very few westerns, maybe very few movies of any kind that can match the artistry of this picture. From the opening sequence to the climactic ending it has a gliding, almost still-life pace that might throw a contemporary viewer off. In stark contrast to the action-junkie flicks so common today, the contemplative approach to the sweeping vistas and powerful but short-lived violence elevates this ultimate spaghetti western to an opera. As they say in one of the commentaries, the actors sing with their eyes.",
279,14 August 2021,x_manicure_x,8, The end of the Old West,"Hands down Leone's most mature western, even if a little low-key when compared to the Dollars Trilogy. His style is recognizable but strangely sober here, with the calm before the storm eating up most of the time. Action, music, and humor, which were the main three elements of Leone's past works, are this time kept to the minimum necessary to emphasize the slow-burning wait for the gun to fire, for the hero to finally appear. While ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" was held back by its episodic nature, this time we have a coherent complex plot that connects all characters and slowly reveals their nature, at a time where the Old West was about to be wiped out by the birth of a new nation. The film has a melancholic mood and is packed with overt references to western classics taken out of context, as if Leone's aim was to bid farewell to the genre that had made him a household name. Sometimes it drags on a little too much, but the payoff is guaranteed.",

I don't need to look at a tumbleweed for 2 minutes or a ""bad guy's"" face for that long either without dialog to add anything. I felt like yelling at the TV something like ""GET ON WITH IT""! I find that a good rule of thumb for movie watching is the ""20 minute Rule"". If after 20 minutes the movie doesn't do anything for you there's a very good chance it won't after 2 hours. Sort of like going on a blind date, you sorta know after the first 5 minutes if it's a bust or not, then the best thing to do is to be polite until you can gracefully exit. Good luck to anyone else watching it, maybe it gets better after the first hour but I didn't want to risk wasting any more of my life watching paint dry.",

There's nothing hurrying them, as every day is the same as the other, and what cannot be done today, can be done tomorrow. So nothing presses you to answer quickly, or even talk. You can think a lot before speaking, and the other will wait for you. There are two things that do pass quickly: bullets and trains. The first one was the symbol of power (the power of disrupting the monotonous life of the West), until the latter came. As it's beautifully said by Frank: sitting behind Morton's desk feels almost like holding a gun, but more powerful. Morton's Locomotive brought, above all, History and Progress to the West. Time started to run, and bullets cannot stop time.",
282,13 July 2010,jboothmillard,7, One upon a Time in the West,"I will admit I didn't really get the sense that there was a plot in this western at all, but it didn't spoil anything, I was going to watch it regardless, from director Sergio Leone (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly). Basically the railways are being placed all over America, even the far west, in particular a small border town full of guns and crime. It opens with an inspired sequence seeing men sitting around doing not much, one guy traps a fly in his gun barrel, they are waiting for the train to arrive. Anyway, Arriving into this town is Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale), who is shocked to find her new husband Brett (Frank Wolff) and family slaughtered, and the prime suspect is coffee loving Cheyenne (Jason Robards). The real killer however is gang leader Frank (Henry Fonda) who is trying to get his own way with the ownership of the railroad, along with the mysterious man known only for playing his Harmonica (Charles Bronson). Also staring Gabriele Ferzetti as Morton, Keenan Wynn as Sheriff, Paolo Stoppa as Sam and Marco Zuanelli as Wobbles. As I said, I didn't really get the plot, I just enjoyed the actors being cool and quite often quiet to effect, the violence and gun play, and some good music by Ennio Morricone. The critics describe it as some kind of operatic thing with the little dialogue, I suppose I'd agree with that, it is about fifteen minutes short of three hours, but it is certainly a different kind of western to see. Very good!",
283,13 February 2009,ackstasis,9," ""When you hear a strange sound, drop to the ground""","Sergio Leone may not have chosen the high-brow subject subject matter of his 1960s European contemporaries, but, boy, his films are pure cinema. Leone may have progressed beyond the charming but erratic editing style of his earliest Westerns  'A Fistful of Dollars (1964)' and 'For a Few Dollars More (1965)'  but his use of the camera is unlike any other filmmaker I've ever seen. The director's wide frame, captured in Techniscope, is like a freshly-painted canvas, its watercolours glistening under the intense Western sun, and style dripping from every shot. Mostly gone is the slightest hint of parody that I observed in his earlier films; Ennio Morricone's score, rather than being joyously overwhelming as in 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly (1966),' instead meditates gracefully on the passions and losses of its major characters. This added grace recognisable throughout the film emerges no doubt from a far greater budget, the film bankrolled by Paramount Pictures and shot largely in the United States {with Leone paying tribute to John Ford through the use of his favoured Monument Valley}.",

294,23 September 2021,sjanders-86430,10, Sergio Leone is my all time favorite director,"Sergio Leone was always wanting to do a film about America and about the West. This film is about the railroad coming and transforming the West. The four main characters are Jason Robards, Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, and Claudia Cardinale. Leone had to have Fonda or he wouldn't do it. Fonda was about 63. He had to be older than Bronson to fit the plot. Morricone composed a musical theme for the three men main characters. When you hear a certain musical piece, you know that character will appear. Fonda makes love to Cardinale in a close up of his old face, and the scene doesn't work. Other close ups are genius like those of Charles Bronson; he never looked as good. The film opening is famous for no music; just the fly buzzing and the squeaking windmill and the water dripping on one man's head. The train shot is from under the train. The train pulls out. Bronson stands alone. ""We only have two horses."" ""That's two too many."" responds Bronson who then shoots the three men dead. This beginning with the fly on the closup of the man's mouth, the drip on the bald head, the duster coats, the rough hewn platform, and the old man are all striking elements that continue throughout the film. Cardinale's arrvival to the shocking family deaths is unforgettable. The crippled railroad man with the Pacific Ocean painting on the wall of his office railroad car are other unique elements. Jason Robards wants coffee from Cardinale. Fonda wants sex. Bronson wants nothing, and she likes him the best. Her dead husband bought the lumber for the train station. The water is there, and so the end shot shows the train has arrived.",

Combining pieces from all of the great westerns that preceded it, he made a one of a kind film.  Showing the natural progression from his first three westerns to here, he more or less takes a lot of the same themes and ideas from those and pulled them together.  More epic and operatic than `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,' and without the lightheartedness that gave that film it's undeniable uniqueness.  Instead, Leone focuses more on the dark side of the west, and the dark side of human nature as well.  The four main players, Charles Bronson, Henry Fonda, Jason Robards, and Claudia Cardinale, all give the performances of the lifetime.  From a filmmaking standpoint, few movies have ever been so perfect  the combination of gorgeous cinematography, incredible music, and the sheer style are second to none.  A true masterpiece.",

At the time, I could have described it as some of the coolest movie gunfight scenes separated by long stretches of ... nothing! I recently had the chance to see director's cut of Once upon a time in the West, and how different it seemed through the eyes of an adult. I was struck by how this was truly a movie about the most powerful and primal emotions: hate, lust, greed and revenge - mostly revenge. It' s the more like a Greek tragedy. Watching the movie, I felt that whatever the reasons why Leone had chosen a western genre (aesthetic, practical who knows?), the story was so universal it could have taken place anytime or anywhere. We feel we are in a universe much closer to Kurosawa's than John Wayne's. The violence in Once upon a time caused a sensation when the movie was first released. At the time, it was denounced as gratuitous, yet on viewing, one becomes aware of how fundamental it is to the movie. Sergio Leone displayed the themes with a brutality and raw energy which was only emerging in the movie mainstream (think Easy Rider, etc). This is definitely not your run of the mill western.",

Claudia Cardinale is just gorgeous, her role is very important in order for the rest of the plot to keep up in the film. I guess I shouldn't be surprised by the genius of director Sergio Leone, that guy was amazing. I believe this western should be right up there with The Good The Bad and The Ugly, to tell you the truth, this film kept my attention althroughout its two hour and forty five minute mayhem. Charles Bronson (with no mustache!) as Harmonica was brilliant, every time you heard a Harmonica, there he was..... Jason Robards dialogue was great, he added a nice little flair of comic relief to the script. Henry Fondas character was very believable and not too nice I might add.

The result is the magnum opus of Leone's career (though many others may debate if that title should go to Once Upon a Time in America, or TGTBATU), and it is not to be missed for any reason. The movie is worth seeing alone for the performance of Henry Fonda as the merciless villain Frank.

309,17 March 2011,hanvl,10, Beautiful score and great film,"Perhaps the most famous of Leone's western with unforgettable music score. The story of lone hit-man Harmonica (Charles Bronson) going for his revenge is a classic. Leone in this move hired Bronson for his hero with no name instead of his usual Eastwood. Instead of Eastwood here are another actor heavyweights as Fonda, Cardinalle and Robarts. This story is very good; it follows more plot line for them to cross at the end. Also until the final shootout it is not clear why does Harmonica seeks revenge. Acting is overall very good, weakest links is Bronson who was the worst of main actors, but as he is not required to act much he is good. Fonda is great as villain and is clearly enjoying playing main antagonist. Robarts is very convincing as good natured bandit. Cardinale is very beautiful and also very good as prostitute trying to get a new life. Score is amazing as in all three preceding Leones westerns.",

The character of the quiet mysterious stranger looking for revenge comes by a lot, but never like Bronson could do it. Sergio Leone had to make another western because the studio forced him to, and figured he might as well do the best one ever made. The camera work in this movie is amazing. The actors look like gods on their silver screen, towering over the world, delivering classic lines like it's a contest or something. This movie uses every western cliché in the book and makes something beautiful one of them. The highlights can hardly be counted, but to me the inevitable duel scene takes the cake.

Before sudden, ear-shattering gunshots ring out, Leone orchestrates masterful moments of long and intense waiting. In the famous 10-minute opening credit sequence, we're left for a long, long time just listening to drips from a leak, a squeaky windmill, a door slamming open and shut, and a fly buzzing. We listen and keep listening, anticipating; anticipating violence or silence or both. And Charles Bronson appear!!!! I loved the end too, with Jason Robards on his horse (i don't spoiled, i can't tell more). And Henry Fonda make the bad guy, a very good idea (in this time Henry Fonda only play the good guy).

Ennios music adds the quintessential spice to the movie with anybody watching the movie wanting to go back to listen to the theme again.

Basically, two less-than-scrupulous lone-guns in the west help to protect a widow and her land from an evil outlaw and his gang. The movie is made up of tons of long, slow shots with lots of intricate audio and scenery, and very little dialogue. These are broken up every so often by short, sharp bursts of intense violence. The overall effect is that the movie does feel like it drags on - I get what Leone was trying to do; I just don't like it. The acting was good, the characters less so. To me, they didn't have much personality at all, but at least they were more likable than 'In America's characters. The main villain, Frank, played by Henry Fonda was an exception in that he was an awesome character, and one of the best western villains I've seen. The cinematography was great.

345,26 January 2023,fredrikgunerius,9, Every image feels momentous,"The most elaborate of Leone's so-called spaghetti westerns, in many ways an exorbitant culmination of everything he had perfected over the course of the Dollars Trilogy. From the lingering, atmospheric intro to the profound, cathartic ending, Leone dazzles with his compositions and pacing - his camera constantly examining the larger-than-life emotions on his characters' furrowed faces. When the calmly observant Harmonica (Charles Bronson) wields his instrument and eventually lock eyes with the arrogant but wary villain Frank (Henry Fonda), it encapsulates just about everything the Western genre has always been about, and in an elegantly understated manner. Once Upon a Time in the West is more narratively ambitious than the Dollars Trilogy, it has more layers and more complex characters. What the films still have in common, apart from the theme and setting, is an aesthetic cleanliness. In Once Upon a Time, every image feels momentous, almost to the point of hyperbole. And still you feel the characters' plight and the weight of the land. A wonderful movie with delightful performances from its four principal stars and a fine score from Ennio Morricone, although admittedly not one of his best.",

Maybe I was too young or maybe I was just not interested because my attention span was limited who knows but a lot of years later I probably grew up a little and the time I sat down and properly watched this film I came to appreciate it for what it is. It is a masterpiece and in order for anybody to fully understand why, I think the watcher needs to pay attention because the subtleties and the detail are not always obvious and there are very small body movements and shifts of position which if missed can render the scene you are watching confusing. Naturally if you start being confused you can tend to lose interest and I think thats where I made my mistakes. Please if you haven't watched it rent, buy or borrow this film and at least judge for yourself. Looking at the top 20 films in the IMDb top 250 list this film has the lowest votes and there could be all sorts of reasons why but to simply watch it is the starting point.

This is the first Sergei Leone film I have ever seen (unless you count catching part of his 1984 gangster flick on TV one time). The film takes its time getting to know the people, and it takes just about that long to figure out just what is going on. But once everything is said and done, this is one heck of an epic western. Henry Fonda stars in a rare turn as Frank, a villain so charming one could almost forget he's a cold-hearted killer. He works for a railroad baron doing his dirty work, but he's starting to move up in the world, much to the chagrin of his employer, Mr. Morton. Frank is responsible for the massacre of an Irish landholder and his family, shortly before the man's new wife, Claudia Cardinale, arrives from New Orleans. The murder was set up to look like Cheyenne, (a wise-cracking Jason Robards) a notorious outlaw, is responsible. In another story thread, a mysterious stranger who plays a harmonica (Charles Bronson) is after Frank in a revenge plot that is not revealed until the end.

378,2 May 2002,gkbazalo,10, Music and symbolism,"What's left to say about this incredible western?  As usual, each character have his or her own musical theme, but--not as usual-- the themes combine in ways that indicate the interactions and symbolism of each character. Harmonica and Frank are emotionally and thematically joined at the hip. Their themes intertwine just as their life lines do.  Cheyenne's theme, which can be, at different times, either comical or threatening, reflects his outmoded lifestyle, which we see being replaced by the lifestyle of the town folk.  Jill is the whore who becomes the mother (or midwife) of the emerging civilization being born in the desert with the coming of the railroad.  Her theme is also the theme of that civilization.  Watch the scene where she leaves the railroad station, hires a driver and rides through the railroad town.  This is not the archetypal western town of Hollywood with a saloon and a few horses tied up at the hitching post.  It is a bustling, living entity, with shops, public transportation, respectable women and men going about their business.  And Jill, although  she comes from the ""big city""--New Orleans--, is quite pleased by it all.  By the end of the film, she will be the founder of the next town on the railroad's path.   Relax, get to know each of the four major characters, listen to the music, and don't rush through it. This is an epic!",

Many years later I happened to see the film, recognized the music, and loved it at first sight!

Do the two men protect the newly widowed Mrs. McBain from the ruthless killer Frank? Or do they just use her and the prospect of her money to get to where they want to be? Just because someone risks his life for another doesn't mean it is a selfless act. Quite the contrary, it usually means they have a lot more invested in the situation than one might think.

Leone revolutionized the genre with his raw, brutal, and visceral films that matured and revitalized the spaghetti western and made it into something so much more grand. Once Upon a Time in the West is arguably his most ambitious film, and the biggest production he has ever tackled. It's almost three hours long and boasts an all star cast and very impressive sets. The film is about an assassin working for a massive railroad conglomerate who is out to get a beautiful widow. A mysterious harmonica playing stranger joins forces with a notorious bandit in order to protect this widow and stop this madman. The story is one of epic proportions that spans many large set pieces and an all around epic scale production.

388,5 July 2018,mibyph,9, Visual Poetry,"There is so much to like here. I must admit there are also flaws. The spare dialogue is sometimes apt but also on occasion obvious or crude. Because there is so little, with ambient noise and music soundtrack so beautiful that the contrast is jarring.
Several of the character actors, besides those in the opening sequence, are so little used that many of their scenes must have bee cut due to the length of the film. 
The sound was all recorded independently of the filming, standard procedure in many Italian films. Claudia Cardinale's voice was dubbed which is such a shame since for an actor, their voice is an important part of their craft. View ""The Professionals"" from about the same period to hear her real voice. 
Henry Fonda is indeed a real villain here but was nearly as bad in ""Firecreek"" made around the same time. The opening sequence was either inspired by or inspired that of ""The Train Robbers"".
My main enjoyment of this film is purely visual. Near the end there is a telephoto shot of the train arriving at Sweetwater with all the railroad workers gathering, to the music of Morricone. This is truly an emotional moment as are many others.

Instead of just making a fourth ""Dollars"" film or turning it into a mere spaghetti oater, Leone created a very long but fitting elegy to the taming of the West. Released just shortly before Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, like the Peckinpah film, was unfortunately chopped by its distributor to allow for more showings in theaters, making it a critical and box office bomb.

It's a powerful piece about individuals trying to find a meaning for their lives. It's about people with enough guts to start over again or fade out with breathtaking dignity. Leone and Morricone, Bertolucci and Argento. It's not a dream team with nothing to deliver. This film is what you would expect from such big names undertaking a massive and epic masterpiece. This thing will pierce your heart and your senses. It's cinematography is intoxicating, and the soundtrack delivers a full punch of emotions to your stomach. For me sometimes it's really hard to take without feeling a teardrop trying to escape my eye. It's sad when film viewers fail to feel the brutal embrace of one of these classic films. Few directors from this age can take such an endeavor and turn it into something this fantastic (Paul Thomas Anderson is one of them).",

In between, we have a complex, psychological drama encompassing a corrupt railroad tycoon, Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti); a delicious, reformed gold-digger, Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) recently married to Brett McBain (Frank Wolff); a sociopath, Frank (Henry Fonda) who simply delights in killing; and a bank robber/killer, Cheyenne (Jason Robards) who is wrongly accused of mass murder and thus determined to set the record straight.",

It begins with the train depot scene from ""High Noon"" (1952), with repetitions and exaggerations which lend themselves to the comic and much of it was shot in John Ford's Monument Valley. Ennio Morricone's grandiloquent score provides needed cover for the marvelously pompous, innovative and arresting visual style.

407,7 February 2004,ChoiceCuts,10, A cinematic masterpiece.,"This is definitively the best western I've ever seen. It might even be the best film I've ever seen. The reasons why I think so are many. Firstly the casting is great. Claudia Cardinale is perfect as Jill and Henry Fonda is one of the best bad guys I've ever witnessed. The wide camera shots are just amazing, it's like you can see the entire wild west when you look at the horizon, wich is a bit ironic since most of the film was shot in Spain. The closeups at the eyes, Leone's trademark, are also to be found here, better and closer than ever. Ennio Morricone has also contributed to the experience by making what I think is the greatest score ever. Every character has it's own song. Some are beautiful (Jill's song) others are truly chilling (like Frank's song), every song is terrific though.",

The film is very long, but you won't even notice. There is not one boring/mediocre shot in this movie! Leone is at the top of his craft, and everything is a visual feast. The characters are deep an unpredictable (the plot will keep you guessing). Bronson, Fonda, and Robards put on a clinic for the rest of the acting world. The film is about the railroads, and the towns and people that lived in their development. It is also about vendetta's long past. Once Upon In the Time is nothing new, as far as westerns go. It's a typical genre stuff. Vengeance, railroads and big business vs. the little guy. Yet this film is more entertaining and well made than 99% of westerns. Bronson is the mysterious stranger, Fonda is one despicable villain, and Robards is HILARIOUS. This is arguably Leone's best film (even though it is Eastwoodless) and i can't recommend it enough.",

There are less movies I saw that often then ""in the West"". Every time it's a party for the eyes and the soul, even when it's in TV not as good than on cinema. As many people told before, Ennio Morricone made one of the best score ever. It's funny, that he wrote the score before Leone made the first picture of the movie.

419,29 November 2019,peeedeee-94281,6, A Reasonably Good Western For Non-Fans of Westerns,"I will admit I don't watch too many westerns, at least not the old ones. I've seen many of the later ones, The Unforgiven, Quick & The Dead, Quigley Down Under (although set in Australia), etc...
I thought this was a reasonably good movie, albeit a bit long in places. Like the wait at the train station. I get it, it's the title sequence. But it felt like it dragged a bit too long.
McBain's wife and her motivations were confusing. So we learn of her history, where she came from. She's a city girl who comes to the area, but why does she insist on staying. It doesn't sound like she even had any idea how to live out in the middle of the desert, but she chooses to stay. The only reason she appears to want to leave later in the movie was due to pressure from her husband's killer. I couldn't figure out why she was necessary to be in the film other than to be some eye candy to tantalize all the men, including her husband's character Frank. There is even a confusing 'love' scene between her and Henry Fonda (Frank). I guess it was to stay alive, but it seemed way too romantic to look like she was going through the motions to save her life. I expected her to be a tough woman, shooting at bandits and such, but she was just another maiden in distress.
Charles Bronson's character was alright. His character seemed underdeveloped. The harmonica motif got tiresome after a while, even when you learned about why he had it, later in the movie. He just seemed to be there to show off his weathered face and squinty stare, little emotional range. Even at the end, when he got his satisfaction, there was little reaction from him. Jason Robard's and Henry Fonda's characters seemed more developed, much more interesting.
The story itself felt cliched and generic. I don't know if this was typical of most western movies. I remember watching Shane a week or so earlier, and it had a similar plot: Wealthy land owner wants to buy someone's property, but they refuse to budge. So people die, and it's up to the stranger in town to save the day. In this case, there was more than one 'stranger' to help out.
The musical cues were nice, but as pointed out, the harmonica to announce Bronson's entrance, and other repeated musical cues were a bit much by the third time they were used. Usually there's more variation in musical scores, I guess Leone and Morricone wanted the exact same sound for each character.
Overall, a reasonably good movie for anyone who isn't necessarily a fan of the Western genre. With some judicious editing, it could be a much more interesting film. I found myself watching it in pieces over 3 or 4 days. I couldn't imagine trying to sit through the whole thing in one sitting.",
420,31 May 2001,BigMan-12,5, Grossly Overrated Movie,"Leone is usually stellar, but this movie is a misfire.  Perhaps its slow pace played better 30 years ago, but several moments in this movie are soooo sloooow that I couldn't stand it.  Every scene, every close-up is an opportunity for the actors to ham it up and further slow down the film. Unlike most who view this film, I found the acting to be rather ordinary for the most part.  Bronson was nothing special here; I can only surmise that people's preconceptions of Fonda led them to believe that he did a great acting job here. (Just because he was the heavy.)  Most of the characters did not appear to be more than standard cut-outs, or an opportunity for big-name stars to wear Western duds.",
421,11 December 2002,princy,3, Spaghetti Trash!,"I can't believe that this movie has received so many great reviews.  One of the five greatest westerns ever made said one article.  Clearly there is something to these Italian made spaghetti westerns that I am not getting.  I still am undecided as to whether or not this is supposed to have been a send-up of western movies, and if so then maybe I can understand the atrocious acting. All in all, Italians make the worst westerns and horror movies (I should have known better when I saw Dario Argento's name in the credits)",
422,22 April 2021,NpMoviez,10, Yet another masterpiece by Sergio Leone.,"If I am to speak about the goods in this movie, I can easily end it by saying ""the entire film"". The character introductions in this film are some of the best character introductions of all times. Especially those of ""Harmonica"" and Frank. The intros don't have a dialogue or an exposition to introduce them. All the movie does is that they show you some characters, clearly indicating that they're up to something. Even what they do is quite interesting. Had they been the main characters of this film - that would've never been a problem. Then they introduce one of the characters. A brief set of dialogues between them, and that's all. We get the characterization of one of them, in a brief time. The script might probably indicate some filler characters doing some random stuff, and the character gets introduced with some dialogues. What makes it so interesting? Leone uses the ridiculously great score by Morricone and silences (by which I don't mean completely void of sound) throughout the sequence. But within that silence, there's a feeling of something about to explode. That particular thing is one of Leone's greatest tropes when it comes to his Spaghetti Westerns. And, everything that was supposed to explode, explodes with the loudest of sounds. Even the character that got introduced in the scene has a particular tune associated with him, which gives a perception of there's something that's about that character, we still don't know about. In short, Leone says indirectly that ""You don't know all about him. Wait. I will tell you. You're gonna be satisfied."" and he keeps up with his promise and in the final act, we get the answer to that. Leone builds up the suspense without a single confusing word that needs our thought, and that has worked almost everytime. With all the silences indicating the upcoming explosion, he introduces the other character - in a same and quite a bit different way. One of those characters was played by Charles Bronson and the other by the great Henry Fonda. I was convinced that even if I am watching a Spaghetti Western where the protagonist can be someone like The Man with no Name, who is characterized as someone slightly better than the villains, a character like the one portrayed by Fonda can never be a protagonist.",

I concur with: ""Simply put, this movie is the most visually stimulating and engrossing movie I have ever watched."" I #1 found it to convey graphic reality in a way I have never experienced in any other film - and that came across on a crummy black and white TV that I first viewed it on when stumbling upon a late night showing in 1973. The next day in high school, I was reeling from what I had experienced - it cast a difference on plain 'ole mundane life - it is definitely an ART Flick - not mere entertainment. There are some elements that make it even more intensely valuable to us here still in 2012. It is somewhat of an overlooked legacy. The actors are nearly all dead. They truly lived and died and now very few of the current ""Sweetwater"" community knows of them what went on before we took over... The soundtrack is real- the sounds throughout the movie and the musical score is real - not sampler generated - the horns are horns, the chorus is people, the windmill is a windmill, the gunfire is amplified guns, Leone used a technique of amplifying real sound- bigger than life - for effect- works wonderfully- even the plate re-verb used on the guitar tracks is plate, a large cumbersome device, but not digital emulation...",

Now this film is a real creepy at most of the places but, this could not overweight the grace of this type of film making. Its just amazing that a man could think of and actually work on making such a film. This film is a Spaghetti Western film which has nothing special in its story actually but, but, but, it is an epic of melodrama in its different sense. To me the film was cosy, enchanting and swaying. The people and there lives, their desires and needs, work done to fulfill them and then their consequences all things grafted so differently but cohesively that one cant remain feeling dissatisfied after watching it. There were few dialogues that can make us satisfied...call out the smiling sound of ""whooooh yup"". Now all the credits goes to the director that he worked on making such a genre and made his artists work for perfection , all in a different sense.

This may be an example of a new film theory:  The Composer as Auteur.  Morricone's work here was deserving of an Oscar, and the fact that it wasn't even nominated in a year in which Burt Bacharach's atrocious score for the mediocre ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" was honored, speaks volumes about the Academy's ignorance and lack of taste.

Those that have huge budgets, big names, release dates that are planned to exploit box office, awards and expected weekend earnings. Then there are those that are made for a ""certain audience"". These films wear their pretensions on there sleeves and in doing so attempt to be branded as something ""daring"" or ""special"" simply because they don't have ""studio"" support. I don't mean to imply that some of these films (large or small budgets) don't have merit and are not good or even great films, as there are many that most certainly are. 30 years ago, Paramount wanted to capitalize on the ""Dollars"" being generated by the Leone/Eastwood/Morricone trilogy. With a blank check and Henry Fonda, Sergio Leone succeeded in making a western that would fail to ignite at America's box office, garner mostly negative reviews and end up being hacked up by its parent, Paramount. What Leone and Parmount could not have known at the time was that Leone's 3 hour homage to cinema would take its place in the company of films like Welles's ""Touch of Evil"", Laughton's ""Night of the Hunter"", Capra's ""It's a wonderful Life"" and Scott's ""BladeRunner"", etc. These films and others were rejected, disowned, chopped and forgotten.

Cross him off the list. Its all just cash-in time, now."" And for almost 40 years, I never saw Once Upon A Time In The West. Oh sure, there were those late night TV airings where I saw the first excruciatingly exquisite scene and dug the music and the mood and then fell asleep. But, a couple of Ennio Morricone CDs always kept the theme music to Once Upon A Time in my immediate memory. I vowed to sit through the whole thing the next time it came on late night TV. Last night was the night I came to realize what a fool I'd been all those years. Wow, what a film. Every scene is a delight to behold, especially now that I have a 46"" LCD to enjoy it all the more. The shots of Monument Valley (reminiscent of How The West Was Won-another personal fave) are incredible as are all the trademark Leone close-ups. Everything in the movie is just perfect. Fonda is the ultimate villain (WHO KNEW!), Robards is excellent, as usual, even Claudia Cardinale provides more than the de rigeur eye candy.

445,2 March 2021,judemcrobbie,8," Not quite the Good, the Bad and the Ugly","It's almost a psychological thriller as opposed to the gunslinging cowboy stereotypes. There are very little set pieces compared to usual, more opting to develop character and let the plot unfold from there. What makes it a psychological thriller compared to a generic western is how every one is play 4-D chess with one another. This both helps and hinders the movie as sometimes it is so well conveyed and sometimes not so much. It does have all the generic western traits, quick draws, saloons etc but it also has a sort of godfather feel as there is one person really pulling all the strings.
The movie does kind of suffer from tonal ambiguity and inconsistencies as the editing skips from a hard hitting scene to a comedy scene with no in between.
Sergio Leone has a monopoly on western movies and awesome endings as he culminates all the plot points together in a big finale where 9 times out of 10 it will put a moment of realisation in your mind.
Jill McBain has an arc of nothing really. She doesn't grow or develop in anyway. This really interests me as her arc does not involve her at all, choosing to find out things about her that she may not want people to know.
The suspense in this movie is mortifying as it uses the silence so well. Three men standing across in long trench coats as one man appears from behind the train shouldn't make you squirm but it does, and then top it off with one of the best one liners.

It is so great to sit down with a movie that you know nothing about and have it turn into a real gem. This movie was beautifully filmed. A real master at work. The story starts with a brutal attack that had me wondering why? I wanted to know right away. However, Sergio was on his own schedule as slowly, but surely, the layers of the story are revealed. The pacing reminded me a bit of Kill Bill. I figured Tarantino was a fan, and it turns out he is. Henry Fonda usually plays the good guy, but I really didn't know if his Frank or Charles Bronson's character was the good guy. Of course, good and bad are especially relative in cases like this! Charles Bronson doesn't have a name and IMDb lists him as Harmonica. He was played as a real mystery. A man with his own agenda, who didn't have problems killing anyone. He also played the harmonica with a wild tone that was pretty sweet. Due to the deliberate pacing of the movie there were a few times where I was on the edge of my seat. Waiting for what I thought should happen to hurry up and happen! Ultimately, the whole thing worked. The reveal of Harmonica's back story was a surprise.

450,20 November 2002,Brogan,10, The best Western of all time.,"I didn't originally care much of any Western genre films.  It wasn't until I sat down and watched all of Clint Eastwood's masterpiece, UNFORGIVEN, when it first came out, that I began to discover what a excellent genre the Western films were.  I saw that at the end of the film that Eastwood dedicated UNFORGIVEN to ""Sergio (Leone) and Don (Siegal)."" I then watched and began falling in love with Sergio Leone's films, FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, THE GOOD THE BAD & THE UGLY, FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE, etc.  But it wasn't until I watched ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, did I realize I found my favorite Western. To me, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is not only my favorite Sergio Leone film, but my favorite Western of all time.  It has the most original characters, a very well done story, fantastic direction, and the most beautiful score of all time.  For me, WEST is the achievement of Leone's career, it was the only Western film Leone directed that was actually shot in America, at Mounument Valley, the location of several of John Ford westerns. I find all of the characters in WEST to be original and different. Jill (Claudia Cardinale), the prostitute who is settling down for a new life until she finds out her husband, Brett McBain (Frank Wolff) and his children were murdered.  Cheyenne (Jason Robards) the outlaw who actually has a good soul inside of him that loves Jill and does whatever he can to help her. Harmonica (Charles Bronson) the man who expresses his vengence and pain by playing the harmonica , but is also very quick with his gun.  Then there's Frank (Henry Fonda), my favorite role in Fonda's career as well as my favorite villian of all time.  A villian so cold and vicious, a man who uses witty remarks and shows his evil personality by killing anyone who get in his way.  But it's not just Frank with the witty remarks, but also Harmonica and Cheyenne give some memorable lines as well. The story, written by Leone, shows the talented director use of creativity. The story was also co-written by Dario Argento, who would later become a legend himself the Italian horror genre, notably with SUSPIRIA. And co-written by Bernardo Bertolucci, who has done directed modern Italian neo-realism films like THE CONFORMIST, 1900, and THE LAST EMPEROR.",

Leone's previous westerns to this one are good, especially the masterful Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, but this one really is his true masterwork and pretty much the final word in westerns. Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven was a superb sort of ""send off"" for the genre, in terms of fairly traditional westerns, OUATITW is simply the towering achievement of what feels like lifetimes of work. An amazing film. One of those ""you must see this before you die"" type of thing. It also showcases the brilliance of Ennio Morricone, yet again. All the talent involved just really came together for a colossal project..something that really humbles all that came before it and, as many have said, you will never see this again. Tarantino's Kill Bill comes close in terms of being an homage to past cinema (which this film was intended to be, to a certain degree), but the sharp dramatics and stunning originality are just impossible to imitate.

The real subject of the movie is other westerns. This is a film that proves the impossibility of the western surviving the screen and brings it all to a lovely and noble end.

But with a big budget and a new vision (a trilogy that would culminate in ""Once Upon A Time in America""), Leone makes a film of his very own that stands even with the best of Kurosawa's or anyone else's. New Orleans ""lady"" Jill(Cardinale, never more beautiful) inherits a patch of worthless, empty desert in the path of an approaching railroad & suddenly finds that she's of great interest to tubercular railroad baron Morton (Ferzetti), his icy hired gun Frank (Fonda), aging bandit Cheyenne (Robards) and a shadowy, harmonica-tooting drifter (Bronson). Long as a summer's day & detailed as the Cistine Chapel, the film never wavers from its sad, beautiful theme: the fall of the free, rugged, wild Old West to the inexorable onslaught of machines, finance, and Order. Despite long stretches of magnificently photographed silence & the presence of the taciturn Bronson, this Western is surprisingly talkative. It wallows a little, as when Cheyenne tells Jill about his mother (give us a break), or when Frank & the drifter discuss the inhumanity of capitalism (wanna read ""The Communist Manifesto"" 'round the campfire tonight, fellas?). Most of the dialog, though, is as colorfully illustrative as the brilliant Techniscope photography, which depicts Monument Valley better than even John Ford's best (Ford never put Claudia Cardinale in the middle of it, did he?). Lionel Stander, who gave so many fine performances in countless low-budget flicks, finally gets a movie worthy of his unique talent. The always excellent Robards sets the tone of the film as the world-weary badman who see his Old West world rapidly shrinking. Peckinpah's outlaws face the same doom in the contemporary, less lush & more thrilling ""Wild Bunch."" Ferzetti's Morton, though dying in body, represents unstoppable, industrialized civilization & the invisible but matchless might of money (""Almost like holdin' a gun,"" Frank tells us, ""only much more powerful""). In his only bad-guy role (unless you count ""On Golden Pond""), Fonda creates what might be the most chilling Western blackguard ever. It's a wonder that the greatest Western villains were played by atypical stars, including roly-poly Burl Ives in ""The Big Country"" & all-American John Wayne in ""Red River."" Fonda's Frank outdoes them both. The film's end after its magnificent, gripping climax drags on too long & descends into sappiness. But the long, nearly wordless opening scene (veteran characters Elam & Strode) is one of the best starts to any movie, using only photography, sound & minimal physical action to set a tone of both comic laziness & slowly building anticipation. Morricone's score is as impressive as any of his others, more haunting than usual & dated with a very '60s electric guitar. Even with Leone's sardonic humor (Cheyenne's comment on the rate of inflation since Judas betrayed Christ is classic), this film shares the thoughtful tone of Ford or Mann Westerns, as well as that of ""Once Upon a Time in America,"" rather than the trademark ghostly wryness of Leone's other Westerns, including the subsequent ""Duck, You Sucker."" But it's also one of those all-day, luscious escapes that Italian filmmakers (and sort-of Italians, like ""Godfather"" Coppola) seem to do better than anyone. Among Westerns or any movies, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a once-in-a-lifetime classic.",

Death isn't always a clean one shot in the head or billion dollar special effects extravaganza. Sometimes it is small, sometimes not always instant. The film is slowly dying as are the main characters and it is beautiful to behold. It does move slowly. It need do nothing else, that is its style and it would work no other way.

The direction is flawless, i find myself every time i watch it, in awe of the beauty of the landscapes the discomfort of the extreme close-up. All the acting is excellent. For all those people who complained about the acting in this film I say this. Acting is living truthfully under imaginary circumstances. That is how one should judge acting. All actors portrayed perfectly the emotional journey all were one. Bronson, saying little thought-out the film, but in his eyes we see his pain and his cold calculated plan of assassination. This film could not be overrated. The only argument with this film is which is better: this, or the good, the bad, and the ugly. Personally I think this is the better. Both are incredible, hands down. But for me, the title sequence and Henry Fonda's performance tip the scales in once upon a time's favour. Watch this film and be blown away. Oh one last thing, a reviewer said that the western is an American style of movie. Well, I'm not a big fan of the john Wayne stuff personally. But fair enough, he and john ford have made their mark, but the dollars trilogy and this have made at least an equal contribution to the western AND to film.",

There's very little dialogue, but the sounds and the camera shots tell the story and give you a atmosphere not often felt during movies.  It's too bad more directors don't follow Sergio's lead here and give their films so much feeling and atmosphere.  All done with a fly, dripping water and some creaking wood. To end the fabulous opening, the line ""No. You brought two too many!"", gives you an suspenseful anticipation of what is to come next.",

482,15 June 2020,iccmulan,8, Great,This is my fav film. It is more like watching a piece of art. The look is fantastic. The director does a perfect job. The acting is wonderful. The story is not the strongest ever but it should be watched to experience it. If your a film lover you can't fail but admire this film.Charles Bronson is the perfect broody loner. Henry Fonda surprises everyone by giving a strong performance as a bad guy. The close up of his eyes is stunning. The camera work and close ups have never been done better. The music is as good as anything you will find in a movie. Throw in the scenes when you first see Henry Fonda. The scene at the railway station which the water dripping on the hat. The sound of the spinning water tower. To me the closet movie to ART i have ever seen and i have seen a lot of films.,
483,28 May 2003,Board,8," Bad-ass, but could have been just a liiitle bit better...","Contains spoilers!! Most of the westerns I've seen was when I was a kid and my father saw them on tv and I found them all terribly boring, but this one stands as the best western I've seen! What made this good for me, I guess was the plot. When the climax came I thought to myself ""Goddamn, this is evil stuff! Great movie! The best old movie I've seen (except for Chaplin's ""Limelight"" of course, which is the best movie I've ever seen)!!"". What dragged it a bit down was that it dragged a bit out after that. I think it could have still maintained the ""great"" position if it had just ended after the shoot-out or when Harmonica came into the house and said he had to leave. I didn't really need to see his companion, who also had to leave, die. I didn't feel anything for that guy, so that was just a bit irrelevant. It still stands as one of the best older movies I've seen though. ""Casablanca"" still tops it though, I guess (and of course ""Limelight""). I also feel that this is one of those movies where the music and the images came together perfectly! I sat several times with goosebumps when seeing this movie, although I knew Morricone's ""The man with the harmonica"" when I saw the film (I have the song myself). I usually use a 6 point star system when rating movies and stuff and 4 is for a good movie and that translates to 6,66 on a 10-point scale, but I'll be generous and give it an 8! It could have gotten a 9 if it didn't drag out at the end.",
484,23 September 1999,Dave-430,10, The best western. One of the ten best movies ever.,"I rate Once Upon a Time in The West among my ten favorite movies of all time. The masterful way Sergio Leone conducts  mood, atmosphere and pace is without equal, and his presentation of the main characters is brilliant. Thus Charles Bronson delivers the performance of his life as the man with the harmonica, Jason Robards is a pleasure to watch as the anti-hero Cheyenne and Henry Fonda is brilliantly cast as perhaps the most evil villain in movie history.

An hour in and still only about five minutes worth of plot has happened and you are still no closer to understanding what the movie is about or why anything has happened. The worst part is that no human in history has behaved like any character in this movie. People don't stand and stare for minutes before talking to each other and then say one or two words that don't mean anything but somehow say everything. Obviously a lot of people like this movie but for me, I have no interest in having to start the movie up again over three or four night due to falling asleep watching a fly crawl around a person's face or a woman stare at herself in the mirror for a minute for no good reason. Sometimes the ends don't justify the slow, boring, absurd means.",

But in fact, Once Upon a Time in the West is a lot more than just a Western. And in a way, I don't even call it a Western, it's a genre of it's own kind. But by now I've seen and respect more of the Western genre, from films like Sergio Leone's ""Dollars Trilogy: A Fistfull of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"", The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The Man Who Sho Liberty Valance and a couple others.

491,18 March 2020,Mnemosyne15,8, One of the best martial arts films in the West,"One of the reasons why film thinking is different from other artistic thinking is that film does not need to be described, and it does not need to be processed by other media and communication methods. The camera can directly and completely record this complete space and movement in space, but literature must describe It is the same with all kinds of details, sculpture, and fine arts. Only the movie is closer to the original reality, and the movie is closer to life. He can really show the details of life directly. This is why Bazan said that film art does not imitate reality, but reality imitates film. What he meant was that film directly created reality, which also led to different ways of thinking between film and literature, film processing and literary processing It's quite different. Film only intercepts and does not need to describe encoding and conversion. What about literature? If you are interested, you can think about how to use the lens to express the scene of the rice dumplings I described earlier, how to express it in words, and see if the way of thinking is different.
Furthermore, in terms of authenticity, films are also fictional, but they are also fictional. Films have a closer life-like realism, repainting and painting, sculptures are made more lifelike, and literary depiction is not as immersive as realism. The movie is closer to reality, although everyone is fake. Of course, this is only more realistic, and authenticity is not the sole purpose of art.",

Everything is perfectly combined to make for an amazing film that you cannot take your eyes off, even through some of the slower moments early on. The acting was absolutely superb, the directing magnificent, the plot amazing. The best part of this film for me was the music though. Every second of music played is essential to the film as a whole and to the moment that it is being played at. The harmonica is sublime, every time I hear it a chill just runs through my spine waiting to see what is going to happen. As a youngster of 19 this film is quite a bit ahead of my time, but even someone who is watching it for the first time 30+ years after it was released can instantly see that this is one of the all time great films ever made. I cannot point to one second of the film where I think to myself that it is not essential to the film as a whole. Finding older movies to watch is not the easiest thing in the world, and some of the other great classics just don't fit my taste. For me though this is a new age film that is 30 years old. I cannot believe how anyone who grew up in the era of this can not put it near the top of their all time movie list.

""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" illustrated the misers enabling an ethically ambiguous Eastwood to appear in good light; the amazing thing is that with our chasm to this, he is the best character in the movie as far as moral compass is concerned and realising this consciously is weird for me as he is a swindler and ruffian and yet with those qualities, he still manages to weigh on our empathy with him; this is what really gives him that perplexity and enigma that is so grounded in these movies.",

If it had strayed more to typical Western tropes it would have been a winner. I get what it was trying to do, but for me was not engaging.

The European audience, however, was enthralled and charmed by this unique artistic work. In German, Leone's Italo-Western has a much more appropriate title which would translate as ""Play me the tune of death"". Indeed, the storyline is quite capturing: A lonesome harmonica player (Charles Bronson) ends up in a final showdown with his arch-enemy Frank, who shot down a woman's (Claudia Cardinale) family to make profit in the Mid-West. The spectator is thrilled right from the first moment - not only by the powerful dialogs and gunfights, but by the poetic scenery and imagery. One has to admit that the movie would only have turned out half as good without Ennio Morricone's beautiful music which imparts a somehow romantic and epic touch. Along with that, Claudia Cardinale plays the amazing part of an unbreakable, totally intrepid widow. Leone's directing style consists of ellipses which he applied perfectly to enhance suspense and to allow silent dialog and emotion through eye contact.

530,9 November 2011,loogenhausen,10, Harmonicas At High Noon...,"OUATITW takes place in a weird part of American history. With that said, it's not even a bit ironic that a visionary Italian filmmaker orchestrated it all. Director Sergio Leone had done it before, of course, with the classic ""Man With No Name trilogy"" featuring western vet Clint Eastwood. But OUATITW is a completely different animal compared to the Eastwood series. While that pulpy, hard-boiled trilogy feels raw and uncontrollable at every turn, OUATITW is much more epic and somber in feeling. The best parts here are Ennio Morricone's terrific score and cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli's rich and haunting capture of the red and dusty Wyoming landscape. The story revolves around five characters who cross paths with each other throughout the film: Harmonica (Charles Bronson) is a wandering vigilante, playing his harmonica more than he talks and on the hunt for Frank (Henry Fonda). Frank's a cruel, heartless monster of a man that kills without any feeling or remorse and just so happens to be in league with railroad tycoon Morton (Gabrielle Ferzetti) in a land-snatching plot involving the inheritance of Jill (Claudia Cardinale), a big-city girl thrust into the wild west, now alone and struggling to simply stay alive. Last but not least, there's the dangerous but lovable bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards), fresh out of captivity and ready to swing things his way, whatever the cost. The expansion of the railroad is the key element of this story. The ghosts of westerns past haunt the proceedings as the money of the railroad barons and thirst of the land developers evaporate the mystery and beauty of the frontier. Morricone cleverly composed a distinct score for each of the five main characters, with Harmonica's being the most intimidating, Frank's the most conflicted, Jill's the most tender, Morton's the saddest and Cheyenne's the most deviously playful. It adds a whole new level to the film and will leave you humming Cheyenne's theme long after the movie is over.",

Such is this film from Sergio Leone...a definite classic, one that will be in your memory long after you see it.

He gambled with going against type and portrays a rather evil character) which undoubtedly pays off and his performance (I would say) is absolutely mesmerizing. I read from the pamphlet included inside the DVD cover that Sergio concentrates a lot on facial expression close-ups....every detail is visible.

The opening sequence, for example, stretches to the point of unbearability.  Something is about to happen but we don't know what, or when, and the suspense and tension grows with every passing second of near silence.

543,3 January 2013,amathubagoldhq,10, Shakespearean Poetry in the Wild West,"In true poetic form Sergio Leone combines all the basic characteristics of classical theater into the dusty, sandy desert of the Wild West. We have tragedy, romance, revenge, comedy and mankind's eternal fight between good and evil. The good guys, despite their suffering always win and the bad guys always get punished or gunned down in bloody gun battle! While sweat runs down each opponent's brow and eyes are twitching; coarse fingers reach for loaded pistols in the sweltering desert sun. Leone has chosen the perfect bad guy in Henry Fonda as he plays the uncouth villain who has lost his soul and staggers through life leaving pain wherever he leaves. Charles Bronson on the other hand the good guy, with a heart of stone, never flinching always standing up against the evil which he has been chasing since his childhood. Protecting all those in his path including the beautiful Claudia Cardinale Bronson plays a superb role, right until the final climatic challenge between him and Fonda. The background music keeps you on the edge of your seat feeling each emotion with each actor; the acting is superb from both villain and hero and the emotions of each and every scene is portrait by Leone to perfection, the scenery and the cinematography are captivating from the drop of sweat which falls into the desert sand to horses chasing into the sunset. This film is the birth place of all modern Westerns.",

""Film buffs"" claim this pretentious, three hour bore-fest a better film than TGTBATU. Fortunately, the film had good aspects that save this movie from becoming trash. Bronson, Fonda, and Bobards play very interesting and likable characters that had my investment. The opening scene is the only moment in the movie that resembles the wit and style of the Dollars trilogy. Plus the soundtrack is really good. The bad part is, the plot is SO predictable, which doesn't help its three hour running time and extremely slow pace. Claudia Cardinale is just beauty. She doesn't do much which sucks because she's the ""lead"". If you want good Leone films, stick with the Dollars trilogy(1964-66), Duck You Sucker!(1971), and Once Upon A Time In America(1984).",

As the villain Frank, Henry Fonda gives Lee Van Cleef a run for his money as the most ominous Leone villain.Charles Bronson's Harmonica could take the man with no name anyday, while Claudia Cardinale plays one of cinemas great female characters in Jill McBain. The real star in my opinion is Jason Robards ""Cheyenne"" a character with a real sense of longing for the love of Jill McBain. (It's a wonder Robards wasn't in more high profile roles) All in All ""The west"" rivals once upon a time in America as my favourite Leone film.",
553,8 November 2013,morlock9,7, Almost great but for the miscasting,"The amazing cinematographic touch of Leone is there, and his flawless capture of the grit and grandeur that MUST have been the west of 150 years ago is worth the price of admission alone. But amidst this visual feast are flaws that prevented a higher score from me. The first is the plot itself, which revolves around a woman, a ""former"" prostitute, and her three lovers- all of whom are major characters in the film who battle each other in some form or another. Actually, I read this afterward on IMDb. You could have fooled me on that one. Women have no place in a Leone western to begin with, and Claudia simply did not have the acting range to pull it off. She was in a lot of scenes but I never thought of her as the focus of the film. Sophia Loren cast in the role might have brought a magnetic quality to the woman, perhaps, but not Claudia. Which comes to the miscasting. With Leone's star firmly in the ascendant, it is clear that all of Hollywood wanted in on this one, and Sergio obliged, to the detriment of the movie. Jason Robards, as a commenter already noted, is dreadful as Cheyenne. He brings nothing to the movie and his hang-dog acting style is irritating and tiresome. Bronson as the protagonist Harmonica is too short and ethnic looking to be convincing as a tough guy. And the harmonica playing ""hook"" of the movie is laughable, though it makes some convoluted sense at the end of the movie. Hey, a tough guy has to be ready to draw his gun at ALL times. If you play a harmonica, not only do you use two hands, but you must concentrate on the melody. Just didn't work for me. The main theme was superb, but the secondary theme- where the banjo is being plucked in a jaunty tune- was out of place and WAY overused. Other plot holes are where the heck did McBain get the money to build a big house and purchase lumber and supplies to build an entire town? And if he had money, why would he marry a New Orleans prostitute? So a great movie, for it is a Leone, but with many, many flaws.",

The pace is slow and deliberate, building the tension through close-ups of faces through which the story is communicated without the use of words. But, Leone can pull back into wide-shots of panoramas and vistas of great beauty. Sound is extremely important in creating and conveying the tension as well: the sudden silence of crickets, the monotony of a turning windmill, the crash of waves of an imagined ocean.

To sum up with more clarity, Sergio Leone made me learn to appreciate films that chooses to take its time, where all the little subtleties are the ones that add the most richness to a film's quality.

The plot was so paper thin, yet they revealed it so slowly and so convolutedly that I found myself wondering what the heck was even happening most of the time. By the end I had more questions than answers (only because the story is full of plot holes). There were very few action scenes (not that a good western needs them), the characters were boring, unrelatable, unrealistic, clichés, and the dialogue was few, far between, and didn't even relate to what was happening on screen. They would spend 10 minutes talking about random things, just to fill in time for a conversation that could have been said in a few sentences. The acting was terrible to mediocre at best and I can't really blame the stars for them not having a good script to read. Like I said, this movie was LONG (over three hours) and most of that time was just close ups of peoples faces and stylistic camera angles. When the action did happen, it was as clichéd and fake as it gets; I really can't believe that people act like this film is so unique when it did the same things as most other westerns of the time only in a more boring fashion. The only good things about it were that it had an awesome soundtrack (reminded me of Red Dead Redemption), but it was forced in at odd moments, the scenery was beautiful, and the sets were put together well.

There are moments that strain one's patience, particularly the operatic music style. And Jason Robards could have enunciated less like a stage actor. And having to watch Gabriele Ferzetti move at a snail's pace due to his crippled condition. But no one has ever used the camera more lovingly than Sergio Leone, even in the midst of supreme tension. Seeing this on a truly big screen when it came out in 1969 was an incredible movie-going experience. The all-time greatest role for Charles Bronson, and one of Henry Fonda's favorites ever, despite being such a ""bad"" bad guy.",

As cinematic genre very rapidly evolved in the 1960s to reflect better real ""human behaviour"", this allowed Leone to produce characters that were the embodiment of the West. Neither black, nor white, neither good, nor bad, just a mix of both. This typifies heroes such as ""Harmonica"" who is really after a personal vendetta, and Cheyenne, who is really after some sort of ill-rewarded redemption. The American west was gray, like its characters, with stories of heroism and moral decadence. No other movie presents this dilemma better as Once Upon a Time.",

Before making my next comment, I will make a point of saying I absolutely love the good the bad and the ugly and I was born in the 70s just to make the point that this is Not a complete youngster talking, this film however was utterly boring bilge with a completely dull story line which Sergio leone thought would have been improved by far too many boring silences and stares, it didn't work!!!

She loved ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" mostly because of the score. But this is a seminal and empowering woman's film. Cardinale arrives fully aware of the risks she takes, the uncertainty she faces, and when the tragedy of the first onslaught occurs, she reconfigures in a heartbeat.

All of the performances are excellent- Claudia Cardinale as a world-weary former prostitute, Jason Robards as a romantic ""half-breed"" bandit, Charles Bronson as a quiet, vengeful vigilante, and Henry Fonda as a sadistic hit man.

I was not following the story with eagerness.to many of these guys look to much alike where I cant remember whos supposed to be the bad guy and whos supposed to be the good guy.chares bronsons harmonica was a good tune setting the first time it was in the movie but it plays over and over again through out the movie countless times. making it played out and no good anymore. the close ups on Charles bronsons face and peter fonda are also in the same category at first its good cinematic detail but then time after time again and again its too much .Now the good of this movie for being made in 1968 the picture quality is great the sets are really good the ambiance I feel it dose a really good job of taking you back to the old west its like your really there. Claudia cardinale .this movie was made 15 years before I was born.and I watched the whole thing so maybe 5 stars no 4 stars final answer,
609,23 January 2016,tyrone-superman,5, Painfully slow and too long,"I went into this movie with high expectations having enjoyed some of Sergio Leone's other 'classics' like 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, however this fell well short. The movie has a storyline that is not overly entertaining and one I feel could have been cut significantly shorter. I found myself many times throughout the movie just wanting it to reach some sort of climax and end because it was boring me. Obviously the scenery was epic and there were some amazing shots - which is standard with Leone's work - but this movie just did not do it for me. The movie still managed to gain a 6 star rating from me based simply upon the directing and strong performances from Fonda, Bronson and Cardinale. If the movie was 45 minutes to an hour shorter I'm sure it could still have told the story just as well - probably better because viewers would not face so many dull moments - and rated much higher for me.",

614,7 October 1999,mike-970,10, The best Western Ever,"""Once Upon A Time In The West"" towers above all other westerns and stands as Sergio Leone's ultimate masterpiece, which is weighty considering the canon of his work. Though I'm partial to Rutger Hauer in ""Bladerunner"" I give complete respect to Henry Fonda as the greatest villian in the movies for his portrayal of Frank. Villianny is easy, but this sort of cold, ruthless, calculating character is a once in a career opportunity. Take particular note of his entrance the first time he appears. Some of you may notice a similarity to this scene in 1977 by George Lucas when we are first introduced to Darth Vader. Whether it was intentional or not, you should be reminded of it. One of the truly brilliant aspects of this film is the interaction between the characters. No one completely trusts anyone. This is particularly strong is the relationship of Cheyanne (Jason Robards) and Harmonica (Charles Bronson). The first time they meet is tense, almost frightening. The greatest contribution this film made to the movies is the score by Ennio Morricone. It is his best, and unquestionably one fo the best scores ever. You will see how music adds to the action, how symbolic it can be. Without spoiling the movie you'll find out the the harmonica music we hear throughout the film is a lot more important than just setting the mood. The heading sums up all I have to say about it: ""Once Upon a Time In the West"" is the best western ever and one of my top ten favorite films of all time.",
615,11 July 2003,pas_op_of_ik_gooi,10, Take a good look at the long shots!!,"This great movie is sometimes called slow. In my opinion it can not be long enough. Not all movies should be over in 90 minutes, while others are already boring from the first minute. It is clear that this movie is of the first category. Sergio Leone really took time for beautiful shots. Watch the scene in which Claudia Cardinale gets out of the train carefully. The shot starts when she gets out, and continues when she walks over the platform, through the railway station building, and out of it on the other side. All in one shot!!! The MTV-ation of the cinema is not always a good thing. It sometimes makes it more exciting, but the truly long, good shots should never be forgotten. Of course the long shots of Sergio Leone are backed up by the stunning music of the great composer Ennio Moricone. I know of no better director/composer duo.",

The slow pace, film score, majestic photography, superb acting, and inspired vision combine to make a spellbinding work that rivets you to the screen even when nothing is happening.

Once Upon a Time in the West is in my top ten. Every now and then it will come to the Castro in San Francisco. The theater is always packed; the film always begins with loud applause, and always ends with a standing ovation.

Beautiful dialogues and very special actors. This movie is very impressive and there is much time to think not only about scenes, but about meaning of life and what aim life have. There is a man, who has to revenge, but without it (or that time, it is done) he don't know what to do. He don't know how to live (Harmonica). There is a woman, which is noble lady and bitch together (Jill). She's very real and symbolic as well (I apologize to all women, it is not about women). There is nice and kind outlaw (Cheyenne). He's like father of all outlaws. And there is evil - very charismatic evil, which leads to self-destruction (Frank). Very symbolic, very real. One of the best movies I have ever seen.",
623,15 April 2005,jphflyspy,10, Best sound track.,"This movie was done uniquely by playing the music themes during the filming rather than dubbing later. I don't know of another movie that used this technique. The sound track is a classic, one of the best ever. Each character plays an important role in exemplifying human character and traits especially in the time of the old west, therefore, the title, ""Once Upon a Time In The West"" is so appropriate. The movie carries one back to that time through their actions and the theme of the ever expanding railroad that took place during that time. There is heartbreak at times followed by success or fulfillment for some of the roles. There is good brought out in the ones who are portrayed as bad, such as Cheyenne. Also, in the end there is death for some, and like in real life everything is not a fairy tale ending. It is a true microcosm of that time in the west, and of the human nature of men and women. The sound track is one of the best ever. This movie can watched over and over again, and every times it can make one realize one's own mortality.",
624,2 April 2010,ace41095,10, The Greatest Western Of All Time.,"Sergio Leone is one of the greatest directors of all time that does need to be repeated, because it has been known now for decades. When it comes down too which of his films is the best. I would normally say ""The Good The Bad And The Ugly"" is his best film. But his best western is no doubt ""Once Upon A Time In The West"". The film opens with a man with no name, but he's often called in this film ""Harmonica"". Charles Bronson one of the toughest true men to ever grace Hollywood pictures plays harmonica. He actually doesn't speak as often as you would think, but I personally think that's his style. Always quiet, with that serious look on his face. Opposite Charles Bronson is Jason Robarts as Cheyenne. I love his personality. He just has a fun time messing with people especially Harmonica never taking him seriously, but as the film continues on, his relationship with Harmonica improves, and he even saves his life, ""In one of the best train scenes ever captured on film"". But my personal favorite is Henry Fonda as Frank the main villain of the film. Frank is ruthless; he doesn't care about anyone except himself. He also hates Harmonica, he has the opportunity to kill him many times through out the film but he doesn't, Frank always keeps you guessing. And in turn Harmonica even saves his life. The final scene is one of the most epic scenes ever. Harmonica and Frank stand off against one another. I don't have a lot of time to mention much more of the cast but I will say they are all perfect. The soundtrack is also fantastic, but you can be the judge of that for yourself. Just to sum it up, with an amazing cast, beautiful soundtrack, and a great director, this is my pick for the greatest western of all time.",

I liked it better than those 3, but I won't argue with anyone if they liked any of those better, they are all good too. You can tell that Leone had a way larger budget for this movie, and it helps to bring the entire atmosphere to life. Charles Bronson's character is superb. Jason Robards character was funny/badass(My favorite character, and Henry Fonda...wow. Fonda was awesome! If you like movies that aren't all flash and dazzle actions like Face/Off or the Bad Boys series (This is no knock on those movies cause I like those too) then you will like this movie. Leone shows how he is one of the best directors in history with this movie. It is definitely worth picking up to own; I found it at a local store for 12 dollars. One of the best buys I ever made.

Fortunately (for us viewers), in 1968 nobody wanted Leone to do anything but Westerns. So he agreed to do one more. But this would not be just another western, no. This would be the film to summarise all his feelings about the Western - the death of the Western from the man who gave it new life. It would be Once Upon A Time In The West.",

The two most touching parts of the movie for me is close to the end of the movie, when Harmonica (Bronson) is staring out the door after he's killed Frank (Fonda), and Claudia Cardinale asks him if he'll be back one day -Bronson turns, stares with intensity at Cardinale for a second or two, and says ""someday"" you know he's never coming back.. it's the look on Bronson's face.. another touching moment is when Jason Robards pats Claudia Cardinale on the butt suggesting some of the railroad workers who have not seen a pretty woman in a long while might do the same, and that she should tolerate it -I got the sense of the basic decency of Robard's character, a killer & robber, but lovable in his own way.

If you're looking for an action film, then you've come to the wrong place. This is a heavy, methodic drama with some superior acting from some of Hollywood's best. I won't go into the storyline because I'm sure that you've already read that much by now. Just be prepared to take your time soaking in this film as it plays out before you. Because believe me when I tell you, the director takes his time setting up the mood in every scene. If you haven't the time or patience for that kind of film, well then all I can say is, it's your loss. This film is a classic. The acting is excellent as well as everything else about this movie.

Now, to answer a qouestion I know many of you are asking in your own thoughts without daring to pronounce the actual words: Is this piece of cinematic art better than The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly? I personally think it's pretty darned close if they're not actually equal. Everything is here, the tension, the soundtrack, the epic story and the contrasting characters, and what separates this brilliant western from good and average ones, as Sergio Leone knows, is the mystical element that tends to make its self known quite often. In my personal opinion, a great western ( and I am a huge fan of the perticular jenre ) is not just about robbing trains, or cowboys versus indians, you have to feel a world is about to die, and watching this movie I have felt just that. Of course, much of the credit must also go to the cast, and I think everyone was at their best in the roles they were given. I will just mention Charles Bronson because he is in fact the main character and also because I began collecting and enjoying his whole work on the silver screen. Overall a 9 out of 10 in my book.",

Once Upon A Time is actually a continuation of Leone's exploration of the American frontier. It's also his most hopeful film leaving the audience with the message that the time for gunslinging is over and where nation building must begin - Cardinale delivering water to the railway workers. The beauty of the film is in the conflicted way it tells us this; like Peckinpah's Wild Bunch, Frank and Harmonica know their time is up and there's a huge mutual respect between them in their final duel. I don't think I've ever seen a duel like it: absolutely supercharged with emotion. I do agree that the film could have used a cut here or there but I'm not sure where as there isn't a scene I can think of that doesn't push the story forward. I'd love to have seen Eastwood doing Harmonica but Bronson fills in well. As for Fonda, one of the best pieces of counter-casting I've seen. Pure cinema.",

Does he hill the boy ? We'll you've got to watch the film. This is possibly one of the greatest opening to any movie.

640,9 March 2006,tnhelliott,9, Sweeping and epic.,"A masterpiece of sound and vision. The use of shadow and music in this film to heighten emotion and character is sheer brilliance. The limited dialogue only adds to the tension of this picture. More is said with action and sound then with words. I still get goose-pimples during Chuck Bronson's first scene. The slow shots of peoples faces and their reactions to events is a nice touch. The genius of the writing is shown during the scene in the bar, where gunfighting is compared to music. Do not be mistaken, this movie is more than an ordinary western. This is movie is about the fundamental difference in good versus evil, in hate versus love, or survival versus revenge. There is more than meets the eye and this film shows that a western, or an action film, does not need to be gruesome and gory to be interesting and exciting. And it proves that an exciting film can pluck the heart-strings just as any story of star crossed lovers can. The Writing and directing and the music are all there, not too mention the action. Henry Fonda plays the darkest meanest character in his career and Charles Bronson, as his foil and opposite, is stunning to watch. It is my belief that Charles Bronson is a very underrated actor and Sergio Leone simply did not make enough Films. If you are a fan of the western and of movies that require an active part from their audience, check this one out...you won't be disappointed.",
641,15 January 2001,noledge,8, The Forth Best Western Ever....,".... Ranking only behind Leone's Dollars Trilogy. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' features a great cast, featuring Henry Fonda as the cold-blooded villain, Charles Bronson as the mysterious 'Harmonica' and Claudia Cardinale as the widowed Jill McBain. The direction is amazing, with Leone really taking the best bits from all westerns such as show downs, greed, and deep character development. Ennio Morricone's beautifull score is one of his best to date, even beating out his more famous 'The Good, the bad and the Ugly' theme. The film is long, but you hardly notice it, as Leone uses time and space brilliantly.",

The soundtrack from the late Ennio Morricone is predictably great. It's not as outlandish as some of his others but runs beautifully throughout the film. The cast are all good.

While these statements could be used to describe Once Upon a Time in the West, they are not the only reasons to appreciate it. The casting and acting are superb. Claudia Cardinale is gorgeous. The cinematography is incredible. The music is perfect. If Sergio Leone were alive and making this movie in the 21st century I don't think he would have changed a thing (except maybe the voice dubbing). Westerns were so formulaic and non-artistic before the Italians came and started writing and directing. This movie is the ultimate timeless example of the potential of this genre.

He could not only kill someone with his power but silence Morricone is just like a God here with his presence in terms of music and Bronson the ultimate 'Harmonica'. Look at him in the first glance and one will find the reality in his character as portrayed by Bronson since his presence and throughout. This movie really touches heart with story, awesome direction, of course the heavenly music ( by Morricone), super negative role by Fonda and the silence of Bronson. O God! if we had him (Charles Bronson) now he would have certainly created havoc. Just unforgettable!!",

Just like my favourite movie, Stanley Kubrick's ""2001-A space Odyssey"" you become aware of the real meaning of going to a cinema: Not to hear endless mono-, dia-, or multilogs, but to see pictures; pictures never seen before, which you will remember even if you haven't seen it for years.

The Music and cinematography is simply perfect the directing is different than any other movie i have ever seen!!! Leone spaghetti westerns are special but this movie is so much more and several notches above his other efforts! I have watched many movies over my life and this movie has never been topped! I love this Film!!!! and can watch it over and over again! You may be turned off by the slow start of this movie but be patient while you are waiting for it to develop look at the artistic way Leone brings in his audience long spans with few words said. The way his characters always enter from the right side of the frame the close ups of they're faces so close you can see the pores in the characters faces, and many times the characters say nothing but you know what they are thinking. Notice how after the shoot out in town Frank (Fonda) is Riding back to the Train and his Horses gallop is in perfect rhythm with the music. To truly appreciate the magnitude of this film,just look at the votes it has received only sixty thousand votes on IMDb and it still ranks in the top 20 now compare the Shawshank Redemption Which by the way is also one of my favorites... it has over 400,000 votes( as of june 30th 2009) and is currently ranked number one. Once Upon A Time In the West is 18th which is amazing considering it only has 60,000 votes compared to the Shawshank Redemption which has over 400,000 votes. What this means is that most everyone that watches Once Upon A time in the west give it a number 10 score, and there are another 340,000 people on this site that has not even viewed this film yet do your self a favor and watch this Masterpiece!

671,30 January 2016,pennyfarthinggamestudios,6, Some moments of pure brilliance alas not maintained.,"I went into this movie hoping for great things. I had already seen and loved Once upon a time in America and the Dollars trilogy and was hoping for another superb Leone film. To some extent this is what I got. There are some scenes in this movie that are sublime. The opening scene as they wait for the train is close to perfection as the deadly quiet is only interrupted by the small quirks of the environment it leaves you on tenterhooks. The same is true of the later scene at the house when all seems well but occasionally we see McBain's uneasy glances when he hears small noises. The score is by Ennio Morricone so it goes without saying that it is superb.The plot is also interesting and complex, it twists and turns as we attempt to decipher what the big game is that all these men are fighting over and yet the final twist (as to the nature of Harmonica and Frank's relationship) feels contrived and forced and comes too late in the movie for the animosity which has been present throughout to have meaning. If we had understood their relationship earlier on it would have lent more weight to their interactions (particularly where Harmonica saves Frank's life). It would also have had the effect of making the characters less bland. Blondie worked in the fistful trilogy because although he displayed few emotions, he was able to be sarcastic and fun too. Here it seems Leone wanted the next Blondie but Harmonica's character is boring, he sullenly fails to emote throughout the whole film even in scenes that should be of real emotion for the character (when he is facing off against the man who did so much to him at a younger age) he remains in his bored expression. If he doesn't seem to care about anything why should we. The other characters are not much stronger, their motives seeming to change on a dime (as with Cheyenne who is at one moment intimidating and hostile and the next best friends with Harmonica and Claudia.) Claudia's character is the worst though. The writer seems to have made an effort for her to be a strong character, but she becomes a tedious damsel in distress and has a confusing relationship with Harmonica (who is at one minute trying to rape her then the next protecting her from Frank's thugs???) All this adds up to a film that could have been brilliant but squandered this through its characters and it's failure to make its big plot twist at the end count for anything by deploying it in a way that doesn't feel token and forced.",

The violence of several scenes may prove unnerving to some, but seem secondary, although quite in keeping with the classic mythological characters that represent the popular stereotypes of western cinema.

Sergio Leone was brilliant in this regard and should be up among the top directors of the the last century.

Things are set in motion, before the film starts, that can only reach one end - death, for most of the characters. Delli Colli's lensing is so beautiful, like paintings from a master.

Every time I watched it after that more of the depth of the characters and story became clear, as it masterfully unfolds bit by bit through every scene.

This film will take you into the dreams of Leone, and while you're watching it, you wont bother pinching yourself to wake up because the dream is so damn cool. I think people who don't understand this film want more pop art, that's the reason they keep bringing up Leone's earlier works, but this film is all about mood.

704,21 December 2008,spiritualfields,10, Transcendent,"The visual beauty of this movie, the superb acting, the universal themes, and the accompanying score underpin its greatness, but what makes it a truly great movie is the pacing. 'Slow' is how many reviewers describe the pace, but 'slow' implies that the pace could have been improved by a speeding up of the scenes. However, the pace is perfect. Rather than 'slow', I like to describe the scenes as being 'extended' (as opposed to exaggerated, extreme, or protracted, which, like 'slow', are words that imply imperfection). In Once Upon A Time In The West the action is extended over time intervals that allow the viewer to think and reflect and ponder on what is being observed. It's as if Leone has slowed down time, and what we reflect and ponder about is more than just the scene, which reflect an America that we never knew. But we know the themes of greed, lust, revenge, anger, despair, savage cruelty, regret, and loss, and those of us who have reached maturity and have decades of experience under our belt, also have memories of experiences that reflect those fundamental themes. And THAT is what tugs at our heartstrings (at least mine). The scenes are metaphors that stand in for own lives.",

As many people told before, Ennio Morricone made one of the best score ever. It's funny, that he wrote the score before Leone made the first picture of the movie.

Claudia Cardinale, Charles Bronson,Jason Robards and a villainous Henry Fonda star. The screenplay was co-written by future Italian film giant Bernardo Bertolucci. The film is audio edited in a way that even the dubbed-in voices of the actors are never a hindrance to the pace of the story.

The story is about a battle between a widow and a bad guy who are powerful and wealthy. The bad guy owned much railway and land meanwhile he wanted to get more land from a widow. Then a brave cowboy came to the small town where the widow lived. He helped the lady to fight with the bad guy and at last they won. This movie is about cowboy and frontier life. The life in the small town is hardly and there are few laws and rules to control people. The most important thing in the west was land and many people will even kill people for land. At the beginning of the movie I can guess what mood the movie will be. The director gave me a beautiful but cruelty scene and the whole movie was in that kind of mood. The cowboy who helped the widow is definitely macho. He was mysterious and had enough power to protect himself as well as people who needed his help like the widow. He was also very callous. At last the beautiful widow fell in love with the cowboy and asked the cowboy to stay with her. However, the callous cowboy said no. Then while the lady asked him when would you come back, he said ""someday"". His answer was cool and nothing. He was steady in mood and nothing can influence him. This movie is totally about what I learned from chapter four in American ways. In the movie we can see frontier life, self-reliance, rugged individualist, American macho heroes and can-do spirit. Especially the hero is very typical. He demonstrated his strength through physical violence in the movie. He fought against the man who controlled the small town. He was physically tough and rugged by the conditions of frontier life. He appeared and disappeared alone.
