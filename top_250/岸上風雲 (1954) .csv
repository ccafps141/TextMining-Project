0,4 May 2008,Nazi_Fighter_David,10," Kazan's film constitutes an extraordinary tour de force of fluid direction and nervous, edgy acting","""On the Waterfront"" is basically the story of one man, Terry Malloy, a young dock worker with a little, and unsuccessful, experience as a boxer but not much intelligence or purpose He wastes his time around the docks, vaguely discontented about his life and revealing a tender trace in his otherwise tough manner as he tends his pigeons caged on the roof of his modest building ",/
1,4 May 2012,ma-cortes,8," Powerful portrait of N.Y. docks , being stunningly performed and excellently directed by Elia Kazan","This compelling and dynamic drama is set on New York's dock where mobsters control the Union and stevedores . An ex-prize fighter named Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando who deservedly won an Academy Award) turned longshoreman struggles to stand up to his corrupt union bosses (Lee J Cobb) and is embroiled in violence . Malloy faces the terrible dilemma of whether or not to turn informer . While his brother (it was originally offered to Lawrence Tierney , but he asked for too much money so the role went to Rod Steiger who was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance) is a crooked lawyer and he meets a beautiful ex-nun (Eva Maria Saint , Grace Kelly turned down the role of Edie Doyle, deciding to make Rear Window instead) and falls in love for her .",r
2,31 March 2008,ExpendableMan,9, A classic for all the right reasons,"Watching On The Waterfront nowadays, two scenes stand out head and shoulders above the rest. First is the impassioned speech by Father Barry (Karl Malden) to the gathered dock workers in the hull of a ship where he tries to rally them against the mobsters running their lives. Second is the confrontation between Terry and Charlie Malloy (Marlon Brando and Rod Steiger) in the back of a taxi which ends in one brother pointing a gun at the other and Brando's now legendary ""contender speech."" Both of them are sequences where the characters do nothing but talk but each is a fine example of what makes On The Waterfront the undeniable classic it is; acting, scripting, cinematography, music, everything fits into one cohesive whole and the end result is a welcome addition to any film collection.",e

(Edmund Burke) The evil in 1954's ""On the Waterfront"" is the union bosses, brilliantly portrayed by Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger and their thugs. They are allowed to do business because of the fright, intimidation, and passiveness of an entire group of longshoremen, who either work or don't while the big shots take kickbacks and steal from them. Then Joey Doyle, who had agreed to testify against the union bosses, is set up by a clueless Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) and thrown off of a roof. His sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint) is determined to find out what happened. But no one will talk. She shames Father Barry (Karl Malden) into taking more of an interest in what is happening on the docks, and he does. Still, no one's talking. Terry falls in love with Edie but still can't do the right thing. Another man is killed. When the killing finally affects Terry, he realizes something has to change.",v

The actors are superb in their roles, the dialogue is raw and powerful, the staging is tight and reflects the claustrophobic nature of the characters' lives in this part of Hoboken.

While I liked 'On the Waterfront' a lot the first time round, I appreciated it even more the second time.

Nor did it go on prime-time TV, as that concept came up many years later.  Instead, they put it on afternoon TV, sometimes around dinner time.

15,5 April 2006,Hitchcoc,10," Tough, Tough, Tough!","This is an actor's film. What an incredible cast, led by Marlon Brando. He has more range as an actor than virtually anyone I can imagine. His face is so expressive and his method acting pristine. He is such a complex character in this movie. How do you do the right thing. We are taught to hide feelings, not betray trusts (snitch), and yet how do we help the little guy, the downtrodden if we don't. It's a remarkable film about a man who has to do what he has to do and face beatings and exclusion and a reputation these dock workers would not want. He also has few prospects as the famous taxi scene shows us. It's too bad Brando had so many hang ups but maybe that's what made him great. There isn't an actor worth his salt that wouldn't want to have given one of those Brando performances, let alone the several glowing ones he did give. As he walks down the street, bloody, barely alive, we see a picture of determination like no other in film history. In his sorry state he is majestic and unbowed.",1

And Brando is indeed terrific as Terry Malloy, the non-intellectual brick-head and former boxer who is torn between his own conscience and loyalty to a corrupt gang of bullies. His scene in the taxi with Steiger is his most famous in the film. But I actually prefer his performance in the bar, wherein he tries to console the sister of the dead man.",9
17,30 April 2014,Theo Robertson,6, Hypocritical Meta-Fiction,"ON THE WATERFRONT is considered to one of the great classics of American cinema . It's easy to see why . It's a story that involves a nobody standing up to a powerful and corrupt organisation and doing the right thing , of one man making a difference . However it's impossible to watch this once you know the background of the director Elia Kazan . A Turkish immigrant to America he started off in theater and along with Lee Strasberg introduced something called "" Method acting "" where the actor gets in to the psychological depths and motivation of their character and effectively becomes that character . Where as previously film stars like Clark Gable , Errol Flynn etc etc were always playing a different shade of themselves a new breed of actors in the 1950s such as James Dean and Marlon Brando brought the method acting style to cinema and the method hit new heights in the late 1960s and 70s with New Hollywood . Perhaps we should be thankful for Kazan ? Maybe but the downside was Kazan was not a nice person at all from a very important moral viewpoint ",/

21,18 June 2021,nickenchuggets,10," ""I coulda been somebody""","I don't think I've reviewed any movies with Marlon Brando in them (aside from the adaptation of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar), so I need to fix that by talking about this movie. On the Waterfront has a reputation of being one of the best movies ever made, and definitely in the top 20 or so in the crime genre. No matter how you look at it, you can't deny its magnificence. Brando brings a strong feeling of toughness to a movie that is already full of merciless and ruthless men who intimidate each other into doing their dirty work. At the same time, Brando does not really see himself as a tough guy in this movie. Maybe that's what makes it surprising for many people. The movie focuses on how mob bosses control the docks that ships pull into and scare their subordinates into going along with it. Brando plays Terry Malloy, who works at one of these docks. A mob boss named Johnny Friendly is suspected to be involved in some murders, but he uses his control over the docks to silence any opposition. Terry's brother Charley is Johnny's lieutenant and most trusted ally. When the brother of a girl named Edie is killed, she tries to enlist the help of a priest played by Karl Malden to do something about the mob's actions. The mobsters break up a meeting being held by the priest, and shortly after, Edie starts to like Terry. This gets ruined later on when he tells her he is partially responsible for her brother's death. As the movie goes on, Friendly has Charley murdered in an attempt to scare Terry, but Terry is adamant about killing him. The priest tells Terry not to fight Friendly face to face in a dirty alleyway like a wild animal, because that's what he wants. Instead, he suggests testifying against him in court, which works out because it makes his role in the murders more well known. The mob cuts relations with Friendly, and just to be spiteful, Friendly tells Terry he'll never have a job on the docks ever again. This backfires though, since after Terry goes to the docks looking for work, they hire everybody but him. The other workers rebel and refuse to work unless he gets the job too. A fight breaks out between Terry and Friendly's henchman and they beat him relentlessly, but with his new friends behind him, Terry gets the job and Friendly is powerless to stop him. This is a very inspiring movie. It shows the inner workings of how the mafia used to (and sometimes still does) control docks on the east coast of the US, and how you have to do exactly as they say or else you'll be sorry. Brando fulfills his role as Terry perfectly, mainly because he is just a lowly bystander for most of the movie. He watches the mob do all these horrible crimes and get away with it, even once Edie gets the priest to interfere. He loses a lot of confidence in himself later on, but it's won back at the end when everyone sides with him against Friendly. Lee Cobb as Johnny Friendly is intimidating and distinctive. He's not the top mob boss, but he's up there, and his presence in the movie announces to his enemies that they better behave unless they're ready to fight dirty. Karl Malden as the priest Barry serves as a kind of father figure to Brando, and what he says usually has something to do with advice or guidance. Finally, Eva Saint plays Edie, who deserts Terry in the movie after learning of his role in her brother's demise, but comes back to him later on. Filmed in New Jersey, the movie has an industrial and sort of run down look to it, which sets the mood for the various murders that take place. Overall, this is one of the most exceptional crime movies ever made, and whether you like the genre or not, you should give it a look if you haven't yet.",f

23,15 November 2014,christophe92300,2, Doesn't live up to its reputation,"Sure the fight against mafia gangrene, corruption, the « one against all » sympbolic are appealing subjects but the treatment the story had is too timid. The dramatic progression is rather mediocre, the narration lacks grip, tension, it is too linear, too predictable and too slow to captivate the viewer's attention from end to end. The actors are bland, a vast majority of people by the way even consider Marlon Brando's performance as one of his best when his acting is just dreadfully inexpressive. As for the cinematography, which is also often highly regarded, it's more than OK but very academic, and often badly served by a deafening, too grandiloquent soundtrack. With 8 Oscars and a solid reputation, On The Waterfront appeared like a true masterpiece but ultimately the movie could very well be part of the overrated classics category.",=

26,1 November 2022,mmallon4,10, Snitches Get Stitches,"On The Waterfront is one of the most strikingly humble films to ever come out of Hollywood. Inspired by a series of articles on union violence and longshoremen corruption titled ""Crimes On The Waterfront"" by Malcolm Johnson, On The Waterfront doesn't get classified within the ranks as a gangster film or a film noir even though elements of both genres are present within it. The film has several noir trademarks including a mood of pessimism, fatalism, and menace however as common with the genre, there is no glamour within its cynicism - there is nothing glamorous in On The Waterfront. Set and filmed on location in Hoboken, New Jersey where men scrap by making a living, this neo-realist world of dock-side urbanity is absent of any Hollywood artifice. You can feel the chilly atmosphere from the cold breath coming from the actor's mouths to the smoke emanating from trash burnt by homeless on men the street.

The scene in the cab (and the still photo seems to have been taken not during film in but during one of Steiger and Brando's ""moments"" in-between takes, silly gooses) is the most noted and famous take, and of course it's a great scene, so great that when it's done you still can't believe it's 55 years old. But there's other really great scenes and moments: Karl Malden with his unique spud-nose going off on the waterfront workers after the man is killed from the crates falling; Brando picking up the glove and putting it on his hand or offering the gum and then chewing it himself in front of Saint; Lee J.

That film back then was ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and brought Karl Malden the win. Here he got another nomination. Lee J. Cobb shines as the main villain and manages his first Academy Award nomination just like Rod Steiger, who has only a very small part and was a complete newcomer to movies at that point. The latter could also be said about Eva Marie Saint with the difference that she did win the prestigious Supporting Actress award for her breakthrough movie.

38,30 January 2021,theognis-80821,3, Truth Matters,"Many talented people made this intellectually dishonest movie. Why is the ILWU under attack? The longshoreman had one of America's most courageous and honest unions. Their leader, Harry Bridges, was born in Australia and had been both a socialist and a communist. The government tried and failed to deport him. No wonder his union was under attack by Hollywood, as opposed to company unions or Mafia influenced unions. J. Edgar Hoover maintained that there was no Mafia, while they owned him: Communists, who were idealistic about unions, were his target. Even more ludicrous was the notion that the Catholic Church in New York in the 1950s, headed by Cardinal Spellman, was a force for progressive change. This movie presents a decadent and dishonest argument, so, despite the skillful craftsmanship, it is repellent. Elia Kazan often did excellent work, but Hollywood leftists held him in special contempt. I used to do transcripts for interviews by historians. The night before Kazan testified, he spent the evening with leftists, whose company he declared that he enjoyed above any other. The following day, he went in and named names. ""On the Waterfront"" stinks of this vivid cowardice. This movie's poison continues to infect our politics. Many Americans, bankrupted by business controlled government and paid with lines of credit instead of wages, believe that the unions, which created a middle class, are an enemy from which they need to be rescued: a movie made by SAG, DGA, WGA, IATSE union members.",

It's the best performance I've seen Marlon Brando give, to a role that probably suited him perfectly. He made the movie along with a good script.

This is one of the classics which I feel much honored to watch as this movie swiped 8 Oscars including best picture of 1954 and Brando got the golden trophy first time for best actor in leading role.

42,18 November 2010,eabakkum,5, A political film from the Cold War discrediting unionism,"Perhaps the most intriguing aspect about ""On the Waterfront""is that it is a highly political film. The personal drama of the main character (Brando as the docker Terry) and the love story are poor conveyances for the discrediting of unionism and the glorification of the catholic church during the zenith of the Cold War. In view of the controversial nature of the film the superabundant award of Oscars (eigth!) seems somewhat overdone. In fact the director Elia Kazan himself has gained a bad reputation of slandering and ruining some of his colleagues during the black McCarthy years. He branded the following actors as Communists: Clifford Odets, J. Edward Bromberg, Lewis Leverett, Morris Carnovsky, Phoebe Brand, Tony Kraber, Ted Wellman, and Paula Miller. Looking back on these years one can only wonder how the naive propaganda could develop such a deep influences on the public. Although in our present days similar films are still produced (see for instance ""Hoffa"" of director DeVito), the rise of independent film makers and the globalization of the film industry have luckily furthered a more balanced supply of cinematic narratives. Let us briefly summarize the fictional story: in the New York harbor, the local union of dock laborers is led by Johnny Friendly. Friendly makes shabby deals with the local businessmen, enriching himself and his close clique. Dockers, who try to criticize his methods, are expelled from the working force. Eventually the authorities form a political and judicial committee, that will investigate the ties between the union section and organized crime (just like in ""F.I.S.T.""and ""Hoffa""). The thugs and other associates of Friendly react with murder in order to silence the dockers, when they profess to testify before the committee. During the course of the film we gape at two of such liquidations. The father of the parish becomes the mouthpiece of the few remaining honest workers, in an attempt to restore decency and justice in the community (I guess in the present days Kazan would have selected another type of notable). He convinces the naive Terry, a dock laborer whose brother belongs to the Friendly clique, to inform the committee and take a stand against Friendly. Eventually Terry concedes, and supplies the incriminating evidence. At first the other dockers are dismayed at what they see as telltaling. In addition they realize that they have lost their union. Interestingly Kazan pays quite some attention to this common feeling of betrayal, which seems indeed incredible in view of the passed union atrocities. It may well be that here Kazan is working up his own conduct during the McCarthy years. Friendly senses his defeat, and orders his thugs to beat up Terry. In the end we see a severely injured Terry stumbling towards the harbor sheds, where he is welcomed by a dock baron (glad to be rid of the union riff-raff) and by his now sympathizing colleagues. Imho the acting and dramatization are not bad, although sometimes a bit out of proportion. Nevertheless the film lacks credibility. Of course it can not be denied that the barter culture of unions may lure individual officials into dubious transactions. However, in the setting of the New York harbor it is impossible to imagine the portrayed excesses. The observer gets the sensation of looking at a reverse Eisenstein picture. Perhaps what remains as value in ""On the Waterfront"" for our times is the exemplification of political Cold War propaganda during the fifties. If you are just interested in collective bargaining or even sympathize with unionism, there are definitely more informative and realistic accounts. Try Salt of the Earth (of the same period, but banned!), Norma Rae, Bread and Roses, Harlan County War, Matewan, Man of Iron. Or take a look at the other films about social action, that I have reviewed here on IMDb.",

When a woman's life is at risk that one of the brothers really likes, the union and one of the brothers are about to be at odds...the brother may be at odds also. This movie is directed by Elia Kazan (A Streetcar Named Desire) and stars Marlon Brando (A Streetcar Named Desire), Lee J. Cobb (The Exorcist), Eva Marie Saint (North by Northwest), Rod Steiger (In the Heat of the Night) and Leif Erickson (The Carpet Baggers). The storyline for this picture is outstanding and has so many dimensions. It shows how the lowly need to scrape to get by, the powers and corruptions of early unions, family dynamics and how that impacts relationships...and there's a love story in here too. The dialogue and character interactions are so good and executed to perfection by the marvelous cast. Brando and Cobb are magnificent. There is so many perfectly executed sequences, and none better than when the two brothers face off on why there is animosity between them. The music is used wisely to create subtle intensities within the scenes. I absolutely adored the concluding scene and how one versus many turns into many versus many to transform the direction of the group and unions. Overall this is one of the greatest American films ever made and one I'd strongly recommend. I would score this a 10/10.",

The legendary Brando gives a fine performance as a conflicted and guilt ridden torched soul by the name of Terry Malloy. Malloy who's an ex-fighter remembers(I ""could have been a contender"" which is the films most famous and quoted line) anyway he now works for mob union boss Johhny Friendly(Lee J.

All along the way though the viewer can see the guilt and remorse problems of the central character as with each passing scene you want to tell Terry to stand up and face the truth and leave the corrupt world of blood money and favors. The film has a special love theme brought about when Terry falls for a young blond and becomes the lover of Edie Doyle(Eva Marie Saint) it is by the inspiration and warmth of her that Terry is pushed to see the new light and it's even more obvious when Terry's brother(Rod Steiger) is killed. Then the search for the truth and integrity is a must as a conflicted man must face the underworld head on to achieve real peace and comfort within, and most of all his conscious is set free. Really the final scenes are unforgettable with high drama and courage. Great performances are given also from Karl Malden as a concerned and fiery town priest, and Lee J.

First and foremost, fifty years later, this film is still an absolute stunner. Kazan, with screenwriter Budd Schulberg, has fashioned a pulsating story about Mob informers amid the highly corrupted longshoreman unions on the New Jersey docks in the fifties. The focus is on the evolution of Terry Malloy, a former boxer who has been relegated to play errand boy for a nasty union boss, the ironically named Johnny Friendly. Terry's brother Charley, a crooked union lawyer, is the one who got him to give up boxing and take the menial job. Terry is satisfied with his status until a neighborhood pal gets thrown off a roof to prevent him from testifying to the crime commission. Terry is then driven headlong to his conscience by local priest Father Barry and Edie Doyle, the potential informer's sister.

93,6 November 2020,jayjaycee,10, About pigeons and hawks,"""On The Waterfront"" is a 1954 crime drama directed by Elia Kazan starring Marlon Brando and Karl Malden.
⚪
All in all, this Elia Kazan essential film packingly explores the organised crime and dangerous mob criminality on the waterfront by reference to the conflict of a man torn between love and loyalty, masterfully portrayed by Marlon Brando, and thanks to a perfectly balanced pacing, intense and insightful writing and an outstandingly performing cast, it becomes a crime drama per excellence that displays masterclass storytelling at its finest and knows to grab you in a way you will not see coming at all.
⚪
A few months ago, I was introduced to the works of both Elia Kazan and Marlon Brando when I watched their first collaboration, the marvellous adaptation of Tennessee Williams' outstanding play ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", and after that, I was so tremendously excited to check out more of them. By a fortunate coincidence, I stumbled across this classic here when I rummaged the bargain table at my local store, and for only five bucks, I had to get it. As it turns out, it was one of the best decisions I have made this year, as this film blew me away more than I expected. I thought that their first cooperation was impeccable, but this one beats the hell out of it. Brando plays the longshoreman Terry Malloy, an ex-prize fighter who works for the local mob boss Johnny Friendly, who happens to control every pier and every dock in the area. What amazes me the most about this film is how it manages to do the splits between being a sensitive character study and being an intense crime flick with some subtle film noir vibes, because next to Terry's inner conflict, it gives an insight into how organised crime works. Malloy, superbly portrayed by Brando, is an incredibly elaborated and eclectic character, because even if he is the henchman of the local mob boss and acts all tough all the time, there is still this turmoil and the myriad of emotions resulting from this buried deep inside of him. On multiple occasions, he complains about how he could have been a legendary fighter if he had followed his dreams instead of hanging around with the mafia. He has been entangled in this construction most of his life, so what is it that makes him reconsider his whole life? The simplest answer: love. After his latest job, he gets to know the sister of the poor fellow he and his colleagues silenced after he spoke up. The thing is, he is somewhat sensitive and couldn't deal with the fact that the man has been killed even if it wasn't necessary, but at the same time loyalty kept him from speaking up to his benefactor and boss, Johnny Friendly, threateningly played by Lee. J. Cobb. To me, it feels like he at first just gets involved with the dead fellow's sister Edie simply because he tries to appease his remorse, but the more the film moves on, the more his affection towards her becomes genuine. Seriously, the chemistry between Brando and Eva Marie Saint (who delivered impressively in her feature film debut) increases gradually, and while it looks like the romance is artificial in the beginning, it is authentic as hell in the very end. Romance brings out the version in him he always wanted to be, but this change of heart entails a severe conflict that defines this film: Who does he swear fidelity to? The crooked man he has worked for most of his life and who enabled him to have constant work or the girl that he fell in love with and deserves justice for what she has been through? It is up to him to decide whether he wants to change the world or let it stay the same, and Brando conveys this inner disunity exceptionally. I as the viewer asked myself ""What would I do if I was him?"" and wasn't able to come to a conclusion. This film affected me in a way I wasn't expecting. On one hand, you don't bite the hand that feeds you, on the other hand, you have to be true to yourself. The tension builds up accordingly to how this conflict becomes more severe, and while I was interested but somewhat neutral in the beginning, I was gradually more packed by this film. Seriously, it has been a while since I was thus intrigued by a film and felt it so intensely. And in the last third, the entire conflict gets out of hand completely. After the mafia, threatened by their former ally, kill Terry's brother, he wants to get his retribution and ultimately decides to testify in court. As a result, he has done the right thing and avenged his brother, but at the same time, the union and most of his friends disgraced him for ratting on the boss. And this is where my favourite part of the entire film begins: in the last twenty minutes or such, all feelings erupt, resulting in one of the most powerful displays of acting and climatic writing I have ever seen. Regardless of his status, Terry goes to the docks and faces off with Johnny Friendly, they even engage in hand combat, before the mobster comments his henchmen to step in. All union workers watch this unfair fight from afar, but you can see in their faces that they are about to change their minds forever. They don't in fact join the brawl but refuse to work for Friendly (who than goes diving involuntarily) and instead state that they only continue to work if Terry leads them. The scene when Terry gets up, completely smashed up and barely on his feet, and spearheads his colleagues, who follow him without reservations, gave me severe goosebumps. You don't destroy a mob boss by beating him up, you defeat him by no longer obeying him, and this is exactly what happens in this magnificent final scene. No mindless free-for-all but masterful warfare. And that impressed me tremendously. To be honest, I wasn't expecting this film to be this great, because it has happened in the past that older Academy Award winning films aged terribly, but in this case is not the case at. The acting, the writing, every single line of dialogue, the setting - it is all brilliant. Before he was Don Corleone, Marlon Brando wrote cinematic history by crushing the mafia on the waterfront, and honestly, as of now, I think this is the best film from the fifties I have ever seen. It truly is a showpiece of dramatic writing.",

He was under the impression that he was only suppose to distract the victim for a rough encounter but instead he witnesses worse. Work conditions are bad with the Waterfront dictating. Eva Marie Saint demands the identity of her brother's killer. The local priest challenges even further when violence breaks out. The result is a film that is both thought provoking and convicting with strong plotting. Directed by Eliza Kazan with much made regarding his Communist involvement. The film plays like an apology or reasoning. He previously worked with Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire. Here he turns it up a notch further. Brando delivers a powerful performance as a man caught between betrayal and confession for the sacrifice of love. Rod Steiger plays his brother placed in a fatal position. Saint is effective as a woman seeking the truth and as a result influences Brando's conscience. Lee J. Cobb plays the ruthless villain who makes the rules until challenged by Brando. Karl Malden brings a moral centre to the film as a priest moved towards the action that many are reluctant to take. Provocative and powerful filmmaking masterpiece. Score: 10 / 10",

Needless to say, it certainly lives up to its reputation as a timeless classic and one with an obvious political agenda, back in the HUAC days.

103,21 December 2010,mjneu59,10, still a contender,"One mark of a true classic is how much it improves over the years, and by that standard this hard-hitting drama certainly qualifies. The key to its longevity would have to be the combination of a memorable story with sympathetic characters, led by Marlon Brando's Terry Malloy, a dumb but sensitive ex-boxer who (reluctantly) stands up against the corrupt Union brotherhood controlling the New York City docks. The pivotal scene is still the midnight taxi ride, when Malloy confronts the betrayal of his brother Charley (Rod Steiger) in what was destined to become a golden moment in film history. From the way the exchange was framed and shot (with the camera held steady before the two actors for the duration of the scene) it's clear director Elia Kazan knew exactly what impact the scene would have. Screenwriter Bud Schulberg's message sometimes comes across too strong (angry preacher Karl Malden's sermon in the hold is hard to swallow), and by the end of the film Malloy is elevated almost to divinity, rising from a near-fatal beating to lead his fellow dockworkers to glory. But the film passes the test of time to show how an entertaining melodrama doesn't need to insult the viewer's intelligence.",

Like many great movies, it was a surprise success, there was also a great deal of controversy. Since it depicted the union of stevedores as being controlled by a ruthless organized crime syndicate, there were many voices of protest from the actual leaders of unions.
Marlon Brando plays Terry Malloy, a former prizefighter that now works unloading cargo ships. The local mob completely controls the union and they will tolerate no dissent, they decide if a man works or not. When Malloy's friend is killed and he starts becoming involved with the friend's sister, Malloy must decide whether to continue to go along with mob rule or to become a government witness.
It is my personal opinion that the best performance is by Karl Malden as the local priest that stands behind the men that want to get the crooks out of the union. His passion and principles provide a role model for the others to do the right thing. This movie provides one of the all-time best lines, ""I coulda been a contender.""

121,1 December 2011,writers_reign,6, Canal No 5,"It is virtually impossible to view this as just another film because as everyone and his Uncle Max is aware by now this is film being used as a tool by a man attempting to defend the indefensible. To recap briefly; the film's director, Elia Kazan, was what was known as a 'friendly' witness at the HUAC Hearings or, to put it in plain English, he 'named names' on the stand, testifying on oath that several colleagues and friends had been or possibly still were, members of the Communist party. In a different climate that would not have been viewed as a heinous offense but in the hysteria of the Cold War Communists were portrayed as three-headed monsters. By naming them Kazan more or less condemned them to a 'Blacklist' and rendered them unemployable. In On The Waterfront the character Terry Malloy is a symbol for Kazan himself but in this case when he (Malloy) 'names names' to a similar committee as HUAC he is portrayed as a hero rather than a traitor, ie. Kazan is attempting to justify betrayal. Now, if we can somehow get round this and watch the film as just that, we have a very fine film with some excellent performances especially from the four leads, Brando, Malden, Steiger and newcomer Eva Marie Saint.

But the plot of the film is both true to the core and false to the bone. We are in New York, on the harbor, on the side of the dockworkers and the very strange atmosphere that existed in not so long ago a time and that may still exist in some harbors in Europe and the USA. To get a job, a daily job quite too often, short time anyway, you had to come in the morning to be selected in order to answer the numbers required by the bosses, in that case the authority of the harbor. These names were selected and called by the union itself. Such a power and the very comfortable income you can get out of it is of course captivated by some union leaders who look more like gang leaders than union leaders. And they accepted no dissent in the rank and file. Killing was even a game that brought some entertainment to those bored Mafiosi. Till one murder too many was done and performed on someone who had the heart of the dockworkers and a daughter who wanted him to be eulogized. That was enough to trigger an explosive situation, in which the local catholic priest is playing the ""good devil"" for these gangsters and the ""guardian angel"" for the dockworkers. Apart from that the film is rather trite. The end though is a marvelous piece of work. The defeated union leaders are rejected by a unanimous vote of all dockworkers in support of Terry Malloy who was the stake of the fight and thus vote with their feet against the already forgotten union leaders. But one detail may not be as visible as it should be. The dockworkers are able to walk to the ships when, and only when, the representative of the harbor authorities let them go through. In other words the gangsterized union leaders are only defeated because the harbor authorities say so. It is not class struggle but it is gang war and company within the union with the support that can change from one moment to the next from the bosses in the harbor. Do not think these practices are finished. Far from it. They are an everyday reality in some professions where the unions, or rather some groups of unionized people, have taken the control of the workforce. It is true in harbors, but also in airports and in train-transport companies, at least in Europe. And even if that is waning away little by little.",

The movie has everything: a great story; a great script; great cinematography; great direction; and least but not least, great acting, especially that of Marlon Brando and Eva Marie Saint, who is absolutely hot. The chemistry between Brando and Eva Marie as almost palpable. They generate so much heat that at times you think the movie will melt. And they do this through the sheer force and power of their acting. Oh my, what great, great acting. The movie catches the gritty and tenuous nature of life and presents in no uncertain terms a story in which people have to make moral choices. Karl Malden is absolutely incredible as the heroic priest through which the moral conflict finds expression. Far from being corny or hokey or stagy or dated, the movie as a timeless quality which makes it a classic. Marlon Brando's performance is astonishing. His scene with Rod Steiger unsurpassed, and his fight with Lee J. Cobb, a work of art. If you like movies with great acting, dialog and story, then this movie is for you.",

It was mainly Jewish film industry people who suffered in those trials. It is based on a true story about Union Corruption on the waterfront and a rebellion by the longshoreman against it. Interestingly enough this waterfront scenario was the birth place of the Mafia who controlled it during the second world war. The USA Navy Intelligence sought co-operation from the waterfront mafia on Nazi espionage and infiltration in exchange for immunity from their criminal activities. The head of the FBI J.

I guess people in the 1950's would view this movie different than I have because that is the type of movies that they watched back then and in today's world it's different.

Terry stands up to the mob after he tells the truth about Joey's death. HE goes down to face them. Gets beat up but has everyone standing behind him and then goes to work. The camera angles are done very well. Like when they look at the window you feel like your there. The scenes are mostly dark and every so often the music will get loud.

The movie stars Marlon Brando as Terry Malloy an ex-prize fighter turned longshoreman for a corrupt union boss named Johnny Friendly (played by Lee J. Cobb) but while Malloy fails to stand up to him and his other friends for poor treatment of the workers.Kazan uses a great cast (besides Brando and Cobb) it also includes Karl Malden as the neighborhood priest, Eva Marie Saint (in a magnificent film debut), and Rod Steiger as Terry's brother Charlie Malloy. My favorite scene in this movie is when Terry and Charlie are in a car going somewhere and Terry says these memorable lines ""You don't understand I coulda had class,I coulda been a contender, I coulda been somebody instead of a bum, which is what I am.""

It is made with incredible sharpness and technique that no other film has topped since it was made. Marlon Brando gives a pitch-perfect performance, Eva Marie Saint is wonderful, Karl Malden is brilliant as the Priest, Lee J. Cobbs is absolutely frightening as the Mob Boss, and Rod Steiger is amazing as Brando's brother. Brando plays a character torn by morality and whether or not to rat out his brother as well as his boss in a murder of Joey Davis. Obviously, his brother and the Mob attempt to convince him to not rat them out but since he becomes romantically entangled with Joey's sister, he is torn now between what is right and wrong. Brando plays his character with such depth and intellectuality that no other actor could play him better. That is what makes On the Waterfront quite simply a divine film on all levels and truly deserved all 8 of the Oscars that it received for its production. Elia Kazan has etched his name among such great directors as John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick with this film that is the second best Mob film ever made, second only to The Godfather.

I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it. It was you, Charley. ¨ If you aren't moved by this quote then perhaps it's because you haven't seen 1954's On the Waterfront. I know the phrase isn't all that memorable if you read it on its own, but if you have seen this scene before then you probably get goose bumps just from reading it. Marlon Brando delivers this line to perfection in one of his best performances in a 5 minute scene with Rod Steiger in the back of a cab. It is considered by many as one of the best American scenes in film and in my opinion it is one of my favorites. I didn't care that the taxi had Venetian blinds in the back window or that the set wasn't great, all I really cared about were the two characters and the way they delivered each line. It is not only one of the most touching and memorable scenes of the movie, it stands on its own. If the film sucked for 100 minutes but still had this great cab scene in it I'd give this movie 10 stars anyways because it's just worth it. However the other 95 minutes don't suck, they are great as well so On the Waterfront ranks among the best films in history. Elia Kazan did a terrific job with the direction getting the best out of every actor on the set, the black and white cinematography by Boris Kaufman gave the film the realistic mood it needed, the screenplay written by Budd Schulberg and adapted from Johnson's news articles about the mobs that ruled the docks was inspiring, and the original music by Leonard Bernstein made this a perfect film. The film has aged very well even now 55 years later, and one can still appreciate the eight Oscars it won. The film truly captures the essence of the fifties and the social injustice that was going on in the waterfront.",

There is much atmosphere with some great dock scenes but essentially it is Brando both as tough guy younger brother to Rod Steiger and young lover to Eva Marie Saint.

They told a powerful story about the low levels humanity shrinks to and the secret codes of gang mentality inc. families! All of heterosexual life is rife with conformity and gang pathology. The base behavior of men is portrayed with gutsy material that shows how human beings are raised to run in packs and those who refuse are punished or killed. Every individual is a patsy and likes it. Those who try to break out are freaks and banished from the company of friends. If you feel disheartened and lost at the end of this film, it is because this truth about humanity rings through the ages and never will change because mankind is rotten through and through. I'm just amazed this film was made. In some ways it is a parable about Hollywood itself. Personally, I'm looking forward to the extinction of life by global warming. It is a fairy tale as well because we all know that the goodness of one man makes NO DIFFERENCE! Nobody who stood up to bullies ever really won in real life. Lawyers and government have seen to the final destruction of the rights of any individual. Marlon Brando's character absolutely COULD NOT EXIST in this day and age or even at the time of this movie but it was a brave attempt at trying to keep the fairy tale going.

168,5 May 2002,wa23gs,9, Plenty of cheers and jeers for On the Waterfront,"Every movie has the basis of a story between good and evil, and On the Waterfront is not different.  On the Waterfront however makes this competition quite interesting posing the decision between friends and good morals.  Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) witnesses a murder and has to decide between betraying his friends or doing what's right and getting the girl, Edi Doyle (Eva Marie Scott), he loves. 	 This movie has the perfect plot line for a movie, but unfortunately with this comes much ungrateful unfitting music, forced acting and scenes that seem to be shot by a three year old having a hissyfit.  In many parts of the film the music seems like it is going to lead up to something big and then the scene ends leaving the viewer in utter disbelief that pinnacled music was brought up to a point of nothing.  When the viewer would see something important happening it wasn't accented at all by the music but followed by awkward silence.  The music throughout the whole film is not only unfitting but also very cheesy. 	Terry Malloy's love, Edie Doyle, should have received an award for most likely to not impress a stoner at his peak of intelligence instead of Best Supporting Actress.  Every scene that she was in, she forced out her words and feelings like she was being controlled by a very bad ventriloquist. Some film critics have said that they have cried from her touching performance, I think I cried after laughing so much at her awful acting. Edie wasn't the only actor whose skills seemed rather forced, Father Barry (Karl Malden), also had his moments to have his strings pulled.  Most of his speeches, like the rousing speech at the packing plant, were very well done; but sometimes Father Barry would act more like monkey on a leash rather than a priest. 	With so much jeer for the film there is probably a greater amount of cheer. Marlon Brando does a very good job of playing a former prize fighting Terry Malloy who tries to fight the mob and be himself.  Marlon Brando took the part of Terry Malloy and molded it into the perfect part to make this film a little less than wonderful.  The other great points of the movie were the scenes of the mob.  Head mobster Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) does a very good job of intimidating others and showing that he deserves to be the head honcho. 	On a ten point scale I give this movie an 8.  I loved the ultimate decision between friends and evil, which many of us come across everyday of our lives.  Marlon Brando makes a land shattering performance and the mob scenes are very well done.  The music and forced acting of Eva Marie Scott and Karl Malden brought this movie down significantly.",

Both the director and writer testified against various Hollywood people to McCarthy and/or the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. Both were disillusioned former members of the communist party of USA and as such it is really impossible to miss the allegory in Terry's story and alleged heroism. This isn't even about any moral qualms about what they did (through yes awful actions on their part) one might have, it just makes the film uncomfortable to watch as it sure feels like they both are trying to appease their conscience in a hamfisted way.

The film was also rated number 8 on AFI's top 100 list of the twentieth century.  ",
182,18 May 2008,dead47548,10, More than deserves it's place as one of the greatest of all time.,"An incredibly powerful film about a man rising up against corruption. Marlon Brando gives a tour de force performance as Terry Malloy, a former boxer turned street thug for corrupt union boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb). The film opens up with Terry baiting his friend into getting murdered, and this is when he begins to realize that he's doing something he doesn't believe is right. Throughout the story, we see Terry's internal struggle between the way things work and the way things truly should be and Brando fleshes out this internal anguish flawlessly. In the few scenes where he truly lets his emotions go, my heart breaks. Standing on the side of the just is Father Barry (Karl Malden, in another impeccable performance), the local priest who encourages longshoremen to stand up against Friendly. Though the true reason for Terry's uprising is in the heart of Edie Doyle (Eva Marie Saint in an Oscar-winning debut performance), the sister of the man Terry set up at the beginning of the film. The two of them sizzle on screen together as their adorable, intense romance blooms despite the chaos surrounding them. It's one of the best-acted films I've ever seen with every single actor giving a stunning performance. The work from Brando, Malden and Saint all ranks among the greatest in cinematic history.",

Well there may be a little perfect in it, but I won't go overboard. Marlon Brando and Eva Marie Saint's acting is particularly good. The long scenes we have between them seem like two humans conversing, not actors talking. Their chemistry is actually realistic unlike their other romances as seen in Streetcar Named Desire(1951) or North By Northwest(1959). Instead this seems to be a lot more like Marty(1955) which is really just two awkward people having an awkward relationship that is inherently realistic. The black and white cinematography casts the poverty ridden waterfront in a documentary like style similar to that of Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (1948). Leonard Bernstein was kicking it into high gear when he decide to temporarily step down from orchestrating for symphonies and score On the Waterfront. Specifically his them titled 'Walk and End Title' is particularly beautiful. Combined with the brilliance of Elia Kazan's directing and you have one of the single greatest films ever made.",

Given how powerfully it affected me in 2020, I can only imagine the impact it had on viewers in 1954! There are many things to appreciate about this film. For instance, Marlon Brando puts on a clinic in method acting. His Terry Malloy is utterly fleshed out in every mannerism and utterance. Also, the many intimate scenes, rendered in gorgeous chiaroscuro lighting, between characters bursting under the weight of buried pain and frustration, are all examples of great cinematic storytelling.
But THE ONE THING that replays in my mind, after this viewing, is the use of the passion of Christ as the narrative device to bring this story of redemption to its climax. It's especially striking because in all other respects, the story is very contemporary. It tells the tale of our hapless hero's participation in the mob's infiltration of the waterfront longshoreman's union. Then, Terry gradually comes to face to face with his conscience and bears witness against the thugs. Through his subsequent physical suffering, he is ennobled to the status of messiah, cleansing the waterfront of sin, and restoring honesty and integrity to the workplace.

Brandos performance is great, he was known to be an inspiration to that of Elvis Presley and James Dean, two of the most historical icons of the twenty first century. Besides Brandos talent, the plot is one that is easy to follow, it grips you and pulls you into the story and really gives a ton of insight into the mind frame of Brandos character. The editing was especially great. There were a lot of scenes that show and focus on what Brando would be actually looking at, which also lets the audience in one what the main character is feeling and going through during the movie. The film is filmed on location in Hoboken, NJ which i thought gave the movie a truer sense of feeling. The sights of the streets and docks and the working class hero's all tie into making the film believable, and more impacting on the viewers experience. All in all i really loved this one and would strongly recommend it to just about anyone, there is an important social message that lies in the fiber of this film, one that involves a personal struggle with ones conscious that can be applied to a wide range of personal dilemmas.",

However, the fact remains that the film revolutionized cinema for the years to come. On the waterfront is a somewhat grandiose gangster film with splashes of realism. This element can further be observed in Brando's character Terry. He seems like a typical tough guy with any hint of innocence drained out of him, but in his eyes can you see remorse, pain and melancholy. This can particularly be seen in a scene when he is in a taxi with his brother. That is the magic of Marlon Brando, I suppose, the ability to speak even without bothering a muscle or nerve.",

207,11 June 2009,charlytully,10," ""Do it to him before he does it to you""--Terry Malloy","The big picture concerning ON THE WATERFRONT is that it's NOT an anti-union vehicle, though its main element is the fight against union corruption foisted upon east coast longshoremen by self-embedded mafiosos. On a more nitty-gritty level, WATERFRONT encompasses gripping drama, unconditional love, and a conversion of protagonist Terry Malloy from his original credo of ""do it to him before he does it to you"" to something approximating the Golden Rule (""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you""). Filmed amid unrelenting cold--you can see the actors' breath in most of the outdoor takes--namers-of-names before the HUAC witch hunt of the early 1950s (director Elia Kazan and writer Budd Schulberg) were brought together on-set with those who refused to cave in to the fascism then in fashion (such as Marlon Brando, who played Terry Malloy). It is fascinating to ponder how those whose ethnicity would have gotten them killed in Europe a few years earlier became so easily cowed in real life, yet so apt at proffering the power of an individual to stand in the face of mob rule on the movie screen. The climactic close of WATERFRONT is just as outlandishly capraesque as anything Frank Capra ever directed. I honestly feel IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a much grimmer picture than WATERFRONT, since Terry seems to have a brighter future when the curtain rings down than Jimmy Stewart's George Bailey does at the close of the former feature.",

Many period pieces have been made ""after the fact"", that require the audience to trust that the research has been done and that what they are watching is a plausible representation of that era. It takes a special kind of film to effortlessly appear legitimate to any generation that would be exposed to it, and any kind of social or political commentary it was trying to make can be easily swallowed. I insist that On The Waterfront exemplifies that analogy.",

Everything in this film is perfection - Kazan's direction,Schulberg's screenplay, Kaufman's cinematography and the amazing acting from Brando, Malden, Saint (in her film debut), Steiger and Cobb. Every single part in this film is well cast and acted - down to the smallest bit role, which adds to the incredible realism of the story. Many actors, such as Martin Balsam, Fred Gwynn and Pat Hingle, were just starting out and they all contribute to this masterpiece. Leonard Bernstein's score is another plus and underscores the drama wonderfully. Many scenes stand out, including the one between Steiger and Brando in the back of the cab, Malden's incredible speech in the hold of the ship and Brando's amazing refusal to succumb to evil and brutality at the film's climax. The movie won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and deserved every one of them. 62 years after it was made, this film is still as powerful and as moving as the day it was released.

It was with this that I approached ""On the Waterfront"" with some trepidation - and my fears proved groundless. ""On the Waterfront"" won 8 Oscars and, having seen it, it's no great surprise. Marlon Brando won Best Actor for his role as Terry Malloy, a dockman who is warring with his guilt over the role he played in the death of a dockman who failed to agree with the policies of local crime lord Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb). Brando is being pressed upon by Father Barry (Karl Malden) to testify in court against Johnny and he has to decide how much his soul matters to him. Brando is nothing short of superb - Malloy could have been played as a one-dimensional fellow but instead I was treated to one of the most lifelike characters I've witnessed in the movies. We see him express humility, hope, anger and a variety of other emotions and yet never are they *overly* expressed, never done in an exaggerated manner. They're entirely like-like and it is now that I can see why Brando is held in such esteem. However it's not just Brando - Malden and Cobb and Malloy's love interest played by Eva Marie Sant are all wonderful which is no doubt why there was Oscar nominations for Malden and Sant. ",

Excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, settings, score and acting. All the actors involved deliver superlative performances. Brando commands the screen and offers the best performance in his young career. The plot revolves around a dockworker named Terry who threw away a boxing career by throwing a fight for the mob. The mob boss has a longshoreman murdered which forces Terry to team up with the victim's sister and a streetwise priest to testify against the mob boss and his control of the Hoboken waterfront. Terry does this after being strongly advised not to by his brother who is the mob boss' lawyer. The plot is intense, gritty, raw, ingenious, sublime, realistic, gripping, timeless and has a cathartic ending. To this day you'll hear fans of the movie quote such lines as, "" If I spill, my life ain't worth a nickel"". This is a memorable work of art and is one of the very best ever in it's genre.",
248,12 September 2019,jsommers-893-70788,8, Terrific movie but...,"...It's a movie of its time, and it requires that allowances be made for that. Most noticeable is the intrusive sound track by Leonard Bernstein, clearly a warm up for West Side Story, which would play on Broadway three years later. Today's films don't use music as Kazan used it, in an attempt to force emotional reactions; the music is beautiful but overwrought. That's ironic because much of the film is about ""small"" emotions as Terry wrestles with his conscience. I'd love to see the movie again with no background music at all. Brando is memorable in a performance that has influenced film acting ever since, but great film acting now is more minimalist and subtle than Brando's performance, which is compelling but full of tics and winks. His eyes are immensely powerful, yet his face is rarely still. Lee J Cobb rivals him in his powerful, but exaggerated performance as the film's heavy. I was most moved by Karl Malden as the priest and Rod Steiger in a heart-wrenching performance as Terry's older brother. Still a great movie, but one which requires a viewer's patience for a film from a different era..",
249,15 February 2013,kurosawakira,7, Then There's Brando,"Generally speaking I have to admit this isn't my cup of tea. But there are two aspects that I really enjoy about Elia Kazan's vision of the waterfront. The first is Boris Kaufman, the cinematographer of all four films by Jean Vigo, as well as of Lumet's masterpiece ""12 Angry Men"" (1958). Especially the crowd scenes at the waterfront and the wedding scene at the pub are brilliantly conceived pieces of movement, and the way he shoots interiors somewhat anticipates the tensity of the Lumet.",

251,26 September 2009,steven_torrey,8, Terry Malloy--Brando--witnesses a murder and must tell the feds...,There is moral obligation to tell the district attorney what you know about a murder. Elia Kazan did not have moral obligation to name names of members of the communist party from Hollywood. The movie then becomes self-serving--but worse. Kazan ends up doing something profoundly unethical and questionable in equating his naming names and Terry's witness of a murder. That just doesn't compute. And the attempt at equation is questionable behavior from Kazan.,
252,1 December 2010,n-racicot,8, On the Waterfront,"On the Waterfront was directed by Elia Kazan in 1954. The film (based partially on fact) exposed truths or taboos that had been covered for years. Its focus was on organized crime in New York City, but could have been a symbol for all organized crime. Marlon Brando played the roll of Terry Malloy, a young man trying to make something of himself the wrong ways. Malloy finally ""mans up"" by taking the responsibilities of righting the wrongs that have been done and in the end comes out a working class hero. Almost all aspects of the movie are ""realistic"". Examples are the characters written as ""regular"" people and the majority of the movie being shot on location in Hoboken NJ. Its not surprising this film received eight academy awards! I would recommend this to anyone interested in a great dramatic movie.",

After Terry has done the right thing , and risked everything to set things right and try to disenpower the union bosses, he ends up in a fight with Mr. Friendly. He gets beaten up pretty bad.

Obviously, Brando's character is very much like Rocky and the two films are very much related. And Brando's performance is just as endearing as Stallone's. Brando is fantastic. The scene with him and Eva Marie Saint, where they're walking through the park and- comedian Richard Lewis mentioned this when he was on Turner Classic Movies with Robert Osborne- and Brando seemingly semi-consciously puts on one of her gloves. It's one of his subtle performance gestures in the movie that really struck me. Great movie.",
256,15 December 2010,d-jacobs1,8, A true contender.,"Brando shines in this rebellious and moving picture. His role as a lackey for the corrupt mobsters who run the shipyard is played to near perfection. Full of regret, angst, love, and loss, Brando brings his character to iconic status. The film makes use of the waterfront location very well, incorporating vast rooftop shots, dark alleys, and crowded bars. Terry's pursuit of Edie leads him down a righteous path, and he sees, with new eyes, the wrong which is being done. I felt Terry's obsession with his pigeons was somewhat symbolic of the way Terry himself felt; contained and only let free to return again shortly. His birds being killed, followed by his brother, brought about his climactic and exciting rebellion against the dock mob. After He is beaten up, he stumbles to the dock, leading the inspired workers. While he does this the camera cuts to creative POV shots which wobble and blur, emphasizing his battered condition which was an interesting touch to a film filled with great moments.",
257,13 November 2010,JoshuaC96,10, On the Waterfront,"On the waterfront was really great. Marlon Brando was absolutely perfect for his part. Terry Malloy is a sort of defeated man who finds a reason to fight again, and Brando's portrayal of the character was fantastic. My favorite scene is towards the end when Terry is talking to his brother in the back seat of the car. A lot of Terry's true thoughts and feelings about his life and details about his past are revealed in the scene. You learn about the situation with his brother and how he was forced to throw the fight that would have given him a shot at the title. It is an extremely gripping scene and it adds an extra layer of importance to everything that takes place later at the docks. In my opinion there is a kind of dual message in On the Waterfront. One side of the coin deals with Terry and his personal struggles, which has a great message about self-worth and perseverance. On the other hand you have the film's larger message about tyranny and oppression by those in power, which concerns all of the characters in the movie. The two messages kind of culminate together at the end when terry goes to the docks to confront Johnny. During the scene Terry is finally able overcome his issues while at the same time put down the oppressors, which in my opinion helps to give him a sense of importance and value. He becomes more than just some bum in the eyes of the people around him and he earns their respect. The movie is extremely impacting and I think it's one of the best we've seen in class.",
258,7 December 2010,alexv1208,8, Review of On the Waterfront,"Overall, a great film, definitely one that was worth watching. On the Waterfront is in simple terms, a classic. It's an action packed gangster film with lots of controversy packed into the plot. There's a sort of authentic feel to the film, and the fact that it was shot on scene really adds to the mise-en scene. However, since the film was done a low budget, and it contains a lot of political and criminal context, this says something negative about society. The film was so realistic and raw. The viewer gets a true sense of what life was like, not just because it was shot on scene but also because the actors played their part so beautifully. The whole natural feel of the wonderfully done black and white film, is something that is incomparable to many other films of its time.",
259,10 December 2012,daviddaphneredding,8, Brando did become a contender,"""I coulda been a contender."" Who doesn't remember this line? In this outstanding Elia Kazan-directed work, Marlon Brando was very adept in acting the part of Terry Malloy, a deposed boxer who had nothing to live for and cared about no one at all, not even himself. He was referred to as a ""bum"", and so he was on the rough New York waterfront run by the union thugs. All he wanted to do was go to work, and sometimes he was even refused that. It was wonderful to see him positively influenced by Edie Doyle; Eva Marie Saint portrayed this part very well, especially in light of the fact that this was her first role. Rod Steiger, noted for playing thugs (or ""apes"")was as mean and as boisterous as ever as Malloy's crooked brother Charley the Gent. Karl Malden did not, I feel, receive enough acclaim as the completely brave priest who would not let anything, not even trash and bottles thrown on him, stop him from frankly telling the ""straight"" workers to stand up and fight. The burly Lee J. Cobb was nothing but mean and loud as the union boss Johnny Friendly. The acting was outstanding. Though the scenery was not at all pretty,...though, in turn, the situation on the waterfront was itself very ugly...the movie was realistic in manifesting the brutality found among the thugs. Yes, toward the end of the movie Brando proved that he was still a contender. The ugly waterfront situation and the character study..;.and the story was centered around both...rendered it a par excellence movie. No wonder this Columbia Pictures movie won the Academy Award for Best Picture for 1954.",

Seeing it in black and white never confounded me however in understanding the story of the film, which is the important one. This film made me understand how Marlon Brando is often cast as a misunderstood character. Starting bad and ending up good. Karl Malden was also a striking actor! So as well with Eva Marie Saint, whom others played well their characters. My father mentioned to me how good ""Waterloo"" was, a film about Napoleon Bonaparte's defeat which starred Rod Steiger—and yes Rod Steiger! I didn't even notice him playing as Charley! Marlon Brando's older brother. Nevertheless the film was a real hit. The story is very substantiated, simple and good, and has its brilliant depths. Take for example the character of Marlon Brando. He's a kid, a confused kid, stupid, bum but he has guts, courage and will, and Brando had portrayed that very well. The film didn't only fascinated me with its story per se. The drama, crime, romance and wits are balanced. The characters were also simply structured. You kind of hate them like Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb), kind of laugh at them like Father Barry (Karl Malden) and kind of confused like Terry and Charley (Marlon Brando and Rod Steiger). And even though the film was undoubtedly old, presented black and white, you still hear the story there. The story is beautiful. Very simple, and Brando certainly deserved the Oscar he won.",

He comes across as every man, a hardworking self-reliant dockworker who is faced with curruption and caught up in the criminal life that his brother forces on him. The editing in the film is very well done. There are clever match cuts for example the scene where K.O. Dugan is killed ""Pops"" says ""he doesn't need a doctor he needs a priest"" and then it cuts to Father Barry giving him his last rights. Another great example of editing is when Terry confesses his involvement in the murder to Eddie there is a cut to a steam boat and his voice is overpowered by the sound creating a heightened feeling of anxiety.",
265,12 September 2003,Laitue_Gonflable,9, A better director could have made a great film greater,"I've had problems with Elia Kazan from the moment I saw East of Eden in high school. It seems to me that a director with such high acclaim and so many wonderful films, must be a master craftsman. But I just don't see it at all. With On the Waterfront, in particular, his directing style seems awfully stagnant; there's really nothing to it. And really, the wonderful storyline must be extracted by the audience, we're not really treated to it, like in the works of other greats of the time.",
266,8 June 2005,sirpetertheknight,9, Just further proof that there will never be another Brando.,"But before we get to Brando,let's go over the rest of the film. Kazan shows us why he's regarded as one of the best film makers of this (or any) century. The film is bleak and gritty, a study of both human evil and human decency. It shows us the terrible mob dealings on a waterfront, that prevent anyone outside the mob's inner workings from getting the light work, or a decent days wage. The characters are brilliant and engrossing. Karl Malden plays a preacher who is very much beyond the simple, weak man f God. He is strong and just. Lee J. Cobb plays Mobster Johnny Friendly, who in one character spans all degrees of evil, from greed to murderous revenge. Eva Marie Saint is possibly the weakest of the main characters as the love interest, but considering this was her first film, she's remarkably well versed and played. Rod Steiger defies all logic in that, as the brother, he manages to further, and in some places better, the man I'm about to discuss. Brando gives not only the performance of his, but all our lifetimes. As Mob Muscle and Longshoreman Terry Malloy, Brando acts dumb, violent and ultimately, beautiful. His performance is frequently cited as cinema's best ever, and there's little to deny that. He is more realistic than most real people, and his performance almost eclipses the entire film. That it doesn't is simply because the film is so unbelievably good to begin with. And by the way, I cried when he said ""I Coulda Been A Contender.""",
267,20 April 2006,arlenekordell,8," Most obviously, there's Brando","Most obviously there is Brando. There is his ""Oh Charlie"" in the back seat of the taxi. There is his picking up of her glove, his seemingly unconscious fiddling with it, his putting it on his own hand, endearing us to him, softening him, opening his masculine casing to reveal some tender something inside. There is also the mythic structure of the plotSteinbeck said in East of Eden that there are only two stories, and that they both come from the same book, Genesis: 1) The fall of Adam and Eve 2) The murder of Abel by Cain. With On the Waterfront we have a version of the Cain and Abel story, revised though, revised by Abel (Brando), he comes back to triumph. The movie is not strict allegory. Nor should it be. But the basic thread, the testing and defining of loyalty between brothers, it is told almost as well in On the Waterfront as it is in Genesis, in a revised version of course.",

This film won best picture in 1954, which isn't surprising when you have Marlon Brando as the main star; he's best known decades later in The Godfather(1972). My only nitpicks with this film is that occasionally the music can be overly obnoxious and could be a struggle to hear what the people are saying. But, in a lot of cases the use of overly dramatic sounds can be in the movie's favor. This could be in the scene where Terry runs to see Edie; it's revealing something in the priest's point of view and you could hardly hear what they say at parts. That may be one of my favorite parts! Also, the end is well done and perfectly shot. Plus it has a lot of quotable lines like: ""I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender.

I haven't seen much better beginnings than that, and trust me I've seen a lot of movies. The rest of the movie was as good as the beginning.

It gives a look into a world that somebody coming from the Midwest really doesn't understand especially somebody coming from our times. Mommy asleep familiar with blue-collar working worlds but not the sense that you show up to your work every day hoping to or not to Get a shift. And with this system is taken advantage of by the mob who forces the union workers to take out loans which in turn means they have to pay a vig, It creates a corrupt system.

But a few months ago, I finally decided to check out one of Brando's ""classic"" films. I bought, without having ever seen before, ""On The Waterfront"". And I can tell you, as a passionate film viewer, I was not disappointed.

292,29 June 2005,fatleprechan,10," From a Time Long Forgotten, 'On The Waterfront' Still Endures and Endears","Director Elia Kazan's harsh portrait of a monopolized Cleveland lake front and its beleaguered dock workers is just as good today as it was the first time I watched it, and as I'm sure it was when it was released in 1954. When ex prize fighter Terry, portrayed by the one and only Marlon Brando is given a cushy job inside the warehouse by corrupt Union boss Johnny Friendly, expertly portrayed by Lee J. Cobb. largely because his brother 'Charlie the Gent' Another outstanding performance by Rod Stieger, is in tight with Friendly and his gang of mob toughs. But Terry begins to have an attack of conscience after he unwittingly arranges the murder of acquaintance Joey Doyle at the the hands of Friendly's ruffians. His situation is further clouded when he runs into a sympathetic priest ( Reuniting Brando with his old friend Karl Malden ) and the sister of the murdered Joey, Edie ( Portrayed by Eve Marie Saint in her stunning screen debut ) Although there's plenty of action and Brando is usually remembered for his famous 'I could have been a contender' scene opposite Stieger, the most fascinating scenes to me occur between Brando as the unrefined Terry and Saint as the parochial Edie. The dialogue between the two, which starts out as sort of a teasing banter, and grows more serious at a pace perfectly commanded by master director Kazan. Is realistic and spaced nicely. At one point early in the film Terry says 'I bet you don't remember me do you?' Saint replies with the perfectly delivered line. 'I remember the first time I ever saw you.' At that exact second, a note from the musical score kicks in to enhance the scene. This is an exact imitation of the early moments of a love relationship. Although the story of the dock workers fighting for their rights at the risk of their very lives is compelling, This is one of the most dynamic love stories in the history of cinema, Their love seemingly appears out of nowhere and beats incredible odds to persevere. As Terry's character tries not to buckle under or succumb from the pressure of each conflicting side. There is plenty off other good work from the rest of the cast, Cobb has some comical lines as the overbearing and ruthless Johnny Friendly. And Malden is a stalwart as always as the workingman friendly clergymen. But the film belongs to Brando, who finally received the Oscar after incredulously being denied the prize for his amazing performance in 'Streetcar Named Desire' And of course director Kazan who's stark black and white scenes were managed flawlessly and coordinated seamlessly with both the actors and the tender musical score. There is not one frame out of place, or one thing I would have changed about this film. A timeless and touching American icon. As good as you've heard. 10 out of a possible 10 T.H.",

Some of it's impact is nullified by the slate of knock-offs on it's theme over the ensuing years, but you just can't replicate great performances by Brando, Malden, Steiger, and Cobb.

He is an excellent actor though, and he portrayed the role of Terry beautifully. Terry was definitely the protagonist in this film. Johnny Friendly was the antagonist. It was interesting to view the character of Terry blossom as he goes through the experience of guilt and love simultaneously. This was a classic mobster film and it definitely had a dark and very serious feel to it. A lot of the shots were very dark, even during the day. I didn't notice anything special about the sound of the film. The narrative was continuous and the editing was seamless. The use of the same shot at different points in the movie, the pigeon cage, allowed the viewer to really get in touch with the guilt that Terry was feeling and the emotional torment he was dealing with. I thoroughly enjoyed this film.",

Some scenes contain a certain amount of fog to give the viewer more of a sense that there is more area there than just what is in the framing. The sound is very quiet when needed and it is loud where it needs to be loud. The first half of the movie has almost no non diagetic sound, but the second half gradually increases the dramatic music as the situation gets more crazy. Sound effects are used to help tell very small parts of the story that happen off screen like someone throwing a piece of paper.",
302,12 December 2014,ryklinker,9, An ex-boxer working as a longshoreman must decide to stand up to his gang-influenced union bosses,"From the first scene, it is easy to see that he is caught in the middle of a difficult situation. Terry Malloy has joined the corruption that plagues his workplace; the docks of New York. Each day as he stands in the group of men wanting to work that day on the waterfront, he is falling victim to the corrupt bosses running the docks. As his brother is a member of the head boss' inner circle, Terry is caught in this situation. He has helped in the murder of a man who knew too much, and he didn't want it to be this way. Unlike his brother, Terry's moral compass is better calibrated, and he soon decides that he needs to end the exploitation of the workers on the waterfront. While on his journey, he meets Edie; the sister of the man that Terry helped kill. From his first glance, he has loved her; however, Edie is unaware of his dark past at first, and once she finds out, she stands right alongside Terry. Finally mustering up the courage, Terry engages the bosses face-to-face.",
303,13 December 2009,als_1223,9, Excellent,"I originally saw this film because after meeting one of my favorite actors, he mentioned that this was his favorite film. After watching it again, I loved it even more. Watching Brando portray the very complex and guilt ridden yet very in love Terry Malloy made me appreciate his acting skills even more so. You could just see that he was lost in the character and it made the movie very believable. Steiger's Charley Malloy and Saint's Edie also played their characters quite well. A viewer could get the idea that Charley was both loyal to his brother and Friendly, which put him in a big predicament, and ultimately set the tone for the rest of the movie. I really enjoyed the way that the movie was made to seem like it was very dark throughout, with the fog used a lot, and the darkness of the shots. Even something as ugly as docks looked beautifully haunting with the editing and cinematography. I also liked learning about what director Elia Kazan was going through during the time, having to stand trial and name names to HUAC (House of UnAmerican Activities Committee), which seemed to be put into the plot of the movie, when Terry needs to testify against Friendly in front of the Crime Commission. All in all, this is a wonderful mob classic, that everyone, Brando fan or not, should watch.",

Karl Malden, Rod Steiger, and Lee J. Cobb deliver stong supporting roles, the strongest of which is Karl Malden's role as a Priest who is set to find out the truth behind the murders on the waterfront. Karl Malden deserved the best supporting actor Oscar of '54, definitely. A mixture overall of classic scenes and quotes and a great story, On the Waterfront seems to be a masterpiece, and well deserved the Oscar for best picture of '54.

Terry then starts falling in love with Edie Doyle (Eva Marie Saint in her first film role) whose brother was ordered to be killed by Johnny.

The film also has one of the greatest speaking scenes in movie history. The scene of course is the conversation between Terry and his brother, Charlie, in the back of a taxicab.

This scene is probably the most famous scene from this film and for good reason. It is a display of two of the greatest performances ever committed to film. It is powerful and full of emotion and raw energy. The way it is shot by Kazan and by the exchange between two of the greatest method actors of their time. This scene is also the pivotal point in the picture, we find out so much about these two characters, their past and their future. Here Brando explains his frustration with his brother and his brother's line of work. It has cost him his future, and he is forced to realize the painful truth; he is a bum. Steiger is equally good in this scene, here he makes a desperate plea to his brother, a plea that if not headed could mean the end of both of their lives, near the end of the scene you can see Steiger has made peace with the fact that he has failed in persuading his brother and that he is now a dead man.",

As The Beatles are a legend among their own kind, so is this movie among other actors and movie makers. This is the film that made Brando a brand name. Just as he did in 'Streetcar named desire"" he has made the tortured soul of Terry Malloy so irrevocably himself that anyone else attempting that role may be committing career suicide. Much of the films popularity may be due to the fact that Terry's yearning to break free of Johnny Friendly is something inherent in all of us. We all have Johnny Friendly's in our lives at some point and we suffer a lack of self respect if we do not stand tall and breaking free of him. I think the final scenes in this movie are so satisfying for that reason. Lee J Cobbs portrayal of this suffocating entity is a masterpiece. Here again, it is difficult to see anyone else in this role. I can't imagine that there is anyone out there that has not seen this movie but if YOU haven't, you must make it your next rental.

He spoke of the crucification,talked about souls,and yet he did not quote God's 6th Commandment,Thou Shalt Not Kill.Even though this was not a religious film there was still a religious character in it.Who spoke of God and Christ,but never quoted God's 8th Commandment,Thou Shalt Not Steal,which the mob was doing from these union workers The movie could've been more powerful if it were mentioned some of God's Commandments.",

It just seemed that everything had been set up perfectly for him to give it his all. Everyone always hails Brando in the taxicab scene but Rod Steiger was exceptional at supporting him. As too Eva Marie Saint the debutant who used Brando's brilliance for her acting as well. The taxicab scene is the greatest ever scene in film history pipping The Untouchables gun fight. When anybody who has seen the film talks about it they will always mention the cab scene but when Terry sees his brother dead and says 'Charlie i'm gonna take it outta their skulls' I think it is just as powerful. There is one part in the film when Brando is talking to Eva Marie Saint and she drops her glove by accident but instead of cutting Brando picked it up and fiddled with to show his uneasiness. Not many actors can do that and the director Elia Kazan said afterwards that he should take no credit for the improvisation from Brando apart from that he did not cut it and just allowed it. The whole theme of redemption was so realistic and when Brando says 'I cudda had class I cudda been a contender ' he has finally realized his own dream and realized that he lost it all because of his weak brother. Its an incredibly powerful film that deserved its 8 Oscars. Personally I don't think anybody has seen real acting until they have seen On the Waterfront. Pure class, Pure Brando.",

Brando's portrayal of Terry just shines with class. His relaxed style stands in contrast to the other characters in the movies but that's not to take away from the other actors who provide a backdrop to this no nonsense drama.,

336,23 October 2009,andrew-simoes,9, Nothing more gripping and tense.,"I admit I'm a sucker for classical soundtracks and On The Waterfront is Leonard Bernstein's only original. I feel the audio adds almost as much as the video and most of the modern movie soundtracks leave a lot to be asked for. A good orchestra playing in the background adds so much tension to a film and the stark black and white set was just perfect for it. Add a crisp and racy script, my favourite actor Marlon Brando at the height of his powers in my favourite type of film ( a mob-drama ) and you get a classic which has made all films after it look tame. It's pace is cracking; the blend of drama, suspense and the little romance super and the individual performances terrific. What really stand out are the performances of Lee J Cobb and Rod Steiger. Not even slightly overdone, just perfect. Brando's performance is the best yet seen on screen ; will probably remain so for another fifty years. At the end there is redemption of a kind which brings the entire movie together. And it's a lamentable fact that this film is languishing at no 103 on this list below crap like The Matrix, Braveheart , Goodfellas, Memento , Se7en, The Dark Knight .. the list goes on. It seems to me that the majority of voters can't handle art in its true form and dislike a movie just because its old. Very sad. There is only one place this movie deserves to be and that is FIRMLY IN THE TOP 10.",

Elia Kazan, Marlon Brando two of the great rebels of cinema, arguably they represent the absolute in their field of work, from the birth of method acting not many have been as influential to American cinema since the 1950's onwards. Both team up again after the success of 'A Streetcar Named Desire' accompanied again by Karl Malden who plays the brave Father Barry. Eva Marie Saint appears alongside Brando as Edie Doyle, effortlessly beautiful but always backed up with bags of talent as she displayed for Alfred Hitchcock in 'North by Northwest.' ",
339,13 February 2005,bostbart,10, fantastic,"for those of us who have literary pretensions; this movie is at the very summit of great movies. The depth of acting talent, script, direction,location etc., create a synergistic masterpiece of the gritty world of corrupt urban unionism. It is no accident that it contains probably the most famous scene in movie history. The allegory to Christ, Terry Malloy - the modern day Jesus heading toward Golgotha, is the symbolism that drives the film. This is truly a film that should be seen and then later re-seen and then again etc. Like Shakespeare this work gets deeper and deeper as one delves and redelves into it. This masterwork will live on as the works of Bach, Michelangelo, and Rembrandt for as long as our civilization continues.",
340,26 January 2005,beanny007-1,10, It's NOT a New York film,"""On The Waterfront"" was not a film about the New York Waterfront. The main character, Terry Malloy, was based on a real person who worked the piers in Hoboken, NJ. The movie was filmed almost entirely in New Jersey in Hoboken except for one scene which was filmed in Brooklyn, NY. Many of the scenes in that film are places where I grew up as a child in Hoboken. When I saw the film I almost couldn't believe how Marlon Brando was standing in the very spot I used to ride my bike through. I'm proud to say good choice of demographics to the director, he captured the heart of The Waterfront.",
