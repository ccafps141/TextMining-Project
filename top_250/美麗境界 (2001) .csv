An intriguing story based on an interesting man, a great cast full of talented actors, the involvement of James Horner and Roger Deakins (perhaps one of the best modern cinematographers in the business) and Ron Howard as director (a very competent director with some great films under his belt, directing always with a lot of quality and polish if not always distinction).",r

And now, after seeing it, I thank her for that. Instead of spending two and a half hours watching George Clooney and Matt Damon rob casinos or Kevin Spacey and Julianne Moore dealing with their problems in New Foundland, I found myself pulled into another kind of story, a powerful, emotional story of how one man learned to battle his own demons and dazzle the world.",3
12,11 July 2011,planktonrules,8, Moving but overrated...,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is a film about the mathematician John Nash. It is very cleverly written and directed, as about mid-way through the film you learn something very, very interesting about the film.

Instead, Opie extracts the aspects of John Nash's life and person he decided we grown-ups couldn't handle. Gone is Nash's racism, snobbery, arrest for indecent exposure, history of violent behavior, messy relationships with both sexes, the woman and son he abandoned, the voices that told him aliens were transmitting messages to him via the New York Times, the repeated stays at various loony bins, the nine months he spent wandering Europe trying to renounce his citizenship, the fact that Alicia divorced him in 1963, and that their son is schizophrenic.

20,5 September 2002,susan_may21,9, Direction makes it beautiful,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is an exceptional story, but it is only and exceptional film because of its director.  Ron Howard does an amazing job of engaging his audience, introducing a brilliant main character, and making the audience experience the reality of mental illness.  This could have been an unbelievable story to which very people could relate; however, the directorial mastery Howard exhibits throughout allows the audience to accompany Nash on his journey and awareness of his illness.  Anyone who has been close to the frailties of the human mind will appreciate how respectfully and honestly this film approaches the subject.  Howard is able to portray all the complex reactions to mental illness while maintaining the humanity and dignity of the patient.  Superbly directed, wonderfully acted by Crowe and cast, this film succeeds on every level.",e

John Nash's life is beautifully picturized with all the complexities in his life. I could relate this movie to people in my life and I found this movie very authentic and true. Jennfier Conolly was superb in her role as Nash's suffering wife. I would rate this film as a MUST WATCH among the biopics.",f

But Nash had big dreams due to his mathematical genius until schizophrenia stole those dreams. What is great about this film is that the viewer does not know that Nash's imaginary friends are imaginary until the film reveals that fact. What is real to Nash is real to the audience, up to a point.",_

Unfortunately, the Hollywood treatment conveniently ignored the hard realities of what was actually a fascinating biography of a man struggling a lifetime to balance his genius and madness, leaving viewers with an abundance of sanitized movie madness scenes, very little glimpses of genius, and a romantic relationship with no apparent basis.

I bet he must have done his homework thousand times before finally bring it to the screen.

33,21 April 2002,bliss66,1, Complete Rubbish!,"This film is despicable garbage.  It has the bare-faced cheek to use a mental illness as an excuse to switch up cinematic genres and it's deeply offensive.  The first hour is completely incomprehensible filmmaking--why does no one, except the viewer, realise there's something wrong with Crowe, I mean, aside from all his bad acting?  Howard straight-jackets all the other actors to prolong his device of dual realities that once revealed, makes no sense whatsoever.  Why don't we as an audience view the sets as any normal person would and focus on Crowe's bizarre behavior?  Just so Howard can make us think we're watching a bad espionage thriller?  Why does every other actor in the film just stand around dumbfounded, forced to give maximus (erm, I mean, maximum) room to Crowe's showboating performance? And what were the details in Jennifer Connelly's pact with the devil to make this wretched film?  Her's is a great beauty that can be used to tremendous effect when a director knows what to do with (like Aronofsky in Requiem). Howard just heaps on the mascara and probably made her wear curlers to bed every night. I can only thank God there was a fire alarm in the cinema so I missed the wretched ""old age make-up"" scenes that looked likely to rival those in ""For The Boys.""  This is dire filmmaking and further proof--as if it were needed after the success of The Sixth Sense--that America has no culture.  Or taste.",

Going into it, I had average expectations, hearing the hyper over it over the years, and I've always had a tangible interest in conditions such as schizophrenia.

36,7 February 2002,willfilmone,1, Mental illness- Ron Howard style.,"Mental illness has never appeared so snuggly and warm. Watch Russell emote, tics a' flyin!  Watch lovely Jennifer Connelly start her descent into Calista Flockhearts diet zone! Listen to the heart tugging strings as the Ronnie Howard team schmaltzes up a good story and makes it all shiny and happy! The saccharine level was tough, but with enough salt from the popcorn counter I just about made it through. Never mind that the true story of this man is amazing, like Disney before him (and the glowy sitcoms that informed his 'early work') Mr. Howard takes a tough and beautiful story and grinds it down so that it's almost unrecognizable. Shameful how we eat it up.",

38,18 July 2007,MOscarbradley,5, A load of bull,"This hugely over-praised film was not only flavour of the month, it was flavour of the year and it went on to win the Academy Award as the year's best picture. The fact that it isn't really very good didn't seem to matter; it made mathematics sexy in the form of Russell Crowe as the real life mathematician and paranoid-schizophrenic John Nash and it conformed to Hollywood's idea of paranoid-schizophrenia, (fantasy characters that the audience sees just the way John sees them; a charismatic star who can overact all over the place but with whom the audience can empathize). Actually, Crowe isn't half bad, especially in the first half of the film before the madness really takes hold. Once it does it's all stops out and the script doesn't really help; there are no subtleties or shadings to it. When the pieces fall into place the film seems alarmingly conventional.",
39,4 February 2004,Angeneer,4, Pathetic,"A completely dumbed-down and whitewashed version of the life of John Nash. The really interesting part, namely the Nash Theorem and the Nash Equilibrium, are just mentioned, no one actually cared to explain why these contributed to game theory and economics and earned him the Nobel prize. Instead of that, we get a ridiculous and unrealistic depiction of his schizophrenia, Crowe babbling as an idiot, Conelly in the most unbelievable, sexist, dumb role they could ever write for Nash's wife and clichés of academic life, institutions, interpersonal relationships etc. Only Christopher Plummer, Ed Harris and the make-up department were actually worth their salaries. A film destined to please brain-dead people, I guess that's why the Academy liked it anyway.",

44,16 October 2007,dataconflossmoor,10, Unprecedented Genius Often Times Goes Unnoticed!!!,"It is difficult to acknowledge anyone who is above and beyond the run of the mill!! People possessing ability or prodigal genius are often times, not even aware of it!!Russel Crowe is sensational in this movie, as he plays Nobel Peace Prize winner, John Nash!! A critical prerequisite to an actor or actress executing a role effectively, is that he or she can astutely grasp a thorough understanding of the role itself!! This film has a performance by Russel Crowe that can be compared with Tom Hanks performance in ""Forrest Gump"" and Matt Damon's performance in ""Good Will Hunting"". All three actors in these movies established a noteworthy precedent in the cinema industry by portraying characters who had an intense comprehension of the character's adamant convictions!! In all three cases, these characters had a self worth which exuded an unintentional greatness!! ""A Beautiful Mind"" deals with an individual named John Nash, a hermit with an unassuming cerebral charisma who is considered gifted (i.e. not normal). The denotative explanation of normal is ordinary... This individual is extraordinary!! Not normal is often times referred to in these precarious terms... strange, different, or unusual!!! A person who drives a Rolls Royce is strange!! A baseball team that wins the World Series is different!! A person who becomes a CEO of a Fortune 500 Company is unusual!! An exceptionally brilliant mind is not normal, this movie depicts the ramifications of such a blessing in disguise!!! Reality becomes a rude awakening for John Nash (Russel Crowe). His brilliance is not always easy to empathize with because his actions are so reckless!! He perpetually demonstrates a relentless affliction with formidable schizophrenic influences!! Many people who deal with John Nash encounter this illness with trepidation, and it throws them into a tailspin!! For John Nash, this is an obsessive preoccupation which requires a necessary detachment!! The producers of this movie want the audience to view John Nash's (Russel Crowe's) mental handicap like you are from the outside looking in!! It is for this reason that this movie manufactures a succinct obviation of emotional security for John Nash as a way of giving the movie audience a thorough conception of Professor Nash's dilemma!! Ultimately, he attains a noteworthy recognition from Princeton's prominent academia!! This is an accolade which most of us only dream about!! Ronny Howard and Brian Grazer do a remarkable job at directing this film, as their creativity homogenizes!! Their cooperation with the coordinating producers, as well as the actors and actresses in the movie, was not perfunctory, rather, they engaged in a rudimentary commiseration with virtually everyone who was involved in the creation of this film!! The acting in this movie is terrific!! Why the acting is so terrific in this movie, is mostly on account of the fact that all of the performers in this film were mutually challenged!! ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a marvelous film which left an indelible impact on the intellectually sensitive movie viewers!! Perhaps many of them painstakingly pondered the statement of ""I need to believe that something extraordinary is possible"". What is normal is ordinary, and, what is not normal has the potential to be extraordinary!! If you stop and think about it, it is truly enlightening when something extraordinary occurs!! If you can thoroughly conceptualize this, than the directors of this film have attained a zenith in artistic gratification which is absolutely spectacular!!",

46,18 April 2002,stensson,3, Dear IMDb voters,"How is it possible to give this an average of 8 points? This is a lying movie, without compassion, without even the slightest realism in portraying mental illness, without even good acting.",
47,4 June 2005,mchubirka,1, Typical Hollywood Whitewash,"Even if you ignore the fact that Nash's homosexuality was completely ignored by the film, what about his first son who was never mentioned? The one he failed to support financially. What about his strained relationship with his wife? What about the ridiculous and non-factual introduction of his imaginary friends, which are used as a Greek chorus by Howard and the writers, because they can't move the story along any other way. Don't waste your time with the movie, read the book which is infinitely more interesting and gives you a real sense of the human being. Not this badly directed and filmed Hollywood whitewash. Ron Howard is probably one of the least interesting directors working in Hollywood today. So save your time and money, watch the PBS documentary or read the book.",

50,26 January 2002,Billy_Crash,3, A Beautiful Skewed History,"It's hard to watch a film on real history when that history is skewed. Therefore, since this movie refuses to acknowledge important facts, it falls way short of anything worthwhile. Granted, a book is a book, a screenplay is a screenplay and a movie is a movie, and in the face of fiction, liberties may be taken, but when they altered in light of fact, then the whole work is subsequently meaningless. By no means should this film earn any praises come Oscar night - especially for Best Screenplay when it's far from it.",
51,11 February 2002,whatdoes1know,1," would have been a great short film, documentary, or anything else...","Russel Crowe proves to be a decent actor, going from college to shaking old man, his acting and the make-up artist who worked on him did a great teamwork. On the other hand, Jennifer Connelly does not age well throughout the movie, and this is critical in supporting the creativity of using a cinematographic gaffe to visualize a concept dealing with the beautiful mind in question. And suddenly, the make-up ages her so strangely that she looks pretty darn close to Helena Bonham Carter from Planet of the Apes! Plot twists a la ""The Others""--to name something other than that movie with Bruce Willis and the kid, keep you watching, and moments of brilliance such as the theory with which John Nash proves John Adams wrong using a blonde and her friends, build up the expectations which are completely blown off by the less than satisfactory shallow talk on which the movie ends. When strings of movies came out as Pulp Fiction wannabes (the original itself from a John Woo wannabe), things were recognizably bad. Now that Night Shamalyan wannabes bring out their visual twists to their wannabe movies, things like this movie come out--you can't directly tell how bad it is, because the visual trickstery feels original, even though the device has been explored already with a better story--even though the gaffes in the movies give the movie very different unintended interpretations.

52,7 June 2021,carmenneverxx,5, Hollywood Fantasy,"Mediocre movie at best. It was so simplistic and full of clichés I couldn't stop rolling my eyes. Lacked the nuance. Maybe it's just targeted towards younger audience, I'm not sure, but I was obliged to watch it for psychology class and I don't even think it's an accurate portrayal of schizophrenia. Maybe it's because I knew what it's supposed to be about and therefore the movie was badly predictable. The romance came out of nowhere and Alicia was just a painfully stereotypical female love interest with no real substance. All of the science stuff was comical in it's simplicity. The ending dragged for a very long time and it was very sweet which I like but it didn't feel earned.",
53,25 December 2001,Quinoa1984,8, A Splendid job turned in by Crowe and Howard,"Ron Howard brings forth one of his best and most serious films to date, A Beautiful Mind.  It examines a mathematical wizard named John Forbes Nash Jr. who created a discovery in game theory that is still used today for a number of things.  But the film isn't so much about math (what film is?) as it is about the man's struggles with a disease in his mind that drives him to madness yet somehow is able to try and fight it to the best of his abilities, which aren't always as high as they could be.  This man is played by Russell Crowe who gives another top shelve performance to add with The Insider, L.A. Confidential and Romper Stomper (Gladiator I don't really count as a top shelve performance), and he plays Mr. Nash so well it doesn't need to be thought that he's immitating him as much as being him.

The dialogue is sparsely entertaining and barely keeps any flow going.  Crowe is his usual mediocre-acting self (who will get glowing reviews of course). Connelly was solid but hardly Oscar worthy.  The movie was not developed very well especially in the beginning when his genius was in question. I fell asleep & I never fall asleep at the movies. Don't pay $9 for this one. Rent it if you're bored on a weekend. You may enjoy it but it's not a 'can't miss'. The Hollywood hype machine just keeps on rolling..,

I only watched this because everybody was ranting on that it was a good movie and what not.

As just a movie, I can see some people will find it interesting. But the movie presents rubbish about Economics and Nash and, of course, game theory. Nash didn't invent game theory as the movie kind of tried to portray. He came up with a notion of equilibrium whoich is simply brilliant and he more than deserves the Nobel.  I think coming up with the equilibrium notion is more of a contribution than iventing game theory. But of course they had to change it to make it sexy enough. The movie is full of lies like this. I understand that most people will not enjoy the movie as much if it were truthful. Nevertheless, that doesn't change the fact that the movie lied about game theory. I think it was awful",
60,27 June 2002,kehsmith,1," ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a terrible thing to waste your time on","I cannot believe the people that rave about this movie.  ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a terrible thing to waste your time on.  The movie's direction is manipulative and the screenplay is horrid.  I thought this was suppose to be based on the true life of John Nash.  Didn't his wife divorce him in real life? Yes, she did.  Wasn't Nash a homosexual? (Nash says no, but.) Yeah, right, Mr. Nash.  Let's not use truths here let's just make up some stuff that an audience will like.  Well, Hollywood, I might have liked the movie more if his wife had divorced him or if there was a homosexual tinge to the film.  I needed to feel for the character and all this character was is a jerk.  Hell, he says it himself, ""I have a chip on both shoulders"".  The movie makes him come off as a womanizing jerk.  How can I care about him. Well, because Hollywood says we should feel for him and the media says it is a great film.  That's why we like it.  Give me a break.  I know this day will never come, but, I sure wish it would, when will people learn to make there own decisions about movies, music and tv shows, etc. instead of allowing themselves to be conned into liking something just because the media says it is good.  And, don't get me started on the Academy Awards because all that is now is a popularity contest.  The best films or actors or screenplays, whatever, might get nominated but they don't have a chance in hell winning, ie.  ""Memento"", ""Ghost World"", ""Mulholland Drive"", etc.",

My first question revolved around Mr. Crowe's Princeton roommate, Paul Bettany (as Charles). I could not understand why Mr. Bettany did not pal around with the college bar crowd. Crowe was there, with a group of other students, but no mixing with Bettany. Why? Obviously, Bettany loved to imbibe; so, he should have been the life of the party, I thought.

69,20 July 2007,moonspinner55,7," Though designed to be prestigious, the beauty does manage to come through","Academy Award winner for Best Picture begins at Princeton, 1947, where mathematician John Nash (played by Russell Crowe) is flailing away at an economics theory while all his male classmates just want to get laid (the film equates the average Princeton male to the type of guys usually found on TV's ""Happy Days""). Five years later, Nash is working with the Pentagon on numerical formation patterns and appears to be pulled into a conspiracy plot to thwart the Russians from detonating their H-Bomb on American soil. It isn't surprising that ""A Beautiful Mind"" won the Oscar; it has been designed specifically for prestige (i.e., awards). However, it's a sentimental, dramatic package which gives its time-worn movie theme--mental illness--a few new twists courtesy screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, adapting Sylvia Nasar's biography of John Forbes Nash Jr. (the Academy normally frowns upon edgy concepts, yet this one has an old-fashioned set-up, which they welcome, plus a lead performance preconceived to be a triumph). After a rocky first hour, the picture does improve. Howard methodically sets up the plot mechanisms, but gives us a fascinating main character who is disconnected, a failure at social interaction, and a really bad first date. Nash's future-wife (Jennifer Connelly) isn't particularly intriguing or enchanting (she has dim thoughts, such as ""God must be a painter, why else would there be so many colors?""). Still, by the second act, Nash's personal crisis has become more clear to us, more involving and gripping, and Crowe isn't so much deliberately one-note as he is intensely focused (the actorly tics come later...and, when they do, they are almost endearing). The film has that slick look of ""grand entertainment"" that makes critics bow their heads, yet there are indeed miraculous moments: Nash neglecting to take his medicine and discovering an entire covert operation going down in his backyard shed; Nash, recuperating, riding his bicycle in an infinity pattern, scribbling numbers in the air with his finger. The mental institution stuff is the cinematic equivalent of treading water (and wastes Christopher Plummer as a doctor), but the last half of the film is quite good: a brilliant but disturbed professor working his damnedest to overcome his demons, helped along by a loving woman and receiving the kind of respect he never dreamed of. Howard isn't always graceful or sensitive (especially in the electric shock sequence), but he does resurrect a tired genre and ultimately makes it a moving experience. *** from ****",

It is about John Nash, a genial mathematician who suffers a mental illness and has to confront the disease. The picture is empowered by the great cast, the inspired writing and an almost perfect technical department: the score, the editing, the cinematography are all solid but the direction by Ron Howard is superb. It wasn't an easy movie to direct because of the nature of the story it tells, but Howard was able to enrich the writing with his work behind the camera, a very remarkable job. The movie is technically excellent but this is not its strength, it's the way in which all the emotions flow from the screen to the viewer.

Taken in and of itself the film is rather ordinary among excellent films and not worthy of much of the critical acclaim it garnered. I personally found much of the film uninteresting, tedious, and downright boring. After all, how does one relate to someone whose accomplishments are so abstract as to be buried in esoteric symbolism and someone whose illness is so intangible as to be a state of mind? The beauty of mathematics and the war with the demons of delusions were not brought sufficiently into focus by the film which spent too much time trying to develop a rather uninteresting character, making his delusions our delusions, spicing it up with a car chase and shootout, fleshing out the mental ghosts, and showing the principal's eccentricism with endless scribbling on window glass.

Another thing is the film is very much a plain account, a mere biography, of some brilliant mathematician who had to struggle with severe schizophrenia. Nothing earth-shaking and not much to work with besides retelling the story, this film deals a lot with just events rather than a cinematographic interpretation of those events, and the parts that are indeed rendered movie magic are over-celebrated, emotionally void and subtlety-deprived moments that engage the audience forcefully with overdramatic music and classic thick cinematic methods rather than through a strength built through heart and genuine emotion.

I have never seen as self-centered performance as Russell Crowe's.  Throughout the entire movie he might as well be saying ""I'm going to win an Oscar for playing this freak.  HA!""  He has no respect for the amazing man that he is playing, you can see that in his incredibly cliched movements that look like he read a book about what crazy people do, marked exactly where he was going to do these movements, and then executed them without thinking if this is the right time or if it makes sense for the character to do them then.  I was so relieved when he did not win the Oscar, but I didn't think Denzel Washington's performance in Training Day was all that spectacular, but it was more of a career award for him.  Russell Crowe, however, has had a career about as impressive as a box of hair.  Jennifer Connelly was just okay.  I didn't see anything spectacular or Oscar-worthy in her performance, she just sort of screamed and looked worried and disheveled.

First of all Nash was a genius at mathematics and this is what the movie should have been about not a story about a man who was cured and who found love at the end and so on. Also there are a lot of scenes that were just plain wrong - the scene where he rode around with a bike at the campus happened in his early university years not after it. In my opinion Russell Crowe didn't fit to this part at all since he doesn't look the intelligent/individualist type, therefore he really couldn't play one. It would have been great if it would have focused more on the mathematics (similar to Pi) and not the over-dramatized lovelife.

OK , we get it; the guy is sick and suffers schizoid and paranoid delusions. So did my mother, but I tended to overlook her problems because of her wonderful outstanding qualities. They should have done the same in this film. The scenes depicting Nash's talents and accomplishments were far more inspirational than the cheesy attempts to include us in his delusions. We know he is delusional after the first few scenes with the bogeyman from the CIA or NSA.

The way Howard normalized Nash's schizophrenia and tried to get the audience to understand it more was an achievement in itself. At first it is hard to realize Nash's condition with all his eccentricities, abruptness and his incredible intelligence it becomes hard to know he is crazy. The way his delusions seemed so real it became hard to know when it was real and when he had his delusions. Some may criticize the movie because of the spy stuff and other stuff added as just another Hollywood thrill. This just shows the skill of Ron howard to create a picture of insanity identical to reality. While Russell playing nash you never question how realistic the portrayal is, he doesn't rely on makeup or anything elaborate, his walk, words and voice is what makes the character more alive. The performance of Jennifer Connelly was a very added addition to the movie. The chemistry between Crowe and Connelly really gel and you feel that they belong to each other. Every part of the movie came together perfectly and they all complimented each other that made it a more inspiring piece of work. A lot of people should see this movie not just cause Crowe is in it or of who made the movie but because of what you can learn by watching it. Hopefully learning compassion when dealing with the mentally ill. By new found knowledge the next time you see someone talking to themselves or someone you know has a disorder you might understand what they might go through and that they will be needing your continued love. Since they will be just as frustrated and confused as you might be. If you wanna see a movie where everything fits and everyone is at the top of their game then this is a movie for you.",

Russell Crowe plays Nobel Prize winning mathematician John Nash from his college days till his late days as a professor. He contracts a mental illness that has a tragic affect on his career, marriage and sanity. He is seeing images of people that are not really there there but he struggles in differentiating what is real and what is fantasy. Directed by Ron Howard with an intriguing visual style. This is easily one of his greatest directing achievements along with Apollo 13. Russell Crowe as Nash struggles to regain his dignity and sense of purpose. Jennifer Connelly is wonderful as his supportive wife who remains with him through all the tests and disappointments. Ed Harris is terrific as a vision feeding his mind with turmoil. Paul Bettany plays a tampering roommate who attempts to bring a sense of excitement to his life. Christopher Plummer plays a doctor whom Nash believes is heading agents whom are after him but he believes that Nash needs medication. Easily one of the best films of the year with superb visual appeal and its examination regarding one's battle with reality and fantasy and knowing that hope looms ahead. It is a beautiful film displaying one's triumph against overbearing odds. Score: 10 / 10",

Almost all of them had paranoid delusions of conspiracies against them, and almost all heard voices, which is what Nash experienced. Usually the voices are condemnatory and frightening. It's hard to show that visually, so the screenwriters make up completely bogus ""symptoms"" that are a false depiction of what schizophrenics actually suffer. No sense arguing back and forth about whether the movie's depiction of Nash's ordeal is believable. It isn't what actually happened to him.",

138,10 March 2006,Hitchcoc,9, A great character study.,"Ron Howard is certainly a prize. There is such a danger when one plays with the audience's sense of reality, that things will become so confusing as to destroy any consistent engagement. The story of John Nash is remarkable. First of all, we have this brilliant man, this genius. He carries on daily discourse and is a success in every endeavor. However, underlying everything is the hallucinatory world of his disease. How do you respond to the correct reality when there are so many. How do you go on when you know that some of the people you speak with aren't real; that some of the issues dominating your life are objects of paranoia and fear. Howard and Crowe pull this off in full view of the audience. When the movie is over, we understand. Then there is the fact that there are people who wake up every morning and face the type of day that this man does. If he were a raving lunatic it would be one thing. But he continues to make his way through life. Those around him are constantly off balance because they have to recognize that what he says may have not foundation.

140,14 May 2002,VivienLeighsnumber1fan,1, On of the most Beautiful Pictures Made!!,"This movie has a little bit of everything- creativity, romance, a love that truly is for better or for worse, suspense, action, and taste. I have to admit- before this movie, I was never really a Russell Crowe fan, due in part to his reputation for being arrogant and obnoxious. I really went to see the movie because Jennifer Connelly and I are the same age and I grew up seeing her face in Sears' catalogs, never having seen any of her acting performances. But when I saw Russell and the enormity of acting talent he put forth in this movie, I was completely blown away. How wrong I was for opinionating myself and using my opinion to decide whether or not I would see any of his movies. This movie impressed me so much that I went out and rented all the Russell Crowe movies available to me, and all I can say is: Boy have I missed out through the years. His true personality radiates in every character he plays, and he was surely the right choice for the lead in ""A Beautiful Mind"". Jennifer Connelly was outstanding as Alicia Nash, and together, her and Russell were a ""Beautiful Pair"". Paul Bettany was also great. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone in any age group, due in large part to the message it conveys- a beautiful mind, a mind that can appreciate the deeper things that most of us can't, can be a troubled one, and those closest to that""beautiful mind"" should never give up hope and keep close in mind the important things in life- compassion, long-suffering, and most of all: L-O-V-E.

141,2 March 2002,ViolentVinnie,1, An ugly bore.,"Moviegoers watch out! Russell Crowe is on the lose to bore you to death in this overacted, poorly crafted piece of Hollywood kitsch. Basically the movie is about the life and the fight with schizophrenia of John Nash, a college professor. So far so bad. As the story might have offered some interesting possibilities the film shows us Russell Crowe overacting as bad as he could possibly do. At no time through this 134 minute piece of boredom the viewer can actually believe that John Nash is supposed to be a mathematical genius. We rather get the impression of a clumsy, slighty overweighed farmer strolling around campus. The only reason one would stay in the theater is the beautiful Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris who delivers yet another great supporting performance. This is by no way an Oscar movie and I will cry bitter tears if Russell Crowe takes away the best male again. Avoid the movie!!",
142,19 February 2007,Sylviastel,10, A Princeton State of Mind!,"The cost of brilliance might be madness. You don't need to look further than the brilliant math genius John Nash played here by Oscar Winner Russell Crowe. He should have won another Academy Award for Best Actor in this role. It's not easy at Princeton University. They probably didn't flinch an eyeball in their ivy digs over the Oscars. It's the kind of university where it takes a whole lot to impress those ivy geniuses. After all, they have Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison, author Joyce Carol Oates, and Nobel prize winners on their faculty as well. Ron Howard said he loved filming in Princeton, New Jersey which doesn't seem to fit in the rest of stereotypical New Jersey. It's like another world of it's own where geniuses discuss politics, history, economics, math, and literature. It's hardly believable that some of them probably don't own television sets because they think it's waste of time and a distraction but they probably have computers instead. Princeton is a state of mind and a place where the mind is valued more than the body. With brilliance comes madness for John Nash. Ron Howard creates a beautiful film based on John Nash's story of suffering and demons that battles his mind for control. I like the casting of Judd Hirsch and Jennifer Connolly as the loving, devoted wife. John Nash will be remembered for this film more than his brilliance but that he was human just like the rest of us.",
143,22 September 2005,JamesHitchcock,7, Triumph of the Spirit,"Director Ron Howard has the reputation of making intellectually undemanding films, often with a sentimental, uplifting theme, and ""A Beautiful Mind"" is no exception.

The film points out that these theories have influenced a number of fields of activity, including economics and evolutionary biology, but does not go into any detail about the nature of that influence. The film is rather an example of the ""triumph of the human spirit over adversity"" type of biopic, the adversity over which Nash triumphs being the schizophrenia from which he suffered.",

I have seen this movie as well as ""Cinderella Man"", and Russell Crow has this acting thing down. I'm a sucker for biopics as it is, but honestly Ron Howard did a great job directing and Russell Crow did an equally great job acting. The story was touching. John Nash (Russell Crow), ironically enough, was incredibly brilliant, but he also suffered from hallucinations. He was stuck in a difficult quandary: he could take his medication which would suppress his illness and effectively erase his identity, which was his brilliant mind. Or, he could refuse his medication and keep his superiorly sharp mind, but also risk his sanity. Just being afflicted with the illness and having to succumb to it would have been a story in itself, but Nash actually living with the illness without taking inhibitors made his story that much more spectacular. He made a daring bold move to deal with his condition without the aide of his medication so that he wouldn't be without what made him -him. In fact, he proved what a powerful mind he had to deal with the hallucinations and still continue to operate normally. This was truly a wonderful story about a beautiful mind.",

I will not reveal a lot of the plot... and I urge you, if you do not know much about Nash or what happens in this, *please* do what you can to keep it that way until you have seen this. What I will say is that the protagonist here is a mathematical genius. The acting is simply astonishing. I would list the superb performers, but I'd wind up including everyone. They are simply flawless. Two that must not go unmentioned are Russell and Connelly, both of whom deliver a powerful and unforgettable portrayal of their respective roles. The characters are well-written and credible. This is impeccably well-written and psychologically accurate. The plot is interesting and develops marvelously throughout. I could not take my eyes off this for a single moment at any point. The pacing is spot-on.

If you are not certain what I am referring to after a viewing, feel free to contact me and I will tell you. The music is excellent and fitting. This has incredible production values, and deserves every award it won. There is some rather disturbing content, a little violence and occasional, moderately strong language.

Also the story hits close to home for me because my grandfather who was an inventor and electrical engineer also was battling schizophrenia before he passed away. The realism that Russel Crow portrayed in the moments when he wasn't quite clear and also how he was later able to get control over his beautiful mind really was well done and shows the amount of research that he must have done for the part.

Alicia becomes concerned for John though and calls Dr. Rosen (Christopher Plummer) to have a talk with him, and that is when we the audience, and soon John himself, realises he has paranoid schizophrenia. So John knows that Parcher, his university roommate Charles Herman (Paul Bettany) and his niece are all unreal people who only he can see, and he really struggles to get on with them in his life, causing terrible distress for Alicia. As the years go by he has learnt to ignore them, he returns to Princeton, and his academic success wins him the Nobel Prize for economics. Also starring Adam Goldberg as Sol, Judd Hirsch as Helinger, Josh Lucas as Hansen, Anthony Rapp as Bender and Austin Pendleton as Thomas King. Crowe does very well as the lead character, Connelly of course steals the show with her award-winning performance, and the support of Harris and Bettany are good, it is a film that desires people to take it seriously, but still very worthwhile. It won the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Editing, Best Makeup, Best Music, Original Score for James Horner, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Screenplay, and Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score. Russell Crowe was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Paul Bettany was number 40 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and the film was number 93 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Good!",

In part, I think its popularity helped it to win an Oscar, and it's an over-rated film in my opinion. (I don't think this film deserved an Oscar because there were equally good or better films produced that year.) It's good, but I've seen better. It was almost there, but it just didn't make it in my category of top films. Cinematography was probably the best single thing about the film. Average and over-rated.",

No. Look at the sort of films that do well on the big night! This film is like Chocolat - sugary sweet. Let's just hope for the sake of cinema that the Academy sees sense like it did with that. The film is historically completely inaccurate. But the serious crime is that schizophrenia is badly misrepresented. Rather than audi-intrusiveness in some schizophrenics, the film producers decided to opt for sixth-sense style sensationalism. How original. Nash's violent temper and bi-sexuality were almost completely disregarded, or sanitised, and the ending was puke-makingly sugary. The film has one, and only one, redeeming feature: Crowe has done it again. For all his odiousness as a person, he has managed a fine performance.

Yet this is the kind of performance people often fall for, giving credit to the role's challenges than to the actual connection we have to the actor.

Superior direction from Howard combined with Russell's talent made it an Oscar favorite. The film does leave out several periods in his life story but I found that those additions only would have served to detract from the masterpiece instead of make it smoother or more ""factual"". This is a story about life, love, sickness, and genius. It is also a story of a triumph of the human spirit. The spirit urges us forward when the mind fails and the heart is not willing.

The license the film maker takes to entertain us leaves many truths of this story stretched far beyond the reasonable.  It troubles me that a serious film maker would make such flaws as are made with issues relating to facts that are easily verifiable.  For example, lectures are given prior to the awarding of a Nobel Prize, and acceptance speeches are never given.

Nash's story is an engaging one and he's certainly an interesting figure, tragic in many respects; Russell Crowe's casting is miles away from the macho persona he's best known for but he's surprisingly sensitive in the part.

Nash has been homogenized for the public gastro-intestinal tract and spewed forth by Crowe, a feat which is sure to be the nader of his acting career.  He is paradoxically terminally bland and oppressively obnoxious.  His wife's role played by Connelly is harmless and sincere I think, she is miscast (certainly not given the same depth as in _Requiem for a Dream_) and not to be blamed.  Harris has always performed better.",

The film does a great job of exploring every single aspect of John Nash's mind and when we finally see him for who he truly is, my heart breaks. A heartbreaking film that becomes almost unbearable to watch as Nash combats with his own mind between what he knows is right and what his mind tells him is real. The fact that he had such a beautiful gift for codebreaking but along with it came an unimaginable curse is terrifying. I believe it's impossible to understand what possibly could go through John Nash's head on a daily basis, and the experiences he had to endure throughout his life really are unimaginable but this film does a flawless job of bringing us as close to understanding him as possible. A big help in creating it's brilliance are the phenomenal performances from Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly which are two of the best of their career (probably is the best of Jennifer's), the decade and, I dare-say, of all time.

The excessive time devoted to the unfolding of the relatively simple story makes a mockery of the otherwise fine efforts of the actors, and make them look overdramatised and pretentious.

Though this film is largely vapid, trite, and completely fails to delve into John Nash's psyche at all, it presents the illusion of a strong character study.  The beautiful cinematography, musical score, and close-ups all work to create, like a formula, the illusion of feeling.  The audience sees (close-up + sad music + frustrated Russel Crowe = sad reaction).  Ron Howard provided the audience with all of the trappings they expect to see in an Oscar-calibre film and most moviegoing audiences have been trained to believe that slow-motion and nice cinematogrgraphy are the elements that make a good film.  Yet, this film completely lacks the kind of character development and true inner conflict that thrives in a film like Monster's Ball.  It is a veneer and never even attempts to get below the surface.  Ron Howard went fishing for an Oscar and got two.  The fact that Howard won an Oscar is embarrasing.

Ron Howard seems to be peaking as a movie maker. Still though, he continues to get caught up in melodrama, but much less so in this fine film.  Mumbling Russell Crowe is outstanding (again) as the brilliant, but haunted Dr. John Nash.  Jennifer Connelly stands toe-to-toe with Crowe in every scene.  If you are unfamiliar with Connelly's work, check out ""The Hot Spot"".  It's a sleeper with Don Johnson and Virginia Madsen.  WOW!  As usual, Ron Howard has produced a few interesting notes. He has regular appearance of family members, including veteran actor dad, Rance.  Also, note the brief appearance of super-casting director (more than 100 films) of Jane Jenkins.  Regular film-goers will easily recognize her name.  This movie is not your typical bio pic.  This movie is about mental illness and both Nash's brave attempt to fight the disease with as little medication as possible.  This film makes a statement that disease is often too quickly treated with pills and not compassion, support and grit. Wonderful supporting roles by Christopher Plummer and the under-utilized Judd Hirsch make this a truly masterful picture.  Some of Ed Harris's scenes were overblown, but probably had to be to make the point they were making. Very few light moments in this one, but a must see.",

A Beautiful Mind is a movie based on a real person but the film changed him and his wife and no one seemed to mind. Denzel Washington played Hurricane Carter in his film, The Hurricane, and the film was blasted by critics because the screen writer had to take some ""creative liberties"" in telling the story. Murder in the First, the story based on Henri Young's prison time at Alcatraz was also lamblasted because of ""creative libertes."" Murder in the First did poorly at the box office because of certain film critics let it be known that it took such liberities. Yet these same critics shouted Hosannas over A Beautiful Mind deliberately over looking the ""facts"" that the main character was homosexual and that his wife was a Spanish woman. And to add insult to injury, the actress playing his wife won an Academy Award. Several Spanish actresses commented that how little roles came their way and that this role would have been just what was needed. Sure, some readers will probably say ""so, what.""! it was the story that counted. And that would be true except that it was not the real story about the genius. What with Ron Howard one would expect nothing less than him changing the wife to a white woman. All in all, A Beautiful Mind might have been an Academy Award picture but it's pure fraud.

I always think that the terrible movies are the most fun to review, because there's nothing better than slashing a movie like Scary Movie or Coyote Ugly that is obviously a belligerent mess, but it is the great films that allow for the presentation of some meaning in a review, and A Beautiful Mind presents a unique set of challenges in reviewing a great film. One way to begin to look at this film is to simply try to list the vast number of ways in which the film illuminates different elements of the human condition. There are the obvious ones, such as the problems associated with mental illness, as well as the fact that people who suffer from mental illness can be considered nothing other than victims, but are still all too often frightened and hurt by their treatment, but then there are less obvious ones, such as the fact that people truly are a product of their environment, and in the case of John Nash, that very environment lashes out at him when it is not processed correctly in his head.

His mind off elsewhere, Nash doesn't even listen to the inspirational introductory speech, but is instead  most likely  contemplating the original mathematical theory that he believes will make him great. Of course, he hasn't formulated this theory yet, but he is so supremely confident of his brilliance that, for him, it is inevitable.",

228,2 January 2002,meeza,10, Simply Gorgeous!,"It was sure a happy day when I decided to see Director Ron Howard's new film `A Beautiful Mind'. This film is one that sure looks good to be one of the best of the year. The film stars Russell Crowe, and it is based on the real life story of John Nash. Nash is an ingenious mathematician who has had to battle with schizophrenia. Crowe's performance should equal another Best Actor Oscar nomination. His work was so good that I would not be surprised if he adds another oscar to his acting awards collection.  If you multiply Crowe's work by the very effective supporting performances by Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, and Christopher Plummer it will not be odd to say that this is the best ensemble acting in film this year; even though I am also divided by the fine ensemble acting of `Memento', `Mulholland Drive' and `Sidewalks of New York'.  Director Ron Howard should also receive a Best Director Oscar nomination, and any academy members who disagrees with his nomination should be subtracted from the board. What all this adds up to is that `A Beautiful Mind' is a beautiful classic that you should not miss! ***** Excellent",

We only have to look at the scarce filmography that deals with the life and work of great personalities of any science to discover how difficult it is to strengthen the ties between the common public and the distant (but fascinating) scientific world. Those who gained cinematic notoriety did not achieve it only for their genius and their scientific contribution to humanity. Stephen Hawking has won at least two biopics - driven largely by the fame he gained as a genius who overcame the physical devastation wrought by his illness. Other personalities from the scientific and technological world already had their media appeal well established before their stories were taken to the big screen.

241,11 May 2014,VinayNair,9, Beautifully made,"At first glance, A Beautiful Mind is an inspiring tale about a ""genius"" mathematician who struggles with severe mental problems. And as long as we can focus on that first glance, the film provides compelling entertainment. I found myself caught up in the movie. Director Ron Howard (Splash, Parenthood) delivers an intriguing story about a man struggling to maintain clarity as his prodigious powers of imagination bring him inspiration, delusion, true love, and trouble. How rare is this? A film out of Hollywood in which the hero's most heroic endeavour involves restraint and self control! But A Beautiful Mind presents itself as the true story of John Nash, whose mathematical breakthroughs have apparently changed the world. And there's the rub. I came away from A Beautiful Mind feeling inspired to learn more about this fascinating character. And the farther I moved from the movie, the more I began to see it for what it is: a fantasy, at best and at worst, a rip-off game by con-artist. Strong accusations? I suppose so. And for the record, I don't expect films that are ""based on a true story"" to be 100% factual. It's impossible to tell a story that is entirely true to its inspiration; we all invent fictions in order to convey aspects of the truth that are most important to us. But shouldn't movies that claim to be ""based on actual events"" seek to bear some resemblance to those ""actual events""? Is it too much to ask that the film makers and storytellers be reasonable in their embellishments? Watching this film, we endure the hardship of John Nash's mental problems right alongside him. Howard, who has proved time and time again that he can build a decent, workmanlike motion picture does his typically adequate job of telling the story. And the great Russell Crowe brings a lot to the production. Crowe, who deserved an Oscar for his work in The Insider (but received one for Gladiator instead, alas!) is fantastic. He transforms himself into this staggering, bewildered, tormented soul. In spite of a bland script, he gives us glimpses of a hurting spirit, an alienated boy, incapable of discerning the difference between fantasy and reality. It's hard to watch. As we watch Nash grow old, Crowe's performance and make up (some of the finest ageing make up I have ever seen) deliver a completely convincing human being burdened with challenges most of us have never imagined. Nash is a character who isn't comfortable with what we consider ""normal life."" In social circles, he's brusque and rude. Around women, he's awkward and downright insulting. At work, he ridicules the ""great ideas"" of his genius peers, calling their work ""derivative"" and declaring, ""There's not an original or innovative idea in any of it."" Nash's troubles stem from schizophrenic hallucinations, and A Beautiful Mind is the story of his struggle to reject false realities and hold fast to what is true. But he is calm, collected, and right at home whenever he's breaking codes and solving mathematical problems. We can see the potential in him, and so, in spite of his unkindness, we find Nash sympathetic. We root for him when he is drawn into working for a harsh and manipulative government operative (Ed Harris.) And we also root for him to overcome his social awkwardness when an admiring student (the radiant Jennifer Connelly) starts courting him. As a result, A Beautiful Mind stands apart from most Hollywood hero epics, in which we are told again and again to obey our hearts and our impulses. This story dares to suggest that the path to fulfilment and peace requires that we deny of self-destructive impulses. This is the most resonant chord in the film's dissonant symphony. At its heart, A Beautiful Mind is a parable about self-control, and about becoming a better person through the transforming of our minds.It's a shame, then, that the movie contradicts itself.For the sake of crowd pleasing, Howard abandons the thought of restraint when Nash is tempted into romance by a student named Alicia. The allure of a glamorous romance gets the better of him, and their plunge into passion is portrayed without any question about the propriety of such behaviour. Further, we are baited into cheering when Nash lashes out at those around him, because it makes for good spectacle.",

Well, after finally watching this film, my opinions were altered completely.  I'm sure if Russell Crowe didn't start any emotional outbursts, he would've certainly won for Best Actor.  I love Denzel Washington, and he was great in ""Training Day,"" but he played a ruthless villain and his role didn't have many dimensions.  As Richard Roeper said, Denzel had the opportunity to ham it up a little.

Of course once Hollywood gets its hands on anyone's story true-life details are changed, things are jazzed up to make things seem more dramatic than they actually were. In A Beautiful Mind though the Hollywood treatment works and is actually quite understandable. In order for his film to succeed director Ron Howard had to somehow take us inside the mind of the schizophrenic John Nash. Howard pulls this off brilliantly and that more than anything else is what enables the film to succeed. It's not the entirely true story of John Nash's life but it's close enough. And the story that is presented here is undeniably compelling, dramatic and entertaining. It was a very challenging story to tell and Howard, helped no doubt by his stellar cast, pulls it off wonderfully. A Beautiful Mind is a rousing success.",

It begins by showing his days as a student at Princeton, where he searches for a completely original idea, something that will earn him widespread recognition. This goes on for about the first 25 minutes, and it is positively brilliant. But then, something happens. The next 20 or so minutes are extremely predictable and dull, as if it came straight out of a spy novel. This is my fault, though, because I find out as little as possible about a movie before seeing it. Had I tried finding out a little more about A Beautiful Mind, I would've surely seen the reason for this. Long story short, I wasn't expecting the major plot twist that came around the hour mark of the film, and that just blew me away. That dull 20 minutes is something I appreciated only when viewing the segment again, this time with the knowledge of why it seemed so dull. ",

Fidgety mannerisms are not pleasant to watch and they grow in number as the malady takes hold. Imagined presence of colleagues at the University where he teaches mathematics and imagined conversations with them suggest that his brain is playing tricks with him.

The man who Crowe plays is Professor John Nash a mathematician whose cryptology problems have dealt with economics and other things, but there is one thing that makes us feel bad for Nash and that is that he suffers from a disorder called schizophrenia a disorder where you see things that aren't visible but seen in his imagination. Howard uses an excellent cast Besides Crowe (in a performance that should've won an Oscar) but the film also has Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, Judd Hirsch, and Josh Lucas, but it is Harris and Bettany who play as his delusions. This was really one of the most powerful dramas I have ever seen with Russell Crowe giving a virtuoso performance. This is in some people's lists as one of the worst best picture winners of all time and that the first Lord of the Rings movie should have won, but from my perspective there was something behind it that I think that it should have won best picture and that is that how powerful it was. There was other things that were good about the film besides the direction by Ron Howard, and the excellent performances, but the other things were, the magnificent cinematography by the great Roger Deakins, the score by James Horner, and last but not least the makeup and costumes.

Academy voters out there reading this review, listen up! You unfairly snubbed Howard of a Best Director Oscar nomination 6 years ago for his brilliant ""Apollo 13"", and if you decide to snub him of a Best Director nomination this year for ""A Beautiful Mind"", you will be sorry. Howard should be nominated for his directing job on this film because he did a great job. Let me say that again. A GREAT JOB! The film should also get a nod for Best Picture too. It's one of the very best movies of 2001. ""A Beautiful Mind"" tells the true story of John Forbes Nash Jr., a man who is one of the world's greatest mathematicians, and a victim of schizophrenia. From undergraduate days at Princeton to his winning of the Nobel Prize, we follow Nash on a journey that takes him into the far reaches of mathematical discovery, and into a bewildering labyrinth of hallucinations and madness. Russell Crowe brilliantly portrays Nash in what I think is the best performance of his career. He's sure to win another Oscar nomination this year (we'll see if he can duplicate what Tom Hanks did several years ago and that is win back-to-back Best Actor Oscars; Crowe has a very good chance of doing that). A great supporting performance is turned in by Jennifer Connelly as Nash's wife Alicia; she'll get a Best Supporting Actress nomination. These two key performances by Crowe and Connelly make ""A Beautiful Mind"" the great film it is thanks primarily to Howard's direction and Akiva Goldsmith's wonderful screenplay (based on Sylvia Nasar's book). ""A Beautiful Mind"" might give ""Lord of the Rings"" a run for the Oscars come this March. It's a great movie. ",

The life portrayed is no doubt interesting, but there is a Hollywood tendency to latch too much on the other aspects of a film in order to draw in the less focussed viewer. Russell Crowe does his bit to rescue this production as the star, and Connelly, Harris and Bettany are also excellent, but their scripts allow only so much scope for personal talent to shine. It is also worth noting that this movie is so late 90s/early 00s in its style that its slightly laughable at points. There is a soft light filter over the entire film, and the music is dramatic to say the least. The origin of the story is good-natured (and Crowe does do an excellent job as Nash), but by the end, I wondered what the real Nash would have thought of his life story's trivialisation.",

In many cases, the boundaries between them are not very clear, and schizophrenia like ""a beautiful eve"" is in most cases the patent of a person with a high IQ. Movies need dramatic contradictions and conflicts, and a contradictory personality is undoubtedly a good material. For a long time, both movies and TV shows have created a series of similar images to satisfy the audience's voyeuristic desire for the group of highly intelligent businessmen.

It was confusing at first, because I couldn't tell whether Ed Harris's character or the others were real or not and if the world that he was living in was a fake, just like the Truman show. However, it is a true story and the world that he lived in was real enough. Russell Crowe gives his best performance ever, even better than Gladiator. You can see his emotions and his fight to overcome those struggles. Ed Harris and everyone else do a great job with their roles.

The direction was totally manipulative.  Only the acting, (which was still a bit of the showy ""give me an Oscar"" variety by Crow) kept me with this film.

By this I don't mean to Underestimate his good job in the movie but I guess many other awards agree with me that he did a good job but didn't do his best only the Oscars that refused to give it to Peter Jackson. The story too didn't focus on his smart and the people around him more than it focused on his problem and tragedy that I felt he was a genius person his tragedy prevented him from using his mind and his family suffered to make him better.

376,3 June 2004,CurtMan@LVCM.com,10, Beautiful EVERYTHING in this beautiful film,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""A Beautiful Mind"" ranks as one of the best films I have ever had the privilege to understand, a monumental achievement on multiple levels in film. To begin with, the performance of Russell Crowe as the troubled, delusional mathematician John Nash borders on sheer perfection- astute, collaborative (of Nash's estrangement with the world), and potent; Crowe constructs a character so veritable and bewildering that you always marvel his genius and symphathize with his illness. The film chronicles a brilliant, yet socially flawed, mathematician. Nash dissociates with the world, dismissing the company of others for sketching and calculating curious situational equations----on his dormatory window. Struggling with ""books, classes"", Nash finally emerges as a gifted mathematician with a law for governing dynamics, and succeeds from Princton to Wheeler Labs at M.I.T. Assigned by ""Big Brother"" to investigate potential communist coding in various publications, Nash is soon propelled into a dizzying world of fright, turmoil, and delusion, as his accomplished genius is almost obliterated by mental illness. The film focuses intensely on Nash's battle with schizophrenia, with brilliant direction, beautiful music, and potent,engrossing dialogue. The second standout performance here is the beautiful Jennifer Connelly, who compassionately plays Nash's wife, Alicia, supporting the film whenever we lack to understand Nash and his trauma. The film succeeds in its story of a mathematician plagued by schizophrenia with realism and empathy. Every instrument of constructing this story is suitable, if not excellent. Simply put, ""A Beautiful Mind"" delivers the most beautiful potency in its success of engrossing us with John Nash, the most important genius of his time, and detailing his truly, bizarrely, remarkable life. **** out of ****",
377,14 March 2014,Gedaliav,9, Nash the man behind A Beautiful Mind,"John Nash arrives at Princeton University because of the prestigious Carnegie Scholarship for mathematics. Nash comes under increasing pressure to publish, but he refuses until he finds a truly original idea. His inspiration comes when he and his fellow graduate students discuss how to approach a group of women at a bar. Hansen quotes Adam Smith and advocates ""every man for himself"", but Nash argues that a cooperative approach would lead to better chances of success. This leads to a new concept of governing dynamics which Nash develops and publishes. On the strength of this he is offered an appointment at MIT where Sol and Bender join him. He considers his regular duties at MIT uninteresting and beneath his talents, so he is pleased to be given a new assignment by mysterious supervisor, William Parcher of the United States Department of Defense, to look for patterns in magazines and newspapers in order to thwart a Soviet plot. Nash becomes increasingly obsessive about searching for these hidden patterns. He meets Alicia and marries while working at the US Department. Throughout this time he develops his schizophrenia and imagines people created by his mind. Alicia finds out that Nash has schizophrenia and that Charles, Marcee and Parcher exist only in his imagination. Alicia investigates and finally confronts Nash.",

I had possibly avoided it because of the subject matter, in that, whilst not being scizophrenic, I have endured my own mental problems in my time. The Oscar ceremony persuaded me to see what all the fuss was about. I am so glad that I made that decision. I am very relieved it beat the likes of 'Moulin Rouge' and 'The Lord of the Rings' for, although I thought that both of those films were good, neither deserved to be considered as 'best film'. Personally, 'Amelie' was my favourite film of the year, but 'A Beautiful Mind' has to be the best film. I was quite shocked by the depth of Russell Crowe's talent. It's a shame he won the Oscar last year - I thought Tom Hanks should have won for 'Castaway'. Had he not done so, I'm sure he would have scooped the award this year. I've not seen 'Training Day' but this role demanded acting on many different levels. Crowe dominates the film with his performance; the perfect contrast of the brains versus the brawn of 'Gladiator'. Actually, if anything, I think his menacing thug-cop in 'LA Confidential' was a better performance than in 'Gladiator'. Anyway, apart from Crowe, I cannot fathom why Jennifer Connely did not win a Best Actress Oscar. Is there a screen time presence rule? If not, I feel she should have won in that category. I haven't previously particularly liked Ron Howard films, and I thought 'The Grinch' was pretty dire, but his direction is perfect here.

It's an outstanding cinematic work which tells well the true story of the incomparably brilliant mathematician John Nash, a schizophrenic who leads a very traumatic life, due to the fact that overusing his beautiful mind leads to such a frightening life. I am impressed with the depiction of the story which goes all the way from 1947 through 1994 when Nash received the Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics. The versatile Russell Crowe came across well in the character depiction of the overtaxed scientist who refused to take his medicine for his degenerative disease. Ed Harris convinced people that they should hate him for the harm he brought to Nash, even if he was a phantasm. Christopher Plummer was very good as the caring doctor, Dr. Rosen. Jennifer Connelley (my favorite) played her part well as the very concerned and very loving wife. Vivien Cardone, whose age was only in the single-digit column when the movie was produced, was outstanding as the little girl Marcee Herman who was taken with him; the character Marcee herself was a phantasm. Paul Bettany was excellent as the practically-vicious Charles, Nash's roommate; Charles himself was a phantasm. The only thing that family members should have been concerned about were the graphic and scary scenes, such as Nash's shock treatment and his cutting himself on the wrist. But overall, it was an excellent production. It was another great feat for producer Ron Howard, and, of course, for Universal, Dreamworks, and Imagine Productions.

He is eventually recruited, in secret, by the government, to break codes involving an atomic bomb hidden somewhere in Europe. Soon after, things take a psychological twist, leaving John to wonder what's real, and what's not.

For a short while after having watched this film I developed a fascination for John Nash. Latter I heard him interviewed on NPR and was thrilled by both his brilliance and humor. That interview only made the movie even more dear to me, bringing home once again the reality of it all. The only movies I can think of to compare with ""A Beautiful Mind"" are Cassasblanca and The Wizard of Oz. Oh, I understand that the three have nothing in common as per plot, setting, etc. But they have THIS in common ... They are cinematic art at its finest. Thats what ""A Beautiful Mind"" is.

Think about its premise: the story of the co-recipient of the Nobel prize for economics in 1994, a mathematical genius who was nearly overlooked because he was a paranoid schizophrenic. There is no doubt that Ron Howard and Russell Crowe's involvement was crucial to the film's coming to pass, but before one frame was shot, someone had to say ""yes.""

So Ron Howard decides to put the focus of the story squarely on our protagonist and his mental demise and subsequent rise again. But it's just not that interesting. Sorry. I was bored by the time the credits came up. Russell Crowe is a fine actor but the story was limp and I was bored. Some movie fans are such suckers when it comes to displays of intense emotion.

412,14 March 2002,teejayniles2345,10," Why ""MIND"" will win the TOP OSCAR March 24","The 2001 Ron Howard film, A BEAUTIFUL MIND, is more than a front runner in the race for a Best Picture Academy Award.  It's the most traditional, logical, and emotional Best Picture among the major feature-length films vying in the category for that Hollywood ""gold medal"" triumph.  This significant ""team product"" (Universal Studios, DreamWorks, and Imagine Entertainment) deserves the endorsement that only the top Oscar can convey! As a ""traditional"" pick, consider how this 2 1/2 hour film advances an invigorating ""happy ending"" format.  The episodic chronicle of a mentally challenged individual, John Nash, and his long-suffering, supportive wife, Sylvia, neither ends with gloom nor doom.  Some might object that such recent winners as AMADEUS and THE ENGLISH PATIENT ended with death by overwork, plane crashes, and euthanasia; however, their popular source material from novel or stage play dictated the outcome of their main characters, respectively.  The typical American outlook is one of victory despite obstacles of all sorts.  This winning depiction of a delusional schizophreniac even includes his Acceptance Speech at the Nobel Prize ceremonies in 1994.  Like memorable and typical Hollywood biographies, this film offers basically glimpses of an overall success story.  The Nash family remains held together despite extreme medical and psychiatric crises. Opponents of this film's sweep onto the 3/24 Victory Stand/Stage in Hollywood point out that the depicted couple actually divorced and separated, only later reconciling.  Tradition favors memories of an uncomplicated nature and this film has an ""uneasy"" connection to what's real and what's not real at all.  If it wins because of its comforting attitude, voters may sweep along to Best Actor and Best Director awards Russell Crowe and Ron Howard as they did when RAIN MAN, Dustin Hoffman, and Barry Levinson took home Oscars. Secondly, A BEAUTIFUL MIND is the most logical pick out of the primary competition (GOSFORD PARK, MOULIN ROUGE, and THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING).  The Academy will likely be supportive of American-focused material for this first ceremony after the national tragedy of September 11, 2001; they'd perhaps promote the New Jersey-set film over those set in England and Paris (GOSFORD & MOULIN ROUGE).  Other films with minor nominations have settings in the U.S.: MEMENTO, ALI, MONSTER'S BALL, and TRAINING DAY;  I predict that some of these will spoil the races in several of the categories with their strongest performances or technical accomplishments.  Voters of the Academy logically might be holding off any recognition of the first-of-three installments of THE LORD OF THE RINGS saga.  Two more films will debut at Christmas 2002 and 2003.  Like STAR WARS, STAR TREK, and INDIANA JONES, they might win at the box office while never taking home the Best Picture statuette. Thirdly, A BEAUTIFUL MIND packs an emotional wallop but yet doesn't fully flatten its audience.  When I recently viewed certain of its most gripping sequences (in Nash's padded room or insulin therapy lab and in the small family bathroom), I was amazed at the overwhelmingly effective nature of the film's depiction of the ravages of mental illness.  There was so much raw power on the screen; still, we cared about all the individuals involved without losing our connection to the story and its graphically depicted extremes.  To contrast, the independently produced nominee, IN THE BEDROOM, took its audience on a roller-coaster ride that did ""hit the solar plexus."" Its pure realism about modern-day violence, from a short story by Andre Dubus deserved full recognition in this mega-category.  Its chance to play ""David"" among the other ""Goliaths"" is hard to predict, at least right now. Older voters, a majority of Academy members, would favor some emotion without feeling immobilized and stunned senseless by it, in my opinion. In conclusion, A BEAUTIFUL MIND deserves the highest award on March 24 because of its conventional approach to an American success story, its logical preference to a ""Middle-Earth"" fantasy epic, and its emotional punch that moves us to terrain where we can catch our breath without wheezing in dire pain.  When all is said and done, this Ron Howard-Brian Grazer production may not win all of its nominations but it stands the greatest chance of taking home the ""gold"" -- the Oscar for Best Picture 2001.",

Russell Crowe gives the standout performance of the year as well as his career in the part of John Nash. He simply goes from one great role to another and yet he makes the job look so effortless. Ron Howard has made yet another enjoyable film... I've yet to see him make a bad one. Jennifer Connelly is Nash's steadfast wife who defies all the conventional rules and stands by her husband as he fights a nightmarish battle against schizophrenia. She gives a good performance but I don't think it's Oscar material. It's basically like Gwenyth Paltrow's popularity campaign a few years ago for ""Shakespeare in Love"".

But, what I really want to point out is what I consider one of the most brilliant examples of slight of hand in a movie that I have ever seen.  **** minor spoiler alert ****  It is sad that we have become conditioned to stupidity in film making.  Nuclear weapons can accidentally detonate, guns never seem to run out of ammunition, the CIA can do anything, etc.  When Ron Howard presented me with a cold-war code breaking scenario involving a German nuclear bomb, I knew it was nonsense and fully accepted that something so dumb could be put into a movie by an otherwise savvy director. Of course, it turns out to not exist.  This trick very much impressed me. It showed that Ron Howard is aware that we are conditioned to stupidity and was willing to use that against us, thereby exploiting a weakness in the viewer that expands the range of illusion.  Later, he tricks us again when we realize that the illusions are not always so well telegraphed.  If was this element of A Beautiful Mind that most impressed me.

For me, it was also a revelation in terms of Russell Crowe as an actor. I had admired his playing in 'Gladiator' and thought he was good fun to watch in 'Master and Commander' (while, on the other hand, I had thought his 'Robein Hood' was a disaster and a waste of talent all round - not least for including the usually marvellous Cate Blanchett in its proceedings as well!) In this film, though, Crowe is a revelation and shows some of the best movie screen acting I have ever witnessed.

This film also drills home the point that some of the best minds of our time are sometimes a little crazy.  Also, that behind every great man, there is a great woman (or vice versa).  This film shows that.  The ending would never have happened, it is not likely that Nash would have made it without his wife.  The only thing I did not like about is the way it was presented.

With Jennifer Connelly as his wife Alicia and Paul Bettany as his roommate Charles, this film sets up to be a great film about the success of a gifted person. Unfortunately that is not how things progressed. John Nash's mind leads him down a self-destructive path that neither friends or family can save him from. With espionage and government intervention around every corner it is impossible to know which way to turn. Ed Harris is excellent as Parcher, the dark government agent who, it seems, hires Nash to work at a secret government facility to help decode vital information.

The biggest problem of the movie is that Crowe portrays Nash probably far more likable than Nash actually was durng his illness. Crowe has a charisma that the real Nash probably does not have. The movie is a Hollywood movie. It is glitzy and stylish. However, I think Howard has done an admirable job in storytelling. Crowe portrayed Nash well. Nash was althletic looking and handsome when he was younger. Howard had synthesize the whole story in a couple hours and I think he told the story in a very powerful way. Schizophrenics are delusional partly because their view of the universe makes them the center of the universe. Their role in their universe is very important to them. The movie also reveals the torment of the treatment and the drugs they used back then to treat schizophrenia. Connelly was beautiful and very convincing as the wife. I enjoyed the movie immensely.

The kind that do well at the Oscars, like 'Gandhi' or 'Forrest Gump'. Russell Crowe plays John Nash, a brilliant mathematician who developes schizophrenia and loses touch with reality. He deals with his illness with the help of his wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly). Fashionable cynicism aside, it is a wonderful story, because it's true. Of course some of the nastier things Nash did when he was nuts - like slag Jews - are ignored for the sake of a tighter script and a more appealing hero. This is an example of why the movie is good but not great - director Ron Howard ('Apollo 13', Richie in 'Happy Days') can't quite trust the story. He has to overplay his hand, showing Alicia's nobility and Nash's courage a little heavy-handedly, letting the music soar a bit too much, in short making a Hollywood movie. It's not that 'A Beautiful Mind' is sickening or earnest - there's a surprising amount of laugh-out-loud moments relating to Nash's delusions and some gripping scenes - but there is enough schlock to keep it from being really outstanding.

Nowadays, however, based on is a fairly loose term.  The sheer number of factual errors and liberties taken with the life of the schizophrenic mathematician are too many to count, so perhaps it is best to think of this film as a fiction.  That said, this otherwise mediocre movie is elevated to an extreme degree by Russell Crowe's brilliant performance. As John Nash, Crowe is nothing short of astounding.  He single handedly redeems the film, and raises it past the level of mediocrity.  In truth, this film won four academy awards it should not have (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actress), and lost the one award for which it should have been a shoo-in (Best Actor).  Is there no justice?",
479,26 May 2002,jaesboxer,8, Russell Crowe's performance is nothing short of marvelous,"I must admit, I went into A Beautiful Mind not expecting much.  It had received lukewarm reviews and I, at the time, was not really in the mood for another feel good triumph of the human spirit movie.  But I came out most pleasantly suprised. For the past little while, I've had a love-hate relationship with this movie.  I liked it, and thought it a very mature film by Ron Howard, yet I feel it was a sycophantic attemtpt to draw attention at the academy awards, attention that I feel should have rightly gone to The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring. Now, to say off the bat, Russell Crowe's performance is nothing short of marvelous.  I don't particularly care for him, but I can certainly respect his brilliant portrayal of the schizophrenic mathematician John Forbes Nash, Jr.  While Howard glosses over the more displeasing character traits of Nash a la The Hurricane, traits which include alleged Anti-Semitism, it's not his movie.  Crowe owns the screen, and, being in virtually every scene, he elevates what could have been a tale of a man's struggle with a severe mental illness he can't deal with, and the people that stuck with him, into something that, while not approaching art, is heart-wrenching, with a predictable, but nonetheless welcomed happy ending.  I find it difficult to understand how this film earned Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay, yet failed to garner one for the man who made the effort worthwhile.  Yet, Hollywood loves mental illness.  From Forrest Gump, to Rain Man, to Charly, films about heart over mind seem to never get old with the judges at the Oscars. I feel that this is as good a film as could have been made about this character, almost entirely due to Crowe, without becoming distant to the viewer.  Do we really want to know about Nash's Anti-Semitism?  Not really, no.  A Beautiful Mind will always appear to me a film that made a campaign at the academy awards, and robbed a far superior film of it's honor.  But it's definitely worth seeing.",

A Beautiful Mind was definitely the best film of 2001. Russell Crowe was just brilliant. Even though I was rooting for Denzel Washington at the Oscars, I would not have been surprised at all if Russell Crowe ended up with the Best Actor.  His performance was exceptional.  Most of us would not have seen the real John Nash before this, but if Crowe's acting was anything to go by, I think that's exactly how he must have been. His dialogue delivery and expressions were wonderful.  I believe that the entire movie rested on his shoulders and he did a splendid job.

Nash's story IS compelling; however, Ron Howard (director) misses every opportunity to tell it or interpret it. Again and again, he resorts to safe, traditional, manipulative, Hollywood direction and refuses to enter Nash's mind and relay his experience in a visual or metaphorical way (refer to Aronofsky's brilliant ""Pi"").  We are instead given car chases, conspiracy theories, imaginary friends, sentimental scenes with fountain pens, but alas, no interesting camera work. That's a pity.  Roger Deakins' cinematography (with the Coen Brothers, for instance) is usually astonishing. Here, it's merely serviceable.  Howard reigned Deakins in for all the wrong reasons.  Lastly, the Academy of Blah, Blah, Blah is just as predictable, misty-eyed and conservative as it has always been.  A Beautiful Mind was certainly not the best picture of last year.",

511,6 February 2002,stevenleadbetter,9," Well, I liked it, regardless.","OK, the problem with a recreation of either a story that has been filmed before, written down in ink or happened in actuality, is that the retelling is never accurate. OK, so John Nash may well have been portayed as more of a saint than is actual. But I take umbrage at those that comment that this is a lesser film for it's license to bend the facts. As a biography of a nobel prize winners life, it doesn't stand up to much close scrutiny, but as a piece of cinematic entertainment it is as fine a piece of cinema as I have seen all year. I am continually surprised by Russell Crowe's acting abilities. I was reminded of 'The Insider' almost straight away, in that 'little man, fighting against the odds' kind of way.",

I had no intention of watching it again because I didn't see what the big fuss was, except for Jennifer Connely. But after a while I decided to watch the whole movie all the way through. This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. Jennifer Connely and Russell Crowe turn in some truly outstanding performances.

518,9 February 2002,jack_94706,8," A fine movie; a ""detailed"" book","Enjoyed reading many other reviewer's comments, especially those who'd experienced schizophrenia themselves or who'd worked as psychiatrists and the like. I've had some acquaintance on a personal level with friends and family who've experienced mental illness -- both bi-polar illness (usually called mania or manic-depressive illness) and schizophrenia. After first seeing the movie and then reading Sylvia Nasar's book, I have very mixed emotions about both. The main ""true"" thing which comes through in either version -- is that schizophrenics do sometimes recover, or experience long periods of ""remission"" as the book describes it. Central to this, many times, is the support of family and recognition of professional colleagues. In Nash's case, many many colleagues were exceptionally tolerant and caring -- something more underscored in the book. The movie makes Nash's wife the main hero, plain and simple, in his recovery. The books paints a much more varied and full-bodied story of life with his wife, his mistress, his sons (one by his wife, one by his mistress) -- and of his homosexual liaisons which were also key to his life-long journey towards becoming nicer or more human and humane. The book contains a wealth of detail -- much of it about Nash's contemporaries rather than about his own life; I'd say you get about one-third Nash, two-thirds Nash's acquaintances and company. It's impossible to write a biography, of course, without giving background details. But Nasar had great difficulty making both Nash's personality and his so-called ""Beautiful Mind"" comprehensible or appealing. A lot of what he did and thought was more ugly than beautiful. A different title would have helped greatly, I think. Anyway, Nasar's way of coping with writing about Nash himself was to take refuge in describing those around him who were less successful but easier to describe, or who were more extreme in personality or who achieved greater acclaim before he did. She wants to show that he, to some extent, ranks with the greatest thinkers of any time -- people like Nicola Tesla, Einstein, Pascal. This may be true, and when she showed how Nash sought to approach the really knotty problems, especially those considered important by many people -- it works. But Nasar is terrible at explaining math in its particulars or in general. She does little better with the relationship between math and applied-math fields which so often involved Nash directly or ended up being important to the application of what he'd originated as so-called pure mathematics. I was ready to forgive the movie for this -- and while it gives only a suggestion of the math involved, at least it does this well, even exceptionally -- but not the book. There are close to one-hundred pages of notes at the end of Nasar's books -- and seeking those sources is the only hope for those intrigued by Nash's accomplishments or areas of research. The best ""story"" of the book, the only part well-narrated, comes near the end, and involves the Noble Prize and the fight between the Noble committee members over choosing Nash. It's a great story. In the book, after it becomes clear Nash has shown signs of recovering from schizophrenia, a slow and steady progression over ten or twenty years -- Nasar raises the question of whether Nash might have been misdiagnosed as schizophrenic. No one recovers from schizophrenia, especially without drugs -- that's what people used to think, many still do -- and both book and movie mention this belief. Manic-depression, however, is known to often be well-controlled with medications. I've had direct contact with manic-depressives and relatives of them, much more so than with schizophrenics -- to me there's no question that Nash was not a manic-depressive. On the other hand, from all indications, Nash was someone who suffered, at times severely, from schizophrenia, with paranoid delusions. The paranoid element of his illness may be to some degree realistically and imaginatively treated in the movie. Where the movie strays very far from the truth, in a sort of Disney way, is in the creation of his imaginary college roommate and then later with the roommate's cute little daughter who never ages. Nash never had any hallucinations or delusions of that sort; he imagined aliens were communicating with him, and felt he'd gained knowledge which would help world leaders, presidents and premiers, and even sought to communicate with the Pope. He did clip headlines from newspapers and magazines, as the movie depicts -- in connection with this paranoid-delusional obsession. The character of the roommate is well-acted, however; I personally felt it was an excellent performance. But, be that as it may, especially with the addition of the roommate's daughter, it makes for the movie's major failing. What results is a cuddly and almost kindergarten-level metaphor or simplification as part of the portrait of both the disease and of Nash's experience of it. When I watched the film, despite never having personally known or witnessed someone with schizophrenia -- I had a feeling schizophrenics and their families would find those sequences of the film offensive or simply ridiculously untrue to life. Reading other reviewers' comments, that hunch seems well justified. Nonetheless, granting that the movie departs in some large ways from the real events of Nash's life, and blunders badly with the phantom roommate element -- it's still a great film. Great movies and great books often do have blunders, sometimes serious ones, or weak sections. In this case, I think the movie especially can be forgiven its faults and distortions because of the challenge of portraying such difficult subjects. By that I mean not only Nash himself, as a personality, but more broadly the topics of advanced mathematics and schizophrenia. Secondly, it does have its heart in the right place -- the patient and loving care of family and friends can play a major role in helping mentally-ill people (not to exclude the role of doctors and medical treatments). Finally, I think it's an extraordinary performance by Russell Crowe. He's better in ""The Insider"" -- but from the all-too-little of what Nash was really like in speech and in personal mannerisms which does at times come through in Nasar's book -- Crowe's portrayal has elements of genius. Certainly the scriptwriter deserves recognition, here, too -- since the book provides mainly the film's title and little in the way of dialog or coherent narrative thrust. Some reviewers have complained that Crowe is too much of a muscle-man to portray such an intellectual. But Nash was strong; he lifted weights -- he was physically imposing, especially since he was quite tall as well. So, if you want to complain on behalf of tall-people that it was unfair to select Crowe to play Nash -- OK. But give the idea that smarts and brawn never go together a rest. Nash was not only tall and strong, but as photos and text in Nasar's biography demonstrate -- quite handsome. He had movie-star good looks when he was young and before his illness led to a decline in his dress and appearance.",

I had never really been fond of Russell Crowe, math, Ron Howard, or paranoid schizophrenia.  And just didn't find the subject matter intriguing.  I was mistaken! ****POSSIBLE SPOILERS****This movie grabbed me from the beginning and held my interest until the ending credits.  Crowe took the viewers with him as he plumetted further and further into false reality, and then he took us back out as he was , with the help of his wife and friends, able to control his delusions.  I am pleased that this film won best screenplay, but disappointed that Best Actor did not go to Crowe. He was brilliant, and he has changed my mind about his abilities as an actor.  This movie has gotten some criticism for not staying true to the book and for being too ""Hollywood"" and/or ""sentimental"".  To those people, first of all, IT IS A MOVIE, you cannot change that.  Movies and books are different.  Things have to be changed, added, or taken out here and there to make films work, it's that simple.  If you haven't seen this yet, rent it.

520,16 April 2002,yaseminturkish,9, Follows the tradition of the mental illness genre but Russell Crowe elevates the film to a new level,An ordinary mental illness genre film would have dissolved into the typical paint by numbers rule in which the lead actor adequately performs his role and his problems are understood only by the audience.  A Beautiful Mind follows the rule that only the audience and his wife can sympathize with the mental patient but it develops into something more because of the difficulty and depth of Russell Crowe's performance.  Do you remember the small but poignant scene where John Nash attempted to hold his newborn son in the rocking chair?  It was a simple scene that wouldn't be difficult for an actor but the facial expressions and look of pain in Crowe's eyes elevated it to a new level.  Say what you want about Crowe and his real-life shenanigans but be open to the idea that liking him as an actor should be more about how he performs in his roles and less about condemnation of his bad-boy persona.,

Jennifer Connelly gives a superb performance and she adds depth to her role as the stoic supportive wife. We can see her fear grow as the evidence mounts against her husband. Through her frustration the audience gets a sense of how hard it would be to stand by someone with that kind of illness. This makes the payoff at the end all the more sweet. But the fact that Nash's life story was cleaned up for the big screen does unfortunately detract from the movie. One can almost feel the focus groups and marketing surveys determining how the film will finally play out. This is a shame because of the remarkable and convincing way the audience is set-up to discover that Nash suffers from schizophrenia. If the film had gone on past the point where it ended I think it would have scored a bullseye. Because even without knowing that certain parts of Nash's life were left out, I still wondered if he really said the things he said when he gave his speech.

We see the character struggle with his life because of the illness he had. But thanks he's not alone there are his friends and his love interest who is always with him. The story set in many points in time. We see main character growing up and see what he has been through over the years which is remind me of 'Forrest Gump'. It's all about acceptance and loyalty. I don't know anything about this movie before watching it so by the end when they revealed that this is based on a true story of John Nash, a matematician who won a Nobel Prize in 1994 makes love this movie even more. Great performance by Russell Crowe for depicting mental illness and of course there is Jennifer Connelly whose acting can't be doubted.

Russell Crowe is fantastic as Nash.  This is a signature performance that will captivate moviegoers with a magnetic energy.  Nash's slow but steady decent into paranoid pscyzophrenia is troubling, puzzling and heartbreaking.  The character ages 50 years through the course of the film, weaving him in and out of delusions that are not made clear until the midpoint of the movie.  The first half is remenicent of the clever trickery and manipulation that the 6th Sense had, and until you realize he has this delusional disorder, you dont understand that half of what is one the screen is not real.  The 2nd half of the picture depicts Nash's struggle to overcome the illness on his own terms - using his ""beautiful mind"" to beat his degeneration.  He is a complex character, at times insecure, and others extremely arrogant and blunt, obsessed with his mathematic breakthroughs and fantasy life as a Pentagon agent.  Jennifer Connolley is good as his wife, who stands by John through decades of uncertainty and maddness.  The ending feels a bit too sweet and nice to feel very real.

593,21 November 2022,mahdypersonal,8, Very compelling drama about the delusion of CIA code cracking getting in the way of a life of a career as a professor in math.,"A Beautiful Mind is a powerful account of the life of Nobel Prize winner and mathematician John Nash. The movie depicts Nash's expedition through life with schizophrenia. Nash displays numerous characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia, including delusions, hallucinations, fear of persecution, and lack of interpersonal connections. In the beginning of the movie, Nash is an withdrawn, focused youthful man digging for the perfect original idea as a graduate pupil at Princeton's competitive math department. Even then it's apparent that Nash is unlike from his associates; he doesn't follow social cues and ergo doesn't have numerous interpersonal connections. His main social connection is his roommate, Charles, who becomes his best friend. He develops a "" game theory, "" contradicting 150 years of economic theory. This theory gains him a position at MIT. Through this position he meets and marries, Alicia, a graduate student who falls for Nash despite his social ineptness. As time progresses, Alicia watches Nash sluggishly remove himself from the real world as he works with Agent Parcher from the CIA who has recruited him to break codes. Eventually it becomes evident that Nash requires psychiatric care, and Alicia discovers that her husband suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. Nash learns that not only is Agent Parcher a hallucination, but Charles and Charles's niece, whom he has maintained a close relationship with, are also hallucinations. After his institutionalization, Nash becomes very withdrawn from society, not venturing outside his house and is cared for primarily by his wife. This movie does an excellent job in emphasizing the burden a psychiatric illness can put on loved ones. Alicia feels a burden in having to care for Nash as well as their newborn son, and is understandably desperate over the fact that Nash isn't the man she married anymore. Nash finds that he doesn't have his same thinking capacities with taking the drug, so he, like many other patients with schizophrenia, secretly stops taking his drug. The seriousness of the matter becomes apparent to his wife when she finds his cottage full of newspaper clippings after allowing Nash to give their son a bath. Nash believes that Charles is watching his son, and if it weren't for his wife, his son would have drowned. Nash and his wife agree that they would try and work things out without the drug; that if Nash knew what was real and what wasn't, he could perform in the real world. Nash sluggishly reintegrates himself into the academic community. He slowly returns to tutoring and research and in 1994, he receives the Nobel Prize in economics.",

634,27 September 2008,Dario_Gino,6, Excellent Hollywood-ized version of the man and his madness,"This resulted in four well-deserved Academy Awards in 2002: Best Picture for Brian Grazer and the people at Imagine Entertainment, Ron Howard for his direction, Jennifer Connelly for her supporting role, and Akive Goldsman for his script adapted from Sylvia Nasar's biography. It is a beautiful and touching movie, uplifting and full of a lot of things that Hollywood does very well. Russell Crowe is believable as the arrogant yet vulnerable mathematician John Nash who fell into paranoid schizophrenia while an undergraduate at Princeton University. A philandering and selfish man who is paradoxically almost as lovable as Albert Einstein, Nash can also be humble and exhibit a wry, self-effacing sense of humor. To me he is a great hero, not because of his work in Game Theory for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, but because he is one of the very few people ever to conquer, as it were, schizophrenia. In the outstanding documentary from The American Experience PBS series, ""A Brilliant Madness"" (2002) Nash explains how he did it: he just stopped listening to the voices. The voices that the paranoid schizophrenic hears are inside his head and they are amazingly persuasive; the delusions are as compelling as monstrous personages come to life, vivid, demanding, in many ways more ""real"" than the reality we normally experience. So it really was heroic of John Nash to come to grips with his delusions and to mentally shove them aside. The vast majority of paranoid schizophrenics can never do that. Yet the movie merely resembles his life and his singular experience. Goldsman's script and Howard's direction take the life of John Nash and distill the essence of his triumph while brushing aside many of the unpleasant and non-heroic details. I don't object to this because this movie is clearly aimed at the widest possible audience, and I appreciate the wisdom of that approach. But for those of you interested in a more comprehensive and objective picture of the man I can recommend both the documentary mentioned above and Nasar's biography. I especially found it valuable to view the one-hour documentary because to actually see the man and to hear him speak allowed me to better appreciate the fine performance by Russell Crowe. I found Jennifer Connelly absolutely mesmerizing as Alicia (not to mention gorgeous). Ed Harris was a hardcore graphic nightmare as the unrelenting Parcher while Paul Bettany was intriguing and clever as Nash's nonexistent buddy. Howard's direction not only got excellent work from everybody, but he was able to bring the pathos and exhilaration of Nash's life to the audience in a very satisfying way emotionally. If you can watch this without shedding a tear or two you may want to check your synaptic connections. Incidentally the makeup work on Crowe and Connelly to allow us the illusion of the passing years was outstanding (and got an Oscar nomination). The key to the movie and to Howard's vision is the way that the real world and the Nash's delusional world are meshed. It's clear he wanted to compel the audience to share the paranoid schizophrenic experience. While not a paranoid schizophrenic myself I have known people who are, and I have had similar, limited experiences myself under certain, shall we say, circumstances. The sheer terror that can sometimes be felt came through in the car chase scene (yes, Howard managed to get one in) while Nash's obsessive energy was revealed on the walls of the rooms that he had completely covered with pages from magazines that he had frantically searched looking for secret Soviet codes. Some quibbles: while undergraduates loved beer then as they do now, they did not in 1946 go out for pizza, and if they had they would have called it ""pizza pie."" There were no pizza parlors and no pizza at the market. If you went to an Italian restaurant you had spaghetti or ravioli, and the pizza that was served was mostly bread with a thin topping of cheese and sauce, nothing like the great thin platters we have today. New Zealander Russell Crowe's West Virginia accent faded in some scenes only to return strong in another. Incidentally he is not to be confused with Cameron Crowe, who wrote the script for Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) and directed such films as Jerry Maguire (1996) and Almost Famous (2000). Russell Crowe has starred in a number of excellent movies including Proof (1991), LA Confidential (1997), The Insider (1999), etc. Also, no mention in the movie is made of Nash's homosexual experiences nor of his running away to Europe or his desire to renounce his US citizenship. I understand that Howard decided to leave out the homosexual angle because associating homosexuality with schizophrenia would open a can of worms that would detract from the theme of the movie. Also left out was Nash's other paternity with a woman he never married. Nash is not a saint, but he is a hero, and this beautiful movie is a fine tribute to him and his accomplishments.",

644,31 January 2002,msteedle,6," Very good, but not great","I have to admit that this movie was very good, although I don't think it is as great as the rest of the world, apparently.  Nash's sickness was exploited for dramatic purposes (in actuality, he might think he is seeing someone, but would not actually think he is rubbing a little girl's hair or kissing her forehead in thin air).  The directing was adequate, but utilitarian.  I wonder if most people know what a director actually does, or if they just lump the categories of best movie and best director together. Ron, I think we have seen enough of the shot with the camera revolving around Cameron Crowe's head by the third time you used it.  The acting was great all around.  The script was also good, but included only selected parts of Nash's life - only those that make him seem like a wonderful man. The writers chose to leave the parts of his real life out like when he got divorced, had illegitimate children, etc.  I guess that would have negated the ending (spoiler?)  This movie was pretty good - a 7 or 8 out of 10 - but I just don't like watching somebody's tragic life embellished for entertainment purposes.",

As John Nash mumbles through complex math theories, the entire audience is just spellbound. I am quite sure most of us don't have a clue as to what he was saying, it didn't matter. Being said by Russell Crowe is enough for us to know it matters. Very few actors have ever been able to do that, Brando comes to mind. The pleasant surprise from the movie was the script itself. I have heard the buzz for Crowe, and for Connelly...both deservedly so. But, I have not heard much about the power and humor of the script. Akiva Goldsman did a great job, as adapting books is hopefully becoming a specialty (Sum of All Fears is next). The Oscar buzz is not just hype, this is a serious contender for Crowe, Connelly, picture, adapted screenplay, and possibly director, although our buddy Ron is up against some tough customers this year.",

However, the story of John Nash itself simply isn't all that interesting and one gets the impression that Hollywood is trying too hard to make a story out of nothing.  I mean Nash's mental conditions was heavily emphasized throughout the film that it came across more on a movie about mental disorders.  I wished the film devoted more time emphasizing Nash's contributions to mathematics and why his contributions were important.  At the very end you do hear a bit about that but that was much too late after 2 hrs worth of riding through Nash's mental problems.  This movie had chances to become really good, but instead of going deeper into explaining in layman's terms the contributions of Nash, so we can appreciate his ""beautiful mind"", we get carried away into Nash's nightmares and drowned for 2 hrs in Nash's mental state that could've been explained in 15 minutes.

Russel Crowe's performance is certainly Oscar-worthy, becoming Nash on screen and realistically and emotionally portraying this character that is so different from others he has played on screen.  Ron Howard deserves a big nod, as well for successfully allowing the audience to get into Nash's mind and share with him his fears and relationships due to his mental condition.

I was scared when the people who he thought were Russians finally caught them and of course I didn't believe them when they said that he was in a phsychiatric hospital, but the more that I put the pieces together, the more it made sense.  It was creepy in my mind when his wife goes back to where he left all those letters and unfathomable to me how a man can imagine everything that he saw and pass it off as true.  It must be a truly frightening life style to live not knowing what is real and what is imaginary.  Somehow, though, he overcame all these obstacles.

Disgruntled, I watched this movie and Oh, my Gosh! Mathematics makes so common and simple things so overwhelmingly profound. What more do you need to know that the fact that there is an infinity in between any two numbers! In fact, when you think of any two numbers, or any number for that matter, it is somewhere from the infinity between any other two... continuity is made discontinuous instantly. Jhon Nash is a figure who lives it. Alisha makes love infinite. Nash drowns and develops gills. Alisha swims in the sky. The Noble prize in the end is often seen as belittling most of Nash's so called Rough work, which must not be. Well, I hope it helps you understand that there is an infinity within everything, more so in what we feel. It's a lovely story. Russel and Jennifer are immaculate and almost seem like living it all through.

694,16 January 2003,Alcyryal,9, Definetly worth my time (MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS),"This film gives us a look into the mind of John Nash, the Nobel Prize-winning mathematician, and his endless battle with schizophrenia. Russel Crowe protrays John Nash with great detail, so well that I was able to believe that he was mentally ill. Director Ron Howard does an incredible job showing the frightening reality of this horrible disease by showing the audience what Nash was seeing. When the I learned the truth about what was going through Nash's mind, it shocked me, as it was designed to do. Ron Howard was also able to show one of the horrors of mental hospitals of old with the highly disturbing electroshock scene. It scared me to know that Nash had to endure this kind of torture(Which, by the way had no beneficial effects for the patient. It was used, in my opinion only for punishment).",
695,9 January 2002,DrMoonlight,8, Honest and touching.,"I was a little skeptical when a friend recommended A Beautiful Mind to me.  My experience with Ron Howard's films has been less than delightful, and I was still angry at the dim-witted, wasteful Grinch released last year (especially when I learned that Dr. Seuss had refused every offer to let his stories be turned into live-action films). Thankfully, my friend's reccomendation was warranted, and I found this movie to be perhaps the most honest look at mental illness to come out of Hollywood in years.  I found this story especially touching because I recognized in Crowe's portrayal of Nash a strong resemblance to a very dear friend of mine, who posesses the same combination of psychotic tendencies and astronomical intelligence. Many film portrayals of mental illness show their characters essentially being cured of uncurable disorders.  Beautiful Mind shows a much bleaker reality.  Nash, like millions of others all over the world, can learn to adapt to some extent, but will live with his schizophrenia for the rest of his life.  As heartbreaking as Nash's story is, it is important to remember that among paranoid schizophrenics, he is relatively lucky to have companionship, employment, housing, and an intelligence that allows him to understand and fight his illness.  The vast majority of those with his disorder are homeless, friendless, and perpetually confused. But his fortune, for some reason, helps make him sympathetic to the audience, as  do a series of plot presentation devices which force the audience into his shoes in a way that very few movies have managed to do. Sadly, for all the strengths of this film (including an astonishing performance by Crowe), they are too often overshadowed by Howard's weaknesses as a director.  I was especially underwhelmed by his liberal use of Horner's mediocre soundtrack.  Many scenes would have been much stronger relying on the weight of the dialogue and the power of silence. The music was used in a way that was distracting and often made beautiful moments feel somehow manufactured and artificial. Beautiful Mind is, however, a beautiful film, and if you have someone in your life with a mental illness, you will find it particularly essential.  Even if you don't, this film is a powerful catalyst in helping us all understand",

I found it didn't spoil the plot for me though, in fact, it made it more enjoyable because I was easily manipulated. I was trying to understand throughout what it was that made the protagonist, John Nash (Crowe) schizophrenic. Then, when it gets to the point where it's made clearer, that's not the end of it! The rest of the film shows how he lives with the illness.",
697,22 February 2005,faded_Glory,7, Good in parts,"I am in two minds about this one (sorry folks!). On the plus side, the way the movie depicts the mind of John Nash from his perspective is very good. I hadn't actually heard all that much about this film before I saw it, so I must be one of the few who didn't know for sure that Nash is indeed hallucinating until the scenes with the empty barn behind his house (Have you hearrrd the storrry of the Empty Barrrrn..). I am probably thick, but to maintain the uncertainty as to what is real and what is not until that far into the film is very strong, and really rams home what schizophrenia can be to those who suffer from it. Until that point, the film might have been just as well a political thriller instead of a psychological drama. Great, but it works only once, of course.",

I had no idea what to expect. As a university professor I was interested in the picture of academia in the 50's. The film then started to lose it's way. It threatened to deteriorate into a Hollywood spy thriller. The brilliant mathematician (John Nash) hired by dumb spooks. Just as my interest waned it turned out that the secret undercover work was actually a paranoid schizophrenic fantasy. Having being confronted by this debilitating mental dysfunction at close hand (my sister) for most of my life, the film became suddenly captivating. Here and there stereotype Hollywoood sentimentality prevents the film from becoming a really great film, but it remained stimulating and moving right through to the end. The next day I checked out the movie content with a genuine biography and interview with John Nash himself. The movie is not entirely accurate - Nash never actually had visual delusions, but he did experience voices. In the movie Nash is stabilizes and continues to take medication. In reality he has not taken medication for the last thirty years.",

The main character is selfish, socially awkward, and very weird. But somehow, Crowe makes us connect with him through his amazing acting, and actually puts us in his shoes. By the time the movie ends, you will most likely be looking up John Nash's true story just because you connect with him in the movie (I would not recommend looking up the true story until after watching the movie, because it will spoil a twist in the movie). The acting is better than almost anything I have ever seen. Russell Crowe gives an amazing performance (as always), and you'd almost expect it to say ""Actual Footage"" at the bottom of the screen.

I really think that Russell Crowe does a great job in portraying mental illness as a very real and harsh thing to have to live with. I think that One problem that I did have with it was that it really did not accurately portray schizophrenia very well. In the movie John Nash was clearly having visual hallucinations, which is really not that common in real life and the real John Nash even said that he never had visual hallucinations. However I guess that this just to make the movie more interesting. It would have been more boring if he was just having auditory hallucinations. I think that my favorite scene is when he first meets Dr. Rosen (who is my favorite character) at the math council and John Nash things that he is a Russian spy.

I was not caught up in all the over the top praise that was handed out to him and the Gladiator film and the over praise for that outing caused me to wonder about his ability.  The combination of his performance in A Beautiful Mind together with his very nice showing in The Insider clearly display his credentials as one fine actor.  Whether this is the best movie of a, hopefully, high quality year of good films or it is the best movie coming out at the end of a particularly lousy year for Hollywood - it qualifies either way.  I wonder if we won't see Crowe miss out on an Academy Award for this one since he got the one he didn't deserve for Gladiator.

It´s a realistic psychologic movie about a man who´s suffering from schizofrenia. There are a couple of thing that makes this movie great. First of all, the movie makes you understand a little bit how someone who has schizofrenia experience the world. Second, the two leading actors performance (Nash-Russel Crowe-and his wife) is really outstanding. By my opinion Crowe deserved a second Oscar for this performance. The third reason this movie is excellent is that the movie really does something with you; watching this movie certainly should be an emotional experience witch takes you in the life of John Nash, former Nobel price winner. Last, it´s a true story, which gave me an extra dimension to this movie. So, I can recommend this movie to anyone who´s kind of good movies, with a great script and excellent actor´s performances.

Until the great twist, that comes so unexpected it is entertaining, but not very outstanding. Though it really develops to a well-acted movie about the dramatic life of this poor man, and seeing this man being destroyed by himself is so stirring, that boredom soon is replaced by sympathy for Nash and his wife, who suffer badly under the circumstances that nearly destroy his life. Unfortunately the more this movie tries to be dramatic, the more Hollywood kitsch annoys the audience, so people who like happy ends will be satisfied. Beside that, it's a pity that only this special part of his life is shown to the audience, so we get more information about his tragic fate than about himself and his work.",
716,12 September 2013,Luminous_Blackhole,10, The best ever in my view,"One of the best ways to describe this movie is that it is so realistic, which is also the very reason for my liking. In each phase of the movie, the Russell's character depicts the realistic nature of a human being, which indeed is reinforced by his artistic and more naturalistic way of acting only to make it more realistic and which makes you like it. Connelly is my favorite actress, however I am not biasing when I say, that she has performed her role so beautifully. I just started loving her after I watched this movie. So, basically, the movie is about a maths professor who is so lively and exuberant about his works and always tries to prove something. Is he really working as he thinks he is or is he just fooling himself?? Ron moved the movie so meticulously that the watcher doesn't get deviated or at least doesn't want to. I recommend everyone watch this movie unless they want to miss a work of masterpiece. I bet everyone cried at the end of the movie. I did. Though I guarantee you, its a happy ending.

The story itself doesn't feel 'slapped together', in fact, the story is quite good... if you're interesting in personal life stories. Russel Crowe's acting nearly puts a tear in your eye because you actually feel for him in certain situations. Superb on Crowe's part. What prevents this movie from being anything higher than 7 is the fact that the majority of the audience will think its a yawnfest, kudos to you if you are a patient person.

I've always known that genius is a person who can see the answer before the question, and this is perfectly exemplified and shown by Ron Howard.

The book did not entertain me, it gave me an in-depth look at Mr. Nash's life.  The movie allowed me to enter the heart and mind of Mr. Nash and the people who surrounded him at the given times the director chose to explore. Possibly the only scene not necessary was the car chase - yet, the fear portrayed by Mr. Crowe redeemed even that particular moment.",

It is the most touching and fantastic movie i saw in my whole life.  I saw this movie with my mom. and i cryed 3 times during the movie. the i got the movie on DVD at home and when i put on those parts i did agian. The whole sotryline is fantastic! And it is a shame that Russel Crow didint got the Oscar! He played fantastic!,
738,28 June 2002,themudlark,8, Superb,"I had to get by Russell Crowe's media personality to actually get it up to see this movie.  I'm glad I did.  He is absolutely fabulous in this movie and truly is one very fine actor.  Of course, it helps working in a movie that is well directed, well edited, and very well written.  Doesn't follow any ""formulas"" of which I am aware and wound up telling quite an unusual story in a very interesting manner.  Jennifer Connelly was excellent as John Nash's incredibly tolerant wife.  She could show you the love she had for him and the pain their circumstances brought her as well.  Paul Bettany as Charles was a lively contrast to Nash's down-trodden personality. Intelligent, interesting, and entertaining.  One fine movie.  A must see.",

Partly, he was mad---called by someone living in the real world---he is sick,seriously sick!But with this imagining picture/figure, there was another thing living in his mind---the greatest,most powerful one---his talent for maths,physical---the science. He was hooked in all those things. What is his life? i think all his life would mean nothing except for solving the problems, studying and the true love btw he and his wife,witch we can found in the end of the movie. In a word, he's a great man in the field of science. As a sick/mad person, what he needs most is not the cure,but someone to understand him, trust him, help him. And who's the one?yeah, his wife. i can say, the woman is the most great wife in the world that i've ever seen. She chosed to stay with him not to leave him when he was in the greatest trouble. and all she did really encouraged him to face to the truth, to fight against the sickness---the picture in his mind not existence, to go on with his work---solve the problem. and finally, he made a succeed!! He won the nobel prize.( remember at the beginning of the movie, someone pointing to a man whom everyone in the hall gave their pen to show the hornor to , said to John that "" you will never gain the honor"" but at last, he made it! and the same scene replayed in front of his eyes, he made it!) in the end of the movie,what he said at the desk is that "" all my reason is love"" and on hearing that, i was deeply moved and see what a beautiful mind he's got!",

However, achieving cinematic beauty is something else. Beauty lies in the emotion, dedication and passion of good filmmaking; beautiful films are the one's made for a purpose.

It successfully investigates the implications of dealing with schizophrenia, from minor inconveniences to larger problems with the potential to deliver devastating consequences.

Around this central theme, another very moving story evolves of true love by an incredibly courageous & wise partner as played very convincingly by Jennifer Connelly. The special traditions and customs of a typical upper class University add yet another fine flavor to this superb movie. Well deserved awards, but too few as Russell Crowe is simply magnificent :)",
749,7 December 2001,JamesDean,7, An Unlikely Masterpiece,"When I went to this advance screening of A Beautiful Mind I expected a strong film due to Ron Howard and Russell Crowe being associated to this movie.  My expectations were high and they were more than met, the preview for this film is kind of misleading there is really a strong story at the heart of this film.  It's not like a biography of John Nash it is merely based around some events that took place in Nash's life.  I predict that this film will grad a best picture, best director, best actor, and best supporting actress nomination when the academy awards nominees are announced in february.  The same way that other recent movies have had success by helping the viewer to escape this film helps you to escape but into a more realitic setting.  Crowe's performance could actually win him another oscar I know it's hard to win back to back but his performance is really THAT impressive.  But what really holds the film together is Jennifer Connelly who stole every scene she was in, in the harsh independent film Requiem for a Dream.  Connelly is the balance to the film because it's hard for the viewer to always understand Crowe's Nash.  Connelly gives the same kind of supporting balance to the film as Marcia Gay HArden gave last year in Pollock.  A Beautiful Mind will be remembered as the film where even Crowe's harshest critics will have to admit that the he's talented.",

Crowe does great work, though his fidgeting is difficult to watch at times, and Connelly, Bettany and Harris support him perfectly. Unlike most biographies, the movie doesn't come off as a series of vignettes from the subject's life, it's all tied together very nicely and cleanly. It's a fascinating story, no matter how much of it was left out, though it may not be Best Picture material, but then few movies are.",
752,14 February 2002,dribe,8, Most Overrated Film of 2001!,"As a graduate film student, I watch hundreds of movies a year.  By now, I can tell a good film from a bad one.  A Beautiful Mind, as with most of Ron Howard's movies, is somewhere in between.  It has some satisfying moments, but just doesn't make it all the way to home base.  It's definitely an admirable effort and I did enjoy the film, but I thought it was lacking in dialogue, plot, visual appeal, and imagination. After watching A Beautiful Mind steal the Golden Globe, and quite possibly the Oscar, for Best Film from The Lord of the Rings, I have a new disliking for this mediocre film.  Anyone who has seen The Insider, also starring Russell Crowe in a drama about a real-life person, should know that it is a far more superior film in every aspect.  Go out and rent it now and you'll see that Michael Mann knows what he is doing.  And no recent film has better dialogue than The Insider. Getting back to ABM, the performances by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly are pleasing, but Russell's character just seems to be an overly quirky and confused version of his character in The Insider.  And will somebody tell me how Jennifer Connelly has managed to look the same for the past 10 years!  Now that's impressive. I keep hearing critics comment on how ABM does such a wonderful job in getting the audience inside the mind of a genius and schizophrenic.  How do they do it?  Special effects.  I was not impressed by this, with the exception of the code-breaking scene.  And the entire movie is about a character that I don't really like.  What caused his schizophrenia?  In the movie, it is apparently John F. Nash's inflated ego.  He refuses to go to classes with ""mere mortals"" losing their ability to be creative.  He drives himself crazy because he wants to be more important than he really is.  And no one even mentioned his bisexuality and divorce from his wife... Well, if you loved this movie, that's great.  It's a relatively good film, much better than some of the trash that comes out these days.  And I don't believe in criticizing films.  Film, to me, is a wonderful and powerful art medium.  I fully realize how difficult it is to make a good film and how there are an overwhelmingly large number of challenges and obstacles to juggle with when doing so.  The only reason I'm writing this is because of the surprisingly high-regard people have for this movie.  It's not that great, and it better not win the Oscar even though that haunting prospect seems very likely.  I should also add that I have a lot of respect for John F. Nash, Jr. and all of his accomplishments.  It's just that this film doesn't accomplish as much.",

My only moral support is my loving mother. i have no wife and people actually discourage me from trying to find one!My past friends have long forgotten me and some from my childhood seem to be ridiculing me calling me a loser, a failure and a bum. At least the world allowed John Nash some semblance of dignity in his illness. His neighbors nor the police ridiculed him. I am not an important scientist like John Nash. I had a nervous breadkdown in graduate school my senond year. I spend my time in independent Bible study as a part time Christian writer. As a matter of fact, I had once sent a resume to Univerisal Pictures years before that movie came out on a lark thinking because of my superntural dreams that God might be calling me into character acting-maybe I might play a ""heavy"" in a drug movie or something. Did Universal pick up on my resume and cover letter and decide to make this movie about Schizophrenic genius John Nash? I had bought the PBS American EXPERIENCE video A BRILLIANT MADNESS chronicalling the life of John Nash, too. Because of my illness the subject interested me. The real life of John Nash is a bit different from Ron Howard's fairy tale story. John Nash actually quit taking his meds after awhile and got better! I also had the personal realization that since John Nash never went to class at Princeton and got his PhD basically doing independent study, I realize that there could be some educational or academic value to my 15 years of part time Bible study!",

Thought provoking, intense, and incredibly acted, this film is a gem. Winner of 4 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actress. Also Nominated for Best Actor, Best Score, and Best Makeup. Russell Crowe stars in an amazing performance as the brilliant mathematician John F. Nash. John isn't social, isn't really popular, and definetly not great with the ladies. But, he is gifted with a brilliant mind. He solves equation after equation looking for an original idea to become well known and respected. He's well on is way, and is successful. Life is perfect. Until he is hired by William Parcher (played by Academy Award nominee Ed Harris)to break codes during a Russian conspiracy. Everything is going well until he makes a shocking discovery that it is all fake. The conspiracy, his roommate who he befriends, and the roommate's adorable niece. All fake. Schizophrenia has taken over his life.  His wife is the only thing that can help him get threw this. Alicia (Academy Award Winner (for this) Jennifer Connelly) is there with him threw the hospitalizations, the struggles, the good times, but more the bad. She sticks with him, and thanks to her, John is able to win the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994. Jennifer Connelly's performance was nothing short of brilliant. She is luminous and exquisite.  The Oscar was well deserved. You can truly see her struggle to help her husband, to raise her son, and to stay sane herself. And, Russell Crowe, Russell Crowe. Only nominated this year for Best Actor (beaten out by Denzel Washington for ""Training Day"". Personally, I thought Russell was better!), Russell is still is as good as he has ever been. Truly amazing. He makes you cry, laugh, and cheer at the end. Russell's best performance to date!

It's at times frightening and pathetic, but you end up cheering for Nash in the end.  After seeing the movie, viewers will feel inclined to go back and rehash various scenes and say ""That's why that happened"" or ""I get it now!"" - something like ""The Sixth Sense"" made us do.

Still, I enjoyed the scenes with Ed Harris, he's wonderfully creepy as the mysterious agent. I also liked the way the movie showed how the guy saw strange patterns everywhere, that was pretty interesting. Jennifer Connelly is not near as good in this film as the reviews make her out to be. Her performance is not that big a deal. Russell Crowe was mostly convincing but often overly mannered as Nash.

791,4 March 2009,dyg953,10, A Beautiful Dream,"Russell Crowe said the following winning his academy award: ""You know, when you grow up in the suburbs of Sydney or Auckland or Newcastle like Ridley Scott or Jamie Bell or the suburbs of anywhere, a dream like this seems vaguely ludicrous and completely unattainable. But this moment is directly connected to those childhood imaginings, and for anybody who is on the downside of advantage and rely purely on courage -It's possible"" This movie tells a story of an impossible dream, the dream that John Nash someday might become what we refer to as ""normal"". The intelligence of Nash is obvious, and therefore it is no surprise that he discovers groundbreaking theories (his own original idea). However, the development of Nash is the centre of the entire picture, and Ron Howard has done a great job making these images possible. It's a great mystery to me that Crowe didn't win an academy award for this movie, his performance is excellent and flawless. The fact that Nash receives the Nobel Prize at the end of the movie shows us, the spectators, that with courage, heart, and soul our dreams are within reach. So therefore with the words of Crowe: ""It's possible!""",

The best movie of the year and one of the top movies of all time. Written beautifully, with acting that is truly outstanding, the movie is unsurpassed in giving viewers an insight into the horrific chasm one faces with this type mental illness. Russell Crowe accurately lives this character. Equalling or topping Dustin Hoffman's performance in ""The Rain Man"". (If you ever see any youthful pictures of Nash he even looks a lot like Crowe)",

Ron Howard does an amazing job of engaging his audience, introducing a brilliant main character, and making the audience experience the reality of mental illness. This could have been an unbelievable story to which very people could relate; however, the directorial mastery Howard exhibits throughout allows the audience to accompany Nash on his journey and awareness of his illness. Anyone who has been close to the frailties of the human mind will appreciate how respectfully and honestly this film approaches the subject. Howard is able to portray all the complex reactions to mental illness while maintaining the humanity and dignity of the patient.

In short, the movie is about dealing with mental illness with emotion. The Plot of the movie is very interesting, touching. Great as a Biographic film, Great as a Thriler film, and also as a Romance film. A beautiful mind is very different than most of the films in the genre- psychological thriller (for example - ""The silence of the lambs"" , ""Black Swan"") mainly because of the use of emotional to solve the mental problem and find a solution for the illness. The Direction in the movie is extremely professional, Ron Howard definitely made his best work in the film, he pays attention to the small details. The screenplay is even better than the direction, clever and very original. The Acting in the movie is absolutely great!

I liked the visual approach of the movie giving us an insight that was not available in the book, a novel perspective and an interesting solution, but I think that, as it was stated in the New York Times, the audience could have been trusted with the complexity of the situation. The portrayal of Nasar is so much more intense, and some much more realistic. I liked the movie, but would recommend that anybody who sees it read the real thing afterwards in a wonderfully written biography that shows you that life with a genious, with madness, with a mad academic world and in a paranoid era was very very far from the hollywood treatment of it. The acting by Crowe and the visual idea of getting us into that world was wonderful, but I hope that there is in the future more trust that an audience can deal with much more complexity.

It was so flat I couldn't believe there actually was a director- it seems someone simply aimed a camera at Russel Crowe and then left. Every scene is blandness epitomised- it's an interesting story, and Russel Crowe is a good actor, but Ron Howard has made such a hash of this it's incredible. I honestly think I could have done a better job. Not a single scene stood out- it all gelled into one mass of mediocrity. Ron Howard is carving a niche for himself as the most robotic director on the planet. No doubt the studio bigwigs love him. Not a bad film, though; but I can think of about 10-15 that were better last year- even Ghosts of Mars was more exciting than this (seriously). Please, Ron, take a few risks next time!",

That's really the curse of doing quasi-historical movies, I suppose. In any case, everything about Ron Howard's direction screamed BLAND. I thought Russell Crowe was decent in spite of Howard, and that Jennifer Connelly turned some dopey lines into a decent role. But despite all the polish, and a few enjoyable scenes, the story was hopelessly flawed. The work that got him the Nobel got barely a nod early on in the film, the love story which supposedly drives this was developed inadequately, etc. Perhaps Howard couldn't get any subtlety or depth because he was hamstrung by a merely adequate screenplay.

It was uninspiring garbage and it did not fit him.  Crowe has since redeemed himself with his role of genius John Nash.  About a year back, I picked up the book A Beautiful Mind and thought that this was one of the greatest stories ever told.  When the film was put into production, I felt cheated that a man like Russell Crowe was set to play Nash.  I was wrong.  Crowe grabbed this role and played it to the bone.

While a graduate in Princeton in the late 40's, he came up with his own ""governing dynamic"", a game theory - mathematics of competition, and after years of fighting his demons won the Nobel Prize in 1994. And this is a true story! Russell Crowe shows why he's a versatile actor by portraying Nash with sensitivity and passion. Jennifer Connelly did an excellent job as the woman who thought she was married to an eccentric man and did not leave his side after finding out about his illness. Ed Harris, Paul Bettany and Christopher Plummer did a fine job in their supporting role of ""explaining and showing"" the mindset of a schizophrenic. Trying to tell this story is not an easy task yet director Ron Howard did it without resorting to sensationalism. This movie gave me an insight of what a schizophrenic goes through on a daily life; not being able to distinguish between what's real and what's reality is frightening or using one's energy to push away the illusion is exhausting.

Casting Jennifer Connelly as Mrs. Nash, Paul Bettany, and Ed Harris as John's schizophrenics' muses elevates the ability of the film to draw you into its complexities.

This performance shows a true acting talent, not the usual Russell Crowe character looking like every other character.",
816,16 April 2002,Dble07jamesbond,10, Best movie seen at the theater in a long time,"A Beautiful mind was by far the best film I have seen in the theater for a little bit of time now. Before that I would say that the Sixth Sense was the best--although there were excellent movies that did come out after. (I had just seen those at home). Nevertheless, ""A Beautiful Mind"" should not be ignored and should be viewed by those who feel out of place with themselves and try their hardest to show their potential..but never seem to be able to get it across to someone. As a person, I do not particularly care for Russell Crowe. The whole hoopla behind the Academy might have done him in for an award, but nevertheless, Crowe shines as John Forbes Nash, Jr. in ""Mind"". His performance was that of how the old times in cinema used to be--very in touch with their characters, and flawless in their performances. Russell Crowe is comparible to Tony Curtis's portrayal of Albert De Salvo in Richard Fleischer's ""The Boston Strangler"". Although they are complete different performances, Crowe delivers his with the same impact of Tony Curtis's character. Mr. Crowe was phenomenal, and to my wishes, was not overlooked by the Academy but simply given a close race against Denzel Washington. Many people disagreed with Nash's schizophrenia not being unveiled until the middle of the film, and I will admit that it was upsetting to me, but the good aspects of this film really overshadowed the slight flaws of dislike within the movie. I was more disappointed that Nash was not in fact doing all these things for the government and aiding us at the times of the Cold War. However, Nash's true genius made up for this factor and allowed the viewer to see that he truly was a genius but just one that simply had to overcome an obstical that was so slight compared to the intelligence he possessed. Along with Crowe's magnificent performance, we were given a marvelous music score by James Horner. (I think that had Randy Newman not won simply for breaking his losing streak, Mr. Horner would have scooped up the award). The music added a beautiful tone to the movie and showed what Nash's mind must feel like within--eerie, confused, and beautiful. On a last note, As wonderful as Jennifer Connelly was in her role, I really think that her Oscar was uneccessary. She turned in a decent performance, but was certainly not Oscar caliber compared to the great Dame Maggie Smith's comic performance, and the ever charming Marissa Tomei's performance. But nevertheless, her Oscar just added to the movies list. :) If you intend on seeing a compelling movie with one of the best male actor's performance's in a long time, pull up a seat and watch ""A Beautiful Mind"". [Congrats to Ron Howard] :)",

826,23 December 2012,krkmz_64,10, that was awesome!,"Sylvia Nasar does a superb job of informing readers about John Nash's struggles with schizophrenia in the biography A Beautiful Mind. Nash, a Nobel Prize winner, is an eminent mathematician with (in the words of a colleague) ""a beautiful mind."" Unfortunately, it's also a sick mind. Although he manages to function ""normally"" these days, without the aid of medication, Nash is still a schizophrenic (who has an adult son who suffers from the same disease).As moviegoers know, Ron Howard directed the movie version of the book, starring Russell Crowe. While the film does a fine job of introducing audiences to the ins and outs of schizophrenia and the difficulties that caregivers experience while trying to assist someone afflicted with the disease, it shows only the tip of the iceberg. Anyone wanting to know more about what schizophrenia entails should read Nasar's book. It is gripping and reveals the agonies of a schizophrenic life. Thoroughly researched and effectively presented in a cohesive narrative which fully engages the attention of readers, this biography shows how Nash fell prey to the disease and how his family-first his mother and sister, and later his wife-sought to have him treated and provided with the best medical care then available. At one point that treatment called for electric shock treatment (as vividly dramatized in the movie).Nash's colleagues, many of whom had relatives who were schizophrenics or who were schizophrenics themselves, helped him time and time again, when he was at risk of becoming unemployed and/or destitute. Through sheer force of will, Nash managed to pull himself back from the brink and to pursue a life of domestic contentment and professional achievement. His is definitely a story worth knowing. And Nasar relates it in detail and comprehensively, helping readers to appreciate the horror of possibly losing such a beautiful mind.",

Despite problems of structure and tone, and some crucial omissions from Nash's actual life, A Beautiful Mind has emerged as one of the season's most enjoyable and popular films. Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly give stunning, emotional performances in A Beautiful Mind. Ron Howard has crafted a masterful film that is a revealing look at mental illness and deserves to be seen. Brilliantly put together to create suspense, brilliantly acted to make us feel for the characters (Jennifer Connelly is astonishing), and a moving story of love and determination, A Beautiful Mind is a beautiful film.",

It's not quite Shawshank or Apocalypse Now or The Matrix, nor is it trying to be, but it's the very cream of the next tier down.

I don't agree  with the people who were upset over all of his life not being included, inlcuding suggestions that Nash had homosexual relationships.  This is a work of fiction, not a biography or documentary.  But I do think it is unfortunate that Latinos only get cast as parts specifically written as Latino and that anglo actors get the opportunity to play Latinos.  There is not equal opportunity in Hollywood and it is disappointing.  Anyway, getting to the story! - I do think it is a wonderful, human story.  Ron Howard did a great job and I think it deserved all the attention at the Academy awards.

The beauty of this film is that you are not spoon fed the plot as is the cast in most of Hollywoods films, some could be confused.  You need to watch the film from beginning to end.

The film makes you tag on to John Nash's life and you don't formally know he has schizophrenia until he finds out himself, at first you doubt it as much as he did, but it's what you're suppose to think.

888,31 January 2002,edge-7,6, Movie is too distant to get feel attached to any of the characters,"""A Beautiful Mind"" seems to buy into itself too much and leaves the viewer wondering what's going on.  Unrealistic and unexplained sequences that are supposedly only in John Nash's head seem to get in the way of a story that could be interesting.  We are never really told why Nash is famous or if he actually did work for the CIA.  The love story between his wife (Jennifer Connely) is, again, not realistic in it's approach. Why does she fall in love with him and, more importantly, why do they get married and stay together.  Russell Crowe is good as John Nash, but the distance created between the actor and the audience is too much.  Jennifer Connely is good as well, but it is hard to figure her character out.  I never felt attached to either character, and didn't want to root for them to overcome.  Some of the scenes between the two are so over-the-top; the star-gazing scene is especially silly.  The last half hour of the movie is better, as we know what is going on and his life is explained.  The first portion of the movie is distant and cold, leaving a lot desired by the audience who wants to know who this guy is and what is really going on.  It is unlike ""The Sixth Sense"" when it is such a cool surprise when you find out he is actually dead. The imaginary characters in his head are never explained to having any relevance to his disease.  Not that is has to be spelled out, but why a little girl and his best friend who he never had.

Although the story was a bit of fiction (they somehow left out the real reason Nash left Wheeler Labs), it was actually a beautiful, inspiring and powerful story. In addition to the excellent story and directing, the acting was fabulous. When we sat down in the theatre, I said to my girlfriend ""Russell Crowe has a monumental task ahead of him: convincing me that he's a math dork, not General Maximus or Officer Bud White.""  I have to say that if anyone deserves an Oscar this year it is Russell Crowe.  He makes the audience compassionate for his character in a way that is not often seen.  Paul Bettany, Jennifer Conolley, and Ed Harris were also excellent in the supporting cast.  Overall, I gave this movie a '10.'  It is rare when Hollywood puts out such a wonderful movie.

Simply put, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a film which extends far beyond the 2 hours and 8 minutes that you will spend viewing it in the theater. The characters continued to haunt me after the movie, thanks to the Oscar-inducing performances by Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and all of the supporting players.  They are not merely acting, yet are transformed into the characters, leaving no trace of a line between their part and reality. Of course a film is only as good as a screenplay would allow, and the story contained within is written in a way that compliments everything that is truly great about ""A Beautiful Mind.""

The fact that Ron Howard directed makes it all the more worth seeing. I RARELY cry outside of moments with my wife and newborn son, but at the tail end of this movie even my eyes watered.

Russell Crowe's performance is brilliant, as usual, giving us insights into a character that I believe no other actor today is capable of. It will be a crime if he does not receive an Oscar for this role just because he won one last year.  Ron Howard has crafted a film of such emotion and power, it will also be criminal if he does not receive the recognition he deserves at Oscar time.  Jennifer Connelly is fantastic, as are the other supporting characters.  My only complaint about the movie is the choice of Charlotte Church for the vocals on the soundtrack; I'm not sure what it is, maybe her voice is just too ""instrument-like,"" but I was very disappointed in her performance of the love theme, ""All Love Can Be.""  Her voice blends into the music to such an extent that I can't hear or remember all the words, even though I have seen the movie more than once and have listened to the soundtrack several times.

You really feel for the mathematician as his problems worsen. That Nash is able to eke out so much triumph from his troubled life is a tremendous affirmation of the human spirit. It's based on a true story, but rather large liberties were taken with the story as it is told in the book. That's not really a bad thing, but somebody involved with the making of this movie did make a bad decision to use a rather common trick these days, used in movies as varied as ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Sliding Doors."" The trick involves presenting the audience with a point of view other than the standard movie narrative. The mistake made in this movie is that the view of Nash's hallucinations is presented so that the audience thinks there's a conspiracy for most of the movie. This probably made the movie more commercial, but it deflected the audience from the real drama in the story.",

918,25 February 2002,Bob_St_Cul,9," Right actor, wrong year?","I'm sure there are a few members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences who are kicking themselves for giving Russell Crowe the Best Actor Oscar in the wrong year. Crowe won last year for the costume epic Gladiator, although nominee Ed Harris was more deserving for his work in Pollock. This year, Crowe's stellar performance in A Beautiful Mind could be overlooked simply because he won last year. That would be a shame, because Crowe's portrayal of John Nash, the Nobel Prize-winning mathematician who has battled schizophrenia, is one of the top performances in film this year. Crowe covers 47 years of Nash's life, ranging from his grad school days at Princeton to his winning of the Nobel Prize. In between, he goes through hell.  In a role far removed from Gladiator, Crowe is utterly convincing as the troubled, socially inept Nash. From the film's beginning to the crisis point in Nash's illness, the tale is told from Nash's perspective-which gives director Ron Howard and scriptwriter Akiva Goldsman the chance to shine. Nash's delusions are apparent from the beginning-if you know where they are. They are interspersed with reality so well that they're bound to, at least partially, surprise the viewer when they are revealed. The result is a fascinating look at an illness whose hallucinations can seem all too real. Jennifer Connelly adds depth to her role as Alicia, Nash's long-suffering wife, who (at least in the movie) perseveres throughout Nash's illness and aids him to a gradual recovery. This film has been criticized for taking liberties with facts surrounding Nash. Some have argued that the film misrepresents schizophrenia and places it at the wrong time in Nash's life. Others have complained that the film fails to note that Nash fathered an illegitimate child, was divorced from Alicia for quite some time, and is allegedly bisexual.",

924,25 December 2001,bronx58,10, A thing of beauty indeed! Simply amazing!,"Simply beautiful!!!  This film is without a doubt one of the best I've ever seen!  I was treated to a preview of this beautiful film in advance of its opening.  Like some of the others who have submitted reviews here, I too was completely thrown off by the trailer for the film.  I expected to find a mediocre love story taking place in the midst of some kind of quasi-thriller.  Boy was I in for a surprise!  This movie delivers on so many levels.  It was indeed a thriller (although of a different sort)...and also delivered as a love story on several levels.  Yes, the beautiful and talented Mr. Crowe affects what was in my opinion a convincing enough West Virginia accent, but more mind blowing was seeing him adapt his mannerisms, posture, and gait to the various ages, and stages, of Mr. Nash's life.  His performance was brilliantly subtle, yet right on the money.  What more can I say?  The man is a truly amazing actor!  Truly gifted!  As for other aspects of the film...there are those who find Ron Howard's style of directing to be somewhat heavy handed in attempting to extract emotions from the moviegoer - I don't necessarily share that opinion.  I prefer to think that his films are imbued with ""heart.""  I enjoy his work, and I feel that this film especially was directed with a truly artistic touch.  I never felt as though I'd been manipulated.  On the contrary, I felt as though I'd had the privilege of being allowed on a very special and exclusive journey, and found the experience uplifting.  The film allows the viewer to peer into a great mind gone haywire...and to watch him use his genius to put it back together again.  It allows us to share in some of the challenges and uncertainty which exist in the daily lives of those who have a loved one with this type of illness.  To see Mr. Crowe's oh so subtle, very realistic, portrayal not only of what a schizophrenic experiences mentally - but how he appears to those watching from the outside...well, this was truly awesome! He masterfully avoided going overboard with the role.  Playing John Nash with quiet dignity...not at all over the top.  Both Mr. Crowe and Ms. Connelly bring tremendous honesty to their roles.  I was truly impressed seeing the love, the resoluteness, and at the same time the weariness that settles in under such circumstances on a long suffering mate, all flawlessly portrayed by Jennifer Connelly.  She took us through the gamut of emotions that Alicia Nash must have experienced.  In the ""first date"" scenes, Ms. Connelly is a vision, and throughout the film she is the embodiment of grace and beauty.  Also worth mentioning, Ed Harris turns in yet another solid performance as the very creepy government agent.  Paul Bettany is a real scene stealer as Nash's roommate and confidant.  The score is simply beautiful and sets the proper mood at all times.  The film is visually stunning.  I can't see how this film won't snag Academy Award nominations all around, but especially for Russell Crowe and for Jennifer Connelly. Crowe should definitely take home another Oscar for this one!  Please!  Do yourself a favor and see this film if you haven't already...and if you have then see it again - I just did!",
925,25 December 2001,dannyboy43,10, The Viewer becomes schizophrenic ... amazing directing...,"Without giving anything away, I was amazed at Ron Howard's film technique to out Hitchcock, Hitchcock!  The viewer becomes highly, intimately involved with the lead character's condition by seeing what John Forbes Nash sees -unknowingly at first then surprisingly and brilliantly revealed without being tricked or melodramatic. The early treatment of mental illness, in this case schizophrenia, is graphically presented and portrayed, encompassing all the victims-both the person affected and the family/friends dealing with their loved one.  It is not preachy, yet it teaches as much  as any book or informative lecture(s).",
926,13 December 2003,criptonix,10, Spectacular.,"A Beautiful Mind is based on Sylvia Nasar's 1998 biography of Nobel Prize winner John Forbes Nash Jr., but it is not another biography on film.  The film states before the credits roll, ""....The Nobel Prize winner John Forbes Nash Jr. still teaches at Princeton, and walks to campus every day..."" but it leaves out facts that would have made Nash more human and vulnerable, like his being a bisexual in his 20s, his having sired his first child by a mistress, Alicia's divorcing him and their subsequent remarriage, etc. The Nash that comes out of this carefully recrafted biography is a romanticized figure arousing sympathy, an awe-inspiring victim-turned-victor; in short, a hero. But never mind.  One shouldn't expect moviemakers to gamble millions of dollars on an honest portrayal of one man's life, even if he were a genius who has been compared to Darwin, Mendel and Newton.  Let's just look at A Beautiful Mind, the movie, and size up Crowe instead of judging Nash. Crowe does a superb job of playing this tormented paranoid of a genius: his odd gestures, facial twitches, erratic glances, loping walk and his convulsions under insulin shock therapy all combine to wow the viewer anew with Crowe's acting prowess-especially when you recall the picture of invincibility and immortality the actor projected as the (Oscar-winning) hero in The Gladiator.   Indeed, it is Crowe who carries the movie from beginning to end, ably spurred by fine co-actors. That A Beautiful Mind won the Best Picture in the recent Golden Globe Awards-with Crowe as Best Actor and Connelly as Best Supporting Actress-is saying much about the technical excellence of the film.",

Well, on second thought, it is and it isn't. Russell Crow has positioned himself for another Best Actor nomination. The only disappointing aspect of this movie was that we do not really get a true understanding for John Nash's genius. The movie would have been more complete if we knew why John Nash won a scholorship to Princeton, and more detail as to why he won the Nobel Prize. With that aside, however, this was an excellent film. The acting is superb and once you leave the theater, it makes for great conversation.

The depiction of either ""the creative process"" or schizophrenia is very far from what they are in any reality that I am familiar with (I am not very well familiar with schizophrenia but I've seen crazy people and science is close to me). There is no drama in John Nash's disease. All of it seems like a normal life but with a few extra people appearing to the main hero that nobody else seem to notice. The depiction of drama that followed is very sketchy at best with several decades of his life compressed into just a few minutes.

941,19 January 2004,Skiitifucan,7, Russell Crow is indeed amazeing,"**********************SPOLIERS****************** I had to right this paper for school about Schizophrenia and since i love this site i decided to submit. The movie, A Beautiful Mind, deals with the difficulty of living with schizophrenia. John Nash is a schizophrenic who attends Princeton University and is able to solve math problems that baffle even the greatest minds. Right from the beginning we noticed that social interaction is extremely tough for John. When John has to make conversation with other people we realize some of the first symptoms with his disorganized speech and disorganized thoughts and behavior. Throughout the movie we continue to notice he has much difficulty talk with others except when with one person. When John is with his `roommate' Charles we notice that all trouble talking and thinking is eliminated. From there we might understand that Charles isn't real and just a figment of the imagination. Later on when schizophrenic images have driven John to the edge Dr. Rosen confronts him at a math speech John is giving. Dr. Rosen gives John shock therapy and we see John having convulsions while strapped down on a medical bed. Besides the shock therapy Rosen also gives John a heavy dose of medicine and asks Alicia Nash, John's wife, to watch out for him. Dr. Rosen also has to face the hardest part of telling John that people he thinks he knows are not real. John has a tough time getting a grip on reality and sometimes can't even turn to his wife. During a schizophrenic episode while attempting to knock away `William Parcher's gun' pointed to his wife but instead hits his wife. This and John's forgetfulness with his baby so how hard it can be to care for someone with schizophrenia. With these two episodes Alicia even has to move out until John can understand what is real and what is not. A moment occurs when John comes to grips with reality with himself and tells Alicia that he knows that the images are not real. He says that Becky never got any older the images are not real. From this point we know John we fight these illusions until he is `better.' During the movie we become attached to his illusions and just as it is for John it is tough for us to let them go. Near the end John tells us when he is asked if the illusions are still there, he says that they are never gone I just don't answer them. Unfortunately at this time that's all that could be done. In the end John has triumphed in the biggest way, he has put the images out of his mind and wins the Nobel Peace prize. He then gives an emotional speech crediting everything that he has done to his wife, and rightfully so. What makes this so much more realistic is that it is.",

As a person, I do not particularly care for Russell Crowe. The whole hoopla behind the Academy might have done him in for an award, but nevertheless, Crowe shines as John Forbes Nash, Jr. in ""Mind"". His performance was that of how the old times in cinema used to be--very in touch with their characters, and flawless in their performances. Russell Crowe is comparable to Tony Curtis's portrayal of Albert De Salvo in Richard Fleischer's ""The Boston Strangler"". Although they are complete different performances, Crowe delivers his with the same impact of Tony Curtis's character. Mr. Crowe was phenomenal, and to my wishes, was not overlooked by the Academy but simply given a close race against Denzel Washington. Many people disagreed with Nash's schizophrenia not being unveiled until the middle of the film, and I will admit that it was upsetting to me, but the good aspects of this film really overshadowed the slight flaws of dislike within the movie. I was more disappointed that Nash was not in fact doing all these things for the government and aiding us at the times of the Cold War. However, Nash's true genius made up for this factor and allowed the viewer to see that he truly was a genius but just one that simply had to overcome an obstacle that was so slight compared to the intelligence he possessed.",

Not only can he play a ruthless by vengeance driven gladiator or a brutal cop, but he also delivers as a brilliant but asocial mathematician. He's not an actor, who turns everything he touches into gold, but he shines in a handful amazing movies. A Beautiful Mind has a great plot, where half of the time I don't even no what to think or believe. At times the movie grabs you by the throat and it doesn't let go. It's really intense. It's such a sad film also, and you sympathize with both main characters. The beautiful Jennifer Connelly plays Russell Crowe's wife and she shows so much loyalty, but on the other hand, she doesn't have much of a choice. She can't leave someone in that state. Hopefully this doesn't spoil to much. They are of course adopted from a real story, and maybe that's why they're such deep and well written characters. Jennifer Connelly did such an amazing job performing in this movie. While watching it, I thought to myself that she should have won an Oscar for it, to later find out she actually did. Ron Howard won the Oscar for best Director. He did a really great job and it's well deserved. I especially like the soundtrack. He uses such calm background music and it fits perfectly.

Although I didn't agree with last year's oscarwinning role in Gladiator, I do believe that A Beautiful Mind gives Crowe the stage where he shows his acting ability to the highest level seen in recent years.

The film claims that a scrambled mind can use that scrambled mind to unscramble it with the support and love of a good woman. It's an inexcusable lie, and irresponsible with respect to the truly horrific reality of schizophrenia. The film picked the perfect formula: take a real man's story, strip away everything but his name, pretend to deal with a deep issue (like mental illness), alter it to make it more palatable to mainstream audiences, slap on a happy ending, and open your arms for a slew of awards.

In my mind, he should definitely win another Academy Award. If you don't particularly like Russell Crowe, see this movie anyway, if only for the performances of the many other great actors that appear. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Paul Bettany, who was one of the saving graces of A Knight's Tale. His performance was particularly convincing and realistic. I was expecting a good movie and it was better than good.

He was fine for a while but the imaginary people comes back after he stops taking the pills. It not only distracts him but also threatens his relationship with his family.

He has a delightful family and he's also a professor at Princeton University. The last phase is him finally getting paid off with his hard work in his specialty and winning the noble prize.

Although Crowe did a good job overall, his West Virginia accent was very poor and at times he lapsed back into his native Kiwi accent.  Many times he attempted to cover his poor accent by mumbling his lines. Denzel Washington definitely deserved to win the Oscar over Crowe.

This movie can almost be considered a low budget, or independent film. Russell Crowe delivers an Oscar caliber performance as the tortured Nash; head and shoulders above his Gladiator role. Crowe gives in completely to the Nash character. Jennifer Conelly is excellent as Nashs wife Alicia. The last I saw her she was flaunting for the camera in ""Inventing the Abbotts."" Her performance is also Oscar worthy. Hopefully, this part will lead to more roles.

This movie makes you believe in something. There is a possibility, that single man like you or like me could describe a whole world, but when it comes to real life nothing can help you more than understanding and support of your closest people. You will see, that John Nash is a genius, who develops something new, and gives whole himself to the problem. He is the man, who can find a  solution to this hard equilibrium. And this equilibrium is life. Sometimes it might be hard to understand the life. Who can tell you what is right or what is wrong, who can define what is real or what is not? We come to this point where only dedicated group of people can tell you what is right. These are psychiatrists. Group of people who decides whether human is normal or not. John Nash really had some trouble with himself, but this also helped him to       create his theory. Before this Dr. Rosen we think that everything what is happening around is hundred percent real. And this Doctor is just another person who disturbs John's work and life, but suddenly we realize, that John might need help anyway. At early stage of it it is seen that it is really hard for him to get along with himself and his wife. I would also like to highlight their relationship. Alicia is love with John forever and she will help him at any cost. Love is real John understood this words in its full meaning. His eyes told everything he really needed help, but not clinical just a little social. His wife was the only man on Earth who could help him and it is the only man who can understand him. Finally i would like to say that when something is right it will be right forever. And John Nash knew that he was right, and this helped him to do, what he believed had to be done. I have to tell that this is one of the greatest movie i have ever seen.",

Hollywood has long depicted schizophrenia as a multiple personality disorder which is horrible misinformation and not even close, but thats what everybody thinks it is, from tv and movies. Caution this is a very sad movie, and a suspense thriller at times as well, with comedic parts mixed in. But foremost it is a very sad movie, even sadder for myself, 21 and have struggling with schizophrenia for a while now. It was like the whole movie was about me and i cried harder than i have in a long time.

You might say that to high for Russell Crowe but I say not. You had to see him five times to detect his all the theatrical tricks and see the artistry of a real genius. For in art and in literature, as it is, yes, in sports, it's the difference that really counts. In The Gladiator, Russell Crowe was all hunk and is ready to kill or die anytime, giving his life for the justice. He was all the raw rippling power of a professional warrior, all that a man could ever want to be. He fears neither man nor beast. Filled with faith for God and Country. In The Beautiful Mind, Russell Crowe was the unlikely nerd in college, sexy professor, and - lo and behold! an old man-Crowe as John Nash.  A mathematical genius trapped in the wild world of schizophrenia, and the gladiator had completely disappeared. It brought me to tears and had the theater applauding at the end.

A Beautiful Mind is a phenomenal movie about the unexpected turns our lives can sometimes take.  It's a story of a man any one of us would envy; living a life that would be our worst nightmare. Nash makes an astonishing discovery in graduate school and stand on the brink of distinction. Instead, the handsome and arrogant Nash finds himself on a painful and mind wrenching journey.

I have seen ""A Beautiful Mind"" twice already and was mind boggled by the power and quality of Russell Crowe's portrayal of the brilliant and troubled John Nash Jr. His performance ranks right up there with the other performers who portrayed troubled or disabled individuals, most notably Jack Nicholson in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man"", Robert De Niro in ""Awakenings"", Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump"" and Al Pacino in ""Scent of a Woman"". Ron Howard's direction is superb, blending acting talents by not packing a lot of superstar punch into this film but by unleashing the power from his lead character and supporting figures. The movie is very-well made, extremely touching and very rewarding in the end. This is the best movie I have seen since ""Braveheart"" and I certainly hope it will grab awards for acting, directing, and best picture of the year.  9/10",

This movie reminds me much of forrest Gump which was an original movie about a mentally Challanged Country boy, who happened to be in the right place in the right time and achieved greatness although he's quite a moronic figure. The Creators of ""A Beautiful Mind"" used the same concept in this movie, a schizofrenic college student who overcomes his illness and becomes a nobel prize winner, and as you can see it's similar to the forrest gump story. that's why i give this movie only 9/10 1 point less for the originality, and everything else...brilliant! the cast was very good and the performance of russel crow was great. to conclude this pointless note i'm writing, i must recommend this movie to everyone who liked forrest gump, because you'll like it to.",

1039,21 February 2002,Dick Murchy,9, A Near Perfect Effort,"Ron Howard seems to be back in form with this nice movie. I even enjoyed Mr. Crowe whom I feel is an over rated actor. What has been troubling Mr. Howard's most recent movies is his temptation to paste them as American Pie slices of a generic visual experience. I didn't believe for a minute the cliche acting and directing in his Apollo 13 movie. But, here he seems to be back in true form more in touch with his early films like Parenthood and The Paper. If not for the sappy ending, this would be a perfect film. It is not the film that Lord of the Rings is or even The Man Who Wasn't There, but it will probably win best picture and Howard just may take in his first directing award. Too bad, because even though this is an excellant film, the awards should go to the best. Still, by all means everyone should see this film if not just for Mr. Crowe's performance and the story (a true one) in itself.",
1040,13 March 2002,Vthokiefb,10, This was the best movie I have ever seen.,"This movie should be nominated for the highest award available for the production industry.  Ron Howard did an excellent job on this film.  I have seen many great pictures in my 19 years, but 'A Beautiful Mind' is by far the best movie.  Its dealings with the reality of mental illness and its devastating effects on one's surroundings, family, and friends (and for that matter anyone close to the subject) are very accurate and seemingly brought into reality by Howard.  I feel that this movie has moved me in ways that no other movie has had the satisfaction of doing so.  I just think that the movie is a new look into the reality of the mental illness world and should make people aware that how they treat people really does matter in regards to their treatment, care, and healing.  In conclusion, 'A Beautiful Mind' has been a very moving movie to me and I feel it deserves the highest award available for it to possibly receive.",

Although the script 'skips' Nash's european period as well as softens some details of his life, it shows the world the bio of a man that wasn't such a celebrity but accomplished important goals.His theory opened new roads about taking life as a 'game' and that is not necessary to have a losing party when there is a confrontation.All the cast is fantastic(I have seen Mr. Hirsch and Mr. Plummer in Broadway and have admired them for many years)and each did an outstanding job.Mr Howard's direction shows his deep knowledge of the film crafting;  he is one of the top filmmakers of the past two decades.As you leave the cinema you are moved towards reflections about life, illness, love, companionship, science, and strength .I am seriously considering into seeing it again.

1049,6 April 2002,ekomi,10, This film changed my life,"I've  seen  '' A  Beautiful  Mind ''  three  times  in  a  week  and  I can say  that  I  have  never  experienced  so  strong  feelings  watching  a movie ! I  knew  almost  nothing  about  the  movie  before. I  thought  it  was  a typical  Hollywood  movie  and  I  don't  like  this  kind. But  as  the film  went  on  I  was  left  speechless. Russell  Crowe's  playing  was shattering. He  really  stole  the  performance ; in  the  movie  you  see nobody  else  but  him. I  have  seen people  suffering  from  mental illness  on  the  screen  before ( Shine, Ð etc ), but  it  is  the  first time  an  actor  gets  so  much  in  the  flesh  of  the  role, without resorting  to  hyperbolic and  easy  tricks. It  is  also  Ron  Howard that deserves  congratulations. The  atmosphere  of  the  film  is  unique, something  that  must  also  be  attributed  to  James  Horner's evocative music. I  don't  think  I'm  able  to  talk  more  about  the  movie  and Russell  Crowe's  playing ; I  just  say  that  watching  ''A  Beautiful Mind''  was  one  of  the  greatest  experiences  of  my life. I  have  watched  all  this  discussion  going  on, about  many  incidents in  John  Nash's  life  being  omitted  in  the  movie  and  about  others being  changed. I  don't  think  that  the  presentation  of  all  actual facts  in  Nash  life  ( homosexual  relationships, illegitimate  child etc ) would  make  any  difference. The  central  point  of  the  story  was  a man  with  remarkable  mental  abilities, who  struggled  to  distinguish himself, to  prove  he  was  extraordinary; and  that  due  to schizophrenia  this  extraordinary  man  was  almost  vanished, but  he fought  his  illness  and  finally  showed  his  worth. That  is  what  I saw  in  this  story  and  what  moved  me  so  much. As  far  as  the  theme  of  schizophrenia  is  concerned, I  think  that the  film  doesn't  say  exactly  that  John  Nash  quit  taking  his medication. Of  course, he  continued  having  hallucinations, but  this continued  until  the  end  of  the  film, when  he  said  he  was  taking a  new  medication.I  know  the  message  of  the  movie  is  that  John Nash  fought  schizophrenia  with  the  power  of  his  will ; but  I  also think  the  film, in  a  clever  way, leaves  the  story  a  bit ambiguous. ''A  Beautiful  Mind''  really  changed  my  life ; everyone  should  see it, so  that  they'll  see  their  life  change  too! E.Komi, Greece",

To think that we only use about 10% of our brains is sad in one aspect, that being what if we were to use 50% or 90% of our thinking potential where could we go? What could we do? But on a high note, now knowing what we do know, isn't a glorious thought that maybe we can try and find ways to tap into our minds? Imagine the rewards we could experience as humans, and what we could share w/ others.

Many films have been made with actors aging quite convincingly, but no 30-something-year-old has ever pulled off the aging process better.  Watch the scene where Russell is given the Nobel at Princeton.  As a man now in his seventies, his speech to the committee rep is masterful;  no contemporary actor commands the screen like Crowe.

It is safe to say that this is one of my favorite movies for many reasons. First of all, Russell Crowe gives an amazing and breath taking performance, but even more amazing than his performance was that of Jennifer Connelly. The chemistry between Connelly and Crowe was spectacular and believable, and contributed a lot to the greatness of the movie. It does not surprise me one bit that Connelly won the Oscar for best actress in a supporting role. She surely deserves it. I am slightly disappointed that Crowe did not win the Oscar for best actor. He portrayed John Nash perfectly from every emotion to every subtle movement, never over doing his part. The movie as a whole is a series of ups and downs. Your emotions will be thrown all around, and sometimes you'll just want to cry. The movie is brilliant and has a twist you would never see coming. After watching this movie I feel satisfied and as if I have just witnessed a masterpiece of the film world. A Beautiful Mind is just simply beautiful.This is no doubt, the best movie of 2002.",

I strongly suggest everyone who watched the movie read the original biography expedited by Sylvia Nasar, whom I thought of not a fellow mathematician herself but done a real deligent work through the insight of a genius's mind at work. In the biography, one will find more about his realistic academic work and his own schizoid reality preoccupying him for decades. For such a beautiful mind endowed by God to mankind, as human beings we should salute Mr. Nash for his achievements prospering modern world and as a scientist-to-be as I am, I wish I could access the marveled vision as Mr. Nash and contribute to the world. To sum up, this very movie is a great insperation for me! I wish someday I will be the one at the recieving end of the indulging applause!",

I watched ""A beautiful Mind"" for the first time now, after so many years of its release....and just mesmerized by the film especially by Russel Crowe's performance....Oh man, it never looks like he is acting....its like a character named John Nash is born in front of us..he lives the character with his moves, his each and every expressions, innocence, shyness etc etc so brilliantly....for instance when Sol says ""You know, John, you should go easy. There are other things besides, besides work..."" just look at Nash saying ""What are they?"" ....oh well I just fell in love with the character played by him....Love you russell.....hats off....",

Though it may move a bit slow at times, it helps set up different sequences later in the movie. I ended up watching this movie due to lack of sleep and it ended up being one of my favorites. A must see.",
1067,4 November 2003,redgypsy1969,10, Inspiring and Thought Provoking,"Unlike some, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It gave me much food for thought, as I was not familiar with the story of John Forbes Nash, Jr. prior.  It was an affirmation that the power and depth of the human mind and spirit are severely underestimated.  This movie made me laugh, made me cry, and finally made me appreciate the mere existence of this brilliant man. A Beautiful Mind was absolutely a deserving award winner.  I applaud Ron Howard for yet another magnificent release and I certainly believe that Russell Crowe did a wonderful job in his portrayal, as did Jennifer Connelly.   Bravo to all involved.",

Talk about Niagara Falls everytime they get to the pen scene where the older Nash gets the pens from the other faculty members...to the scene where Nash gets his award and makes his heart-warming speech about his wife, how she is the only reason that he is alive and standing there that day.  ""I have made the most important discovery of my career...the most important discovery of my life."" ""It is only in the mysterious equations of love, that any logic can be found."" ""I'm only here tonight because of you...you are the reason I am.""  ""You are all my reasons.""  ""Thank You!"" I think that about sums it all up.

1069,11 December 2011,dskodie,10, Great movie!,"I have seen A Beautiful Mind several times and I still love it just as much as the first time I viewed this film. Russell Crowe does a great job of playing the main character of John Nash. The title of this movie is very appropriate because the entire film is based on the way John Nash's mind works. You are led to think that the title is based on a man's mind and how truly brilliant he really is when it comes to being a mathematician. John Nash is on a quest to find a mathematical theorem which in itself is very interesting. In terms of the whole film, the title actually begins to take on a different meaning in the middle of the movie when the viewer discovers they have been witnessing a man that is ill. The reality that the viewer sees is actually the reality of a man with an illness. His wife in the film is Alicia Nash played by Jennifer Connelly who stands by her husband the entire movie. Parcher is one of John Nash's delusions and is played by Ed Harris. The theme of the film is more defined by the middle of the movie which showed that even though an illness was involved, John Nash still had a beautiful mind.",
1070,26 April 2004,mortenminke,8, A fantastic performance by Russell Crowe and a movie that takes a surprising development.,"After I'd just finished seeing this movie I was amazed. I had heard some very interesting things about it before I saw it, but the twists and turns that the movie takes, well, they capture you.  In my opinion ""A Beautiful Mind"" sucks you in and doesn't let go before the last surprising turn has been made. On top of the plot being absolutely gripping you have the performance by Russell Crowe.",
1071,4 May 2015,donnybee-339-394306,10, Amazing!,"I thought this film was absolutely brilliant, with all the actors fitting their roles perfectly. Crowe is phenomenal, you really see how hard it hurts him to find out although his mind is his best asset it is also his worst enemy. Seeing the struggle as he tries to fight it even though it's so hard is heartbreaking, and you see it's killing him to not be able to work as he wants to be recognised and have his own accomplishments. Supporting actors help pull the whole story together, Jennifer Connelly in particular I thought this was one of the best roles I've seen her in, she seems to embody the way the characters wife would feel if it was to happen to her, going through all these different emotions yet still wanting to stick by her husband through it all as it isn't his fault. Ed Harris is also a great supporting actor in this film, fitting the profile so well that you actually find it hard to believe it's all in Crowe's characters head. Many of the cast could have a mention. ",

It is so, because the story is real and you're sure that what you see is possible (and that it isn't such a thing like impossibility). However, even this film has got some flaws. I am quite in favor of  Crowe, but he is just too fit for professor. The film also makes me believe, that Nash got Nobel Prize for the discoveries he made after he became aware of his illness, I mistook. In fact film doesn't show us any recognition of the work Nesh made after becoming aware. This is not so good in my opinion.",

A great true-based story, excellent casting, and more. The movie shakes me to my foundation as it evolves. Its soundtrack is accompanying its motion frames as if it exactly knows about the underlying moments of sorrow and greatness this couple have been going through in their lifetime. Truly, what I interpret to be the inner core of the movie is that irrational thoughts and imaginations are the main keys to great discoveries. For any every-life concern there is an infinite number of solutions since life and the universe itself are non-linear systems. I recommend the viewers to search in the beautiful website of the movie and learn more about the real John Nash which is linked to the Nobel Prize website.",
1076,29 July 2012,ambernixon-435-830643,6, A Beautiful Mind is a story about a man coming to grips with the limitations of his mind.,"Russell Crowe, playing John Nash, makes the focus of the later part of his life trying to come up with a ""truly original idea"". As he attempts to achieve this process, we watch as he struggles with relationships and interactions with other people. Having limited social grace, in a notably prestigious school such as Princeton, serves to prove as almost rewarding considering his luck at catching the attention of women. This is most especially true as he meets a beautiful girl named Alicia, Jennifer Connelly, who turns out to be his new love interest. When Nash inadvertently becomes acquainted with a man named Parcher, played by Ed Harris, the reality lines become blurred as Nash struggles to figure out whom and what is real, and what is not. In watching A Beautiful Mind, one can see the common theme is to battling our own realities. Nash makes it truly his entire focus on strengthening and using his mind for realistic and meaningful purposes. In his attempt to develop ""a truly original idea"", he becomes engulfed in his own reality and is unaware that in fact he is displaying schizophrenic tendencies. Others are engulfed in their own realities as it took many years later for anyone to recognize his need for psychiatric assistance. Associated with these episodes you can see another storyline incorporated as viewers become aware of other's reaction to what is socially acceptable of the time. Although criticism and backlash may be less harsh than our current societal tendencies, Nash suffers from stigmas throughout the rest of the film. Each character faces their own reality, and deviation from what is thought to actually exist, to what actually exists. This film similarly relates to the movie, Fight Club, where an imagination of a counterpart and friend, alter the realities of many other individuals. When Nash suddenly becomes introduced to a young student Alicia, his social limitations serve him well by giving him an endearing and mystifying quality. As the film progresses you are drawn into his secret purpose of decoding cryptography. One becomes excited at his possible discovery and chance of leaving even more social woes behind in his rise to hero status. Ironically his very worst stigma, social awkwardness, is what saves his relationships and his life, but in doing so Nash makes difficult decisions about his treatment. Finally getting close to Alicia and securing their love, allowed someone to finally focus and see an unhindered view into Nash's mind. Crowe and Connelly give suburb performances when considering the emotional state in which they must become a part of. Crowes interpretation on one's reality breaking and social awkwardness is displayed brilliantly through his jerky movements, disheveled appearance, almost vacant eyes, and sometimes mumbling dialogue. Connelly's performance of a wife trying dutifully to support her husband makes one want to break down right along beside her. When she gets angry, becomes concerned, feels lonely, the viewer feels her emotions. Her downcast eyes and her posture begin to sag with the weight of her emotions. We feel her pain and hope for her to be strong for Nash, but also hope for her happiness and freedom of safety. Two techniques I viewed at associated well with the theme were lighting and angle. Lighting was very subdued, echoing the recesses of his mind. Nash constantly focuses on the task, the goal, not the excitement of the journey and other surroundings. Various times when Nash was in Alicia's company, you can understand the change of lighting to a brighter shade as he was happier, not trapped within the limitations of his mind, enjoying the moment. Angle was also very important to the film, as many times you can see how the camera follows him and his unusual actions, or the angle cuts to how someone is socially judging his actions. In addition, many of his earlier public scenes with his schizophrenic counterparts were filmed without his other peer's taking notice, so not only they but the viewer wasn't able to immediately establish anything was wrong. Regardless of whether one believes in the process of medicine to overcome your own realities, one can safely say the definition of reality is very different for every person.",

1079,4 December 2004,sully512000,7," Great movie, bad portrayal.","I thoroughly enjoyed A Beautiful Mind. In fact, I would recommend it to anyone, and I often do. But to say this is based on John Nash's life in any way other than the most remote doesn't stack up. The seemingly endless onslaught of love and support put forth by Alicia to present an eloquent story is just that, a story, with no truth to it. They made no mention to the fact that she divorced him almost 30 years prior to his winning of the Nobel Prize. Granted, she did eventually go back to him (they were remarried in 2001, 7 years after the Nobel Prize), but to portray her the way they did is just plain bad form. If you are going to say a movie is based on reality, make it somewhat realistic. Like I said, great movie, horrible portrayal of what REALLY happened.",

What's the title of the movie? A Beautiful Mind, not The Truth of Mathematics, it's a movie letting us know how the mind of some perosn such as John Narsh or whatever his name is, giving us in details his life from beginning and end of how much mathematics influenced and not just that but his job and most of all his wife Alicia. Before I watched the whole movie I wasn't interested, I saw parts and it seemed real boring and not good enough for me. But the first 20 minutes of the movie made me think about whether I should pause it and get a drink or just watch the whole movie and then get a drink because the storyline was so good and so interesting.

The resilience with which he faced schizophrenia while publishing outstanding works time and again then going on to win the ultimate Nobel prize simply mesmerizes me.This movie apart from shahrukh khan inspired me to take Economics as a subject and I haven't regretted any moment after that.Instead of the mundaneness attached to mathematics by many he gives an artistic value to it simply admirable. I love the way he asks what are the other things people do in their lives while giving a questioning look to his friend a fellow mathematician. Each and every scene so beautifully merges to the next and keeps the viewer thoroughly engaged. When asked he sums up the difference between genius and excellence beautifully saying ''a lot''. great performances and the effect just stays on with you.",
1082,23 February 2005,jasonempires,8, Good acting,"The most vital element of a film is the acting. Acting can make a film good or bad, especially for films in drama genre. ""A beautiful mind"" is a successful movie because of its fabulous acting. Russel Crowe acted as John Nash. His performance was excellent because he became the character. He shaped the characteristics, behavior and tragedy of John successfully through out the film. In the film, John is a pure genius who can solve problems that baffle most of the mathematicians. There is one scene in the university canteen where he discovers an essential idea of his 'Game Theory'. He brings the audiences into his world of mind with complicated thoughts and ideas. As I was watching the film, I could understand how brilliant that John is. But it does not mean that he is perfect. This arrogant young man faced the problem of schizophrenia. Russell Crowe performed as an insane person. John's life is tragic. I could feel the bitter he has tasted in his lifetime struggle, though he fends off his fate late in his life. After countless bitter, his contribution has been approved. I am relieved and I am proud of John. Jennifer Connelly acted as Alicia Nash. She shows mercy and love to John who is having a journey of self-discovery. For the most impressive part, I should mention the time when John disappoints Alicia again because of his failure to defeat his weakness. However, Alicia does not give up John. She grabbed his tightly and put it softly onto her chest. She also put her hand on his chest to show how deep she likes John and says, 'this is real' to bring him back to reality. Really touching.",

Now,i come to explain his character in this movie.A mathematician genius,who is surrounded by some jealous mates,who always try to humiliate him,but he never loses his temper except once or twice.He keeps on working with a great composure and proves his mettle.

1088,13 July 2005,yemiya,10, Looking through the window of the mind,"The film A Beautiful Mind shows that the human mind is capable of creating its own reality separate and apart from the physical reality. The film showed how a illusionary reality could exist parallel to the real reality. Russell Crowe played excellent portrayal of Dr. John Nash an award winning scholar and mathematician genius The story was based on a real life: and director Ron Howard did an excellent job in shooting the film. The movie was not about the life of Dr. John Nash"" but it was about his mind A Beautiful Mind is a must see I have not seen a movie like this one with so much passion in creating a sense of reality: but at the same time making an illusion appear real The movie was very powerful in bringing its point across to the viewers. I would recommend A Beautiful Mind as a study guide for psychology majors because it is a good discussion piece. This movie reminds me of a powerful drama based on a real life story that came out in 1977. The name of the movie was Sybil, directed by Daniel Petrie. A Beautiful Mind is about the human mind and inner conflict, it makes you think and want to know more about the mysteries of the human mind... John refused to allow his delusions to take control as he gained back control over his life. The delusions became powerless, but they stayed with him, always lurking, waiting and watching, in the shadows of his mind. In conclusion my overall appreciation for the film and the theme's importance to the film is how the story was portrayed; giving the viewers a real sense of what mental illness must have been like for John Nash. The film was entirely based on the concept of the power of the mind and how John became a prisoner of his own mind.",

Every time I watch this movie I think about how a scientist solves a problem that is beyond the reach of any ordinary people. The intellectual ability of John Nash is outstanding. The way he solved the problem of game theory is very effectively shown in the movie.The director gets full credit for depicting such a complex personality in such sensible manner.I personally recommend this movie to any one who has some interest in mathematical problems.It is surely a great piece of work,worth watching many times.

It was is I was reading a different story. The film ""A Beautiful Mind"" starring Russel Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris was a gripping real life story of Nobel Prize awarded mathematician John Nash and his out of the box way of solving problems and learning the greatest lesson of life. Director Ron Howard did an excellent job of selecting the right team to bring the story from book to screen in a way that would keep viewers inspired, intrigued and with the ending wanting to learn more about the real life of John Nash. Watching this film one time is not enough as there are many scenes and sequences packed with the building blocks that tell viewers how John Nash played by Russell Crowe how he went from an being normal to discovering his unique abilities. What's also inspiring John Nash's wife Alicia played by Jennifer Connelly and her undying dedication and loyalty through John's severe struggle of separating the real world from fantasy. William Parcher played by Ed Harris is a fooler in this film as we think he's one thing, but turns out to be another. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is one of those films that you will never get bored of watching as it's not only inspiring, but you may catch a detail that you didn't pick up the last time around. As mentioned before, watching the film and referencing the book was shocking as so many details were left out that it seemed I was reading a different story and John Nash was more complex than the movie portrayed, in which the film character was a very complicated person. What both the book and the film did accomplish in sync was telling a story of a genius who wanted to discover the complex answers and found the simple solution. A definite must own movie.",

This was the basic ""Hollywood"" view on people that have schizophrenia, even though Russell Crowe did a good job acting wise, there was a lot of information that wasn't told about John Nash, that would help the background of the movie, for instance that schizophrenia was shown in other family members, so it was genetic.

In it, John won Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory-- has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations.

1106,5 December 2005,sovmix,8, Superb representation of mental illness,"The film is a little flawed here and there to my mind, such as when he pushes the desk out of his window (with his imaginary friend) and it seems that any subsequent inquiries by the authorities do not alert him to the non-existence of his 'friend'. But things like this are just quibbles. The film draws the viewer into what appears to be a plausible 'World of Nash', only for the whole thing to unravel before our eyes, with the realisation that much of what we have seen is mere fantasy. The film is a superb depiction of a very much misunderstood condition and a finely-crafted plea for tolerance. To my mind, the most moving part was the Nobel man deftly steering him into the tea rooms and Nash being presented with pens by his associates. I would never have watched this sort of film if I hadn't been talked into by my son. He's 16. I'm 53.",

1109,28 February 2006,hisservantever,10, How common is John's disease?,"No, I don't want to start a research on it from a psychiatrist's point of view, I just want to share that after watching ""A Beautiful mind"" I felt like ""Hey, this happens to every one in this world!""; I mean not all of us see a Parcher or a Charles, but all of us, at least once in our lives had thoughts about something or someone that influenced or could influence the 'normal flow' of the events that our lives consists of in a similar way some 'life-time fake friends' could do... And as John had to learn so hard that he has to just ignore them, we can learn that by ignoring those thoughts or let's say, making sure that they are true, our life can be lived easier... Does it make sense? I felt it is so true for me that I decided to share it... I hope somebody else will also consider it true :)",
