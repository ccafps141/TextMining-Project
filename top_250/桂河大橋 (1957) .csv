0,1 June 2006,EUyeshima,10, Still Stirring Wartime Adventure and Compelling Psychological Drama Exhibit David Lean at His Peak,"After years of more intimate British films and just discovering the joys of location shooting with 1955's ""Summertime"", master director David Lean made his first actual widescreen epic with 1957's ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", an acknowledged classic that deserves attention from a new generation of viewers and another visit from the rest of us who love perfectly executed films by an unparalleled craftsman. Recently, this movie has been overshadowed by his 1962 follow-up epic, the comparatively more elaborate ""Lawrence of Arabia"", but this richly textured WWII-set adventure is special enough on its own terms. While it has its share of action and suspense presented in exacting detail, the film is even more resonant as a psychological drama about the test of wills between mission-driven officers amid the perils of wartime survival.",/
1,9 June 2001,jhclues,10, The Definitive Guinness Performance,"Within the Conflict that was World War II, there were many more smaller, more personal conflicts which, when added up, made a significant impact on the outcome of the War; though trying to explain them, or war in general, is like attempting to decipher the indecipherable.  In `The Bridge On the River Kwai,' director David Lean takes you deep into the Burmese jungle to examine some of these deeper conflicts, and the effects of extraordinary circumstances on some ordinary men:  British Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) is a man of rigid principles and ideals, to whom acquiescence in any quarter is not an option; Japanese Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) lives by an inflexible code of conduct and is adamant in his adherence to it, through which he maintains his dignity and honor; American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden) just wants to make it through the war alive and get back home.

2,19 February 1999,bat-5,10, They don't make movies like this anymore.,"I recently saw The Bridge on the River Kwai at the Cinerama Dome, and it was quite spectacular.  Unlike some of today's grand adventure films, you get to know the characters along with seeing great scenes of acting and cinematography.  Alec Guinness is at the top of his form as the single minded Colonel Nicholson.  The scene between Nicholson and Saito in Saito's hut is remarkable.  Nicholson still will not concede defeat, he even takes offense that other officers of different armies gave in and worked alongside the enlisted men.  Saito can't understand Nicholson's acceptance of his punishment, and it drives him crazy.  The film's plot has two stories that are beautifully intertwined.  Shears' return to the bridge is his only way to escape the bridge.  In the film's final act, the tension is turned up as the British commandos try to blow up the bridge, and a train, and only then does Nicholson realise what the bridge really is.  The Bridge on the River Kwai is one film that is hard to top, the only film able to do that is Lawrence of Arabia, both directed by the meticulous eye of David Lean.  One director who could put intimacy in epic circumstances.",e
3,10 May 2008,Steffi_P,9," ""This is not a game of cricket""","The Bridge on the River Kwai – David Lean's first epic, a genre he would later be associated with more than any other. Previously having made his mark as a director of deep and often psychological dramas, Lean's easy transition into bigger pictures reflects the change that was taking place in the genre itself, moving from the grandiose spectacle of De Mille et al, towards the ""intimate"" epic of the late 50s and early 60s.",v

A group of people must blow up a bridge, and this is the story of their quest ...  Actually, that DID serve as the premise for a film: it was called `Force Ten from Navarone', and it was dire.  Or how about this one: we see close up the brutalities of war. (Then we see them again.  Then we see some more of the brutalities of war. Then we see the credits.)  Or how about this: a humble American soldier, with the pragmatism native to his breed, rejects his superiors' highfalutin talk of honour and glory and asserts his basic humanity in trying to stay alive.  Or this one: we see English prisoners of war maintain their dignity in the face of Japanese brutality.",5
11,2 August 2009,moonspinner55,7," A clash of wills, principles, and egos amidst the madness of war...","British Army Colonel, captured along with his regimen by the Japanese on the island of Burma in 1943, refuses to abandon the rules of his government and build a railroad bridge across the Kwai river according to the plans of his mercurial Japanese counterpart, Colonel Saito. Saito, under orders from his superiors to have the bridge completed by a certain date, eventually yields to the Britisher's demands and construction gets under way, but a POW escapee from the American Navy has been recruited by British officials in nearby Ceylon to return to Burma and blow the bridge up. Complex clash of personalities, with Best Actor Oscar Winner Alec Guinness nimbly helping us to understand his character's motivations (he not only engineers the building of the bridge to aid the enemy, but helps construct a masterpiece--while underlings wonder if perhaps a temporary structure might have sufficed). To be engrossed by this Best Picture Academy Award winner is to eventually sympathize with Guinness' Colonel Nicholson, who figures it's better to build something worthwhile and long-lasting (even as a prisoner) than to do a sloppy job. David Lean (winner for Best Director) does some of his liveliest work behind the camera; opening the film carefully, like a good novel, he lays all these difficult, stubborn warriors on the table and allows us to get close to each one. That said, the big climactic finish--while suspenseful--is ultimately a let-down. Lean's staging is sufficient...perhaps the editing is at fault? Throwing out the people we've come to know so intimately for the sake of rousing visual action leaves a sour taste behind. Yes, it is the madness of war to finish with no winners, only losers; however, the way it plays out here feels half-hearted, and a line of dialogue from Jack Hawkins' Major Warden adds a curious layer of dissatisfaction and confusion. Pierre Boulle was also awarded an Oscar for adapting his own novel (he was fronting for blacklisted screenwriters Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson); Jack Hildyard won for his cinematography, Malcolm Arnold for his commanding music, and Peter Taylor for his (rather spotty) editing. *** from ****",3

15,31 March 2006,Hitchcoc,9, It Doesn't Have to Be Historically Accurate,"To criticize movies for historical inaccuracy is to damn almost every work of historical fiction. First of all, the people who were there were not involved in the production. Secondly, if movies were truly historically accurate, they would be so dull, you couldn't watch them. To start with, this is based on a work of fiction. It is an idealized version of an event that took place some time in the past. It's characters are fictionalized. We don't know what they said or really did. Some were probably combinations of two or three different characters. Also, the criticism that people wouldn't make deals with the enemy is pretty naive. Sometime the deal making is what keeps you alive and gives you a chance to fight another day. It's easy to say that one would do or not do something, sitting on a couch in a living room. It doesn't reflect badly on soldiers in war time to be afraid, and, yes, seemingly traitorous. ",6

Sometimes, I think that 1957 gets forgotten as being one of the great years of films and that's a shame. BRIDGE won Best Picture in this year, one of the very few in film history that I think is at least deserving. That said, PATHS OF GLORY is amongst the top 10 films of all time as far as I'm concerned, but I don't think it was released immediately in the U.S. in 1957, so I can forgive the Academy that one!",e
21,3 May 2000,yenlo,9, Historically inaccurate but great film.,While this film is loaded with historical inaccuracies it nonetheless remains a great motion picture.  Many fine performances and the dual story line make it the picture that it is.  However don't view it for historic purposes.  The true story of the bridge and railway built by POW's is more brutal and horrifying than what is presented here.  The History Channel has an excellent presentation about the actual story.   By all means watch this film but don't pass up learning the real story.,f
22,21 May 2002,Theo Robertson,8, One Serious Flaw,"Rightly BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is considered a classic of cinema , it`s well made , well directed and most of all well acted by the cast , but this doesn`t stop a major problem with the script from nearly wrecking the whole film and it`s this : The imperial Japanese committed the worst crimes against humanity in the whole 20th century . Of course they weren`t alone Hitler , Stalin , Mao , Pol Pot et al murdered millions upon millions of innocents and for that their can be no excuse , they have the blood of countless people on their hands , but these unreasonable murders were committed for the reason of utopian idealogy . Imperial Japanese barbarity had little if any idealogy behind it . Defeated armies and civilian prisoners were treated as cowardly "" Untermenschen "" to be treated with the utmost inhuman contempt and without mercy . As many as ten million Chinese died at the hands of the Japanese and millions of more Asians died across Asia during the Nipponese occupation . And it`s this rewriting of history in order to bring about a dramatic story that comes close to destroying the film . Nicholson stands up to his captors and refuses to be broken by them . Very dramatic ( Helped no end by Sir Alec`s performance . Perhaps the greatest actor of all time ) but in reality Nicholson would have been tied to a stake and left to starve to death . In fact Nicholson wouldn`t have had to show any defiance it was very common for Japanese guards to use prisoners for live bayonet practice just for the sheer hell of it . I take it because it was made  during the cold war that Hollywood tried to rehabilitate both Germany and Japan by showing them in a less cruel light , but whatever the reason it is rather annoying to see prisoners holding concert parties in a Japanese POW camp . So treat this film as a drama not as a history lesson . For the record the real bridge was bombed by the American airforce",_

It's a lengthy and slow-paced affair that plays out as a character piece for the much of time, which makes it quite engrossing; Alec Guinness in particular plays a really interesting and morally complex character, although Holden's is easier (and easier to like).

The story itself, originally written by none other than noted French writer Pierre Boulle, who wrote the book, Planet of the Apes, was pleased with the finished project. The story is very loosely based on the actual construction endeavor, called building the Kwai bridge, is herein incorporated to include the British prisoner of war camp, run by the Japanese during World War Two. A culturally traditional, hard-nose commandant, one Col. Saito (internationally acclaimed Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa) has been given the task of constructing a railroad bridge over the river Kwai and is further ordered to have it completed by a given date. Failure is not an option. To his camp arrives an equally stubborn and somewhat arrogant British officer, one Col. Nicholson, (Alec Guinness) with several hundred POW soldiers. Already in the camp is a small detachment of American and allied soldiers who have been assailed and threatened to build the bridge. Among them is, Commander Shears (William Holden) an American POW who manages to escape the hell hole and makes it safely to a British base. Though Saito and Nicholson begin a battle of wits as to who is in command of the camp and its men, Shears is confronted by another British officer, Maj. Warden (Jack Hawkings) who asks him to return to the site of the bridge, to help him blow it up! James Donald plays Maj. Clipton, a British medical officer who watches as the various conflicting officers strive to give logic to insane goals. Every audience who views this movie, has to decided for themselves who among the officers, makes any sense to a mad-cap project. The film should be a testament to the insanity of every war. ****",r

Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) is the highest ranking British officer who leads his men into the camp. He insists on maintaining the Geneva Conventions and refuses to entertain escape. Saito orders the prisoner to build a bridge. It's a struggle between Saito and Nicholson for his limited control about whether officers can be forced to do manual labor. The bridge building is not going well with the men working half-heartedly and sabotage. Finally Saito agrees to give Nicholson command as he task his men to build the best bridge possible. Meanwhile Shears manages to escape the camp. He is blackmailed to guide a demolition squad back to blow up the bridge.,v

Unlike those other movies, this particular film is a provocative film that asks complex questions, but doesn't answer them easily. It is all up to the audience to believe what happened and why it happened. Of course, everyone may have different opinions and the movie seems to ask for that. Usually in war movies, they are concerned about the bigger picture such as who wins or who loses, which is all very fair questions. But the reason this film works more than most war films is because it poses questions that are deeper than the winner or loser. The movie talks about individualism. It's not all about who wins or loses the war, but who is in that war and how does war affect the individual.",

This movie isn't as fast paced as more modern war films like ""Saving Private Ryan"", and I'd argue Lean's later film ""Lawrence of Arabia"", is still better than this, and more epic too. But this is a film that is truly epic, and it has enchanted people for generations.

36,27 January 2007,Quinoa1984,10," one of the quintessential POW/WW2 movies, with unforgettable characterizations","What does it mean to be a solider versus a prisoner? How about the meaning of a Colonel's duty, pride, and everything in a male-centric view in times of war? And really, what everything seems to come down to- in the case of The Bridge on the River Kwai- is that priorities end up being eschewed with moral ambiguity and heroism in the oddest circumstances. David's Lean's masterpiece takes a compelling look at men who wont give in, and when they do they somehow lose a piece of themselves in the process- a big part really depending on point of view &/or country- and how being ultra-tough and stubborn and headstrong may get you killed for the wrong reasons. Colonel Nicholson (Sir Alec Guiness in a very well deserved Oscar winning turn) and Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa, who is actually a really great actor as well) both don't want to give in when Nicholson arrives at Saito's camp, and refuses adamantly to work alongside the fellow soldiers on the bridge- he sees it's against the Geneva conventions, and makes it a point of principle not to do it. He's put away for a while, but then finally Saito can't take the stubbornness any more- as he knows he's been evenly matched perhaps- and has no choice (ala seppuku if not achieved) but to let him direct the building of the bridge. But what this turns into for Nicholson, as a further elongation of the principle of the matter for his men and the situation, into a really mad situation.",

Shot on location in the jungles of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), the film concerns the building of a railway bridge by Allied prisoners-of-war during World War Two. As it becomes less and less likely that the bridge will be constructed before the deadline, conflict escalates between the proud British leader, Col. Nicholson (Alec Guinness) and hot-tempered Col.

The story is compelling enough, and the script is intelligent and beautifully written. While long, Bridge on the River Kwai never felt boring to me, while Lean's direction is faultless.

His films from the 1940's (""Oliver Twist"", ""Great Expectations"", etc.) up through 1984's ""A Passage to India"" are so cinematic that only a big screen can fulfill the viewer's need to see every single detail. ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is no exception to that, and from beginning to end in its moderate 160 minute running time, it becomes an epic of wartime that is so much more.

I always liked William Holden, but he's completely outclassed in Guiness' company. Jack Hawkins, who rarely got the credit he deserved, holds up his end pretty well. Critics usually put ""Lawrence"" and ""Zhivago"" ahead of ""Bridge"" on their all-time lists, and I don't quarrel with that. But ""Bridge"" ain't too shabby -- and, as noted above, it's a lot more fun. Although the outcome is predictable, I was on the edge of my seat the first time I saw this movie, and I find that it is still remarkably effective in generating suspense, even after you know what's coming.

It manages to portray the setting and the times unforgettably well, aided by some good music. Hayakawa is excellent, giving off a commanding performance as the Japanese general in charge. Despite its merits, the film still does have a number of vices. At times it is difficult to understand what is happening, and the film appears to be deficient in terms of providing the audience with background information. Also, the film is awfully overlong and none of the supporting characters (except for Hayakawa) are well developed. This is nonetheless a film that can be liked for its virtues insomuch as they over-weigh the film's vices  but they do not override the negative aspects of the film.

Just a great film showing the madness,brutality and inhumanity and futility of war. The theme of the movie can be summed up by the British Doctor at the end. When he says ""Madness Madness"".

75,6 June 2006,jboothmillard,9, The Bridge on the River Kwai,"From Oscar winning and Golden Globe nominated director David Lean (Brief Encounter, Great Expectations, Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago), the leading British actor and the ending are what most people remember best about this film, I'm glad I got a proper opinion on it watching it again. Basically, set during World War II, British POWs (Prisoners of War) have arrived at a Japanese prison camp in Burma. Commander of the camp, Colonel Saito (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sessue Hayakawa) informs all prisoners that, regardless of rank, are to work on the construction of a railway bridge over the River Kwai that will connect Bangkok and Rangoon. The senior British officer, Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Sir Alec Guinness) informs Saito that the Geneva Conventions state that captured officers are exempt from manual labour. Nicholson orders his officers to remain behind. Nicholson also forbids anyone from attempting to escape as survival in the surrounding jungles and other areas is considered unlikely. Saito threatens to have them shot, but Nicholson refuses to back down. British medical officer Major Clipton (James Donald) warns Saito there are too many witnesses for him to get away with murder. Saito punishes all the officers by forcing them to stand all day in the intense heat. That evening, the officers are placed in a punishment hut, while Nicholson is locked in an iron box. Meanwhile, three prisoners attempt to escape. Two of them are shot dead, but United States Navy Lieutenant Commander Shears (William Holden) manages to get away, although he is wounded. He wanders half-dead into a Siamese village, where he is nursed back to health before completing his escape downstream and eventually to the British colony of Ceylon. Meanwhile, the prisoners start work on the bridge, but do as little as possible and sabotage whatever they can. Saito has a deadline to meet and would be obliged to commit ritual suicide if it is not completed. Desperate, Saito finds an excuse to save face and announces a general amnesty, releasing Nicholson and his officers and exempting them from manual labour. After recovering, Nicholson inspects the work of the men, and is shocked by the poor job they have done. It is also clear the Japanese engineers have chosen a poor site, a part of the river with an unsteady bottomless surface. Nicholson believes they can do a much more professional job and is sure the bridge will later be used to transport troops and medical supplies. Despite protests from some of the men, the original construction is abandoned, and they begin to build a new bridge further downstream. Meanwhile, Shears is enjoying his stay in the hospital in Ceylon, when British Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) invites him to join a mission to destroy the bridge before it can be used by Japanese forces. Shears is so appalled he confesses he is not an officer; he impersonated one, expecting better treatment from the Japanese. Warden responds that he already knew and that the American Navy want him to join them to avoid embarrassment. Realising he has no choice, Shears ""volunteers"". Meanwhile, Nicholson drives his men hard to complete the bridge on time. He believes the construction is maintaining morale, and the completion of the bridge will exemplify the ingenuity and hard work of the British Army long after the war's end. The Japanese officers pitch in as well. Nicholson erects a sign commemorating the bridge's construction by the British Army. The commandos parachute in, one is killed, but Warden, Shears, and Canadian Lieutenant Joyce (Geoffrey Horne) reach the River Kwai in time with the assistance of Siamese women and their village chief, Khun Yai (M.R.B. Chakrabandhu). During the night, while the British and Japanese officers celebrate the completion of the bridge, Shears and Joyce plant explosives beneath the bridge under the water line. A train carrying important dignitaries and soldiers is scheduled to be the first to cross the bridge the following day, Warden waits to destroy both. However, the next morning, the water level has dropped, exposing the wire connecting the explosives to the detonator. Nicholson spots the wire and brings it to Saito's attention. Nicholson and Saito hurry down to the riverbank to investigate as the train approaches. Joyce, manning the detonator, breaks cover and stabs Saito to death. Nicholson yells for help, while attempting to stop Joyce from reaching the detonator. When Joyce is shot by Japanese fire, Shears swims across the river, but he shot himself. Recognising the dying Shears, Nicholson comes to his sense and exclaims, ""What have I done?"" As Nicholson runs towards the detonator, Warden fires a mortar, wounding the colonel. The dazed and wounded Nicholson stumbles towards the detonator, he dies and collapses on the plunger, just in time to blow up the bridge and send the train hurtling into the river below. Witnessing the carnage, Clipton shakes his head and says, ""Madness! ... Madness!"" Also starring André Morell as Colonel Green, Peter Williams as Captain Reeves, John Boxer as Major Hughes and Percy Herbert as Grogan. Guinness absolutely stands out with his superb performance as the very English, dignified, and patriotic colonel, Hayakawa is also memorable as the Japanese commander, and Lean deserved the Oscar for his direction. It is an interesting story, it has splendid locations and scenery, it is well written and well-acted, and the conclusion is one of the most iconic sequences in film, it is a little long, at 2 hours 40 minutes, but a fantastic war drama. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, and Best Music Score for Malcolm Arnold, it won the BAFTAs for Best British Film, Best Film from any Source, and Best British Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

76,18 November 2020,RonellSowes,9, An ageless classic,"From the title The Bridge On The River Kwai might sound like a film about a bridge,which it is,at least on the surface. However,the true point of the story lies in the characters and their personalities. On one side is Colonel Nicholson a man completely obsessed with ethics and his principles;someone who's willing to get himself and all others killed in order to follow his credo. But while he may act under the guise of principle or law or anything else,its really about his ego. Col Nicholson isn't really such a devotee of the law as he is a slave to his pride. The bridge is a manifestation of his pride,something not just constructed by wood and manual labor but the directive of Colnel Nicholson-something to be remembered so too. On the flip side is Shears. Self respect and morals mean nothing to him-only survival. While Nicholson seeks to preserve his dignity before his life, Shears would sacrifice it ten times over to survive. Major Clipton also perceives the situation the way Shears does but on the contrary Major Warden suffers from the Nicholson-syndrome.
The film is strongly aligned with Shears' mindset and though Nicholson carries his behavior to far it is not without it's own merit.",
77,1 June 2021,nickenchuggets,10," ""What have I done?""","Bridge On the River Kwai is one of the defining movies of the second world war in my view. It's a movie that doesn't often get a lot of respect, simply because it's over half a century old and countless other movies about the war have followed after it. Still, it sets itself apart in more ways that one. The setting is a good place to begin. The movie takes place in Burma (Myanmar today), where in real life, British forces became engaged in a long and bloody war against the forces of Imperial Japan. Burma was a truly horrible place to fight. Countless rivers that harbored mosquitos with malaria, dense jungles that took hours to cut through with machetes, and tropical storms that turned the battlefield into a quagmire. It's in this environment that we get introduced to our main character: Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness). Nicholson is being held captive along with other prisoners in a Japanese POW camp, and is treated horrifically by his captors. Men are beaten for not bowing to their jailers correctly, and stuffed into hot boxes made of corrugated metal for disobeying orders. Nicholson tells the japanese colonel in control of the camp that he, as an officer and gentleman, is supposed to be treated with dignity as per
the guidelines of the Geneva Convention, which protects prisoners of war from cruel punishment. The japanese refuse to look at it. Nicholson and his fellow prisoners are soon put to work making a bridge for the japanese to haul supplies over, but they intentionally screw up the work on it to make the progress go as slow as possible. Meanwhile, a group of men (one of which impersonates a Major) are on a mission in the jungle to blow up the bridge to prevent japanese soldiers from using it. The whole movie up until this point has been incredible. In one of the most frustrating and tense climaxes ever put to a motion picture, Colonel Nicholson notices the detonation wires connected to the explosives on the bridge that the men set the night before. He alerts the japanese colonel, and Nicholson finally realizes what's about to happen right before a japanese train shows up. The japanese colonel is stabbed to death by one of the commandos, and Nicholson is caught in the crossfire. Fatally wounded, he falls on the detonator for the explosives, and the bridge is wiped from existence. The train falls into the river below as well. Incredibly, they blew up a real train on a real bridge for this movie. I really liked this film because
it focuses on a theater of the war that doesn't get much attention, and Alec Guinness as Nicholson is excellent. Sessue Hayakawa as the japanese colonel Saito is also one of the best performances, since his acting really does make the audience hate him. He openly disregards the rules of civilized human beings early in the movie by torturing his prisoners, and then boasts about it. The movie is also directed by David Lean, who would later produce another masterpiece, Dr. Zhivago. The song the prisoners whistle in the beginning will also probably be remembered by all who watch this movie.",

Many times I have talked to people who entirely misunderstood the entire story, be it in the book or the film. They misconstrued it as an action film/story, looking only at the surface, and thought that the main characters were the guys going to blow up the bridge, or criticized the book for its ending (quite different from the film in one major respect that really doesn't impact either one negatively since both have value).",

91,21 September 2005,silverscreen888,8," An Allegorical Epic About Responsibility; Artful, Colorful, Very-Well Acted","Critics' failure to comprehend this film was due to postmodernism. The film is not about its individuals; it is an allegory about 3 groups, U.S. amateurs, exemplified by William Holden as Shears; the British Empire represented by Alec Guinness as Colonel Nicholson; and the Japanese Empire represented by Sessue Hayakawa as Colonel Saito. The titular bridge is the center of the symbolism. Shears wishes he were not at war at all--the bridge has no meaning to him; Nicholson in building the bridge performs an ""Elephant Walk"" ignoring of the situation; and Saito wants to build the bridge to show the British the Japanese are as good imperial dynasts as they are, and fails miserably. The film by my lights is long, but logically plotted. Characters are not developed, as in most males' films; but the central characters are given values, actions, reactions, speeches, purposes. The epic can be summed up in three sentences; ""A reluctant US warrior escapes from a Japanese prison camp just as newly-captured Brits led by a colonel arrive. He is forced to return, to blow up a bridge which the Brit, after refusing to allow involuntary work by officers on the bridge, has lovingly built, even recruiting his sick, wounded and dying men to show what British efficiency can do. The Japanese commandant was ready to kill himself if he failed to meet the bridge's deadline, so he reluctantly helps finish the bridge--which the U.S. soldiers and his team are sent to blow up, with the Brit's equally-reluctant eleventh-hour aid."" The central battle in the film is one of wills. Nicholson refuses to ignore the Geneva Convention and have his officers work on the bridge; he is thrown into ""The Oven"", a tin-box baking in the sun. Once released, he becomes the charismatic leader of his men. And wanting to show the superiority of British methods over Japanese, he and his team choose a new location and agree to finish the bridge on time. Saito accepts though this almost kills him to do so. And the efforts succeeds. There is a fine railway bridge, which Nicholson hopes future users will appreciate--he puts up a plaque saying British soldiers built it; but it's to be used by the enemy in WWII to send troop and ammunition trains through to kill British and American soldiers! So when a demolition team led by a commandeered Shears arrives and Nicholson discovers their goal, he suddenly realizes what he is--a totalitarian aiding an even more barbarous empire than his own, no better than they; so even shot and dying, he cries, ""What have I done"" and detonates explosives planted by the team whose other members have been killed. The final judgment on the entire bridge-building project--symbol of a ""bridge"" from the imperial past to a human future--is spoken by the camp's doctor, James Donald, who calls the entire affair, ""Madness, madness."" (Postmodernism--the ignoring of reality to construct a plausible or enforced alternative--the Japanese ordering Saito to be able to build a railroad using reluctant conscripts on a swift timetable was insane; the Colonel's agreeing to construct it after having opposed the concept of officers working on the project at gunpoint is insane; forcing a realist like Shears to die at gunpoint to have to prevent its building which he knew was a wrong project for either of the empires' representatives is insane. As the US soldier, William Holden is quite good. Alec Guinness as Colonel Nicholson and Sessue Haykawa as Saito are both award caliber, as is James Donald, the lone British realist, a doctor whose men are urged from hospital to labor at completing a bridge whose name should have been ""treason to humans' values"". Others in the large cast include Heather Sears, Percy Herbert, Jack Hawkins, Andre Morell, Geoffrey Horne, Peter Williams and many others. David Lean directed very artfully from a script by Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, developed from Pierre Boulle's French-language novel. Jack Hildyard's cinematography, Malcom Arnold's music (except for ""The Colonel Bogey"" March) used in several places, art direction by Donald M. Ashton all are first-rate. If as some note this is bad history,no one has problems following its points of view; given its modest and ironic source, author Boulle's distrust of human civilization in totalitarian hands (he also wrote ""Planet of the Apes""), the most admirable feature of the film is how much was made out of a sketchy narrative basis",

The casting is perfect and this is the best work of David Lean's great career. The irony of those who resist tyranny, which ironically makes war inevitable, is underscored by the subplot of a practical, cynical American, whose character must change in the midst of combat.

This film displays the absurdity of war, and the corresponding absurdities of humanity, and toys with the notion that the two are firmly linked.  Many may compare it to the more recent Saving Private Ryan, but the two films have completely different lessons.  Bridge is about the absurdity of war and the irrationality of those who fight, whereas Ryan is about the way in which brave men deal with the horrors of war, and the debt owed by all of us for their sacrifice.",

99,8 November 2009,zardoz-13,10, My All-Time Favorite War Movie!!!,"""Great Expectations"" director David Lean made what qualifies as the greatest World War II movie of all-time. I saw this fantastic film when Columbia Pictures released it, and the spectacle of an actual bridge being blown to smithereens with a real locomotive and freight cars on it captivated me at the tender age of four, and I have never forgotten it. I've seen it more times than I can remember, and this movie has never lost its allure for me. This stirring epic is based on Pierre Boulle's award-winning 1952 novel, but director David Lean and scenarists Michael Wilson of ""A Place in the Sun"" and Carl Foreman of ""High Noon"" took several liberties with the storyline. First, Boulle didn't obliterate the bridge. The British commandos were able to derail the train, but the bridge remained intact. Second, Colonel Nicholson discovered the sabotage, but he didn't collapse on the plunger and blow-up the bridge. Third, no Americans, specifically the character of Shears, appeared in the novel. Fourth, although there was a Shears, he was a British commando, but he tried to cross the river during the finale to kill Nicholson. Fifth, the British said that they had to send in commandos because the RAF couldn't fly the distance to bomb the bridge. In Boulle's novel, the British don't send in bombers because they felt the Japanese could repair any damage from bombing raids and have the bridge back in action. Nevertheless, this memorable film brims with irony and answers all the questions about life. This movie also immortalized the whistling march theme ""Colonel Bogey March."" Interestingly, former British POWs hated the movie and wanted to lambaste it, but they kept their silence for fear that their protests would provide more publicity for a movie that they felt deserved nothing in the way of publicity.",

Some of the fine details regarding honor and integrity between the main military characters were a bit much for the developing moral intelligence of a ten year old. On top of that, when the film finally came around to the ending, it was something of a puzzlement to me as everybody seemed to be getting along so well working out their differences and finally getting the Bridge completed in a spirit of cooperation approaching and nearly bordering on serenity.

Although I was disappointed with this latest viewing of the movie, I don't agree with these reviewers. The film is a work of fiction that is loosely based on a true, historical event, and that is how it is to be viewed. I recently watched ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", another film, much more to my liking, that is also centered on World War II but focused on an entirely different aspect of that war, the challenge that adjustment to civilian life poses to combat veterans in a world that is supposed to be peaceful but isn't. As in the case of this film, that product is a work of fiction based on true experience, but neither film was ever intended to be a factual documentary or a work of non-fiction. The actual combat disability of actor Harold Russell in ""Best Years of Our Lives"" is very real, but he doesn't portray himself or his own, personal story in the movie. In this case, no one is denying that Allied prisoners were treated much more harshly by their Japanese captors than depicted here or implying that the real colonel, upon whom the story is based, collaborated with the enemy as the fictional Colonel Nicholson did.",

108,11 March 2017,filipemanuelneto,9," What are the limits of pride, madness and opportunism?","This film is very lightly based on a true story of British prisoners of war who served in the construction of Indo-Chinese railways during World War II. Of course, the film (as well as, perhaps, the book on which it's based) takes a lot of creative liberties and isn't entirely stick to historical truth, which is normally bad but, in this case, is mitigated by the quality of the film itself. In fact, the film seeks to use this incident to portray the madness of war honor: on one hand, we have a Japanese officer who will have to commit suicide if he doesn't complete the bridge in required deadline; on the other side, a daring English colonel who literally wants to take all by the book and demands the military status of the prisoners respected by his captors. Both collide at first but then end up joining forces, in a way that we don't even realize what side the English are because their pride demands that the bridge be ready on time and be very good! Alec Guinness is the most notable actor, with a truly exceptional role and performance, but William Holden and Sessue Hayakawa also deserve applause for the way they stand. There are other actors who have been great but I highlight these by the psychological game of their characters. There is a lot of psychology in this movie and its merit of this trio. Cinematography is also good, with warm light and colors giving us the true feel of the infernal heat of rainforest. Another point I want to highlight is the costumes, especially prisoners.

122,15 May 2007,drystyx,9," Brings up historical accuracy question, but has some truths","By now, everyone has seen the History channel and knows there are flaws in the story. But are they major flaws or minor flaws? That said, there can be no doubt that this is a moving and great story. It centralizes on three characters mostly, and another three characters to a lesser degree. It loosely recounts the horrors of being a POW to the ruthless Japanese. The prisoners were forced to build a bridge under extremely harsh conditions. That statement doesn't begin to make a person feel the horror of the situation, and makes one feel as though it is whitewashed. This film, however, did little whitewashing. It begins with two prisoners explaining to the British officers that of all the hundreds of American and Australian prisoners who began the work, only these two were still alive. This pretty well explains it was horrible without going into details. The debate could go on about how far you make your actors go into portraying men who would be physically skeletons, but I feel that an audience can get the point without an actor forcing his body into severe hunger and malnutrition. Indeed, such an actor would be impossible to keep on his feet for retakes. The three main characters are the British colonel (Alec Guiness), a charismatic American rogue (William Holden) and the Japanese commander. A fourth player, Warren (Jack Hawknis) becomes a major catalyst with them, when he leads a small commando team to destroy the bridge. Most of the excitement comes from the commando team traipsing through a jungle. Two more characters serve as likable and identifiable observers (Joyce and the doctor). The story hops from the excitement of the jungle to the drama inside the prison camp. For most people, the jungle scenes will peak the most interest. But the drama in the camp is riveting for mature audiences. Guiness had the tougher role and was awarded the most acclaim, but Holden got the easier and most charismatic role, and gets the reward of being the most liked. There is a lot of sadness at the end. As a tragedy, this is a remarkable story. As a historical account, it doesn't deviate from the important things. It is probably accurate to compare real conditions in comparison, if not as completely true, with the major German camp movie STALAG 17 (also Holden) compared with BRIDGE OF THE RIVER KWAI. There is a line from the former movie in which Holden proclaims a reason not to escape the German camp is that you could get sent to Japan and wind up in a Japanese camp. Given a choice, an American POW would much prefer the harsh conditions of a German camp to the Hell of a Japanese camp.",

Saito insists that Nicholson order his men to build a bridge over the river Kwai, which will be used to transport Japanese munitions. Nicholson refuses, despite all the various ""persuasive"" devices at Saito's disposal. Finally, Nicholson agrees, not so much to cooperate with his captor as to provide a morale-boosting project for the military engineers under his command. The colonel will prove that, by building a better bridge than Saito's men could build, the British soldier is a superior being even when under the thumb of the enemy. As the bridge goes up, Nicholson becomes obsessed with completing it to perfection, eventually losing sight of the fact that it will benefit the Japanese. Meanwhile, American POW Shears (William Holden), having escaped from the camp, agrees to save himself from a court martial by leading a group of British soldiers back to the camp to destroy Nicholson's bridge.

The plot shifts focus, and concentrates on an escaped Prisoner Of War, who fled from the camp and becomes part of a team sent back in to go and blow up the bridge. Suddenly, during the part of his recovery at a military hospital, the screenplay injects quite a bit of humor (the conversation between Warden and his superior officers about him not receiving parachute-training was a wonderful highlight) and from then on, when their mission starts, the film gets much more exciting. It made me appreciate the first hour more for the establishing reasons it was used for, and also because - to my surprise - the shifting in tone and pace worked wonders.",

Anyway, The Bridge on the River Kwai is a good movie but lacks a little compared to those other movies of David Lean: the story just does not go deep enough, everything is a little too predictable, including the characters, also I was never really moved by the destiny of those prisoners of war - how different was it to witness the ordeal of Papillon! The strong suit of The Bridge on the River Kwai are the production and the cast - William Holden, Alec Guinness, Sessue Hayakawa and Jack Hawkings do well - with the material provided. What I don't like is the change of the ending - in the original novel (written by Pierre Boulle) the bridge survives - in my opinion a much stronger symbol of hope and of mankind's will to resist, to persevere against all odds, than blowing up the bridge. Verdict: no masterpiece but if you are in the mood for some classic mixing war, drama, adventure and some comedy, this one will be good enough.",

He temporarily loses his direction in this dilemma. Jack Hawkins, as a commando, has no such dilemma; for him, the war is a simple black and white choice. But for William Holden's character, an enlisted man posing as an officer, there once again is a moral question that must be answered; is it more important to be human, or should we subvert ourselves once again to the big picture (in this case, winning the war). The answer to that question has to be given by the person watching the film; many will have different opinions. The acting, however, is absolutely perfect, as is the direction and cinematography.

Explaining the first part of my comment, I think that we all have to bear in mind that movie making is a form of art, and as so, does not have to be a letter-perfect rendition of reality. Some literary licenses are not only allowed but expected. That said, my real problem comes from the adaptation of the book. Even if the scriptwriter won an Academy Award, the ending in the book is a lot more emotional. Probably it clashes with Hollywood's idea of happy endings, probably it was changed to show the actual destruction of the bridge instead of Coronel Nicholson's discovery of the charges and his subsequent successful stopping of the sabotage. I would have loved to see the real ending on the silver screen (or rather on TV since I was born more than 10 years after the film's release), but the adaptation was not totally faithful.",

181,26 June 2008,HelloTexas11,9, classic POW drama,"As with most war films utilizing a POW camp as the primary setting made prior to say, the 1970's, 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' leaves most viewers to speculate that conditions were in all likelihood many times more brutal than portrayed on the screen. Surely the Japanese had more devious methods of torture than simply having officers stand all day in the hot sun, or placing their commander in solitary confinement, as miserable as either of those situations may have been. And it is doubtful the Japanese commandant would have been talked out of shooting several prisoners simply because it is pointed out to him there might be an inquiry into the matter. Those matters aside, 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' is very compelling and believable, the story of a large group of British soldiers led by Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), and one American, Commander Shears (William Holden), being held in a desolate Japanese prison camp in southern Burma during WW2. At the center of the story is a battle of wills between Nicholson and the Japanese camp commander Saito (Sessue Hayakawa). Nicholson's defiance is genuine, but it is done in that peculiarly quirky British fashion which seems, especially in the film's latter sections, exaggerated to an almost unfathomable degree. When Nicholson finally agrees to build the bridge across the Kwai River that Saito wants built, he not only tackles the project with enthusiasm, he determines to build a better bridge than the Japanese themselves would have built. He doesn't regard what he's doing as traitorous; rather, he sees it as a way to keep his men busy and the bridge itself as a monument to their hard work while in captivity. One very interesting sidebar in the film is the contrast between Nicholson and Shears, and by implication, the British and American approach to war and life in captivity. Nicholson lives by certain codes and traditions and would rather die than violate them, even if they come to seem inexplicable in their practical results. Shears, on the other hand, is crafty and resourceful and doesn't give a damn about rules or regulations. He routinely bribes the guards to get out of performing physical labor. To him, the ends justify the means every time. He regards Nicholson and the other British officers as fools, and they regard him as a crazy American, gone slightly off his rocker from being a prisoner so long. Guinness gives one of his finest performances and deservedly won an Oscar (as did the movie itself, and the director, David Lean). The miserable conditions of the camp, and particularly the 'box' where Nicholson spends his solitary confinement, are very realistically presented; the unrelenting jungle heat is palpable. The characterizations are such that we are in sympathy with Colonel Nicholson, though we suspect he isn't completely rational, just as we come to dislike the character of Shears, even as we realize he is doing the right thing in blowing up the bridge. 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' is rightly regarded as a classic; I would say it is one of the ten best war movies ever made.",

183,28 February 2015,ianlouisiana,10," Nice bridge,Colonel,but there is a war on you know.......","I saw this at the cinema as a 17 year - old and was most impressed by the sheer size and sweep of the film - a characteristic,I later learned of most David Lean productions.Mr A.Guiness represented the bulldog spirit and unquestionable integrity of the British officer - class and the various jolly cockney,witty scouses,dour northeners in the ranks were typical of the portrayals of rank and file soldiery we had come to expect in just over a decade of obsession with the role of the armed forces in the second world war. Mr S.Hayakawa was eminently hissable as the evil Oriental who was eventually outwitted by our brave and stubborn Col.Nicholson. Nearly sixty years and many viewings later I have come to realise that ""Bridge on the River Kwai is still a hugely impressive film and Mr A.Guiness is even better than I first thought,but that my reading of the film was all wrong. Mr Lean has in fact borrowed deeply from Joseph Conrads""Heart of darkness""with a plot about a rogue officer with his own agenda running what is virtually his own private army in cahoots with the enemy to the extent that an assassin is sent on a mission to kill him. Col.Nicholson,in short,is as mad as a sack of weasels and his obsession with building the eponymous bridge,rather than giving his chaps something to do and improve their conditions,is considerably aiding the Japanese Imperial Forces and the movement of their troops. The last third of the film detailing the efforts of Mr J.Hawkins and Mr W.Holden to destroy the bridge is amongst Mr Leans's best work,taut, with beautifully conceived editing,and a wonderfully managed climax where Nicholson finally realises the blind alley his obsession has led him into. ""What have I done?""he asks as the first train is about to cross the bridge and he stumbles around on the sand seeing the explosives set by Mr Hawkin's commandos exposed by low tide. In ""Heart of darkness"",Kurtz's last words are ""The horror,the horror"". As the bridge finally blows up, Mr J.Donald mutters ""Madness,madness"",which isn't too far removed from that.

184,16 June 2016,PWNYCNY,10, A tragic story about men who die for nothing.,"The movie withstands the test of time, meaning that the story still resonates, decades after the movie's initial release. It depicts prisoners of war and deals with ethical issues that transcends time. A British commander deludes himself into believing that he is doing something good when in fact he is a shameless collaborationist who is selling out his country to satisfy his own vanity. Every member of the cast deliver excellent performances. That is especially true of Jack Hawkins and William Holden. Alec Guinness plays the Colonel. His performance is singularly impressive and iconic. He sets the standard for the depiction of the pompous and arrogant military officer type. The problem with the movie is its ending. It is too abrupt and given the Colonel's intense and deep emotional investment in the bridge, there is no way that he would suddenly realize the reprehensible nature of his actions. He is too deluded. But the movie redeems him, raising him to the level of a tragic figure, the good man who goes astray. The question is: was he really a good man?",

One of his more high-prolific entries into that category was the 1957 classic ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"". To me the top priority of this movie wasn't emphasized on World War II. The film centres around a strict, but well-defined British officer Col. Nicholson (Alec Guinness), a lesser disciplined American soldier Commander Shears (William Holden) and a tyrant prison officer Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) who were placed in a Japanese prison camp where they were forced into labour to build the railway bridge over the River Kwai that connects from Bangkok and Rangoon. While this is done these three individuals try everything to co-exist with one another. You see very little of the war. The abysmal conditions of the prison camp is hard to swallow and cruelty that comes with the package is not for the faint of heart.

199,6 October 2006,ALauff,10, Intersections,"One earmark of a great work is how strongly it defies easy classification. The Bridge on the River Kwai could reasonably be called a war picture, a P.O.W. escape picture, a dark farce, an examination of leadership, or a debunking of the Great Man theory of historythese would all be correct and also fall short of describing its essence. The film is about a proud, valorous colonel and his rival, the ruthless leader of the Burmese P.O.W. camp at which he and his troops are captive. As the story progresses, the division between hero and villain gives way to a more significant consideration: under such austere conditions, who will be able to navigate the messy intersection of personal and institutional codes of honor and conscience? At first, the deck is stacked for the colonel (played with conviction and inscrutable dignity by Alec Guinness), as in an early scene when he pulls out a copy of the Geneva Convention to prevent his officers from participating in construction of the eponymous bridge to India or when he's willing to sit in a tiny enclosure ominously named ""the oven"" without food or water to uphold his principles. Eventually, his unwavering integrity breaks Gen. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), whose great pride is exposed as he weeps solitarily at his failure. Providing further counterpoint is an American soldier (William Holden), whose code of pragmatic survival has kept him alive for many years in the camp, and who cautions Nicholson that they are miles away from a civilization that respects government dictates.",

The story is set during WWII and is about a group of British POWs who arrive at a Japanese labor camp in the Burmese jungle (modern-day Myanmar). They are tasked with building a bridge over the Kwai River, but initially have difficulty because the camp's commander Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) has a clash of wills with their own commander, Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guiness).

(Their patience will be rewarded: there is a mesmerizing sequence toward the end of a character's perspective that is all the more remarkable for being two tiny figures in a landscape.) There are some overly cinematic, artsy touches, like the incessant panning shots of screeching vampire bats during a Japanese ambush, that would be annoying if they didn't look so cool.

Alec Guinness won an Oscar for his portrayal of said leader, a determined military man who takes no quarter despite terrible punishment and still harbors the notion of brotherhood with his captors. Therein lies the moral conflict, as Guinness and his men develop a strained kinship with the Japanese officers while an escaped American works in secrecy to undermine the entire operation. Tricky waters to navigate, since we feel a mix of enthusiasm and reluctance for both perspectives. Everyone has a distinct, relatable motivation - even the seemingly-merciless captors - which makes this something much more than your usual yay-rah, blow 'em up wartime picture.

""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is outstanding in all departments. Based on a French novel by Pierre Boulle which in turn was a literary adaptation of a true story, director David Lean, with the able assistance of blacklisted screenwriters Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman, has fashioned a remarkable motion picture that shows, more than most at first realize, the senselessness and madness of war. Lean was also helped tremendously by Jack Hildyard's cinematography, making the jungles of Ceylon come alive for the camera. One telling scene that pinpoints the majesty of Lean and Hildyard's collaboration is when Cmdr. Shears (William Holden) is lost in the wilds while attempting to escape from the POW camp. A strange looking bird flopping overhead turns out to be a kite. The viewer's mind's eye is engulfed in Shear's plight when suddenly the camera pans to the kite, then shows an entire village with all indications of friendliness toward the lost soul.

Very surprising and suspenseful, even after seeing the movie about 8-9 times. Anyway, at that point, an entire platoon of Japanese begin running over to where Guiness and the commando are. My quibble is that except for one lone soldier, the rest of the troops all just disappear! One moment there's a whole battalion of men rushing towards and shooting at William Holden who's desperately swimming across the river to help blow up the bridge, and after that one lone Japanese soldier rushes him, misses and falls into the water, that's it! No more Japanese soldiers anywhere! They just all magically disappear which gives Guiness more than enough time to stagger, faint and fall on the plunger, blowing up the bridge. How convenient! In fact, EVERYBODY disappears at the very end with the exception of the one British officer who says ""Madness...Madness..."" It just gets me every time I see the film.

It shows two sides of many things. Take for example Colonel Nicholson. Colonel Nicholson is a savior to his fellow British soldiers, yet he can also be viewed as a traitor. Commander Shears who was a former prisoner at the camp, and later leads the attack on the bridge, was impersonating an officer. A court martial offense. But he also led the United States and the United Kingdom to victory by blowing up the bridge. Colonel Saito, who was the commandant of the prison camp, was a sadist and was a monster. But he was willing to make necessary compromises with Colonel Nicholson on the construction of the bridge. Anyway let's look at the plot. A new group of Royal Army soldiers have been captured by the Imperial Japanese Army and have been placed in a Japanese prison camp. In other words hell. Anyway the commandant Colonel Saito, and the commanding officer of the prisoners Colonel Nicholson, don't agree with each other. Saito wants all prisoners, including officers to work on a bridge that will connect from the island the camp is on to another island I think. But as this is against the Geneva Convention, Colonel Nicholson won't allow it. Saito retaliates by putting the British officers in confinement. And putting Colonel Nicholson in the oven. Meanwhile US sailor Commander Shears, who was already a prisoner at the camp escapes. When he makes it back to an allied base they give him a mission to blow up the bridge that the prisoners are working on. Colonel Nicholson eventually agrees to Saito's commands and officers work on the bridge as well. It end in a spectacular battle against the allied special forces, and the allied prisoners who seem to have forgotten their allegiance. I highly recommend this movie.",

Director David Lean really worked his heart out in order to make into an Oscar winning success which is why he won his first Oscar for directing this movie in the very first place. I would recommend this movie for all people that are into any period pieces like this one that will stay with you for a very long time.",
234,8 March 2004,unbend_5440,10, David Lean will never be replaced,"Another David Lean masterpiece (that's all he seems to make). I think in some ways this was the first great war Epic made. The great thing about David Lean epics is that he refuses to use cheap special effects or miniatures. Everything must be authentic in a Lean Epic. That included the construction, and destruction, of an actual full sized bridge. The only thing at all that dates this movie is the use of Day-For-Night, which looks very obvious by today's standards. Other than that, even on technical merits, Bridge On The River Kwai is one of the greatest movies of all time.",

238,8 February 2006,andersonenvy,6," Good story, but not for people with short attention spans.","WIth a great plot and well done performances for its era, TBOTRK is a fantastic view of one of the lesser known sides to WW2, the POWs on the Asian front. It's an exciting and often nail- biting look at life for British POWs building a bridge for the Japanse, and the true meaning of the term ""fog of war"". However, at over 160 min this film is not for people who want a quick fix. The horrific editing of this great film demands a lot of patience from the viewer. For instance, we are forced to watch a 10 minute cut of commandos placing mines on the bridge, a scene which could have easily been cut down to under 1 minute. The movie basically follows this pattern throughout, as long, drawn out scenes are constantly in the way of storyline. This film could have been cut down to under 90 mins and still had the same effect. Poor editing, but a great film if you have the patience.",
239,27 March 2021,douglasmcbroom,9," 'Da Duh, Da Da Da Duh Duh Duh'","Firstly, this film is not an anti-war film as many critics would like to appropriate, but rather a character study. Secondly, the entire concept of ""the futility of war,"" is ludicrous. In WWII, we freed Europe from the domination of an anti-Semitic brutal dictator and Asia from power-mad zealot. That's a pretty fruitful result. As for this film, it is a lot of fiction regarding the actual story upon which it was based. The Brits did not build willingly. There were two Bridges, not one. William Holden's character did not exist. And the allies did not blow up the bridge. That aside, TBOTRK is a brilliant character study and a tribute to British fortitude and tenacity. It is beautifully directed and filmed. Alec Guinness delivers his finest performance. William Holden is terrific. Sessue Hayakawa is brilliant as the sadistic 'Col. Saito'. It ranks as one of the Great War movies of all time. The film won 7 Oscars, including: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Guinness), Screenplay, Cinematography and Music. Hayakawa was nominated in a Supporting Role, but ironically lost to Red Buttons for 'Sayonara.'",

I loved the first half of the film, which is centered around the confrontation between the British Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) and the Japanese Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), both actors giving phenomenal performances. I also loved the second half of the film, which centers more on William Holden's character, Shears, as he leads a team of multinational commandos trying to destroy the bridge that the POWs are building and free them. The production is top notch, with themes of a soldier's duty and the meaning of honor and dignity. The ending is amazing too, one of the best endings of all time for a truly classic film.",

A screen adaptation of the novel of the same name by the French writer Pierre Boulle, based on real events that took place during the Second World War. The author of the book himself was a direct participant in those events, but I did not read the book itself, so I will evaluate the picture as an independent work. I learned about this film relatively recently, but agreed to view it only for the sake of the wonderful and charismatic actor William Holden and director David Lean, who will put on a real epic masterpiece of historical cinema ""Lawrence of Arabia"" a few years later. As a result, I looked - and the picture left an ambiguous impression, and here's my brief opinion - a Masterpiece or another revaluation? In this review I will try to arrange all my thoughts and conclusions, as they say, ""on the shelves."" I will highlight all the pros and cons of this picture. Now let me finish with the introduction and get down to the point.",
246,14 November 2009,johnmschofield,10, A very good film well worth watching,"This film is superbly well made and a credit to all the team that were involved in its creation. For me it hasn't got any obvious weaknesses and is well worth watching. I have only ever watched it about three times and the reason is although its subject matter is important and relevant I would never regard it as a film I would watch repeatedly over the years. Basically I see this film as more of a psychological drama than an action film and it seems to me to be a supreme study of multifarious emotions and states of mind under almost constant high levels of stress and danger. This description doesn't mean it will be automatically discarded and overlooked but perhaps seen in a different light, however there is something about this film which although a very good finished product has not resulted in many people voting or writing reviews. I can understand this to a certain extent because although it is a classic it is a very sad story and doesn't appear to leave the viewer with any positivity. Virtually nothing positive comes from War and this film is a perfect example of this. The film as a study of human behaviour under extreme circumstances it is a very fulfilling experience but I suspect it is not a film most people would grab for a night in with a beer. That is sad but such is the nature of the subject. Having said all of the above please watch this film not because it is historically accurate but because for me it is just over two and half hours of human interaction parts of which could have been extracted from any incident from any of the war torn parts during the duration of the second world war. It is a representation of the tragic possibilities of war and how logic and common sense are very rarely in evidence but horror, absurdities and suffering are there in abundance and a single viewing of this film would demonstrate this well",
247,8 September 2001,Zardok,9, excellent,"Bridge on the River Kwai is an excellent film. It succeeds where recently made movies like Thin Red Line failed: it shows the awful madness that is war without the blood and guts element, which, by the way, almost always misses the mark. War is insane not because of what it does to our bodies but because of what it does to our minds. Great performances from William Holden and Alec Guinness. Definitely worth seeing at least once.",

It's as if director David Lean needed to have William Holden in the movie for a long space of time if only to ensure box office success. Still, when it's on the right tracks, this really tugs at the heart. When Guinness realises his labour of love, the bridge, is about to be destroyed, only the coldest of hearts would feel nothing.",

257,24 October 2022,VikingBurialService,9, Engrossing War Epic with Slightly Odd Pacing,"Overall, an incredibly entertaining movie. Basically, british POWs build a bridge during WWII, while other british soldiers plan to destroy it. The acting/casting is absolutely fantastic; Alec Guiness and William Holden play two diametrically opposed types of soldiers, with each one coming to a melancholy, ironic, and fulfilling end. The music (especially the whistling) fits the movie well, and the camerawork/scene setting is - of course - the biggest draw of an epic film. It doesn't disappoint here; every scene in the jungle, the camp, and the bridge is gorgeous. The only real flaw to this movie is in the pacing; the movie flops from plot point to plot point; first it's a question of 'will they build the bridge?"" then, 'will they destroy it?' First you're rooting for the american rebel character, then he disappears for an hour, then you're asked to root for him again; it's all a little jarring. Otherwise, great.",

Lean's end action sequences are undeniably the best of their time and they still look just as good now. The acting is great especially Guinness in his Oscar-winning role. Everything from the bridge itself to the location filming looks and feels great. A spectacle of storytelling with blockbuster special effects and lots of smart symbolism for the film goers looking for deeper meaning. People might not like the off the wall ending, but there is no denying the talent of David Lean, Alec Guiness, William Holden, and everyone else that helped work on this magnificent production design that still looks amazing to this day.",

Trouble is, Nicholson refuses to cooperate due to Saito's demand that his officers do manual labor (contrary to the Geneva Convention, of which Nicholson just happens to have a copy), and while he and his officers languish in confinement, the bridge construction goes poorly, and eventually Saito reluctantly gives into Nicholson's demands. Despite his victory, Nicholson orders his troops to build the best bridge possible - to the total bafflement of Major Clipton (James Donald), the surgeon who wonders whether Nicholson is being a good soldier or collaborating with the enemy. Meanwhile, American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden), a prison at Saito's camp, escapes and is rescued by British soldiers. Recuperating in Ceylon, he is recruited by Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) to join him and a wimpy Canadian commando (Geoffrey Horne) to go on a raid to destroy same bridge, forcing Shears to join them by threatening to reveal the truth about his rank. It all builds to a climax involving all of the above-mentioned characters, the bridge, a crap-load of plastic explosive, and a Japanese troop train.",

This film is (as everybody know) a master-piece, it's about the true feelings of soldiers. I think that the story is mainly based in visual effects like the jungle, the wonderful beaches and waterfalls but above all this story has a great script based in one of Pierre Boulle's master-pieces. In the movie we can see some great dilemmas such as Joyce's doubt about his ability to kill when needed; Saito's respect for Nicholson vs. wish to complete the bridge (and avoid hara-kiri); the final scene when Nicholson understands what I has done to his compatriots and then even death he completes their mission.

274,5 November 2013,blazesnakes9,10, David Lean's best work since Lawrence of Arabia,"I've made a list of the top 10 favorite movies that I would to watch over and over again. These 10 movies will forever be near my heart and always influenced me to be a movie director in the future. The Bridge on the River Kwai is definitely one of the top 10 favorite films on my list. Of course, I also enjoyed and love other great movies as well. Other movies included on the my list are: 2001: A Space Odyssey, Bullitt, The Terminator, Thief, Lethal Weapon, The Wild Bunch and Alien. The Bridge on the River Kwai is also included. The movie is set in Burma during World War II. The year is 1943, and British POW's are being held up in Japanese war camps. One of those British POW's is Colonel Nicholson, played by Alec Guinness, who won an Academy Award for his role in this movie. Nicholson and his fellow men are assigned to build a bridge that will be used for a railway that will go through the Burmese jungle. Meanwhile, another POW, an American, played by William Holden, plans to blow up the bridge and sets off into the jungle to escape from the camp. Eventually, Holden and his recruits are all rounded to destroyed what is being constructed. David Lean is a cinematic master. His work is eye-popping and very vivid to look at. However, he is not one of my favorite directors. But, what I like about this movie is the way he tells the story. Some people may called it a war movie. But, others, like myself, would say that this movie is both a war movie, but most importantly, a war movie about individuals. So many war movies reflect on the pain of war. A lot of them reflect on the horrors of war itself. The Bridge on the River Kwai is a war movie about people. The people in this movie are devoted to be put into a plot that involves having to struggle and survive this snaring scenario. As we watch Bridge on the River Kwai, we are reminded that the two leading characters are different men coming from different backgrounds. One is honorable, but arrogant among his men. The other is not honorable and damaging, perhaps. These two men are stuck in a story where the only thing that stands in their way is a bridge. As a matter of fact, the bridge also plays a significant role in the movie. The bridge is a mark of the Japanese colonel, who assigned Nicholson to build the bridge. The Bridge on the River Kwai won 7 Oscars, including Best Picture. I like it a lot. Much of it is based on the story, direction and characters. I like when movies break new ground with their original stories. It's films like this one that reminds us how much we love movies.

I believe I had first read through Planet of the Apes, also by author Pierre Boulle, and was surprised to find he had written this one as well. I was crestfallen, I suppose, when I watched the movie upon completing the book, because I wanted them to be more alike. It's a good movie, but it's different from the book, which is also good. Which leads me to a bizarre conclusion: I recommend the book, and I recommend the movie, but I don't think I recommend doing both around the same time. As strange as it sounds, this odd remark exemplifies to me one of the major themes of both, namely, absurdity.",
293,11 April 2023,Escapist-2802,10, A Masterpiece of War Cinema,"The pinnacle of epic war films, featuring breath-taking images of the jungle and the river, superb acting by a stellar cast, and an engrossing plot that keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats. The film explores the complex themes of duty, honour, pride, and insanity that arise from the clash of cultures and ideologies between the British POWs and their Japanese captors. The film focuses on the character of British colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), who becomes fixated on building the bridge as a badge of his professionalism and a testament to his men's skills, even at the cost of aiding the enemy's war effort. In contrast, the character of American Shears (William Holden) seeks to flee his fate as a soldier and escape from the hellish camp, only to be reluctantly recruited for a daring commando mission to destroy the bridge. The film also features a memorable and distinctive score by Malcolm Arnold, which incorporates a humorous and defiant rendition of the ""Colonel Bogey March"" whistled among the characters as a sign of their spirit and resilience.",

It is psychologically deeper and harder than every other war movie you will ever see, along with Apocalypse Now. David Lean, also director of Lawrence Of Arabia, just made an incredible job and really deserved that Oscar for the film.",
296,28 January 2011,vanhelsing19,10," Jolly good show, jolly jolly good show...","The film is set in 1943, in a POW camp in Burma, along the route of a rail line the Japanese were building between Malaysia and Rangoon. Seen through the eyes of Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), commanding officer of a battalion of British war prisoners, the war narrows to a single task, building a bridge across the Kwai. The film then focuses on exactly what the viewer considers to be mad.",
297,10 January 2005,popeman89,6, Unclear messages spoil an film that looks brilliant,"When watching this, I found that the messages and subtexts contradicted themselves. For example, when Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) refuses to lose his dignity because of his pride of the British army, he inadvertently helped the Japanese, so his patriotism got in the way of his patriotic duty. So is it wrong for a soldier to be patriotic? But right for them to do their patriotic duty? Another problem with this film the portrayal of the Japanese prisoner of war camp. At times it portrays the Japanese officers as brutal but at other times they are kind and fair to the prisoners. From the way it was portrayed in the film, the British soldiers probably had a better time working on the bridge than fighting in the war and risking their lives. Therefore I see no problem with them helping the Japanese even thought they are supposed to be the enemy.",

I found this film far more engaging than ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" perhaps because the people at the core of this gem were more ""human."" They took human idealism to all sorts of extremes. If you haven't seen this one...what in the world are you doing on the Imdb? Sign off and head to the video store---NOW!",
302,10 July 2005,Philsb86,9, An Alternative WWII Movie,"Not only does this movie provide great action, an interesting look into a somewhat civilized Japanese WWII P.O.W. camp, and a superb ending, but it does an excellent job of analyzing the psychology that was quite prevalent amongst the aristocracy, the rich, and higher ranking officers in Britain since King Edward III conquest of Wales and Scotland in the mid 14th century. While watching this intriguing movie, pay particular attention to Colonel Nicholson (Sir Alec Guinness, better known as Obi-Won Kenobi), and his reactions towards orders, rules, and regulations, and his unwillingness to deviate from them: a tragic flaw of sorts for the colonel. Expand Guinness' character a thousand-fold and you will understand what many interpret as British ""arrogance,"" and how it fell out of existence from the government after WWII (for the most part), and why the empire collapsed.",
303,13 February 2022,LawrenceofAsia,9," A masterpiece, though too long.",Great movie. But a bit too long and too slow by today's standard. The last 10 minutes of the movie is full of tension and is so impressive. The original novel didn't have the bridge blasted. But the screenwriter feels deeply that the bridge has to be blown up. So they argued whether Alec Guiness should do it intentionally or unintentionally. It is impossible for Alec Guiness character to change his mind at that moment. So they decide he did that unintentionally. It is a bit Hollywood stretch. But they can get away with it.,
304,2 June 2005,soxfan42,10, The finest study of war to be seen,"""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is not a war movie. It is a movie about war. As someone who dislikes the typically gory, generic war movies (e.g. Windtalkers, We Were Soldiers) that try to slip a belated message about the horror of war in between explosions, I find this movie to be an absolute masterpiece about how war can only destroy and how it shatters the world for all who fight in it. Alec Guinness (who, I admit, is my favorite actor) won an Oscar for portraying Col. Nicholson, a man who builds the bridge under various pretexts of creating better conditions for his men, a group of British P.O.W.s in Burma. However, his true need is for a feeling of creation amidst the destructive force of World War Two. William Holden is also masterful as Shears, an American concerned primarily with his own survival. The cast is rounded out with a gung-ho British commando, a Japanese colonel obsessed with his own possible death, a younger commando who must cope with his duties that call for the killing of other humans, and one poor medic who plays Cassandra to a world defeated by war. This movie is not about war. It is about humanity and how we may lose it in the currents of war.",
305,16 June 2006,helen-115,10, The absurdity of war,"I think I am speaking for most women when I say that war movies are not my favorite genre. However, this is not your typical war movie. It is a fascinating character study of the madness of the men who have chosen, and are devoted to military life. It shows the impact of their decisions on the lives of the men and women who get swept up into their dustbin of insanity. Sir David Lean, the director, grew up in a Quaker family, which I believe helps to explain his perspective in this film and others of his. ",
306,21 October 2011,polos_are_minty,8, Bridge on the River Kwai,I enjoyed the Bridge on the River Kwai a lot more than I initially remembered doing. Not having seen it for a considerable time a lot of the plot points and story where lost to me. In a lot of ways it is very similar to most other war films. A lot of the characters are certainly the same and are almost interchangeable.,
307,13 February 2002,full_meddle_jacket,10, Ranks In Top Ten War Films Ever,"I'm normally a very picky movie fan, especially when it comes to historical accuracies. And though ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" has two or three (not near as many as the flawed ""Gladiator""), those little tidbits are completely overshadowed by some of the best performances  I've ever seen--by anybody. Sir Alec Guinness especially inspires awe with a relentless performance, right down the core. In my opinion, this film ranks in the Top 10 War Movies ever (though the film takes place in a P.O.W. camp). A must for any war movie fan! --Bud Sturguess, Texas",
308,9 June 2006,cfcpg,5, Aspect ratio 2.55:1 The screen is too wide,Unlike David Lean's absolute masterpiece LAWRENCE OF ARABIA here no miracle has occurred. The quality of the images are far from being stunning. The music score is far from being memorable. The story doesn't quite capture me.,
309,30 March 2023,shinrisen,8, Is it always right to do your best at a task?,"The Bridge on the River Kwai is a very entertaining film with a lot of interesting characters. When the film explains its premise in the opening scenes, I was a little weary that it was going to be a film about the cruelty of the Japanese war camps and that it'd be really bleak, but I was quickly proved wrong. The film has its comedic moments and the general development of the plot makes for some very amusing situations. The way the Japanese colonel and his efforts at building the bridge are so outmatched by the 'honorless' British troops was brilliant.",

I can't really explain why I like this movie; every few years I re-watch it just to make sure my esteem is correct, and it always is. I don't even go for old movies usually, but The Bridge on the River Kwai just gets me, like a joke I can't stop laughing to.

Alec Guinness is amazing.  Jack Hawkins is as strong as ever.  William Holden is as good as he needs to be.  People have commented that Holden's character is what stops this film from being as good as it could be.  I'll argue that Commander Shears is necessary to help draw attention to the attitudes of Colonel Nicholson and Major Warden... he has to be there to provide an alternative to the single mindedness of the ""Gallant Brits.""  Sure, Holden probably didn't deserve top billing, but it probably helped to sell the film at the time and, in any case, Guinness won the Oscar he deserved so who cares about billing.",

325,29 January 2020,jamesomullane,10, Classic war movie,"The Bridge On The River Kwai is one of those films that doesn't have a savagely complex plot. For a war film, it's easy to watch and has quite an upbeat feel. Every single scene is entertaining, and even though it's very long, it doesn't seem so. Alec Guinness is excellent as the fearless leader, and there are some great characters among his men. Speaking of great characters, William Holden is perfect as the guy who just wants out. David Lean always allows for time to breathe in his scenes, which I find an advantage and with such incredible cinematography, you can really soak it up",

I am not implying that I have watched every war movie out there but of the one I have I can honestly say this movie is really unique. This movie is great for a number of reasons but what really makes this movie great in my opinion is that it does not glorify war like some movies (G.I Joe an obvious example) or show the tragedies of war (one example is Full Metal Jacket.) This movies shows war in a totally different light. War is not good or mad but a matter of principle. Both Colonel Nicholson and Colonel Saito are crazy and would rather dying than give in to the other. The struggle between these two for me show that war is not good or bad but a struggle and both you and your enemy are in the same struggle, the struggle to succeed, the struggle to survive. Not everything is black and white.",
