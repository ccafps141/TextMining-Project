0,16 August 2004,Quinoa1984,10," My third favorite Kurosawa film- deliberately paced (not painfully so), heavy on tragedy, and glorious in overall artistry","I would agree with Ebert's review on a point, that Akira Kurosawa, legendary director of such samurai classics as Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Hidden Fortress, and Kagemusha, as well as human dramas like Rashomon, The Lower Depths, and Red Beard, could really best direct this film in his old age. There's something about his version of the doomed King Lear of Shakespeare, his Lord Hidetora Ichimonji that could be truly captured by someone in old age. Not to say that directors can't make great films when they're young, or in middle age, about a man in the dark days of the golden years (About Schmidt, Tokyo Story, Bob Le Flambeur, and Kurosawa's own Ikiru come to mind). But it's clear that Kurosawa must've seen or felt or understood at least an element of Hidetora's character, something that goes beyond tragedy that is stuck with all who are mortal. ",/
1,19 August 2010,Loving_Silence,10, The Best Film based on one of Shakespeare Best Works. This Masterpiece is recommended for anyone that loves movies . Truly one of the Greatest Films of all time!,"Akira Kurosawa's 1985, Ran, is based one of Shakespeare's greatest works, King's Lear. The Film proudly stands along with his other classic such as Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Roshomon, Sanjuro and the Hidden Fortress. He is a master in the art of filmmaking, no one can film an epic battle scene quite like Kurosawa. This is recognized as the most expensive film ever made by Akira Kurosawa, it was at that time, Japan's most expensive film ever. Being at the age of 75, he still showed us, he's one of the best in the business.",r

3,3 November 2005,zolaaar,10, Jester and Warlord,"'Ran' is the Japanese word for chaos, riot, dissension. Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece is indeed a feast of destruction and perdition, charged with symbols and powerful in pictures like it is found very rarely in today's cinema.",v
4,3 July 2009,murtaza_mma,10, Greatest rendition of a Shakespearean Epic,"Ran is probably cinema's greatest rendition of a Shakespearean Epic, ironically coming from an oriental film-maker. Adapted by Kurosawa from Shakespeare's King Lear, Ran undoubtedly features amongst the best works of the master auteur. It captures with sheer vividness and surreal resplendence, the true essence of human struggle for survival, highlighting the cruelties associated with life. Ran is strictly indicative of the sole consistency of life i.e. Change, an attribute that not only makes the humans vulnerable but also gives them the hope to rise after a fall.",i

6,31 March 2004,Elendil87,10, The Greatest Shakespeare Film,"Throughout his career Kurosawa strove to achieve what he called ""real cinema"", proclaiming that ""in all [his] films, there's [only] three or four minutes"" of such quality. Many would argue that he was his greatest critic. For if not in ""Seven Samurai"", then definitely in ""Ikiru"" and if not in ""High and Low"", then definitely in ""Rashomon"" he must have achieved this plateau of greatness. Well, if not in any of his other films, then definitely in ""Ran"" Kurosawa finally came to the apex of cinematic artistry. With the both lyrical and grandiose tone of its craft, its beautifully spare imagery, its haunting score by Toru Takemitsu, and its lead Tatsuya Nakadai's masterful understated performance, ""Ran"" is perhaps the most fully realized epic ever made.",w
7,7 August 2001,Anonymous_Maxine,10," Sometimes, given sufficient objectives, even the people who are closer to you than anyone else can turn against you.","In another lengthy samurai epic, Akira Kurosawa approaches the boundaries between family members and the damaging affects of one of his rather common themes - reckless ambition. This is very clearly a Kurosawa film, a respectable trait that is most clear in the cinematography, in which Kurosawa uses many extensive shots with little to no camera movement, as well as the common natural setting, characterized by the far-reaching landscapes of sweeping hillsides.

8,5 August 2009,Samiam3,7, Strong but Sloooooooowwww,"I am not certain, but I think Ran was Akira Kurosawa's last big feature. Visually, It might be his most distinctive. Being in color opens a lot of doors to cinematography, and makes it easier to see how much artistic creativity went into the sets and costumes. There is something else distinctive about Ran. It is his slowest picture. You need extreme patience to make it through this very long movie, and you also need to understand the context of the story.",r
9,30 December 2004,O_L_D_B_O_Y,10, RAN - A Classic Of Its Time And For All Time,"Based on Shakespeare's King Lear, this film follows the story of the aging warlord Hidetora who, in an attempt to restore peace, divides his kingdom between his three sons - Taro, Jiro, and Saburo - and retires from his duties. However, one of his sons sees this as unwise and is banished by his father, leaving his two brothers in charge of two of the three castles left in their hands. It isn't long before they are overtaken by greed and eventually betray their father, leaving him in the hands of a philosophical jester and a loyal retainer. This betrayal ultimately leads to war, dividing the family and driving Hidetora insane.",w
10,3 June 2005,FilmOtaku,5, Not as great as I thought it would be,"Realizing that it is practically heresy in the film world to criticize a Kurosawa film, much less downright dislike it, I'd like to precede my review by saying that I have absolutely loved every Kurosawa film I've seen  until now. ""Ran"", Kurosawa's 1985 film based somewhat on Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" is the story of an elderly emperor who hands down his kingdom to the oldest of his three sons. While the oldest and middle son fan over each other, saying that they are not deserving, etc. it is the youngest who speaks his mind about the subject, incurring the wrath of his father and ultimately, banishment from the area. Meanwhile, the two older sons are making a mess of things with the kingdom, leading to wars, fratricide and the dismissal of their father, even attempting his murder. None of their motives are noble or honorable, only avarice and power motivate them, leading to tragedy for all.",4
11,10 June 2012,TheLittleSongbird,10, Akira Kurasawa's take on King Lear,"I loved Kurasawa's Throne of Blood, and heard this was even better. And indeed it was, for me second only to Seven Samurai as his best film and one of the finest movies ever made. As with any Kurasawa film, it is superbly made with the camera work in look and technique masterly and the colour and period detail really sumptuous. The battle sequences are even more epic in scope and emotional impact than Seven Samurai, aided by the spectacle and camera work. The music is rousing and haunting, almost sometimes paying homage to Mahler, the script is literate and thoughtful and the story intensely moving. Add to that Kurasawa's ever immaculate direction and the truly remarkable lead performance Tatsuya Nakadai and you have an even more brilliant film. Rounding off is the truly Machiavellian performance of Mieko Harada as the daughter-in-law figure. The over-two-and-a-half-hour length and slow pacing didn't hinder Ran in the slightest, at least to me anyway, though some not used to Kurasawa's style may be deterred. In conclusion, there wasn't much I really could add to the wonderful reviews already, but I do think Ran is a superb film with much to admire. 10/10 Bethany Cox",4
12,17 July 2012,kluseba,4, Failure at the highest level,This movie came as a big disappointment to me. I really adore Japanese culture and history and I am a big fan of Asian cinema. I was looking forward to see a film that is considered as a masterpiece by many and has risen to world wide fame.,7
13,24 October 2016,Leofwine_draca,9, Kurosawa's late historical masterpiece is one of the best Shakespeare adaptations out there,"This was my fourth Kurosawa film and my favourite to date. Previously, I'd started off by watching SEVEN SAMURAI (a great film), then trying out KAGEMUSHA (which I thought was okay, but too constrained by budget). Next up was an early classic, RASHOMON, which was a fine human drama, and now comes RAN, Kurosawa's final historical epic and the film that he claimed KAGEMUSHA was a mere warm-up for. I can see that. RAN is an epic film, truly epic and one of the best-shot films I've ever seen. Every frame of the film seems to have been painstakingly composed and the result is a bright, colourful, and vivid production that fully brings to life the castles, costumes, and characters of feudal Japan.",9

15,16 September 2009,Hitchcoc,10, A Masterpiece of War and Greed,"This is film that everyone needs to see. It brings home the horrors of war, betrayal, and greed. When the kingdom is divided among the sons in this version of King Lear, we just know that the person who bares himself honestly is going to become an outsider. The acting is sensational, with masterful personal encounters. Kurosawa even managed to keep the fool as an integral part of the story. Others have eloquently dissected this movie. What I have to offer is that there is such a poetry to the visual aspects of this film. While the battle scenes are among the goriest and grizzliest that have ever been put on celluloid, there is a dance here, a wave of the most intense coming and going as we watch the soldiers fall. It tells how potentially good men can be influenced by the forces of evil. The wife of the first son is purely vengeful, and horrifying. She is nearly a carbon copy of the woman who played the wife of Mifune's Macbeth character in ""Throne of Blood."" I have been reviewing the Kurosawa canon and am convinced that this may be his finest work.",7

17,6 February 2007,sherbetsaucers,10, Awe Inspiring,"At the core of this movie there is a long running philosophical question. Certain characters continually question what is happening around them, and through these questions, the themes of the movie are forthcoming. The most obvious theme is that of war. Here, once again, Kurosawa reminds us that modern warfare is not a place of honour or duels, but massed attacks on faceless enemies, shooting each other from a distance. I will discuss the battle scenes later in this review; they help us examine the chaos that is again consistent throughout the film. It seems that no one in this movie has any control over the events that are transpiring; not even the ultimate manipulator Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede has true control. This lack of control seems to mirror the idea put forward by the only character who is continually able to tell the truth without ramification. Shinnosuke Ikehata (credited here as Peter) is the fool who says 'Are there no gods... no Buddha? If you exist, hear me. You are mischievous and cruel! Are you so bored up there you must crush us like ants? Is it such fun to see men weep?' Even if god exists then the only pleasure he enjoys is watching mankind destroy itself in the chaotic mess that is war. The final scenes see chaos erupt, as through the good natured actions of one man, 4 armies are dragged into a bloody battle. Which leads us to the idea of futility and death. The pointlessness of life is summed up once again by the fool. 'Man is born crying. When he has cried enough, he dies.' Death comes to us all, yet it is far bleaker than that. If there is a god then they allow everyone to suffer. Even a noble character, like Saburo, dies an ignoble and futile death. Everyone within this movie is both hunter and hunted. It is a bleak world indeed.",/

20,3 March 2019,Horst_In_Translation,6, Daunting descent into despair and desolation,"""Ran"", which means translated ""Revolt"", bit this is not really used as a title for this film, is a Japaese/French co-production from 1985, so it will have its 35th anniversary next year. This movie is linked inevitably with Akira Kurosawa, by many considered the finest non-American filmmaker of all time, and it is a late career effort by him. He had already been in filmmaking for way over 40 years when he came up with this one we got here thatg turned into one of his career-defining movies. It is of course in contrastg to most of his earlier stuff in color and runs for over 2 hours and 40 minutes. I guess it was a tribute to Kurosawa that the Academy really appreciated this one as it also could have been a film that could have gone completely under the radar. However, it scored 4 Oscar nominations, one of them being for Best Costume for which it took home the award. And I think all these nominations are not undeserving. On the contrary, one or two acting nominations, for Nakadai and Haradai perhaps, would have been appropriate too. Butg lets get into the film. This is the story of an influential old Lord (played by a much younger actor by the way) who hands on the power to his sons. Too late he recognizes thatg he made a huge mistake that may not only endanger his heritage, but also his life eventually. But while the sons are pursuing their violent path, there is a new threat rising with a women full of revenge. Can the last remaining son help his father find a way out of his misery? Watch for yourself. One thing I want to emphasize here is that I mentioned earlier Kurosawa made many b&w films, but the way he uses colors for this film proves without a doubt that it is a shame he did not make more color films. For example before and after this film, there is a break of five years each. Anyway, with colors I was referring to red, yellow and blue mostly here, the colors symbolizing the sons and their armies. Things get heated for the first time when the old patriarch kills one of his soldiers' sons who was about to kill one of the old man's guards. Blood is not thicker than water in this case and the blue son (lets call him that) predicted it correctly. It takes a long time for the father to understand and a really rocky journey during which he turns from one of the most influential men of his country into an old bum you could say that is considered insane by many.",e
21,11 July 2020,clanciai,10, King Lear turned into a monumental epic in Japanese,"There is nothing wrong with treating Shakespeare at large with any licence, which Akira Kurosawa's ultimate masterpiece is a clear evidence of. He sticks mainly to only the skeleton of the play and makes as many deviations as possible, the most remarkable and successful being to let the fool stay on with King Lear throughout the drama to the bitter end, while in the play he is lost half way without an explanation. Instead of troublesome daughters there are troublesome sons, and the youngest proves to be the only true and correct one of them, like Cordelia, and meets with a similar fate but more militarily. In comparison with his earlier masterpiece ""Kagemusha"" there are less horses here and less beautiful music, while the main character of the film with its many devastating battles and massacres is rather apocalyptic, with some marvellous contrasts to the general doom, especially by the female interaction and the blind flutist, who makes something of a frontispiece and symbolic figurehead to the entire epic, adding some profound symbolism. Above all, Tatsuya Nakadai as the troubled old king is the best and most convincing Lear type I have ever seen, transcending even Laurence Olivier's characterization by mere physical acting without speech - his finest part is when he sits totally unmoved while everything around him is burning in the apocalyptic siege of the castle after the first hour. His long white hair, his wild eyes, his impersonation of the ultimate despair by mere movements and expressions - is enough to make this film only for his sake one of the most outstanding and indispensable films in all history - and it was Akira Kurosawa's ultimate masterpiece, made when he himself was 75 years old.",f

23,20 January 2006,planktonrules,7, excellent but not among his very best,"I absolutely love the films of Akira Kurasawa and have seen most of them. And, for some reason, this is not among my favorites although it is one of his highest rated films on IMDb. Perhaps I'm just being too picky, but I think MAYBE its popularity is because it was made somewhat recently and some of his older (and I think more interesting) films are sometime forgotten. After all, MOST of the IMDb reviewers are old enough that they could have seen this film on the big screen, while very few could have seen his earlier films in all their glory. The other reason why I think it's a little overrated is that his version of Macbeth (Throne of Blood) is the best retelling of Shakespeare and so Ran, despite it being wonderful, pales if you see them one after another (like I did). And finally, the characters and their interactions are just sterile--with little understanding or life to the them.",=
24,7 April 2017,classicsoncall,8," ""The enemy is everywhere. Inside and out.""","I find myself in the same quandary with Akira Kurosawa's movies as I do with Hitchcock. I find some of them great and others just so-so, even if they're heralded by the professional critics. Having just watched Yimou Zhang's ""Curse of the Golden Flower"", I was pretty well conditioned for another film about Orientals in a dysfunctional family attempting to take each other out. The disconnect I have here is why all of a sudden the three brothers would have turned on each other without their father, Lord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai), having an inkling that they were so mercenary and self serving. I'm also put off by the histrionics and aping aspect of some of the principals. As an example, the facial contortions of Hidetora reminded me of John Belushi doing his eye squints as the Samurai character on 'Saturday Night Live'. Somehow it takes away from the seriousness of the character, as when Hidetora jumps off the cliff and winds up none the worse for wear in the valley below.",t

26,3 January 2006,jdoan-4,10, The most provocative ending.,"This film has to be seen. It is profound. It is stunning. It is a work of genius. I love the look of Kurosawa's black and white film. They have so much texture and tone. They have so much depth and character. I just recently watched ""Rashomon."" That is a very beautiful film. He is able to use color equally as effective. Every color is perfectly arranged. Like a painter, he composes each scene, each frame with tender affection. I doubt you can find a better looking film. The ending of the film is the most cynical, the most depressing, the most emotive of any film I have ever seen. It has stayed with me ever since I first saw it. Kurosawa, near the end of his career, has ostensibly lost all faith in human kind. There is no goodness. There is no decency. There is no hope. All that is left is meaningless suffering. That last few images are the perfect images of desolation. This is an excellent film.",_
27,11 May 2022,Tweetienator,8, Excellence,"Just paying my tribute to this fine piece: Ran is a great movie with powerful and superb visuals - the only weakness, if any, is the rather (maybe sometimes too) slow unfolding of the story told. Anyway, Ran is one of those works of Akira Kurosawa that are otherworldly good and absorb the right spirited audience into a different cosmos and a different time.",u
28,6 October 2020,Tanbalarai,1, This is terrible.,"After reading the script written by Kurosawa, the scriptwriter Hideo Oguni advised him as follows
He said, ""The audience is different today than when King Lear was written. In Shakespeare's time, the audience knew firsthand how important a powerful king was. They knew how tragic it was that he was dying and that his sons were fighting one another. In the audience minds, there was always the fear of invasion from another country. But that's not the case for today's moviegoers. The script has to explain that how the King was strong, how he was smart, how he was feared, how he was loved...
Shinobu Hashimoto, the screenwriter famous for ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Seppuku"", also expressed the same opinion in his autobiography.
But Kurosawa ignored their advice and made the film as he had written it. Even though the masterpiece he made in his prime was made thanks to their advice...
And then they made this terrible failure. In the original story, there is a character named Kent. That person tries to protect Lear. It shows how good King Lear was, how respected he was and how important a position he still holds today. In trying to protect King Lear, that means simultaneously trying to protect the nation. Whether it would work or not was very thrilling to the audience at the time.
Shakespeare used this kind of device in his works, but Kurosawa did not. In his script, Kent was reduced in size and the misery of the King was magnified. The reality of the drama as a large scale drama was lost and it became a mere drama about an old man becoming miserable.
If the king, who had been wielding the power, suddenly became an old geezer, the people around him would be more panicked. In the original story, the children were his daughters, so their rash behavior, ignorant of politics, was realistic. And there was prudence in the behavior of their husbands. In the 'Ran', the new kings are acting like morons as the daughters of King Lear. The new king and his entourage should have behaved more cautiously because they were afraid of the former king's influence. If the story was depicted in such a way, the potential of the third son when he teamed up with the former King would be implied and the audience would be able to enjoy the movie to the end even if the former King become more miserable for a while.
... The pictures are not beautiful at all and the acting is at the level of arts and crafts. This is a bad movie of a bad movie.",r

His first big hit was Rashomon in 1950, and then came Seven Samurai in 1956, which was then exploited by Hollywood in 1960 when it made The Magnificent Seven, an enormous hit at the time.

30,23 September 2021,briancham1994,7, Epic but drags on too long,"One of Kurosawa's later films shows his mastery of the samurai film. As he demonstrates across his career, the direction of epic battle scenes is definitely his strength. This time, instead of instilling a sense of heroism or justice, it feels like senseless bloodshed, with important characters killed off unceremoniously or stumbling around in a daze. The character drama that underlies this sad, showing the futility of conflict when driven only by personal ambition. The real standout here is the portrayal of Lady Kaede who really is a demon, instigating all the chaos around her for personal revenge. However, the film does drag on at times, involving too many characters. At least the jester was funny.",

32,18 April 2022,davidmvining,10, A monumental achievement,"The one movie that this reminds me most of isn't Kagemusha or Throne of Blood or any other film by Akira Kurosawa. No, the movie Ran most reminds me of is Fanny and Alexander by Ingmar Bergman. Both films feel like culminations of careers, two master filmmakers putting everything they'd learned about the craft of filmmaking into a single, epic film. Sure, Bergman's film didn't involve massive battles between armies, but it was epic in its own, smaller way, a saga. Kurosawa, perhaps playfully, called his previous film a dress rehearsal for Ran, and it's hard not to see Kagemusha in that light. The cast is largely the same. It uses similar sets, costumes, and story, but that feels dismissive of Kagemusha, which is a tremendous exercise in its own right. That being said, though, Ran is on another level. Comfortable again in control of the production (despite his near blindness), Kurosawa put together one of his most visually beautiful and emotionally fulfilling films, told on an epic scale, and adapting a complex work like Shakespeare's King Lear with skill and deftness.",

For this he got acclaimed mostly throughout his early career, when he made movies like ""Kakushi-toride no san-akunin"", ""Shichinin no samurai"", ""Rashômon"" and ""Yojimbo"". Many people however seem to forget that Kurosawa never stopped making great movies.

Visually beautiful, pure poetry in every frame and every death. There is strong symbolism on the red color and the fire.

45,11 March 2015,tomgillespie2002,10, Quite simply one of the finest films ever made,"Ten years in the making, Akira Kurosawa's Ran took it's toll on director Akira Kurosawa. Following a highly successful career in the 1950's and 60's, Kurosawa fell out of favour with modern audiences and producers due to his traditional film-making styles and topics. Japan had experienced it's own New Wave, where directors used innovative techniques to look forward, rather than looking back. Eventually backed by Sidney Lumet, Kurosawa developed his labour of love, based on Shakespeare's King Lear, and made Kagemusha (1980) - a 'warm-up' for Ran - while developing the project.

80,15 February 2006,jaesboxer,10," The Greatest Shakespearian Adaptation of All Time, and the Crown Jewel of Akira Kurosawa's Career","Of all Shakespeare's plays, none excels King Lear. Whilst Hamlet is the true masterpiece of language and poetry, Lear has a true human story unlike anything else in the Bard's writings. And here is the only film adaptation to do this great work justice, a Japanese film by master director Akira Kurosawa. This is the pinnacle of Kurosawa's career. It is a work that directly captures the tragedy of Shakespeare, and is final proof that Kurosawa was unequaled when it came to blending Eastern and Western styles. The story of Lear is transmuted into the story of Lord Ichimonji, who foolishly draws his flattering sons near him, whilst banishing the only one to speak the truth. What ensues is the chaos (Ran) of war, as a clan that Ichimonji built out of blood and death erupts in a power struggle. Ichimonji is the perfect version of Lear, considered by most Shakespearian actors as the hardest and most noteworthy role to play. Here are preserved all the classic elements: the loyalty of the third son (Saburo/Cordelia) in the face of insurmountable treachery, the crazy old man (Ichimonji/Lear) and the wise fool that follows him. Other elements are added, such as the Lady Macbeth like Lady Kaede, whose hatred fuels the ravages of war, the gentle Lady Sue and her blind brother Tsurumaru, both victims of Ichimonji's former wrath. In this film, Kurosawa gives birth to the brilliant vision that is worthy of King Lear. Its imagery is unmatched, and certain scenes, such as the Siege of the First Castle, are remarkable for their savagery, poetry, and tragedy. The final Battle of the Four Armies is unsurpassed in film. For people familiar with the techniques of Sun-tzu, this offers a fascinating glimpse of his strategy in action, with much more depth and planning than the bloodfests in Braveheart or Gladiator. And though the Seven Samurai is still his greatest work, Ran stands as Kurosawa's most complete masterpiece, an epic, a tragedy, and a truly masterful film that shows the vicious circle of destruction that arises out of war and ambition.",

Costumes/makeup = ten (10) stars; restoration = ten (10) stars; score = nine (9) stars; set/decoration = nine (9) stars; sound = five (5) stars. Today's mega-budgeted, tent-pole films consist of spectacular, computer-generated technical set pieces strung together like beads on an extremely thin (or near nonexistent) plot string. Director Akira Kurosawa has employed a similar approach here. There are two major technical beads on his string (and a fair number of minor ones). One of the majors is presented in the opening scenes where costumes (and actors' makeup) are overwhelming spectacular and, perhaps, the most gorgeous ever filmed for a samurai-like movie. The other major technical set piece occurs in the closing scenes of intricate military maneuvers by huge (some real, some not) armies. The plot string is excessively stretched/padded-out as well as twisted up and knotted to the point of numbing confusion. (I am not a fan of voice overs, but this is one film that could really use one!) Acting is hammy and sometimes ludicrous (a Kurosawa trademark) with characters using dialog styles that are often challenging to comprehend even with the subtitles turned on (another Kurosawa trademark). Some sound dubbing is poorly executed with outdoor scenes sounding like they were recorded in an echo chamber. Sets (indoor and out) are/appear completely authentic (filming occurred around and inside the most spectacular extant castles in Japan (except for the royal family's). Stunt work is curious with each stunt fall from a horse looking pretty much identical (same stunt person each time or reuse of the same filmed sequence?). Viewers who are riders will find mounting a horse on the right especially interesting. Camera format could have greatly benefited from a much wider aspect ratio to engender a more epic feel. Film score is rich and integrates well with scenes. Restoration is outstanding.

Basically the story is a reworking of the William Shakespeare tragedy King Lear, and it begins with the Great Lord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai) stepping aside as leader of his people and giving control of the empire to his three sons Taro Takatora (Akira Terao), Jiro Masatora (Jinpachi Nezu) and Saburo Naotora (Daisuke Ryû). The three songs are all have youth on their side to rule the kingdom, the eldest Taro is given the prestigious First Castle, while Jiro and Saburo settle for Second and Third Castles, and the Lord only wishes to be an honoured guest in these three castles for the continuing years of his life. The two older sons make their father happy, but the youngest may want to cause arguments by warning his father that the uniting of the three brothers to have control will not remain united after some time. Enraged by this the father banishes the young son for pointing out this potential danger, however the warning does come to pass when the oldest son plots with his remaining brother to take everything from their father. With all this going on a war is declared and battles are fought, the formerly powerful Lord Ichimonji is stripped of his former glory to the point where he may die, murders are committed within the closest family and friends, and in the end is only a bad ending for the particular characters. Also starring Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede, Hisashi Igawa as Shuri Kurogane, Masayuki Yui as Tango Hirayama and Yoshiko Miyazaki as Lady Sue. The story was just about easy to understand, I admit the first half an hour or so was the most interesting, but the rest had some interesting moments, the costumes were absolutely deserving of an award, and the battle sequences are great to watch, although I drifted in tiny moments I know overall it is a great epic drama. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Cinematography, it won the BAFTAs for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Make Up Artist, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film.

This movie is a pure joy to watch  as good as are other attributes of the movie, the cinematographic excellence leaves any other movie ever made so far behind. I have liked ""The Last Samurai"" for its imagery and amazing color presentation, but even that movie pales if compared to ""Ran"". Opening scene is spellbinding - music score along with those moments of deafening silence is way too good. No doubt, it was the most expensive Japanese film ever made. Lord Hidetora is superiorly awesome (especially when he turns mad) and Lady Kaede at times seems to be even more ruthless than Nurse Ratched (was in ""One flew over cuckoo's nest""). Also, so many subtle and some not so-subtle references to Buddha are timely and apt. However, I would confess that movie is not perfect - the attack on the third castle is more or less ordinary, and I do wonder how even in that wilderness, Kyoami was able to maintain squeaky clean clothes for himself and his master.

99,6 August 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7, A Shakespearean nightmare.,"Though much is often made of its lavish battle scenes, at its heart 'Ran (1985)' is a family drama. In typical Shakespearean fashion (the film is loosely based on 'King Lear'), it just so happens that each core member of that family has an army at their disposal. Even so, the feature is surprisingly light on fights; political manoeuvring, personal backstabbing and threats of full-blown war are far more prevalent. Thankfully, this talking is, essentially, as riveting as any skirmish could hope to be. Of course, familial conflicts often devolve into - and are keenly presented as - physical ones. The stand-out of these is a nightmarish, blood-soaked and oddly ethereal sequence depicting what's essentially a massacre. Its almost madness-inducing mayhem is truly horrifying to behold, with numerous extremely violent vignettes aptly conveying the futility and immorality of the entire situation. This alarming scene kicks off an introspective odyssey for the protagonist, one that sees him almost comatose and forced to come to terms with the many sins he's committed. He isn't a good man - that much is evident even from just the small number of his skin-crawling crimes we actually hear about - but we're able to truly empathise with him, even when he's being pig-headed or brutish. That's because we understand how deeply the betrayals he experiences must cut; anyone would be shocked if their sons treated them the way (at least a couple of) his sons treat him. Make no mistake: this is a tragedy. The plot unfolds slowly, painfully but inevitably veering towards an increasingly bleak conclusion. Its haunting end evokes a sense that perhaps it was all some sort of punishment. However, such bloodshed affects all those near it, not just those that may deserve it. In this way, it never feels fair, it just feels real. It's compelling, strangely affecting and fantastically well-conceived. 7/10",

101,23 July 2002,DoobieKeebler,2, Not good,"Having recently seen Seven Samurai and enjoying it very much, I thought I'd give ""Ran"" a chance. After all, it was 70th on the All-Time IMDb list and most of the times, I have not been disappointed by films with high ratings on IMDb. This is one of the exceptions...what a stinker of a movie. The DVD quality was horrible, so that might have contributed to my dislike, but I really didn't like this film at all. It was very touhg to get through...I had to watch it in pieces, because I could not take it in doses longer than 30 minute stretches. The acting is horrible throughout, the plot is like a bad soap opera set in Samurai-land, and the visuals, while artistic and nice to look at, are heavy-handed, distracting, and slow down this already tedious film. Had this been an American production, people would bash it beyond all repair...compare it to other 1985 films for example ""Back to the Future"", and it pales miserably. The dialogue, the comedy, the action...all amateurish. I know it's Kurosawa and he can do great things, but this one was no good and seems like an aging director trying to do something grand and wonderful, and like Francis Ford Coppola's ""Godfather III"", this one fails and is not even worthy of being compared to something like ""Seven Samurai."" How is this then in the IMDb Top 250 list? Well, it's Kurosawa, and it's different and it's ""artsy."" But is it good? Nope.",

108,25 November 2020,jamesrupert2014,9, Outstanding film from the end of a legendary director's career,"In this jidaigeki version of 'King Lear', an aging Warlord steps down after dividing control of his fiefdom between his three sons, only to discover loyalty and honour are a distant second to ambition and power. The film is the last, and one of the best, of the 'historical' dramas from director Akira Kurosawa. The production is outstanding, with beautiful expansive cinematography, excellent set design, and fabulous costumes (the film's only Academy Award win). The cast is great although Lord Hidetora Ichimonji begins to look a bit theatrical as he slides towards madness and Tatsuya Nakadai overplays the character at times. Mieko Harada is particularly good as Lady Kaede, who oozes Machiavellian menace as she ruthlessly manipulates Hidetora's hapless middle son Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu). The film moves at a faster pace than Kagemusha (1980), Kurosawa's previous jidaigeki and the battle scenes are epic and spectacular, with armies wearing brightly coloured armour and flying brightly coloured banners clashing like a game of 'Risk' brought to life. The stunt work is also excellent, especially the horsemanship in the ill-fated cavalry charges. All in all, one of the best films from the legendary Japanese director and a fitting 'swan song' to his output of historical dramas.",
109,26 November 1999,BB-15,10, Classic Story of Betrayal,"Ran (or Chaos) is a brilliant film. For some, there are a few obstacles to its enjoyment. It takes place at the time of the Samurai and it's subtitled since it is in Japanese. If that is ok, (it was fine with me) then you can look forward to a powerful tale of intrigue and betrayal. Speaking of the story, while it is based on Shakespeare (King Lear), it contains lots of action. And unlike some movies based on his work, Ran is very easy to follow. ",
110,2 March 2018,TheMovieDiorama,9, Ran is Akira Kurosawa's last epic.,"The man was a genius when it came to directing these long Japanese war epics and Ran is no different. This is Kurosawa's interpretation of Shakespeare's King Lear, a play that unfortunately I did not study. The plot consists of Lord Hidetora abdicating his empire and splitting the kingdom between his three sons, who each want to have total control. And so many castles are raided and many horseback battles are conceived. Whatever the scene, everything was filmed to perfection. I just adore Kurosawa's style, he doesn't rush a single scene. Leave a castle burning for 30 seconds, watch a man run through a field for 30 seconds or even look at the sky for 30 seconds. In theory, I should be bored...but his artistic integrity and majestic style is a sight to behold. What resonated with me the most was the screenplay, also by Kurosawa. Several lines of dialogue felt like Shakespeare and it's admirable to see an influential film maker be...well...influenced by another famous writer. Scenes where Hidetora descends into madness are great examples of this. Tatsuya Nakadai, who portrayed Hidetora, was once again outstanding. This equals his role from Kagemusha, it was an emotive and poignant portrayal of a father who has been betrayed by his children. The battle scenes were masterful work, hundreds of extras in clan attire definitely filled up the screen with contrasting colours. The costume and production design were yet again wonderful to look at. I do love me the traditional Japanese environment that Kurosawa captures with ease. Lady Kaeda though, was the manifestation of evil...her manipulative skills were fascinating to watch. This leads me to my only problem, which is that none of the major characters are likeable, even Hidetora had issues. So I struggled to become emotionally invested in these characters. However, the purpose of this iteration was to explore themes of betrayal and insanity, Kurosawa conveyed them to technical perfection. Not a complete masterpiece, but extremely close to being one.",

The characters are rich, major and minor as well defined and have a role to play with their character dynamic. Tatsuya Nakadai as Hidetora is a character who goes through the ringer as he descends into madness, face all his sins when he rose to power and goes into a mental and physical void as he ends up in a wasteland. The battle of Third Castle was a terrific sequence as a small force are in a last stand against massive army attacks, using arrows and muskets.

120,20 February 2023,Neptune165,9, Utterly breathtaking scenery and cinematography,"Akira Kurosawa's Ran (translit. Mandarin: ""luan"", lit. Chaos) is one of his most highly regarded films. It adapts the plot and narrative structure of Shakespeare's King Lear to the Sengoku Jidai: in place of Lear and his daughters Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia, we have the daimyo Ichimonji Hidetora and his three sons, Taro, Jiro, and Saburo. This transposition somewhat intensifies certain aspects of King Lear's moral conceit. Hidetora's sons neglect their formal duties under filial piety, just as he abdicates his own responsibilities as lord and father. While the actions of their Shakespearean counterparts is intuitively reprehensible, in Ran, they violate codified central tenets of Confucian ethics. Nihilistic interpretations of King Lear came into vogue in the 20th century, but while neither the stage production nor its film adaptation affirms a strong moral conclusion, to me it is at least clear that an ambiguous morality is not equivalent to a lack thereof. Ran is a cautionary tale about seeking privilege without responsibility, substanceless claims to moral superiority, and the banal yet fragile nature of what is truly good. Kurosawa's direction relies more heavily upon nonverbal techniques than Shakespeare's dialogue, and it is largely for his mastery of visual storytelling that the film is so highly regarded by critics. The film feels more of an exercise in visual storytelling, than necessarily a source of mass entertainment. It certainly is instructive in expressive cinematographic technique, with much to be learned and emulated. For the critical viewer, this is indeed a great masterpiece.",

123,29 December 2010,mjneu59,9, unforgettable samurai Shakespeare,"Sitting through three hours of Shakespeare transposed to a feudal Japanese setting might be enough to test the endurance of many viewers, but Akira Kurosawa's colorful reading of 'King Lear' offers a bold (and, at times, barbaric) spectacle well worth the effort, and not soon forgotten. The music of Shakespeare's language suffers in translation, but the scenario is faithful to its source, filling the screen with operatic intrigues, skullduggery, vendettas, and a Götterdämmerung climax that leaves just about every character dead. Like other Kurosawa films it takes a while to work up any momentum, requiring several long, static dialogue scenes to establish the conflicts between an aging warlord and his (thankfully color-coded) sons (plus one totally ruthless daughter-in-law). But once underway the story builds into an exciting, impressive, and exhausting melodrama far removed from its humble stage origins.",

The acting is good.... yet less impressive that other Kurasawa movies. I just couldn't love, hate or admire any of the characters. The camera tells the story in a beautiful way but sometimes it is just too far away to tell who is who.... one can only know by the color code if the banner!

130,23 August 2003,shusei,10, Dramaturgy of RAN,"First of all,I must say that this film will be the last and probably the best example of Japanese cinema, having tried to adapt Japanese traditional aesthetics, which is now dying. Kurosawa was very fond of theater NO, and in some films--""Throne of the blood"", ""Kagemusha"" and partly other jidaigeki films--he tried to use the elements of this traditional theater--slow movement of actors, sudden change of tempo,dialogue with Buddhist concept of life and death, mask-like make up of actors etc. But the most ambitious attempt of Kurosawa on this direction was in dramaturgy of ""Kagemusha"" and ""RAN"". They are twins in this sense. ""Kagemusha""'s story--the real person and his double, who is trying to be ""real"" and in the end dies as a result of the contact of two world--this world and the world of the dead--is very similar to one genre of theater NO--Fukushiki-Mugen-NO. ""RAN"" followed the same genre but the plot is based on one of Shakespeare's tragedy. The dramaturgy of theater NO and Shakespeare's plot were miraculously mixed and made into a quite original scenario, which in fact two-layered everywhere. So in this film there are so many terms from Buddhism and Shintoism, such a slow tempo and a sudden nightmare of the hero, which brings him to the unreal world of madness.Dream invades the real world and changes it into total chaos--""RAN"" means ""rebel"" and ""chaos"" at the same time. This deep structure may not be noticed by contemporary Japanese youth, probably will be forgotten by most of us, but it is really the artistic point which the director wanted to reach for about 40years,after he had seen theater NO at the first time---total simulation of this theater into his own cinema.",

And unlike Criterion, Wellspring uses gold subtitles, which are easier to read than the white subtitles Criterion uses. The DVD I saw has production notes, the film in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, a restoration demonstration, and two film trailers. The chief difference lies in the commentaries. The Criterion version has only one commentary by film historian Stephen Prince, and has a documentary on Kurosawa called AK, by French filmmaker Chris Marker, as well as Toho Studios It Is Wonderful To Create series of documentaries on Kurosawa. By contrast, Wellspring has no featurettes, but a second film commentary, by film producer Peter Grilli. Grilli's commentary is flat and uninvolving, filled with sweeping generalities about film, in general, and this one specifically,; as well delivering few specifics on Ran, much less individual scenes and moments- either within the diegetic reality, or in the making of the film. It is also punctuated by several minutes long periods of silences. It begs the question of why was this person hired to do the commentary? The second commentary is also by Stephen Prince, and it is reportedly similar, but not exactly the same, as the later commentary he did for Criterion. Prince is a very hit and miss commentarian.

When the patriarch of the Ichimonji family, Lord Hidetora Ichimonji, decides he wants to live out his remaining years in peace and ease, he hands over power of the kingdom to his three sons. In the vibrant opening sequence of the movie, Lord Hidetora announces this to his sons are receives mixed reactions from them. Two of the sons flatter their father and accept his request happily. The youngest of the three sons has an entirely different reaction, telling his father of the mistake he is making and how the kingdom will crumble if the powers are to be divided like this. Furious at his sons accusations, Hidetora banishes his youngest son, leaving the two older sons to rule the kingdom.

151,4 December 2014,Rickting,10, Close to perfect,"Akira Kurosawa is one of my favourite directors and William Shakespeare is my favourite writer of all time. As can be expected, combining the two creates cinematic gold. This adaptation of King Lear relocates the play to Japan a few centuries later than the play is set. A powerful war lord abdicates to his 3 sons and 2 of them turn against him and betray him. Shakespeare films rarely capture his genius, but this one does and then some. It adds depth and complexity to an already fine play, and makes the central character arguably even more compelling than he was in Shakespeare's version. It makes some changes here and there, but it doesn't feel overly different from its source material. This isn't just an adaptation of the play; it's using the play to create a sobering, fantastically powerful and completely mesmerising meditation of loyalty, chaos and war. This is absolutely incredible cinema which shows why it is one of the most successful art forms in the world. This dazzling, earth shaking masterpiece outshines not only every single other Shakespeare adaptation but all the paintings in the Lourve combined.",

Don't get me wrong, this isn't Kurosawa's greatest film( that still goes to Derzu Uzala ), but its an amazing epic that I'd watch with gusto over skipping past all the Gladiator's or Bravehearts you threw at me. Kurosawa directed an epic thats not only stunning but viscerally entertaining and elegantly sad. Scenes like the attack on Hideotora, the opening credits with its shots of warriors sitting quietly atop horses, or the final scene involving Lady Kaede achieve an almost operatic grandeur that shows the work of one of cinemas true craftsmen.

154,15 December 2007,golfer06,9, A Work of Art,"""Ran"" directed by Akira Kurosawa is truly a masterpiece in film. The essence of camera movement and capturing nature makes it one of a kind. Adapted from William Shakespeare, King Lear, the story centers around three sons, whose father decides to hand down his power and kingdom to one of his sons. After this moment, the sons are truly separated from each other by their need for hubris. Kurosawa does a excellent job with the long shot and capturing the beauty of the scene and the moment. Nature, is also another character in the film, that Kurosawa captures beautifully. At times of chaos it seems that nature responds to reveal a religious entity. By having instances of meaningful emptiness, it allows the audience to have a moments of reflection, which many other films do not offer. Also the pristine use of color in the movie really makes it a wonderful piece of art. Each brother in the movie contains their own color and when these colors clash, it reveals the essence of art. For instance, when the red and yellow sides clash, they cause an orange fire that is set in the castle, to reveal what happens when two sides merge. It may cause destruction and utter chaos. Also the music in the film really makes the film more captivating and worth watching. I highly recommend this film for its use of color, nature, and incredible camera movement.",

160,31 December 2020,sabxfad,10, Kurosawa at His Best.,"In my moviegoing experience, there have been only few films where I was awed at every frame. Ran is one of those films. 'Every frame a painting' is thrown around a lot. But if I had to pick one film to describe the above expression, it would be Ran.
This is a film with perfect cinematography, acting, and characters. The battle sequences are jaw-dropping. The colours that are presented in the screen is vibrant. And I have never been more interested in a film's story.
The story is adapted from Shakespeare's 'King Lear'. This is the best Shakespearean story adapted to the screen.
The characters are complex and their motivations are deep. The story is also sad. I got easily lost in this world and when I saw certain character arcs, I was in near tears.
This movie is worth watching just for its costume and set design (which it won an Academy Award for). Kurosawa uses the vast plains to his advantage in the framing of the landscape. You can admire something in every shot.
Characters act in a very human way. You can easily put yourself in his/her's position and feel their decision justified. This film is underrated in the sense of a human story. This movie is an epic of gargantuan proportions.
It's amazing to think now that Kurosawa couldn't get funding for this movie. He spent 5 years storyboarding every frame and the end result was a masterpiece. Ran stands alongside Seven Samurai as Kurosawa's best. And Ran is easily one of my favourite films of all time.",

Two of them accept his offer, whereas one declines, insulting his powerful father and being banished from the kingdom. One could already guess the events that unfold after are not good. The first two sons both struggle with the responsibility of power, as the old king struggles with the lack of it.",
164,5 May 2020,zeekwunlau,8, Ran,"I think one of the more prominent aspects of this movie is the treatment of death and some major changes. Before death and some turning points, there was no preparatory work, but this thing happened naturally in a seemingly flat tile. . For example, the protagonist's sudden death, before this, there was not even any sign. Sometimes life and change are like this. Shaking people's hearts in peace is the power of real substitution. Although some deaths and accidents were sudden, they were calm. However, this does not mean that the film lacks a close-knit, but that his close-knit is more reflected in the changes in the relationship between the characters in some events. Death is also very dramatic, but his dramatic treatment of death is unconventional. Death should be a relatively important node in our previous drama concept, and it is also a more vigorous and tragic thing in our life concept, but when we return to life, death often occurs, not as we have agreed in the past. Roaring accompanied by tragic and accompanied by all predictable foreshadowing, death and even other things as usual, just a certain event, he may have a huge impact different from other things, but before and during and After it happened, it might not be like the fanfare we imagined. This conflict between the abnormal planning and treatment of the dramatic state and the previous mass perceptions has caused very large psychological and logical effects. Everyone saw the passing of a life in a tile, and suddenly, despite the calm, it contained a stronger force than the hustle and bustle, the sudden death of Xiuhu, the sudden death of the three sons, all these issues were handled in this way, It makes people feel impermanence in the absence of God. However, in order to avoid the tiredness caused by this sudden tiling process, Kurosawa adopted exaggerated colors and stage effects to deal with colors, and the form and content were highly rebelliously merged, becoming a classic of film and television.",
165,14 February 2015,GeorgeRoots,10, Akira Kurosawa's Masterpiece.,"Kurosawa's last epic and the most expensive Japanese film of its time, ""Ran"" is the result of a master of his craft firing on a cylinders. Whilst my favourite of his work still remains ""Ikiru"" (1952), there is no doubt ""Ran"" is his masterpiece. The colours and level of detail the director went for is jaw dropping, spending 10 years storyboarding the film as paintings, even mourning the death of his wife for one day before returning to shooting the next.

The obvious King Lear plot leaves little to guess how this will turn out and the much vaunted battle scenes were rather clumsy. Compared to Kurosawa's early work in Seven Samurai with the wonderful characters or the stunning photography in one of my favorite films, Kagemusha, this film is just dull. It misses completely on the tragedy side since the characters are never really developed and much of the film looks like it was shot in a bowl of a volcano with dirt and dust everywhere. The comic relief of Kyoami, the jester/fool, is just whiny and annoying. When the great lord finally reaches the end of his wits his deep comments on life just seem silly. He is too stilted too play the ""mad"" role properly and all the long shots and very heavy make up leave little opportunity for facial expression.

172,3 May 2020,krational66,8," Right and wrong, success and failure, turn around and empty.","Kurosawa likes to adapt Shakespeare's plays, and most of his films are also few main characters. Fierce conflicts, simple and fixed scenes, consistent with the uniform structure, have their own characteristics.
In this movie, the characters are still simple. Xiuhu and his three sons, Xiuhu passed the command to his eldest son. The three sons were bluntly ousted by him. His home country was in chaos and he was also displaced. Taro and Jiro killed each other. After picking up his father, Xiuhu recognized his mistakes, but unfortunately he was in an ambush, and Xiuhu also died in anger.
But in this simple story, Kurosawa was able to shoot ups and downs, and it was exciting. This is also a consistent feature of his movies. The plot is often not complicated, but the director can make people worry and curious about how to progress. Perhaps this is inseparable from the characters 'distinctive personalities, that is, the characters are all It's very brilliant, so the plot retreats to the second place at this time, the director's creation of the atmosphere, and the character's Huacai performance at the gate, attract more audiences.
Kurosawa said that this movie was filmed with the attitude of overlooking the beings in the sky, so there are almost no close-ups and few close-ups.
The protagonist of this film is undoubtedly Xiu Hu, who is a lifelike interpretation of Zhong Dai Da Ya. He is not only a sullen general, but also a loving old father. From arbitrariness to despair, the character changes during it are very convincing and crazy. After that, fluttering white hair, angry eyes, sad eyes, and the strong wind blowing the shirt from time to time, revealing his thighs that were too late to wear pants for escape, are all so sad-the impermanence of the world, From the top to the bottom, the disillusionment is undoubtedly unfolding.
The two women inside were also very striking. Both wives were destroyed by Xiuhu and their father and brother died, but they chose different paths. The wife of Taro, A Feng, retaliated, instigated Taro, then seduce Erlang, and finally the brothers murdered each other. She was also slaughtered, but she died without regret, rather willing to destroy the city, her determination and viciousness were shocking. In Kurosawa's ""Spider's Nest City"", there is also such a lady. Even if she is scheming or short-sighted, she finally sends her husband back, and it is also a vicious lady who is cruel and murderous. This lady had similarities with A Feng, the director at that time also meant to blame the character's failure on the shortsightedness and greed of the woman, but when she came to A Feng, she gave a more reasonable explanation, namely It's not that women are insidious by nature, but that there is a reason for it, and that there is excuse, A Feng is shaped into the role of the goddess of revenge.
The other Mrs. Mo, who was devoted to the Buddha, was very helpless about Xiuhu 's slaughter city in the past, and Xiuhu was very helpless about this. She said that if you are bad for me, I will be in a better mood, but Mrs. Mo is not at all with him Careful, recite the Buddha every day, and still remember to carry the portrait of Buddha on the way to escape. When was the grievance reported? With a gesture of evasion and forgiveness, Madam Mor gave another solution to the hatred.
In the end, the family of Xiuhu's family collapsed, only Mrs. Mo's brother Hemaru, the blind man was still alive. He was using the blind stick to explore the road on the ruins of his former home city, and almost fell into the abyss. Perhaps it is a kind of metaphor. All living beings are just like blind people. They cannot see the way forward. If they lose the heart of Buddha and compassion, the abyss is in front.
Probably only such a tragedy can be filmed in the mood of overlooking the whole life in the sky. Otherwise, how could you bear to reveal the truth to the public so naked, Lu Xun said that the people in the iron house are actually afraid of such a tragic, but someone must wake up the people in that room. The bitter fruit that Xiu Hu finally tasted was originally planted by him. Even if there is a son who is reliable, he finally cannot withstand the retribution of karma. Looking back on life, is it a success or a failure? Is it gain or lose? The crazy Xiuhu muttered to himself, who I am, when he finally realized that he was small, it was too late.

It's a tale about an Ichimonji clan who has a ruler Hidetora and his three sons. Within the first few minutes itself the entire story will become clear to you. Kurosawa's mastery is seen in how the story progresses involving many characters and each playing a specific part. Lord Hidetora is ageing and he decides to give control of his kingdom to his eldest son. What follows next is a powerful display of human nature mingled with treachery, war skill, decision making, loyalty and many more. Keeping the main story on the top all the time it allows the viewer to think about the question of good or bad. Lord Hidetora's past was filled with slaughter and suffering to people and it comes back to him making the viewer wonder whether to sympathize with him or not. The film takes inspiration from the Shakespeare's king Lear. The acting from Tatsuya Nakadai (Hidetora) was spellbinding. Majority of his work was done by his scary eyes which depicted his inability to do anything when he understood that the fall of his empire was imminent. His face with all that whiteness of exasperation speaks things which no one after watching the film can ever forget. There is active participation of the supporting casts including the women (who influenced the story greatly) who might be the king's associate but were free to speak. It is the most expensive film Kurosawa had made and speaks for itself. The beautiful landscapes, the costumes, the palaces, the army scenes all shout for their achievements individually. It felt like everyone in the family had a grunt over something and wanted to be a part of it. The brothers had no affection at all for each of them. It would be nice to have a prequel to this story to see how these characters developed in the past. ",

I do wonder if maybe Kurosawa in his later period was sensitive to Japanese criticisms that he was too 'western' in his technique, and wanted to give it more of a Japanese feel - or perhaps he was deliberately paying tribute to the theatrical origin of the story, rather than the usual film technique of attempting to 'open out' and naturalize adopted plays.",

Much like the Seven Samurai and Yojimbo, its a great mix of serious filmmaking and entertainment, which means you can just sit down on a couch for more than 2 hours, absorbing all the little details while munching on popcorns. I tell you, this is rare since most movies are either too cerebral (not a bad thing) or too bombastic (sometimes not a bad thing). The battle sequences are very, very nicely done, and the characters are so tragic. Seeing someone like Hidetora falling downhill into a crazed, senile old man has never been so much fun. All sorts of characters appear in a form of double crossers, weaklings, manipulators, fools, honourable warriors, tragic victims, heroes... they're all here. Its easy to get convoluted in its plot, dialogue and visual scenes and say ""oh Ran is about betrayal"" or ""Ran speaks on the horror of war."" Look closely, and you'll see that Kurosawa uses the whole film to point out that mankind are foolish and questions our ability to change, even though we are aware of it (Ikiru shares this subtle parallelism on theme). The very last scene with Tsurumaru alone on a cliff is unforgettable.",

King Hidetora Ichimonji is 70 years old now. Among all of his three sons-Taro, Jiro & Saburo, he chose his eldest son Taro as a successor of his throne & demanded his other two sons to support him. The youngest son Saburo is prankster but the wisest & he isn't happy with this decision & rejected the idea. So the king banished him from the kingdom. And rest lies royal conspiracy, treachery & human tragedy. The movie is maybe the first color film of Kurosawa & rich with detailing cinematography, epic in its scale. It is also technically sound & polished film by Kurosawa. Watch the violent enemy attack tragedy scene inside the castle- a hall of fame of Kurosawa touch. The movie reflects too didactic in its approach. But without doubt its one of darkest drama he had made reflecting his fascination with history of human insanity.

Religion gets thrown in, and it's an anti-war film all in one. You might not take it all in, you don't need to, you take what you want from it and no more.

It's kind of Japanese version of ""King Lear."" Even though it is based on ""King Lear"" story, this movie approaches me very Japanese style. What I mean is, it follows buddism and rewards in accordance with deeds in our life by showing chaotic battles and betrayal.By watching this movie, it reminds me 'What comes around, what goes around.' Once you betray someone, you would be betrayed. In this movie battle scenes are splendid. I think Kurosawa shooted very unique way that shows well by using wide camera angle that capture both armies. In this movie, Hidetora's make up is too much overdone and I guess it's because influence of Japanese traditional play called ""Kabuki"" Development of movie takes long time form scene to the other scene, so it can be a little bit bored to watch but it's interesting to see how it does reflect our life.",

The minimal low quality actions scenes, coupled with wasted scenes that forcibly emphasize one of the character's insanity, added to the poor acting and that horribly annoying jester character , makes RAN a complete piece of crap. Why this movie receives the blind praise it does is something I will never understand. How can a movie this bad be considered one of Kurosawa's best? The only reason I could understand someone liking this movie even a little bit would be if he/she were a die-hard Kurosawa fan.

Technically speaking, this was the last great Epic to be made. The scale is massive. Not just because of the huge battle scenes in the end, but mostly because of how massive the story was. There are more than a dozen prominent characters, and within the 2:40, every character is properly developed, and each is very distinct. Tatsuya Nakadai, who plays Hidetora, gives one of the most powerful acting performances I've ever seen. Every second he's on screen, even when he's passed out sleeping, he has your complete attention. But luckily because of the great character development that Kurosawa gave us, each character is equally important to the overall story.",

With beauty and delicacy, he paints the screen with a cold emptiness, as only a master director could.  Life is absurd and cruel in this epic, but among the deceitful people who betray and kill even their family, there exists some who care.  The movie is dark, and seems to be without hope, but it is not Kurosawa with a doomsday message.  There is no message, nor an attempt to disillusion.  It is a movie that makes the viewer think and reflect, and consider who we are and how we act, and why we live. Supporting the content is the visual orgasm of colors, composition, and motion.  There are few movies that attempt to stretch the limits of film and human creativity, but Ran breaks past those barriers.  Such are the creations of not men, but truly elevated artists.

Lady Kaede is certainly a great role and she throws herself into it completely.  As for the film itself, Kurosawa's epic story manages to survive the film's overly long running time and preoccupation with stage blood.

Ok, it's almost 40 years old, but so is Blade Runner, and the likes of The Godfather even older. Epic scale, beautifully done.

214,14 December 2007,sungmini89,7, use of colors in the plot,"One thing that really stayed with me after watching this film was the ""colorfulness"" of the movie. Just in general, everything was so colorful; seems as though, the director, Kurosawa, concentrated a lot while he was filming the movie. The expression of the blood was very interesting; it seemed very fake (compared to the movies nowadays), but it still had a great effect to the audience with the bright red color. He also used the color to almost distinguish the sons in the movies; yellow, red, and blue. While watching, I thought Kurosawa expressed himself in couple different characters; one would be Hidetora, who is so majestic in the beginning in the movie but eventually referred as an old senile fool who can't even take care of himself. It seems as though he represented his career throughout the years, and how he must have felt throughout the years. Especially, when he expressed how pathetic Heditora felt when he couldn't even kill himself; just as how he tried to commit suicide but he fails. This film was a representation, from my point of view, of his career, as well as his life before he produced the film.",

The outcome of that was the father loosing his whole following of men and soldiers. While the other brother and the king of that particular castle got killed. which only left two brothers, but by the end of the movie there was only one of the brothers left, who was going to die anyway.

The running time is really long: 2 hour 40 minutes, however, I am always mesmerized by the film and forget such long running time. Tatsuya Nakadai's strong presence as the protagonist, sharp eyes like a beast, and his act which follow to Kabuki draw my attention; moreover, the scenes of Japanese Samurais' wars are represented courageously and beautifully by the Kurosawa's grand directions. Furthermore, it is possible to say that Kurosawa represents his ideas about god and death. Especially, at the last scene, a Buddha picture falls off instead of Tsurumaru. I think that Kurosawa represents the same thing with what Tango says; Tsurumaru can ""choose"" his way, alive or death, after the scene, and the picture of Buddha does nothing to him and just fall down from the top of the wall. That is to say, it is possible to argue that Tsurumaru is the metaphor of people who could choose disturbance or peace, and the Buddha represents the useless gods that cannot save people as Tango says. By the way, as a Japanese speaker, I am disappointed at the English subtitle a little bit because it breaks the presence of the Kurosawa's script which expressed in Japanese sometimes. For example, ""Old age is difficult (Aware, oitari)"" Surely, the meaning of this line is correct and exactly; however, I think the English subtitle does not have the power of the words which represented in Japanese.",

228,4 October 2000,jminer,10, Kurosawa at his grandest,"Ran means chaos in Japanese.  Instead of taking the story of King Lear and focusing on the central character as that title does, Kurosawa has chosen to name his film after its setting: a world of chaos unleashed by the pride and ignorance of a former warlord. Discovering what it is to be human, while hurtling around in a universe without rules or borders, is a theme that Kurosawa loved.  You can find it most accessibly in Andrei Konchalovsky's film Runaway Train, based on a Kurosawa screenplay.  The strength that evil has, if we allow it; the futility of so many things in which people believe; the redeeming power of love: these meant as much to Shakespeare in King Lear as they do to Kurosawa in Ran. Yet there is great beauty here - most of it associated with the pomp and circumstance of battling armies, and most of it belied by the violence they do.  The background, the universe in which Lord Hidemoto scuttles like a proud, crippled, spider, is blank; brown and grey in colour, but bereft of landmark. Just as, after Shakespeare's Act I, Lear never sets foot in a building; just as Ahab and Ishmael, having left Nantucket, never set foot upon land; so Hidemoto is cast out into darkness. Music, costume, cast, battle action: so good it's hard to remember you're watching a foreign film. This is film-making at its grandest and most universal.  Thank the bold Frenchman, Serge Silberman, who financed it when nobody else would, for one of the great films by one of the great directors.",

The scenography is stunning, the long teleshots reveal the cruelty of war better than any documentary film, and the music nails you to your seat with its bitterness and sadness.

A ""train wreck"" film is not like Roger Ebert's Idiot Plot example, where the film would be over and all problems solved if everyone involved wasn't an idiot. The characters in RAN are not idiots.

A perfect adaptation of a Western tragedy by a a director from the other corner of the world, and centuries later, with the liet motiv of Kurosawa's production in it.That's to say the bad habits of the leading classes that destroy themselves by themselves. Like a curse. If is not the case of Washizu condemned by the fate, the same one he wanted to destroy with his Lady in ""Throne of Blood"", as well as Jiro and his Lady Kaede, a perfect portrait of Japanese femme fatale, in this movie; or the decadence of an industrial family in the ""Bad sleep well"", as the one of Ichimonji clan in this case, the idea doesn't change. The ones that try to be powerful and are too sure to reach success, as the brigands in the ""Seven Samurai"" or the Takeda clan officials in ""Kagemusha"" will fail and will end as villains or fools. On the other hand, the poors show to survive as in the case of the fool jester of Ran, that, even if he was considered mad, in a madden world without value, will result, after the cloud were drifted away, the real winner. Even without an armour and a castle. Or, still better, without a wicked Lady ready to lick his wounds not to relieve but to soak blood. As can be seen in a breathtaking scene of fight and subsequent passion between Kaede and Jiro.The real fool and poor ones. With ""Ran"", so, the battle of the villains started in ""Seven Samurai"" seems to be resolved. And the losers are them, the leaders. And the weapon is their arrogance.

Another great scene that was tragic but somewhat comical is when Lord Hidetora Ichimonjiis tries to kill himself during the castle attack scene and ever attempt goes unaccomplished. He sees a sword, picks it up, and to his surprise it doesn't have a blade. Another scene is when numerous arrows are being shot into the castle, and every single on of them misses Lord Hidetora Ichimonjiis.

Then there is the third son who got exiled and predicted everything beforehand. He is not mad and loves his father who he doesn't love before the exile. Suddenly the old man is not mad any more and can talk again... Saburo the youngest son gets killed. The father dies for minutes. Followed by a monologue and bad acting.

Never sure whether to like or hate anyone, want to feel sorry for Lord Hidetora but never quite can, but eventually do, because he's a human being. Both battle scenes are breathtaking, in completely different ways.  The first was so sorrowful and awful and the second just unfathomable, just not possible, there there in front of you,  and in the end, both are equally pointless, needless, horrible in their destruction, yet sorrowfully just. It's amazing that a film that runs for 160 minutes and is only happy for the first five can have the bottom fall out of it so heart-wrenchingly at the end.  That after so much time wandering through such an unhappy world can take what little hope, what little joy, may be left, and snatch it away so breathlessly and finally.   To be a part of this world so long and to be left so empty is just an astonishing thing to me. I recommend making it a two-night event, and having something dutiful to do with your hands while you watch, especially the second night.

The story follows war lord Hidetora who attempts to divide his land up between his three sons Saburo, Taro and Jiro while slowly slipping into insanity. However, Taro's wife attempts to destroy the family in order to take control, resulting in the peaceful countryside descending into bloody chaos. Ran then reveals it's party piece- a visually stunning yet haunting battles between two of the brothers, while Hidetora sinks even further into madness. Through a blend of tragedy, action and suspense, Kurosawa has created a masterpiece which is deservedly a classic epic. Ran will appeal to those fond of the works by Shakespeare or film fanatics in general. Suspense and action make this film an absolute must-see.",

Even though they were flying everywhere around him, and they were on fire. And then he tried to commit suicide but he could not find a sword that wasn't broken. And to have all of the men with dozens of arrows stuck in them was very gruesome. I thought this was awesome and really set the standard for future war directors. I also thought that the women in this women are portrayed with lots of power and almost superior to the men. I think that this was really amazing because you don't often see this happening in film. Especially in Japanese cinema. All in all this movie is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone who loves war movies.",
263,6 April 2016,theveneficus,10, Absolutely brilliant on every level!,"The German artist Caspar David Friedrich once said that ""The painter should paint not only what he has in front of him, but also what he sees inside himself."" That is exactly what Director Akira Kurosawa has done with Ran. The story of a 70 year old warlord in feudal Japan who hastily decided's to split his thrown into three and leave it to his sons. Kurosawa was 76 when he directed this film, and shares many similarities with the central character Hidetora. The eldest Taro receives the first castle and becomes leader of the Ichimonji clan. The other sons Jiro, and Saburo are given castle's two and three. As I'm sure you can imagine things start to rapidly go downhill as Taro and Jiro's motives are soon shown crystal clear. Their greed is ultimately what led to chaos sinking its blooded teeth into the land. And soon Saburo who is cast out by his father raises an army in the hopes of securing peace across Japan. One excellent thing I noticed in this film is the subtle foreshadowing implemented into many scenes. There's an early scene where Saburo (who I initially thought would be the bad egg) insults two of Hidetora's subjects. After he's embarrassed his family the brothers get up and leave, but not before Saburo cuts down some bushes and uses them as shade for his sleeping father. That tiny detail cements his love and respect for Hidetora. The central theme to this film is 'chaos'. The word Ran even means chaos. And there's lots of intelligent scenes which foreshadow the oncoming mayhem. Such as short cuts of clouds ever growing larger until they've become uncontrollable storms. I really cannot say enough good things about this film. But this review has stretched on, so I'll leave it with this. Ran, is without a doubt the best Shakespeare adaptation ever put to screen, and in my personal opinion the greatest Kurosawa film there is.",

I was only able to watch it on video and I'm longing to see it on the big screen to fully appreciate Akira Kurosawa's ultimate statement about war. It's not only the masterly directed battle-scenes (which are among the best of all time, that is for sure) that make this film one the best war-epics, along with ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""All quiet on the western front"". It is Kurosawa's whole treatment of this complex adaption of Shakespeare's ""King Lear"": He reflects on the reasons of war, how longtime allies become enemies, how the victims split up in those who forgive and those who revenge and about the innocent, who pay in a war the highest price of all. All these elements are carefully developed and Kurosawa takes a lot of time to unfold his story. And to all, who think this movie needs to much time until something interesting happens: stay at least until the first battle. You'll see, everything that seemed boring or not interesting will work out perfectly and add up to one of the greatest movies of all time.",

This also helped the foreshadowing such as clouds and rain present at various parts of the film to imply the coming of a battle or a big event. Betrayal and the pursuit of power are the main recurring ideas. The battles between brothers for the place of the old father built into a non-ending killing of each other.

298,7 September 2019,27xllla,9, One of the best from kurosawa films,"""Ran"" is based on the greatest writer's William Shakespeare's play ""King Lear"". It is one of the best films about Japanesse history, it is a real masterpiece.",
299,7 August 2005,tenjou_tenge,9, Kurosawa Likes Shakespeare,"The most important thing about this film is that it is Kurosawa's take on Shakespeare's King Lear. That's the meat of it, and if you dig Shakespeare, watch this movie. One of the reasons those of us in the west almost invariably gravitate towards Kurosawa's films when popping our proverbial cherry in Japanese film is because the production value of ALL his films are so high. It is true that you VERY rarely follow actors, and should follow directors instead. Kurosawa obsessively disallows any and all failure or lack of ambition in his films, and this one is no different. His choking grip on the reins of his films may actually have contributed to his fatal stroke, but I'm no doctor. The one reason this film loses a 10/10 is because it is somewhat inaccessible. Whereas Shakespeare's iambic pentameter in many cases makes it difficult for neophytes to understand what is actually going on in the story, Kurosawa similarly steeps RAN so deep into Japanese culture that those who are not familiar with it WILL lose something in the translation. You'll understand what's going down, but there are so many layers that you just might not see because you don't know. My advice: Watch this film. Then, read the original Shakespeare, brush up on a little (it won't take much) on the proper etiquette for the bushi/samurai, doshin/bonge, buke/kuge, and hinen classes/castes, and you'll get a lot more from the experience. While you're at it, read up on the oyabun and kobun etiquette and obligations, Polish it off with a somewhat working knowledge of the system of conflict between Ninjo, Gimu, and Giri, and the film will mean a lot more to you. However, most will be unlikely to do so, so Kurosawa's RAN may be, as stated, inaccessible to many.",

He has the midas touch. His version of a story of betrayal and lust for film is a sight for the eyes, but also deeply critical of the human condition. Kurosawa had to go West for funding, but the result s scary and splendid.",
