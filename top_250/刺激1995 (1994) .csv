0,24 July 2010,hitchcockthelegend,10, Some birds aren't meant to be caged.,"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.",/

What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.",r

Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.",e

4,10 February 2006,kaspen12,10, A classic piece of unforgettable film-making.,"In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were ""just happy to be nominated."" Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word ""go,"" making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.",i
5,17 April 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10," Enthralling, fantastic, intriguing, truly remarkable!","Shawshank Redemption is without doubt one of the best films ever made, and definitely the best film of 1994. Yes, it is better than Lion King, and I really like that too. It is not only enthralling but powerful and moving too. I will confess that I didn't understand it when I first saw it as a lot happens in the film, and I have now seen it three times. I seriously hope, that those who ignored the film when it was first released now recognise it as a great film, as it really is. The dialogue was extremely well-written, with lines that really stick in your mind. The cinematography and music are both gorgeous, and the prison itself is like a character that dominates the film. In the script, there are some true elements of Stephen King Now I admit I am not a huge king fan, and usually don't like coarse language in books. But in his books like It, which is very good, I have accepted the language represents brutality and rebellion, shown perfectly in the film with the battle of acceptance I suppose between the inmates and the superiors(like the scene with the warden yelling coarse language at the new inmates lined up in a row at the beginning.)The acting was exceptional. I am not hugely familiar with Tim Robbins, but he did a great job in a very demanding role. The best performance however, comes from Morgan Freeman as Red, who was seriously robbed of that Oscar, that he lost to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump. Freeman reminds me very strongly, or his style of acting does, remind me of that of Sean Connery, suave yet very charismatic. Acting isn't just about your vocal range, it's about depth, which was what Freeman certainly had. In short, Freeman was brilliant in what could be his best performance. The scene where the inmates are listening to the Mozart aria over the speakers was a beautiful profound moment, and I actually cried in Brook's death scene. Very rarely do King adaptations translate-to screen well, because of the large scale of the author's books, with the exception of this and the Shining. Some like It and Dreamcatcher are genuinely memorable but have a number of flaws that prevent them from being classed as outstanding. And some, like Thinner and Tommyknockers that border on unwatchable. In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant film, that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for so-long. 10/10 of course. Bethany Cox.",e
6,25 March 1999,Coxer99,10, The Shawshank Redemption,"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.",w

12,30 July 2011,classicsoncall,10," ""I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning"".","Well I guess I'm a little late to the party as far as writing down a review for this picture. I've seen it a couple of times, but that was before I became a regular contributor to the IMDb. When I first discovered this site a few years ago, ""The Godfather"" was in the Number #1 spot, and since then the films have traded places for first and second, with Shawshank maintaining the top spot most of the time. That puzzled me a bit until I watched it again tonight, and I've come away from the picture with a new found appreciation. My favorite movies tend to be the story of underdogs in some way, shape or form, and my personal Top Ten list includes titles like ""On The Waterfront"", ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". I may have to reconsider that list, an infrequent exercise but one I don't mind doing every now and then as situations warrant.",9
13,6 February 1999,schnad,10," Simply known as ""The Movie""","Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as ""The Movie"".  When I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about.  In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"".  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history!  How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!""  There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my ""favorite of all time"", but they've all fallen far short of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.  You're guaranteed to find it in the ""employee picks"" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this movie, go see it again.  If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!",5
14,6 September 2000,reismark,10, Simply amazing. The best film of the 90's.,"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.",5

16,27 August 2002,weswalker,10, Shawshank Redeems Hollywood,"Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.",0

19,30 December 2007,blairgallop7,10, Hope can set you free and so can this remarkable film,"One of my favorite movies ever,The Shawshank Redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place.Based on a Stephen King novel,this movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the Warden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despise.This film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this fact.It was nominated for seven Academy Awards including (Best Picture, Best Actor Â– Morgan Freeman, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound) but didn't win any due to tough competition from the film Forrest Gump.I personally think that Tim Robbins should have been nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the performance of his career.Bravo to this brilliant modern day classic!",r

25,23 April 2015,Tweekums,10, A classic,"In 1947 Andy Dufresne is jailed for life for the murder of his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison where he tells his fellow inmates he is innocentÂ… but as fellow inmate 'Red' says; everybody in Shawshank is innocent. Red has already served ten years and is the guy to see if you want something smuggled into the prison. Andy asks for two things; a small rock hammer and Rita Hayworth! Soon after Red provides him with one rock hammer and a large poster featuring Rita Hayworth. Life in Shawshank is not easy; the guards are brutal and some of the inmates are worse. Andy survives though and things get better when he is able to help the meanest of the guards avoid paying tax on an inheritance; soon he is acting as accountant to the whole prison and helping the corrupt warden squirrel away large sums of money earned by prison labour. He is able to use this position to improve the life of prisoners too; a few beers for a work party, improvements to the prison library and education for some inmates. All the time Andy professes his innocence then one day after he has spent almost twenty years behind bars a young man comes to Shawshank; the man tells the story of how a cellmate at a previous prison claimed to have murdered a man and the woman he was with leaving her banker husband to take the blame. Andy believes this may finally get him out of prison but there is no way the warden will let him go; he is too useful and he knows too muchÂ… that won't stop Andy though.",t

Andy Dufresne, wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, finds the strength not only to change himself, but to bring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison.  This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion, from haunting and chilling, to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction, it is a triumph.  Field of Dreams was the first movie which invoked these emotions in me.  Shawshank Redemption is even more powerful for its simplicity.  It doesn't pretend to be clean, nor could it be called a family movie.  It is brutal and violent at times, horrifying and sickening at others. However the title says it all. Redemption is what this story is all about.  And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life.  What emerges can only be called a maginificent piece of art.  This is what movies were meant to be.",u

He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win. (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.",

The prison is a brutal place, and Andy is frequently beaten and sexually assaulted by a gang of homosexual inmates called ""The Sisters"". Two things, however, help him to survive. One is his friendship with another convict, Red, who has a reputation for being able to acquire almost any item and, for a price, to smuggle it into the prison. The other is his financial expertise, which he puts to good use, becoming a tax and financial adviser to the prison guards and even the Warden himself. As a reward for these services, Andy is given a privileged job in the prison library and protection from molestation. To avenge their attacks on Andy, the leader of the ""Sisters"" is so badly beaten by the guards that he is crippled for life; Andy is not molested again.",

What wonderful casting that was done to help this amazing story be told. Stephen King has a way about creating such memorable characters. For those of you who think this movie is a ""prison movie"" you are sadly mistaken. This movie merely takes place in a prison but this story is about so much more...friendship, hope, survival and dreams! There is a reason this movie is voted #1 on the IMDb site! Not only have I enjoyed watching this movie over a hundred times but I have been lucky enough to have been in that prison numerous times doing paranormal events. My last visit out there was last weekend and I decided to also go and visit all of the filming locations! That was a real treat!

It was so excellently written and acted, I really cared for all the characters and was truly heartbroken when Brooks died. So much time was given for the characters to develop and build friendship. The ending had such a long build up and was so extremely satisfying. I love how life in prison was portrayed, it was very interesting and got me invested into the story straight away. I thought after Andy was wrongly accused that the movie would focus more on him not being guilty, but it turned away from that and being more unique. The warden was an excellent character as well, he seemed nice at the beginning but slowly became more and more villainous and it really shows when watching.

The portrayal of friendship, the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope. Outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great.

Afterall Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are quite well-known actors. Frank Darabont however only just caught my attention in 1999, when 'the Green Mile' was released. Finally I came to the conclusion that it must have been either television, because it surely isn't on television often enough, or it could just be me, not knowing very much about the film-world before 1995. For in fact, everyone in my school seemed to have known 'the Shawshank Redemption' for a very long time. ""One of the best movies ever"", my best friend said, ""My favorite movie in the whole wide world"", another one of my friends. THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME!!!! I replied.

51,5 March 2016,Fella_shibby,10, This is one of the most inspiring n one of the greatest film.,"The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. I watched this movie for the umpteenth time. A movie I would never ever get bored of. Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption. Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison. The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I have heard. Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith. The more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more you learn from it. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest film. It has everything you could possibly want in a movie. If you don't love Shawshank, chances are you are beyond redemption. It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a masterpiece. It's in my top five movies of all time. I feel so bad about not writing a review of this masterpiece during the late nineties.",
52,31 July 2003,Matador07,9, One of the Best If You Get It,"People look for all sorts of things in movies, and you can see it in the occasional negative review that pops up for this movie.  Some viewers are looking for gritty realism in everything on the screen.  Others are action junkies.  Still others perhaps take film too seriously and reduce moviemaking to nothing more than a game of who can come up with the edgiest shot, or the niftiest angle.  For all of these, there is the very real chance that they simply will not ""get"" this film, and that's too bad -- they are missing out on a classic.",

54,11 September 2003,jaesboxer,10, Number two? Fine by me **** (out of ****),"I have long viewed the Shawshank Redemption as the most underrated film of all time.  That isn't to say that it wasn't universally acknowledged by the movie-going public as a great movie, but in terms of awards, critical acclaim, and best ever lists, this has somehow kept on losing out.  Now that I see it has the number two position, as voted by the movie-going public, on probably the most accurate best ever list in the world (AFI be damned), I am eminently pleased.  There is no way Forrest Gump should have won best picture over Shawshank.  Certainly, Forrest Gump is a charming, well-acted film, but it is nothing compared to this.  Morgan Freeman excels, and Tim Robbins turns in his best performance.  If you haven't seen this masterpiece, get up and rent it immediately.",

58,23 December 2012,jnelso19,10, Better Late Then Never,"Along with Q and Pulp Fiction, Frank Darabont (The Walking Dead original writer) and his debut film got screwed by the Hollywood Powerhouse that is Tom Hanks with this now can be considered an American Classic. The fact that this film barely and I emphasize barely made it's money back in US theaters (which is usually a signal for a film to turn into a DOA when released at home) and it made such a splash, that the film is exceeding what anyone thought a simple 18 years ago. This includes some of Hollywood's best critics including EW's Owen Gleiberman who originally gave the film a B- back in late '94. Yet over time, this story of redemption, like the rise of hope this film gives from beginning to end, grows on you to the point where at the very end, you have no choice but to clap (I clapped in my basement in front of my parents and I haven't looked the same since). Darabont found a formula that worked and it shows in his future films. He made Robbins human, made Morgan Freeman's voice as American as a Big Mac and made the late great Rita Hayworth relevant again. The only regret that one should have is the fact that if it was released two years later it would've swept away the Oscars (Sorry Ralph Fiennes, The English Patient won on a weak year.)",

I was channel surfing one evening - and stumbled across this movie. I watched a few minutes, thinking I would change channels at the first commercial. Almost 2 hours later - after seeing the end - I sat there...saying ""Wow"". That was a great movie. I have since recommended it to friends and family...it has grown in popularity due to word of mouth - and certainly deserves its spot at the top. Morgan Freeman put on a masterful performance, as did Tim Robbins. The way their friendship develops and the interplay with the other inmates - a wonderful story.",

It is really easy to understand the love for this movie. I'll admit, when it comes to movie adaptations of books, the book is always better. How can it not be? You get way more detail than could be crammed into a two-hour movie. However, I still thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation. Yes, it does deviate from the short a little with character changes and omissions, but I don't think this film could have been any better. I am in line with the ten-star reviews that I'm seeing and the only reason I am not giving this parable for hope a ten myself is because I don't as a rule.
Hope, aspiration, fighting the system, justice and humanism against the tyranny of the mainstream society/religion. This is the film.",
