0,25 July 2002,Quinoa1984,10, The Quintessential Bergman Picture,"One thing that can be certain after watching the Seventh Seal, outside of being thankful for living in this century, is that Bergman knows his film-making- and imagery.  He uses subliminal and not so subliminal techniques to convey a dying, frightened world, where making a living is almost impossible and the debate of god's control over life is discussed like un-rhyming yet fascinating poetry.

5,4 November 2000,jhclues,10, Compelling Drama From Ingmar Bergman,"A compelling contemplation of death and the nature of Man's existence, Ingmar Bergman's `The Seventh Seal' is uncompromising, riveting drama that is every bit as striking conceptually as it is philosophically.  In the Fourteenth Century a knight, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow), and his squire, Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand), have returned after ten years away at the Crusades to their native Sweden, and are beginning their journey home.  For Block, it is a pensive time; he is troubled by what he perceives as God's silence, and thirsts for knowledge and some meaning to his life, as well as a resolution of faith, which has deserted him.  Jons, meanwhile, is a study in jaded indifference, who believes in nothing beyond the present and whatever his senses and current circumstances dictate.  Shortly after their arrival on the coast of Sweden, Death (Bengt Ekerot) comes for Block.  But Block strikes a bargain with him, challenging him to a game of chess, to be played as they continue on with their journey.  As long as Block prevails, they will go on; if he wins, he will be released.  And though Block knows what the outcome must inevitably be, he welcomes Death's acceptance of his challenge, for the game affords him perhaps enough time to fulfill his quest, while adding purpose to what promises to be an arduous trek through a land being ravaged by the Black Plague. 	Von Sydow brings a commanding presence to the screen as Block, his very countenance bespeaking strength and poise.  His subtle, stoic approach to this enigmatic character is captivating, and lends a depth and dignity that makes Block truly memorable.  By contrast, Jons' strength seems born of his indifference; he takes things as they come, and is governed by a somewhat fatalistic philosophy.  Bjornstrand, a gifted, eloquent actor (and veteran of numerous Bergman films), invests an earthy, gritty quality to Jons that plays effectively opposite von Sydow's more ethereal portrayal of Block.  It is significant that in the closing scene the final speech, in the presence of Death, is accorded to Jons; for it elevates the character to a station equal to, if not surpassing, that of the protagonist, Block. 	The supporting cast includes Nils Poppe (Jof), Bibi Andersson (Mia), Inga Gill (Lisa), Gunnel Lindblom (Girl), Anders Ek (The Monk), Ake Fridell (Plog) and Erik Strandmark (Skat).  Written and directed by Bergman, `The Seventh Seal' is a thought provoking, earnest meditation on faith and mortality that is filled with stunning metaphoric and visual images that will forever be indelibly inscribed in your memory.  One scene in particular, in which the players link hands and, silhouetted against a twilight sky are led by Death in a dance across the crest of a distant hill, is breathtaking in it's simplicity.  It stands (as does this entire film) as an example of why Ingmar Bergman is one of the greatest directors in the history of the cinema.  I rate this one 10/10.",e
6,6 September 2005,bsinc,6, Didn't like it but will definitely see it again in the distant future,"First of all, I have taken the time to read some posts on this movie before writing my review because I was searching for lots of answers. Didn't get many though, the popular thing fans like to say (and please, no pun intended) is that it just takes time to understand and appreciate this movie. To this I quickly reply that my perception of ""Det Sjunde Inseglet"" was that it is a rather dull, if not eventless, movie. It has some really nice moments (and for some reason I really liked the concept of a man playing chess with death itself) but in the end almost nothing is resolved except from the main protagonist who, at the brink of his death, discovers that it's love that makes people want to live ,very roughly put, I apologize, but even this revelation was hidden from the writer of this comment. And this is what bothered me the most, I couldn't read (for the lack of a better word) any of these important details, the movie very coldly rolled in front of my eyes and I just didn't get it! Now the easiest and dumbest thing to say is that this is all the fault of the director for not having a more universal way of film-making, rather the viewer has to decipher such information if he wants to fully appreciate his movies. I've just realized that I could say the same for Kubrick's visionary movies, I didn't like most, scratch that, none of them the first time around, they grew on me after a second viewing. And I dig Kubrick, a lot!!!",w
7,19 November 2003,Captain_Couth,10, Top ten favorites. The Seventh Seal.,"Seventh Seal (1957) is one of my favorite movies. I have to rank it up there with A Touch of Zen, Seven Samurai and Battleship Potemkin. If there ever was such a thing as a perfect film, this one would have to be a nominee. I've never seen such a picture (and I probably never will) that was so moving, well shot, written, acted and directed. The chess game between the knight and death is an all-time classic. Words cannot describe how great this film is. There will never be another one like it. Truly amazing piece of celluloid.",/
8,31 August 2012,TheLittleSongbird,10, Fully deserves its rep as a masterpiece,"This is one amazing film, and in my view Ingmar Bergman's best. Visually, The Seventh looks wonderful, the bleak scenery adds much to the mood, the cinematography is beautifully composed and skillful and the lighting is atmospheric. It also has many memorable images like with the flagellates, the hawk flying in the cloudless sky, Jof's vision of the Virgin Mary and the milk and strawberries in the dusk. Bergman's direction is superb, Erik Nordgren's score is resolutely haunting and the dialogue is some of the most thought-provoking I've heard with some nice bawdy humour with especially the squire that doesn't feel misplaced. The story is like an allegory and meditation of life, death, love and fear(amongst other things), and it is dealt with in a very intelligent and careful manner. Again there are some timeless scenes like the ending, the scene of the girl about to be burnt, Death being challenged to a game of chess and with the jester. The acting is also exemplary, Max Von Sydow gives one of cinema's finest performances, stoic yet always commanding with a face that speaks volumes about what he's thinking. Bengt Ekerot evokes chills as Death, while Gunner Bjornstrand is suitably dry as the squire. All in all, a really amazing film, fully deserving of its reputation. 10/10 Bethany Cox",r
9,5 September 2006,Doylenf,6, Death never takes a holiday...,"While I'm not going overboard in extolling the virtues of THE SEVENTH SEAL, I do think it has some striking imagery and had the potential to be the ultimate work of art Ingmar Bergman was obviously striving for.

11,9 October 2014,Lejink,3," Death takes knight, checkmate.","I suppose one has to view the reputed great classics of cinema to sort of test one's critical faculties against established standards and coming to this iconic film I was certainly aware of some of its famous imagery, in particular that of the soldier playing chess with Death, but nothing more than this. It does make for an arresting start to the film but after that I found it rather heavy going I must say.",6
12,13 June 2005,planktonrules,9, Really weird but worth seeing for the experience,"This is a strange movie--period! However, it is also one of the most parodied films and for that reason alone it is worth seeing! Now, on to explain the part that is parodied: A man is returning from war in the time of the Reformation and the plague is about the countryside. The man meets the Angel of Death and is told it is him time to die. The man asks if he can first challenge him in a game of chess--if the man wins, then his life will be spared. The Grim Reaper, not wanting to be a spoilsport, agrees and they play a game that starts and stops again and again. This exact same contest has been used in Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey, the cartoon series The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, and an experimental film De Düva: The Dove (starring Madeline Kahn among others). In the Bill and Ted movie, they did not play chess but a series of games including Battleship and Twister! In The Dove, it was a badminton game! I can't remember what the game was in the cartoon series, but instead of their deaths, the children played the Grim Reaper over the soul of their pet hamster! Isn't is weird how this art film has appeared again and again and in the silliest of places! Give it a try to see the FIRST death-match and because it is a good film--with excellent performances all around--from Max Von Sydow to all the supporting players. Also, do not give up on the film too quick--I did and only saw it all years later when my sister-in-law convinced me to give it another try!",1
13,23 April 2006,johnmbale,10, Bergman's Brilliance Abounds,"What makes The Seventh Seal - an apocryphal and uncompromising fable of medieval Sweden - one of the masterpieces of Cinema ? Ingmar Bergman creates a believable world of dark happenings, wherein Death can play chess with a Knight, witches burn at the stake, with flagellants, and plague ever present. Through superb black and white images, each carefully composed for maximum effect, sets and costumes, his fine actors seem to truly inhabit this frightening world. Max von Sydow, Gunnar Bjornstrand, and Bengt Ekerot lead a marvelous cast. But its not all doom and gloom, as the Knight tries to determine in his quest, the meaning of life, and if God exists at all. There are moments of sheer happiness and peace, such as the sequence of the milk and strawberries at dusk, and a number of bawdy comic moments throughout the film. Which balances the darker side. It is unforgettable and I still remember seeing it on its first release, being stunned by the quality of the photography, and the performances. A restored version on DVD is recommended. Bergman is one of the great film makers of our time. Seldom today do we see such precise and considered images on the screen. Not to be missed.",0

16,9 December 2004,FilmOtaku,8, Intelligent and accessible with incredible imagery,"'I live now in a world of ghosts, a prisoner in my dreams', a line spoken by Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) in 'The Seventh Seal' is also a good descriptor of this critically lauded film. Directed by Ingmar Bergman, the film explores, through an allegorical fashion, human relationships and the struggle with ones own psyche. Block is a knight on his way home from the Crusades who becomes increasingly disillusioned while surveying his country, which has been ravaged by the Black Plague. Along the way he avers that he doesn't care about anyone, and questions the existence of a God who could allow these things to happen. In the beginning of the film he meets Death, who informs him that it is his time. Block manages to push off Death for a little while by distracting him with a chess game while he travels home; encountering several different characters, but Death is always following close behind until the inevitable end of the game.

17,7 January 2010,kenjha,5, Everything but the Kitchen Sink,"It is said that one can't avoid death and taxes. In this much praised allegorical film, a man tries to avoid death. Perhaps a film about a man avoiding taxes would have been more amusing. This film is episodic rather than having a narrative flow. It seems Bergman made a checklist of all the important themes and made sure he touched each one: love, marriage, infidelity, family, society, crime, punishment, and, of course, god and death. It is populated with Bergman regulars, including von Sydow as a knight who spews platitudes every time he opens his mouth. The cinematography is impressive. Otherwise, it's tough going for those who are not Bible scholars.",/

27,16 November 2015,Seraphion,4, It's quite a mediocre,"This may be because I've seen other 'talks with Death' movies such as Meet Joe Black, but I find this movie as mediocre at best. Yes the world depiction hit its mark very well, making the audience feel like they sunk into the gloomy world. But for me that's because the whole black and white color and the recurrence of the Death character. The main plot with Blok feels like it'll make this movie a challenging watch to those who pride their faith. What made me rate it a score f 4 is the sub plots that makes this movie look simply stupid. Again maybe this is a cultural gap issue between me and 1950s Sweden, but I fail to understand how Plog's stupidity can have a good impact to the whole story. One thing to add is that I tend to agree with the opinion about the acting. Max von Sydow and Bengt Ekerot did a splendid job in their roles here that helped a lot in setting up the movie's mood.",u
28,2 January 2017,moonspinner55,7," ""You are black."" .. ""It suits me well.""","Ingmar Bergman's career of brooding cinematic successes was practically borne here, in an amazing study of doomsday travelers in 14th century Sweden confronting their mortality. In the age of the Black Plague, the streets are filled with pagans, drunks, artisans, performers, religious zealots and volunteer witch-burners; a knight and his squire, home from the Crusades, stop at the ocean, where a most benign Grim Reaper tells the knight he has been at his side for a long while. They engage in a winner-take-all game of chess, though the knight is just biding time to save the friends he has made from Death's clutches. The barbarism and cruelty aside, writer-director Bergman does show a streak of pithy black humor, resulting in some amazing sequences (such as the juggler cut down from a tree by Death and his scythe). The overlay of brutality in the name of Christianity, the torment of faith and the heavy symbolism are often tough to wade through, while the metaphor of the chess game has left the picture open for parody. Still, ""The Seventh Seal"" is a must-see film, matching its iconic imagery with themes of the eternal struggle. *** from ****",r

30,4 June 2007,Galina_movie_fan,8," Antonius Block: ""I met Death today. We are playing chess.""","Dark, beautiful, meaningful, exploring the most serious themes of faith and searching for God, ""The Seventh Seal"" is known as one of the landmark Bergman's movies. One of the film's inspirations was a painting that Bergman saw as a young boy and was transfixed by: ""There was everything that one's imagination could desire. Angels, saints, dragons, prophets, devils, humans. There were very frightening animals: serpents in paradise, Balaam's ass, Jonah's whale, the eagle of Revelation. All this was surrounded by heavenly, earthly and subterranean landscapes of strange yet familiar beauty. I remember Death playing chess with a Crusader, Death sawing at a tree to a branch of which clung a naked man with staring eyes, and across a gentle hill Death leading the final dance towards the dark lands"" (Bergman in Hart). The film follows the journey of a knight Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) returning from Crusades through Sweden ravaged by plague. The knight has lost his faith in the blood and horrors of the battlefield, ""Faith is a torment. It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call."" On his way home, he encountered people dying from starvation and disease, being burnt as witches as well as Mr. Death himself who challenged him to play a game of chess and the family of a happy juggler, his wife, and their infant son. This family is happy because they love each other. They represent the simple joys and hopes of ordinary life. ",
31,24 April 2010,JoeytheBrit,9, Medieval Road Movie,"Back from the Crusades (where he no doubt carried out some unspeakable acts in the name of God) Antonius Block (Max von Sydow), discovers his homeland ravaged by the plague as he struggles with a crisis of faith. As if that wasn't bad enough, he also runs into Death on the beach, and challenges the reaper to a game of chess to buy himself a little time as he wrestles with metaphysical conundrums. The duel, played on a beach beneath lowering skies, provides us with one of cinema's enduring images and, perhaps, misleads us about the true nature of Bergman's film. I'd always assumed it to be a grim, dour affair with dull, lengthy periods of intellectualising. Well, the film is certainly bleak, but it's also completely absorbing and rewarding.",
32,24 October 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6, Portentous yet intriguing.,"Death is the major theme of this 'The Seventh Seal (1957)', with the great plague backdrop acting as an apocalyptic omen for almost everyone involved. The piece is dripping with portent, a low-key but tangible melancholy that's almost oppressive. It's bleak, for sure. It's certainly not fun. Of course, it isn't supposed to be. Instead, it aims to tackle its taboo head-on. It doesn't provide easy answers, with the spectre of the grim reaper seeming to exist entirely separately from any from of God. The search for God is also a major theme. Each character has a unique relationship with their faith, which evolves over the course of the plot. No view is ever expressed as 'right'; it's simply what the character believes. The overall result of the picture is downbeat, despite some moments of hope. Though it feels loose and segmented, it undeniably has an effect. It leaves you with a melancholy that's difficult to explain. In the moment, however, it's never hugely engaging. It's not bad, but it doesn't really connect with you on a conscious level. Obviously, it must resonate in some way in order to leave you feeling the way it does. It's just that the cold, meditative discussions that make up its narrative aren't often all that compelling. Neither are the odd set-pieces which actually feel somewhat 'random'. It has its moments and isn't constantly grim. When the portentous stuff gets more overt, it's really effective. A scene of mass self-harm is genuinely rather upsetting, for example. Thankfully, the piece doesn't always deal in overt sadness. The previously mentioned moments of hope help to elevate its dour effect, making for a relatively rounded experience. In the end, its message is about acceptance rather than doom. No matter which way you cut it, though, it's still quite bleak. At least it has the guts to tackle something that most people actively try to avoid. As I said, it's not fun. 6/10",

It is a unique film, and unlike any I have ever seen. I have just finished my second viewing of the film. I have watched several Bergman films since I first saw this, but this is the one that has always stuck out to me the most. I would describe it as a dark and powerful film. There is nothing lacking in this film, in my opinion. The soundtrack is perfectly subtle, acting is agreeable, cinematography fitting and well done, etc. My favorite aspect of this film is simply the premise. A game of chess that is a matter of life and death. If nothing else, that concept is enough to make an interesting film at the very least. Death is the most persistent theme throughout the film, and is often juxtaposed to stark scenes of life, often quickly and without warning. This film was one of the first I watched in my everlasting pursuit of classic cinema, and I would readily recommend it as a starting point for anyone interested in classic or foreign films. Bergman will not disappoint in this one or elsewhere in his filmography. This is probably his most famous and accessible films. This is a staple of classic cinema, watch it and find out why.",

It looks good enough that people believe that there just has to be some substance floating around in there somewhere, but I'll be darned if I'll ever be able to point any of it out. Because of Bergman's recent death, I once again had a chance to see it on TCM. And once again I barely made it past the ""famous"" opening scene with Death playing chess on the beach. I finally do have one thing figured out though. The opening scene is the best known scene from the film because hardly anyone can get beyond it. Oh sure, the Black Leather Art Crowd will tell you they watched the whole film, but don't believe it. They watch that stupid Death plays chess on the beach scene, rate the film a ""10"" and then post a glowing review here on IMDb to prove they know art when they see it!

44,3 September 2020,Horst_In_Translation,6," Haunting as well as entertaining, even if I did not see true greatness","""Det sjunde inseglet"" or ""The Seventh Seal"" is a Swedish movie from 1957, so this one is already way over half a century old, and it is also in the Swedish language, even if there is some Latin in here too, but really not too much. It runs for slightly over 1.5 hours, but stays under the 100-minute mark, so it is definitely not among the longest films out there. The director is of course Ingmar Bergman, considered by absolutely everybody Sweden's finest filmmaker ever, considered by many Europe's finest filmmaker ever and considered by some the world's finest filmmaker ever. He is also once again the writer. The writer of the play this is based on and also the writer of the specific screenplay. As you can see from the pretty cool poster this is a black-and-white movie, which is not a given for mid/late 1950s, but also not to be taken for granted. Bergman was still under the age of 40 when he made this movie that received a great deal of awards recognition, for example at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. Sadly, he is of course long gone now and same is true for almost all the cast members in here. Lindblom is still alive I see, but I must say there are only two names here that I recognize and Bergman fans will certainly recognize a lot more.",

Ingmar Bergman's most celebrated work, admired and indirectly copied by many (the figure of Death created here was imitated in countless productions), remains as an essential work, one of a kind. It's something that will never lose its importance, it'll always be relevant no matter the decade, the century or whatever because it works themes that are the main doubt of the human race since its existence, the issue that few are open to discuss all knowing that is going to happen one day: death.

52,23 February 2019,calspers,8, Very interesting script but not exactly touching,This philosophical fantasy film from Ingmar Bergman I found really interesting on several levels.,
53,19 January 2010,Ziya90,5, The idea remained abstract,"When I read the plot of The Seventh Seal years years before, I sured that when I get a chance to watch it, I would be definitely impressed. The idea of playing chess with death is very inventive, brilliant, but if you put it in a good story. Ingmar Bergman was the best director to do that in the best way, but this time, impossible to accept, he could not turn the idea to good account. The movie's content is not about playing chess with death, this is very important. This is just a sub story. Yes, the film is not about the fellowship of two chess players anyway, but when I read the man who plays chess with death, I supposed that the story would be like: one day, a crusader encounters death. Death requires a chess game, if the man wins, he is set free, if the death does, the man dies. The chess game continues for months and till the game ends, his questions about life, death and God are answered. In the end, the man loses. The whole movie focuses on this deadly chess game with certain intervals. In these intervals, you also can show us the villagers who are suffered from plague. It might sound weird, but this had been my expectation. After the first thirty minutes, the story is scattered, collapsed, then we loose our attention, because the movie changes its route. As a result of this, the potential of the story gets out of hand. We are forced to forget the crusader, the crusader's situation. Bergman is not interested in this character enough and also the chess game that seems the heart of the movie, but it is not and it should have been. The chess game cannot be named as a metaphor, because, this is not the point, thus the image which the man who plays chess with death exists as just an image. The crowd make a celebration, they start to sing a song, there is a husband and wife, I mean we see pictures desultory from each other. Those pictures are like theater, but in contrast, not dramatic, not impressive at all. This is the story of 'black death' more, not death. As for direction, only one sentence can summarize the film: the way of storytelling is not powerful. By the way, the crusader encounters the death and the death says I am death, look at the reaction of him; nothing. He is like OK, what's that to me? Sorry, but the name of this is not art. It is stressed that he is a nihilist? However, it looks unconvincing at the end. This is not so important, but this scene deserves to be dramatic. I watched The Virgin Spring and Smultronstallet after The Seventh Seal in order to rehabilitate and I did. Lastly, almost everyone writes the same thing: the film questionnaires the meaning of life, death, faith and the existence of God. Some films have a repetitious sentence and The Seventh Seal's sentence is this. Another commonly used word for the film is symbolism. I cannot give a movie 10 out of 10 owing to only its symbols and themes.",

55,8 August 2005,selfparody,2, Bergman's use of theatricality shoots himself in the foot,"What could have been the best movie of the 1950s is mitigated by not sticking with what it did right. Bergman could have documented the effects of the plague on citizenry of Sweden with a harsher, more real tone and had the religious issues be discussed, but instead he reversed that, and a much weaker movie is the result. (The hideous plague is simply not established strongly enough: one corpse, while a nice quick scare, doesn't establish enough since so many other people just seem to go about their business fine, never mind that roughly one fourth of them are supposed to be dying) The extremely moody opening: waves, rocky beaches, barren, a a knight drained of strength sprawled on the beach, a great attention grabber. And then, the appearance of a dark caped, white faced man, and BANG, the movie hits a huge snag.",
56,1 January 2021,Cineanalyst,10, The Seventh Art,"Quintessential European art film reminding us that we're all going to die while God is silent though it is, ""The Seventh Seal"" is typical of Ingmar Bergman's oeuvre in being visually striking, and it might just feature the most dramatic narrative construction from his career--and one of the most impressive in film history. There's an entire chess board of pieces and game of moves going on in the plotting. It's sublime how all the subplots and themes efficiently come together in the taut journey and every part entangled and multi-layered: the repetition of the titular sevens quotation from the Book of Revelations and even complemented by an emphasis on dissolves at the beginning and near the end; the multitude of Deathly imagery from Death himself and his guises to painted image, mask and skull; cuckoldry and dance on and off stage; the proscenium arch of the stage and shore, the frame of the fresco and prisoner stocks; and the seven plots of the knight and his squire, the troupe of performers, the thief and the mute housekeeper, the cuckold blacksmith and his wife, the procession of flagellants, the witch burning, and the chess game with Death. Largely, all the seven arts are here, too: actors playing actors, song and dance, the danse macabre of the church fresco, as well as all the rest of the architecture and Christian iconography and the Good Book--until it all goes up in the flames of a sight analogy in search of the seventh art that is motion pictures.",

However allegory can be handled skillfully, or it can be a heavy-handed exercise in preaching. Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece centers on a meeting between Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow), a knight returning from the Crusades, and Death (Bengt Ekerot). Emotionless, pasty-faced and vaguely sardonic, Death is tricked into staying his scythe when Block challenges him to a game of chess. Full of haunting, iconic images and a touch of humanity, ""The Seventh Seal"" is cinema at its most artful, a philosophical meditation on the meaning, or meaningless of mortality. ",

60,4 June 2004,Bergmaniac,9," Great, but far from Bergman's best","I find it strange that ""The seventh Seal"" has always been widely considered to be the best Bergman movie and is so much more famous that all the others he made. Yes, it's very good, especially for its time, but compared with the real masterpieces Bergman made like ""Wild Strawberries"", ""Through a Glass darkly"", ""Persona"", ""Winter light"" and ""Fanny and Alexander"", it really pales in comparison. The ideas and the questions asked in this movie are pretty interesting and profound, but I feel that Bergman has done so much better in his later movies on similar subjects. The theme about the God's silence is much, much better developed in the famous ""Faith Trilogy"", especially ""Through a glass darkly"" and ""Winter light"". The theme about how to cope with fear of death is well developed, but couldn't really convince me. Also I feel that the film has too many ""comic relief"" moments.  Many people have praised the cinematography in this movie, quite a few saying that it's one of the best ever. I beg to disagree. It's very, very good, excellent at times, but again Bergman has done so much better in his other movies. Personally I feel that the cinematography in Bergman's movies improved when he changed his director of photography Gunnar Fischer(who worked on this movie and ""Wild Strawberries"") with Sven Nykvist. Watch ""Through a glass darkly"" or ""Persona"" if you want a really stunning cinematography. But even ""Wild Strawberries"", made shortly after ""The Seventh seal"" and looking visually quite similar, is better IMO. Here the settings and the lighting looks too theatrical to me for most of the times. Of course, there were quite a few memorable images, especially the start with Death on the beach, the dance with Death at the end, the procession of the fanatics who whipped themselves through the village,etc. But still, something was lacking in many of the scenes. Bergman had to shoot the whole movie in just 35 days, so it's understandable IMO. After being so critical to the movie so far, it's time to mention its strong points. They are typical of Bergman's movies. Very strong acting(especially from Max von Sydov), amazing dark medieval atmosphere, really makes you think about the important questions. The music was very well and effectively used too. It's a great movie, no doubt, and it established Bergman as one of the all-time greats, which is big plus for a huge fan of him like myself. Still, my advice is: don't limit your Bergman experience to just this movie, watch his others, many of them are even better. 9/10",

Most of his films have provoked heated discussions from cinema fans regardless of the fact whether they have liked them or not.If one observes Ingmar Bergman's career closely it would be revealed that almost all of his films were based on themes which were close to his heart.No artist in the history of mankind has efficiently tackled death,faith,religion,male-female relationship,memories,suffering etc as it was done by Ingmar Bergman.Det Sjunde inseglet is one of those eclectic films which give hope,joy and trust in human faith.The Seventh Seal has been called an existentialist classic.This is true to some extent but for Bergman it was simply an affair of reaffirming his faith in the influence of religion on ordinary mortals.His influence was so great that even death had been given a human face.",

People must live their lives in constant fear. Of course, the ones flourishing are those connected to the church. When people are desperate, that's where they end up. There is no moral sense at work in the land because death is literally around the corner, played by a round faced character in a black cowl. Max Van Sydow's knight is a fine character who manages to play a game of chess with Death and put off the inevitable. During that time he encounters a group of scoundrels and some very nice people who don't deserve their fate. Bergman's images are incredible. He does more with black and white film than darn near anyone. There is a preponderance of religious symbolism. Most of what I remember is that amazing power generated by the church, the burnings and the fear tactics. When Death comes, after the fear has been exhausted, there seems to be a comfortable acceptance because the life on earth is certainly not worth much.",

The contradictory nature of man, wickedly intelligent and self-aware on the one hand, a stupid, superstitious and easily manipulated idiot on the other, is what makes the plight of our heroes so simple and yet so profound. In essence, we are asked to respond to God's silence in assured faith, a contradiction to common sense that has somehow has manacled our essence from time immemorial. What is more, this flick flirts with such conundrum by account of the simplicity of not seeking answers but instead a purpose. Indeed! This flick is at times a cacophony of relentless imagery punctuated by wonderful humor and witty dialog. The acting was simply aces on all accounts. Ingmar Bergman's direction hits the bulls eye here, crafting an impossible concept into a convincing and highly enjoyable flick that cannot help but move any human with breathe still gracing his lungs.

Antonius Block has just returned from the crusades and encounters Death, but instead of seeing a cul-de-sac he tries to win time by playing chess with him. As Death is very busy he has to run in and out of the game. Meanwhile Antonius tries to find out if there is a God that can save him, for which a clear answer he of course is not given. On the way however he stumbles into a acting couple that experience true happiness that makes him forget for a little while what he's running from.

Basically, a medieval knight plays a game of chess with Death, while exploring a backdrop of plague-stricken medieval europe. The dialogue was well-crafted, the acting was fine, and the scenery was good for the time. I think what I disliked about this one was the minimalist tone. Basically, there's not much music, no great stakes, no twists or huge plot points. It feels like the story is following the daily life of the hero, rather than any conflict he's confronting. The ending feel inevitable from the start, the emotions feel muted, and the mood is depressing (despite a few humorous segments that feel forced).

112,6 June 2006,The_Triad,7, I got something for you to chew over,"The Seventh Seal is a very difficult film to review, it is a very powerful film that raises a lot of questions for the viewer to consider and it achieves that aim very well, but it doesn't really do much else. The Seventh Seal has a large cast of characters who all come together within the film's vague plot (a Knight returning home from the crusades, who plays a game of chess with Death along the way), it does feel as though some characterisation has been lost somewhere as a result of the little screen time given to each one, personally I would have liked to have got to known these characters a bit more, but it is not really necessary for the viewer to do so for the film to achieve it's aims. Which is basically for the viewer to examine himself and ask questions about what will happen when we die. With the main character of the Knight taking to asking most of the questions, as he is desperate to find out where he will go when he succumbs to Death's checkmate. As, ultimately, these questions are not answered in the film, it means that a lot of the impact The Seventh Seal has takes place off screen, in it's prompting of the viewer to ask this for themselves. Can it be that all that's waiting for us is nothing? One of philosophy's most asked questions, and to be honest, one that most human beings have asked themselves from a young age, so most of the dialogue on this subject can hardly be called especially profound. The dialogue is quite philosophical heavy, as you might expect, and does help provide a good amount of interest in the film, the cinematography and acting too, are very good, most notably Max Von Sydow's performance. Not one to watch to entertain your mates, The Seventh Seal is a well made philosophical piece that will give the viewer something to think about, ultimately they have thought about it before so it's nothing new, but more a cold reminder that Death is waiting.",

So while this film is in many top 100 lists this does not necessarily mean you will enjoy it. This film caused much controversy when it was released, and still to this day, because of its anti-god and anti-religious views. For instance, the only divine being that we ever see is death. The character of death is well written and well acted, and scenes he is in a very memorable. The film can be very boring and seemingly shallow when you are not fully analysing every image, but if you think that it is not a bad film it is just a film that you will not enjoy, no matter how many times you rematch it. The camera-work though is very memorable, and I really like that the camera always still. It makes the world feel more empty, and this is really absorbing. My final impression on the film is mixed. I love the character of death, and I love the isolated feel of the world, but the film does have section where the film just slows down and even lacks memorable images, which is exactly what the film tries to achieve. I also do not like the massive character list, which makes the film feel stuffed and the 95 minute runtime means that each character has virtually no character development. I still recommend you watch it though.",
119,13 December 2005,vishal_wall,8, Religion Vs Art,"'Seventh Seal' is a complex movie. After having fought for 10 years a 14th century crusader (Max Von Sydow) starts questioning the existence of God itself and decides to go back home. On his way back he meets death. Von Sydow challenges death to play chess with him. If he wins he lives else death can claim his life. While this game is going on Sydow meets a singer, his wife and his son. Singer has power to see supernatural things which even his wife doesn't believe in. Sydow sees the impact of religion on normal people and misery of a common man. By the end of the movie he is shown losing to death. I don't want to give away the end of the film although it's so weird that you might see it in a different light altogether. It's a very responsible cinema. Despite the fact that movie asks an orthodox question ""IS there God?"" It comes out without answering the question but in a convincing way. The whole of actor's track is in layers. My interpretation of the actor being able to see supernatural is that artists have a better sense of life and so they have an ability to interpret regular incident in a more comprehensive way. I am sure there are other interpretations too. Stage performance followed by a Christian procession is a powerful sequence. Bergman has tapped the insignificance of art in Europe in the 14th century in this track. Movie becomes slow after a point but reaches at a well deserved climax. For me actor's track is the highlight of the film. Crusader, death and religion have been talked about in several movies but its one rare movie which talks about importance (rather lack of) of art during the dark age of Pope Mafia. It is a must watch for a person who wants to understand the negative impact of religion on the 'herd' psychology of people. This movie made me wonder what would have happened if Renaissance didn't happen. This is one of those movies where 5 persons come out with 5 different statements about the movie.",
120,2 June 2018,adam-may-bower,10, Masterpiece,"'The Seventh Seal' is a metaphorical masterpiece by Ingmar Bergman. This film is a brilliant artwork that asks big existential and religious questions that every human being as pondered some point in their life. Set in the harrowing and dim Middle Ages during the Black Plaque, Bergman captivates his audience into a world of anger, fear, sorrow and doubt and engages the audience in an beautiful narrative that follows the troubled knight Antonius Block, played brilliantly by Swedish actor Max von Sydow. While the film is evidently dated, it has never lost it's remark-ability. It almost seems incomparable with modern films today. Scene after scene, Bergman's philological film takes it's audience on a journey with it's characters and even though it may ask many questions and leave few answers, you leave the film feeling more knowledgable on your life and where you are headed. The brilliancy of this film is that Bergman does not try to convince his audience to believe his ""protestant atheist"" views, but rather just show them. He presents atheistic views one character, and then a faithful, religious view another leaving this film to be unbiased and essentially encourages individuals of any view to think with an open mind.",

The plot is smart and interesting, and it is compelling from start to finish. During a game of chess between The Grim Reaper itself and the man he has come to take, subjects like faith, life and death are explored. It's rather compelling, and ought to inspire many a healthy debate about aforementioned broad topics. The open and seemingly ambiguous nature of the movie allows the audience to interpret it for ourselves. This is funny at points, once or twice from absurdity, and it never tries too hard. It comes naturally, the clever and witty material as well as the black comedy. The acting is excellent, not a single performance is off for a second. It's really cool to see Sydow, by all respects a great talent, in his native tongue. This is beautifully shot and skillfully edited, if the sound can be a tad excessive at times. The music does also get loud and over the top a little, though it does not put much of a strain on the viewing experience. There is disturbing content in this, as well as brief violence and a few gruesome visuals. The DVD contains an introduction with Ingmar himself, which is three minutes long.

From this site, I know that ""Persona"" rating is lower than ""Det sjunde inseglet"", so at the first I just learn to love the lower one. And from that, I can enjoy the higher rated movies from Bergman more. Imagine a baby, at first it is fed by breast milk, next the porridge. Until its teeth grow, it can eat bread, even meat. There are always some stages in life, and in movie's appraisal too. I just want to grow my teeth first. And then I can ""eat"" the other Bergman's movies. So, if you can't enjoy this movie, don't get too resistant, try to be more tolerant. It's old, Swedish, and very different from the nowadays movie, from the content to the cinematography. Like I said before, grow your teeth first, learn to enjoy unusual movie like this. I recommend this for you who want to takes cinema rather seriously.

The second Bergman film I saw was Persona; again I just didn't fully grasp the film and in my naivety, belittled the staggering work of art I now hail it as by saying that it needed to make sense.  I know understand Bergman's work a little better, and understand that The Virgin Spring was Bergman's least personal film, and one that he accepted as a director for hire. Persona on the other hand is often credited as the director's most complex and experimental film, open to interpretation and definitely not a film for all tastes.

Basically knight Antonius Block (Sydow) and his squire Jöns (Gunnar Björnstrand) have returned home from the crusades, where the Black Death is spreading. Antonius comes face to face with Death (Bengt Ekerot), literally, who tells him his number is up, but the knight challenges the dark figure to a game of chess for his life. This game continues throughout the film as cultural turmoil ensues around Antonius, and there are quite a few dark references to the existence of God and the Devil, and the very essence of faith. Through the film, you see travelling actors doing some weird voodoo play looking as though their praising the Devil, a Witch (Maud Hansson) is burned alive, violence is used to stabilise order and a few other dark occurrences. But the dark stuff is balanced out by a few light hearted and spiritual events, you can see Jof / Joseph (Nils Poppe) and his young wife Mia / Mary - Jof's wife (Bibi Andersson) with their infant son Mikael are meant to represent the Holy family. As far as I remember, Antonius gives away his idea for a winning move, as he knows he is most likely to lose the chess game anyway, and I'm guessing he does. Also starring Anders Ek as The Monk and Erik Strandmark as Jonas Skat. Being a Swedish film, it wasn't easy to understand most of what was going on, but looking back I can understand the religious messages that director Bergman (father of Ingrid) was trying to get across, and it is a most watchable classic period drama.

My initial thoughts were that it was a great film with great cinematography and very well executed it's themes of death and questioning of faith/religion and its meaning, and that's probably exactly what it is. However, I feel like it's more than that. Some of the symbolism that was distinguished throughout this film probably flew over my head, however I am aware that it was there. On a technical level, this is a masterpiece, just like many of the other foreign black and white films I've watched recently. But, once again, this was just not my kind of movie. A tad boring and too artsy, you have to constantly be hooked to something that may not interest you all that much. I COMPLETELY understand everyone's love for it and the high ratings, but art films like this one are just not NECESSARILY my cup of tea.

In a parallel way we see a group of people that share the same world, exposed to the same risks but instead of giving themselves to death even before being caught, they continue to live their life and worship it. The main character specially prefers to understand it instead of letting himself be scared by it. The entire story, the characters and the scenario make this movie brilliant and a gift for those who love cinema. The fact that it's in black and white gives it a certain mystery that nowadays movies sometimes lose. This movie is a perfect example that aren't big scenes, big visual effects or famous actors that make a good movie. I most certainly advise it but for those who aren't accustomed to see this kind of movie, keep your mind opened to different ways of presenting a story and ending it.",

149,25 July 2013,tomassparups,9, Bleak beauty.,"I have stated many times that Ingmar Bergman is one of my favorite film makers of all time. I, like many others, see him as a visionary, a shining example of an amazing film maker. His films are like no other's, there are layers beyond layers that can only hope to be unraveled in his works. Few film makers have achieved such artistic success as Bergman and few ever will. Though his films may share similar themes, they all bear their own drastically defining characteristics. ""The Seventh Seal"" is a film I first saw nearly a year ago and did not fully appreciate until I revisited it more recently. Bear in mind that this like most or Bergman's films require multiple viewings to even begin a discussion. In the first scenes of the film we see a vast seashore and a knight awaking on it. He is approached by a mysterious hooded figure that reveals himself as Death. The knight, Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) has recently returned from the Crusades to a plague infested Sweden. Death claims that he has come for him and that his time in the world of the living is up. In order to hinder Death's deed, Antonius proposes a game of chess between the two. If he is to win the game, Death will set him free. The film also follows a wide variety of other character's that towards the end come together. When reviewing an Ingmar Bergman film, I don't care to greatly indulge on the plot, especially with this film, as I fear it will take away from the film's charm.",

On the other hand I am gradually making headway via DVD, revivals, festivals, etc. Time was I felt deprived because I hadn't seen Citizen Kane, Casablanca, It's A Wonderful Life, The Wizard Of Oz, for God's sake but like I say they're all now safely under my belt and I feel the better for having caught up with them eventually. In the case of Bergman it's not just The Seventh Seal but practically everything he ever made that, for one reason or another, I haven't seen; in fact off the top of my head I can recall seeing only Smiles Of A Summer Night and Autumn Sonata. Nor, if I'm honest, have I made any great attempt to watch him, most of the films are now available on DVD but I'm not exactly breaking a leg rushing to Virgin, FNAC or HMV but now The Seventh Seal has just opened commercially in London so, along with 8 other people I checked it out, exactly 50 years after it was released. The first thing I noticed was that it's not quite as grim as I had supposed and nor is the celebrated chess game given that much screen time - from all I'd read over the years I'd imagined a fairly static movie with these two symbolic characters trading moves for 90 minutes. Taint, so, honey, taint so. Following some portentous music we find ourselves on a craggy beach where the knight, Antonius Block, is resting. Beside him on a piece of fairly flat rock a chess board has been set up. This is a pretty unrealistic image with which to kick off a non-comedy film because no normal person would set out a chessboard in such an inhospitable place where the more or less constant wind would scatter the pieces every which way in nothing flat. So now Bergman has to get us past this incongruity and I guess that having 'Death' appear in human form and accepting a challenge from Block - who can forestall his date with Death for the duration of the game and even cancel it altogether should he win - is as good a way as any. We then accompany Block and his squire as he returns home after ten years away from his wife - he's been to the Crusades if anybody asks you - which immediately reminds us of Agammemnon returning home to HIS wife after ten tough years in Troy and the Fall of the House of Atreus is as nought compared to the angst that visits Block. The images are striking at times, the acting is more than accomplished and in fact the only jarring note is just that, in fact not just one note but the several that make up the score which has a habit of SHOUTING at us when it wants to underline something instead of employing a more subtle approach. It's nice to be able to cross it off my list but I won't be breaking my neck to see it again and nor am I likely to buy the DVD.",

I mean, nothing in it seems to be there without any reasons or a deep meaning. Maybe i'm reading too much on it, but maybe not. Remember that we are talking about Ingmar Bergman. And technically it is, as well, a very well made film. A beautiful film, in fact. The cinematography is stunning, with some wonderful shots, it has an impressive work in the edition as well, a very macabre soundtrack, which adds a certain dark(even darker) atmosphere to the film. The acting is impressive, a bit over the top, but still good. It may be not 100% entertaining all the time, but I'm sure that it can be an easily watchable experience even for those who don't have that much interest in this kind of films.

To this day, it is still the most terrifying film in cinema history. The second most terrifying is Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" (1979). I saw both when they were released on the big screen.

As for my students, it's more than the usual black and white, strange language problem that all film teachers now recognize.  It seems to me to be part of the post-modern ""understanding"" that all meaning is as random as any other meaning, and that the search for God is a fake.  In many ways I accept that notion, as it does fit in with the way the universe seems to be.  My students watch Antonious Blok, and don't understand what his problem.  (Bergman did understand that view, and created the character of Jons the squire, as a fill-in for the modern cynic.)  Each time I show the film, and see it again for myself, I ask myself if in really is more than my own 60's romanticism, when we were discovering life.  There are some films which I stop showing.

What comes as a surprise it that the movie's most iconic image comes in the very first scene; that the philosophical debates take the form of wisecracks; and that Max von Sydow's character is actually among the least interesting in the story. Indeed, with a measure of (deliberate) overplaying, a mediaeval setting and some surprisingly bawdy and direct humour, the film even resembles one of Shakespeare's comedies, albeit an unusually black one. The sub-plot about a group of actors making a play about death, a story within a story, seems especially Shakespearian.

Brief Review -",
180,29 April 2020,andrewroy-04316,7," Rife with ambiguity and symbolism, The Seventh Seal is a detached intellectual experience","The Seventh Seal is a movie that seems to be all about symbolism and ambiguous existential musings. It's set in 12th century Europe, as patriarchal Catholic society is the norm and the plague is ravaging the land. Our primary plot line is our protagonist, The Knight, struggling with his faith and plays a chess game with Death to determine whether he can extend his life. He is presented in stark contrast to Jof and Mia, a married couple with a kid who are far less concerned with faith and existentialism than The Knight is. The discussions between The Knight and Death were my favorite scenes in the movie, as we understand The Knight's point of view better and, like the rest of the film, the conversation has deeper meanings. The Knight is frustrated by the silence and absence that God is in his life, and badly wants to know the truth of his nature. Death, however, says that he knows nothing. The existential questions of whether a God exists, whether he cares, and whether there is a larger purpose to life are central to the film, and while there is ample room for interpretation, I think Bergman intended to show that seeking a faith-based connection in life is futile, and the only meaning that exists in the world is that which you impart, primarily from your human connections. The Knight is always shown as completely independent from others, even his traveling partner of 10 years, while Mia and Jof are happy because they value their art and shared bond. While The Knight looks for something greater, they accept their life as it is. The backdrop of the plague adds another layer to the symbolism of the film - it emphasizes the hollowness of the church's claims. The church says that those who do good will be rewarded and sinners punished, but of course the plague is indiscriminating. I still need to grapple much more with the ideas of the film, because it's so dense and layered, but my experience with the film was a purely intellectual one. It had its moments of levity (which could have been inspirations for Monty Python), but for the most part was a detached experience in understanding the complex meanings behind scenes and dialogue, rather than a personal or emotional connection to the story. There's nothing wrong with that, and my thoughts on the film will surely evolve as I interpret more parts of the film, but it did feel heavy in philosophy and symbolism.",

Overall, the film explores the inevitability of death using stunning visual metaphors and suggests that there are not necessarily any answers to be found about God and death.",

189,13 December 2022,jamesrupert2014,9, Beautifully filmed allegory on faith and death - bleak but occasionally quite funny,"Drifting through a plague-ravaged Europe, a weary crusader recently returned from the wars of the faiths (a lean, laconic Max von Sydow), delays the icy hand of an anthropomorphic Death (Bengt Ekerot) for one day in the hope of Devine deliverance from ignorance and of making his last moments count for something. Travelling with the morose Lord is his cynical, secular squire (an excellent Gunnar Björnstrand), an actor with the second sight (Nils Poppe) and his small family, and a cuckolded smith and his unfaithful wife. Not a lot happens but the imagery is fascinating and the characters are interesting and well-cast (I watched an English sub-titled version). Despite the profound philosophical tone of the film (notably the ancient conundrum about God's unwillingness to reveal Himself), there are moments of levity - a man hides up a tree only to see Death standing below with a saw, an actor and the smith exchange a barrage of colourful, scatological insults. Although not to everyone's taste, the film is considered a classic by many and is well worth watching (if only to understand the backstory behind the myriad of pop-references to delaying the ultimate departure by playing games with the Reaper).",

Why can I not perceive him with any of my senses? Yet, why can I not rid myself of the thought of God?

194,17 September 2008,l_rawjalaurence,8, A classic that lasts for all time,"I just saw ""The Seventh Seal"" in its original Swedish without the benefit of subtitles. Although I do not understand the language, I found Bergman's tale of religious skepticism, with undoubted echoes of medieval and Renaissance dramas, morality plays and famous western classics such as ""Dr. Faustus"" absolutely riveting. Bergman was the master of the mise-en-scene; his ability to create cinematic pictures using the minimum of cinematic resources was unrivaled. Unlike today's directors of period dramas, he realized that to recreate an historical period was not simply done by spending thousands of dollars on sets and costumes, but rather depended on the selection of individual props and the telling focus on individual images (for example, the horse standing in the background in several scenes, or the moment involving the flagellants singing the ""Dies Irae""). In terms of cost, the film is low-budget, strongly reminiscent of the B Pictures produced in Britain and the US during the middle part of the twentieth century. In terms of style, however, the film is the work of a genius. I confidently predict it will stand the test of time for another half century to come.",

While watching this film I said that this was not a film that Hitchcock would have wanted to do because it would have broken his suspense guidelines, and that is why I do think that nobody else could have directed this film better than Ingmar Bergman did. One of the directors that I truly admire Woody Allen who did some good films of his own I thought had the perfect choice to select this as one of his all time favorite movies, and the same thing goes with me as well.

Are we alone in the world or not? Is there any hope to feel the God through our life in any way? This film could happen in our age too, because it has the same questions yet we haven't found. Interestingly, no one will forget the face of death in this movie which was played by Bengt Ekerot. The death only carries out his duties but no one knows is there any one to order him to do that? The knight never find out if god is out there or not even when he asked death about it. The death is not able or allowed to answers to the knight whether anything really exists beyond life or not.

As a Swedish person, though admittedly co-bombarded by american/Hollywood ""culture"", I see the tradition in which the test-audience screened Hollywood type movies are the epitome as a special class of movies.

Though Revelations is a favorite Bible book for many rich people, coupling it with a real-life plague that is killing off the poor and wealthy alike might not be the smartest ploy to win the mogul vote. While the Muggles apparently burn a ""witch"" mid-film, the famous chess match between Max Von Snydow's knight and Death is a big let-down. Even the James Bond series has done chess better than this. The ""medieval"" felt costumes look like they've been put together by a home economics flunk-out mom for kindergarten Halloween. Maybe all the philosophizing about God and mortality here is epic in SEAL's original Swedish. If so, it's mostly lost in translation (which is a significant negative, when less than one per cent of movie watchers are fluent in Swedish). Perhaps SEAL can be enjoyed best by turning off the sub-titles, and constructing a story in your head to go along with the occasionally interesting pictures.

225,8 December 2012,daltongray,7, Existentialism in The Seventh Seal,"Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal follows the final days of a knight, and an accompanying band of his squire, actors, and a blacksmith, as he plays chess with Death, his life hanging in the balance. Ominous and foreboding, Bergman steeps The Seventh Seal with existentialist philosophy akin to Sartre's atheist existentialism found in ""Existentialism is a Humanism."" Much of the knight's journey through the film mirrors Sartre's atheistic existentialist notions of anguish, despair, and abandonment. Sartre, unlike others, states that the lack of a God is not simply met with mere acceptance; rather, the person experiences these three feelings. The knight exhibits the anguish, which Sartre suggests is a consequence of one wondering ""What would happen if everyone did what I am doing?,"" early in the film when he ponders ""Through my indifference for people, I've been placed outside of their society."" The abandonment, similarly, is shown through the knight throughout the film. Having realized his inability to find God, the knight requests to meet Satan, who the knight believes ""He if anyone"" must know God, via an alleged witch waiting for execution. Despite the witch's insistence that Satan is all around her and easily seen, the knight, alas, sees nothing. Finally, in the closing moments of the film, as Death presents himself to the knight, the squire, the blacksmith, and their accompanying women, the knight tries one final time to beseech God. However, the squire asserts that ""In that darkness where you reside, where we probably all reside, you'll find no one that listens to your complaint or is moved by your suffering."" In addition to showing the knight's abandonment issue, the squire implies Sartre's final feeling, despair, in that the squire understands that, in the absence of God, man must ""limit"" himself ""to reckoning only with those things that depend of (his) will"" and not that of others.",

The black and white technique fits perfectly with the theme and tone of the film. The theme is great and always current. Life, death, the meaning of life, the existence of God and the devil. I liked every scene with the protagonist Block playing chess against Death, the literal one that isn't really that important (it's more for visuality and aesthetics) as well as that figurative, life duel against Death trying to find out some life secret during games. Chess here represents life, whatever it may be and however great a chess player it may be, Death cannot be defeated. You may be able to extend the game a bit, but in the end Death always sets the checkmate. What bothered me in the film were the numerous supporting actors who removed my emphasis from the ""main"" stories, even though they also participate, each in their own way. I also sometimes get lost in the film from the numerous symbols that seem purposeful to themselves. At the end of the film, I didn't feel like I was watching anything special.",

232,15 October 2002,SinjinSB,9, Ultimately I believe it was never the knight's intention to really try and beat Death,"An excellent Swedish film, directed by Ingmar Bergman. A knight and his squire return from home the crusades to Sweden which is being swept by the plague. He is approached by Death who's come for him and the knight challenges Death to a game of chess to spare his life. Not knowing, I expected this movie to be focused on the game of chess, when it's really more telling the story of how people dealt with the tumultuous times dealing with the black death that is killing off the people. I'm glad this was the case as it is what really drew me into the story. So many interesting elements. Seeing how the religious officials were blaming people for their sins and telling them it was punishment from God. The most telling scene in the movie was when they were talking to the girl who was about burned alive for being involved with the devil. There was one scene that amused me, probably more than intended...when Death was cutting down the tree with a saw. I really enjoyed the lighter scenes that contrasted the serious ones in the movie. Ultimately I believe it was never the knight's intention to really try and beat Death, but to try to prolong life as long as possible in hopes of accomplishing something positive...in this case helping the couple and their child. This is my first Bergman movie, but it makes me anxious to explore more of his work.

The story of a knight that starts to honestly ask questions about the existence of God, while death roams all around him. Literally, Death (the Grimm Reaper) appears and is actually confronting the knight as the instigator, the opponent, and the helper,so they both sit to play chess. The Black plague is all around and the knight has compassion on a family . It's been a long time since I saw this movie but when I did I new I just witnessed something very rare in Cinema. Satan also reviles the concept of God, and in the movie the Devil shows up to say ""He doesn't exist!"" Most of us think the quest for what is in a mans soul as a afterthought but Ingmar Bergman makes the observer ask, ""Where do we go, after we die?"" Do you believe in a cold god, A Satan. If you believe in the devil then you need to think there is a God, the Judeo/Christian Bible Is the first to mention Satan thousands of years ago. So I'd like to think we are looked after by a God.",

The main character comes back to Sweden after fighting in the middle east to restore the birthplace of Christ. He finds his homeland devastated by an incomprehensible dark adversary. The adversary, death decides he won't kill him until he beats him at chess. This movie has an existential quality to it and puts you at odds with knowing most of the people he meets will die, but whom? The movie shows the fears and ignorance of humanity confronted with the unknown and trying to blame it on anything and anyone including themselves.

238,30 May 2007,arthera09,9, artistic masterpiece,"To summarize this movie I would say it is not entertaining at all, but as a piece of art is surpasses most movies I have seen in a while. I would describe watching this movie being similar to going to an art museum and studying original van goghs. Not exciting, but still beautiful none the less. I watched this movie when I was really tired and missed a lot so I decided to watch it again. But because it is really unentertaining it took me a while before I could bring myself to put it in my DVD player. But when I did it was one of the most rewarding movie experiences I have had in a while. The only reason I did not give it a 10 because it was not that entertaining and the scenes with the people whipping themselves lost some of its power (because I have grown up so accustomed to violence in movies). So let's try to start from just the substance of the movie. To even tackle such a hard subject with a movie was extremely bold, but the duologue was so good it almost felt as if I was reading it out of a philosophy book. The desperation of not knowing really pushed this movie forward and it was interesting to see how each of the characters dealt with death and not knowing the end. The fact that death did not know was brilliant and on every level in term of substance it was perfect. There were also some really good shots. The shot where Jon approaches the camera in the empty village was very well done and with live animals very nicely done. Actually one of my favorite shots was a simple one of the Joseph and Mia with the baby and the way the camera above them with Joseph in the front left and Mia in the back right on the tree branch. Not to sound like an ass but the shot felt very organic. I actually loved how he did death here and how he had a sense of humor and loved a challenge making him human. The confidence he exudes was perfect and when he says that he does not know the answer it almost feels as if it is because there is no answer. I like how he used a lot of black in shots of peoples faces. It was really well done and gave that sense of emptiness. My favorite point where that was done is the scene in the church with Death and Block. This is also my favorite scene and I feel as if one of the best scenes I have ever seen. The set up where it feels as if death is in a prison cell to see that Block in indeed the prisoner. The shot of him through the bars where you cannot see the back ground was perfect. I loved all the acting and even it was silly at points (by our standards) it was supposed to be. Even the one guys death scene was meant to be that way. It is interesting that I believe that Joseph and Mia were supposed to die, but Block was able to trick Death, but Death did not know he was tricked. So death can go one thinking he is perfect and has never been beaten. Such a great movie and I could go on and on about it, but I am tired of writing this. Everyone should see this movie and keep in mind that movies can be beautiful pieces of art.",

251,6 May 2020,zeekwunlau,8, Movies like literature,"This film contains very profound philosophical values. Bergman's films were never prepared for audiences without historical experience and background. He defaulted that his audience should adapt to the background of the film. Before we watched the movie, we knew the historical background of the Crusades and the relevant details of the Bible, and we knew the historical background of the black death in the medieval Europe. The saints fixed one on the cross, thinking that she was dealing with the devil to cause this plague. The knight who made a deal with the god of death has been indulging in the pursuit of the truth of God. He longs for the ultimate and the meaning of life, and he gets always nothingness, and reality can hardly satisfy his desire for knowledge. One of Bergman 's scene designs made me feel the originality of this film 's lens language. Several scenes of playing chess with Bleach advanced the strength of the knight and Bleach in the game. At the beginning, Bleach had confidence in the game to outperform the Cavaliers, so the image of Bleach in Bergman's lens is taller than the Cavaliers. After the knight met the actor's family, he seemed to feel the harmony of life and received an unprecedented joy. At this time, his game of death prevailed, so the image of the knight was relatively tall; when the actor's family feared the knight and abandoned him , Grim Reaper won another step on the chessboard, Grim Reaper further up in front of the camera, symbolizing Grim Reaper's further control of the knight's destiny and gaining the upper hand.",

It's a film that raises many questions but gives no answer. You could be the earthy and cynic squire; you could be the noble knight always seeking spiritual meaning in life - in the end, the only certainty will be death. Still, the ending feels strangely reassuring for a Bergman film, as if he was trying to convince himself that death is not to be feared but accepted as one inevitable part of life, that the world will keep going on after our time has come.",

255,16 November 2015,singlespeedcheetah,10," First films were art, then sound was added. Now they are art again.","The film ""The Seventh Seal"", directed by the fantastic Ingmar Burgmann, is a film that is a long and moody rumination on religion and what occurs, if anything, when one no longer adheres to one's religion. Set in medieval Sweden the main protagonist is Antonius Block, a knight returning from the crusades, an ostensibly religiously pursuit. But this is the return trip and fighting shall not be found. Consider the opening scene: a close up of Block with his eyes closed, seemingly asleep at the coast. This is followed by the camera panning right to his squire Jon who is equally prone but making faint stirrings. Form here the camera is pointed towards their horses, albeit, briefly, only to return to Block who now strides to the ocean. It is this blending of reality and the fantastic that occurs repeatedly throughout the film. Consider the following dialog between Block and Death himself—gendered no less: Antonius Block: ""Who are you?"" Death: ""I am Death."" Antonius Block: ""Have you come for me?"" Death: ""I have long walked by your side."" Antonius Block: ""So I have noticed."" Death: ""Are you ready?"" Antonius Block: ""My body is ready, but I am not. "" Never had so much been said with such succinctness. But here in lies the problem with the film: so little is left out that the audience can become lost or disinterested as this is an art film and not subject to the usual film trope of problem and conflict resolution as is often found.

(It was shown in a literature class called ""Romance Through The Ages,"" and yeah, I was one of about two other guys in the whole class... I took it because the Tolkien literature class was full.)  Having been forced to watch it, and fearing it would be pretentious art/crap, I was prepared for the worst and surprised by the very best.  It's allegory readily translates to any era, and it's characters are at once both sympathetic and engaging.  Bergman has Francis Ford Coppola's visual sense, (or vice versa... I've got my cart before my horse here!), and therefore, his movies are very artistic to watch.  (I've often said I could turn off the sound on any given Coppola film and just LOOK at it... same goes for this movie.)  Like most hapless folks of my generation, I was weaned on vapid hollywood tripe, testosterone engorged, brain-dead action and the usual bevy of unattractive splatter films.  Imagine my surprise at realizing that not only could a movie be moving and intelligent, but it could be ART!  What a treat!  This film should be on the ""must see"" list of everyone who has a philosophical bent or who has ever questioned the current ""conventional wisdom"" about life, death and meaning.  Thanks to this film, I've discovered other classic cinema greats like Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welle's, Stanley Kubrick... the list goes on and on.  Movies are fine, but give your eyes and your brain something of substance and treat yourself to some real cinema every now and again.

The movie is set during the plague of XIV century and the whole atmosphere is dark and oppressive and leads to a general sense of fear and uncertainty in the people of the time. In this setting everyone has to confront death, both as an idea and as a person. ""The Seventh Seal"" shows a variety of characters that have different faith as far as religion, life and death. There is the one who has a strong faith and thanks to this is able to be less anxious, there is an artist who has a special sensitivity about life and love, there is an atheist who is the most rational and the one who lives more freely than the others and there's the knight who fought in the crusade and at the time in which he has to confront his possible death loses all of his beliefs to became obsessed with the sense of life and what religion is. And his struggles are amplified by the fact that the Church at that time was corrupted and wasn't a real guidance for the believer's souls. The great thing about ""The Seventh Seal"" is that the answers are not definitive because life does not provide them.

So the knight sees death all around him and takes into a journey with his squire Jöns to get answers about God and life. He comes across some people like circus group and finds out how they are dealing with death and life, and witch all of them helping him in some way in his quest.

As they approach home, Death, chillingly played with conviction by Bengt Ekerot in a scene-stealing performance, appears to them in human form as a hooded, black cloaked pale man with a piercing glance. Block challenges the omnipotent Death to a games of Chess, which he excepts, where If Block wins, he can live. Block will try to cheat Death, but at the end it will Death who cheats him.

287,9 April 2006,Dyssonant,10, Maybe the greatest film ever,"An great, desperate yet unresigned, anthem to human condition. Many scenes are very, very powerful. The stunning opening with the appearance of Death is one the most impressive ever seen on the screens. The confession sequence is so simple and deep and moving: you feel the essence of your entire, small, brief life vanishing with Blok's words. The arrival of the flagellating pilgrims in the village is visually astonishing, like the unforgettable ending scene with the ""danse macabre"". Cinematography and acting are outstanding, and the transfigured Middle Age renders an angst sensation during all the film. Characters are very well assorted and the film has aged very well.",

It is up to the viewer himself to make up their own minds to what that is. Personally i believe in the very thing Max von Sydows character is afraid of, ""nothingness"". But as far as the film is concerned isn't death appearing as a person proof of the afterlife? It is not just a bleak film since it has some genuine humor in it. For one i thought the blacksmith was utterly amusing in his acts and dialog. In fact all the characters was amusing in a sense in their own way. So far this is the best Bergman film i have seen. But i have only seen between 5-7 titles thus far.",

291,10 January 2006,luzgannon,10, It Is Finished!,"OUTLINE. It is the year the Great Plague hits Scandinavia. A seasoned knight, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) returns from some ten year's long late crusading venture to the Holy Land, to which he went out a Believer, where he became a Denier, and whence he now comes back a Seeker. He is followed by his loyal squire, the coarsely cynical, still brave and righteous Jöns (Gunnar Björnstand), with whom he keeps a strong bond and an implicit debate going on. During the journey, he encounters various people and events, all with a particular bearing on the Knight's all consuming Quest for God's Existence and the Meaning of Life; first of all he meets Death himself (Bengt Ekerot), but he contrives to postpone his end by challenging by his sinister opponent to a game of chess, which he intends to win, though he really can't, as he himself in the final analysis knows. Then, we see, among others, the naïvely charming family of entertainers, Jof (Nils Poppe), his loving pretty wife Mia (Bibi Andersson) and the infant Mikael, later we see the unrepenting Witch on her way to the stakes (Maud Hansson), the primitive blacksmith Plog (Åke Fridell) and his trampy wife (Inga Gill), the silent peasant girl (Gunnel Lindblom). Many join him to a following on the route. Finally they reach his home castle where his noble and faithful wife Karin (Inga Landgré) courteously receives them all. He has by now lost his game; and the same night Death comes to claim his harvest, and in the culminating scene they all confront Death with a display of their respective true personal nature. Then follows a short epilogue, where the juggler family, having escaped Death, moves away in a state of happy innocence.",
292,27 January 2008,ShiiStyle,9, Disagreed with philosophy but deserves no less than 9/10,"The Seventh Seal tackles death in a fashion which must have seemed horridly confrontational at the time but now seems too specifically Christian to me. The prince is gripped with existential angst about being unsure if he can meet God or Satan. In the world of the film, neither is there to comfort him; Death is the only sure thing. To some this may seem like a cause for despair, but to me it smacked of forcing the universe into small-minded Western forms. God, Satan, and Death are all names we have ascribed to the general metaphysical mish-mash; even the corpse they meet at the beginning of the movie is only ""dead"" insofar as it is clear from context that it was once a living being but is no more. When it becomes a fertilizer for the grass it will hardly be dead anymore. The judgments we make and feelings we attribute to these things are our own invention. If the prince were Buddhist he'd be handling this subject from quite a different approach.",

It's filled with a number of memorable and impactful scenes, as the indifferent character of Death overhangs the knight's return, and yet it's all colored with a sort of tongue in cheek humor that saves the experience from being cold and bleak. An interesting and engaging movie from start to finish.",
296,1 April 2009,Miura88,8," Perfect movie, and the perfect starting point for Bergman","This was the first film I watched by Ingmar Bergman, and in my eyes it's one of his very best. Ingmar loved to ask whether God exists or not, and while he may have devised more subtle ways to ask that question in later films, his directness in ""The Seventh Seal"" is one of the film's strong points. Antonius Block returns from fighting in the Crusades (Max Von Sydow) when he gets a visit from The Grim Reaper himself (Bengt Ekerot). But Antonious is not ready to die, and in order to buy himself some time, he challenges Death to a game of Chess. The Black Death has also taken hold of Antonius' hometown, and the villagers have been plunged into fear of the plague (The Black Death and the Crusades did not occur at the same time in real life, and this film is not meant to be historically accurate) The game of Chess continues throughout the film, and it even manifests itself through other characters in the film (one of the very first corpses found in the film could very well be an early pawn taken during the game of Chess). As Antonius travels through a village, along with his Squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand, who steals almost every scene he's in), he meets a variety of people, the most important two people are Jof and Mia, a couple of travelling artists very much in love, who also have a young son. Sven Nykvist may not have done the cinematography, but this is still one of the best looking films you could ever see. The dark and moody atmosphere is brilliantly reflected in the dark clouds, sinister forests and wonderful use of smoke throughout the movie. The soundtrack really adds to the mood, and the acting is nothing short of excellent. ""The Seventh Seal"" is only 90 minutes long, and Ingmar Bergman manages to say more in this film than some directors can say in over twice the running time: The existence of God, man's mortality in limited time, the damaging effects of war on a man's faith and an artist's importance to humanity. ""The Seventh Seal"" is a dark, thought-provoking movie on the human condition. Not only is it classic Bergman, it is classic cinema.",
297,23 August 2015,samicebergjohnson,10, A true Master piece of classical cinema,"For its time, Ingmar Bergman's iconic ""The Seventh Seal"" was revolutionary for its blatancy in showing the absence of God but the presence of Death. Much of what comprises this film; is not what those who know of it would attribute to it, visually speaking. Most people can only think about the visual of a knight on a beach, just back from the Crusades, the ocean suddenly silenced when a dark figure reveals himself on the horizon. It is Death, cloaked all in black, his white washed face standing out against the backdrop of pure nature. They play a game of chess for the knight's life, and so the film begins. Past that most people don't know much about this film. For one thing, there is very little chess featured in this film. For another, the knight has a comrade who he travels with. They go through the countryside, where the Plague has laid siege to all peoples. Everyone has become mad and frightened at the prospect of death, and belies religion's influence for some help in the matter of their mortality. A large amount of people believe in the religious fervor that is sweeping the countryside, and lend themselves to self-abuse, crucifixions, and murder. Others try to steal from the dead and help themselves through the devastation of the illness. Everyone seems to be trying to find answers to why there is war, poverty, and illness when God is supposed to protect them from their woes. A girl is captured and confesses to consorting with the Devil, which she says brought about the plague. She is only an innocent, content in turning from her God because of his absence, but not really a conspirer with evil. The film encourages exploration and takes a step back from theology by showing the very evils it inflicted in the past. Still, there is a call for people to also keep their faith in the face of Death, even while he's playing chess across from you. There's also a young couple who are very friendly and giving, and their fates are sealed thanks to their faith and love for one another. Bergman may not have known the infinitesimal questions that come from exploring your own doubt and frustrations with life. Though Bergman continually questioned himself in his later films, there is never an answer, only the freedom to question at all.",

The film opens with a brilliant shot of the bleak sky, accompanied by appropriately despairing choral music. The iconography gets better from there.

All the actors are perfectly clean with (especially the women) lots of makeup, flawless faces and teeth, perfectly coiffed hair, plucked eyebrows (only the women); the clothing includes 20th-century halter tops.

The portrayal of death as a tired old man is wonderfully original, the film is beautifully shot and contains some wonderful flashes of humour as well as some extremely poignant moments (such as when the knight claims that, if God does not exist, ""then life is an outrage, an unspeakable outrage"").

Although not perfect, this work succeeds on multiple levels; I found the actors and their characters engaging, the cinematography stunning, the plot, the imagery, and the messages therein worthy of deep consideration.  In sum, Bergman gives us a grand treatment of medieval life and existential philosophy.  In the hands of a lesser director, the imagery could easily have degenerated into something overplayed and hokey.  Instead, we have a subtle movie for the ages.",

Wherever I would go I couldn't escape this movie.  After reading the comments on this site I decided that I would finally see what this movie is all about.  After a long struggle I managed to get my hands on a copy of the excellent DVD.  I started by watching the film with the dubbing on.  Five minutes into the film I got frustrated and put the original Swedish back on and restarted the movie.  After the movie was over I couldn't stop thinking about this movie. Its theme and idea paralleled a struggle in my own life.  I love this movie. It is not just another flavor of the week I am praising.  It has already joined my top 10.  It is so good that I have managed to convince my girlfriend to watch it.  She has no taste in movies and this isn't even the kind of movie she would have ever dreamed about watching during any point in her life.  Maybe this movie will move her like it did for me and open up the door for her to have a better understanding of the world around her.,
305,21 February 2023,shinrisen,7, Slow but interesting film,"I've never seen an Ingmar Bergman film before, but I know he has a reputation for making slow movies. 'The Seventh Seal' is a slow movie, but it manages to be quite interesting due to a wonderful mix of imagined/symbolic imagery mixed with the 'mundane' reality. It doesn't need to use a lot of special effects or anything to achieve this, which I think is something that more movies should do.",
306,4 November 2006,rk176,10, Man's existential agony,"I love this film. In my opinion it aims at and successfully displays not only man's fear of death, even when some of the characters believe in an afterlife, but more importantly, man's various emotional and intellectual strong reactions of living life with the great uncertainty of what happens after death, and what's more, the meaning of existence and suffering if there is no God. The sensual squire seems to take the question of life (and death) with an atheistic calmness, while others, particularly the knight, agonize over the absolute senselessness of life if there is not God. It must be remembered that the film takes place in the 14th century during the murderous intensity of the brutal Black Plague, which heightens the question of the meaningfulness or pointlessness of life at all. I think all thinking people, including but certainly not exclusive to Sartre and Camus would enjoy this film. Is life and suffering of any value in what might be a pointless and absurd world. ""To be or not to be"" is really the underlying question here and, just like Hamlet, neither answer is satisfactory.",

Hardly left any impression on me at that time, but I accounted the failure to my philistine taste and undeveloped maturity. Years later, I watched Persona and it made complete sense to me on a deep level. But again, I may have overcompensated for my earlier guilt. But I really liked the existential musings and the abstract images open to interpretation in Persona. Rather than creating characters and illuminating juicy ideas through their lives, one abstracts juicy ideas first and then plays them on an intellectual chessboard through cipher characters. So hip are the symbols and the abstractions, that the game looked great in cocktail discussions and pickup lines. But a beating heart was always missing.",

Very often I'll find my admiration for a thematically substantive film tempered by my frustration at how mercilessly the themes are propounded. What impresses me the most about The Seventh Seal is that Bergman's startlingly bold symbolic choices don't result in this kind of excess. We see Death himself - playing chess with a doomed mortal, no less - and yet we (or I, at least) don't at all feel that Bergman has gone too far. The dialogue, even when it deals with such weighty topics as the existence of God, seems honest and natural. (The possible exception is Antonius's musing on how meaningful is his experience with Jof, Mia, and the bowl of strawberries.) Max von Sydow is perfect. He and Ekerot's performance in the confession scene magnificently complements Bergman's masterful dialogue and cinematography. The Seventh Seal unquestionably deserves its status as a masterpiece.",

If you are keenly interested in watching different arts and folklores, you should definitely go for his film ""The Seventh Seal"" . The movie follows a medieval knight Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) challenging Death (Bengt Ekerot), who has come to take his life, to a match of chess in the hope that he can survive longer. The plot is set in Sweden during the catastrophic period of the Black Death in the medieval times. I was astounded to see how finely Bergman carved the image of terror and horror into the personified image of Death. The concepts of faith, belief, evil and good are discussed in the movie alongside fright and dismay characteristic to the medieval times.

To its eternal discredit, its virulent take on a plethora of points has been proven prophetic, with the virus of insanity that has spread well beyond the faculty lounges at the time of its release.

Like other films of Bergman that I have seen, this again is a reflection on death and its relevance to life. Taking the context of plague-ridden medieval Europe Bergman discusses various aspects of human existence - religion, happiness, faith, god - against the backdrop of omniscient death. There's really no point in trying to give you the plot summary and stuff like that because this is not about story or characters or drama, it's essentially an illustrative discussion of Bergman's existentialist philosophies and has to be actually seen and absorbed in toto to",

I highly reccomend this film to anyone and everyone.",
320,10 December 2012,mbriana,9, existentialism,"The events and themes of Ingar Bergman's classic The Seventh Seal show numerous examples of existentialism. Throughout the film, characters blame occurrences such as the black plague on God, helplessly resorting to the idea that they have no individual control over their destinies. Protagonist Antonius Block, however, constantly tries to challenge this belief as he plays a game of chess with Death, his life dependent upon the outcome. He tells Death that he is searching for meaning in life and is frustrated with trying to believe in religion and in a God who ""hides in a mist of vague promises and unseen miracles."" The silence of God is also a recurring theme, as the characters seem to be ever searching for ways to please God yet ever lacking in His rewards. Antonius and others continuously question the existence of God, but, unlike the others, Antonius strives to achieve the existentialist concept of governing one's own future and making one's own choices—as is evident by his request to gamble his life on a game of chess with Death, rather than passively and nonchalantly accepting Death's arrival.",

322,24 November 2000,gandhi35,10, Metaphorically epic,"Bergman's 1957 masterpiece, The Seventh Seal, is my second favorite film next to Citizen Kane.  WOW!  When I first saw the piece, I was amazed about how much one filmmaker could make his screenplay and his direction work like sex.  The screenplay is dark, I mean, it only as a character called Death in it (literally, Death is death), and it displays the isolation of the Middle Ages just like Larry McMurtry's book, The Last Picture Show, describes the isolation of the 50's.  So, how does the direction work?  Well, it shows us how human beings cope with death.  All the fears and all the hopes of death are dealt with through this fascinating work of genius. Now, don't use the comparison to McMurtry's book to an extreme.  I mean, with the circus performers and musicians in this film, the characters are alot more cultural than the awfully horny teens in The Last Picture Show. The isolation is within.  Take Jons, the knight, for example.  He's trying to escape his own death, which is like escaping humanity.  Sonny, from McMurtry's novel, is also trying to escape his life, which goes hand in hand with death.  That's where the real epic is in this film, the coping with life and death.  A character study at its finest. The direction is dynamic.  There's a whole lot of still shots, but then there's a few scenes that are like a 50's style of the D-Day sequence in Saving Private Ryan.  There's also alot of Hitchcockian zooms and pans and close-ups, especially the scene when Death confronts everyone in Jons' castle.  Amazing stuff. This is the second greatest movie that I've ever seen and easily one of the most profound.  I can't wait to see other works my Ingmar Bergman (especially Fannie and Alexander).",

The Seventh Seal is about Bergman's inner personal questions and thoughts that he was wondering about during his lifetime. We see as his perspective through the movie seeking for a meaning for everything that been told to us since we were too young to question them. It's not attend to be critical at anything at all, Just the things that a kid or a simple human being would ask to himself about all the meaning and beyond and death subjects. Would it be challenging? Definitely. But who else could have done it in a better way. Characters are so symbolic and all each represent to a form of human way of thinking and perspective. From a knight crusade to a circus clown they got much different ways of seeing and understand things from whatsoever happen around them to the all philosophical questions in life that would cross our minds. But Bergman is the director that could fit them so perfectly in a frame all together that not only it's so meaningful but still enjoyable to watch every minute of it. you can still watch the movie and enjoy it even if you don't seek a meaning or never questioned things or simply you don't care about these stuff. The plot narrate during medieval period that religions were reigning not only the lands but to more efficiently the thoughts and minds.

can be viewed many times.
one of the best movies ever.",
333,7 February 2022,Matukaz17,8, Another man's man,"Jöns the squire is a subject who has survived the crusade, from which he could return mentally affected, sad or worried, as if regretting what he has lived through, but he seems indifferent to many things; indifferent to the suffering of others and indifferent to many of the customs or situations of others. He is a tough guy, his scars and his face usually presented in a serious way tell it. He makes fun of other people's problems and belittles the feelings of others. It is not clear what Jöns's personal motives are, he only takes an interest in the common pleasures of life, such as women and drink. Even when he had death in front of him he remained serene. It seems that the war has forged it that way, but I think it is a cynicism that was already innate in the person, at least in a crude form.",
334,2 June 2000,devoux79,10, The Greatest Film Ever Made!,"Bergman so skillfully shows the inner workings of man in his most difficult struggle.  He was able to take a very dark and turbulent time and show confusion and obliviousness, fear and tumult in an amazing way and without bias.  He combined an amazingly dark story with astounding cinematography to create the greatest film that I have ever seen.",
335,18 April 2001,theincrediblekelvo,10, One of the Greatest Movies Ever Made!,"This movie deals with more than just entertainment it deals with something that has haunted people forever, their own mortality. I would recommend this movie to everyone. Ingmar Bergman is an artistic mastermind, and this is his masterpiece.",
336,25 October 2000,raul2010,9, Bergman mixes up but does not err,"This movie shows the society of the Middle Ages in a very exact way. However, I must say that there's a completely forgivably inaccuracy. Bergman mixed up two different centuries: the 11th and the 14th. The 11th century was the time of the Crusades impelled by Urban I; so the knight that comes back from the Crusades can only be placed in the 11th. And the 14th was the century of the plagues in Europe, the plagues that scares so much everybody in the story. Obviously, this is not a mistake; creators can adapt some parts of history because they have a superior artistic mission.",
337,28 June 2001,conny bloom,10, The most important Bergman,"If you are to see one Bergman movie in your life, make sure it´ll be The Seventh Seal. The opening is purely magic with the arrival of Death, and the mood set in this scene is contagious for the rest of the film. von Sydow is great as the knight and Nils Poppe is acting huge as the skillful juggler. To sum up, The Seventh Seal has it all, action, love, death, betrayal, thrill, humor. A must!",
338,13 October 2019,alinebrayner,9, A master piece!!,In my opinion the best of all Bergman's movies. Dramatic and with a refined humor in complex aspects of life.,
339,26 April 2023,gibrilbenel,10, A Beautiful Celebration of Life,"When the characters seem to say, « Pity the living », it feels like Bergman wants to say, « Don't pity anyone; live, laugh, and smile; and when Death comes at you, embrace and follow. »
When Antonius is looking for a meaning in life or in death, he doesn't realize until the last 20 minutes that what he is looking for is right in front of his eyes. It's death that gives meaning to life. Death allows us to live until we don't anymore. Death allows us to feel, cherish, and live life to the fullest.",
340,25 November 2006,orlowtraber,10, great movie,"This Film is amazing. everyone who want to know what our world is made of and who wants to know what the knights of the holy cross where like, all this people have to watch this movie.It is such a great movie. It does not count if it seems real or unreal, it is such fun to watch it, because every actor does everything he can to make a movie which stands upon time and criticism. I wish that more movies like this would be made in our time , but i think that movies like this are going to die in our world of action and ......... Just watch it. Everything is great about it, and I do not just say that because, just like everx other one who votes for a movie on this site says that it is great, I really think that this movie can change lives, and turn them into something that makes sense.",
341,15 June 2014,nima_azad78,9, Looking for salvation,It is a wonderful film. A knight's returns home from war. The most important aspect of his life seems to remain unanswered. He searched for truth .He hasn't found it yet and it's getting clear through the film it's not going to happen.,
342,9 September 2005,ikaros_damtralla,6, Well.... its OK.. Quite unique and deep. It has a meaning somewhere if you look really hard....,"Ingmar Bergman is HIGHLY overrated!!! Sure it has its highlights. Like when Death kills the actor in the tree by sawing it down... Yea... why kill them in the end!? Only Ingmar knows that one. Maybe! In his movies you can watch a woman stand and stare into the camera for one minute!! THATS A BOOK!!!! He make the plot out of the characters thoughts... that is not right for a movie. I have to watch his movies at least 5 times to make sense out of the thinking, metaphorical mess.. He think his stories are 10 times more interesting than they are. And i certainly don't get the quote: ""Are you ready?"" ""My body is frighten. Not I"" THAT WAS NOT THE QUESTION YOU .... (Dont know what it is in the English version so i translated it myself..) It says a lot about Bergman himself, though. And thats interesting. He admitted that he made this movie to help with his death-thoughts.",
343,13 September 2016,rrbgoku,7, thought provoking and intriguing with darkly humour,the movie strangely has attractive cinematography--- especially strange for a 50+ year old movie.,
344,14 February 2022,dmitryfridman,9, makes you think,Thought provoking - prove of existence of god via conversing with devil; playing chess with death and giving away your master plan - but why does death need to cheat; many characters each with a story. Fascinating and deep movie.,
345,27 February 2006,mercury-44,10, A must see.,"Quintessential 1950's metaphysics and introspection of the rapidly rising director Ingmar Bergman, the ""The Seventh Seal"" assaults the senses with fine black and white cinematography; horrors of a plague infested Europe...plunges into questions of God and the meaning of life--familiar themes that to this very day find relevance in many global reels of celluloid. This, and a cluster of films from this era mark one phase of Bergman's inquiries...and probably his best. The film is worth several screenings especially when viewed at a theater. The horror of the young girl suffering false accusations of being with the Devil and consumed by the purging flames is etched in the mind. All the usual iconic symbols are here: Faithfulness, curiosity, innocence, revenge, ignorance, and greed. A must see.",
346,19 March 2023,mixmage-,10, Is Fight Club a reference to The Seventh Seal?,"Kind of tangential, but I've never discussed this with anyone, or heard/read anyone say/write this...",
347,21 April 2019,viskov-90367,9, Great Pictures!,Ingmar Bergman is master! Almost every aspect of the film was perfect! My favorite one was the cinematography! Beautiful! I have bit of a problem with the characters but not distracting at all. Overall a great experience and a prime example what a film should be!,
348,14 September 2019,rajabhishek-11529,10, nice,"This series has lost its way. It's way too focused on the relationship between Alex and Piper (a real snooze fest) and not focused enough on what makes these characters interesting. There is no spark here anymore. What made seasons 1 and 2 interesting just isn't there anymore. This story is played out. Time for it to go! And Pennsatucky! Really? Do new teeth completely transform a person? I think not. By far the most interesting character on the show, Red, has been reduced to a total stereotype - of the aging tough woman with a heart of gold. She was so interesting before and now she is just as boring as all of the other characters. Most boring of all is Alex. She was edgy in seasons 1 and 2 and now she is just annoying - not interesting at all. Did they change writers or producers or did they just have one good idea and they are stringing it out as long as possible? I will say that Crazy Eyes continues to be the most fun character to watch - played to perfection!",
349,25 February 2012,mc-manjunath,8," Interesting, thought provoking!","Movie is different, which is not bounded by time. Man's hunger for knowledge or even to fight the death is handled well by Ingmar...",
