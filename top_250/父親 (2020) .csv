0,13 April 2021,classicsoncall,9," ""I don't know what's happening anymore.""","This movie brings you inside the mind of someone losing their memories and recognition of those around them. In another genre, what happens here could just as well take place in a horror film. The fascinating thing about the story as it unfolds is that as the viewer, there comes a point where you begin to question whether what you're seeing is what the principal character is experiencing, or whether it's a figment of Anthony's (Anthony Hopkins) imagination. The distinction between his reality and the reveries that make up his daily existence sort of blend together in a way that confound the senses. Hopkins is extraordinary in the role, and if this is his last chance to earn an Oscar for Best Actor, then it's a darn good one in a field with some significant competition. Olivia Colman as Anthony's struggling daughter expresses all the concern and frustration that comes with being the primary caregiver for her dementia stricken father, and there are somber moments in the picture when you want to cry along with her over the hopelessness of both his and her situation. As a harbinger of what might happen to anyone as we all approach those senior twilight years, the film can be a depressing experience, only somewhat mitigated by the care and concern that dedicated health care workers are able to provide in an institutional setting. As tender and comforting as the closing scene is, it's one that will break the heart of anyone who's been through a similar experience.",/

3,4 April 2021,MOscarbradley,10, Hopkins has never been better.,"I haven't seen the play on which ""The Father"" is based, (or indeed the other two plays in Florian Zeller's trilogy on the family), but as cinematic adaptations go this is as good as it gets. Taking place almost entirely on a single set, this is an actor's piece of the highest order and its linchpin is a magnificent performance from Anthony Hopkins as ""The Father"" of the title, a man suffering from advanced dementia and perhaps, both in Hopkins's performance and Zeller's treatment of the subject, this will come to be seen as the definitive film on dementia as anyone with personal experience can testify.",v

5,26 August 2021,deloudelouvain,8, Most realistic movie about dementia.,"The Father couldn't be more realistic when talking about Alzheimer's disease. I've seen my grandfather walking that path. He was a smart man but once the dementia kicked in he was barely recognizable, which was a hard thing to witness when you knew him as the intellectual he was. The Father just nailed this subject, bringing back so many memories, memories we would rather forget but that you can't. Living with a loved one with this disease isn't easy at all, certainly not when that person sometimes doesn't remember who you are. I didn't knew Anthony Hopkins won an Oscar for his role, but after watching this movie I can only say it's highly deserved. It's probably one of his better performances ever, and that at 83 years old. The Father isn't a movie that will give you a lot of joy, it's sad and scary but certainly worth watching. Nobody wants to have a loved one suffering from dementia, it's a nightmare to live with. I remember my grandfather starting to smoke a cigarette like it was a thing he always did and that whilst he stopped more than forty years ago. I remember him telling me he was going crazy after asking me the same question for the twentieth time in barely an hour. He knew it was all going downhill, he knew he was a burden to everybody, and that must hurt when you are still that little bit lucid to understand that. I watched several movies about dementia but this one is just the most realistic. It's sad but that's life, everybody should watch it so they can be prepared if the disease ever would hit a loved one.",e

7,22 May 2021,Cineanalyst,8, Demented Puzzle,"Dementia is a terrible disease. It's not something I'm interested in seeing depicted on screen. I've already seen enough of that. ""Amour"" (2012), with it likewise being claustrophobically isolated to an apartment and although it involves a stroke, especially comes to mind. Anticipating it was a depressingly realistic slice-of-life drama, I wasn't enthusiastic about seeing this Awards-winner, ""The Father,"" from a playwright turned first-time movie director. Fortunately and surprisingly, I don't think it's that, and one would be well advised to see it before reading reviews for it, including this one. I'm not familiar with the writer-director's original play that this is an Anglicization of, ""Le PÃ¨re,"" nor the French film already made of it, ""Floride"" (2015), so I don't know how much of it was always of design or if anything is original here. I mean, ""they don't even speak English there."" Regardless, that ""The Father"" may come across as what I feared it was--and what others seem to discuss it as--is because we may forget genres when introduced to their entries in unpredictable ways. But, remember, ""The Father"" is a mind-game film, a puzzle picture.",/

It shows the kind of situation that may concern millions of us, now or in the future, or also in the past, about one of our relatives. Of course Anthony Hopkins gives a more than brilliant performance and the most unusual is to lead the audience in some kind of a maze, the audience who can have the feeling to be tricked. Anyway, I warn some audiences against this beautiful and powerful stage movie, some audiences who could have a father or mother suffering of Alzheimer disease. It could be very painful to watch.

Not only does it give you the perspective of a mind that has devolved into dementia, it creatively immerses you in their moment-to-moment thoughts and experiences through the repeating confusing scenes, changing context, strange faces, disappearing furniture, etc. Now who could convincingly portray an old man who has lost his mind through an acting performance that showcases the opposite of dementia? None other than Sir Anthony Hopkins! Here, we have this veteran actor at 82 years old who could very well be a victim of dementia himself at that ripe old age. Instead, he is firing at all cylinders, giving us this heartwarming performance of a lifetime making us convinced that he really has dementia, but the act of doing so just proves he is at the top of his game with elite-level acting. Who would've thought that after 30 years of his legendary Hannibal Lecter, he would top himself with this one? I look forward to more Anthony Hopkins films to come!",1

Chadwick would have deserved an Oscar for his performance in the ""Get up"" movie (his James Brown personification was ... just awesome and spot on), but everyone who was against the decision, must not have seen the Father.

Dementia and Alzheimer's disease are frequent topics in movies these days for the simple reason that so many are impacted either directly or through a friend or family member. The importance of memory to our core being cannot be over-stated. It's crucial to who we are and what we feel. The first feature film from French director Florian Zeller is an excellent and poignant tale, all too real for those who have experienced this with a loved one. Zeller adapted his own play (winning a Tony Award for Frank Langella) with his co-writer, Oscar winner Christopher Hampton (DANGEROUS LIASONS, 1988).

The dizzying disorientation of losing one's grip on basic reality, the loss of dignity, and the vulnerability associated having dementia are portrayed here in a stunning way, with the film giving us enough of the perspective of an old man to truly feel his horror. At the same time it allows us to follow what's really going on, with one of his daughter's struggling to get proper care for him and dealing with her own emotions as well. In a cruel twist of fate, she was never his favorite daughter but ended up being his caregiver, and he no longer possesses the tact to stop talking about her sister.

38,20 March 2021,historiafilms,9, Sometimes You Forget How Great an Actor Is ...,"And then you get Anthony Hopkins in THE FATHER. This is a devastatingly, heartbreakingly-brilliant performance and a great film. Hopkins' range is incredible. He goes from charming and funny to menacing to wholly lost in seconds. From man to child on a dime. It's a powerful rumination on a terrifying disease, bolstered by Sir Tony at his finest, a strong supporting turn from Olivia Colman, and an excellent script by Christopher Hampton and Florian Zeller (based on Zeller's play). It's a daring move to tell the story from the perspective of Hopkins' character as his mind increasingly deteriorates. A savvy one too, as the audience is forced to engage to truly understand what is real, who is who, and where precisely we are in our protagonist's gut-wrenching journey. This may be Hopkins best work, a late-career revelation that once again reminds us why he's one of our finest cinematic performers. Be warned.

40,30 September 2020,TrueWouve,9, And the Oscar goes to...,"I had the wonderful opportunity to see The Father at CIFF this year. I went in excited to see what Sir Anthony Hopkins would do with a study on dementia. As I consider Sir Anthony as arguable the best actor in film these days I had pretty high expectations. And I was not at all let down. When his character, also named Anthony, become confused or curmudgeonly you recognize some of his other great performances. But in fact I was most impressed at how warm and charming of a character Sir Anthony could also play. He was just simply spell binding when his character was his ""old self"". With all this being said perhaps the most remarkable performance of the film comes from Olivia Colman who plays Anthony's daughter, Anne. The patience, frustration, hurt and unwavering love depicted while Anne tries to find the best way to care for her father is truly remarkable. I'm sure there will be Oscar buzz for both of these performances and for the adapted screen play of Director Florian Zeller.",

It's hard to grasp on what's going on, but that's the point as that's how it connects you with the character. Anthony Hopkins also gave an incredible performance which attaches the viewer to this struggling old man. He made me feel all the emotions of his character, it's simply beautiful. It really deserves acclaim for being so original in its approach to storytelling by making the audience feel like they're experiencing the characters life rather than just observing it.",

43,11 April 2021,moonspinner55,7, Another tour-de-force from Hopkins,"The devastating effects of Alzheimer's disease (although never mentioned by name) on an aged ex-engineer in London. There is no conventional story in ""The Father"", and that's as it should be. Director Florian Zeller, who also co-adapted his 2012 play ""Le PÃ¨re"" with Christopher Hampton, gets inside the deteriorating mind of the central character with astonishing skill (although it takes about 15 minutes to get into the movie's rhythm). Anthony Hopkins gives an incredible performance; his confused, frustrated Anthony is delusional, forgetful, obsessed with time, unable to distinguish the past from the present, and prone to nostalgic bewilderment and angry fits of befuddlement. We, too, are lost in time as people Anthony is introduced to are either figments of his imagination or are substitutes for whomever is trying to communicate with him in the present. It's a moving journey through a trap-door existence, though the operatic pieces by composer Ludovico Einaudi are a tiny bit excruciating (less so if you admire the genre) and Zeller tends to overdose on weary-eyed closeups of Olivia Colman playing Anthony's conflicted daughter. Six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Hopkins as Best Actor. *** from ****",

Anthony(the great and super Anthony Hopkins) is an old man living in London, who's caretaker has left and his grown daughter Anne(Olivia Colman) now has and wants to take care of him in his final years, however this will prove a tough task with his current emotional and mental state as the dementia is clearly draining and sadly taking it's toll. The scenes are well acted as the state of mind seems real, however it's painful and numbing watching the decline of Anthony every day with doubt as his mind is always changing people and places for him.

The film places the viewer in the mind of a man losing his memory as Hopkins delivers an acting masterclasses with his portrayal with this character. See the world, with gaps and misplaced memories, as the elderly man tries to keep his world in order. Most films that focus on memory loss take the sorrowful perspective of loved ones or from an angle looking over the shoulder of the protagonist rather than through their mind as their mind plays tricks on them. This film is outstanding from the atmosphere it creates, purposeful pacing, exacting cinematography and spot on acting. Hopkins character arc is also...well...plain sad.

Sir Tony is just incredible in this one. His character is loveable, relatable and has that charm that, in spite of dementia, still shines through him. As the title says, he plays the father of adorable and caring Olivia Coldman which is in mine book, after seeing her astonishing performance, one of the best actresses in the world of cinema right now. She is soo good in emitting emotions to the screen that she could do that with her mimicking alone, no words needed. Seeing sorrow in her eyes while looking after the man who raised her is just hard to watch. But the preformanse at the end of the film given by the veteran of cinema sir Antony Hopkins is just OUT OF THIS WORLD. I never felt that way while watching a movie. It was like a giant stone was pressed on my chest and i started sobbing like a child, first time after untimely death of my father 10 years ago. Thanks God I watched the movie alone.

56,29 July 2022,kellielulu,6, A bit underwhelmed,This movie was so hyped that by the time I watched last year I thought I would be watching the best thing ever filmed. Minus the hype and Oscar dynamics I would have watched it but not thought much about it afterwards except it had two of our most acclaimed and skilled actors in it . Hopkins and Colman are good but I didn't see anything I haven't seen before with them. Yes it devastating to endure this dreadful disease. I probably took something else away from it how the least favored child is left to care for the critical parent a common occurrence . Hopkins however didn't do anything I haven't watched from him before it's just used differently here due to the characters mental decline. It's a Hopkins standard blustery and harsh then vulnerable and needy . Watch Howard's End or Remains of the Day it's similar in it's way. .To see a different element of his talent we have Hannibal Lecter so he definitely has range as an actor. I don't mean to sound overly critical it's less that than not feeling the hype equaled the actual experience of watching it .,

63,19 April 2021,jboothmillard,9, The Father,"With cinemas being closed during the COVID-19 lockdown, it was difficult know when I'd be able to watch this on the big screen, so I'm thankful when it went online, with it being nominated during Awards Season, I was most keen to watch it, based on the acclaimed play by Florian Zeller, who debuts as writer and director. Basically, Anne (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Olivia Colman) visits her father Anthony (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Anthony Hopkins) in his flat after he becomes aggressive towards his recent caretaker. Anthony has developing dementia and constantly forgets important life events and where things are in his flat, including his watch, even though he places it in the same place every day. He tells Anne he thinks his recent caretaker stole his watch and that he will never leave his flat. Anne tells Anthony she plans to leave London and move to Paris to live with her new boyfriend. Anthony is confused and thinks she is still married to James, but she tells him that they have been divorced for five years and leaves. The next day, Anthony sees a man he does not recognise named Paul (Mark Gatiss) and is confused that he is living with him in his flat. Paul states that Anthony lives with him and Anne. Anthony is confused when Anne returns from the shops with chicken for dinner and appears as a different woman (Olivia Williams). His confusion causes him to become frustrated. Anne schedules an interview for a new caretaker in his house. Laura (Imogen Poots) meets with Anthony for the position. During their meeting Anthony claims he was a professional dancer and that he doesn't need any living assistance. After Laura has been hired, Anthony states that she reminds him of his other daughter Lucy. He mentions that he has not talked to Lucy for months for reasons he is unaware of. Anthony is taken to Dr. Sarai (Coronation Street's Ayesha Dharker) by Anne and is asked about his memory; he claims he has no memory problems. Anthony tells Laura about how proud he is of his daughter Lucy, who is a painter. Laura tells him she is very sorry about Lucy's accident, but Anthony is unaware of what she is referring to. Laura drops the subject and moves on to give him his medication. Over the course of the film, it is revealed that Anthony has really been living with Anne and Paul for years, Paul has also changed in appearance (Rufus Sewell). But Anthony believes he is still living in his private flat. The night Anne comes back with the chicken from the market, she and Paul have an argument over a vacation to Italy they had to cancel to look after Anthony due to his difficult behaviour with the caretaker, and about how much Anne sacrifices for her father. Paul asks Anthony how long he plans to stay in their flat and annoy everyone, and he slaps Anthony to the point of crying. Then a few moments later, Paul's appearance changes again (Mark Gatiss), and the argument and slapping repeat. Anthony wakes up in his room and walks out of the flat, only to find himself in a hospital hallway. He remembers his daughter Lucy (Imogen Poots) died in a car accident at the hospital. He sees her bloody body in the hospital room. At that moment, he wakes up in a completely different bedroom, now in a nursing home. His nurse, Catherine (Olivia Williams), checks in on him and informs him Anne has moved to Paris with Paul and visits on occasional weekends. Another nurse, Bill (Mark Gatiss), also visits during their interaction. Anthony has an emotional breakdown over his inability to understand what is going on anymore and Anne's disappearance. He becomes child-like and cries wanting his mother. Catherine comforts him as he sobs and tells him she'll take him outside for a walk in the park. Hopkins gives an astonishing performance as the elderly man suffering the devastating illness and constant paranoia and confusion, Colman is terrific as his concerned daughter saddened by his deteriorating mind, and the support of Poots, Sewell, Williams and Gatiss is perfect. What makes this film stand out, besides the extraordinary Hopkins and the fantastic script, is the clever editing and structure of storytelling, with distorted realities and dramatic shifts in perspective, the visual trickery and twists are a literal representation of what having dementia must be like, it is a breath-taking and emotionally engaging drama. It won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Editing, Best Production Design, and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, Outstanding British Film of the Year, Best Production Design, and Best Editing, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and Best Screenplay.

The storyline focuses on a man with Alzheimer's and how he deals with various transitions through life. His daughter does everything in her power to support him, both herself as well as by hiring help. His mental state is troubling to him, her and the help and as his mental state deteriorates tough decisions plague the family. This movie is directed by Florian Zeller in his directorial debut and stars Anthony Hopkins (Silence of the Lambs), Olivia Colman (Hot Fuzz), Mark Gatiss (Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy) and Rufus Sewell (Dark City). There isn't one aspect of this movie that isn't perfect. The acting by everyone in the cast is all time great and perfect. The depiction of what people with Alzheimer's go through and how it impacts their life's choices is perfectly presented. It also depicts how family's need to make tough decisions, often to their own detriment, and how they can be torn between their own happiness and the happiness of their family members.

I've never been a huge fan of Anthony Hopkins, I certainly respect him as an actor, and feel he is very talented, but for me he just didn't stand out in comparison to so many others. His role in this film not only changed my mind, as well as prove to be my favorite of his roles, but is done so incredibly well and so personal and emotional anyone with common sense will be blown away. It's such a well executed story, so raw and personal, without ever striving away from confusion, and feeling so complete in the process. It's truly a miracle of filmmaking, and besides a slightly slow start, I have absolutely nothing to complain about it. Olivia Colman holds her own in her supporting role as the aging Hopkin's daughter, and again you will be moved to tears by her performance. We have an excellent supporting cast to follow, but no one quite sticks out as much as those too, although Imogen Poots, despite her short runtime, does prove to be rather memorable. The score is brilliant, and so is the cinematography. Every aspect of this film seems developed to its full potential, and i've never left a film feeling so emotionally impacted, emotionally drained, and satisfied all at once. In the end, The Father is an experience i'll never forget, and certainly one of the best movies of the year.

87,7 October 2021,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7, A man out of time.,"If there's one flaw with 'The Father (2020)', it's that Hopkins' character seems to be able to perceive events he has yet to experience. The film uses nonlinearity, alongside a few other formalistic techniques that I won't spoil here, to convey how its protagonist's deteriorating mental state leaves him confused and feeling as though his world is changing around him. That's all fine and it usually works as intended, putting you in the increasingly disoriented headspace of the lead. Sometimes, though, the protagonist will reference, in specific detail, events that have actually happened in the film but not in its established chronology. Basically, he mentions things we've seen but he hasn't, things that are yet to occur to him. Of course, he could just be getting confused; that is a large part of the narrative, after all, and we're supposed to question the validity of some depicted events. However, the specificity of his assertions doesn't make him seem confused so much as precognitive. There is an argument to be made that the whole picture is a series of lucid memories that he's making his way through, the entire thing essentially taking place in his head at the very end of the plot, but that doesn't quite ring true because there are several scenes told from the perspective of his daughter which depict events he could never possibly have witnessed. Regardless of this, though, the movie still works well and achieves what it sets out to. Our lead is a man out of time due to his illness, and his condition comes across rather keenly. Even if the movie feels as though it's tripping over itself ever so slightly, it's ultimately successful at putting us in the increasingly frustrated and uncomfortable headspace of the protagonist. His world doesn't make sense, so perhaps that's why the film itself doesn't quite add up. I say 'quite' because other than the occasional bit of precognition, the narrative itself is relatively easy to keep up with. Its presented a bit like a puzzle, leaving you to figure out where each scene takes place within the flick's chronology and where the seams are between time jumps. It's an engaging effort and presents a distinct approach to its under-represented subject matter. The picture isn't quite as emotionally impactful as it perhaps could have been, for me at least, and there is the occasional sense that some further work could've been done to smooth the story's transition from stage to screen (there are a lot of monologues). In the end, though, this is a compelling and effective look into an ageing mind that properly conveys the horror of perhaps the most despicable disease known to man. 7/10.",

A nightmarish dream sequence in a hospital hallway recalls a similar passage in Michael Haneke's AMOUR (2012), another gerontological chef d'oeuvre, but THE FATHER is less poetic (no magical pigeons here), and more leans on evoking our empathy and compassion to Anthony's deterioration, like Julianne Moore's Oscar-winning vehicle STILL ALICE (2014).""",

Growing old is not the most pleasant experience, as we begin to lose our physical capabilities for even the simplest of tasks (opening bottles and cans, for instance). Growing very old is more of a curse than a blessing. Many of us want to live to 100, but we have no idea HOW we would be living when we are 100. Short-term memory loss is common, but dementia and Alzheimer's can be minimized with healthy lifestyles, diets, and exercise. But sometimes, it cannot be avoided. This film tackles that reality head-on. My mother at 96 and living in a home, thought I was a parish priest, and not her son. This film is far scarier than any horror movie ever made. Hopkins richly deserved his Oscar and the rest of the production crew was excellent. Great jobs in the supporting cast as well. Difficult film to watch; gut-wrenching at times, but a true classic.",

Throughout the film, we see escalating reactions from every person around Anthony as they get progressively more worried or aggressive, leaving him all the more confused. By the end, his condition worsens and the skips through reality just leave him completely broken.

Subtle changes of the scene with each shot and a real deja vu on conversations are then made to disorient and confuse you and put you into the shoes of Anthony Hopkins' character. It works very well indeed and near the end you don't know if you're coming or going. The last 5 minutes are overwhelmingly sad and hits home the subject matter of the film. From reading some of the low rating reviews it is clear these people have no clue what is a good film. Unless it's The Fast and the Furious or a no brainer action movie, it will be boring and confusing to them. To others who have a modicum of intelligence, an appreciation for good filmmaking and an understanding of the subject matter, this will be an absolutely outstanding gem with a strong resonating beat that cuts straight to the heart of you.

It's difficult to imagine how it would be to watch anyone who is going through this in real life; or indeed has a loved one with dementia. One of the things best aspects of this film is how, for the most part, we are watching the story from Anthony's perspective. We see him becoming confused and forgetful. With that comes a repetitiveness, often combined with confusion. As an audience we see events happen in different ways. We're not always sure about when things are happening, what time of day it is or how much time has passed. We see parts of the room change from scene to scene. Some of the actors and actresses change, signifying Anthony's inability to remember who people are. Sir Anthony Hopkins was magnificent in the role. Totally believable. Prior to watching this film, i always thought Chadwick Boseman deserved an Oscar for his performance, but now having seen this film, I have to rethink that idea as Sir Anthony Hopkins truly deserved his Best Actor Oscar. The supporting cast were also great. Technically, the production design and editing were brilliant. The way the sets and characters change from scene to scene means that we experience some of the confusion that he goes through was creative. The score was good too.

Anthony Hopkins delivers a wonderful performance, its interpretation is spotless. You can see the pain in his expressions, the confusion in his eyes and gestures. It is a punch of reality, directly on your face. The director managed to depict the sickness in a meaningful and truthful way: Anthony has its good moments where he laughs and he is full of life, but then, the more we go on, the more we see his condition getting worse and worse: he loses track of time and space, he swap events and people in his life, he is not able to think logically.

Moreover, the film does not (just) treat Anthony as an object of pity-he is also a figure of conflict and causes pain for his love ones. The film has a messy reality to it that I rather like.

I think they did an excellent job highlighting the fear that comes with this type of condition, and the family challenges that may develop.

198,26 March 2021,Benjamin-M-Weilert,7, A confusing but ultimately enlightening look into Alzheimer's.,"The failing mental health of an elderly parent is a perennial topic for critically-acclaimed movies. Most of the time, the focus is on how their supportive family watches them steadily deteriorate until they can do nothing else. The Father (2020) is one such film, but with a unique twist that makes it hit a lot harder than the standard Alzheimers fare. While attempting to present this disease from the aging parent's perspective is a bold choice, The Father leans into some radically artistic choices that might leave some viewers more confused than enlightened. I'm trying to avoid discussing the avant-garde method The Father uses to induce the kind of confusion that comes with Alzheimer's, mostly because I don't want to spoil the effect for anyone who hasn't seen this film yet. Needless to say, things make sense...eventually. The point isn't to understand it; it's to empathize with the main character. Of course, with the current era being what it is, even this fails to break through the dislike of the entitled, old white guy who ends up making things difficult for everyone around him. Anthony Hopkins certainly nails this role (especially at the end), and all the supporting characters are equally as strong in their performances. It's just that the role of an elderly white man is played almost too well. The stubbornness that Hopkins' character exudes is so frustrating as to make him entirely unsympathetic. If anything, I almost relate more to Paul (Rufus Sewell), who sees the detrimental effect Anthony is having on his daughter, Anne (Olivia Colman). I can only hope that I don't suffer from the same stubbornness when I get to the age where my mind is failing because it is not a good look on anyone. A confusing but ultimately enlightening look into Alzheimer's, I give The Father 3.5 stars out of 5.",

214,22 July 2022,dorMancyx,7, Time is Logic,"What was upfront appealing to me about this film was the delicate layout, stage-performance-ish cinematography, and sublime acting by both Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman, quickly establishing a suppressive father-daughter relationship through casual dialogues. Without precaution, the story began displaying contradictions of time, figures, and locations through the old father's perspective, which almost gave me the vibe of a good detective film. Having to comprehend the rationality behind the various objects, characters, and relationships was my main point of focus, which started to fatigue as a barrage of irrelevant information overwhelmed me. Another of the movie's emphasis was the complicated, discreet while mutually estranged kinship, which was implied though quite obvious. Colman put up a dejected, insecure, yet affecting-yearning daughter, swaying between filial piety and emancipation; Hopkins performed the father in gradual oblivion, losing memory, time, sanity, as his self-awareness fractured in the face of mortifying conversions and perceptions. Overall, exquisite performances, but the middle section was rather dull.",

218,14 March 2021,stevendbeard,7, Riveting Study of Alzheimer's,"I saw ""The Father"", starring Anthony Hopkins-Thor:Ragnarok, The Wolfman_2010; Olivia Colman-The Crown_tv, Hot Fuzz; Rufus Sewell-The Man in the High Castle_tv, Abraham Lincoln:Vampire Hunter and Imogen Poots-Popstar:Never Stop Never Stopping, Need For Speed.
This is an interesting story about a man that is getting older and how he sees things. It's based on a play by Florian Zeller, who also directs this movie. Anthony plays the old man that is living with his daughter, Olivia. Anthony keeps getting things wrong or seeing different versions of what he thinks things should be. For instance, one moment he will see Olivia and then he will turn around for a minute, and then he sees a different girl standing there, claiming to be Olivia. Rufus plays Olivia's husband and Imogen is a caretaker hired to take care of Anthony. Anthony starts believing that Olivia & Rufus are trying to take advantage of him by making him think he is crazy and have him institutionalized-so that they can take his apartment. Anthony's performance is riveting and you feel as if you really don't know what is going on-are they taking advantage of Anthony or does he have Alzheimer's? All is revealed in the end and either way, it is a riveting study of Alzheimer's.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for language and has a running time of 1 hour & 37 minutes.

240,10 September 2021,Horst_In_Translation,6, Hopkins' masterclass performances makes it easy to forget some screenplay flaws here and there,"""The Father"" is a new movie, well from 2020, and a co-production between the United Kingdom and France. The movie runs for under 100 minutes, so not a particularly long film by any means. And yet this was one of the biggest players from the previous awards season. The director is Florian Zeller and his career path can really be described as unusual. He launched his career through stage plays and mostly focused on these as well in recent years, even if here and there he also moved on to movies. So the smallest surprise here is probably that he wrote the screenplay himself. The bigger surprise is that he directed. And he did not have a co-director despite not being experienced at all in this department, but a co-writer. That would be Christopher Hampton and he has been in the industry for a long time and even won an oscar decades ago. Well, he won his second now. This is how successful this film turned out in the end and how audiences, critics and awards bodies loved it. Huge international breakthrough for Zeller too of course and we will see what will be next for him in the future. Certainly promising projects coming up. But as much as Zeller may have achieved behind the camera and with the pen in his hand (metaphorically), the heart and soul of this film was British actor Anthony Hopkins. You see him on the right of the imdb poster of course. He won his second Oscar for his portrayal here and even if he did not go into Oscar night as the frontrunner, not too many neutral observers were unhappy with Hopkins being announced as the winner at the very end, even after the Best Picture winner was announced this time. Hopkins was not there in America, maybe partially because of the pandemic and partially because of his age and the distance, but he recorded a little thank you message the following day if I remember correctly in which he also made a short reference to the late Chadwick Boseman that most people were expecting to win. More on Hopkins later.",

Watching someone,s personality, intelligence and memories fade is horrific to witness and if you are part of those fading memories, the pain and hurt of Olivia Colmans performance is real. Hopkins acts the ever changing mood and behaviours which not only is terrifying for those with dementia but for those who try to hold on to the love they have for the person they used to be.

265,13 July 2021,wolfstar_imdb,7, This is a worst-case scenario - it's possible to live well with dementia for years,"As good as this was, what was missing for me was an acknowledgement that what we're seeing is advanced dementia, and particularly severe at that - someone who is not just frightened, confused and forgetful, but paranoid, aggressive and suspicious. The film perfectly captures what the final 6 weeks with my dad were like before he went into care, and how he often continued to behave while in care. It also conveys how frightening a large aggressive man with dementia can be to those trying to care for him, as well as the terror of alienation when a loved one with dementia turns against you. As a couple of other reviewers have commented, most of the characters don't handle the man's condition well and act in ways that make him more agitated - the fact that even experienced care professionals are shown repeatedly asking him ""What do you mean?"" and ""Do you remember?"", and being surprised that he forgets things even when his condition is clearly severe, simply isn't realistic and is used to artificially drive the point home. There's no sense that his family and carers have acclimatised to the situation and learned to modify their behavior, when in fact that's one of the first things that happens when you have a loved one with dementia.",
