0,23 May 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,10, The truly epic blockbuster we needed.,"Wow. The first Top Gun is a classic, and as we all know, sequels/remakes rarely beat the original, especially 36 years later e.g. The Matrix Resurrections. Well, this film just broke that theory.",/
1,26 May 2022,scottedwards-87359,10," This is slightly different to the other reviews, please stay with me here.","If you were a late teen or in your early twenties in the mid 1980's the world was very different. No computers, no mobile phones, no internet, no DVD's. We had cars though, and bikes, and we loved them, and we loved films too. The original Top Gun captured this moment in time perfectly, and gave us a thrilling ride like we had never seen before. The humour, the games, the bikes, the aircraft and my word, those flying scenes. We went back to the cinema to see it again and again, and spent the following decades quoting the movie. As time went on, it remained like a static snapshot in time to perfectly represent that magical point in our lives for so many of us.",r
2,25 May 2022,GusherPop,10, Best Sequel yet,"In one of the more memorable lines in the original Top Gun, Maverick gets chewed out by a superior who tells him, ""Son, your ego's writing checks your body can't cash."" Sometimes I wonder if Tom Cruise took that putdown as a personal challenge. No movie star seems to work harder or push himself further than Cruise these days. Ridiculously entertaining Top Gun: Maverick. Cruise was in his early 20s when he first played Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, the cocky young Navy pilot with the aviator sunglasses, the Kawasaki motorcycle and the need for speed. In the sequel, he's as arrogant and insubordinate as ever: Now a Navy test pilot in his late 50s, Maverick still knows how to tick off his superiors, as we see in an exciting opening sequence where he pushes a new plane beyond its limits. Partly as punishment, he's ordered to return to TOPGUN, the elite pilot-training school, and train its best and brightest for an impossibly dangerous new mission. And so the three screenwriters of Top Gun: Maverick - including Cruise's regular Mission: Impossible writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie - have taken the threads of the original and spun them into an intergenerational male weepie, a dad movie of truly epic proportions. They're tapping into nostalgia for the original, while aiming for new levels of emotional grandeur. To that end, the soundtrack features a Lady Gaga song, ""Hold My Hand."" It's nowhere near as iconic a chart topper as the original movie's ""Take My Breath Away,"" but tugs at your heartstrings nonetheless. The action sequences are much more thrilling and immersive than in the original. You feel like you're really in the cockpit with these pilots, and that's because you are: The actors underwent intense flight training and flew actual planes during shooting. In that respect, Top Gun: Maverick feels like a throwback to a lost era of practical moviemaking, before computer-generated visual effects took over Hollywood. You start to understand why Cruise, the creative force behind the movie, was so driven to make it: In telling a story where older and younger pilots butt heads, and state-of-the-art F-18s duke it out with rusty old F-14s, he's trying to show us that there's room for the old and the new to coexist. He's also advancing a case for the enduring appeal of the movies and their power to transport us with viscerally gripping action and big, sweeping emotions.",e
3,27 May 2022,dtucker86,10, This is why we go to the movies,"This is one sequel that looked like it would never get made. It was stuck in development ""hell"" for years and years. Then it was delayed by COVID and other issues. Its almost as if we were not meant to see a sequel to Top Gun. But now it is here and the question is, was it worth the wait? The answer is a resounding yes. This is the only sequel I have ever seen that i liked BETTER then the original. EVERYTHING about this film rocks! Tom Cruise is sixty this year but he can still do the job! He is awesome as Maverick capturing emotions and giving a performance that he hasn't given since A Few Good Men. You see Maverick's innate cockiness (something all fighter pilots have I'm sure) but you also see his vulnerability and his pain especially the scenes where he talks about his dead wingman's son and how he can't bear the thought of him dying as well. Jennifer Connally and Miles Teller give great performances as well playing Maverick's love interest and Goose's son. Yes you 1980's music lovers we get to hear Kenny Loggin's Danger Zone at the beginning it is wonderful nostalgia. Oh and I should also mention the aieral sequences are the best and most intense in movie history you are on the edge of your seat the whole time. To wrap it all up I wanted to mention the touching scene where Maverick goes to see his old Top Gun classmate ""Iceman"" who is now an Admiral and dying of throat cancer. Val Kilmer looks so bad because he has had throat cancer and can no longer speak well. The scene is so sad but they have a joke at the end where he asks Maverick who the best pilot is? Go see this movie by all means!",v

11,30 May 2022,kosmasp,10, Talk to me Goose,"It makes more than sense to have seen the first Maverick movie. I am writing this with that in mind. Actually I would even argue that the rating also had something to do with it. Watching it on the big screen also helps a lot of course. My summary line is actually a quote from the movie. Not just the first one, but one that is being said here too. And you will get the full impact of that sentence, of those words, if you know what they mean and why they are said.",4

I totally enjoyed the film as I watched it with a helping of popcorn. There were moments where I felt excited, emotional and even laughed along with the other viewers. It delivers light, simple and sweet entertainment in a delicious mix of action, drama, some romance and humor in a delightful manner.",9

Everything that we want and expect in the long-awaited sequel to the 1986 film is present. It's a movie spectacle featuring one of the few remaining bonafide movie stars front and center, as well as breathtaking action sequences that beg to be experienced on the largest screen possible and with the highest quality audio available. Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr are credited for the characters, while the new screenplay involved collaboration from Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, Christopher McQuarrie, Peter Craig, and Justin Marks. The original film's director, Tony Scott, passed away in 2012 at age 68, and Joseph Kosinski (OBLIVION, 2013, also starring Tom Cruise) takes the helm.",4

I was surprised how good this movie was, it's terrific. Also was great to see no woke nonsense and strong characters, thank you Tom Cruise.",1
16,25 May 2022,nihal-38544,9, TOM CRUISE YOU LEGEND!,This is one of the best theatrical experiences I've had and I'm so happy someone has taken the practical route rather than throwing everyone into a green screen. I watched the first one many times and I can't believe this just topped it by a huge margin. Tom Cruise will be written as the most passionate filmmaker in history. I mean to put a whole cast in a bunch of f-18 jets and act in a jet as well as film yourself is a huge deal. If this movie does not cross a billion then there is something wrong with taste that people have these days. So called marvel fans. This is what you call a cinematic experience. Not some cropped cgi scenes.,6

18,31 May 2022,UniqueParticle,10, Holy cow such a great IMAX experience!,"Tom Cruise is still an ultimate being at 59 years old it's outstanding! Top Gun: Maverick deserves so much for how practical everything is. Great the IMDb rating is 8.7 hope it stays high, should even get awards. The music hit the spot, cinematography is beautiful, the story flow well, and the acting is incredible so much so that even though Val Kilmer has mouth cancer in real life he has a small part in the film. I like how the main characters trained for a near impossible mission that all was built up quite well.",?

27,13 June 2022,radhrh,6, More corn than the Jolly Green Giant,"I drove an hour each way to see this in a movie theater, my first visit to one a couple of years because I wanted to get the full cinematic experience. What I got was a huge pile of corn. If not for the flying sequences, which are awesome, the rest of the movie is a bit pants. Ed Harris is in it for a single scene, more of a cameo role than anything. Val Kilmer's scene was embarrassing. Jennifer Connelly is looking her age and plays a half baked love interest which frankly the film could have done without. Is she supposed to be the Kelly McGillis role from the original movie? She lives in a very similar house and she drives a Porsche so who knows? The plot revolves around a mission so uniquely unlikely that it makes the movie slightly preposterous. The cast of pilots don't hold a candle to the original cast and their characters are two dimensional and boring. It isn't Tom Cruise's best performance either playing the eponymous Maverick, a man still plagued by the death of his buddy, Goose from the first movie. Come on, man. That was 35 years ago, get over it FFS! Jon Hamm, who I normally like doesn't look comfortable playing Maverick's up tight commander and there's a scene of beach football which is supposed to mirror the volleyball scene from the first movie but just looks gay AF. Once again the flying scenes are unbelievable, by that I mean extremely believable. The actors must have actually been in the planes for at least some of the shots and CGI has been kept to a minimum which is great to see. But take away those sequences, which don't account for much run time, maybe 15% of total run time, and what you have left is quite poor.",u
28,28 May 2022,masonsaul,10, One of the best sequels ever,"Top Gun: Maverick accomplishes a very rare feat of being a long gestating sequel that is not only worthy of the original but actually better than it. Managing to retain the spirit of the original whilst also adding stronger stakes, a more emotionally involving narrative and better written characters.",r
29,25 May 2022,HabibieHakim123,10, BEST FILMS OF THE YEAR SO FAR!!!,"Basically my only problem with the first Top Gun is the relationship between Maverick and Charlie, the love story, i'm fine with them at first but later on i don't care anymore, that's it, the rest of the first Top Gun was badass, it was great and it was fascinating, Top Gun: Maverick, a long wait sequel, my first problem with this movie is nothing, zero, and yes there is still a love story in this one but i like it, it did not bother me at all, i'm fine with it, is it necessary? No, but Jennifer Connelly performance is convincing enough, the rest of Top Gun: Maverick is a visually well done film, the movie succeed to make me feel so intense and it's really probably the most intense feeling i got in a non-horror movie, the movie is also surprisingly emotionally moving, Maverick is never been a guy that i was that adored, and as a character a fanatic, but somehow someway i feel like i was know him longer than ever, i feel closer to him more than ever, and i was care to him way more than ever, all the new Top Gun team is as exciting as the previous one and probably even more, Miles Teller is really the second best performance in here next to Tom Cruise, a very very powerful performances by Miles Teller, the music like the first one was great, the score, and of course the whole plane sequence was just terrific, overall Top Gun: Maverick is one of those movie that you have to watch in the theaters not only because it's a great movie but the sound and the visual is a big screen only experience, it's a way better movie than the first one too, i loved every second of this movie, it is truly a very emotional ride, it's a very fun ride, it's a very intense ride, and at in the end the whole movie is a fantastic ride, Top Gun: Maverick is so far for me the best films of the year.",v
30,15 June 2022,zac-04879,5," An Unpopular Opinion: Overrated, Overhyped and Aimless","The new, acclaimed and horribly popular Top Gun sequel is just the same boring blockbuster with the latest special effects to appeal to the standards these days. The cinemas will be absolutely packed and the movie will keep striking hits at the box office, but it's just Tom Cruise returning for another 2-hour round of exciting dogfights, poor story and bad pacing.",
31,3 February 2023,schuwomann,3, WTF did I just watch,"I had pretty high hopes for this movie. I enjoyed the original when it came out when I was a kid. I don't think I've seen it since then. I can't believe the original got worse ratings than this sequel. This movie is just not that great, I'm sorry to say. The acting is crap. I don't remember Tom Cruise being this bad. I loved Jerry Maguire! Anyway, I don't even care that the big mission was completely unfeasible. I have a problem with the rest of the storyline being completely hackneyed and derivative. This movie is too much like the original, for example, Goose's son is Rooster (also a fowl name), his son also has a moustache, he also plays the piano AND played the exact same song at the same bar his father played in all those years ago. *eye roll* Same old story with the top brass not liking Maverick coz he always breaks the rules, they give him a hard time, he almost gets kicked out of the navy but then turns out to be a hero. *yawn* As others have mentioned, there is zero character development in anyone. The dialogue is insipid. I was so bored I tuned out about 75 minutes in. The story is predictable and uninteresting. The ""romance"" between Maverick and Penny is flat and uninspired. They had no spark or chemistry, but that is probably because THE WRITING SUCKED.",
32,11 June 2022,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,10, There are very few movies whose second movie is better than the first,"It was a movie I expected, but it was a much better movie than I expected. There are very few movies whose second movie is better than the first, this movie is one of them. There were a lot of good things in the movie. Watching it in the cinema made the viewing pleasure better. I liked it very much. In addition, ""Danger Zone"" was indispensable and the first scene of the movie was happy Tom Cruise, bravo to you. Watch this movie now, but definitely in the cinema!",
33,30 May 2022,zkonedog,10, What The Cinematic Experience Is All About,"In recent years, developments like cheap large-screen TVs, internet fast enough to support seamless streaming content, and work-from-home edicts/trends have rendered film largely a stay-at-home experience. There are certainly some pros to this: cheap snacks, on-demand viewing, and not having to venture out into the general public for mass-consumption of entertainment. But all that said, there is still something about the cinematic experience that captures the imagination--the big screen, the immersive sound, the live reactions/buzz, and the conversations afterward. Just the opportunity to ""get out"" might be underrated at this point. For all of us who enjoy such excursions and want more of them in the future, Top Gun: Maverick is the film we all needed.",
34,5 February 2023,shelleyalevin,3, Blah,"I don't understand the overwhelming positive reaction to this film. The writing is so so soooooo lazy. It's like they just thought, ""we need to have a scene that reminds the audience of this part of the original, we need to have a scene that reminds the audience of that part of the original."" It's beyond predictable, reductive, and overly familiar. I get that it's a sequel but this is ridiculous. And Jennifer Connelly - who I usually like very much - is really annoying in this. I don't necessarily blame her, though, I think it's the writing and directing. A real positive though is this: Miles Tenner is perfectly cast.",
35,27 August 2022,sudiniup,7, Flying scenes good,"Sorry, but I thought this was a boring movie. It was nostalgic, but it was also boring. The flight scenes and action scenes were great. But the dialogue was dull, full of cliched sentences. I don't think the writers on top of their game, and it's a shame because this could have been a very good movie, it needed better writing. Even the music was not inspiring. I don't know why this movie has such high ratings, probably the nostalgia and flying action was truly outstanding. It was good to see Tom Cruise in action again, he is a true star and a it seems he can do anything. I wish he had hired better writers for the dialogue.",
36,27 May 2022,Fluke_Skywalker,7, Cruise remains a Top Gun,"Hollywood had lost its way long before streaming services and a global pandemic nearly made going to the cinema obsolete. Content to strip mine the comic book genre and reboot/reimagine and regurgitate beloved franchises, it had become stale and tired. It's ironic then that a sequel to a nearly 40 year old film (You read that right. Scary isn't it?) might be the thing that points the way to their salvation.",

Filmmaker Joseph Kosinski pulls out all the stops by filming in IMAX with some truly astounding aerial footage with the real actors in the planes (um not CGI'd!) with hairy situations aplenty as well as touch stoning with the original's vibe including a touching reunion with Kilmer's Iceman.

53,28 May 2022,Joxerlives,8, Can't remember the last time I smiled so much in the cinema!,"This was just such FUN! When I was leaving the cinema people were openly saying how good it was and I had to agree. Ok so large part of it don't make much sense, why do they have to attack with such a small force (in a scenario straight out of Star Wars), why not have the rest of the squadron perform flak suppression on the SAM sites? Lots of homages to the first film not to mention 'The Right Stuff' but had to admit was on the edge of my seat when Mav went to Mach 10. Great gag when he walks into the diner in his burnt flight suit and asks where he is only for the kid to reply ""Earth!"". I think the romance between Mav and Penny was good although I far preferred her before her reduction surgery. Shame they couldn't have got Kelly McGillis back to play Iceman's wife, would have been an nice touch. Speaking of which that was the most emotional part of the film (far more so than all the daddy stuff), seeing Cruise and Kilmer together in a situation that wasn't too far from real life, I highly recommend everyone watch the documentary 'Val' although it is rather heart-breaking. So was it cheesy? Yes, very much so. But was it 2 hours of action, 1980s nostalgia and first rate entertainment? Yes and I would highly recommend it.",

60,18 June 2022,pc95,5, Tom Cruise's Victory-Lap on the Beaten Path,"I remember watching Top Gun in the theater as a kid in the summer of 1986. It was loud, fast, frat-like, macho - fun for a 9 year old. Did it have the foundation for a sequel? - Nope. But don't mind that, Hollywood sees money to be made, and made it, it has. This ""sequel"" Maverick, hence its title, is a ridiculous and overlong victory-lap for Tom Cruise, replete with him thanking us in a pre-show message amid giggles. Wouldn't have gone myself, but was asked to go. You'll have to suspend disbelief on many levels to allow for this movie just to start with. The Jet scenes can be well shot, but ridiculous, and the story is way overlong and superficial - nothing more than a rehash of the last with less interesting characters to try to balance Cruise's ego-centrism. The video-game-ish plot is paper mache. Younger characters are extras for Cruise. 1986 was a fun time but trying to recapture a mediocre movie from 35+ years ago can't generate anything better than mediocrity, and for this reviewer its actually worse. Leave it alone. We were laughing at some of scenes - straight cheese.",

He is called into a meeting where he's told that Admiral Cain is planning to shut down the program, that Maverick is being transferred back to the Top Gun, this time as a teacher. Before Cain arrives, Maverick takes the hypersonic prototype on one more flight, attempting to reach speeds of 10G. At this point we are 10 min into the movie.",
63,12 September 2022,fuelrodx,10, Absolute Killer,I've always been a fan in the fighter jet world having gone to many military airshows. Navy pilots tend to be the most aggressive in their flying that it puts a tear in my eye. This was the coolest way to do a movie of this type. The flight scenes were just great and you feel like you're right there with em. One of the pilots told Tom that he was never going to do the maneuver they did ever again. This maneuver was at 50ft and he said it was too dangerous. Knowing the speeds that these guys fly you could eat 50 ft in a split second and find yourself in the ground. They must have really been pushing it.,

It's hard ti explain what's so great about the is film and when you explain it to people they just say ok and I've said you just need to experience it and then you'll understand. It's definitely a theatre movie also. It's grand epic blockbuster in every way.

Amazing set designs, incredible character building, action sequences that are perfectly choreographed. This is one of the, if not, most ambitious films with a flawless execution. The fact that the director's vision is so blended with Tom Cruise and other actors is very effective on the traceability of the film. Tom Cruise is a machine.

The original TOP GUN never did it for me, I was never a fan of the back-slapping, gung-ho stainless steel films that Hollywood puts out, and the storyline of this one is equally shoddy. Cruise is now a top trainer for a new dashing young crew, but of course they figure out a way to reference the Edwards character and also bring back Kilmer for a key cameo. The second half of the film is given over to combat with an unidentified enemy country leading to bombing raids and the like at the climax. The aerial scenes are beautifully filmed and probably the most realistic ever depicted on screen; I just wish they had more substance to go with them.",

I also dare to say, that most who like the first movie will like this one too. The greatest con: what Maverick mostly misses is an interesting story. The story is of very simplistic nature, a very basic one that we all - in whatever context set - watched a zillion times before. For sure Maverick is good pop-corn cinema with some fine moments, and tasty for the right audience, but not as good as many reviewers here on Imdb claim boldly. In my opinion for example, The Edge of Tomorrow is the far stronger movie - it got good acting, a fine production, lots of action and spectacular visuals too, but, last but not least, a well crafted and superior script (compared to Maverick). Exact rate: 7 + 1 for the spectacular visuals. A fine flight, but not an excellent one.",

84,24 June 2022,aidanratesmovies,9, The rare sequel that surpasses the original,"Never being a big fan of the 1986 original and consequently feeling very unhopeful about this one, Top Gun Maverick surprised the hell out of me as both a fantastic action film and heartfelt drama. There are so many elements of this film that you truly just have to see to believe- everything works in such a smooth manner it ends up feeling so well crafted that it's honestly hard not to be impressed. Tom Cruise makes his return to his iconic character Maverick and does a fantastic job (as always), alongside Miles Teller's rooster who was everything I hoped his performance would be. Unlike the 1986 original, this film feels a lot more fleshed out. It has a decent plot and story structure and although those are clearly not the most important things to this movie- it takes the time to set up everything in a meaningful manner that allows you to care about the characters at hand rather than just watch planes flying across the screen. The cinematography is electric, and much better than its burnt orange counterpart- and the film in general doesn't at all feel repetitive or bland in its storytelling- in fact it's quite thrilling to watch at times. Being on the edge of my seat, watching Tom Cruise guide youngsters into uncertain undescriptive danger may feel like a bit of a cliche at this point- but it works so well in so many ways that I could not help but enjoy almost every minute of it. In the end, Top Gun Maverick pulls off the impossible- a sequel better than its predecessor- and puts Cruise on the map yet again as America's greatest action star.",
85,26 May 2022,Sergiodave,9, Way better than I could have ever hoped for,"I saw this last night on IMAX, which for this movie is a must, the sound and picture quality is pretty essential. I thought the original was great fun, a little bit too homoerotic, but well made with great flying sequences. A movie I loved as a kid in the 80's but got less enthused as I aged. This movie beats the original hands down, and I would put it in my top 10 sequels. The flying sequences are the best anyone has ever seen on celluloid, the story is a clever one, which I won't spoil, but is full of little surprises. The cast are all great and the directing from Joseph Kosinski is amazing. I'll go to the cinema 40+ times this year and I strongly doubt I'll see a better blockbuster in 2022. Well done.",
86,24 June 2022,AscendeSuperius,10, The sequel to the prequel,"To those who thought the first one was good, this one just blows it out of the water. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that this one felt more like the true 'Top Gun' with the first feeling more like a prequel more than anything else. While the first felt more like a Air force romance / bromance story, this one really focused on the man behind the mission, and it was it done perfectly. This film brought exhilarating to a whole new level, true edge-of your-seat excitement. The equally excellent emotional scenes is just the cherry on top. Truly a film that has surpassed my expectations immensely.",

It's so rare to see movies like this anymore, and thank god Tom Cruise and his production team are pushing the envelope with films like these because Hollywood is in desperate need of some inspiration. The level of skill it took to achieve what they did with this movie cannot be understated.",
88,24 May 2022,cadillac20,9, An Epic Blockbuster Even Better Than The Original,"Top Gun has been an 80's staple since it first released and remains a classic action film to this day. Even so, it's hard to believe they would come back to it over 30 years later. When it was first announced that this would be happening, bringing back a now nearly 60 year old Tom Cruise as character Maverick, I was highly skeptical. Shouldn't Maverick be retired by now? The trailers for the film didn't do much to sway my opinion. Then the positive reviews came in and I was still skeptical.",

Here is a Pete Mitchell who's still reckless but also humbled by past mistakes. Regret has hit this guy in the solar plexus, and it's a good opportunity for Tom Cruise to bring some maturity to the role. Yeah, he's passing the torch, but he's doing so to some decent characters. I enjoy the '86 film for the MTV/Bruckheimer relic that it is (I mean this respectfully) but this is easily the superior movie.

Born on the Fourth of July was a huge exception, though. I thought he was excellent in that. Even in Magnolia, which was praised, I felt him forcing his emotions a bit. He just wanted it so bad. Somewhere along the line his performances relaxed a bit. His intensity is still there, which is a GREAT thing for an actor to have, but that forced or stiffed quality was gone. He finally just became the cool cat movie star that he is. And now we come to this. Top Gun Maverick. The culmination of all the dues he's paid and all his past performances. This is his masterpiece performance. The quintessential Tom Cruise movie. In all its glory.",

Best role for Cruise in quite a while, really brought some depth to the character. Very touching to see Val Kilmer reprise his role. You'd swear these two had really been friends for 35 years.

One that tells a great story, has great acting, doesn't get woke preachy, and you exit smiling, wanting more, and thinking about it for hours and sometimes days. This movie is one of those. A great flick. I do think that if you did not experience the Top Gun of the 80's in the 80's, then you might not experience the nostalgia that they obviously took advantage of - in a really good way. Regardless, Cruise and the entire crew should be proud. If Hollywood made more like this we'd spend alot more time (and money) in the theaters.

They took everything that was great about the original Top Gun and made it 10 times better. And somehow without losing it's soul.. This very much feels like the original movie only bigger and better. Basically the Terminator 2 of our generation. Seems to me like they made what they wanted to make in 1986 but couldn't because the technology didn't exist yet..

157,12 June 2022,shakercoola,7, Visceral blast of hyperrealist afterburner thrills,"An American action film; A story about a serviceman, one of the U. S. Navy's top aviators, who, after more than thirty years of service, dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him, is approached for a career-defining mission. As a long anticipated sequel to one of the top ten box-office successes of the 1980s, it inevitably draws comparison with the original. The first film averaged out as mediocre; in the sky it flew, on the ground it faltered; aerial sequences were arresting, but back at base the pilot with a need for speed fought poor dialogue and a romantic pairing which produced little chemistry. Thirty-six years on, Top Gun Maverick averages out better as a stand-alone film. Some of the power undoubtedly came from viewers recalling Cruise's original appeal and use of the original film's striking soundtrack. The drama, while written thinly, is not quite as thick with American exceptionalism and competitive machismo as the original, and it eschews the macho posturing which made the original distinctive, if at times overweening. It has many of the hallmarks that made the original attractive without retreading the story. Although formulaic, familiar, routine, with plot twists that creak a little when it forces the story's envelope, it is an exhilirating action picture and has some outstanding aerial footage. A new theme, letting go of the past in order to move on, seems poignant and nostalgic, for Cruise as an actor seems to be looking in on his past to face his own advancing years; he is rolling back the years for a generation who recall their own youth. All in all, a film without pretension, a first rate cinematic experience.",

I really loved the air sequences, cannot say right now another movie to highlight in that regard. Again, air sequences are fantastic. FANTASTIC. So real, so natural view, so immersive. Sound is great and of course IMAX is recommended. I loved the cast, all of them are nice and welcomed additions. There are some very emotional scenes that worth the ticket alone. Plot, is made to enjoy. Every bit. Lovely references to prior movie and superb cinematography. Music is good, however didn't find a new classic song for my particular taste, but maybe there is one for you. Super enjoyable product, the one that put you to search where to learn to fly.

Everything about this movie was straight up perfect. The cast was amazing, I like the fact that there was a mix of blacks and white in there and even at the top level, it wasn't all white. Kudos to the team for doing that. I loved the pace. This would be such a ride for old fans of Top Gun. Bringing back clips from the old, fusing it into the storyline, bringing in the next generation of Top Gun Pilots was just impeccable. Even though you knew the action was delaying, I didn't mind the build up process at all, from the training to the romance to the son, father, father friend drama, it all came together real nice at the end. Because of that, you developed a relationship with the main characters and I was just hoping that none of them would die. All in all it was an amazing watch.

178,8 January 2023,dalyons-09311,10, Perfect Legacy Sequel,"This is an excellent example of why so many legacy sequels have failed. So many movies nowadays take the ""next generation"" approach to their storytelling, that our heroes that we loved years ago serve no other purpose except to train the younger people and then die. When it was announced that Star Wars sequels were coming, I told my family that there's only one thing I want to see, and that's Luke Skywalker as a peak force user and Jedi. But Disney gave us none of that, and instead, Luke's only purpose was to train Rey for a few days and then die. It wasn't until The Mandalorian that my wish was finally fulfilled. This is the trap that legacy sequels fall into. They take the things we loved and burn them to make something new. Top Gun: Maverick does not do that. It is set up like that and is about Maverick training the next generation, but make no mistake, Maverick is in the title because this is a story about Maverick. He is the hero of this movie, not any of the kids we don't care about. That was so refreshing to see. This is a legacy sequel that knows what we want to see. Rather than trying too hard to create something new, it gives us more of what we loved so much about the first one (in addition to giving us something new). Hopefully people learn from this example. Beyond my thoughts about the movie conceptually, it's a fantastic movie. I highly recommend watching the behind the scenes features where they explain how Tom put the actors through a flight training program and guided people through the choreography. It's fascinating. As a result of what they did, the flight scenes feel so exhilarating. I'm not one for praising movies for being authentic or historically accurate, but in this case, the authenticity actually makes the experience more exciting, as if you're flying the aircraft. It's a filmmaking marvel. The soundtrack is great, and I love how Hans Zimmer wove Lady Gaga's song into the soundtrack. The heartfelt moments are earned and work really well. You care about the characters. The movie has one small issue, which is that the Penny plot dragged a bit. She really didn't need to be there. If Penny showed up in the first movie, I would've felt differently, but this is a character that came out of a quick throwaway line that we're supposed to care about. Luckily, while I think it's a waste, it's not annoying, so it doesn't hurt my rating.",

After $1.4 billion+ worldwide gross earnings at the box office and nonstop heavy promotion, I feel compelled to join the bandwagon to revel in this cinematic experience. Fifteen minutes in, I am still giving the movie the benefit of the doubt that something ground-breaking is about to happen. Instead, the shallow, cheesy dialogue continues for the rest of the movie, making all of the characters one-dimensional, even Maverick. Why is Maverick so humble and smiling all the time while the rest of the characters are obnoxious braggarts? It seems that the budget is mostly focused on the set, props, and g-force training for the actors, and they've forgotten to come up with a good script and decent character development. The casting of Jennifer Connelly is a poor choice. Next to the charming Tom Cruise, she has zero charm and therefore there is zero chemistry between them.

It's one of those movies where you lose all track of time except the part where you you didn't want time to end because the movie was just too good. Cruise was excellent. He always is, but he really did this well and made the original movie proud. It's becoming trendy to bring back 80's and 90's movies these days (See Karate Kid). Cruise and his team really knocked this out of the park.

215,30 August 2022,bryanmartin1,10, Incredible Movie Making,I remember watching the first film back when it first came out in theaters. I wondered how any film could ever compare to the original. This work of art answers everyone's question to that. Tom Cruise and the rest of the team that brought this thing together are to be commended. Heart pounding action. Incredible flight scenes. A great script to finish out the story. I especially liked that they brought back Val Kilmer for continuity on the story line. Tom Cruise is truly a movie making genius. Watch it in the theater or on as big a screen with the best speakers possible. You won't be disappointed.,

Handsome leading male and female roles, intensive fighting scenes (I noticed that everyone sat at the edge of their seats!), right amount of small jokes, and, patriotism. Everyone should be happy about all the diversity we see today (even this movie we see it from the final pilot selection. Good job!). But it is really good to have such a movie whose aesthetic can meet the needs of both the liberals and the conservatives, the young and the old, the men and the women. It is exactly what we need now in the US.",

The cheesy acting is as good as i remember from the original, and they only really concentrate on the relationship between Cruise and Teller, Conelly is a bit of a side show. However, portraying american fighter jets as the underdogs when they have a larger miltary budget than the whole of europe combined is laughable. Also, they dont generally carry out operations for the good of mankind. Had they been fighting for oil or resources it would have been more believable.",
218,2 October 2022,drodgers-39391,10, Badass 👌,Maverick was even better than the first Top Gun and that's saying alot. Top Gun is badass and has always been one of my favorite movies. Normally when they make a 2nd movie it's just not as good as the first but they exceeded as good and went beyond. We have watched it several times. But if you haven't watched it in surround sound then do yourself a favor and watch it with surround sound. Loved that they included Val in this one it just wouldn't have been the same without him. Of course Tom Cruise didn't disappoint either he's an absolute badass when it comes to Top Gun. I highly recommend this movie.,
219,21 June 2022,classicsoncall,10," ""Alright sweetheart, one last ride"".","The film will have been out only a month tomorrow (as I write this), and it already has almost twenty four hundred reviews here on IMDb as it ranks in the Top Fifty of viewer all-time movie ratings. I saw the original ""Top Gun"" from 1986 only a couple years ago, but I'm glad I didn't hesitate to see this one just yesterday. The flight scenes are an adrenaline rush if there ever was one in moving pictures, and I defy anyone to state that it's impossible to not be in the cockpit when Pete 'Mavarich' Mitchell leads his F-18 fighter crew on the raid against an Iranian enrichment plant. If anything, I thought that was an intended tweak against the terrorist nation that the film makers sought to marginalize with the story line. I can't imagine the mullahs are very happy about the outcome of that little put-down against their regime. In real life, the successful raid against the enemy target here may not seem very realistic, but who cares when you hear the roar of those jets and experience the in-flight maneuvers of accomplished pilots performing those daredevil theatrics. The emotional ending with 'Hangman' (Glen Powell) making the save for Mitchell and wingman 'Rooster' Bradshaw (Miles Teller) is about as pulse pounding as it gets when it comes to movie finales, so if you haven't seen the picture yet, let this be your recommendation to get to your nearest theater to experience the excitement.",
220,2 June 2022,zeio-4,10, A rare sequel - this one is actually better than the original.,"A rare sequel - this one is actually better than the original. If this was a stand alone movie it would be a seven/eight of ten. But as a sequel navigating the modern outrage mobs and other cantankerous spoilers and wreckers waiting in the wings to bring anything good down this thing is a solid ten. Tom Cruise doesn't look almost 60, he is in unreal shape for any age, but the work and dieting he must put in to look like this at 59 is nothing short of amazing. There is less cheese than was in the first movie, the music is great, and to see these people grunting and huffing while pulling real g-force maneuvers in real airplanes is so great. Tom Cruise had to take a huge amount of abuse to make this a reality - you can see the actors in planes sweating and suffering tunnel vision and black outs and redouts. One must have a healthy respect for Tom Cruise for being one of the very very few in hollyweird that actually cares enough about his craft to put in the work. I hope this kicks off a new wave of serious remakes that can even outshine the original if done right and I hope this kicks off a new wave of movies that skip the idiotic computer generated trash and get back to practical effects like this movie. This is basically an 80's movie done right - take all the good music and good looking people, reduce the cheese and come up with an engaging multi-faceted multi-layered plot that develops emotion and take it to eleven on a scale of ten. Even if the scenario and outcome is unrealistic nobody cares because the practical effects make it far more watchable than the hot garbage superhero movies and everyone is having so much fun we just want to see the happy ending. Great movie, exceptional sequel and if this thing had actually come out in the 1980s it would have melted everyone's face off in disbelief. For this practical effects movie to do so well in 2022 is a testament to its greatness. The people who made this movie earned a high rating and a big box office return. This type of movie could save the cinema and bring people back to theatres.",

The consistency of the staged story with the first part of the film gave the film a character of enthusiasm and was overshadowed by the memories of
year 1986. Tom Cruise is a wonderful actor and offers a lot through acting in his films. I think he is the type who makes the film and the filming staffs an important part of his life. That is why we see his creativity in his films even at this age. I'm sure this film will ne nominated for several Oscars for video editing and soundtrack, because of its wonderful effects.",

If you look @ the BTS of the film the cast went through a lot of training by taking the camera into the fighter jets! Tom Cruise is so fun to watch this is so much better than The Mummy (2017) watching this makes me more excited for Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One! There are a lot of callbacks to the first Top Gun which I'm not going to get into cuz spoilers! It's nice to see Miles Teller in this the last time I saw him on the big screen was Only the Brave which is the same director; Joseph Kosinski who worked with him before! The most fun I had with the movie was the fighter jet scenes! Overall I enjoyed this so much that I haven't seen an enjoyable flick since Spider-Man: No Way Home! I would love to see this again and I'm giving this one an 8/10 have fun in cinemas!!! ;),

Training a detachment of graduates for a special assignment, Maverick must confront the ghosts of his past and his deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who choose to fly it.",

229,28 May 2022,Quinoa1984,8," A great quality beefy fast food burger of a blockbuster, even if it's still a burger","To convey what I think of Top Gun: Maverick properly, I'll make an analogy that will take a moment. I'm not sure if anyone has heard of the Mythical Kitchen, which is an off-shoot of the YouTube series Good Mythical Morning with Rhett and Link, but Josh from the Mythical Kitchen is quite the craftsperson when it comes to making the most gourmet fast food you've never thought about. Some examples include a ""$249 Wagyu Beef Panda Roll from Panda Express"" or ""569 Wetzel Pretzel Taste Test"" or the most recent video, ""Josh Makes a Six Foot Taco."" Josh can take a ton of ingredients, some I've never heard of and don't know what I would do with, and makes something that is absolutely spectacular looking and, of course, quite expensive - but the idea is that it's much, much more tasty and less like the school cafeteria taste you might get from your garden variety Burger King or KFC or what have you. This is all to say Top Gun: Maverick is a Josh Mythical Kitchen special where you can tell this has been made with intense, high-quality care.... does it transcend being fast food? Your mileage and/or colon may vary.",
230,27 August 2022,Caribtony,8, Great entertainment!,"FINALLY got around to watching Top Gun: Maverick today. I was a bit apprehensive despite the high ratings and rave reviews, only because the movie is over two hours long. Still, curiosity got the better of me. The film was beautifully shot with great cinematography of not only the flight scenes, but also the landscape and terrain those scenes occurred. I felt the first 45 minutes was a bit heavy on the corny and nostalgic side, and I had a hard time relating to the heteronormative of naval camaraderie, as well as the unabashed bravado of the pilots - men and women. However, the storyline is actually good (mission into enemy territory to destroy a uranium plant; which four pilots of the 10 candidates will be selected), and I feel this version separated itself from the first movie and found its own path in the last 45 minutes. Of course the ending paid tribute to the first Top Gun as a means to tie up the ribbon of nostalgia that threaded the entire experience. Overall I'll give it an 8 out of 10. It's not an Oscar contender, but it's still great entertainment!",

So fun to be back in the skies with Maverick and the new gang. Everybody did a really great job and the sequences in the jets were just heart stopping. Such a fun ride. My only wish was that we got to know the characters a bit more.. mainly the new ones. The movie was really tight.. and I think it could have used a bit more room to breathe in between the action scenes.. and with the characters so we got to know them a bit more.

In this remake movie, Maverick is back to Top gun as an instructor and leads few young pilots for a mission. In 2 years during covid pandemic, I watched many movies. And none of them was any good or deserve a 7-star. This movie is the first movie since the pandemic that is worth watching. It has a good storyline with some romance. It has very realistic plane dogfight scenes (which I dont think it is CGI) and hell yeah, a very good ending. The ending is not a copy of star wars. In fact, the ending in Top Gun 2 is much better.

Now, after nearly 10 years since the original director died by suicide and years of delays, Top Gun 2 finally is out for all the world to see. If you cried when goose died in the first one, you'll cry again as Iceman dies from throat cancer and cheer when Maverick falls in love with a new single mom played by Jennifer Connelly, who grew up watching the movie. Miles Teller plays Rooster, who is Goose's son, who helps Maverick steal a chinese plane at the end of the movie in order to succeed. Like the original, it pays homage to the past and moves towards the present. There is a volleyball like scene which is fun as well as a bar scene. Some of the plane scenes might be too intense for those who want to see it in imax, although i saw the 4k regular version instead. If you got cash to spend, then maverick is worth watching on the big screen as well as online!!!",
254,7 June 2022,AfricanBro,7, Haven't seen a movie like it in a while,"I'd been putting this on hold since it came out because I kept telling myself I need to watch the first one first but it wasn't happening so I just went into it blind, still enjoyed it. My first thoughts was about fixing the plane; why do mechanics, car or plane, often work with white t-shirts or vests on and always get them stained with oil, it's not a top gun thing but it's the first time I've noticed it. Anyway, the movie itself is great, was expecting a decent film but it's better than that, it's like a good old blockbuster, it's really just an action movie; I was concerned at first because in recent years most movies have had to have comedy element added to it but top gun sticks to being just top gun and I like that. Goes without saying that Tom cruise is much older now but he proves he still has it in him, the opening act was so blood pumping and it's the exact feeling I assume the first movie had.",
255,25 September 2022,ImFast28,10, 36 years was worth the wait!!!!,"The absolute BEST movie I have seen since the original. I grew up here in San Diego and lived in the era an stood on the deck of the ""Top Gun"" house and witnessed the orginal Top Gun logo at Miramar Air base growing up. The original hit home in so many ways and has been a family staple.",

Throughout the whole film I constantly thought ""That's a good movie. Haven't seen such a good movie in the last years."" That doesn't mean this movie is so great, it just means that movies nowadays are extremely bad. Top Gun: Maverick was a bit cheesy, but it had some good dialouges, a good plot, characters that were enjoyable to watch - that's a lot nowadays. The action was mind blowing, and despite me not really liking Tom Cruise I always enjoy his movies. He picks them well, and he is a good actor. I cried a lot, because it was so emotional. Then I laughed. It was a bitter laugh. Because I wondered how that story would go if it was told from the other side, you know, from the enemy side. Those heroes have to kill other people at the end of the day. And who knows who is bad and good? But that's the tragedy of human existence. Overall this was a very emotional, entertaining and smart movie.",
257,8 June 2022,TC-Batsy,10, The Best Blockbuster in Years,"I've seen Top Gun: Maverick three times since its release and can't get enough of this epic sequel that pays homage to the 1986 classic with superstar Tom Cruise in the lead. The movie is filmed in IMAX cameras, which gives fans the most exciting movie experience as they find themselves in the cockpits of those powerful F-18 Super Hornets and with zero CGI. The storyline is perfectly written and we witness Captain Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell who lives on the edge as a test pilot and refuses to retire until he's given orders by the Navy to train new pilots, including Goose's son for a clandestine mission. Once again, Tom Cruise proves that he's a versatile actor, who gives 100% in every film while perfecting his stunts and even flying his own plane. Jennifer Connelly and Miles Teller are brilliant in their roles respectively. Top Gun: Maverick is the Summer's best blockbuster and it's the movie we've been waiting for.",
258,27 May 2022,colewaters,10, The best Sequel in years,"Top Gun is one of those movies that was really good, but Top Gun Maverick is one of those sequels that is better then the original.

Yes he will disobey orders and be insubordinate but get away with it because the Admiral (a shell of his former self) will cover for him. Yes he will have a fight with Rooster, conveniently, Goose's son who still blames Maverick for his father's death and holding back at the Academy. Yes he will prove that the ""impossible"" mission (sorry wrong series) can be done. Yes, he will be named Team Leader of this mission. Yes, he will choose Rooster as his wing man, etc, etc, etc. And oh by way, if the enemy has these so called ""Fifth Generation Fighters"" why would they have a museum piece like an F14 just sitting in a hanger, fully fueled and armed to the teeth?

The IMAX presentation for this was probably one of the best I have ever seen. Absolutely stunning as a popcorn action film and a fun return to the series that never gives up on the audience. I was extremely surprised, considering the age gap between the first film and this one, but somehow the cast and crew were able to pull it together and make it a memorable homage to the original and a new story worth telling. It also has some of the best practical effects I have seen in many years, and I applaude the filmmakers for using as little cgi as possible to bring those high flying action sequences to life!

The story was really good (aside from just a couple of scenes that weren't really needed in my opinion, like the bar scenes and the scene where Bradley and Maverick meet up in the forest after they both get shot down), the cinematography and action were flawless and filled with risky sequences, the performances were done well, and the real actual fighter jet flying that all of the main crew had to do was impressive to say the least! This movie is much more memorable and higher quality than the first movie yet the movie had some good 80s feeling to it as well!

So bored of the bar machismo and stereotypical character - Jon Hamm being particularly awful. You know how the whole movie will pan out. In fact the movie could just be a video game with loads of cut scenes plugged in. Some serious plane hardware on display which means I can give it 5 stars. However the whole mission just seemed to be a Star Wars rip off - trench, tiny target, fly casual. As with Avengers no feeling that anything bad is going to happen to anyone so you just have to sit back with plenty of beer and let it wash over you.

269,31 January 2023,Sees All,7, Classic Hollywood Entertainment,"I had no interest in seeing this movie (I'm usually more of an art film fan) until it was nominated for Oscars in several important categories. And it's playing in my neighborhood, so I decided to check it out. Boy was I surprised! TOP GUN MAVERICK is the kind of movie Hollywood is famous for: glamorous people doing exciting things while giving the audience thrills and chills and suspense with an upbeat ending. Hollywood has been in love with aviation from the very beginning. The very first Oscar for best picture was WINGS, about pilots in World War I. Audiences were thrilled by its daring arial photography. With the technological advances of 95 years, the arial sequences of TOP GUN MAVERICK are even more exciting. The story is one that has seen many incarnations over the years: the old timer is called back to action in order to teach the young people how to do it. But has he lost his chops? Will he win the trust of both his superiors who are almost hoping for him to fail, and the young people who consider him a bitter has-been. Yeah, we've probably seen it before, but never as spectacularly thrilling. It's also a movie that the whole family can enjoy. The movie has been a record-breaking box-office success worldwide and it's easy to see why. It's nothing terribly profound, but extremely entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",

Is it expected that as fickle as movie goers are; Top Gun:Maverick is to be gushed over as a blockbuster or be treated as a pretty good follow up. I expected more than a mediocre rehash of hunks of the most liked scenes in the original.

Hats off to the actors who trained for months to be able to sit in front of cameras in the back of proper F-18's at incredible g-force. The continuity in plot was nostalgic enough to please fans of the original, yet with enough depth to thrill those new to Top Gun.

The technical side of the cinematography, especially the onboards from the jests was mesmerizing - you just felt the same G-forces as the pilots - and that is an achievment on it's own. The other big selling point of Maverick is the functional work with nostalgic aspects of the story, and the evergreen soundrack, that teleports you to the golden 80's and 90's. Maverick is a movie package, that is not happening very often, so it was nice to have the urge to visit the cinemas on multiple occasions, just to feel the effects of this masterpiece again and again, on the big silver.

Its a clean advertisement for lockheed martin and the military aircraft industry.

The sexualised relationship in the first movie is toned down and replaced with family values and also hints of homo erotism between the male characters. The enemys are never shown as in the first movie, you never see their faces, its just briefly mentioned, that this is a nato operation against a nuclear plant - you could also argue that this is an aggressive act of war, not covered by the UN. But politics are not discussed, the military is just a tool - and the heros just work for the hegemonic position of the usa and dont bother committing a war crime.

THAT nostalgia is what makes this sequel so much fun. We've been waiting a very long time, and they definitely delivered. It's as action packed as the 1st one, they didn't stray from the original music, and the cheesy factor is all there.

Half of the movie is stupid internal conflicts and a love story with a bad bad actress. The other half is similar but worse than the original Top Gun training movie. I can't believe they re-included the beach volleyball scene. One could seriously edit down this movie to 45-50min and make it snappy to keep the audience hooked.,

334,12 November 2022,Jonathanb-97,9, Tom Cruise at his best!,To be honest I am not a big Tom Cruise Fan at all but when I saw the first Top Gun Movie I was like ok this is a good movie not great but good. So I saw the trailer for Top Gun Maverick and it actually looked really good and after watching it in theatres twice I think you can tell I liked it. It was a very good movie with lots of action and some humour and lots of scenes that will make you happy but also emotional. I thought they did a lot of call backs from the first movie and brought back some characters too. My only criticism is that in both movies they don't say who they are fighting which is kind of disappointing but I think they should just stop it at these two movies and not make a third as this one was a long waited movie in the making and does not need a third one even though I loved it. 9/10.,

It had all of the adrenaline, machismo, and simplicity of the first movie, but with all the flashiness that new movies have to offer. Every time a character takes flight the audience flies with them and it will put you on the edge of your seat! The movies starts off a bit cheesy, but hits full speed once we return to Top Gun. Miles Teller does a great job as Rooster and Tom Cruise steps seemlessly back into the role of Maverick. There are plenty of look backs at the original movie, but the new crew feels fresh and new.

Before I explain, I wasn't fond of the original ""Top Gun"" at all simply because I didn't get to feel the need or see it through the gay way. Mainly I didn't get the chance to grow up with the 80s or be a massive fan of the 80s stuff as many others did. However, due to the positive word of mouth, I wanted to give it a chance because I like to give movies chances and I am open to surprises. Here's my takeaway:It's definitely not a bad film, that's for sure. It also ain't no cinematic masterpiece or something that is considered cinema.

Top Gun Maverick takes everything from the original and times it by 10. The movie did a great job of not overdoing ""Easter eggs"" from the original Top Gun.

372,26 June 2022,Zi_Reviews_Movies,9, Cinema at its finest.,"This movie is why people will continue to watch in cinemas over streaming subscriptions at home. This is my first Tom Cruise movie in a theatre and the only one I've watched from start to end in one sitting. Now it's not because I don't like the Scientologist, but because Action isn't my genre as much. I'll be honest, I had a long day and was pretty tired by when the movie started, things were slow, I hadn't watched or heard of the original Top Gun, hence had zero context, and 15 mins into the movie thought this was going to be a 2-hour long snooze fest. Boy was I wrong. Once the plot was laid and homage was paid to the original, the movie just kept climbing up the roller coaster, hitting a new peak every time. I now have a burning desire to be in a fighter jet or frankly any kind of combat aircraft. (May the Lord grant me this wish.)
Every time a jet came on the screen, the director had me on the edge of my seat. It felt real, I felt entirely invested in the movie and time just flew by. It felt so real that I can't even say what was CGI and what wasn't, to me, who knows zero facts about this movie, I'm going to believe Tom Cruise and the rest are trained pilots. The supporting cast did a fantastic job too. The movie made me feel patriotic and proud and oh, it made me swoon over Tom Cruise. The old man hasn't lost his charm since Jerry Maguire. It was also exciting to see new kinds of action scenes over the car chases, fight scenes, and random missile combat scenes most movies serve.",

374,5 March 2023,Uriah43,7, A Good Sequel to an Outstanding Action Film,"This film essentially begins with Navy aviator ""Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell"" (Tom Cruise) now working as a test pilot on a project designed to evaluate the capability of a protype jet designed to travel at Mach 9. Problems occur, however, when a senior Navy officer named ""Rear Admiral Chester 'Hammer' Cain"" (Ed Harris) lets it be known that, unless the prototype aircraft can reach a speed of Mach 10, he plans on cancelling everything in favor of drones. Not only that, but it is also learned that he will be arriving at the test site very soon to make the announcement in person. To that effect, rather than allowing the project to be terminated, Maverick makes boards the protype with the stated intention of flying it at Mach 10-regardless of whether the airplane can handle the stress or not. Sure enough, he achieves his goal but, as is often the case, he recklessly tries to gather even more speed-which results in total engine failure and him having to eject in the middle of the Mojave Desert. Infuriated by all of this, Rear Admiral Cain considers ending Captain Mitchell's career but is prevented from doing so when orders come through transferring Maverick to the Top Gun school for a special assignment. When he gets there, however, he is disappointed to learn that, rather than being designated to fly on this top-secret assignment, he has been detailed to train several younger pilots instead. Not only that, but one of the pilots by the name of ""Lieutenant Bradley 'Rooster' Bradshaw"" (Miles Teller) has been nursing a personal grudge against Maverick for some time and, in the course of the training, it spills over for all to see. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this turned out to be a pretty good sequel due in large part to the excellent action scenes and a solid performance by Tom Cruise in the lead role. Admittedly, I would have preferred a bit more personal chemistry between Tom Cruise and Jennifer Connelly (as ""Penny Benjamin"") who has proven herself quite capable of handling a role in that regard. Likewise, the ending could have used a bit more realism as well. Be that as it may, while I don't consider this film to be quite as good as its predecessor, it was still entertaining in its own right, and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",

You will spend a couple of hours watching him show us what a hero he is, riding a motorcycle real fast, control a jet fighter that also goes very fast, smile a whole bunch, have women smile at him. The plot is immature with all the typical macho garbage you would expect from an American military movie with Tom Cruise in it.",

388,11 February 2023,gbill-74877,6," Great aerial scenes, not a great movie","Entertaining for its stunning aerial scenes, but this is too much of a big Hollywood production for my taste, and it's problematic besides. I wish there had been some sense of realism, but this is escapist fantasy, and felt at times like a Tom Cruise vanity project. It was nice seeing his character, Maverick, as an old-timer, facing the days when drones may replace his kind, and being mocked (initially) by the young hot shots. The nearly impossible mission he is meant to train them for looks a little like a trip to blow up the Death Star and it's as contrived as hell, but it's suitably thrilling. Why not just use a drone strike or those tomahawk missiles that can clearly reach the target though? Aside from those kinds of issues, the film is predictable and cheesy as a whole, and in the subplots involving his old buddy's son (Miles Teller) and a love interest (Jennifer Connelly). The twelve pilots recruited for the mission check all kinds of diversity boxes, but none of the characters is developed in a meaningful way.",

395,28 August 2022,Raydio,6," Entertaining flight scenes, but little else","I had high expectations for ""Top Gun Maverick"", considering the hype and an IMDB rating of 8.5. But it became all too apparent within the first few minutes of the opening scenes, that this ""new"" film was basically a rehash of the original Top Gun, with updated aircraft and a lot more focus on Tom Cruise. The dialogue was mostly average, and often cringeworthy, and very cliched. But it's not all bad news either. The fighter jet scenes are nothing short of exhilarating, and you can see that a lot of effort went into filming them. Sound effects of the jets in action add to the immersive experience of this film. All in all though, I came away with the sense that I'd pretty much seen it all before (I just re-watched the original with my daughter before watching the new film), and the outcome was ever so predictable. I have no idea why this film is currently rated as the 58th greatest movie of all time. That's an insult to some truly exceptional films which are ranked well below this one. For a film to be ranked in the Top100 of all time I think it needs to be more than a mere 2-hour entertaining diversion, it really needs a solid script, engaging characters, and a story that that we might still be thinking about long after the hype dies down.",

Following an incident where Maverick takes a prototype jet passed the limit, Maverick seems poised for a discharge however thanks to the intervention of Maverick's former wingman Tom ""Iceman"" Kazansky (Val Kilmer), Maverick is instead transferred back to TOPGUN to train a batch of 12 pilots for a mission to destroy a uranium enrichment facility in a hostile nation-state before it can be activated in three weeks' time. Of 12 fighter pilots, Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw (Miles Teller) has a history with Maverick as Rooster still carries animosity towards Maverick over the loss of his father and Maverick's wingman Goose and the fact Maverick pulled Rooster's academy papers and derailing his career. During this time Maverick also rekindles his romance with an old flame in Penny (Jennifer Connelly)",

The epic score of Top Gun (1988) just adds to the greatness of the movie. You wouldn't regret going to the theatre to see this blockbuster, your time will get passed in a jiffy.

It's also amazing how the team managed to transport the vibe of the first instalment to this second iteration without making it feel dated. I just really wish, that directors and producers will pick up on this success story and apply this winning formula onto modern-day topics as well. As the movie pointed it out: You have to let go. But the basic principle of heroes actually succeeding without annoying the audience with ""the dark side of the character"" is a winning principle, that will hopefully be applied to many other topics as well - not just action movies.",

It had a wonderful cast...Val Kilmer (my crush at the time), Tom Skerritt, Meg Ryan, Anthony Edwards, Kellie McGillis, Tim Robbins, and it really launched Tom Cruise's career. The film also had a fantastic soundtrack that was lead by Berlin's ""Take my Breath Away""and Kenny Loggins' ""Danger Zone"".

The story worked with a an older, somewhat wiser Maverick getting sent back to Top Gun school to train others to take out an UNKNOWN ENEMY'S (but we know it's Russia) Uranium cracking plant. This avoids some of the silly plot tropes usually in these movies, but the ending, when Maverick and Rooster are shot down, walk onto an enemy base and steal an old F-14, is just silly. He also shoots down two fifth generation enemy fighters in this old, retired plane. Why did the enemy have one? Because: Plot. But it was fun.

After reading a little bit about the behind the scenes of this movie, some of it had to do with Tom Cruise's dissatisfaction of how the original Top Gun was shot. I walked into the theatre hoping for some eye-popping and thrilling stunt sequences and Maverick certainly delivered on that front. The action was breathtaking to see on the theatre screen, leave it to Cruise and his team to bring some juice to the acrobatics to help re-invigorate the franchise for modern audiences. I can't speak to the technical specifications or how much of the movie is accurate to real life but nothing felt outlandish enough to shatter the illusion of the movie. The dogfighting and aerial manoeuvring will have you dipping and dodging in your seat and Top Gun: Maverick and even if you're not familiar with the previous film, it will keep you engaged while you get to know the characters.",

Arguably the best movie I've ever seen on the big screen and one of the best movies I've seen in a while period. In what I think is Tom Cruise's best movie, he shows how much he's matured as an actor and how far he'll go to bring the audience a realistic movie void of any over the top cgi which seems to plague so many modern movies today. I'll admit I didn't want to see it a second time even though I really liked it the first go around, I did it because my Mom wanted to watch it again and so I went with her and my Dad. As I said before I loved this movie, not only the great, realistic plane sequences, but the story and the characters, every single one of them. I think this is the movie that finally cements Tom Cruise as not only one of the greatest action stars of all time, but the best in my opinion. Top Gun: Maverick reminds me of one simple fact.

Plot is questionable but the action is edge of the seat stuff, the opening scene and the test course is hair raising. Cruise makes it happen, even after all these decades he is spectacular. There's a few telling quotes in there about time running out, but fortunately for us it was indeed, not today. Appreciate this once in a generation actor while you can and feel the need for speed.",

The football scene too * chefs kiss *,
459,6 August 2022,sarah_louise_broadhead,10, The best film I have ever seen,This is awful and cheesy. From the off where they show the mission straight away it felt like someone had taken the 1977 Star Wars mission and made it with fighter jets. As the movie progressed it became even more like the original Star Wars movie but with lots of Cheese between Tommy Cruiser and Jenny Connolly. It got boring and i switched the movie off after about an hour or so.,

This movie combined all the greatness from the original but ramped up to current times with more action and so much suspense. The flight scenes with Tom Cruise and all the actors are completely stunning and because they are real they grab you and pull you in. It's been a while since I watched a movie and literally was on the edge of the my couch, shaking my leg and cringing. A lot of people don't like Tom Cruise due to what is reported about his personal life, but I always enjoy his films and I think he is an incredible actor. He does almost all his own stunts and it really adds to the movies and makes them more engrossing. This is one of the best movies I've watched this year!!",

I was expecting less and instead got more, a very pleasant experience. It covered all the bases a movie should include and what is outstanding is it is a decent script acted out reasonably well. It is not a movie I would see twice but rewarding the first time around as there are no memorable scenes. Also, it is one of those flicks where the ending ends it for good! Worth the price of admission and the time to view. Good job to all involved. To Tom Cruise: Keep up the good work. Forget Hollywood! Give me entertainment!

It includes the old heroes and some of their family members, but in a realistic historic way. Maverick is still Maverick and he will do ""whatever it takes"" and a true hero we can all root for.

The movie is extremely well done and the lengths that Cruise, et.al. Went to to insure authenticity shows. My only real authenticity complaint is the initial scene where Maverick ejects from his hypersonic plane as it begins to disintegrate at Mach 10.5. Any person who ejects at that sped would immediately crushed by the force of the wind (even thin atmosphere) slamming against his body. Maverick would have been dead right there.

Hadn't even seen a trailer until the reviews were claiming it was a masterpiece, so I decided to check it out. Predictable plot, no stakes, CHEESIEST dialogue you ever heard, piss poor character development, boring plot, etc. This movie is such a waste of time. Was rolling my eyes at Tom Cruise's cheesiness. And Jennifer Connelly's character was so embarrassingly cringe. Also why was the edgy Air Force guy smiling throughout every single line of his. Again, the best way I'd describe this movie is cheesy. What a ridiculous movie.",

Top Gun: Maverick is an outstanding movie sequel which respects the first part and is also a standalone in a kind (yes, you can watch the movie without watching the first movie, but do catch the first one later which is equally good). The stunt sequence can be tricky for some but can be understood if it is carefully followed. I will one day watch this movie with my son as one the best movie of my time.

It left me feeling emotional and melancholy for the life I was leading in 1986, it was a different world that saw the original as a fun, adrenaline rush like none we had seen. The harshness of the world meant this movie was going to be darker. And it is. However. It was a far superior movie to the first Tom has aged with grace and has an attention to detail that I appreciate as a movie goer. Yes, there are references to the first movie, but because it needed to show that while everything changes, nothing really changes at all. No spoilers here. Just a huge TC fan who has seen it twice on opening weekend and will go for a third before it leaves the theaters.

Must watch on big screen.,
498,10 June 2022,CinematicSyndrome,9, What a spectacular movie,I'll admit I'm not a huge fan of the original Top Gun. I thought the cheesy story and feel good atmosphere just doesn't age well into today. So i inaccurately assumed that the sequel would just carry that over. I went to the theatre mostly for the Jet action sequences. What I got however was a movie that had a well-written story with emotion that I wasn't expecting. This was a pleasant surprise and I strongly encourage everyone to go see it.,
499,28 May 2022,ratpackaustin,9, Just. Wow.,Some of the dialogue in the air was corny but all the flight and combat scenes made up for that. Very entertaining. Tom Cruise still has it. Respect to pilots that actually fly these supersonic jets.,

This is the norm, before 19.00 here. The story started off with some slow moments, kicked into gear & delivered in punches. I enjoyed the original, a lot and it's one of the films of the 80s my friends & I loved and quoted, often. But as it got older the story was okay, a little introductory, laced with sadness. This one has a more intricate & interesting story with a cracking cast, like the first one. There is some antagonism with bravado & stunning cinematography. There was a dip in the story in the middle, maybe late in the film but it unfolds quickly as to why. This is a must see in the Cinema. Miss it at your own peril !!",

The same goes for its decade-defining soundtrack, with 'Take My Breath Away' and 'Danger Zone' and the Harold Faltermeyer theme tune.

Growing up in the eighties I got to say that I was still a boy when the first movie came out and it is not an exaggeration to say that it inspired an entire generation. The need for speed was in the mind of every young person when Top Gun first came out. The first movie probably encouraged many youngsters to become pilots themselves or at least fantasize being one. However, this movie did not have the magic or lustre of the first movie. This felt like a rip-off of Star Wars. A bunch of pilots have to get these missiles in a very tight hole by using the Force. The entire mission, although impressive, is needlessly complicated. All the Navy needed to do was to launch a bunch of missiles from high sea and call it a day... or launch a few drones.",
535,10 January 2023,phoenixinvictus,7, Good but not great,"Just when it seemed like it had rendered itself completely irrelevant with its obsessing over superhero franchises and remakes, Hollywood threw out this lifeline to the fast diminishing population of adult moviegoers. And it was immediately rewarded with incredible box-office numbers. Unlike so many films in the action/adventure genre of recent, Top Gun: Maverick is a proper movie - traditional escapism for long-time movie buffs - which is as enjoyable to see as it is a relief. Granted, we are talking about a sequel here, but it's a sequel that stands firmly, independently and confidently on its own feet as an apolitical, unironic, straightforward movie made with aesthetics and thrills in mind. And one of the reasons the action works so well is that it feels organic. CGI is used as a tool, not as a foundation, which makes a world of difference for how the flying action looks. From the minute Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell is reintroduced, and once all the nostalgia has quieted down, Top Gun: Maverick gets into its slick, well laid out setup of fighter jet training, an exhilarating real-life mission, and only a semi-vapid romance between Maverick and Penny, played with a perpetual pose by Jennifer Connelly. Tom Cruise, on the other hand, looks amazing and gives one of the most compelling performances of his career. When Maverick is told by his old pal Iceman that ""it's time to let go"" and Cruise replies ""I don't know how"", the actor looks to be tapping into more real emotion than he has ever done before. I, for one, believe that Cruise might not know how to let go, but luckily he has no need to just yet.",

537,2 June 2022,adamthompson-87217,10, OH MY DAYS!,Doing a legacy sequel to a cult classic 36 years later can be a risky thing to pull off. Doing so could prove to be a highway to the danger zone.,
538,21 June 2022,JayWolfgramm,8, Took my Breath Away,"I just walked out of seeing Top Gun: Maverick, and this movie... is AMAZING! This might be one of the sequels ever made. The visuals, the story, the characters, everything about this movie is a plus! THERE ARE NO NEGATIVES! It does everything right, while being an amazing, airplane pilot story! Tom Cruise gives it his all in the movie, and you can see that being expressed! Maverick is a compelling character with motivations and character development, and it's a perfection arc. The film does a very well job at pacing its story, and not rushing anything while being hella entertaining!",
539,23 May 2022,harcool,9, Just walked out of Top Gun: Maverick,"The original 'Top Gun', released in 1986, has become a cheesy, incredibly entertaining classic, and it isn't hard to see why. The new film is better than the original, but still arrives with some flaws. As with the original, the film loses speed on the ground, but when it's in the air, it is absolutely fantastic.",

541,29 September 2022,prestindalling,9, Surprisingly Much Better Than the First One,"This could have been so bad. Too much nostalgia, to much CGI, a woke overhaul. Tom Cruise reprising a role he did 30 odd years ago, no way could he pull that off. Honestly this has doomed money maker written all over it. Well, from the moment that bell rings and you are launched into Highway To The Danger Zone theme I was hooked. The nostalgic nods are spot on . The flying, no CGI here, move on, just seat of your pants jet rides. The woke brigade have been kept at arms length and Tom Cruise, is probably the only actor who could get away with reprising a role so long ago and be so utterly convincing. One of the few movies I could have turned round at the end and watched all over again. Top Marks .",
542,30 May 2022,chrisforeman-01920,10, So easy to cock this up.,"The movie was an overall joy to watch. It was well shot, well produced, and well written. The story line seems to what to pay tribute to the original and leave ties to its roots. The movie had a Michael Bay movie feel towards the end that seemed the intense action seems to out weigh a quality script and a couple times got an almost predictable turn. I do think that that is forgotten due to the first 75% of the movie being well written and a quality ground work laid that leads in to it. This is a great choice for a movie if you are wanting to have a fun movie night that with get the ole heart pumping.",
