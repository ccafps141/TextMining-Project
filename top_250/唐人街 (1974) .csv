1,10 September 2004,nycritic,10, Capturing the True Spirit of Film-noir,"The seventies were the last years of great (American) films. I say films because when we speak of movies nowadays, we allude to blockbusters that generate hundreds of millions of dollars, the least amount of controversy, and are mostly inane crowd pleasers with tacked-on endings.",r
2,30 January 2002,rmax304823,10, Marvelous,"There is a word, impossible to spell, that describes the alignment of solar bodies like the planets when they all fall into place together. A similar word would describe this film. Everything about it is right. Polanski never directed a better movie. The performers, down to the lowest atmosphere person, are superb. The editing, the score, the sound, the decor, the dialog, all are just about flawless. The photography is peerless. The white garden apartments, the terra cotta roof tiles, the palms and desert sand are all painted with a faint gold, faintly ripe with false promise, like the oranges that bounce from Gittes' desperately speeding car in the northwest Valley.

3,15 November 2018,Tweekums,10, Great 'modern' film noir,"Set in late '30s Los Angeles this 1974 film opens with a woman, identifying herself as Evelyn Mulwray, asking private detective Jake Gettes to find out whether her husband, chief engineer of the LA Water and Power Company, is having an affair. He follows him and ultimately photographs him with another woman. Somehow these pictures end up in the papers and he is approached by another woman who it turns out is the real wife of Mulwray... and she intends to sue. He continues to investigate Mulwray and suspects some odd goings on at Water and Power... then Mulwray turns up dead; drowned during a severe drought. His continued investigation brings him closer to the real Evelyn as well as into real danger as he learns the truth about Water and Power's activities which could make some people very rich at the expense of other, poorer, people.",v
4,17 December 2003,Quinoa1984,10, As coolly intense and exceptionally-staged as any detective story/film-noir of the 40's & 50's,"Chinatown is a tremendous collaborative effort that produced one of the most memorable Hollywood pictures of the 1970's. Director Roman Polanski (his last film in America, and the first he made in America after the murder of Sharon Tate), stars Jack Nicholson & Faye Dunaway, and writer Robert Towne, all come together to create a detective story classic. At times it slows its pace down so the viewer can think along with Nicholson's character, to take in the environment as well as the situation he's in (i.e. when he goes to the empty reservoir, when he visits Noah Crosses house the first time). And the script has the perfect sense of drawing us into a story, fueled by curiosity, grit, and cynicism, and engages the viewer by its realistic dialog between the characters.",i
5,26 August 2017,stroggos,10, This movie got it all: perfectly paced study of human darkness,"I knew CHINATOWN was hailed as the paragon of a film noir, and that's why I finally got down to watching it. However, despite having known about the movie for quite a while, I wasn't really prepared for just how dark it could be. The movie starts slowly, with a private detective taking on what looks like a routine case. But soon he finds himself enmeshed in a web of conspiracy, murder, lies and deceit. The plot is like a perfect machine that relentlessly moves towards a final resolution that is truly epic and truly soul-wrenching.",e
6,19 January 2019,Instant_Palmer,10, Polanski & Nicholson's Finest Work. A Top 20 Greatest Film 💯,"Chinatown sits securely at the pinnacle of the Neo Noir genre. Fueled by Polanski-Nicholson synergy, anchored by one of greatest-ever original screenplays (written by Los Angeles native Robert Towne), brought to movie-life via PanaVision by brilliant cinematographer John Alonzo, and produced by the industry icon Robert Evans, this is one of film's greatest works of art, and being imo one of the top 20 greatest films ever made - it is a must-see movie.",w
7,23 December 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10," A noir masterpiece, possibly even a timeless classic...","While I don't care too much for Roman Polanski's style of direction(maybe I'll grow to like it eventually, maybe not), I can't deny that this is a truly great film. Jack Nicholson really shines through in his role, and his acting in this film perfectly fits the character... his shark smile, his voice, his tone... all of it, perfect. I always thought, when watching films with Nicholson, that he'd make a great lead in a noir film, so when I found this film and discovered that it was indeed noir, I naturally saw it as soon as possible. I found the film to have a slightly slower pace than what I would have preferred or expected, but apart from that minor detail, it was flawless. The plot is great, and thoroughly interesting and involving. The pacing, while not fast all the time, is more than acceptable. There are sequences that are really intense and exciting. The acting is great... like I said earlier, Nicholson shines through and really takes this character and makes him his own. The characters are well-written and credible. The special effects are well-done and still hold up pretty well. The dialog is very well-written and memorable. There are quite a few quotable lines, as well. The cinematography is good, and even when the plot doesn't move a lot, Polanski keeps our interest through interesting angles and sequences. I liked that there was often something subtle going on in the background, while we're focusing on what's directly in front of us. While Polanski certainly doesn't possess the attention to detail that Kubrick does, he manages to put a good bit of detail into many of the shots, and there is fairly little left to coincidence or chance, much like Kubrick. The film has a few twists that are quite good, and they come as surprises... I don't think I really saw them coming, and I doubt anyone would be able to. Of course, some might not find the twists to be that impressive, but the story stands on it's own nicely as well. This is a great movie, which should be seen by just about anyone who can take it(it's more than just casually adult in nature, even though there's not that much violence or sex in it). I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys film noir, watching Jack Nicholson in perfect shape in a role that was tailor-made for him, a good mystery, Roman Polanski's direction and just a good movie with a more adult tone that many others. 10/10",/
8,20 March 2006,Hitchcoc,10," Forget It Jake, It's Chinatown","This is a top ten for me. I have watched this film several times, and each time I see why Jack Nicholson is one of our great American actors. It starts with a story of complexity but accessibility. Nicholson's Jake Gittes, running around with a slit in the side of his nose, put there by Polanski, investigates, gets careless, and realizes what he has stumbled upon. Fay Dunaway as Mrs. Mulray and John Huston and that voice: ""Just find the girl."" There are comic scenes and Nicholson has feet of clay, but he finally puts his personal integrity on the line. He moves into darkness and sees the underside. And then there is Chinatown with its secrets, politics, incest, all of that. It is such an intelligent movies. One of the reviewers said it was compact. That says it all. Every scene is necessary. It's too bad Polanski can't work in the U.S. anymore--he still releases a treasures every so often. To get back to the movie, all that leads to the climactic last several minutes has been prepared for with loving care by the director. It's so nice to know that there are films like this that people will watch into the latter stages of the 21st century. One of finest.",r
9,18 October 2017,gab-14712,9, Example of Masterful Film Noir!,"Over the years, people have called Chinatown one of the best movies ever. I don't quite agree with that statement, but there is no denying that the movie is a masterpiece. I may not find it one of the best films all-time, but I do find it as one of the best films of 1974. This noir film hearkens back to the days where similar films were produced left and right. But starting from the 1960's, this genre slowly began to fade away. The film may come across as really taking its time to tell the story, but the thriller has lots of tension that builds up to its climatic ending. This film brought public awareness to some issues people may not have really known about. Water is a commodity for human survival and whoever controls the water, controls the money. This movie is a complex series of events surrounding the control of water and that people can die over this issue. Ah, the wonders of being a human being! The movie is a complicated follow, so don't lose yourself in any train of thought, or you might lose what will happen plot-wise. Boasting one of cinema's all-time greatest screenplays by Robert Towne and a powerful lead performance by Jack Nicholson, you are in for a fantastic time.",w

11,28 May 2005,RanchoTuVu,9, watered down noire,"A film about LA and water set in the l930's during a drought with a dark incestuous subplot and some stunning performances by Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson, and superb cinematography that seemed to capture the essence of LA. Directed by Roman Polanski, who makes a terrific cameo appearance as a switchblade wielding heavy, and using the considerable acting talents of John Huston as a ruthless and perverted landowner. Read Cadillac Desert to know about LA's water grab but see Chinatown for its brilliant allegory of water and corruption, both public and private. The direction, the screenplay, the acting, the photography, and the soundtrack combine to make a convincing and atmospheric picture. The crushing ending is just so much more icing on the cake.",3

Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is hired by a woman called Evelyn Mulwray to follow her husband Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling) to know if he is having an affair. Hollis is the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Chief Engineer, who is refusing to create a new water reservoir that he considers unsafe. Soon Gittes sees Hollis with a girl and photographs them. Then he follows Hollis, and he sees water being released from the reservoir during the night. On the next morning, his photos of Hollis are published on a newspaper but when he returns to his office, he meets the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) with her lawyer to sue him. Gittes realizes that he was deceived by someone that wanted to harm Hollis Mulwray, but soon he finds that the chief engineer was drowned in the reservoir. His further investigation shows that the water supply is disrupted to the local farmers and someone is buying the cheap lands to profit in the near future.",3
17,25 December 2008,Dr_Coulardeau,10," More multifariously tricky, you die.","This film is a masterpiece because it is nothing but what we expect and we expect something different at every single moment of it, so that we are disappointed and surprised and held breathless every fifteen minutes when one of our expectations goes down the chute. At first we think it is one more private eye's business or investigation in some kind of affair with some married man. But it does not fit at all with the professional dedication of the suspected unfaithful man. He is obviously looking for something fishy in the water supply of Los Angeles he is responsible for. But then he does meet with a girl, doesn't he after all. And yet there is something fishy in that water supply. So it might be a big embezzlement case. Let Los Angeles pay for the water they will never get and then let Los Angeles get to the water where it will be, and let them pay again. The point is it does not explain everything, and especially why the thieving contractor is so keen on getting the hooker his son in law was seeing. Too keen to be honest. Is she a hooker after all? And we go on doubting, hoping, being disappointed and never getting to the truth of the business. Who the killer really is? Who the police really work for? Who the police tries to protect and cover? Why do the police do that unprofessional act? There is just no good enough answer, and even at the end, when the tycoon contracting embezzler gets the last word we know we are off the point and losing all footing in too deep water. That's probably the best part of this film. You just have to accept the situation the way it is and do nothing just because some people are big enough, rich enough or powerful enough to do exactly what they want and everyone else has only one choice, die or say yes-sir-mister-master-sir-boss. Even killing his own child is not a no-go option for such a greedy person. Remember, change we can, but change these tycoons cannot. So better change them than expect them to change. Why not send them on a perpetual vacation in some desert island that has absolutely no connection with the outside world, But dummy, that's just the point, such a place does not exist. So better put them to death, put them to sleep or deep freeze them if you don't want to deep fry them, which stinks a little bit. But any other way will let them go on with their shaggy and dirty business. But gosh it reaps a lot of profit in. Look at Madoff.",/

I'll just say it took me several viewings to finally figure out what was going on. It's not an easy to story to follow. It's also unusual: a crime story dealing with rights to water. To many people, that's odd but water has always been a precious commodity in southern California.",?

21,2 May 2022,saikatsamanta,10, One of the Greatest Detective Thrillers of all time !!!,"Flawless films are hard to come by, so when I see one, the Cinephile Heart of mine gets filled with immeasureable pleasure. Now I realize how much this film inspired the terrific Video game I played 'LA Noire'. Every aspect of this neo noir Detective Thriller is a standout. A Private Investigator gets a mundane case of Extramarital affair which gradually steamrolls into a snake pit of Evil atrocities, with shocking revelations every 10 minutes, and a mindbogglingly grim ending that catapults this film in the midst of the Greatest Thrillers Ever made. Jerry Goldsmith's Iconic Music, Robert Towne's Exemplary Script, Polanski's genius ode to 40's noirs, Nicholson & Faye Dunway's terrific performances, this film is gold standard in every deparment. Every Film Lover has to have this in their To-Watch list.",f
22,24 March 2017,chaswe-28402,10, As perfect as possible,"It's difficult to imagine a more flawless movie than this. A youthful Jack Nicholson is at his very best and most plausible in the role of Jake Gittes, featuring in a continuously engaging story, which can be appreciated as a timelessly sophisticated tribute and homage to Chandler. Each scene and every moment of the swiftly evolving plot is redolent of intrigue and anticipation. Dunaway and Huston are also superbly cast, as are Burt Young, Diane Ladd, Perry Lopez, and the entire list. The acting and direction throughout are uniformly professional and superior. I was particularly struck by the old lady in the retirement home. The script is exceptional, and the dialogue totally polished and realistic. There are one or two lines which are directly evocative of Chandler at his best. ",_

38,1 February 2013,Red-Barracuda,10, Exceptional neo-noir masterpiece,"Chinatown can be interpreted in a number of ways. On the surface it's a compelling detective film, while it's also about the corrupt power of big business. It's also a damning indictment on the very origins of Los Angeles itself, where the city became a powerful entity on the back of the theft of water from the poor. Anyone with money is shown to be simply above the law. The central character, private investigator Jake Gittes, is ultimately shown to be utterly impotent when up against the water baron Noah Cross. The latter is at liberty to do exactly as he pleases, from large scale financial corruption to the ultimate personal transgression of incest. The story is a very pessimistic one indeed with Chinatown itself mainly referenced pointedly as a place where different rules apply, a place where anything goes and the law can do as they please. Gittes himself hints at an episode in his past where he tried to help a girl in Chinatown and it ended badly, the main narrative pans out tragically and history repeats itself. It's only at the end of the film where the action relocates to Chinatown itself and it is one of the most unforgettable, uncompromising and nihilistic in cinema history. Director Roman Polanski insisted on this bleak ending against the wishes of his screenwriter Robert Towne. Only a few years earlier Polanski's wife Sharon Tate had been murdered as the result of a house invasion by the Manson Family. Polanski, therefore, had an added level of cynicism about life in general because of this; he said 'That's life. Beautiful blondes die in Los Angeles. Sharon had.'",
39,16 April 2007,EThompsonUMD,10, L.A. as neo-Noir Wasteland,"Directed by Polish-born Roman Polanski, Chinatown (1974) is often credited with reviving the classic film noir detective/crime genre exemplified by such '40s and '50s American films as The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, and Touch of Evil. While classic film noir is characterized by low lit, black and white cinematography, Polanski managed to infuse Chinatown with a profound sense of corruption and nihilism while setting his tale amid the relentless blazing sunlight of a Southern California drought and despite employing two photographic elements previously thought antithetical to film noir style: color film stock and anamorphic widescreen composition. Chinatown's great critical and popular success demonstrated once and for all that the essence of film noir lay mainly in its bleak moral vision, not its cinematographic style.",

44,2 March 2007,moonspinner55,8," ""It's a flaw--in the iris...""","Seminal classic of '70s cinema, with Jack Nicholson excellent as a mostly-ethical former cop-turned-private detective in 1930s Los Angeles who believes he's been hired by the wife of the chief engineer of the Water and Power Department; she thinks her husband's cheating on her but, as it turns out, she's not the real Mrs. at all, and so propels Nicholson's Jake ""J.J."" Gittes into a tug-of-war between powerful ex-partners, with carnality and family secrets the key to unraveling the mystery. Oscar-winning screenplay by Robert Towne (who also penned the 1990 extension, ""The Two Jakes"") is filled with complicated story threads and characters with chequered pasts--lots of fun, though it is somewhat unfair the script is always two steps ahead of the audience (it would be nearly impossible for a first-time viewer to solve this case on his own; Towne sets up the game and ends up solving it for the rest of us). However, the picture is so deftly orchestrated by director Roman Polanski, one becomes engrossed in the proceedings even while being bombarded with both clues and extraneous matter. Faye Dunaway's performance, as the breathy, mysterious daughter of water-czar John Huston, walks a fine line between melodramatic and campy--still, she's entirely in the spirit of the piece, and an interesting screen-match for Nicholson. The film is assured and entertaining; it pulls the viewer in without giving out enough information concerning the milieu, though this lack of knowledge for our sake doesn't hurt the returns. A cannier, guessing-game approach to the plot may have made the film more commercial (it was a modest box-office hit); however, this presentation, messy though it may be, is still arresting. Repeat viewings are a must. *** from ****",

It's like this real, and metaphorical 'Chinatown' in every bigger town in the USA – a place where everything happens on its own rules.

While it is said to be a crime thriller meant to keep audiences on their toes with its action and drama, which is not really the effect that Chinatown has on the audience.

47,7 May 2014,PWNYCNY,10, There is no justice.,"Chinatown is an excellent movie. It earned eleven Academy Award nominations and is still discussed almost with reverence decades after its initial release. Such acclaim gives cause to comment on the person most popularly associated with creating the movie – the director, Roman Polanski. Polanski is a controversial figure. But then, the same can also be said for the character in Chinatown, Noah Cross. In the movie Cross, a sexual deviant and predator, and someone who is obviously troubled and disturbed, goes unpunished. That an injustice has occurred is undeniable. Even the hard-boiled detective in the movie who investigates Cross is shocked. The theme: there is no justice.",

49,6 April 2007,blanbrn,10," Pretty good crime detective film, with a hidden plot that has the viewer guessing. And one of the better and darker films of the 1970's.","""Chinatown"" is certainly one of the better films of the 1970's, though the plot is at first a little hidden causing the viewer to search for it. Only this ends up being a pretty dark and clever mystery. ""Chinatown"" is set in bright and sunny Los Angeles, California during the 1930's, and many scenes are memorable from the sets used like the houses, and the backdrop of the California skyline and desert. Jack Nicholson is Jake Gittes a veteran private eye who takes cases of people who believe that their significant other has cheated. Only one day he finds a funny thing is about to happen when he receives a report from a Mrs. Mulwray that her husband is cheating. Only later Gittes finds out that this wasn't the real Mrs. Mulwray! And soon upon investigating this claim, he learns that Mr. Mulwray is tied to a dispute over land and water in the L.A. valley, and as was so common in the 1970's this is tied to political corruption and civil servant scandal. More light is shed after Gittes finds the real Mrs. Mulwray(Faye Dunaway) and the discovery of Mr. Mulwray dead only deepens the mystery. Just when the plot seems to be clear the film throws the viewer off again showing that Mrs. Mulwray's father is playing a clear role in this torrid land and water mess as John Huston gives a fine performance as Noah Cross. Mostly ""Chinatown"" is a film of secrets, and political corruption with a plot that keeps the viewer guessing, certainly one of the better and darker films of the 1970's. Jack Nicholson is fantastic as always making this a classic because his performance was straight to the point, and Roman Polanski did a fine job directing this it was well adapted from Robert Towne, and one of the memorable scenes of all time is when Polanski's character cuts Jack's nose with a knife! Overall a pretty good detective mystery film.",

Gittes is swept into a web of double dealings, deceits, political scandals and murder, all leading to an unforgettable and powerful climatic in 'Chinatown.' Masterful direction by Polanski, with a captivating and intelligent Oscar winning original screenplay by Robert Towne, stunning cinematography by John A, Alonzo, and an evocative, dynamic score by the late great Jerry Goldsmith. This tour-de-force benefits greatly from the superlative supporting performances by Perry Lopez, John Hillerman, Diane Ladd, Darrell Zwerling, Burt Young, Bruce Glover, and James Hong. Special kudos must go to the late great director and character actor John Huston for his magnificent portrayal of the perverted and monstrously evil landowner Noah Cross. Roman Polanski makes a memorable cameo appearance as a short, sadistic switchblade wielding thug who savagely cuts Nicholson's nose.

This is an absolutely tremendous film, I loved nearly everything about it.

Because anyhow, Jack Nicholson as Jake Gittes is a gritty feature, he's experienced failure from back when he was a policeman in Chinatown, something that we only get through mysterious hints. Ad Jake's a well-dressed, humorous and classy man, but also cynical and impulsive and doesn't affect by walking around with a bandaged-nose most parts of the film. This is a hard-boiled detective-mystery which spins its complicated puzzle into something disturbingly dark, in which Faye Dunaway's terrific performance as the elegant Evelyn holds the movie's dark core as she acts like a classy femme fatale, with suspicious motives. CHINATOWN is one of those conspiracy-thrillers that demands a revisit, not only because its twirled plot is so intriguing, but because of Polanski creating a unforgettable, dark atmosphere of originals and one of Nicholson's greatest performances as he investigates his way down through greed, murder and incest.",

The great point that draws attention to ""chinatown"" is his script, he is completely magnificent, I would say, which is a complete synthesis of the perfection of how to script a movie, in 2 hours we have complete development of all the characters, we have a simple plot which gains layers of depth every minute, we have problems that mix with the city, turning into a political and social plot while bringing a classic story of a detective full of twists, who at one point surrenders to the cliché, but then surprises the all showing that in ""chinatown"" there are no spaces for the obvious. The film touches on such as love, police, ethics, society, organized crime, rape, nothing in a very deep way but also nothing is shallow, it gives the introduction to the theme, and the viewer who links the dots, alias, ""chinatown"" is a film that has to be seen and reviewed to be able to connect the points in a more satisfactory way, and to have a broad and complete notion of its history, which is not easy to understand in the first one visited during the film.

81,26 April 2007,planktonrules,8," A very nice, if imperfect, homage to Film Noir","While I know that CHINATOWN has a great reputation and has received many 10s from reviewers, as a fan of Film Noir, I saw a few minor problems that kept the score from being a bit higher--though it's still an exceptional film. First, as any devoted fan of Noir knows, Noir is always, and I repeat, always filmed in black and white. The great shadows and camera angles are an important trademark of the style. While this Roman Polanski film is beautifully filmed (with a lot of sepia tones) and it definitely has the look of a late 1930s Warner Brothers gangster film, it just isn't true Noir because it's in color! Second, and this is a problem shared by THE BIG SLEEP, is that the plot is very, very complicated--perhaps a bit too complicated--making the resolution of mysteries and complications a bit too simple. The end, in particular, just seemed too convoluted a solution and left a lot of loose ends. BUT, getting past these factors, the film is still exceptional. Jack Nicholson was terrific and so was the rest of the cast. And the film was definitely interesting and exciting. It's definitely one of the better films of the 1970s--but I just can't see this as a better film than many of the earlier Noir films, such as THE KILLERS, KISS OF DEATH or DOA.",

88,24 May 2020,a_chinn,10, A masterpiece of cinema dissects the detective film and America itself,"Produced during a time when revisionist films were en vogue, reworking familiar Hollywood genre pictures, westerns, gangster films, love stories, and here detective films, Roman Polanski and Robert Towne's ""Chinatown"" is a masterpiece of cinema that dissects not just the detective film but dissects America itself. Jack Nicholson plays private detective J.J. Gittes. When mysterious woman enters his office one day to hire him to look into a suspected affair by her husband, this small case, in classic Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett style, leads to a Byzantine mystery of murder, sex, money, power, and intrigue. Although this sounds familiar, this is a very different world from that of Chandler or Hammett. Gittes is not Phillip Marlowe or Sam Spade. He runs a successful P.I. business. Gittes himself is also the type of guy who will manically giggle at his own dirty jokes (can't picture Humphrey Bogart doing that). And befitting of 1970s cynicism, it's a story of the little guy facing down larger powers, though in this revisionist (i.e. more realistic) of world, the good guys don't always win and Mr. Smith does not always change Washington. However, as with most revisionist films, while the filmmakers spend a good deal of time deliberately blowing up genre tropes, they in equal part pay loving homage to those same tropes. ""Chinatown"" features some of the most sharpest hard boiled detective dialog ever committed to screen, there is gorgeous Hollywood style photography from cinematographer John A. Alonzo, and one of the most lush film scores to ever grace the screen from composer Jerry Goldsmith (Arguably his best score and composed in only 10 days after the original score was rejected. David Lynch says it's his all-time favorite film score.). The story even unfolds in a manner true to Chandler detective story traditions, with the entire film told from the perspective of the main character, Jake Gittes. Towne's script is a thing of beauty. The story and mystery progress with natural logic and makes perfect sense when it reaches its conclusion. Watching the film a second time, you can go back and see that all the pieces of the puzzle were right there in front of you from the beginning. All the clues to the mystery were there in plain sight. All the seemingly unimportant lines and character responses you interpreted to mean one thing now take on much different and deeper meanings. The script for ""Chinatown"" is a master class in storytelling. Beyond plot and story, Towne delivers, in true hard boiled detective fiction fashion, some of the most crackling dialogue you'll ever hear, and dialogue delivered by some of the greatest of Hollywood actors:",

I am a big fan of the genre (Phillip Marlowe, Sam Spade . . . you get the idea).  Jake Gittes is a really great character and I couldn't imagine anyone else BUT Jack Nicholson playing him.  In fact, I couldn't imagine anyone else in the whole cast as their characters (including Polanski). CHINATOWN can hold its own along with such classics as THE BIG SLEEP, FAREWELL MY LOVELY (or MURDER MY SWEET) and THE MALTESE FALCON. I remember reading that writer Towne and director Polanski fought over the ending.  I'd have to say that Polanski, though still reeling from the murder of wife Sharon Tate, had the right idea.  I could not imagine this film having a happy ending.  It certainly wouldn't have been as memorable. I was surprised that John Huston wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his performance as evil incarnate. Noah Cross is truly one of the cinema's greatest villains.  As much as I like Art Carney, there is no way he should have won the Best Actor Oscar over Nicholson's work here.  At least the screenplay deservedly won.  Forget it, Jake . . .",
92,4 May 2015,sandnair87,9," Roman Polanski's Caustic Neo-Noir is So Compelling that ""You Can't Forget It""!","It's Los Angeles, 1937. Jack Nicholson's private detective Jake J. Gittes is not a primal masculine archetype, but rather a complicated protagonist. Far from cool and collected, he is simply self- possessed, with a sense of control that's highly illusory and much of the film pivots on undercutting his misplaced self-confidence. The film immediately establishes his less-than-ideal persona via his work snapping pictures of adulterous spouses, a lowbrow form of detective work that is typically beneath the more admirable private eyes. He's looked down on by the law and treated as something of a sordid but necessary evil by his clients, but Jake realizes that's just how the game is played. Soon enough, though, one of those clients, a mysterious woman named Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray finds a way to use Jake's scurrilous reputation to set him up for a fall. His ensuing attempts to clear his name put him on the trail of a case that's bigger, more complex and wide-ranging than anything he's used to, coming up with more rot than he bargained for. One that goes, as they say, all the way to the top!",

There are too many to count in every one of these.  She could be a daughter, then a lover, then a wife, then a man. It doesn't matter, apparently all of you fools will buy into anything they tell you and call it a masterpiece.  You may as well watch 'Days of our Lives'.

""Chinatown"" is a movie which ends up being an indelible display of how egocentric megalomania supersedes all other emotions! Such abominable behavior reflects a myriad of despicable qualities of many individuals which pertain to the abhorrent aspects of human nature. The director of this film, Roman Polanski, has had a tenuously depraved life. (Including his tragic marriage to Sharon Tate). This movie is considered to be Polanski's best film ever! ""Chinatown"" is based on a true story, one which inflicted a lot of suffering for the city of Los Angeles, and, the vast majority of it's citizens sometime back in the 1930's!! The intensity of agitation in this film is astounding!! Jack Nicholson's performance in this film is remarkable!! Faye Dunaway's performance as Evelyn Mulray is considered by some prominent movie critics, to be the 36th best acting performance in the history of movie making!! This does not surprise me, I felt that Faye Dunaway's performance in ""Network"" was the best acting performance I have ever seen!! The movie, ""Chinatown"" is about people who are unscrupulous and miserable!! Often times, character portrayals about people who are victims of their environment are usually depicted with the indigent or the oppressed, in the movie ""Chinatown"", the environmental victims were the wealthy and the powerful!! Hatefulness, callousness, not to mention the blatant disregard for hard working individuals, as well as their overall well being, all became second nature reactions with the hegemony of Los Angeles. (i.e. Noah Cross and a handful of pork barrel politicians). ""Chinatown"" emanates a subtle tolerance for lethal chicanery by making conspiracy, cover ups, and collusion complete and utter masterpieces of understatement. This film evokes a repugnant display of human intuition by merely divulging some simple, yet, clinically ruthless facts!! Accommodating plausibility translated to dollar signs with everyone in the film. Vindictiveness with all of these plutocratic and nefarious scoundrels in ""Chinatown"" ultimately relegated them to the precarious plight of having to reap what they've sown. Their recriminations became a proverbial case of too little too late. What wound up being the single most appropriate adjective for describing this film, was the cogently riveting one of POWERFUL!! At the end of this film all negative behavioral ugliness patterns propagated a disconcerting state of resonating despair. The directing in this movie is unbelievable. The acting is sensational. The cinematography and melodic genre in ""Chinatown"" is unprecedented, basically second to none!! Most critics rate ""Chinatown"" as one of the top twenty American films ever made, I agree!! One of Hollywood's best efforts to ever hit the silver screen!! Especially on account of itemizing the aggregate character assassinations of every main character in the film!!The movie ""Chinatown"" is AN ABSOLUTELY MARVELOUS CLASSIC OF ALL TIME!!",

100,4 May 2017,oOoBarracuda,10, Chinatown,"Isolation, corruption of police, turning a profit on natural resources, each issue is tackled in brilliant form in the 1974 film by Roman Polanski. Dealing with his own internal turmoil near the time of filming, Polanski opted not for the happy ending screenwriter Robert Towne wanted and fought for, but instead the brutality of real life. Sometimes people die who are not supposed to, and oftentimes, things don't work out as they should and people are worse off than they began. I'm a humanist and a fan of humanistic films (I'm gazing at you, Francois Truffaut) so I appreciate when a film forgoes the ending tying everything up with a bow and opts for the realism that often leaves life less neat than we would like. Chinatown takes place in Los Angeles in 1937 where J.J. Gittes, a private eye is hired to find out if a husband is cheating on his wife. Jake soon realizes he is tailing a powerful man and gets pulled into a web of money and politics he could never have anticipated. Starring Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, and legendary John Huston, Chinatown is a perfect neo-noir, so perfect in fact that lines are often blurred and the film is often referred to as a noir rather than a neo-noir. Chinatown came out over 40 years ago in one of the very best years of American cinema and has persisted as a pinnacle of cinematic art.",

Starring Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, and somewhat hilariously, John Huston, it is the story of a private investigator sent to snoop on a cheating husband only to later find that husband turned up dead, setting off a chain of events that leads to the top being blown off a major conspiracy that runs deep into the roots of early 20th century Los Angeles.   It's a shame that the only part of the film the average film-goer knows about is the most famous line, ""Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown."" That's a wonderful line, but out of context, what does it mean? Nothing. You could guess or even infer, but unless you've seen the film, it might as well be sitting out on an island.

Both Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway were on a roll when they came together for this Roman Polanski-directed work and it shows in this four star movie. The acting by the two leads was reinforced by an excellent script, musical score and a highly polished style that Polanski drew from the mid century cinema of Bogart, Bacall, Garfield, and Greenstreet. Polanski's short scene also makes an interesting sidebar to the plot. The diversion of the Los Angeles water supply during a major drought is the major element with Nicholson and Dunaway crossing paths and then getting ensnared in the unfolding drama. The main villain is none other than John Huston, leaving his director's chair to deliver a first rate performance as public enemy #1. This movie's final scene beckons your attention.",
107,5 June 2006,Sylviastel,9," Except for the Ending, this is a classic film!","This film follows Roman Polanski's mindset. By the time, he directed Chinatown, Polanski had survived the Holocaust in Poland and survived the Manson trial. I know Polanski is guilty of molesting a young girl and fled the country. Those events occurred after this film. For the record, Jack Nicholson is brilliant as Jake, a man with a conscious. Fay Dunaway is brilliant as Mrs. Mulray and the legendary John Huston acting as her father is bone-chilling. The film is the story about life in Los Angeles during the great depression when it was nothing at the time before all the development. It's hard to believe that Los Angeles was once a small town that prospered into the entertainment capital of the world. It has become one of the world's priciest places to live in or around. The story is well-known especially about the relationship between Mrs. Mulray and her father, Mr. Cross. But in 1974, they never would have revealed such truths. After all, Huston plays a powerful wealthy businessman and investor. I am giving it a nine because I dislike the ending.

It was even placed 3rd greatest screenplay of all time, by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) amongst such titles as Casablanca, The Godfather and Anne Hall, which arguably I feel is the greatest of them all. Starring Jack Nicholson in what I believe to be a career defining performance, even surpassing his Oscar winning exploits with One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest and even his ever chilling performance in The Shining.

120,16 October 2018,Nico-Scaeva,2, Terrible Ending Made the Movie a Waste of Time,"My goodness. What an awful ending. It was as if they got too deep into all their twists and turns that, instead of attempting to untie the knots and resolve the plot, they just decided to end it and be done with it as abruptly as possible. It also felt like it was a sequel to another movie that actually had something to do with or at least used the subject of Chinatown for more than a couple ominous and vague one-liners. It honestly felt like this was Chinatown 2 and I missed the far superior, more exciting Chinatown 1. It was as if the writers knew they liked the line ""Forget it, Jake. That's Chinatown"" but were so eager to end the movie with it that didn't bother to explain to the audience the significance of the line. It was like a callback that didn't have an initial call. A comparable example is the line TIA (This Is Africa) in Blood Diamond. It's used early on and you get a sense of its many different meanings and it's supposed familiarity amongst Africans and then the line is called back in a very moving way at the end. That's what the Chinatown line at the end should have been, but wasn't. I am just in awe as to the lengths people in the film community will go to to fall in line with the status quo on things like this. I cannot imagine anyone has ever seen Chinatown and been moved or enthralled to the point of wanting to watch it again. It seems to me that, much like the contemporary art community, film critics put on kid gloves when it comes to the so-called noir genre and are absolutely ready and willing to write off any lack of depth, lack of character development, and terrible endings as insightful and artistic noir touches. Why even name the movie Chinatown if there are only going to be 4 lines in the whole movie having to do with Chinatown? So many roads to nowhere in that movie. And then in the end, the whole movie is a road to nowhere. Chinatown could be summed up as: a private detective spends two hours unfurling an intricate web of conspiracy and corruption and then it just ends.",

Basically JJ 'Jake' Gittes (BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Jack Nicholson, in what many consider his ""best-ever role"", I personally love him in Cuckoo's Nest) is the private detective, who makes an honest living sticking his nose into others lives, specialising in matrimonial cases. He is hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Bonnie and Clyde's Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Faye Dunaway) when she suspects her husband Hollis (Darrell Zwerling), who built the city water supply system, of having an affair. He professionally photographs him with a young girl, but he does not realise in this scandal is that Mrs. Mulwray is an impersonator. When Hollis is found dead (drowned with salt water in his lungs), Jake is now in the middle of a case of deceit, murder, incest and municipal corruption, all relating back to the city's water supply. The memorable moments for me are Jake having his nose cut, finding out that Evelyn has a sister/daughter, because her villain father, Noah Cross (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated John Huston) raped her, and the conclusion where Evelyn is driving away and shot in the eye.

The movie tells the story of a private detective named J.J Gittes (played by Jack Nicholson) who is hired to expose an adulterer named Evelyn Mulwray (played by Faye Dunaway) who ends up finding himself in a web of deceit, corruption, and murder. The movie stars Jack Nicholson as Gittes who also specializes in matrimonial cases then gets hired by Mulwray to suspect that her husband i having an affair with another woman. Director Roman Polanski made this film turn out to be a success at the box office, this movie compares to police movie classics such as Dirty Harry, The French Connection, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, The Departed and many more. This film also has a kind of similar plot line just like John Huston's The Maltese Falcon but with Humphrey Bogart in the title role. The movie also stars John Huston as Dunaway's father, Burt Young, Perry Lopez, and John Hillerman. This movie is one of the v very best police movies ever made in the history of cinema.",

He was diving in to a deep sea of talent and ingenuity decades after the grandmasters of film had sold their souls to Satan for the black magic necessary to take the limited and restrictive technology available at the time and make the delicious oreo visuals that made great films even greater despite something like technicolor visuals still being the fever dream of a schizophrenic whisper. But despite the Vesuvian challenge lain out before them, the people responsible for Chinatown managed to make a film so great that there's no doubt in my mind it could go toe to toe with any of the classics and end up absolutely busting its sorry face. I'm talking a good old fashioned jaw- ripping, tooth necklace making face busting. That is to say if Chinatown were faced with a ""Two films enter, one film leaves"" type situation, my money's on Chinatown.",

His wise guy determination not to be screwed over makes the perfect foil for Dunaway's worldly innocence. All of the supporting actors pitch their tents on this base and none come up wanting. Of course Polanski was the genius behind the curtain and no matter what his personal foibles he gave us Chinatown, a period piece, humanistic commentary, railyard gristle, and detective story up with the best of them.

158,12 April 2001,HenryHextonEsq,10, Slow-burning Classic; truly one of the best films.,"A strange, one-off film this one. A re-entry to the film noir genre twenty-five years on for Hollywood, that refines and extends the scope of the genre. Certainly up there with ""The Third Man"", ""Touch of Evil"" and ""Rear Window"" in the suspense and mystery stakes; ""Chinatown"" contains so much depth under the surface, and detail, that you'll feel cheated by the mediocrity of today's Hollywood output. A truly impressive script, coupled with vivid, disciplined direction from the skilled Roman Polanski, and ornate photography create a masterful, tangible atmosphere of rich dread. The performances rise to the occasion without being too OTT; Nicholson is a fine, laconic Gittes, Faye Dunaway is just right for this role; she has the right mixture of cold aloofness and tangible sensuality. Of course, the ""She's my sister..."" scene is wonderfully delivered by the wrought Dunaway. Ah yes, and John Huston, who has comparitively minimal screen time, makes a startling impression as Noah Cross; a thoroughly baneful figure. There is so much to savour in this masterpiece for those who can take in it at the correct, languid but progressive pace. The whole look of the film is immensely attractive and the dialogue is clever and often witty. On top of that, it is a serious film about moral and personal decadence, with the viewer left both doleful and exhilarated. The final scene is excellent, with a wonderful closing line, and direction to the close. One of the most ingenious, intoxicating of all films. Rating:- *****/*****",

Although, I watched Chinatown just last weekend and I already forgotten nearly everything about it. It's so slow, that I lost the gist of the what story is even about. The storyline is just too convoluted. It is too dialogue heavy. Had the dialog been interesting, I could forgive that. The setting of Chinatown is the 1930s and it feels like it was filmed in the 30s. There are lot of 30s clichés. There's some suspense and ironic twists. But overall just too bland and boring.

First of all, Jack Nicholson portraits a great character, very different from the types we got used to see him playing later on. John Houston is also very believable in a role that could have easily turned into a stereotype.

When the husband ends up dead the woman who plans on suing the detective will now need to work with him. This movie is directed by Roman Polanski (The Tenant) and stars Jack Nicholson (The Shining), Faye Dunaway (Bonnie and Clyde), Diane Ladd (Wild at Heart), John Huston (Casino Royale) and Perry Lopez (Kelly's Heroes). The storyline for this is very intricate with several clever twists and turns. I loved the attire and settings in this and Nicholson was perfect as the main character. I loved his ""fight scenes"" and the beatings he took were hilarious. The dialogue was clever and well executed and the ending was perfect.

As a native of southern California I grew up knowing something about Mulholland the Water Baron, on whom I assume aspects of both Hollis Mulwray and Noah Cross were based, and this fictionalization imparts the intrigues and era extremely well. Polanski was fortunate that -- when filming Chinatown -- there were still authentic locations in existence; someone would be harder- pressed to simulate 1930's L.A. now.

To start things off the cast is fantastic in this movie, Jack Nicholson is magnificent especially his subtle acting, for example after Mrs. Mulwray saves him from being shot, the way he looks at her indicates its the first sign he is starting to fall in love her. There is also another scene in the movie where Jack shows brilliance in his subtle acting where he is checking up on Mrs. Mulwray because he feels something suspicious is going on, while he is driving just the look on his face shows that he is tired and he has been through a lot through out the day. Faye Dunaway is fantastic in this film as well and seeing her and Jack work together in this movie was amazing. Just like the acting the movie itself is also very subtle, the theme is not just straight up in your face it does require some thinking. This movie is also very good at foreshadowing for instance when Jake and Mrs. Mulwray are at the restaurant she says that she has had affairs but she would not call it cheating on her husband, that is indicating her father Noah Cross has raped her which is revealed later on in the movie. Noah Cross is a very disturbing villain the more I think about it because he is an old person who has raped his daughter and killed his son-in-law/former business partner and the actor who played him did a really good job. The movie is able to not feel messy even when a lot of things are going on and instead feels contained. The scene where he talks about his past in chinatown I felt like that could have been a movie by itself because in his past he talks about how he tries to protect this woman and later she dies, the same thing happens in the film where the woman who he is trying to protect dies and gets killed, he tries to do the right thing throughout the movie but in the end he is vulnerable and can't win and it was unavoidable and Jake is back to where he was before. The message of this movie is not a positive one but it is honest and it is great to sometimes see a movie that is not perfectly wrapped with a bow and everything is all good.

He's one of the best actors of all time.  What can I say?  And I liked the slick dialogue that's typical of film noirs.  For example, I like when Jack says, ""You're right.  When you're right, you're right.  And you're right."" Another one of my favorites when one of the other detectives asks what happened to his nose.  He replies, ""Your wife got a little too excited and crossed her legs too fast, if you know what I mean.""  I also liked the tragic ending, but other than that I can't say any other good things about the movie.  ",

Dunaway gives perhaps the best performance of her career as the tormented Femme Fatale with a secret past. The fine supporting cast includes Huston as a menacing patriarch. This is the best film on Polanski's impressive resume and he beautifully evokes 1930s L.A. with a film noir look composed of muted colors, perfectly complemented by Goldsmith's moody score and Towne's Oscar-winning script. The director also has a memorable cameo as a knife-wielding heavy. A haunting masterpiece.",

Instead, it looks (as the original review in The New York Times pointed out), more like Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn with a few neon signs flickering in the background for Oriental flavor, filmed on an artificial, improvised set. It's a letdown when the film's most crucial moments aren't given the careful period flavor that goes into the majority of the piece. It's also unworthy of the film's final line: ""Forget it, Jake.

202,4 May 2012,Sergio_Falco,10, What to say?,"Is there much to say about Chinatown that hasn't already been said? The screenplay is brilliant, the casting and performances are superlative. The art direction, costumes, style, and feel of the visuals are impeccable. The new blu ray release has a great commentary by Robert Towne and David Fincher, and if you're a fan of the film, this is a must. A few thoughts were provoked from this commentary. Firstly, it's interesting just how many times the camera is behind Jack Nicholson's shoulder, forming a not-quite-POV shot, and allowing the audience a voyeuristic entrance into many of the scenes and physical spaces. It's also intriguing how there are three levels of crime in the film; the major crime of the land grab and the rape of the valley; the personal crime committed by Noah Cross on his daughter; and a third level, which is in a sense a 'crime' committed by Jake Gittes. The Oedipus myth is much discussed when it comes to detective stories, and as Towne readily admits in the commentary, it plays a part in Chinatown. Gittes has tried to help a woman in his past and only ended up hurting her. Throughout Chinatown, he hunts for the solution to the mystery, hunts for the villain, confident in his ability to ultimately triumph. But this near hubris on his part will finally lead to the death of yet another woman he tried to help. If he had just stayed out of it, just tried to do as little as possible, then maybe she would have been saved. In a sense, the criminal he is looking for is ultimately revealed to be Jake himself... To work this level of complexity into a screenplay, and yet to make it unfold in such a way that everything is clearly understandable as you watch it, is true mastery of the art of screen writing and film-making.",

205,1 April 2009,HorrorFan112490,10, Pure Cinema,"Chinatown is a masterpiece...plain and simple. It is a one of a kind film that is without flaw. I'm sure some would argue with me, but in my honest opinion it is a perfect work of art. The direction by master-class helmsman Roman Polanski is incredible, creating demanding images and performances by those involved. Jack Nicholson as the against-type private detective Jake J. Gittes depicts a hero that none have seen before or after. Faye Dunaway is in an unrivaled performance as Evelyn Mulwray, a mysterious beauty who hides a lot more than she can handle. Really, though, John Huston manages to become a scene-stealer as the vile aristocrat Noah Cross, who creates a villain so memorable, it puts so many to shame. The story by Robert Towne is crafted with great precision and pacing, using the water scandal of Los Angeles in the 1910's and 20's as a backdrop to the main story. Gittes is approached by a woman claiming to be Evelyn Mulwray (Diane Ladd) and asks him to investigate her husband, Hollis Mulwray, the city's chief engineer of the water department. After a bit of small sleuthing and following Mulwray, he catches him with a blonde and the photographs he's taken become a treasure for the press. In steps the real Evelyn Mulwray (Dunaway), who threatens to sue Gittes for his investigation into her husband, which she didn't warrant. Unfortunately several days later, Hollis is found dead in the reservoir and thus begins the investigation as to who framed him and killed Hollis Mulwray. Usually in the hands of any other director or writer, this could've turned into a run-of-the-mill whodunit, but Towne's scripts adds so many unexpected twists and turns throughout the story, leading the audience to unexpected places. Evelyn's shocking revelation is just one of the great surprises that bombards the viewer. The thing that really brings the film together, though, is the ending. Towne had something much more upbeat in mind, but Polanski, who had gone through a great trauma 5 years before the film's production, decided a more human ending was necessary, which makes the film so much greater. ""Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown,"" will ring in the viewers ears even after the credits have rolled. Ah, I almost forgot to mention Jerry Goldsmith's score, which brings the film a great atmosphere, much akin to that of The Maltese Falcon, another great crime-noir (which was directed by John Huston.). In concluding I say that Chinatown is pure cinema. And I mean PURE CINEMA. You just can't get any better with Chinatown.",

This film has a mix of humor, suspense and romance which make a movie great. One of Gittes' associates is played by Bruce Glover who played a killer in the James Bond film ""Diamonds are Forever"" in 1971. One of the other things that makes this film great is an unforgettable music score by Jerry Goldsmith who should have won the Oscar in 74 for this score. But he lost to Nino Rota for the Godfather Part II. If you haven't seen this film yet, watch it. You won't be disappointed. **** out of ****.",
208,13 May 2019,truemythmedia,10, One of the Best of the Best,"Noir films were more a part of the cultural mainstream during the 1930s through the 1950s than they are today. Hardboiled detective films used to flood the theaters of yesteryear as superhero films flood theaters today. Everyone from Humphrey Bogart (""The Maltese Falcon"") to Jimmy Stewart (""Vertigo"") to Orson Welles (""The Third Man"") donned the fedora and proverbial magnifying glass. ""Chinatown"" might have arrived thirty years past the primetime of noir films, but it still is one of the best of the genre.
Jake himself is one of the better noir protagonists, because while he might fit some of the detective tropes, he also makes the role his own. One of the main things that make Jake interesting is the journey he takes a character. When we first meet Jake, he doesn't seem particularly content in his work; he seems to be doing it just to make ends meet. But as the film goes on, we watch as Jake's casual approach to his job falls away, and he frantically scrambles to find out what happens. Watching Jake shift from an uncaring and distant detective to a detective so personally involved in the case not only makes him a thrilling character, it makes the ending so much more intense and tragic.
Another thing I really like about this film is that nothing really feels forced as far as storyline. I've read my fair share of mystery novels and seen more than my fair share of mystery movies, and it always bugs me how many overly coincidental moments play into the detective (or protagonist) solving the mystery. Even in some of Polanski's other works, I've taken issue with the way some revelations are handled. For example, in ""The Ghost Writer"", there's a scene where the protagonist (played by Ewan McGregor) gets information only because he gets caught on the other side of an island during a rainstorm and he just happens to stop at a house where a character saw some vital information and was willing to relay it to the protagonist. That whole scene felt incredibly coincidental, yet the film wouldn't have worked without it. ""Chinatown"" doesn't really have any of those moments; instead, the script is drum-tight.
Without going into any details, just know that the last scene of this film is the scene that solidifies its greatness. The ending sells the bleakness of the themes and world in a way that feels tragic but totally unavoidable. No matter what Jake did, the film was always going to end the way that it did, and that really emphasizes the hopelessness of the world that Polanski has so carefully crafted. It might not be a happy film (this is Polanski we're talking about- he doesn't have many happy films), but it is a brilliant representation of the noir genre, and one of the most memorable detective films of all time.",

233,11 January 2011,andy-933-696608,10, Chinatown Movie Review,"A long time favorite of mine and a classic that I believe Jack Nicholson can truly be remembered for as his greatest work of cinematic art. Director Roman Polanski and screen writer Robert Towne give audiences a masterpiece of both drama and suspense from the wondering viewpoint of Nicholson's character Gittes, a man who's profession is to find the truth, although the truth might be more than what he'd hoped to discover. Having a dark history in La's Chinatown, Gittie makes his honest living by exploiting the dark secrets few people want out. The secrets usually are born from either rumors or suspicions of affairs. A mysterious women claiming to be Hollis Mularay's wife, Evelyn hires Jake to scoop out the truth and find out if there really is someone else. Jake would've probably thought of old Hollis to be the most fascinating tail he's ever tracked in years, following him to public meetings, beaches, and even a mistress that finishes it all. Hollis is no ordinary guy, being the partner of Noah Cross (Houston), Evelyn's crafty and suspicious father, in the LA water and power department. It doesn't really matter to Jake, all that matters is his objective, and the sweet payday received for his work. His work results in more than just a simple check, but the consequences of widespread publicity, attracting the attention of the real, and truly more sophisticated Evelyn Mulray (Dunaway), who feels both insulted and obliged for the matter to be taken care of courtroom style. It's to Jakes luck and Evelyn's misfortune that he never sees the sight of judge, at the cost of Hollis's life though. The very sight of his body being dragged from a water reservoir, with salt water in his lungs is enough for the cops to call it an accidental death. Jake on the other hand, saw it as murder, believing the pieces in this puzzle all fit. The first piece started with the fake Evelyn looking to bust Mulray with a mysteriously significant mistress, thus reaching the second piece as the real Evelyn sues, then quickly draws back on the lawsuit, ending with the final piece of Mulray's murder. The plot escalates from secrets into answers stemming to the very dark and puzzled world Gittes use to live in. If non of you readers get what I'm talking about, I mean Chinatown, a place where the cops were meant to do as little as possible, never knowing whether they were helping the good or the bad. Chinatown, a place riddled with corruption, drugs, and dark aspiring mystery. Thus, Jakes suspicions place him on a quest to find the whole point of this elaborate plot to bury the truth, following up all kinds of leads that'll make viewers ask more and more questions on the very little, but defining significance they represent. Take for instance the missing mistress of Hollis Mulray. Why is it so important to Noah Cross that she be found? According to Evelyn and several people at Water and Power, Mulray and Cross had a falling out on where the water in LA should go. Either to the City or the People of LA. Many were suffering from the drought, particularly those in the south, raising live stock, with little water, and poisoned wells. It all seems detrimental. More though to the mystery of Hollis's murder, the truth behind it goes to the nature of secrecy that Plagues ""Chinatown"". A little bird (Fake Eveyln) sings a little, giving Jake a few names to look up, only to see their names as the already deceased, leaving him with the conclusion that Hollis knew to much. Jake himself puts himself in the same shoes, as he learns far more about his employer Evelyn than he should know. After a quick, but in the moment and straight to the bedroom romance with Evelyn, Jake's sense to spy leads to the discovery of Hollis's missing mistress, and forcing Evelyn to tell more than she's been saying half the film. Baring the child of your own father, while calling yourself her sister must no doubt be one of the toughest burdens ever, especially when it come to protecting that secret from a man who wants to have the child as his own. Noah Cross, the master mind behind all, reveals not only his place of being Katherine's father, but also the intention of incorporating LA's Northwest valley, and thus irrigating it. As we viewers draw to a close, the films ends in its title of focus, Chinatown. When struggling for the truth, Jake fails to save those he loves at the very remark of ""Forget it Jake its Chinatown"". A magnificent ending to film, that incorporates the elements of historical corruption, love, mystery, thrill, suspense, and furthermore the realistic notion of it's title ""Chinatown"". Chinatown, like general life is what it is, sometimes good triumphs over evil, and the other times, evil triumphs over good to our personal distaste. I honestly see this as one of Nicholson's most trademarked characters, using both his dark and even haunting history, as well as his slick wit to further move himself forward in the films mystery of a story, while collaborating with Dunaway's portrayal of an even more tortured figure. Mulray has gone through the unholy touch of her father at the bedside, hiding his child, and doing all she can to conceal her truth, expressing her partial dishonesty in the very doubt of her voice. Despite his short screen time, John Houston's performance is both as haunting, and yet the least tortured of the film's characters, feeling little regret for his sins, while pursuing his power hungry goals with an almost terrifying form of expressing his want for them. ""Chinatown"" itself, using it's musical romance theme can haunt a fan, almost as much as it's done to the hero J.J. Gittes.",

Faye Dunaway did an incredible job as well as the mysterious, Evelyn Mulwray, she also got nominated for an Oscar. And finally, the hauntingly beautiful music by Jerry Goldsmith, which is my favorite composer ever, and, he also got nominated for an Oscar. The only reason I did not give this film a ten was because of the length of the film, and it is very difficult to give a movie a ten, but other then that, this film is perfect.",
237,10 July 2007,boomerchinde,10, Hollywood at its best,"I know I'm stepping out on a limb here, but here goes: Chinatown is, in my opinion, the finest American film ever made. Yes, I know Citizen Kane and Casablanca are the top favorites of film historians, but I still hold my ground here. Superb in every aspect of film making -- acting, editing, direction, musical score, cinematography and on and on. Polanski captures the 1930's film noir in color, and pulls it off beautifully. Robert Towne's screenplay is used at the USC school of film making as an example of how to write. His work is simply astounding. Nicholson gives his finest performance -- even better than his superb offering in On Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. His Jake Gittes character is at the same time cynical and sympathetic. Dunaway has never been more mysterious, Huston has never been more ominous, and every supporting member of the cast is perfection personified. The closest any film maker has come to capturing such a mood and theme since has been the fine work of L A Confidential. Even if you don't like period pieces, mysteries, private eyes and conspiracy films, this movie deserves your accolades as an example of how films can and should be produced. There are only 50 or so American films that have reached perfection, and Chinatown is at the top of the list.",

On one hand, it's simply a rock-solid mystery thriller chock full of quotable dialogue (my favorite line is Gettis to a police officer, ""Nevermind, you're dumber than you think I thought you were.""), political intrigue, snazzy private eyes, troublesome dames, grizzled henchmen, and excellent plot twists that service the story and aren't just there for the sake of surprise.  The scene where Gettis is slapping around Faye Dunaway's character in an attempt to get to the truth about the mystery girl is probably the best executed and most brilliantly conceived way to reveal a shocking plot twist in a movie that I have ever seen.

Many people who dislike the film have called it boring and they do not like the ending. They forget the film is about a serious subject matter and shouldn't be handled like an action movie. Polanski, along with the rest of the cast, handle the story with maturity and precision, the way it should be. Polanski does not insult the viewers' intelligence. He forces us to use our imagination about past events and events that are currently happening. It may take several viewing to put all the pieces together, but with each viewing the film becomes more meaningful. Even though the film ends on an unhappy note, people must understand why the film ended that way. The ending is one of the reasons the film is so powerful and unforgettable.

The script by Robert Towne is excellent and intelligent with many memorable moments and twists.  The highlights of this film are the Chinaman joke (easily Nicholson's best and funniest monologues), Dunaway's stunning daughter/sister revelation, Roman Polanski's knife-wielding thug that provides one of Hollywood's most memorable props and the film's surprising conclusion.

I won't give you the spoiler of the movie, but I can say that it is a Fritzl noir film (incest) with everyone in the characters not giving key information from the detective which they paid him to hire. Imagine 3 clients from a related group of people hiring Gites. And each of them holding key information and a holds a conspiracy too big to handle. It is actually very easy to write a story with Fritzl type movie with a larger then life conspiracy and a detective who isn't too clear and have no plan. In fact I find it a child's play to write movies where it raises too many questions and nothing can be done about it just to overwhelm the senses. One was that mysterious Hal malfunction in Stanlely Kubrick, although no answer was provided, that was provided by the movie 2010, and 2001 remains somewhat of a mystery. And to make it appear complex is actually easy then to make it simple in any scriptwriting work. While critically acclaimed, because of the secrecy and mystery surrounds the movie, it could be a complete opaque. In any event I don't like the movie because it drags, too mysterious and there's nothing you can do about the crime in Los Angeles. The pass the movie as something you just have to accept. I believe can be done about it, but the veil of mystery is gone. The movie explains nothing and writing this style of movie won't get a blockbuster, audiences and just bore someone to tears. The writing style such as this is also easy to do or imitate and this is not the kind of story writing I like other people to emulate either. It's sloppy work to have any story without a clear story or actions by the characters. It makes for a very sloppy writing and is extremely easy to write. Hence, I find the movie bad.

Chinatown would be just another Private Eye movie, by the numbers, if not for the performance of Jack Nicholson. Maybe Coburn, Bogart, and Gerald Butler could pull this role off. Chinatown would cause a Woke melt down if made today, but the gritty charm makes the viewer want to watch the disfunction in a Nicholson way. Like the Shinning Jack is gritty and ugly. Fair in his own way, but bends rules. Memorable parts like the nose incident which gives the viewer a sick laugh threw out the film. The back and forth of the characters relationships with Jack mixes well with Chinatown's mystery.

Much as I enjoy watching the man when he is on top form like this, he does distract from the working of the film. Also, good though his performance is, he does not convince of his attraction to Dunaway. Talking of the leading lady, I may as well try an deal with another irritation, this whole mystery surrounding her and its clarification at the end. I think the whole mother/sister incest business is another distraction and just a little too close to home with regard to the director and his known sexual preferences.

Detective Jake Gittes, played by Nicholson, is at a glance, your average private eye snoop. He's sneering, untrustworthy and his reputation in and around Los Angeles is much worse. LA is in the midst of a severe drought, and Gittes, during one of his daily endeavours, has uncovered sinister activity by the Department of Water & Power that has the company reaping unfair financial rewards at the cost of unsuspecting landowners. Then there is the mysterious wealthy socialite, Evelyn Mulwray, played by Faye Dunaway, that comes to Gittes for help, but never quite reveals the full length of her troubles. She's elusive, seductive and tangled up in Chinatowns puzzle more than what she's willing to own up to. The drought of course is public knowledge, but when the Boss of Water & Power turns up dead in a reservoir, the LA community soon learn that foul play runs far beyond the boardroom. One of Chinatown's charms is the audience never knows more than Gittes at that certain point. Our detective is never one step ahead, and neither is the audience. Chinatown is not only a noir mystery film, but it's a superior thriller that keeps the viewer deeply involved from the start, to its tragic end.",

Jack Nicholson was great, this is easily some of his best work, but his character was messy, imperfect, inconsistent at times. As for the story, it said a lot for the way L. A. was built, the corruption, the people, the way things were done in the '70s, yet at the same time left out important details about the characters we were supposed to care about.

Story,"Roman Polanski's celebrated neo-noir 'Chinatown' was made when the director, and his star Jack Nicholson, were arguably both at the peak of their powers; indeed, there's a strong case that the early 1970s represented a golden age for the Hollywood movie, full stop. One achievement of this film is the actor's, Nicholson creating the character of the fast talking private eye while staying clear of the shadow of Philip Marlowe: perhaps one can think of Jake Gittes as a younger version of Chandler's hero, not yet as disillusioned (at least, this is true at the start of the film). One can also state he avoids his own shadow, playing wholly within the role, something he has not always managed since. Meanwhile, Robert Towne's intelligent script, about the economic growth and control of Los Angeles, seems particularly appropriate for a Hollywood film. In late career, Polanski has made some pretty ropey thrillers: but here his direction is taut throughout, and the film is compelling and atmospheric. It deserves its reputation; and passes muster alongside the other amazing movies that Nicholson made between 1970 and 1975.",

She is ""Evelyn"", a woman who suspects that her husband ""Hollis"" (Darrell Zwerling) is playing away from home. She engages the services of the cynical PI ""Gittes"" (Jack Nicholson) and pretty soon people are dead and he is embroiled in an internecine story of adultery, corruption and manipulation that proves pretty perilous for a detective who is working with one women he suspects is being a bit frugal with the truth and another whose identity he is desperately struggling to discover. Nicholson is also on super form, his performance is natural and engaging with a solid chemistry between his and Dunaway adding a richness to this rather quirky plot. Roman Polanski has assembled a strong supporting cast - notably John Huston who features sparingly but effectively as her wealthy, untrustworthy, father ""Noah"" and the photography does a great deal to help generate a sense of accumulating intrigue as we gradually make some headway through this complicated and interesting character study. The production looks great - the 1930s costume and motor cars alongside a smattering of the simmering attitudes that prevailed at the time are encapsulated well too. It's a shade over two hours, but it hits the ground running and never really stops until the ending that though not entirely unexpected, still has enough elements of surprise to keep it compelling.",

Robert Towne, the screenwriter, did a magnificent job but Roman Polanski was right about the ending- I won't spoil it- which Towne was so much against. Jack Nicholson delivers one of his strongest performances as a Private Detective J.J. Gittes who faces many problems and uncovers many things that soon lead to a memorable night in Chinatown. Nominated for 11 Oscars, it won one for best screenplay, Robert Towne.

Los Angeles is desert and the movie in many scenes makes us feel the encroaching dust, heat and lifelessness being held at bay. Nandu Hinds played Jake's secretary Sophie with the doll-like face.

Rather than connecting plots smoothly and naturally, they are spread out sparsely. Jack Nicholson follows the leads without giving enough evidences to audience. He just realizes very suddenly by himself. For example, when he accuses deputy Yelburton, there is no connection why he makes that choice. Additionally, Faye Dunaway and he visit a nursing home to find a clue about Crabb, and he just 'accidently' talks to an old lady who has s a towel of Albacore Club owned by Noah Cross.

Names are false, motives are false or never understood. Gittes, who at first seems like a sleazeball, is in fact a white knight seeking after truth. The cool blonde is anything but. Other film makers would pull close-ups on the clues that are dropped in plain view throughout the movie, but with Polanski, they are there but you just don't see them, any more than Gittes, until it all comes together at the end.

316,14 March 2006,kwalsh2-1,10, Superb film,"Polanski made ""Chinatown"" in the midst of artistic films. They do not require happy endings or the perfect shots. ""Chinatown"" creates the L.A. scene for a marriage detective, Nicholson, who gets caught up in a murder case. His involvement instigates a relationship with the woman whose life is wrapped up in the murder. However, the movie ends tragically by having the woman die and the murderer runs free. There are signs that point to this ending such as when J.J. surprises Evelyn in her car, she drops her head on the steering wheel and beeps the horn shortly, and dogs barking in the distance follow the sound. The end has Evelyn's head falling into the steering wheel when she is shot, and silence overcomes the crowd as she falls in silence into the detective's hands. The simplistic plot continually develops into a larger, more complex plot. While the movie initially has Nicholson discovering an affair, it turns into a plot for murder, and every movement and sign in the movie points toward something bigger even from the start. The man in the barber tells him that he does not know what he is getting into. This is very accurate, because the plot then takes another twist with the wife coming in saying that the other girl was not the wife. The plot is extremely complex and yet simple enough for the audience to understand. While the plot is very dark, Polanski sets up the atmosphere to match. The offices of Nicholson and Dunaway's husband produce that eerie feeling that something more is going on behind the scenes. Meanwhile, the supporting casts do a superb job in subtly constructing a tone of intricate involvement between each other. Jack Nicholson is a tough detective who seems aloof, but his affection for Dunaway becomes clear as he stands in silence upon her death. Dunaway similarly has a character that the audience seems to think they have pinned down. However, as the film progresses, so does her character. The famous scene where Nicholson slaps her in the face as she says, ""daughter, sister, daughter, sister"" becomes a landmark for showing how confusing it becomes to understand her. Huston darkens her intricate personality, but we do not know the actual problem until that scene. Meanwhile, Huston effectively comes across as an innocent old man, when he is the darkest character in the film. The actors all did an amazing job of successfully attaining that complex role while making it look simplistic.",
317,5 January 2008,brefane,8," It's Jake, Chinatown.","A beautifully crafted film noir that's earned the right to be called a classic. Masterfuly directed by Roman Polanski who makes cunning use of the widescreen, gets all the details unerringly right and creates a disturbing atmosphere of widespread corruption. John Alonzo's cinematography, Jerry Goldsmith's score, Sam O'Steen's editing, and the set and costume design are all flawless. Robert Towne's Oscar winning screenplay is a beauty though the ominous references to Chinatown become a bit obvious and heavy-handed, and the ending, apparently wanted by Polanski, makes the characters seem more the victims of contrivance than fate. Polanski gets effective performances from Dunaway, Huston, Diane Ladd, and Belinda Palmer. And Nicholson, who's in every scene, shows why he's a star even if I find him more effective in the wise guy aspects of the role than in the scenes where he's supposed to show vulnerability. Though I don't rank it as highly as Polanski's The Pianist, Knife in the Water, or Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown is highly recommended.",

As Jake Gittes discovers more and more of the twisted plot revolving around the death of Mr. Mulwray, a world of disgusting corruption is found. Towne's script is reinforced by two of the greates performances of all time: Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson. Dunaway is the perfect femme fatale; she pulls Jake into a case that is bigger than he can handle. Nicholson plays a more thoughtful character than his usual roles.

The only real surprise of the movie is the fact that salt water is not good for grass, all other twists (and there are many) are either hinted at too early in too obvious a way, or they come completely unprepared in a way which is meant to shock, which usually fails. This holds in particular for the daughter-sister-scene - on one hand hand I expect her to say something horrible, on the other hand, I have no clue what exactly she will say. So I am neither surprised, for I had no expectations which could be shaken, nor shocked, because the scene and its aim to shock has been heralded far too early. The ending is logical and would be nice, if Gittes wouldn't have talked to much before. So chinatown was already known as the symbol of ""we destroy what we love while trying to protect it"", and we can only wait and see how exactly destruction will take place.",

Gittes, played to perfection by Jack Nicholson in bravura performance which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, gets hired by a mysterious femme fatale named Evelyn Mulwray, played beautifully by Faye Dunaway in a brilliant Oscar nominated performance of great subtlety, to investigate her husband Hollis, the chief engineer of the L.A. water department of an extra-marital affair. Gittes is swept into a web of double dealings, deceits, political scandals and murder, which will lead to an unforgettable and powerful climax in 'Chinatown.' Masterful Oscar nominated direction by Polanski, with a captivating, intelligent Oscar winning original screenplay by Robert Towne, stunning Oscar nominated cinematography by John A, Alonzo, and an evocative Oscar nominated score by the late great Jerry Goldsmith. This tour-de-force benefits greatly from the superlative supporting performances by Bruce Glover, Perry Lopez, Burt Young John Hillerman, Diane Ladd, Darrell Zwerling, and James Hong. Special kudos must go to the late great director and character actor John Huston for his magnificent portrayal of the perverted and monstrously evil landowner Noah Cross, and to Roman Polanski for his memorable cameo appearance as a short sadistic switchblade wielding thug who savagely cuts Nicholson's nose.

When Nicholson tells him ""there are going to be a lot of p***ed people when they find out that they paid 8 million dollars for water they are not going to get"",Huston answers ""thats all been taken care off"".And thats it.I dont think that building a damm and redirecting water can be so easy,without anybody minding that they are not going to have water to drink!!! Then when Nicholson finally realizes that Cross is the villain,as if it is so difficult to know who runs things-everybody knows in a small town like LA was in the 30's-instead of trying to stop him he accepts to work for him and ends up helping him find the girl and destroy Dunaway.Basically,if Gittes had not involved himself Dunaway would have fled with her daughter.Gittes is the reason for the entire tragedy!!! This movie is really stupid.We follow Gittes,uncovering the truth because he wont accept to stop,and then we see  he is a complete moran and doesnt know what to do with it.",

Fay Dunaway was OK (she was terrific when she got slapped). The story is twisted so much so the viewer could write his own story as it happens in the movie. The ending was altered by Polanski who is another overrated director (see Barry Levinson's direction of ""Bugsy"") The ending was the anticlimax and the worst ending of any movie. In the '70s, directors like Coppola and Scorsese had not made their mark and Polanksi was the one of the new kid on the block who had connections (like Evans and Nicholson),and was known as a radical director for movie like ""Rosemarys Baby"". He was embraced instantly by his cronies. These days directors like Polanski are dime a dozen and he won't make a dent in Hollywood. Its obvious that he likes stories that were weird, or socio-pathic and most of his films had shock value. With advent of TV sitcoms this value is lost to the audience.

The screenplay by Robert Towne was neatly written out along with the good direction by Roman Polanski, with that saying, in being his last film in America. The film was a little confusing, but maybe I have to see it a second time to know everything. The ending was good and the dialogue had some really good lines such as my line at the top, that has become one of the most famous quotes.

It stars Jack, Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston with music by Jerry Goldsmith. The film was produced at the creative high for many involved including Polanski coming off of 'Rosemary's Baby', and Jack Nicholson's string of pictures through the 70's is amazing. 'Chinatown' was nominated for 11 Academy Awards but only wound up taking one home for Towne's original screenplay.

Jack Nicholson (in his best role and that says something for one of Hollywood's greats) plays the private detective who is in way over his head when he is hired to spy on the L.A. water commissioner, which leads him to become entangled in a sinister and convoluted case. It is such a complex film I would have to write about a 20,000 word essay before I could really tell you the story, so my advice is just watch it and be fascinated by the story (it may however take two watches before you can fully understand everything). You have a director (Roman Polanski) and a writer (Robert Towne) at the peak of their powers and a film which deserved more awards than the single one Robert Towne receieved (It was just unfortunate to be up in the same year as The Godfather II, another of Hollywood's great films).

The story here is both predictable as it is suspenseful and without the big screen presence of jack Nicholson may have not been anything more of a Roman Polanski diversion. The Los Angeles story is a great one to build around, but the ""you don't know who you're messing around with"" angle has been further exonerated from ingratiating gangster or back story horror plots decades ago and was left with a lack of follow through here. John Huston' villain carried as much weight as Marlon Brandro did in his later years. Big name, hot hair.

What kept me from really enjoying the movie is that director Roman Polanski chose the pace to be slow as maple syrup.  Despite that flaw, I found a few aspects of the film (cinematography, acting, musical score, etc.) to be fascinating and impressive.  Faye Dunaway is okay as the wealthy widow who Gittes falls for. Film legend John Huston is clever here as Noah Cross, a shady and wise millionaire who asks Gittes to find his daughter's only child.  Even Polanski appears in the movie as a dwarfish hoodlum who uses a knife to leave a cut on Jake's nose.  Robert Towne won an Oscar for his screenplay.

In this beautiful 70's film noir Nicholson doesn't just deliver a Humphrey B.-rip-off performance, but something darker, more cynical even. Faye Dunaway delivers a glorious two-faced femme fatale and John Huston is both subtle and blunt: evil incarnated. Polanski's filming and his pace are both sublime; cool, distant and reminiscent in every way of the noir-era. Watching the movie makes you feel sort of guilty, as though the filming-crew has washed its hands in blood. 70's movies will do that to you (Taxi Driver, the Godfather, etc). I don't want to be a cynic, claiming this type of film couldn't possibly be produced today. But it is a fact that Spielberg and Lucas and, heck, the eighties with their 'smooth cinema' corrupted the industry in a way, that makes this type of film something of a different era.

399,1 February 2008,HelloTexas11,8, who to believe?,"'Chinatown' is a rare achievement- it manages to update a classic 1940's film genre without ruining it, in this case the hardboiled private investigator/film noir genre. Not only does it not ruin it or turn it into a big in-joke for cinema buffs, 'Chinatown' actually expands on the formula to include elements that would not have been possible or acceptable in that earlier time. The basic plot does not sound all that enticing (private eye investigates water usage scandal) but that is really just the jumping off mark for a number of strange subplots, each one more bizarre than the previous. In best film noir fashion, characters are not who they seem to be, major plot points shrink in significance while seemingly minor ones prove vitally important. The man trying to unravel the whole caper, as they say, is Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private dick who usually specializes in smaller and more mundane cases, like marital infidelity. Before he knows it, Gittes is in over his head but he doesn't like being played for the fool, so he determines to find the truth no matter where it leads. What director Roman Polanski and writer Robert Towne end up with is a sort of revved-up, R-rated '70's combination of 'The Maltese Falcon' and 'The Big Sleep.' They keep all the conventions (the requisite opening scene where a mysterious woman shows up and hires the p.i., etc.) then elaborate on them and ultimately create some new ones. It's all great fun to watch and confusing as hell at times. John Huston plays Noah Cross, a wealthy monster of a man, whose evil isn't completely apparent till late in the film. Faye Dunaway is the femme fatale, Evelyn Mulwray, who hardly ever gives Gittes a truthful answer about anything (think Mary Astor in 'Maltese Falcon'). Towne's script is full of great dialogue and intriguing situations. Famously, he and Polanski feuded over the ending; Towne wanted a satisfactory resolution, Polanski, a downbeat one. The director won out. I don't think a 'happy ending' would have ruined the film, but the conclusion they used is certainly unforgettable. And now, of course, it's almost impossible to imagine 'Chinatown' ending any other way.",

They must not have seen the Godfather Parts I or II or a virtual host of other movies (Jaws, Rocky, Patton to name just three) that were more famous and much more noteworthy to the public. True this was one of Nicholson's best and most famous performances (along with The Shining, A Few Good Men, and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) and the same is true for Faye Dunaway perhaps her most famous role. She was young, beautiful, and talented and I know Ali McGraw couldn't have touched her performance in 2 million years. I have not seen this film for quite some time which explains why I don't believe it was the greatest film of the 1970's if it was I would have watched it more than a couple of times in my entire life. I never had much respect for Polanski's work and it had nothing to do with the accusations he committed a crime. I just didn't connect with any of his characters or his directing. No slam against him but I just didn't. If I remember correctly Detective Jake Gittes in L.A. is hired to investigate charges of adultery against a wealthy, influential man. When he turns up dead Gittes investigates and turns up a nefarious money making scheme involving the deceased's wife and his father-in-law turned business partner. I don't feel I need to throughly explain this movie as I'm sure it's been done a thousand times on this site but I do think people should view it as it is what I consider a classic. It's was just not that memorable to me aside from the ending which was pretty unexpected.",
406,16 August 2019,keiran-75504,9," Great acting, even better story","Jack Nicholson is an incredible actor his portrayal of a typical anti hero detective from the noir era is perfect. That's the first thing that I love about this movie. Nicholson is a bad guy with a good heart determined to uncover the corruption relating to the drought in LA. He uses threatening techniques to find details and figure out why he was tricked and what is going on. Along with Nicholson's spectacular acting the plot of the movie follows his perfection in stride. Watching Noah cross grab his granddaughter out of the car after her mother was shot is defeating enough, but knowing that our hero is unable to do anything about it is even worse. Throughout the movie Nicholson shines a light on the rich and power controlling the water in Los Angeles only to be stopped short in the end because the rich are too powerful. It's sad and symbolic at the same time, sometimes in life we can experience a problem but there's nothing in our power that we can do. It's a gritty and realistic story that lets audiences know things won't always work out, and that with enough money comes influence, and influence allows people to do what they want.",
407,16 August 2007,The_Orenda,9, What a movie.,"If ever you want to see a fine mystery, deserving in all its praise, look no further than Chinatown. The movie takes time to pick up, held together by none other than Nicholson, in a prime role, until the pieces of the puzzle start coming together. Once there, you cannot help it, but ultimately your eyes will be glued to the screen until, just when you think you've seen everything, Chinatown pulls a couple more twists out of its hat that will leave you stunned, right to the very end.",
408,1 December 2022,freethinkingworld,8, After Thoughts,"I like the whole setting for this film and just the overall vibe of it! It had the grimey feel I wanted from a Detective film and I loved every minute of it! I also thought the mystery aspect was great and I kept switching who I thought did it all the time. Also Jack Nicholson did an amazing acting job in the role! 👏👏👏👏 Bravo! Jack Nicholson is usually a very hit or miss actor for me, not that he ever does a bad job or anything, I just sometimes feel like he is playing the same character all the time. But not in this role, he was outstanding and was a genuine diamond in the rough and I totally bought it! And I just truly have a new respect for him. The only thing that hangs me up, that I had no idea or even heard about going into this was the ending. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad thing, it's just something I will have to think on to see if my rating for thus film will change. I love the artistic point, it just came as a blast from left field, and will have me thinking for a while.",

When you realize how important it is to have the best script and dialogue with strong character actors...you'll understand why 'Chinatown' is a must see for any film director, writer, film lover, and actor.
Although it's remembered as a Jack Nicholson vehicle..check out the amazing performance by Faye Dunaway, or the sinister superb performance of John Huston.

411,15 February 2023,johnspringer-95440,10, Cynical But Satisfying,The defining neo noir features superlative direction and excellent performances from a cast comprised of 'Hollywood royalty' back when that term still had positive connotations about cinematic talent. The script is as close to flawless as you're likely to find. It's dense and it requires your attention without becoming muddled or confusing. Chinatown is deeply cynical but it isn't self-consciously dour. The distinction is critical because whereas the latter would simply be maudlin and depressing the the former allows the film to be entertaining all the way up to a climax that's both gutting and inevitable.,
412,19 January 1999,btu,10, Probably the greatest movie from the '70's. Bringing together a great script with the best cast Hollywood had at the time.,"This motion picture brought together a great script by Robert Town, a great cast lead by Jack Nicholson and great directing  by Roman Polanski. The movie is set in Los Angeles in the late 1930's and filmed in the film noir style that made movies like The Maltese Falcon and Out of the Past great films. The key difference is that Chinatown is in color adding to its richness in photography by cinematographer John Alonzo and its spectacular music score by Jerry Goldsmith. My favorite part of the movie is John Hustons portrayal of Noah Cross. Mr. Huston was born to play this part bringing his tough no nonsense attitude and giving it to Noah Cross making this character the most mysterious of the cast. ""You may think you know what your dealing with but believe me you don't"", Noah Cross tells Mr. Gittes at their first meeting adding to this mystery that Mr. Huston brings to his charecter every time he is on screen. This film is one of those films that you will see over and over and enjoying it each time. It's a timeless work of art that only gets better with time.",

How about 1974's CHINATOWN? In my opinion, this is among the best noir films of all time, with those mentioned before. CHINATOWN is a nearly perfect film. The screenplay, by master of the medium Robert Towne is, in my opinion, the best ever written. It is so full of detail, characterization, plot, tone, style, and overall punch, and the fact that it is flawles makes it the best ever written.

415,28 April 2003,Blade_Le_Flambeur,9, A beautiful trip to the land of mystery noir,"In Roman Polanski's Chinatown, inspector J.J. Gittes is sucked into a world of scandal and mystery, where nothing is as it seems and everything is connected. Set in 1940's L.A., Chinatown takes mystery noir and turns into into a beautiful masterpiece. Surprisingly it is compared by many to the 1997 feature L.A. Confidential, who also say that they are alike. I find this difficult to believe, because Chinatown is more of a mystery noir while L.A. Confidential is more of a thriller. The performances in Chinatown are first- rate, with immensley deep performances by Jack Nicholson and Fay Dunaway. Both were nominated for their roles, and they both deserved to win. An honorable mention is John Huston as Noah Cross, a mysterious man who has more involvement then seen. It's not easy to like Jack Nicholson's character; he is snoopy and sly, and will do whatever it takes to get information. However, the viewer can easily understand him for he is sucked into this world without warning. The script by Robert Towne won Best Original Screenplay, which it deserved very much because of the absolute brilliance and originality. There is not one excessive line in this film, or really an excessive scene. Roman Polanski too this excellent script and turned it into pure brilliance, also high notes for pushing the cast members. The photography is interesting, but there isn't much of 50's shown in this picture, it's much more involved in the storyline then the setting. The only real flaw of this film is that it gets a bit slow and boring, but it doesn't hurt it much from being the masterpiece it is. One of the top ten films of all time. 9.75/10",

The characters are absolutely believable with real motives and real thoughts in their minds. It is one of the rare times in movie experience where the viewer is able to get a glimpse of what the characters are thinking.

I will allow that the film is set against a dark and slightly horrific background and that some people find that type of movie compelling. But so far I've sat through Five Easy Pieces, Klute, Chinatown and Midnight Cowboy and I cannot even begin to understand the fascination with these movies - the dialog in these movies is HORRIBLE and TOTALLY UNREALISTIC - and in some cases not even logical. The story-lines unrealistic, if they exist at all. I found myself falling asleep at 1:00 in the afternoon. I actually commented to my wife ""Does This Thing Ever End?"". Slow-paced, tacky, outdated, boring. JaAt 1:50 of the movie I said ""I hope this movie ends with someone dropping a bomb on all of them"".

He reminds me somewhat of Hannibal Lectur, he's not everywhere throughout the film but he's still there hurting people in a very strange (and nasty) way.

Like dominoes there's satisfaction with each fall but there's a doubt and a fear that there could be a mistake which would throw the entire course off balance.

Everything in this movie is excellent; the writing is the best I have ever seen and I totally believed that it was the prewar 1940's. All of the characters are believable and the story line is great, not to mention the great musical score. This movie has a plethora of famous quotes such as when Gittes is at Mrs.Mulwray's home, Mrs.Mulwray asks Jake what he use to do working for the District Atourney, Gittes replies with, ""As little as possible."" All of the clothes, sets, and cars and any other items on screen point to the times of the 1940's. The film does a good job of sending out a message: Things may be very complicated and no matter how hard you try, you just won't understand them. ""Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown.""

People, give your head a shake....in 1937, unfortunately, this is the way the average American regarded a person of Chinese heritage. As uncomfortable as it may be, it is called historical accuracy. To me, taking out the references to the Chinese in this film would be like removing deregatory references towards blacks in ""Malcolm X"" This is another one of those great films of the 70's that requires an attention span which more than half of the American population does not possess.

The plot is simply fascinating -- one cannot help but to be enthralled by the constantly unwravelling story.  Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, and John Huston all give brilliant performances which complement the flawless screenplay (which won an acadmey award, unlike the film itself, which lost to the sequel to ""The Godfather"").  The noir style of this film is not simply a throwback to the classics of the 1930s and 40s; it is noir at its best, something to be enjoyed on its own.  I've read some comments here by people who are afraid that today's generation will find this movie slow-moving or boring; I have to disagree with this assertion, as I, at the age of 18, was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time.

This is not the usual shamus movie. I was left with the impression that John Huston's character, although wounded and hurt, would get off legally because the last scene plays in Chinatown, where anyone with money and influence can beat any legal rap.

It took a brazenly ambitious concept--a film noir in color--and pulled it off masterfully, managing to incorporate sunlight into the noir milieu and creating a palette that reflected the parched, burned-out atmosphere.  And unlike many old noirs, it does not compromise its mood with a ridiculous happy ending, but rather one that completes its gloomy, desperate vision in a setting that makes perfect thematic sense.

Director Polanski was also lucky enough to catch Jack Nicholson in his prime; he is perfectly cast as slimy and yet vulnerable Jack Gittes. Faye Dunaway is also superb. She was in her prime too, with Bonnie and Clyde behind and Network yet to come.

For Faye Dunaway, this with without a doubt her best performance. The key however is John Huston. His performance in this movie is astonishing. Huston injects his character with such an evil menace that every time he came on the screen you have to hold your breath. John Huston deserved an Oscar nomination for his performance in this movie. His villian in this is right on par with Angela Lansbury's in ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" Dennis Hopper's in ""Blue Velvet"" and Anthony Hopkins' in ""The Silence of The Lambs.""

This is also one of the few films that has the power to genuinely shock as the final layers of truth are exposed.",

Polanski manages to not only capture the spirit and feel, to say nothing of the look, of film noir movies, but also to make a film noir movie that is riveting and exciting in its own right, about thirty years after the Golden Age of that particular genre. Every scene here is a work of art, every nuance is thrilling, nothing is neglected. You get the eerie feeling of mystery, the milieu and ambience of the thirties, the odd characters and much more. Jack Nicholson's acting here is outstanding. Most of the time he doesn't have to say anything, really. By sheer acting he manages to convey every feeling. Every disappointment, every agony, every curiosity, every witticism. After having seen this movie, you are left with a tremendously exhilarating feeling that you have really seen something special. The movie remains a reliable and wonderful friend. Chinatown richly deserves the rating ""10"" that I have given it. See it if you haven't already!!! And even if you have, it's always a thrill to revisit its world of magic from time to time.",

He knows he's been lied to and Dunaway enters the car, startled by his presence. He asks for the keys. She acts surprised. He says, ""It's either that or you drive to the police yourself...""

We get an ending that benefits the general storyline, no matter how much of a downer it is for the audience. The movie's a first-rate noir that makes a lasting impression. The story line was brilliant, it kept you on the edge of your seat the whole entire time. The cinematography was so well done, the use of lighting and camera angles had this awesome effect that drew you in and set the tone for every scene.

I truly can't find any flaws with it, and although the story can be a bit confusing for first time viewers, it gets better with every repeated viewing.  If the Devil exists and I wind up in Hell when I die, I would definitely expect him to be in the guise of Noah Cross.  He is the most vile screen villain I can recall; even Tommy Udo from Kiss of Death would have difficulty matching up to him in the meanness category.  The final scene of the movie matches up with any other in movie history - ""C'mon Jake, it's Chinatown"".  Existential film noir at it's finest.  Don't bother with the sequel if you love this movie.  I saw a double feature of Chinatown and The Two Jakes at the New Beverly in Hollywood - big mistake!  LA Confidential is a more true sequel, although they chickened out and gave it a happy ending.",

It made the movie seem more dramatic. The acting wasn't all that great, I feel like the actual plot is what they were trying to portray more than the characters. It was a pretty socially risky plot, too. It wasn't unheard of having a male commit fidelity but a woman was another story. On top of that, she hired someone to watch him which a woman would have never done in that time period. I felt like the meaning behind it was that it takes two to make mistakes in marriages and commit infidelity.

Even though every film noir I had seen before this was in black and white, this film had the same undeniable feel of a classic film noir. In the sense of a mysterious woman and underlying crime. Jack Nicholson played the perfect bold role of a private detective while also being soft spoken to an extent. I thought the setting/scenery was beautiful in this film, Being set in Los Angeles, California, some of the desert/mountain views were breath taking. In terms of film elements, Chinatown was quite unique. While most of the film was in color, the opening scene was in black and white as well as yellow tinted scenes throughout to indicate past events. Overall I thought this film was significant because of the countless elements to make this the last great film noir.",

But, I honestly think the plot was a tiny bit dry. Yes, it's a mystery with lots of twists and turns and surprises. But after a while it begins to feel a bit like a scandal within a scandal within another scandal (scandal-ception?) There was no real tension, and it seemed like they were just adding plot details to draw it out. There was also a little bit too much dialogue for my tastes. That being said, I also appreciated that it wasn't paced like a typical ""murder mystery,"" and the way in which it unfolded was slightly more lifelike. What was redeeming for me was the ending (which a lot of people hate apparently). The characters have been on this wild goose chase, only to have it not play out in their favor. Which I think has to be a VERY conscious decision to do, because it's not what's expected and therefore under scrutiny. I think it fits here though, especially since the previous parts of the film didn't give you the feeling something bad was going to happen—it seemed like Jake would prevail. A lot of the time, films with an ""unhappy"" ending have a pessimistic tone throughout so it's almost as if you expect it. ",

This film is also in the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for films that are ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."" The thing that I liked the most about this film, and found the most interesting was the fact that everything that happened took place through the main characters eyes. For instance, when he comes unconscious, the screen goes black and then fades back when he awakens.

Even though extramarital affairs are the main subject of this movie nudity isn't relied on to portray that even though nudity was becoming much more popular during this time period.

482,13 May 2006,rivendell1,10, Couple of interesting points,"I once took a class in screen writing in Hollywood and there was general agreement that this was the best screenplay ever written. A couple of trivia points that may be of some interest. There was a great scene with the wonderful actor Royal Dano that for reasons never made clear Polanski edited out at the last minute. It happened just before Gittes goes in search of the Orange groves in the valley. That was a mistake by Polanski. There was a scene in the script in which Gittes is in an airplane flying to meet Noah Cross for the first time where the pilot actually tells Gittes that there was a rumor that Cross had an incestuous relationship with his daughter. BIG mistake by R. Towne to foreshadow like that and the right decision by Polanski to cut it out. Also, Polanski and Faye Dunaway absolutely despised each other on the set culminating in the now famous confrontation with Polanski actually dropping his pants and pissing on her script notes in front of her. Just a great movie all around!",

486,3 December 2003,Travis69,10, Chinatown review,"`Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown!' Long before The Pianist, Roman Polanski's other classic was Chinatown, a film based on a place with its own rules, logic and morality. Unfortunately for private investigator Jake Gittes (who else but Jack Nicholson), Chinatown is a place where ghosts have advised him to do `as little as possible'; yet that technique is almost unfeasible when emotions are thrown into the mix. Like Harry Caul from the other great film paranoia-noir of 1974, The Conversation, Jake involves himself too heavily in one case and winds up in the same place with no sanity for human nature. As in most films Chinatown ends where it begins. This time, it just happens to begin in the back-story.",

The movie involves many different aspects that can come off as confusing to the viewer but comes all together in the end. there are some shocking pieces of the story that come about and can leave the audience stunned but the story builds to allow the viewer to thinks like a detective themselves to figure out what was going on. Director Roman Polanski was nominated for best director for his ability to create a movie that is able to involve a real life problem and incorporate it into a mysterious and gripping story.,

Trumpets playing slowly as the main character, Jake 'J.J.' Gittes (Jack Nicholson), is revealed to us. As an ex-police officer, Jake now deals purely in private investigation, a real 'slooth' for hire, and he is incredibly good at what he does. The movie is based around the murder of a Los Angeles Water and Power Works Chief Engineer, and how water is the root of life and social power to the City of Los Angeles. Although the movie is technically a murder mystery, there is a real underlining theme of how people with power will do anything to keep that power, and when the line should be drawn between morals and greed.",

Many characters felt out of their minds and peculiar. The reference to the curse of Chinatown made me think that the whole thing had happened once before. When I realized at the end that it wasn't the case, I started thinking of the movie as a whole. I felt the movie was very neatly put together with bits and pieces of the puzzle being shared with the viewer as the plot thickens and goes deep. I did feel that the movie invoked the Deus Ex Machina some time towards the end when the plot had become too full of irrelevant details. The character of Mrs.Mullway is intriguing and lends the story an unpredictable touch that it needs every now and then.

That is what I love about his work. I loved the settings and costumes too.

Evans, either by design or serendipity, brought together Robert Towne's superb screenplay and Roman Polanski's confident and polished direction to create a magnificently accomplished tale of avarice and treachery.

Every scene feels necessary, as the film also never felt all too predictable, and has an ending that is par for the course of this excellent film , but in the end, defeating. The devastation felt at the end is truly awful, and is one of the best endings of a movie ever (personal opinion). Whatever else is mentioned about the film has already been said enough, but generally, every aspect and facet the movie touches is done with true excellence. Touching on dishonesty, apathy in the face of evil, and helplessness, ""Chinatown"" does everything and more to develop its themes and messages that delivers, as stated, one of the greatest movies of the 70s, and in fact, ever.

Maybe I just wanted to decipher it, maybe it was Gittes' smart mouth, maybe it was that massive bandage keeping his nose together. After about 20, god knows, how many watches I finally got it...this is possibly the best pastiche ever made! ",

The plot revolves around a private detective who is approached by a woman to investigate her husband, because she thinks that he is cheating. As the movie goes on, the plot gets very intricate and involves murder, lies, money and so on.",

517,29 June 2008,axlrose1504,10, One word..... Wow!,"1974 the year of The Godfather's 2nd instalment which pretty much was the greatest film of that year but....... Also in the running for best picture that year was Polanski's finest moment in film history, Chinatown. Noir had pretty much had its run in the late 40's and 50's, the 60's decade was the decade of Disney's invasion of seminal kids films but the 1970's which i regard has the greatest decade in Hollywood history we where brought within that decade, Jaws, The first two (and best) Godfather films, Dog Day Afternoon,Taxi Driver, A Clockwork Orange,Star Wars, Dirty Harry, this was the decade of the blockbuster. Noir had no place in this decade but Roman Polanski defied what the audience were seeking by bringing them his most memorable film. Jack Nicholson played Jake Gittes, a private investigator hired by a one Mrs Mulwray to spy on her husband who she suspects is having an affair, on taking on this case Gittes begins to delve into a dark secret behind LA's unexplainable draught which he traces back to a deal made within the city's Water and Power. This dark and beautifully shot film created a tone of intensity between its actors and its audience Polanski was able to give his audience the sense that we knew what Gittes was after before delivering us the shocking twist at the end which for if you haven't seen this film i will not mention. Nicholson shines in this dark film which is up there with his greatest work such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and The Shining and a memorable role for acting legend John Huston as the retired owner of water and power Noah Cross. Masterfully shot, beautifully written, terrifically acted and shocking until the closing credits by far one of the greatest surviving films of the 70's and gave the dying noir genre a shot in the arm. ",
518,21 December 2006,frank-w,9, One of the finest movies made,"I thought that Nicholson slapping Dunaway around when he was questioning her was a bit over the top, in view of all their previous meetings. Generally, though, all the casting was excellent. Faye Dunaway gave one of her greatest performances. Likewise for John Houston - I particularly liked his references to Nicholson as ""Mr. Gitts"". Roman Polanski was a most convincing villain. It's a movie that will stand the test of time, despite its many anachronisms; the sheer power of the settings and performances carries it along. The depictions of Chinatown and the willingness of the police to use their weapons would not hold water today.",

521,24 April 2020,russnagle,10, The Greatest,"This movie is one of the greatest films made in the 1970s by Hollywood. It's the kind of film they dont make anymore - intelligent, suspenseful, brilliantly acted and directed and unique. Robert Towne's screenplay is known as one of the best ever written. I juyst love this movie and watch it at least once a year. Nicholson is perfect as are the rest of the cast. This is my favorite Polanski film as well. It's like magic in a bottle. They caught something when they made this. Will we ever see original films on this scale again? Will we ever see anything as original as the Beatles again? I hope so, yet I keep waiting.",
522,16 June 2001,thebainz,10," Flawless, American cinema at its best.",This movie is nigh on flawless. The script is challenging yet on repeated viewings rewarding. John Huston matches any screen villain before or since and the convoluted plot is evocative of Chandler. Typical of the pre-Star Wars era and representative of early seventies Hollywood cinema which challenged the intellect as much as any contemporary European cinema.,
523,23 December 2018,MarineE9,9," Almost pure, riviting action oriented in word and scenery","This movie looks like the 1930s. Perfect detail to wardrobe and hairstyles. The banter between that arrogant JJ and his underworld buddies, cop friends and damaged clients is pure music to my ears. I love this color Film Noire. I can't think of one character who does not produce a memorable presence. Jack as JJ is perfect for the role and I can't give you the name of anyone who would try and reprise this role, it would be impossible. He owns it. Just yesterday, watched it with my adult son and that was my first time seeing it since 1974. How is it that I still knew the most memorable lines? Jack as JJ and his former partner, Police Lt. Lou had some great scenes. I think you just need to watch this excellent movie and let it rumble around your head like it did to mine last night. Still laughing about the ""midget"" line at the reservoir scene.",
524,19 May 2023,TheBrownees,10, One of the Greatest Movies Ever Made and My Personal Favorite.,"Robert Towne based his masterful screenplay on the William Mulholland - Owens Valley - Los Angeles Aqueduct events of the early teens - the LA Aqueduct was completed in 1913 emptying into the Van Norman dam in the northern part of San Fernando Valley - and Towne transported those events forward in time to 1937. To a time when the LA on film is recognizable as the LA of the seventies and the LA of today. Roman Polanski, like Hitchcock, was a great director who was born to work in Hollywood. A genius behind the camera, when he was working with the greatest technicians on the planet as he was here - cinematographer John A. Alonzo lovingly using a palette of yellows and browns in the desert heat, Richard Sylbert's production design, Anthea Sylbert's costumes, and Sam O'Steen's editing - he captured the FEEL of LA better than anyone before or sense. Having experienced some horrific personal tragedies he gave the film a preordained feeling of doom and melancholy and, in the process, gave us the greatest color Film Noir.",

526,3 March 2012,gpt-23,8, Nicholson at his finest!,"In Chinatown, inspector J.J. Gittes is sucked into a world of scandal and mystery, where nothing is as it seems and everything is connected. Set in 1940's L.A., Chinatown takes mystery noir and turns into into a beautiful masterpiece. Surprisingly it is compared by many to the 1997 feature L.A. Confidential, who also say that they are alike. I find this difficult to believe, because Chinatown is more of a mystery noir while L.A. Confidential is more of a thriller. The performances in Chinatown are first- rate, with immensely deep performances by Jack Nicholson and Fay Dunaway. Both were nominated for their roles, and they both deserved to win. An honorable mention is John Huston as Noah Cross, a mysterious man who has more involvement then seen. It's not easy to like Jack Nicholson's character; he is snoopy and sly, and will do whatever it takes to get information. However, the viewer can easily understand him for he is sucked into this world without warning. The script by Robert Towne won Best Original Screenplay, which it deserved very much because of the absolute brilliance and originality. There is not one excessive line in this film, or really an excessive scene. Roman Polanski too this excellent script and turned it into pure brilliance, also high notes for pushing the cast members. The photography is interesting, but there isn't much of 50's shown in this picture, it's much more involved in the storyline then the setting. The only real flaw of this film is that it gets a bit slow and boring, but it doesn't hurt it much from being the masterpiece it is.",

Between the great soundtrack, the beautiful time-period-perfect sets, the complicated but tight plot, this was, I was certain, the best movie I'd ever seen.  Twenty-seven  years later that still holds true.  I have seen this movie not less than 300 times.  It's well beyond perfect. It mesmerizes everytime. Its lessons ring truer as life itself brings more parallel experiences to one's attention as the decades roll by. Superior!",

When I first rented it I had no expectations of how good it would be. First of all, Jack Nicholson is one of the best actors of all time in my opinion. Also with Roman Polanski directing this is, it's a ""can't go wrong"" movie. Strong screen writing makes this movie fast-paced, intriguing and humorous. All the good qualities of a great movie. It's just a really well done crime thriller that keeps you guessing up until the final scene. This is Nicholson and Polanski's finest work. Trust me - if you're a movie buff you must watch this movie. You will not be let down. Guaranteed.",
532,19 October 2005,ScatlinSkag2,10, For misguided viewers,"I would like to suggest to anyone confused or not impressed with the masterpiece witch is ""Chinatown"" A movie such as ""Chinatown"" is a film that screams for viewers to observe its contents more than once. No person, movie buff of not, is going to take in whole the essence of this film based upon one viewing. There is so much complication in this film that the first viewing will result only in the knowledge of the plot and mystery behind it. After you have a grasp on what the heck is going on behind the lies and schemes of the characters is when you can take in mind the essence and pure brilliance of this classic. I urge people who have not taken advantage of really trying to understand this film to do so immediately, especially if you liked it but are confused on many issues of the film. If not, forget about it, it's only Chinatown.",

A big TV is better than small, but there is a magical glow that comes from the dimly lit room and the projected image that draws you in, in a way that no glass trap can. (In my honest opinion) ",
534,25 February 2006,andykortman,10, the perfect movie,"Nobody ever hires Gittes to uncover the water scandal, yet this is what the whole movie is about. Noah Cross is the money that made Los Angeles possible, Evelyn and Catherine are L.A., Escobar and the police force are old morality, Gittes is the postmodern morality, Mulwray represents technology. Just like how Katherine is the unnatural product of Cross and his daughter, present L.A. is the unnatural product of money and the rape of Owens Valley. It used to be that traditional values could be relied upon to make it in the world. But just as Escobar's cronie killed Evelyn in the end, those values cannot comprehend modern moral challenges, such as those provided by the potential of modern technology. Gittes transcends the old morality and is able to name Cross's crime, in his face (this predawn scene is beautiful and done all in one shot). A more perfect script coupled with the perfect director, I can't think of.",
