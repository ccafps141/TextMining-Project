0,9 November 2004,Surecure,10, A fantastic and powerful film,"I was fortunate to see this film at the Toronto Film Festival. I had heard nothing about this film before I read up on it in the Fest guide and originally was going to see something else. But, the subway happened to shut down and I was not going to be able to see the film I originally intended. So, I decided to give this a try.",/
1,20 January 2014,planktonrules,10," Not surprisingly, you'll need to have some Kleenex nearby as you watch this film.","""Hotel Rwanda"" is an incredibly sad sort of film. After all, during 1994 between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people were murdered--mostly Tutsis hacked to death due to an insane tribal rivalry with the more numerous Hutus. Genocide is not pleasant viewing. However, the film is a bit easier to watch than it could be, as most of the scenes of the slaughter are pretty tame. This isn't really a complaint--it doesn't deny the killings but it also doesn't show a lot of hacked off limbs and bodies (though there are quite a few of the latter). I appreciate how the MPAA changed their minds and re-rated the film PG-13 instead of R, as R would seem to imply that it's not a film for a wide audience. Folks should see this film.",r

6,21 July 2005,lee_eisenberg,10, I heard Paul Rusesabagina speak at Lewis & Clark College.,"""Hotel Rwanda"" recreates the 1994 Rwandan Genocide in the same way that ""Schindler's List"" recreated the genocide against the Jews. The movie shows not only the massacre, but also how the international community did nothing to stop it.

9,8 July 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10," Powerful, gut-wrenching and compelling","Hotel Rwanda was one of those films I initially put off seeing for reasons I don't really know, but after seeing it that decision is one of those decisions that I've regretted as it turned out to be one of the better films I've seen in a while now. Hotel Rwanda is beautifully shot and the scenery is striking while still being authentic without being too clean. The story is always compelling and powerful, with plenty of gut-wrenching and poignant moments while never feeling preachy. The film is excellently directed and scripted too, while Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Pheonix and particularly Don Cheadle give superb acting performances. Overall, a truly fantastic film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",w
10,9 December 2004,Julia-Gefter,10, so powerful and amazing,"I have never been so touched by a movie. It was the hardest movie I have ever sat through but also the best. it's so easy to ignore human rights abuses if they are not happening to you or your family, but just because you ignore it, they are still happening. i hope this movie receives the praise it deserves. i am frustrated because nothing i can type can represent how powerful this movie is or how much it moved me. i can't comment on the amazing acting or cinematography or directing because the movie transported me. i did not think about the making of the movie but rather sat shocked and horrified and nauseated and inspired. there was the red cross agent. there were heroes and while human nature perverts and the thin veil of culture unravels, there is still good. i have to look at the good of the heroes in the movie and of the people that wrote the movie, and realize that going to the movies doesn't have to be about escapism. it can be about reality. this is a must-see, not because it will make you laugh but because it will make you think and feel.",2

12,19 March 2005,jotix100,10, A document for humanity,"The madness one sees in this brilliant film is hard to imagine, yet it occurred in Rwanda. Terry George, the director, captures those terrible days in Rwanda in his film ""Hotel Rwanda"". Mr. George has to be commended for bringing to the screen a detailed account of a country in chaos. Working with Keir Pearson on the screen play, the director presents us with the horrors of what the country lived during the holocaust that befell Rwanda.",6
13,28 February 2005,FilmOtaku,8, Excellent and emotionally devastating,"""Hotel Rwanda"" gives a first-hand account of the genocide that occurred between the two main tribes in Rwanda, the Hutus and the Tutsis. Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle) is the manager of a luxury hotel in the area that caters to the wealthy and to government figures. Outside of the gates of the resort, Tutsis are being killed by the Hutu militia, and though Paul (a Hutu) is married to Tatiana (Okonedo) (a Tutsi) for the sake of his family, he turns a blind eye until his in-laws disappear and the militia literally come to his doorstep demanding his cooperation and the surrender of his wife, children and neighbors. With the diplomacy that he has learned in his job he is able to barter with them, basically paying a great deal of money for the lives of his family and neighbors. Meanwhile, Col. Oliver (Nolte), who is with the United Nations, is trying to help the refugees and keep some semblance of order, but is forced to evacuate only the Caucasian residents of the hotel, leaving all of the Rwandans (both Tutsi and Hutus that are Tutsi sympathizers) to fend for themselves, which leads Paul to open the hotel to over 1,000 Tutsi refugees. There they try desperately to get out of the country, and ultimately, survive since the Hutu militia is now targeting any sympathizers as well.",7

Tutsis were slaughtered by Hutus simply because they were Tutsi, while the rest of the world was looking away. The way the United Nations acted here is portrayed by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), the only fictional person in the movie.",0
16,14 March 2005,The_Void,6," Not bad, but definitely a disappointment","Sentimental dramas are not my thing, but after the good reviews that Hotel Rwanda has been winning itself; I figured it has to be worth a go, and it was; but that's all it's worth. For a film that's supposed to 'stay with you' and 'leave an impact'; Hotel Rwanda is a huge disappointment. There isn't much in this film that wouldn't be able to be took from a documentary on the subject of the plight of Rwanda; but it has to be said, in spite of this, that Hotel Rwanda balances it's story with the human drama rather well, as not too much time is ever spent on either. The film can easily be likened to a disaster movie, as it gives two sides of a story - one being a terrible happening and the other being the effect on the people involved. This likeness continues when you come to realise that the protagonists are totally uninvolving characters and the only reason that the film gives you for feeling for them is the fact that they're the leads. Hotel Rwanda will get praise from some people because it's based on a true story, but this film fan isn't as easily impressed as many evidently are.",9

21,10 June 2006,Lady_Targaryen,9," When the world closed its eyes, he opened his arms.","''Hotel Rwanda'''is a very powerful and sad story showing the atrocities that happened in Rwanda in 1994,where almost 1 million people were killed in 100 days. The division of two groups, the tutsis and the hutus,made Rwanda's peace something to dream about. We see that all started when the Belgians gave power to the tustsis, because they had a fair skin and a complexion much more similar of the Europeans then the hutus. Even measuring the noses was a normal thing to do. Years after, the Hutus were the ones who stayed with the power and they wanted revenge by smashing the tutsis.",f
22,2 November 2005,michaelRokeefe,8, Astounding as it is awesome.,"This movie deserves every accolade thrown its way. Don Cheadle probably has never been better. Based on an event that seemed to escape the eyes of the rest of the world. Some of the worst atrocities of the twentieth century was like a rancid belch in the central African nation of Rwanda. In spite of peace talks between the Hutus and Tutsis; the Hutus militia broke the pact and started killing Tutsis on sight. Almost one million people were brutally murdered in their homes, in the street at will. In the middle of the madness, an ordinary hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina(Cheadle)summoned the courage to actually save 1,268 refugees by hiding them in the four star hotel he managed. HOTEL RWANDA is a testament to Paul's devotion and love for his family and mankind. Also in this modern day classic: Mosa Kaiser, Joaquin Phoenix, Nick Nolte, Fana Mokoena, Mabutho 'Kid' Sithole, Kgomotso Seitshohlo, Simo Mogwaza and Hakeem Kae-Kazim. This is an outstanding motion picture and worth every minute of the the 2 hour 2 minutes running time. Kudos to writer and director Terry George.",_
23,12 February 2005,druss44121-1,8, More than just an African 'Schindler's List',"Based on the 1994 genocide between the African ""tribes"" of the Hutu's and the Tutsi's, Hotel Rwanda has gotten decidedly mixed reviews. Before seeing the film, I was a little surprised since such subject matter alone is usually powerful enough to lead a film to critical acclaim. After seeing the film, though, I was incredibly surprised, as this is one of the most powerful and harrowing films I've seen in a year. It moved me in a way most films fail to do.",=
24,29 January 2005,ferguson-6,9, There's always room,"Greetings again from the darkness. Don Cheadle's Academy Award nomination for Hotel Rwanda is a well deserved and a wonderful thing. Hopefully it will encourage even more to see director Terry George's incredibly moving tale of the 1994 Rwanda crisis between the Tutsis and the Hutu. As with Schindler's List, nothing is more powerful than a real life hero. Paul Rusesabagina is a real life hero. With the slaughter of nearly a million right outside his front gate, Paul R gave refuge to nearly 1000 who surely would have died. The tour de force by Cheadle is with his divergent performance from the elegant Hotel manager to the smooth negotiator to the passionate husband, parent and humanist. This man cares about people and what is right. Although, Nick Nolte's performance was slightly askew, the movie is well paced and heartfelt and should be seen by many. Very powerful.",t
25,18 April 2005,howard.schumann,9, A moving and powerful film,"Just over ten years ago, Rwanda, a former Belgian colony the size of Vermont, became a horrific killing field, the result of ethnic, social, and political hatred between the majority Hutus and the rival Tutsis, the former ruling elite who ran the country for the Belgians and treated the Hutu as second class citizens. The Washington Post reported ""how the heads and limbs of victims were sorted and piled neatly, a bone-chilling order in the midst of chaos that harked back to the Holocaust."" The massacre that claimed over one million lives was triggered by the still unsolved assassination of Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana, whose plane was gunned down by missiles on his return from a conference in Dar-es Salam. Senior Hutu leaders used the downing of the plane as an excuse to exterminate Tutsis and moderate Hutus. While the UN maintained a peacekeeping presence they did not intervene, nor did the U.S., France, Belgium or other Western powers who had the power to stop it.",t
26,5 March 2005,vertigo_14,10, This IS the Best Picture of 2004 (spoilers),"As governments around the world ignore the atrocities against the Sudanese in Darfur, this movie should have you screaming for something to be done to save them! 'The Hotel Rwanda' should be seen by all, and forgotten by none. ",_
27,23 January 2005,jessie-39,10, Don Cheadle...Finally will get his calling. Wow!,"As one who feels that there is ""no best performance"" for the Oscars but rather, everyone who is nominated is a ""best performance"". How can you possibly compare any one performance against another when the movies and stories are totally different. We loved many movies this year and feel they are worthy of nominations. We have already been rewarded by seeing that Natalie Portman and Clive Owens were honored by the foreign Press for a movie that we loved, but understood some would find it abhorrent. The line is drawn in the sand by Don Cheadle who we have always liked in every role he has played. He has been relegated the usual stereotypical roles for Black actors and it must be frustrating for him and the handful of very talented black actors and actresses who just don't get the great roles. Don Cheadle sets himself apart from every single actor in any movie of 2004. It is done by simply providing the best acting role in a movie about ""real events"". It makes us all ashamed of the fact that we were frozen to the TV watching OJ Simpson at the time that all of this took place. What a disgrace to us. As usual the world stood still and did nothing as in the Holocaust and the few other cases of genocide. The French true to their colors did nothing when they could have and should been first on the site. The English and Americans turned their backs as did the UN. Cheadle brings us to tears and cheers in this fascinating story of ""one man"" who defies the odds against genocide of his own people. He is an outstanding actor and he surely deserves not only the nomination but the win as well. True, Leo was great as Hughes, Sideways is still something I cannot understand as to what the hub bub is about, Clint and Morgan were superb in Million Dollar baby, but none come close to Cheadle in this spectacular role of a lifetime. Bravo to Cheadle and those who had the guts to make this movie. Everyone from 8 to 108 should be required to see this movie as much if not equal to Schindlers List.",u
28,26 January 2005,judywalker2,10, I couldn't stop crying,"I almost didn't go see this movie. It's so hard for me to sit through things like this. It is very, very good, but you can only see it once if you have a heart or a soul. You can only go through the experience one time because you can't do it again, at least I can't. Don Cheadle was exceptional. Nick Nolte and Jaoquin Phoenix had very difficult roles. I was also happy to see Jean Reno has the hotel president. The good people anguished and the bad people schemed. The woman who played Don Cheadle's wife was also very good I really felt her fear. I agree with the critics that this movie had a message without being preachy. It should teach us a lesson, but I know the world won't listen.",r
29,27 March 2005,kergillian,10, Welcome to the wonderful world of European colonization.,"Somalia, Ethiopia/Eritrea, Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Congo, Sudan, Algeria, Nigeria, Tunisia - and Rwanda...what do all of these African counties have in common? They're countries torn apart by civil war, where millions have been slaughtered and millions more have been maimed, raped, beaten, tortured, threatened, displaced, and, most importantly, ignored by the rest of the world. And the main reason for the nightmare that Africa has become? Europe colonized Africa and divided it along new territorial lines, splitting tribes and clans into pieces, and forcing rivals and foreigners into the same territories. The entire Rwandan genocide is namely due to the Belgians, who basically handpicked certain Rwandans and called them Hutus, and called the others Tutsis, all arbitrarily, then left the country and power to the Hutus, creating a power struggle between two 'tribes' who were really the SAME PEOPLE.",v
30,15 April 2005,rps-2,7, Excellent except for one thing,"It's difficult to imagine the inhumanity and horror of the Rwandan genocide. Yet this film does a good job of conveying it without resorting to excess gore. It also leavens the horror with well timed moments of humour or tenderness. From all accounts it is factually correct. Why then did they not portray Gen. Romeo Dallaire as himself instead of inserting some trumped up fictional character played most unsuitably by Nick Nolte wearing a Canadian flag on his shirt? This detracts from the film and angers Canadians. Most of us regard Dalaire as a compassionate, highly principled hero who was betrayed by the UN. (Read his book, ""Shake Hands With The Devil."") The movie tells a terrible story very well. But eliminating Gen. Dalaire is a little like eliminating Eisenhower from ""The Longest Day"" (Dalaire, incidentally, just recently was appointed to the Canadian Senate.)",
31,1 May 2005,esteban1747,8, Hutu- Tutsi war in Rwanda,"Although I visited Rwanda shortly before the war I do not remember 1000 colins hotel in Kigali. Certainly there was a tragedy in this tiny African country where brothers- I do not make any differentiation between tall Tutsi minority and somewhat small Hutu majority - were fighting each other. Probably all this hate started at the time of colonialism when the Tutsi were more favored by the Belgians, and once the country got the independence, a Tutsi kingdom was established with discrimation over Hutu population, which lasted not for long. The Hutu defeated the Tutsi and came to power with a Republic that continued the discrimination this time against Tutsi. In that country was compulsory for everyone to have the ethnic indication in the identity card. The film is only touching the final phase of the war between Tutsi guerrilla who was coming from the North of the country and the Hutu extremists, who were able to kill its own president, as it is shown in the film, just because he signed in Nairobi a peace agreement. In the film one can see how Hutus were killing innocent Tutsi population, and how international community was weakly reacting to this mass assassination. Unfortunately, it did not show how many Hutu families were coming from the North to Kigali. The film finished with the victory of Tutsi, but was it the end of this war? Not at all, Hutu escaped to Goma in the neighboring Congo, and many of them died again in war established between both groups, but no in their land. So if Hollywood makes several sequels of non sense films as ""Terminator"", ""Die Hard"" and others, it would be wise to prepare a sequel of ""Rwanda Hotel"" showing what happened after the Tutsi conquered Kigali, and how this confrontation finished, or perhaps to prepare a similar film of the tragedy in neighboring Burundi, where the same groups are still fighting. Don Cheadle acted very well but somewhat different to the role he played in the film ""Rosewood"". In ""Hotel Rwanda"" he was a Hutu but married to a Tutsi lady and with several children, always looking for peace and understanding.",
32,6 February 2005,magicalmouse,10, Who says you have to see the violence to feel its power ?,"I had wanted to see this film from the moment I saw a snippet about it on BBC America. It was so powerful. It is difficult to talk about a film like this and use terms like what a great movie etc.. since it is about such a horrific event and a movie is a form of entertainment. I was caught up in the film right from the start, Don Cheadle made this role his own, every scene that he was in showed another angle another side of a man torn by so many things from what he knew to be right to what he knew in order to survive. It was his eyes that riveted me, each and every thought that he had as Paul was mirrored there - he was a man torn between so many things whether to just concern himself with his family or include his neighbors or the plight of strangers as well. I was so impressed also with the way he carried himself with such quiet dignity even while you knew that inside he must have been seething. He moved with such grace like a ballet dancer, even his fingers as they moved carried expression. I have always liked Mr. Cheadle in movies from his crazy turn in Devil in a Blue Dress to his great Brit part in Ocean's 11 and 12 but here he showed that he is by no means a lightweight. I can only hope that he has the opportunity to bring more of this talent to the screen. The rest of the cast was also superb, poor Nick Nolte always so powerful and breaking the rules and yet here unable to be a total rebel. You won't be disappointed with this film but you may walk out wondering how you could have helped, I know I did.",

Getting an 8.5 on IMDb and with 3 nominations, who who wouldn't want to see it? After I watched the film, I was pleased with what I saw. Don Cheadle played a wonderful performance as Paul Rusesabagina which earned Cheadle an Oscar nomination. The whole film actually reminded me of Schindler's List. The film is almost an identical twin of Schindler's List. Paul Rusesabagina is an Oskar Schindler type person. There the same people. The only thing different them is that there from different countries and are a different race. That's it. Overall, I liked Hotel Rwanda and I wasn't disappointed with the movie at all. There was a few slow parts to the film and some disturbing images that some viewers shouldn't see, but still an extremely powerful and great delivered performances that keeps this movie on it's heels. I recommend Hotel Rwanda.",
34,15 April 2005,MichaelMargetis,9, A Heartbreaking and Powerful Film About a Sensitive Subject,"I remember viewing many powerful and great movies last year, but something about 'Hotel Rwanda' stuck with me more than a lot of the others. 'Hotel Rwanda' is about the unbelievably sad and horrible incident that shook Rwanda to it's very foundations eleven years ago. It was April 1994 and almost no one could predict how nasty things would turn in a matter of days, and how many lives would be shattered. 'Hotel Rwanda' is the incredibly haunting and mesmerizing true story about one man who saved the life's of many of his fellow men during this period of Genocide and conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi citizens in Rwanda.",
35,13 February 2005,Gundersonm,10, Go see it!,"This is a terrific movie. The performances are spectacular, particularly Don Cheadle. He deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the hotel manager. The movie itself is much more important than just entertainment value. Most people aren't familiar with the horrific events in Rwanda in the 1990's, but they should be. We tend to think that genocide is something from the past that just doesn't happen in today's ""civil"" modern world. The true story behind this movie proves just the opposite. With all the focus on the Holocaust in World War II and all the talk about ""never letting it happen again,"" the world as a whole failed the people of Rwanda miserably just a few years ago. Everyone should see this movie, and learn a thing or two.",

Don Cheadle is very good in his part and is certainly worthy of nomination for an Academy Award, although I do not think his performance is as good as Leonard DeCaprio in the Aviator or Jamie Foxx who was Ray in the movie of the same name. The rest of the cast was very good in their parts, but I was disappointed in the bit part that Nick Nolte had in this fine picture. It is a shame to see some one so talented have his career go down the tubes because of a drinking problem. You have to have a strong stomach to watch this film but if you do you will be richly rewarded. We need more of the fine writing that is done in this film Hotel Rwanda.

43,26 February 2005,blueskybird16,10, Hotel Rwanda- very good,The movie was brilliant I had to see it for history class and I learned a lot. I wanted to see the movie Don Chedle is brilliant and is great at this particular role. His wife was great as well. This is a Must see movie. It will take you back to when Rwanda was in trouble and no one came to help except one guy who sheltered 1000 Tutsis and is a hero of Rwanda. It was sad though because it was a war and a lot of people died. Very educational and a good lesson to learn about peace and war.

46,14 April 2005,=G=,7, Rwanda's Schindler,"""Hotel Rwanda"" is a docudrama which tells the true story of a hotel manager (Cheadle) who, at his own peril, provided safe haven and protection for about 1000 refugees fleeing the Rwandan genocide of 1994 when 800,000 people were killed in a three month civil war. As is often the case with films which are built around compelling subjects such as holocausts, the import of the subject rubs off on the film elevating it's importance. Such is the case with ""Hotel Rwanda"", which is well crafted though it offers nothing new, conforms to the Hollywood playbook, and is probably slightly over-touted. The film spares the audience much of the bloody horror of the genocide with its PG-13 rating while doing a good job of building suspense and imparting a sense of the magnitude of the slaughter of innocents. Didactics are worked into the story so it is not difficult to follow even though the good and bad people are all black Rwandans. Those interested in the 1994 Rwandan genocide might also want to check out ""Sometimes in April"", a 2005 TV drama about the genocide which offers a somewhat broader perspective. (B)",

Don Cheadle does a reasonably OK job in his role as the messianic hero, although his face is usually stamped with helpless despair most of the time, a lot of time the fact that he is acting oozes through the lens a little too intensely. The film tap-dances around the horrific violence going on in the periphery, there is minimal on-screen violence shown. I was always waiting for the other shoe to drop and there be an actual depiction of the massacre going on. But, in the end, it was an attempt to shed some light on the Western world's indifference to the suffering of a split-off continent that is kept in captivity by the superpowers, kind of reminds me of the film ""Martyrs"", except in geographic terms, and applied to about 1 billion people in 54 countries. Now, the ridiculous thing about this movie, in my opinion, is how the main actor does this ""heroic"" thing for all the refugees, and yet ends up leaving his country and moving to Belgium, where it's all white and safe; again, the racial and economic split is created, but people swallow it easier since the actor is black, but the egregious disregard for human life is eternally stamped on the final message of this film... after all, who cares if 700,000 people lost their lives in this atrocious genocide, as long as the charismatic wealthy hero who knew all the right white guys comes out unscathed?",

As a human being first and as a Black person second, I was grief stricken to see how people from the same country and of the same color could relentlessly kill based upon a stamp on an I.D. card.

I couldn't possibly put to words how hard it was for me to hold back the tears for almost all of this movie(which I had to, due to the crowd I saw it with). Some of these tears weren't ones of sadness... they were at the beauty inherent in this person. This humanitarian. With everything to lose and nothing to gain, he selflessly helped people who had nothing to offer him in return. This movie reminded me of Schindler's List. However, as one of the other viewers pointed out to me, it's far easier to distance yourself from that... with all possible respect to any and all victims of it, World War 2 ended over 60 years ago. What this movie depicts is just over a decade ago. Genocide. Which took place while us in the West sat far away, comfortable and not affected by it... and we did nothing. No UN, no US forces, nothing. This film is incredibly touching. I can't see anyone watching and not being emotionally involved. The plot is well-written and intriguing. The pace is perfect. It never moved too slow or too fast. It started adequately slow, but moved intensely later on. The acting is all spot-on. The writing is excellent. A great film that everyone should see.

HOTEL RWANDA brings us the realization that there are many unreported acts of inhumanity that never reach our television or radio or newspapers. How many of us knew about this incident before now? But this well-crafted film is all the more poignant because it focuses on the quiet heroism of one elegant, enlightened hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) and his response to the Tutsi rebel uprising that resulted in the slaughter of over a million people, and for what reason? Going back to the time when Belgium 'owned' the country they divided the people into the Tutsi and Hutu categories based on skin color, nasal width and other absurd parameters.

Probably hardly any one cared about this atrocity that didn't have to go through it and I enjoyed the aspects of it showing why. Don Cheadle really was perfect for this role, and he put on a great performance here and it's one of those films he most definitely was worth being in. There is also a deep message, although it isn't a movie I would see multiple times or anything, but it was most definitely worth the time to see it at least once.

The movie shows the attitude of the world when mass killing is being done in Africa in the communal riots between Hutus and Tutsis. The protagonist, ""Paul"", who is a Hutu himself, is just like one of us for whom his family (which is Tutsi) is the most important. In the beginning he would do anything to save his family and would not even bother about his good neighbour. But slowly as he sees what is going around him he starts to realize. He takes up the responsibility of giving shelter to thousands of refugees in his hotel. He keeps giving bribes to the Tutsis leader. He even speaks to so many influential people around the world.

Throughout the film we seem to be taken through a somewhat digestible version of scenarios for western bourgeois audience.",

Cheadle plays the real-life role of hotel manager during the 1994 genocide of the Tutsi sect people by the Hutu sect majority. At the beginning of the film, before the killing starts, you learn that people were arbitrarily assigned to one of the two sects based on physical characteristics, which makes the killing even more unbelievable.",

It has moments of regularity , combined with terror and a bit of comedy to have a film based on true events directed and acting gave the viewer a real sense of what went Down in Rawanda, during the countries genocide & civil war. If you like films based on real people and real events this movie is a must see.The movie does a great job of portraying a real man in Rawanda who helped both Hutu and Tutsi's alike, often putting his own life on the line for others. A very heroic man, portrayed by Cheadle who did the best acting job of his career! I give it 9 stars! Check it out if you have not seen it!

He is one of the best actors in the film business by far yet he is never mentioned with the other top names. I really couldn't take my eyes of Cheadle when I watched this. The emotion and presence he carries on the screen is phenomenal. I saw this film in theaters and loved it. This was an incredibly moving film that really opens your eyes to whats going on in places outside the US. What was done to the people in Rwanda is horrifying and deserves to be shared with the rest of the world. Thats the beautiful thing about movies: they help everyday people to get a glimpse of hardships people face in other places that we will never experience or fully understand.

102,5 February 2009,jboothmillard,7, Hotel Rwanda,"I had seen a little bit of this film in college, and of course I knew the lead actor, so I was very eager to see it. Based on true events, this film is set in Rwanda during the historical genocide (deliberate and systematic extermination of national, racial, political, or cultural groups), a civil war between the Hutu and Tutsi peoples. The protagonist caught in the situation is real life hero, manager of Sabena Hôtel Des Mille Collines, Paul Rusesabagina (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Don Cheadle) - Hutu, along with wife Tatiana (Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls' Oscar nominated Sophie Okonedo) - Tutsi, and their children. Paul saw his responsibility to save as many people as he could, the majority being Tutsis, by sheltering them in his hotel, and bribing (with money and alcohol) police for protection. In the end, even after being taken out of the hotel, the UN Peacekeeping forces, led by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), convoy them to reach safety behind Tutsi rebel lines; Paul managed to save 1,200 refugees. Also starring an underused Joaquin Phoenix as Jack Daglish, Desmond Dube as Dube, David O'Hara as David, Cara Seymour as Pat Archer, Fana Mokoena as General Bizimungu, Hakeem Kae-Kazim as George Rutaganda, Tony Kgoroge as Gregoire and an uncredited Jean Reno as Sabena Airlines President, Mr. Tillens. Cheadle gives a magnificent Oscar-worthy performance (he lost to Jamie Foxx in Ray), Okonedo also gives very good support, and the film itself has all the right elements to make it quite a powerful drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Song for ""Million Voices"". It was number 90 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!",

It depicts the events of a genocide in Rwanda in 1994, during which Hutu man Paul Rusesabagina shelters the endangered Tutsi civilians from the angry machete-armed Hutus. The film handles it's subject matter very well, telling precisely why these two ""types"" of people, (they are really only different in name, which was given to them by Belgian imperialists based on vague classifications) are not getting along, without being too simple. The film than follows the Schindler's List formula, with Paul trying to shelter as many of the Tutsis that come his way, and hold off the Hutus for as long as possible. The acting, script, score, cinematography etc. are all of a good standard, though nothing really stood out for me (which in this case is a good thing as it enhances the realism). The film should also be praised for challenging the viewers watching, in a line that Jack Daglish's character (the cameraman) says. The film is difficult to watch at times, and works as it's own film very well. It's only major failing is that it may seem a bit samey for those who have seen Schindler's List, or even Lord of War, or any other film with genocide as the subject matter.",

While Paul's (Don Cheadle) situation continues to get worse as the movie progresses just like Adrien Brody, he does whatever he can to help the Tutsi and Hutu refugees at his hotel. Cheadle is gripping - this from a man who has played a wide range of roles from a porn star with an identity crisis in Boogie Nights to Sammy Davis Jr. in the Rat Pack - and he supplements the troubling story of the country's civil war and genocide with a flawless performance. I immediately wanted to research the Rwanda situation after I saw the movie to learn more than the little I already knew - it truly was a war fought for outrageous reasons, and the ignorance of the rest of the world (something the movie did well to convey) at that time is hard to imagine.

I haven't seen a performance like that in a very long time. He and Sophie Okonedo were both incredible. It was very moving. It's hard to not feel like something is wrong with a world where we can live peacefully in America and people are living that way in Rwanda... still to this day.

Yes, the movie is one of the most upsetting pieces I have ever seen, but this is only an indication of the greatness of the Hotel Rwanda. The actors (especially Cheadle) are so believable in each of their roles, that it does not take long for the audience to take an interest in the main figures, their lives, and the lives of their friends and neighbors.

Paul (Don Cheadle) is an amazing character. He makes you feel ashamed of yourself. Could you face this sort of thing in the same fashion as he did? I kept asking myself that question the whole time. To be reminded of this atrocities is one thing, but to confront them and still keep a straight and gentle face is another thing. Paul is such an amazing character he's beyond human, and Don Cheadle portrayed this man with such dignity and charisma it left me biting my nails every moment.

As with many based-on-a-true-story features, I did some internet reading to see what others said of its historical accuracy or lack thereof, but that rabbit hole only led to more confusing controversy. Ultimately, it's not my place to weight in on such matters, anyways, as surely I don't know enough about the Rwandan genocide, let alone Rusesabagina's part in events, to comment informatively. I bring this up because, ultimately, in any such narrative cinema, we are not only watching a limited perspective of someone's story (in this case, that of Rusesabagina), but we're also seeing it as filtered by the cinematics brought by the filmmakers. A sort of cinematic colonization of history is troublesome enough, but the screen representation only becomes more dubious in the manufacturing of that history for mainstream, Western appeal. Given that the real-life narrative was neglected in the rest of the world, it becomes all the more disheartening that this becomes the primary way many of us come to learn or care about such tragedy.",

They are caught in the midst of a series of political and social twists that escalate and turn into a genocidal civil war, and we can see how they suffer and fear for their lives. The way they quickly capture our sympathy turns their fears into our fears, in a powerful and very emotional way. Suddenly, those deaths also affect us and the initial sense of detachment fades. What more could a movie want? Despite this, the film isn't very graphic, we are spared the most painful scenes, although it has many shocking scenes. The film also criticizes the inability of UN to intervene there and save lives. Don Cheadle led the cast and made the biggest film of his career to date, shining in an inspired and profound performance.

132,16 June 2017,sol-,7, Grand Hotel,"Based on the true story of a Rwandan hotel manager who sheltered over a thousand refugees during the 1994 genocide, 'Hotel Rwanda' offers a glimpse at a sad chapter of modern history seldom told. Often mentioned is the blind eye turned by the outside world to what is happening in Rwanda with a key piece of dialogue coming from lead actor Don Cheadle saying that they need to shame the world into helping out. The film is supported by strong performances from not only Cheadle but also Sophie Okonedo as his strong-willed wife who truly rises above stereotype: she is never once fragile, passive or helpless. Upon initial release, the film attained comparisons to 'Schindler's List' with a similar story of a brave man sheltering others in war, however, such comparisons actually reveal some of 'Hotel Rwanda''s shortfalls. Most notably, Cheadle's Paul is honorable and generous from the get-go compared to Oskar Schindler's who gradually progresses from greedy to selfless. Spielberg's inclusion of seemingly random subplots (like the gun that does not go off) also paint a fuller picture of the Holocaust, whereas 'Hotel Rwanda' offers a far more contained portrait of the genocide. And yet, if not the out-and-out masterpiece that some claim it to be, 'Hotel Rwanda' remains quite an accomplished motion picture with tension frequently felt in the air.",

Hotel Rwanda is a film that is able to produce these sorts of reactions, but also feelings on a level of suspense and horror as certain scenes and situations play out involving people we have come to be quite fond of. The film is more of a re-telling of certain events than it is a study of anything in particular, although the protagonist of the hour does possess characteristics of great honour and courage at a time of need. In truth, Hotel Rwanda does feel a little bit stagey at times while at others, feels made for television.

Don Cheadle portrays the real Paul Rusesabagina, the Hutu manager of the Belgium-owned hotel Mille Collines who, while trying to protect his own family (his wife being a Tutsi) from the irrational killing, ends up offering asylum and protection to about 1,000 Tutsi and Hutu refugees.

136,6 December 2005,liston15,6, A missed opportunity,"Hotel Rwanda is all right, but it is only all right and certainly does not merit the praise that has been heaped on it. It is true that is it has given a new audience to the terrible atrocities of 1994, but this does not get away from the fact that it is only a slightly above average film. If anything, it should have been easier to make a great film because of the power of the story, but instead of letting the events speak for themselves they end up Hollywood-izing it. The most glaring pandering to the Western audience is the fact that everyone speaks English, which reminded me of the awful portrayals of the German soldiers in all the old war films, where they speak English in a German accent. But this is only the tip of the iceberg and there are plenty of changes with how things really happened. Again, what did happen what so ghastly that there was no need to do this, and there seems a lack of understanding that something can be emotionally powerful without intrusive music that cheaply pulls at the heart strings. And why, oh why, did they not use more of the Rwandan countryside. It's certainly one of the most beautiful places I have ever been and the film missed a trick in this respect. The Constant Gardener's cinematography is much better, even though the lush greens of Rwanda would be much more conducive. But despite everything I hate about this film, I still like it. It is exciting in some parts, and with other parts is successful in making you angry about how the West left all these people to be brutally murdered.

Despite a Rwandan genocide in 1994 carried out the Hutu militia as revenge for being oppressed by the Tutsi in previous years Paul's humanity and bravery still prevailed. His qualities and actions could sound like a fictional hero yet it is very real. In the most dire situations the bravest and most humane stand out. Despite different conditions and circumstances Paul Rusesabagina in the film shares similarities with Oscar Schindler in Schindler's list who used his factory to save so many Jewish people.

145,16 March 2005,wheatdog,10, Awareness,"Having heard excellent things about this film I finally had the opportunity last night to see it before it left the cinemas here. I thought it was fantastic, extremely moving and well made. Don Cheadle excels in the lead role. The pacing and tension in the film is fantastic as Cheadle gradually takes on the role of protector for the Tutsi refugees, pleading and bargaining for their safety through his various connections forged as the manager of the luxurious Milles Des Collines hotel. His torn allegiance between his immediate family and the refugees he houses is at times both difficult and fascinating to watch. The ambush by Hutu rebels on the UN convoy with Cheadle's family on board is simply heart-stopping film at it's very best. Also the river road and Joaquin Phoenix's shame at being escorted to safety by the man with the umbrella are two of many unforgettable moments. The film opened my eyes to a wider world and I now feel ashamed of my relative ignorance and, more importantly, indifference to world events. It's true that I alone cannot make a difference but if more people are aware of incidents such as the one depicted to such breathtaking effect in this film then maybe in future people won't be left behind. Whoever, if anyone, reads this post, please either go or urge people to go and see this film. It is relevant in so many ways and it opened my eyes to problems so much bigger than working late and traffic jams.",
146,4 June 2018,krocheav,9, Hotel Rwanda - Makes Us Consider,"British Co-writer, producer/director Terry George (The Promise '17) has certainly carved out a name for being a maker of films to give us cause to think. He's also capable of showing the un-show able without resorting to sensationalised cinema 'stylized' violence - in fact, his great control allows us to be horrified & moved to tears with a remarkable lack of explicitness. So effective is his approach, the viewer feels as though they were watching an unfolding documentary account. His performers give remarkably convincing portrayals, leaving no doubt that cast and crew all shared Mr George's passion for this tragic cause. Excellent production values ensure an involving experience without overdone visual CGI excesses - making all that we do see so convincingly real. Some have drawn comparisons to Schindler's List but, that was stylized Hollywood, where' Rwanda' is all raw soul - giving it a far more compelling believability. ",

A bad filmmaker would make this into a sweet melodrama with all the clichés and trite ideas. A good director has made this heavy story into a real must see foe everyone who wanna know about what genocide is and how awful vile people may behave. Terry George made a great work here, showing just one page of that tragic book - hotelier Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu, saving hundreds of both Tutsi and Hutu from immediate murder and shame. His actions are shown as actions not of a super hero, but a mere man of flesh and blood, but with guts and valor to withstand the threat, deceive the killers gently, buy the time, do all one can do in such gruesome situation, and thus save those people. Don Cheadle is a highlight of this as a main hero, and his dignity, vigor, skills and power shine all throughout the movie. Nick Nolte as an UN officer is another great stronghold here, brave and level-headed man of duty and word. Even the cameos of such stars as Joaquin Phoenix or Cara Seymour are absolute treat. And then, there are all those vile, brutal Hutu warriors with machete and guns, cold-blooded and intolerant. They are shown so deeply true that they awake sheer terror and shiver.

How film makers can create a film either by not carrying out their full research of a subject, or, even worse, by ignoring the stories of the victims themselves is deplorable, incompetent and extremely insulting to audiences and victims of the so-called 'true story' in question. The lack of integrity and shrewdness of the film makers and the profiteering techniques employed indirectly endorse the actions of their heroic war-criminal. It is no 'true story'!

'Hotel Rwanda' deserves credit for bringing this wrongly-ignored tragedy to our attention, albeit long after the killing; but it fails to really answer the question. A smooth, urbane hotel manager suddenly finds that half the country wants to kill the other half, and ends up trying to protect as many of his fellow citizens as follows. But the murderous violence comes out of nowhere, and perhaps cannot be truly understood through the perspective of a westernised member of the middle classes; and the widespread nature of the terror (a million people were killed in all) is not really captured. Although it's quite normal to personalise a story that seems too large to tell completely (think 'Schindler's List' for an obvious example), I found it hard to get a true sense of the wider society of which the hotel is supposed to be a microcosm (just as the one heroic U.N. officer we see appears equally without a context of his own).

The problem, for me, with Hotel Rwanda is the casting of Nick Nolte as a UN peace keeper. Every time that Nolte appears on screen I'm pulled out of the movie. No longer am I in Rwanda but on a Hollywood set and big name actors are trying to act. Its distracting and it almost ruins the movie since it takes several minutes after each of his appearances to calm down enough to once again get lost in the story.

The Rwandan genocide, lasting just a few months, was one of the greatest tragedies among many in the twentieth century. The US, Europe and the UN stood by and watched and this leaves us lessons for current conflicts in Sudan and other parts of Africa. As a movie, Hotel Rwanda is wonderful. Don Cheadle is perfect as Paul, tough and determined but full of doubt and fear. Any of us could be Paul but few would have the guts and strength. Some reviewers have claimed the movie is too Hollywood or does not show the true violence, but the use of sound, facial emotions and scenery forces the viewer to put themselves in the place of a Rwandan, not an American viewer. The movie is almost a documentary of what happened but is also very moving and an appropriate length. All in our theater were choked up with emotion at the end. I spent time in Tanzania in 2003, next door to Rwanda. East Africa is still dealing with the repercussions of the Rwandan genocide and so should the world.

Sophie Okonedo was badly miscast; whoever saw a Tutsi that light-complexioned? Nick Nolte just wasn't believable as a General. Some may criticise me for being too bloodthirsty, but apart from the episode when Cheadle was driving over the bodies in the road, the depiction of the treatment of Tutsi was too long-range and detached.

The only other movie I can possibly think of to compare it to is ""Schindler's List."" This movie reminded me of why I go see movies.

As Cheadle comes to understand that he was duped by the rhetoric Joaquin Phoenix, who plays a reporter assigned to cover Rwanda, suggests that the most likely reaction of the western world after watching the horrible footage on the news would be: ""They will say how horrible, and will go on eating their dinner."" The lack of an international intervention force, in a situation when it was truly needed, is one of the main points of this movie.

It depicts how the central character Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu, manager of a four-star Hotel uses his diplomatic skills and political contacts tries to save hordes of Tutsis while he himself is in grave danger of being hunted down by the Hutus for harboring Tutsis. It depicts wonderfully how gruesome ethnic hatred is induced by the State to maintain its political clout. A wonderful melange of politics at various hierarchies. It depicts how regional politics for control instigates mob mentality and gruesome genocide, how international politics keeps UN from taking any affirmative action, how individual politics played by Paul Rusesabagina helps save lives. It skillfully presents the contrast between how common people torn by ethnic strife and witness to thousands of killings, many of them near and dear, accept their fate while some others in power try to extract every single ounce they can to fulfill their personal greed.

The problem with this movie is a bit on how it's done. I understand the direction the movie was going with light on the gore and rather on the story but I felt it just left a bit too much out, as we know close to a million people where killed, although we really never get that feeling watching the movie. The great movie ""passion of the Christ"" uses extreme gore to drive home a point, and perhaps tell a story like it really is not so that we don't turn off some viewers.

The reality of the scenes hits you so hard as to make you think you could be one of those souls stranded in the hotel if you were born under wrong circumstances. The acting, directing, story telling, everything about this movie looks impeccable. Technically, there could be some minor flaws to a trained eye, but the little cinematographic details are simply obstructed by the sheer power of the story. A movie about a million people who were butchered with machetes can't escape the violent and disturbing scenes but the blood and gore were craftily kept spare to keep the focus on human drama. Even then, you feel the violence much more powerfully than cheap Tarantino movies, in which brains and guts are lavishly splattered all over the place for redneck audience consumption.

I can't believe that this was supposed to be about the real, devastating events that actually happened in Rwanda. I bet most of people who gave this movie rave reviews are just compensating for their previous ignorance and apathy. It's a mediocre, shallow movie parading itself as a powerful film about the great feat of a man standing up for humanity and protecting refugees during a time of ethnic genocide.

Set in 1994 where war runs rabid in third world countries Don Cheadle plays a hotel manager threatened with death when soldiers and tanks patrol the streets in search of refugees. Bodies litter the street until Cheadle opens his hotel for others to seek safety although he is running out of resources to bribe protection. Director Terry George captures the conditions and emotions of the event but he also portrays a Biblical allegory with regards to one man risking all, including his own life for the benefit of others. The performances are in top form although Joaquin Phoenix is too brief to warrant necessary. One wonders what he is doing there in the first place. Great performance by Cheadle who pulls off all the stops while struggling to survive himself. He is backed by Sophie Okonedo as his wife who shows support and concern. Then we are given a scene stealing performance by Nick Nolte who appears as a soldier whose best scenes appear towards the end when all chaos breaks loose. This is a well made film that technically conveys the atmosphere these people were stricken with. Strong themes of self sacrifice rewarded in this tense and suspenseful independent film.

202,1 April 2007,Sylviastel,10, The Timing of the Actual Genocide could not be anymore poignant!,"In 1994, Steven Spielberg and the film, Schindler's List, won countless awards and honors for it's subject on the Holocaust and how one German businessman, Oskar Schindler, caught in the struggle helped save over a thousand lives. Like Paul in Hotel Rwanda, Oskar was a businessman who was seeking opportunity in Cracow. Just like Paul, Oskar saved a thousand lives from the gas chambers and concentration camps. While Rwanda is nowhere near Eastern Europe and is located in Africa, we know very little about Rwanda. In 1994, the Rwandan president was murdered leaving two ethnic groups, the Hutus, and the Tutsis as enemies again. The order was removed. The Hutus were incited by hatred, lies, propaganda, and direction from their leader to kill those ""cockroaches"" known as the Tutsis. By the end of the genocide, almost a million Tutsis were murdered. Paul is a hotel manager for a Belgium company, Sabena, who is put in charge. His wife is a Tutsi and he is a Hutu. The hotel has guests played by Nick Nolte who is a Canadian UN Peacekeeper unable to do anything because of red tape and Joaquin Phoenix is a cameraman for a news organization who risks his life to videotape the slaughter on the streets. For those sheltered at the Hotel, Paul maintains that it will be a safe place whether there is enough food, water, or supplies. Paul must bargain with the general who does not believe that he will be found guilty of war crimes against the Tutsis. The horrors of this genocide is not brutal because we don't see much blood but we see bodies lying on lawns and the brainwashed killers with machetes. Paul played by Don Cheadle definitely earned his Academy Award nomination as did Sophie Okeondo who was nominated. I wished it was nominated for best film of the year. Unfortunately, the western nations took their slow time in stopping the genocide. Rwanda does not have oil but coffee and tea. This story is about 1268 refugees who survived the genocide in 1994.",

Unfortunately, the film itself was hard to watch for me, because the music is just terrible (MIDI keyboard orchestrations and irritating melodic motives), the work of camera and generally visual work is boring and amateurish. If they gave such strong story based on such dramatic political situation to better director and crew, they could have made second ""Schindler's List"" out of it.

Maybe even the very worst. After all, has there been a situation since where 800,000 people were murdered in a three month period? Not only that but they were primarily killed by being hacked to death by machetes; women, children, babies – everyone. The massacres were a result of the Hutu tribe taking vengeance on their Tutsi counterparts. The problem between the tribes had its roots in colonialism, where the Belgians had installed the Tutsis in positions of power due to them looking more 'European'. This ties in with more recent events in the Middle East where Western intervention has caused many more problems than it has resolved. Unfortunately, history has a tendency of repeating itself. But the biggest disgrace of the Rwandan situation was that the world actually did not intervene when the people of the country really needed them to. They did nothing aside from save their own citizens. The United Nations came out of it looking especially bad and completely ineffective, basically withdrawing when ten of their men were killed. The fallout was an unchecked murder spree of unbelievable proportions.",

206,25 March 2005,megawimp,7," A good movie, yet ....","To keep it short: What really turned me down was that the makers of this movie or maybe rather the writer of the script didn't have the courage to focus on the events of the genocide in rwanda as such. Why couldn't they just try and show the mere barbarism of what really happened. Like the catholic church of rwanda got involved in massacres, like last days neighbors became murders over night - and the dimensions of the genocide itself which were unseen of since the shoa. 800'000 to 1 million people slaughtered within 3 months, for the greater part with machetes and other tools - very little of this does shine through the almost romantic story of a brave and pure man. Sometimes I think that such stories rather use events like the rwanda genocide for a historical background only: The main story seems to be this of heroism where in fact a mass killing among neighbours was going on in rwanda. what fits this picture is the way the rebels of the rlf are glorified in the end of the film. in fact, after they had kicked out parts of the hutu murder gangs, they started intense killing based on racist projections too. it is still unknown among historians how many the killed then, but figures may go up very, very high. But as I said - maybe the actual events aren't that important for hero-movies like this. What I liked about the film was the role of the u.n. and the post-colonialist governments as portrayed in ""hotel rwanda"": in fact the international community witnessed over months the mass murder.",

They are human beings! We should have sent some people. Why fight in Iraq? They don't want our help. The Rwandans did. The story tells you about a true story about a man named Paul Rusesabagina Who opened a 5 star hotel to Tutsi refugees. He was brave and was willing to do anything to help people. Now Hotel Rwanda (Don Cheadle) Gave a great performance. Don Cheadle played Paul Rusesabagina. He is a hotel manager of the Mille Collines. He had to do some things to bribe some Rwandan Generals to help him when help is needed. Tatiana's brother came and started to talk about the big war that is coming he said when they say their words The Big war would Start. Paul said don't worry We'll talk tomorrow. Couple of hours later the radio said their words. The elite squad the Interhamwae started killing. the killings got worse. They brought buses for the white people to go home safely while Rwandans are being killed. The friend of paul who's the leader gave paul some more supplies. And told him to take a better road out of goodwill. But it wasn't He was showing Paul how many people he had killed. They days went by more refugees came to the hotel. The white people brought help.But left because they think The Rwandans are dirt. They figured out a way to save the tutsi's by crossing the rebel lines. Therefore the people could go home. Paul and His family went back to a safe place away from Rwanda. This Story is very heart breaking. Paul is One brave person. This movie is the best movie I've seen that shows how the world is.

223,20 February 2006,EUyeshima,10, Human Face on Little Known Genocide...Devastating Viewing,"The thought of almost a million people killed over a 100-day period is beyond imagination, but that is exactly what happened a mere ten years ago in Rwanda when the dominant Hutu tribe slaughtered the minority Tutsi tribe in a civil war that drew little media attention, and much worse, minimal help from the United Nations peacekeeping forces. The killings were the most brutal possible, as the Tutsis were murdered one person at a time. Just like Oskar Schindler, Paul Rusesabagina is the unlikeliest of heroes, as this soft-spoken family man and savvy negotiator is put to the test in the posh Hôtel des Milles Collines, which he manages in the capital city of Kigali. Against absurd odds, he is able to provide refuge for nearly 1,300 Tutsis and consequently saved their lives. Written by Kier Pearson and Terry George, this remarkable story has been directed powerfully by George, who makes the wise decision to focus on the plight of Rusesabagina and his family rather than take a more epic approach to what would have been too overwhelming to view in full force. Their situation is compelling enough given that Paul is a Hutu and his wife is a Tutsi. Consequently, there is less emphasis on the actual killings and the political leaders involved, though enough is shown to leave a lasting impression. The prospect of death always feels imminent as the story whittles away all the parties who could have helped the Tutsis but chose not to.",

I think that it did a really good job of portraying the horrors of the genocide to the viewers. On top of that, it showed that no country came to the aid of the Tutsis. The UN was there, but they did nothing which really shocked me. I thought that in a humanitarian crisis like the Rwandan genocide the UN would be very concerned and have a lot of involvement in helping the people, but they did not seem to be doing anything at all. I hope that in future crises, the UN would have much more of an impact to stop deaths from occurring.

Although this is not a foreign film, it is very educational, because one who has never really heard about what exactly happened during the Rwandan genocide or know anything about it, can learn something new by watching this film. I particularly liked Paul the best in the movie as he was also one of the main characters. He took the risk, by taking in refugees that were going to get killed, and let them stay in his hotel, which I thought was a very audacious thing to do. I really liked the way that he cared for the other Rwandan people, since he was the one to step up to save them. There are many things that I enjoyed about this movie like, the way it was filmed, and the scenes and emotions that the people showed, but it would have been even better if this film showed the effect that the Genocide had on the Rwandan population and the younger children. This film stressed Paul as a heroic character, not only did he protect his family, but he protected others. I thought this was a great movie, and based on this reasoning I would give it a 5/5 .",

237,7 June 2009,valadas,8, The word is genocide,"Yes genocide committed against Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda in 1994: almost one million dead. The authors of the massacre were the Hutu militiamen. A particular savage massacre including of children and women done chiefly with cutlasses. This is what this movie is about and it describes and shows the situation and the various acts of violence in a very realistic and convincing way. But this is also the story of a particularly courageous man, a Hutu hotel manager married to a Tutsi who, risking his own life and safety, sheltered in his hotel in Kigali more than 1,000 people of the Tutsi ethnic group thus saving their lives. A small parenthesis now to say that some ethnologists say that the differences between Hutus and Tutsis are much more social than ethnic. It was fomented by German and Belgian colonists during their respective rules of the countries of Rwanda and Burundi following the old maxim that to rule you must divide; the German colonists considered Hutus those natives who possessed more than ten cows or (and) had an European-like straight nose. Both groups had lived in peace till the arrival of Germans first and Belgians later and only after that and after the decolonization period they began to be at each other's throats with Hutus killing Tutsis in Rwanda and Tutsis killing Hutus in the neighbouring Burundi. But going back to the movie this is in fact a true story (in the sense that the narrated facts happened indeed) and told in a succession of revealing episodes, images and dialogues of great strength that don't put aside the clear responsibility of western powers who deliberately withdrew their troops and abandoned the victims to their doom betraying their mission of maintaining order and protecting innocent civilians. Also an excellent performance of the cast mainly of the principal protagonists such as the Hutu hotel manager, his Tutsi wife and the UN commander in charge of protecting the hotel with a ridiculous half a dozen troops or so but who, despite that, accomplishes his mission in a brave and gallant way (performed by Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo and the veteran Nick Nolte).",

254,13 December 2016,magilroy,8, Amazing movie depicting Rwandan Genocide,"Hotel Rwanda, directed by Terry George, is an American film that depicts the genocide in Rwanda. The Rwandan Genocide arose from conflicts between two ethnic groups, the Hutus and Tutsis. When the Belgians originally colonized Rwanda, they choose the officials to lead the country according to skin color and nose size that agreed with people in the Tutsis ethnic group. This caused a rift between the two groups thus leading to the genocide. Paul is a Hutu hotel manager for an upper class vacation hotel. His wife and most of his family are Tutsis which eventually leads to their endangerment. After the genocide starts, Paul is dumbfounded by the atrocities that are committed by the Hutus. With the safety of people in mind, Paul decides to help protect Tutsis people by letting them stay at the hotel after all the white vacationers fled from the violence. Paul continuously pays off the generals for protection and calls upon all his resources to help his family and all the refugees as well as stop the genocide. Paul eventually is able to help many of the refugees escape along with his family and two stranded cousins whose parents had been killed. This film is an amazing film that helped me learn and understand the Rwandan Genocide. I would recommend this movie to everyone in order to help educate people so that history does not repeat itself.",

The desperate, unsought heroism of Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) is the foreground tale in ""Hotel Rwanda,"" and it is brilliantly and suspensefully told. But equally important is the background: abandonment of the Rwandan Tutsis by the Europeans, who sent troops to save only their own citizens, the United Nations whose soldiers (led in the film by Nick Nolte's anguished colonel) were forbidden to fire their weapons, and the United States whose euphemisms and evasions are recounted in the supposed radio interview of a State Department spokesperson. And, of course, the other African nations did in Rwanda what they are now doing in the Sudan -- nothing. This is possibly the most painful movie I've seen since ""The Pawnbroker"" of many decades past. It's hard to believe that this is the same Don Cheadle who played a homicidal maniac in ""Devil in a Blue Dress."" While most actors, even highly skilled actors, play versions of themselves in other films, Cheadle is an entirely different person here: dignified, highly intelligent, crafty, cool, emotional. It's a brilliant performance. One hopes that other major roles will be found for him. He deserves to be a household name. In addition to Nick Nolte, superb as the UN commander,credit must also be given to Sophie Okenedo as Rusesabagina's wife and to Fana Mokoena as Augustin Bizimungo, the corrupt head of the Rwandan Army who countenances the slaughter by the Hutu mob.

264,29 October 2014,RossRivero99,10, A towering masterpiece,"Terry George's Hotel Rwanda is not only a movie about the Rwandan genocide in 1994 that lasted 100 days but it is a movie where hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (played by Don Cheadle) (even though he is a Hutu) is defending Tutsi refugees including his wife Tatiana Rusesabagina (played by Sophie Okonedo) (while being protected by the United Nations) from the Hutu militia known as the Interhamwe. While watching this movie another movie entered my mind over an dover again and that was Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993) because both movies were powerful stories told in an extraordinary way. The writing, casting and story was very intelligent , as well as the supporting cast which includes Nick Nolte as the commanding U.N. officer, Joaquin Phoenix as a press cameraman, and many more well done performances. Out of all the best Actor nominees at the 77th Academy Awards i think that any single one could have won instead of Jamie Foxx for his performance in Ray (2004) but really Cheadle deserved it the most because his performance was moving, and inspirational because he proved that a man must make tough decisions in his life, and that you have to do the right thing even if you don't feel so sure about it.",

It was explained as a really horrific thing which had mass killings of people, that's why going into this movie I was interested in what I would be shown. The way the movie started gave me the American movie type feel, having a successful man with a family running a hotel and of course the language of the film being in English. As soon as the killing started I couldn't quite see why it did, but it turns out the reason was that one ethnic group disliked the other, that's all. In my opinion, the most horrific scene in this movie was when Paul was driving down the ""clear"" road and it was really bumpy and foggy out. Then they discovered that the road was full of dead bodies. I like doing the way the movie ended with Paul's family making it out mostly safe, but I would've liked to see where the young went after they got onto the bus.",

The parts played by all were heart felt and even though i cannot begin to understand what it was like. I give this film a 10 out of 10 i know this world is full of hatred and barbarians but................. never have i been moved by a scene such as the misty road scene. The struggles and trials and tribulations of Don Cheadle playing Paul a man ""playing both sides"" and his ""cockroach"" family and staff make me wonder exactly what the character and indeed the actor went through to achieve the tension the success and the horror to what the people of Rwanda must and did go through. The scenes were beautifully shot and even the ""chopping"" were to add a sense of reality to the situation for want of a better word. It can be compared to ""Schindlers List"" and even ""Saving Private Ryan"" for the ""Reality"" of the world today that it brings. The atrocities of the police chief and the warehouse people taking ""Paul"" as a dedicated Hutu but not quite understanding him as a man with morals and beliefs was easy to see but then again hard to understand.

In the face of these unspeakable actions, inspired by his love for his family, an ordinary man summons extraordinary courage to save the lives of over a thousand helpless refugees, by granting them shelter in the hotel he manages.

However, how much sympathy is contained in such help? It's not just respect for life.
When the disaster came, he finally chose to leave. Perhaps for him, it is moral to assist the weak, but to stand by for granted.
There are also white people who once lived in Rwandan restaurants. When they left, there was hardly any expression on their faces. Except for the lady whose dog is sick.
They have never personally experienced the pain of the skin of the Rwandan people, so no matter what, no matter what, the sense of superiority as a white man always exists.

This movie shows an example of genocide, political corruption, and brutal violence. While protecting his wife and kids, Paul must do whatever it takes to save his innocent people. A powerful and emotional premise makes a really excellent movie. With an all-star cast including Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo in Oscar-nominated performances, and Joaquin Pheonix, Nick Nolte, and Jean Reno, a brilliant directing job by Terry George, and a powerful script by George and Keir Pearson, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a perfect example of one of my favorite movies. There is nothing about this movie that I did not like. At times, there were moments that were so emotional, that I felt really bad inside. Every moment in the film, I was begging for more, and I was on the edge of my seat during the more suspenseful scenes. Don Cheadle delivers the best performance of his career as Paul Rusesabagina, and he totally deserved his past Oscar nomination. This movie has everything that a movie can offer. Some suspenseful tear-jerking scenes, and some beautiful touching moments are all that's really needed to make the movie good. I was left amazed, from beginning to end, on how great this movie was. I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. With a brilliant cast, a beautiful message, and some suspenseful sequences, this is truly a cinematic ""must-watch"".

I can't believe there was nobody to protect the people in the hotel. Paul was my favorite character because he never gave up on his guests. He loved his family and just wanted to make them safe, but he was also willing to stay behind and help the people who stayed in the hotel. Paul was genuinely my favorite character I've watched in any movie this year. He was very brave and never thought about just saving himself. Moreover, it was crazy to think that nobody in American politics wanted to help. I think they definitely knew what was going on over there. America intervenes in so many conflicts it just doesn't make any sense as to why they wouldn't help. I was curious as to why people in America didn't help, so I decided to do some research. Not only did America abandon the Rwandan people but also other major powers, like France. When the killing in Rwanda intensified the major powers pulled out. The French set up a ""humanitarian zone"" which is where I guess the people from the hotel ended up in the end of the movie. I guess that was helpful but nobody wanted to go beyond and reach out to pull innocent people into the safe zone. Also, I found an article that said Bill Clinton knew about the mass killing of people in Rwanda but buried the evidence so America wouldn't intervene. The officers who were on the ground in Rwanda used the word Genocide when they described the situation; however, because Bill Clinton had already decided not to intervene the press never got coverage of the killings as a genocide.",

Horrible sight to see but very well filmed. I understand that the UN has the job of keeping peace but they should have done more earlier in the film to help the Tutsi. The UN is a lot more helpful towards the end of the film rather than the beginning of it. It is very mind blowing how the Hutus just wanted to wipe out all of the Tutsi just because they were different than them. Tsotsi are smaller, lighter colored and also referred to as cockroaches. I believe that the world should be ashamed of what happened in Rwanda. None of the superpowers helped at all. It makes no sense that America did not intervene because we stick our heads in literally everything.

The casting was mediocre, especially Nick Nolte, but also including most of the smaller parts, although Don Cheadle and his wife were portrayed competently. It was an obvious attempt to take a single series of events--the actions of this hotel manager--and parlay them into a typical movie format, when the Rwandan genocide deserved, indeed deserves, much more significant treatment. The one redeeming feature of the film was its portrayal of the cowardly and bigoted manner in which the West dealt with the tragedy, but even that was done without impact.

That quote is from George Rutaganda and he tells us the start of what he said about the civil war between the Tutsi and the Hutu militias. That is the setting in Hotel Rwanda, which is based on a true story about the civil war in Rwanda in 1994 and how one man managed to saved those who were caught in the cross hairs of a raging war.

Paul's first concerns are to protect his family and to maintain a high level of service in the hotel. As the killing frenzy grows around him, so do his compassion and pragmatism, and he gradually opens his heart and the hotel's doors, converting luxurious quarters into a refugee camp. Nothing is overdone, and there is no preaching. But as the chaos spreads, turning neighbor against neighbor, the movie develops moral and artistic power. Private scenes are beautiful and convincing. Crowd scenes are authentic and riveting. Early on, as approaching guns explode and children huddle in fear, a small boy flinches in the crowd. You flinch with him. That's it. You're there.

Don Cheadle's performance is very good, and there are several moments of real tension, but I couldn't stop feeling that almost everything in the movie was designed to bludgeon the viewer and provoke guilt. As for me, I don't think France should be the policeman for the world, and neither should the United States.

Dave is probably eating his words now. I have rarely seen a performance that was as realistic as Cheadle's as Paul Rusesabagina. I can't say that I know Mr. Rusesabagina, but I sure felt like I knew him after this film. Cheadle makes the character believable because he is able to convey the character's personality not only by his delivery, but the by subtle nuances not often seen in film. I couldn't imagine any other actor in this role, and Mr. Cheadle really carries this film forward. Though I give kudos for director Terry George for not only bringing this hard story to life, but doing a terrific job with the directing, as well as the other cast members, Cheadle is the one who carries this film. On a side note, many would like to compare this to ""Schindler's List"". While the subject is similar in that one man saves thousands, you realize that Mr. Rusesabagina probably had a harder job because while Mr. Schindler already had some clout with the Nazis, Mr. Rusesabagina had no real sympathizers and had to use any resources he could while his own life and family were in danger.

324,19 February 2010,johnmschofield,10, A shining example of one person's fight to try and do the right thing,I first watched this film only recently and after it was finished my overall feeling was of depression. Before I go any further I should say that it was a very disturbing and moving experience and I am glad that I spent the time to watch it properly. The film is very well made and the storyline is strong and ultimately as in most of this type of film the end result is whatever you make of it. This description sounds extremely vague but in my opinion the positive way of looking at it is that at least someone stood up to be counted and actually tried to save some of the people. If you look at it in a negative way only a small percentage of people were saved and perhaps it could be seen to be a futile attempt at trying to do what you can when virtually nobody is willing to help for numerous reasons. The way I sum it up is that one person saving one other person is an achievement and if everybody who was able tried this who knows how many more could have been saved. Anyway this film portrays people in the very worst of circumstances and this lofty ideal has its merits but when you are in a position of death being just a heartbeat away it doesn't really figure too highly in the minds of everybody under this sort of pressure. This film has been compared to Schindlers list and when you have watched it you will probably see why. This film represents an example of what happens when a group of people try to impose their will on another group of people. In my opinion unfortunately this situation will keep happening somewhere else because the United Nations and other organisations cannot act soon enough and when they do their frame of reference is so limited any peace keeping forces will not be able to interfere. At some point somebody in authority hopefully decides to do something helpful and if as in this case it is successful the world and its dog can watch in awe as someone cares enough to risk his or her life for others. Sadly it simply doesn't happen often enough and that is ultimately why this film is depressing to me. However as a shining example of a really brave person trying to do the right thing I would recommend this film to anyone.,

That no one interfered is not so much sad as much as it is infuriating. To think this is still happening today is a frightening sign of the times.

On the part of the United States, Rwanda was low on the list of priorities; fresh from the Bosnia conflict, and interventions in Haiti and Somalia, the US did not want to risk involvement there. A small unit of UN peacekeepers were deployed, but suffered under heavy restrictions. They were given little money and outdated equipment. When Rwandan president Habyarimana's plane was shot down in April, the dam broke and Hutu flooded the streets out for blood. The minority Tutsi were considered the enemy and were targeted by roadblocks and constant radio broadcasts calling for their extermination. Moderate Hutu also came under the blade of the machete (the preferred weapon of the masses). What started as essentially a social conflict, or what most thought a prelude to civil war, erupted into chaotic slaughter amongst a poor and uneducated populous. Bodies lay strewn in the streets, in the houses and rivers. Even before the violence reached its apex, and the term genocide became unavoidable, the world powers seemed to have forgotten Rwanda and left the country to burn.",

A true life story of Paul Rusasebagina a man employed as the manager of the most luxurious hotel in Kigali the capital city of Rwanda. Rawanda came into news when the most inhuman barbarous crimes against humanity were committed during the period of June-July 1994. I still remember the bodies falling from water fall i watched on CNN and BBC, i remember the brutal slaying of 2 Tutsi women by Hutu men by machete's caught on a distant camera. In these times a man which is portrayed in this film voluntarily gave refuge to hundreds of Tutsi people in his hotel, although he himself is Hutu and his wife is a Tutsi. By doing this he himself endangered his own life by being labeled as a traitor to his own tribe but in the long terms he saved so much lives. This movie also shows the callous and extremely non serious attitude of the world community the U.N , NATO Eurpopean union And The U.S , they left the whole country at its own in such a horrendous , horrific and merciful situation when so many helpless folks needed them. If u see the movie collateral , u ll see tom cruise quoting about Rwanda "" ten of thousands of people were massacred before sun down , no one has killed that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki"". It almost really happened. While talking about Paul rusasebagina it also reminds me of another person , a Hutu politician i saw on BBC at the 10th anniversary of Rwandan genocide, he allowed quite a few Tutsi children to leave the country under a safe passage while the militia men were standing in their way with their fear some weapons but he risked every thing to save the lives of Tutsi children. I believe the world needs people like these , which are free from hatred prejudice narrow mindedness and aggression in their hearts and minds. If the film is concerned i like the work don cheadle, the direction and production , induction of nick nolte and Joaquin Phoenix and more over the song ""million voices"" in the end which some times brings tears into my eyes.

337,29 May 2014,orourkec-292-269155,7, Shameful and compelling.,"Summary: HOTEL RWANDA stars Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina, a real lifetime hotel manager who became a courageous hero in Kigali when he witnessed the horrifying massacre of the Tutsis by the Hutu extremists in Rwanda, while the rest of the world looked on and did nothing about it. The massacre was part of one of the few of the worst atrocities in humankind history and it really occurred in April 1994, now twenty years ago. This is a story that really happened and it isn't fictional. 4 or maybe 5 parts of the true reality were changed in the film, but overall the movie mostly shows what really happened, I think. This is the kind of dramatic motion picture which completely catches your attention and drives you through the minds and emotions experienced by the leading characters. This is a story that I believe everyone should pay careful attention because Hotel Rwanda is truly sobering and heartfelt, and I'm really not kidding about it. In my opinion, everyone should like this movie and pay close attention to the way characters behave, because that's mainly what captured my mind and made me like the film. My comments are that the actors who had the main lead in the story all played well and were believable inside the skin of their characters they were interpreting. Don Cheadle and Sophie Kurlenko had an excellent performance and I won't ever forget it. Their performance was well done, because the magnitude of their performance was so high and that really shows the power of the human struggle and how much they care about the problems taking place around them. Plus, the film has feel-good warmth, is constantly filled with one problem after another, has a sparklingly original, well written screenplay and that's all great. This isn't a movie about action, but about the human heart and don't already think in advance that the movie will be boring with not enough action. JUST go watch it and see it for yourself. Enjoy!",

340,21 September 2005,Pigalina,10, Must see.,"My friend said she would only recommend this movie to someone who ""wanted to bawl their eyes out for two hours."" She's not far wrong. The film, a true story, is set in 1994 when the Hutu and Tutsi's began a bloody civil war. The main character is Paul who works in a fancy hotel. His wife is a Tutsi and her race is the target of the Hutu who intend to kill every single one. With the UN pulling out and the world deserting them, Paul ends up hiding about 1000 Tutsi's inside the hotel. This is not a pleasant film to watch, I sat there full of dread waiting for the next horrible thing to happen. There is one scene that is even more horrifying when you remember that it really happened; Paul and Gregoire are driving through fog along a very bumpy road. The bumps turn out not to be the result of poor maintenance but hundreds of bodies littering the road. The acting is fantastic - I am regularly surprised by the talent of child actors, and this movie was another where the children we very believable. I don't really know what else to say about it, no wonder it was a hit at the film festivals. This was an excellent film all round, I have not a single complaint with it.",
341,11 July 2020,pensive_englishman,10, Highly gruesome but deeply resonating,"Before watching this movie I actually invited a former colleague from Sri Lanka - a war torn country for over 4 decades as recent as 2009, as I thought we could discuss the movie afterwards. She said she couldn't watch such movie because it was too cruel. And I totally understand where she comes from after this viewing.
We all know no war movies can be more real than wars themselves. It is heart wrenching and tear bringing enough to watch such art pieces, let alone living in actual war zones. This movie is extremely raw, visual and emotional in that it depicts the wounds, scars and traumas in a very uncensored way. Raping, chopping, shooting and bombing permeate the whole scenes which make bleeding, killing, slaying and slaughtering ""natural"" and ""organic"" consequences of those acts. One cannot help wondering why politics is so brutal and relentless. Yet in real life it is not that simple.
The world is never a safe place. And life is never fair go. As revealed in Titanic (1997) where Rose says ""it is so unfair"" to her mother when she knows she is used as a marriage pawn, her mother consents with the same exclamation. If British nobles complain about life, how much less can people in such desperate and destitute situation resent? Western countries have generous refugee programs. Yet again these are just a drop in the ocean unless the root causes for war and conflict can be addressed. That is, a political solution be found. Easier said than done, isn't it? Many need help, but only a few will be offered. We simply cannot help everyone. Does this answer sound all too familiar? This can't be more truly reflected in the last section of this movie where the hotel guests are driven to the safe passage in trucks while many, many other roadside refugees do not have the same privilege or luck other than looking on. I always say concepts are relative. Whether you are good or bad, smart or stupid, lucky or unlucky, kind or evil largely depends on whom you set as your benchmark. There are always people in more dire situations than you.
There are many gruesome scenes in this movie , so much so that I think it's what makes this show a true success from a technical point of view - dead bodies lying everywhere, blood shedding becoming commonplace etc. What I want to point out, however, is that there are equally many truly moving moments. A UK Red Cross aid worker risks her life multiple times trying to carry as many orphans as possible to safe havens. Paul the hotel manager as well as the leading character leaves his family behind and stays to help the stranded hotel guests. It is this kind of professionalism and altruism that tap into my heart. The captain goes down with the ship. Or you jump, I jump, as Jack promises to Rose in Titanic (1997).
Technicality also makes this show a success. Don Cheadle isn't just an avenger. He can also act in serious dramas like this. And the true story definitely satiates audience's taste. The fact that the playwright and director make this a happy ending after many rounds of tragedies also lightens people's hearts. Artistic excellence prevails after all.
And ladies and gentlemen just before you go can I ask that we spend one more minute replaying the very last script between the UK aid worker and the hotel manager, as I think it really lifts our spirits?
Aid worker: ""They say there is no room (in the hotel to shelter more refugees).""
Hotel manager: ""There is always room.""
Shall I paraphrase it as there is always hope so you should never give up your fight?",
342,2 March 2007,Weredegu,10, 'Acts of genocide' and acts of bravery,"Just throwing in my 10 points to add up to the total. I haven't seen 'Sometimes in April' yet, so maybe I will indeed scratch my head thinking that one's even better on the Rwandan tragedy, as some say, but right now I'm under the impression of 'Hotel Rwanda'. And I am already pretty sure that those who say this film is a 'light' version of whatever exactly happened are wrong. This film doesn't try to win an Oscar by using brutal pictures a lot to inscribe itself in the viewer's brain. (Though it will still make you feel the violence from time to time.) It's real drama. The background, the genocide, the war and all that, they are important factors, but the point is the drama of hotelier Paul Rusesabagina's family. To steal a US diplomat's words from the movie, you can see some 'acts of genocide', but you won't see 'genocide', at least not for most of the time. And you'll see acts of bravery, but not of the reckless type, not the kind of Hollywood heroism that is an euphemism for stupidity.",

345,27 February 2005,univarn,9, Beautiful Acting but Unemotional Plot,"After watching this movie the only thing really there to do is to applause the performances given by the actors. Don Cheadle gives the defining performance of his career and support from Djimon Hounsuo, Nick Nolte, Sophie Okenedo, and Joaquin Pheonix set this film's acting on a new level. The plot though is just not as emotional as it should have been. Every point were a gut wrenching powerful scene should have occurred this movie takes the quicker thrill route which does make the movie seem just empty at points. Luckily every scene were this is evident there are amazing actors around to back it up and keep the film going on. That is what really makes this movie worth the price of admission or rental is just to see these sensational performances. Though Nick Nolte really doesn't do anything for the film (as usual), his acting style does add a good feeling towards the films character analysis. The best part is watching Don Cheadle's character age and alter during the entire film. I highly recommend you jump out of your seat and head to your local theater as soon as possible. The acting in this film is just mesmerizing and the script is well designed for your average every day movie goer.",

Like one character in the movie said, people in other countries will see this on TV and say it is so horrible, but then they will go out and eat dinner.

When the president of Rwanda's plane is shot down, Hutu extremists go on a rampage and kill around a million Tutsi's. ""Hotel Rwanda"" shows the carnage that occurred.

Some of the scenes in this movie are so powerful, sad, and tearjerking. The scene where all the orphanage children show up at Paul's hotel and are informed they can't leave the country and the scene where Paul's family and some of the other refugees are almost murdered by the Hutu militia were extremely painful to watch. The movie is powerful even from the beginning with the jarring scene of a box of machetes spilling out and the Hutu militia leader bribing Paul with more half priced beer. Nick Nolte also gives a powerful performance. You can tell he really feels bad about not being able to do anything about what's going on around him. The best performance in this movie however, is Don Cheadle who plays a perfect strong straight man character as Paul who must fill several roles and a balancing act to protect everyone he can and be strong for his family.

Even if it wasn't based on a true story, the movie would still be strong, but to know that Paul Rusesabagina is real and his struggle to save his protegees was real, that all that madness really happened, that the mind-blowing killing rate of more then 10 000 per day was achieved is staggering!

Does Hitler pop into your mind? Well, less then ten years ago (in your lifetime) this event happened. The movie Hotel Rwanda is an excellent portrayal of the absolute devastation that took place. Millions of Rwanda natives were killed in this mass genocide. Don Cheadle gives an astonishing portrayal of Paul Rusesagagina a savior for over a thousand caught up in the madness occurring right outside the gates of the Hotel Mille Collines. ""When the world closed its eyes, he opened his arms,"" a tagline that fits oh so well into the heartfelt movie that puts you right into the conflict.

The story all starts when Paul is working at the Hotel and everyone that is there is somewhat very powerful and has a great influence on what goes on in the world. I was surprised seeing it was only a 4 star hotel. An anonymous voice is always heard on the radio that seems to be very angry and filled with revenge. Now, before you watch this movie, you should get a back story on the Rwandan Rebellion between the Hutus and the Tutsis. I'll help explain a little bit, but mainly, the Belgians came in and decided who was to be a Tutsi based on their looks and they were given their position instead of earning it. Due to this, the Hutus eventually had enough of it and the man on the radio said something about falling trees and then instantly the rebellion began. Every Hutu was instantly killing the Tutsis, all based on the separation that occurred only based on a different countries opinion. To me, this is ridiculous, but it is what it is. Another main point is the fact that no other country would get involved, or saw it as a huge problem that they needed to stop. Paul was left at the hotel and eventually it turns into a refugee camp for the Tutsis, now you will have to see the rest. It is a must see!",

It was heartbreaking to see how much the UN wanted to help, but they could not do anything. Paul was an amazing character, who did everything he could to help as many people as he could. He would bribe people, risking his life in the process, and the fact that he held over 1000 refugees in his hotel was amazing. It pained me to see the army treat Paul and his people like dirt, not even attempting to help with the thousands upon thousands of Hutu murders. The armies came, but they arrived to tell the people that they could not help. Most of the Tutsis did nothing to deserve this hate, but they still received the full force of the genocide. On the other hand, some Hutus also did nothing to be involved in the genocide, but they were still blamed for the murders of the Tutsis. It was very good to see that the Hutu General was sent to a war crimes prison after the genocide, because what he did was horrible.

Oh yeah, the rest of the movie - this movie should be required viewing by anyone involved in US diplomatic work in Africa (particularly Darfur / the Sudan) right now.... I can't believe how much I kept seeing the story of Darfur in this movie. Intentional? I don't think so. The DVD did include Cheadle imploring viewers to take action with respect to Darfur, but I think that's because the tragedies occurring there are so similar to what happened in Rwanda and the Western (""Developed"") world's response to both is deplorable. Anyway, good acting, good direction, incredible story (truth is stranger...). I have to say the presentation of the slaughter - the fact the movie did NOT contain blood-and-guts violence they could've probably gotten away with given the nature of the story. The use of tension and the threat of violence that surrounds them always makes the movie meaningful and poignant. All in all, this movie should be required viewing for anyone with a soul.",
374,18 May 2005,Leafsman_69,8," Finially the massacre in Rwanda has been brought to the world's attention, only 11 years too late.","Hotel Rwanda is one of those few cinematic masterpieces that you can recant over and over in your mind, to your families, friends and educators. The movie depicts the desperate situation of a nation torn by civil war and genocide between two major tribes in 1994. However the main focus of the movie deals with a hotel manager who desperately tries to save his family and refugees from the slaughter occurring beyond the hotel property. Normally I am aggravated when a director goes out of his way to give his film a pg-13 so preteens can see it, thus increasing profit. however this movie's rating is highly justified. Everyone deserves to see and care about what had happened in Rwanda, because the world leaders and media at the time of the atrocity certainly did not. With the recent production of numerous WWII movies, the holocaust has been brought to light while the Rwandan genocide had been swept under the the rug, until now. Done Cheadle did a superb job in his role that made me feel like i was right there with him. He is very under-rated and i feel he can out-act even the best such as Denzel Washington. Nolte plays a Canadian UN field leader who is obviously modeled after the Canadian war hero Romeo Dellaire whom attempts to bring the crisis to the international authorities' attention and in return tragically gets his squad of UN peace keepers reduced. This only adds to the desperation of the situation. The movie touches on the personal lives, politics, religion and culture of Rwanda during this short but dark chapter in human history. Much of those who were able to change the outcome of the situation at the time deserve to be shamed by this movie. So many times has society claimed that genocide will never happen again, but i think what society really means is that it will never happen to ""white"" people again. Such a statement can draw this review allot of criticism, but I feel it taps into the darkest part of the human soul where self denial and racism are clearly present. Hotel Rwanda deserves all the accolades it receives and will be shown in homes and classrooms for years to come.

375,12 August 2005,noilie,7, Excellent Film,"I really wish people would stop gushing about how GREAT this film is, how it made you CRY, MOAN, WEAP, GENUFLECT, etc. YES, I agree that the film is brilliant. It GETS one's attention. IT is a story powerfully told. Unfortunately, it also inspires a general sense (to my mind, and after reading some of the posts here) of armchair philanthropy. Stasis. Inactivity. It is great that there is a film that takes Africa and individualized Africans figures, seriously as its primary Subject, tells the story from an African point of view. This is the first mainstream film (to my mind, that has done this). Africa, as a concept, is most often seen as a massive, dirty, backwards ""Heart of Darkness"", unexplored unless by prying, objectifying news cameras (starving children with snot running out of their noses etc.) The fault doesn't lie with the film (it is quite firm about its contempt for the ""West's"" strategic lack of agency). The problem lies with people like YOU, quite happy to sing the film praises, but not much else. There is a post further down that (flippantly) refers to this film as ""This year's Schindler's List"". What a cheek! Yes, this may be one of those ""never forget what happened film's"", but while the Holocaust recedes ever further into history, atrocities of similar proportions still happen on this continent (I am a South-African). The speed and force with which the ""Rwanda"" happened forced the West (retrospectively) to sit up and listen.

I can actually say that I walked away with a different outlook on foreign politics. It was obvious that the actors in this film cared deeply about the meaning of the film and what it really stood for. After watching a documentary on the true events that took place, I truly believe that the movie was as close to what really happened as they could possibly get. This was one of those films that you can't stop thinking about for days. The kind that really get to you, making you glad that you watched it, but sad at the same time. It is too bad that it was only nominated for an Oscar.",
377,13 October 2016,magonzalez-15762,9, Hotel Rwanda,"Hotel Rwanda was about the Rwandan Genocide that occurred recently. Almost a million people were killed in this conflict, many of them being innocent people who were blamed for crimes they did not commit. The Hutu extremists wished to exterminate the population of Tutsi's in their country, as well as any sympathizers to their cause. As a result, thousands were killed and the governments of the world didn't help to stop all of the killing until much later. This story instead focuses around a hotel manager who wants to get his people to safety and has to struggle against the Hutu extremists who wish to wipe out everyone in the hotel. After convincing others and offering them bribes and blackmail, he manages to extract everyone from the hotel. It was both a very sad and uplifting movie to watch. It was powerful to see the way that he struggled through in order to keep his family safe, as well as everyone at the hotel.",
378,29 June 2005,dalbuc,9, An incredibly dignified movie,"This was a really powerful film. The word that leaps to mind is dignified. A film about the genocide in Rwanda could have taken a lot of roads to hit you in the gut. What impressed me is that you don't get a lot of graphic shots - actually no graphic shots. There is less blood in this film than most episodes of CSI. The film assumes you are capable of understand the horror of the event without showing it to you. Don Cheadle has worked in crap like Mission to Mars, Ocean's 11, and Swordfish so the way he pulls out his role Paul Rusesabagina might shock. He really brings out the character who isn't some crusading hero but a normal man who brings the same talents to saving Rwandans that he used to serve guests at his hotel. He plays the role with such grace and ease that the character is wholly credible. The film's biggest emotion for me was less one of sadness than anger. Listening to an actual US State Department broadcast talk about ""Acts of Genocide"" get interrupted by a reporter asking, ""How many acts of genocide does it take before something is genocide."" was maddening. You realize how little effort- manpower and money- it would have taken to avert the killing of almost a million Rwandans but the world sat by and did nothing but make noises at the UN. Pitiful.",

383,14 October 2016,logatherum,5, Good film,"Hotel Rwanda was a well- made film, with some famous actors. It was interesting to see Hollywood actors in a film that seemed foreign, although it wasn't. I did not know very much about the Rwandan Genocide, or the history of other Genocides. Overall, I liked this film, but it was definitely not my favorite because I did not understand it as much as I did the other films; I found myself lost during some parts. My favorite character was Paul because he was so determined. Paul was such a big part in this movie, since he showed that he was not only a good person and hero to his family, but those living in the hotel.His issues made my stressors and issues in my life feel like nothing. Not only was dealing with the genocide, but he was living in the middle of it, AND had to manage an entire hotel! Although it was not his fault by any means, It must've killed him to see all of the families and their children sleeping in the hallways of his hotel every time he was trying to get by them. He must've felt some responsibility and guilt for them having to sleep on a cold floor, especially since he had a wife and children of his own he probably thought of when he saw these people. I also liked his wife, Tatiana a lot as well, because she was so devoted to Paul, and she seemed to keep him in line. I liked that she was a loving wife and mother, but also was not afraid to die for her kids or Paul, since she was so tough. Although we saw struggles of both Paul and Tatiana through their eyes, I would've liked to see more of the kids' struggles and how THEY viewed what was going on. I kind of wish that there was more interaction between the kids at the hotel and Paul and Tatiana's kids, because they were a big part in the movie too since they were so vulnerable. The difference in this movie compared to most of the others, was that there was not violence in the sense that the community was so troubled such as guns and gangs, but because of war and the genocide. So what is the crime really like in Kigali, Rwanda? The crime that is most prominent today is theft and vandalism, at a rate of about 36%, which is considered low.Next, at a rate of 26%, is drugs and people dealing drugs. Violent crimes are less common than petty theft. Interestingly, violent crimes are less likely to happen to a foreigner than a local, as well! A study done in 2015 shows that there has been an increase in robbery in homes, but it mostly happens when people are not in them. Overall, Kigali is a pretty safe place, compared to the other countries in the films we have watched.",
384,2 March 2005,-Peter-,8, Great!,"I saw this one yesterday, after a long day of work at the local theatre. I expected a lot of this one, and what I saw was even better. From the beginning until the end I was emotionally involved in the movie, and it never bored me a moment. --SPOILERS-- In the middle of the movie, when people arrive at the hotel, children being carried in helping hands, buses arriving, this moment -when you hear the African children chant- is one of the most gripping scenes ever captured on film, I almost cried how emotional this scene was, and it repeats itself when all the white people are being evacuated and the blacks look at the buses, completely helpless, being abandoned by the rest of the world. What a great piece of cinema! This will stick in my mind forever. The only thing that makes this not a top 20 IMDb is that I was waiting for such a moment to finish the movie, which stood out. The movie ended a bit to early for me. I missed something at the end, a feeling that leaves you in awe when the movie ends, I didn't felt the emotional impact the movie gave me in the middle of it. Rusesabagina will always be remembered as a great man, who saved the lives of hundreds, but still, the movie hasn't pushed hard enough on that emotion of being the 'hero' he really was during his life at the end. Maybe it's just me, but that's how I left the movie. Nonetheless the best drama I have seen since Mystic River. It could have been one of the greatest movies ever if George had worked out a more emotional impact in the end, but like I said, maybe that's just me. 9.5/10 great movie! Watch it!",
385,10 June 2019,u-12128,10, amazing Paul,"I think Paul is a hero even though he is just a citizen but he saved over thousand of refugees and protect his family, the orphan , even his neighbor.At the last part of the movie, when he argue to the General and he use a confidence power to say it that let the General went back and save the refugees.I think we can not do these action when we were in such dangerous situation. It makes me feel depressed because a lot of people died and they was innocent, I think I will be despair if I meet those event in my country. I think the UN need to distribute more soldier to stop the massacre and be a peacekeeper so that can let the interhawme be prevented so the massacre will stoped. If I am a citizen in Rwanda , I will find my friend who are abroad and let them help me and if I can get rescued I will take as more refugees as I can. I think it is a good movie but it is a good documentary because it can let us know the true dark history of this massacre.So when I visited to Rwanda I will focus more on the history of this civil war. I will recommend the marvel series movies because most of them are about superhero",

Paul is a manager at an upscale, Sabena-owned hotel who risks everything to save the lives of more than one thousand Tutsis. This is the group that was being butchered by the Hutu militia.

It is the true-life story of Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), a Hutu hotel manager who sheltered over a thousand Tutsi refugees from the other warring Hutus.

Although I concede that it may have benefited from its original R rating, the latter seemed intended. Hotel Rwanda does show the genocide as a whole but its also a personal story.",

The president was the only one who was able to put the nation United despite all conflicts and differences between ethnic groups. Facing the death of the president some racists groups start to pop up and Over sunddently gaining more and more power.
The story tells us how Paul Rusesabagina (performed amazingly by don cheadle) manage to protect and save hundreds of refugees and his family.
Sophie Okonedo dispite of not having as much time in the screen she creates a big impact almost working like a mirror for what Paul Rusesabagina is feeling inside but cant transmit to the outside maybe because is afraid of showing wickedness in front of the people who trust him to keep them safe or most importante because he knew the risc and responsibility and didn't want to distract and keep on the plan that was working to save everyone.
One last thing that I want to mention once again was the don cheadle performance. What a lesson to all actors. He's able to express so well every kind of emotions, like happiness, worry, desperate when facing some realities that he didn't understand, like the lack of empathy from the first world citizens when confronted with the reality of hopeless people who are being kill day after day.

I was frightened by how Hollywood may distort the story of the Rwandan genocide for commercial reasons. Well, I have to admit that I think they did a wonderful job. Don Cheadle really rises to the task, despite being American. It feels right to have concentrated on one person's remarkable story and allowing the horrifying conflict ( and the world's guilt ) to remain as a backdrop. I find this an important film in the way Shindlers List was important in telling a man's story and reminding us of the flawed humanity which caused it to happen in the first place.

I cried again when my grandfather, my mother and grandmother died. And I cried a million times, seeing Hotel Rwanda. This movie shows us what happens if we let hate control our minds. It is about Hutu's and Tutsi's in Rwanda. But it is also about all the hatred in all places, at all times. And about the fear of the innocents that is a result of it. And it is about a world not willing to stop violence as long as it does not affect our oil-supplies; our trade-routes; people of our believes or color; our own interests. The movie does not really show all horrific things people do to one another, but it shows us enough to have a good picture of it in our minds. Fortunately it is also about the bravery in many of us, the kindness in our hearts that very understandable only survives if we take care of ourselves first, but leaves room for others. So much we can ask from each other. Help yourself, but never forget the others. For the others are you as well. It is in Rwanda where a piece of me and you has died.

Our media barely covers the wars, famines, droughts until millions of people are dead and then it seems like it is too late for the U.S. politicians to do anything. Great, great movie. Don Cheadle is a master actor. I wish I would see him in more films. Another thought I had about this movie is how it reminded me of the holocaust. America sat by and allowed 6 million Jews, Catholics and gypsies to die before intervening and it had nothing to do with the annihilation of the these people that got us finally into WWII. My own country embarrasses me. When will we ever use our great power to help others rather than accumulate as many material things that we can before we die?

It is not only a black page in Rwanda's history but because of modern internationalization and media a black page in the history of mankind. One becomes aware of the worthlessness of life and the price that is paid for the colonization of Africa and its consequences. This film is a statement in itself, and remembers us of so many mass murders in recent ages. The superb acting by Don Cheadle who acts like a hero, but a very good cast overall support the story and message. Equally good is the storyline and involvement with the characters. This combined with the fact that violence is always on the background, but only seldom on the foreground (although there are some violent scenes, mainly the results are shown) makes this movie not a vampire movie... This movie should be in history lessons everywhere... with the full background story.

In addition a little more historical background may have been more appropriate for foreigners like myself who didn't quite understand the crisis at the beginning of the film. -such an footnote would have be more helpful.

408,16 April 2016,snord-94860,4, A forceful message,"Sadly, this movie just didn't do it for me for a number of reasons. I knew coming in that with this type of movie, depicting an horrific historical event, that it is a difficult line to walk. Many movies make the message too heavy-handed, utilizing ""message-based- dialogue"" that doesn't feel believable. Then there are others like Schindler's List that masterfully demonstrate the horrors, yet remain cinematic masterpieces. I heard so many good things about it from friends and saw the cast and thought that it was going to be good, but left feeling a empty. First, I did not feel the chemistry between Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo. From the opening, I didn't feel much of a connection between them and although they kissed and ""do"" what a married couple should, there was something missing. Secondly, I thought that the editing was a little odd in a couple places. For example, when Cheadle and Okonedo are on the roof at night, there is a part that it unnecessarily cuts to the guns shots over the city. It wasn't anything that helped the movie, but left me a little distracted. Thirdly, I have to complain about the theme of the movie being preached through a megaphone. All good art has to allow the viewer to reach for their own conclusions, invite them in and allow them to interpret. When any art form forces a certain feeling or message upon the viewer, it is insulting to them because it comes off as the director or writer don't trust the audience to reach the same conclusion. This was done mainly through the dialogue. So many of the lines seemed forced in order to get the message that the genocide was bad. This was also done with all the pictures of the dead. The last thing I want to do is offend anyone by downplaying how horrendous this event was, but I believe it should have been represented in a more tactful way. Many times, less is more. Let the audience come to that conclusion without it being shoved down our their throat. However, given all these things that I didn't like, I did enjoy some parts. The individual acting of most characters was good (Phoenix, Mokoena, and Kgoroge to name a few). I also thought that the cinematography was good. The lighting used to help the essence of each scene come forth was well done. Finally, I enjoyed the sound design. It did a much better job of subtly stating the mood of the scene and brought me in as a viewer to interpret with it. Positives: Good sound design, some good acting, and good cinematography. Negatives: Forceful theme/ message, lack of chemistry between leads, and distracting edits in some parts. Conclusion: If you want to watch a movie that tells you how to feel about genocide and war instead of inviting you to develop your own thoughts, you'd probably like the movie.",

I haven't seen an actor like Denzel even give a greater performance than what Cheadle has done in this film. Cheadle rocks in every scene. Sophia is amazing as Cheadle's wife, so natural. While Pheonix is OK, doesn't get a meaty role here. Nick Nolte is good too, in a well written role. The screenplay is outstanding. The Editing is sharp. This movie is FLAWLESS. Mark my words. This film will shock you. It's very emotional at times, so if you going to go see it, make sure to take tissues. Everyone in the theatre was crying in many scenes. This film is POWERFUL. It will knock you off your feet. It gives you outstanding performances, amazing screenplay, off the hook direction, crisp editing, astonishing cinetography.",

421,11 January 2005,billyindica,10, A Very Emotional and Strong Movie... An Instant Classic!,"I haven't gotten the chance of seeing ""The Aviator"" yet, but excluding that, ""Hotel Rwanda"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" are IMO, the two very best movies of 2004! Hotel Rwanda immediately took me in the very first 20 minutes of the film.. The passion Cheadle used in playing this role is remarkable, this being an understatement.. His strong performance only added on to the already amazing story of this tragic incident.. Playing as a Modern Day Harriet Tubman, his character took on a huge responsibility, caught between the rivalry of two tribes, He let some 1,000 people (give or take) take refuge in a Rwanda Hotel that he managed, and him being married to a member of the opposing tribe didn't make his situation any better.. me myself, being a young man, I am not ashamed to say that I cried a few times during my viewing, not only because of the circumstances of the situation, or not even because of the UN's part in this, But simply because Cheadles Character was Such a passionate man, such a strong man who had to make split decisions to protect a whole people, including his family.. The fact that this man really compromised, and cared about his people to an extent to which he did not see the difference in Tribes, they were all people, all African people who'm he felt obligated to protect.. The movie had very powerful scenes and messages, and is one of the most important movies since ""Rosewood"", Where Cheadle also played an important role.. Totally recommended, Rated R for emotional impact though, so beware.. this is one of my personal favorites, it seems as if 2004 has been a very great year for film.. Highly Recommended! 9/10, one point off because nothing in this world is perfect..",
422,13 January 2005,waivedwench,10," a very hard film to watch, but no more than we deserve","I saw this film in the theatre this afternoon and I can honestly say that not since ""Schindler's List"" have I been more moved, saddened, shocked and angered by a movie than I was by ""Hotel Rwanda"". It is a well-crafted, hard-hitting script that is both a testimony to one man's courage and a searing indictment of the West's unforgivable indifference to the tragedy. It is not easy viewing, but I can't help but think that really, we deserve this. We all have blood on our hands. The acting was excellent, particularly Don Cheadle and Sophie Okoneda (Oscar nominations, anyone?). But I was a little irked by Nick Nolte rather ""uneven"" Canadian accent. If anyone to learn more about the man who inspired Nolte's character, read ""Shaking Hands with the Devil"" by General Romeo Dallaire. It's every bit as disturbing and compelling as ""Hotel Rwanda""",
423,6 February 2005,Shoegazer29,3," very, very disappointing","do not see ""Hotel Rwanda"" ever. and by ever i mean never ever. not in theaters and certainly not when it comes out on DVD. do not rent it. do not watch it at a friend's house. if it is ever screened on television...change the channel. now you might be wandering what is so bad about this movie, and to be perfectly honest it wasn't the worst movie i've ever seen (cough-""Armageddon""-cough), but it was without a doubt one of the most disappointing releases in years. what works me up so much about this particular film's suckage is the buzz surrounding it; three Oscar nominations - THREE!! don cheadle was fine, but that was about it. i don't give kudos to performances that beg for them, and this would be such a case. the story that the film explores, the rwandan genocide of 1994, is in itself a captivating subject. however the way in which this conflict is presented in this film plumbs all the depths of my bathroom sink. but the cardinal sin of this clunker is doubtlessly the writing. i might only feel this way because i personally have an interest in screen writing, and because it is my belief that you can only make a good film if you start with a good screenplay, but in any case, the dialogue and pacing in ""Hotel Rwanda"" just plain blows. i can't count how many times i rolled my eyes during one of cheadle's characters monologues. i could go on forever but i...i just need to stop. i suppose i'll finish by telling you, the reader, that i really hate this movie because it did have promise. there were moments where i almost felt a twinge of compassion for the characters and events on screen, and that is why this is the most frustrating release in a long time. +_+_+_+_3/10_+_+_+_+",
424,13 October 2016,tadegeare,8, Rwandan Genocide,"Hotel Rwanda was the first movie that we have watched in English and it didn't really stand out that much. The other movies were just as easy to follow which was surprising to me. This movie provided a wonderful, yet frightening, reality of the genocide in Rwanda. It went into depth the struggles that all of the Tutsi citizens when through as well as the harshness of the treatment they received from the Hutus that were out to kill them. Paul was a very friendly and loving character who always was the center of most things and was nice enough to overflow his hotel with Tutsi guests who had no where to go. He seemed to know most of the people and have connections that were able to save him and others lives when in need. I was kept on the edge of my seat most of the time because really anything could happen at anytime. Movies that aren't predictable are much more exciting to watch and movies that are surrounded by chaos and disorder are unpredictable.",

427,9 February 2005,fooltank77,6," I am happy this film was made, but... (Spoiler Warning)","Terry George deserves much praise for being able to make this movie about a difficult time in the recent history of the world. Prior to seeing this movie I knew very little about the conflict that took place in Rwanda, and thus I am glad to have seen this movie to learn about the horrors that took place there in 1994. However, as a film itself, I believe Hotel Rwanda is very flawed. Everything in the film is milked hard for melodrama, which may be understandable given the subject matter. Nevertheless, I found the handling of this instance in time to be largely heavy-handed. Also, the characterization of many people in this movie felt very black-and-white, such as how the Tutsi Rebels were given somewhat of a hero treatment towards the end, despite the fact it was they who assassinated the President (though maybe it was not the rebels, the movie doesn't make this clear). Additionally, it states at the film's conclusion that the Hutu Army eventually fled to Congo as a happy-ending coda. But what went on in Congo after that? More chaos. The film fails to mention that many of the problems in Rwanda continue to exist in the African continent. Hopefully this will change, though whether it will in my lifetime appears debatable.",

If that kind of thing happen in my life, I might just kill myself first, I can' accept that kind of thing. I truly think Paul is a big hero, he did something that us can't do, sometimes, he will be afraid too, but he still make himself to clam down, because if he don't do this, then they will all die, he try his best to save all the people in the hotel, instead of to only save him self. That was a great decision, all of people understand Paul can easily save him self and his family, but he still save all of them, even he have a chance to go away, he choose to stay here and help everyone here who can't go away. Even he knows he might lose his family and his life.
He 's just a normal person too, but just this thing make him become a hero, what he choose made him to become a hero. I like this movie very much, it shows the most true thing happened before, it make us to remember the history, but not to remember the hatred.",

Because this kind of movie, history, reality & direction are fabulous. No doubt that it deserves Oscar for everything it had. Now I can understand that how much one's life can be hard and to what extent. This blend of reality & direction in this movie is simply heart warming and breath taking.

The situation in itself was already so strong that we didn't need tons of blood splattered all over. They told a very violent history focusing on the human drama, the doubts, hopes, envy and so on. The most dramatic scenes were always happening from a certain distance. That made the film even stronger. It's a nice example of how it is possible to make movies about violent themes with sense and sensibility.

Something this barbaric and senseless could actually take place and did. While America was busy watching the OJ crisis, this was taking place and getting little if no attention. Sadly things of this nature have happened or are happening all over the world every day and yet goes unnoticed from other countries because it doesn't pertain to them.

445,16 April 2005,tperkis,3, complete and utter crap,"When I first heard about this movie I was very excited. Critics were comparing it to Schindler's List, which excited me further. But when I got to theater I realised that Hotel Rwanda was rated PG-13. I instantly knew it was going to suck. Generally, when you make a movie about a mass genocide in which nearly a million people died, your movie is going to be rated R at the very least due to massive amounts of blood and violence. Hotel Rwanda had nothing of the sort. The only time people actually got killed in the movie was when the family which the movie follows are huddled around a TV watching the news which portrays people being hacked by machetes from about 100 yards away. The rest of the movie featured people coming very close to death, but never actually getting killed. If you knew nothing about the mass genocide in Rwanda, and saw this movie, you would assume it consisted of a bunch of nancy boys running around not killing people. There is no blood in this movie at all. Comparing it to Schindler's List is like comparing Evil Dead to Legally Blonde - blasphemy. If you liked this movie then you are a mindless robot programmed by Hollywood to shell out eight bucks every time another blockbuster bore-a-thon comes along.",

This was one of the most touching and convincing movies I ever watched. I was glad I had it on DVD. Sometimes I could not continue and had to pause the DVD, e.g. when Paul leaves the van and sees all those bodies on the road. As a white man living in Europe owning everything that I want, this movie made me feel ashamed. Why did not we really notice what was happening in Africa then?

Not one person who has seen both Ray and Hotel Rwanda has said that Foxx was better than Cheadle. He was robbed of the best actor Oscar in a big way.

This movie has too much political point of viewing. Its interesting on how people become such a shadow in a time that this Africans people needed more. I have to congratulate Mr. Paul Rusesabagina, who believe in a better world, for having tremendous heart. No one nows what lies inside of each person, it deepest thoughts.Anyway, the movie is really a story to be told so no more of this madness can reach any kind of person, independent of their beliefs. When i was watching this movie i remember Schindler List... so i started thinking... Schindler was German and even though he saved Jews, Mr. Rusesabagina was Hutu and he saved too people that were in need. so, my conclusion is it doesn't matter your color, it matters if you have a heart and in what are your beliefs. Movies like that need to be shown cause otherwise people wont be heard. We need to learn with their mistakes. But talking like this i just remember that we must remember that u really did the apartheid was the white man( Belgians)-when they entered in Africa they colonized some countries and divide tribes, and put some of the tribes that weren't friendly with one another as neighbors, and that is how this mess started. Apartheid happen to in South Africa, and we have a model of peace, Mr. Mandela. We need to hear our own voice, we need to hear everybody voice. Because life is worth, and priceless.

Don Cheadle acting was up to par and the realism was good with the AK-47 and the RPG that were used in the time. Something that got me was if they got back on the bus or it left without them. Also I was not aware that it was the FRench who supplied the Huto army. This was a surprising fact. Also what I liked was the sense of comedy that sprung up at tense moments. What I felt to be the most powerful was the scene with the bodies on the road. It shows what Pele do when it is supported by others.

You hear about genocide all the time, the UN colonel says it and I think the news team says it, too. But words alone won't do, not in a movie. All you see is a few hundred bodies scattered on the street. There are no close ups, almost no scenes where you actually see how the Hutu shoot someone and there is only little blood (genocide and no blood? Hallo?!). And as for the role of the UN I can say this: Colonel Oliver behaves like a small child whose lollipop was taken away. You get the impression all they do is standing around, waiting for some other team of soldiers who protect the citizens. This is so ridiculous. I was too shocked at the image of the UN to be shocked when I should have been. Furthermore the movie shows a short time span, so you don't get the context in which this war takes place. Only once it is mentioned that the Tutsi (who are now slaughtered) suppressed the Hutu. But of course the Hutu are the bad guys and we are not to like them. At this point the movie pushes the audience's sympathy in one direction.

458,2 November 2008,rachel_d_walker,9, A must see!,"Hotel Rwanda is the amazing and heartwarming true story of Paul Rusesabagina, played wonderfully by Don Cheadle. Paul owns a hotel in violent Rwanda during the civil war. The Hutu and Tutsi people are at odds and Paul is a Hutu and his wife, Tatiana, is a Tutsi. In the midst of the war Paul sees the atrocities being committed to his fellow Rwandans and makes his hotel a safe haven for refugees. The film is incredibly moving. Although it shows the horrors of life in Rwanda during the war, with people being dragged from their homes, murdered, and living scared for their lives, there is also a humanity and uplifting aspect. The compassion that Paul and his wife have for the refugees and the risks they are willing to take to keep those within the hotel is heartwarming. One of my favorite things about the film is that it doesn't shy away from portraying the Rwandan conflict and the genocide that is occurring and brings the country's issues to light. The film has raised awareness of the genocide and telling this true story brings some hope to the situation. Cheadle is amazing in the film and carries it.

Your Pepsi bottle will remain untouched for the rest of the movie. Not too short, not too long, the perfect closing for any day of the year, this movie will rank high in my personal top list for a long time. Some good actors are in non-leading roles but they are still giving their best and doing a great job. Regardless of its truthfulness, the movie goes to your heart and stays there. Let me just quote a few verses from the song that's ending the movie: If the USA can be the United States of America Why can't we be the United States of Africa If the England can be the United Kingdom Why can't we be the United Kingdom of Africa",
465,16 May 2011,timumich,10, Very Important Film,"Wow. I am speechless. Watching this story unfold through Don Cheadle's eyes is relentlessly gripping. At the beginning we see him telling others that everything will be OK because ""the world press is watching"" but is it? There is a disconnect between these poor countries with corrupt governments and wealthier countries, which is highlighted by this movie. The reasons behind this disconnect could be largely political, or simply due to general apathy or ignorance, but no matter what it is disturbing. This is a very important film that duly raises awareness to the atrocities that exist in today's society, and we must not turn our heads.",

It's hard to imagine how a Hutu hotel manager who was originally selfish and well-disciplined would rather sacrifice himself and protect these Tutsi refugees. He can be called a hero.The war between races is terrible and humanity is extinct. Maybe in the Interhamwn, killing people who don't blink, the classmates, neighbors, and colleagues who are joking with you for the last second, took the knife and gun in the next second, rushed into your house, hacked you and your family. It is incredible.
Peace is commendable. I hope that we can all cherish peace and maintain peace. At the same time, I hope that those who slash their swords to their class will put down the butcher's knife and take a good look at the surrounding bodies. Those who are familiar with you! Don't be blinded by hatred, let go of hatred between races!",

I remember the news--500,000, 800,000, maybe up to a million people were butchered. We did Nothing. White people from away got out, and that was all.

People don't seem to understand that it is BASED on a true story. Just because it is about something terrible that happened, people instantly change their criteria for what makes a good film. At the end of the day, this film is still poorly directed; has poorly delivered, cringe-worthy dialogue; some kind of product placement in every other scene; two dimensional characters; glosses over the genocide by only referring to it and never actually showing anyone getting killed; has gaping plot holes; and for some reason tries to put the blame of what happened on the Europe and America.

I watched in the special features that they didn't want people to be scared to come see it because of the gore. On the contrary I think It would have made more people come see it.,
471,31 August 2005,pigeoncake,8, Powerful original pre-release poster,"I have yet to see this film but I would like to comment on the first pre-release poster I saw on a huge billboard. The image was very minimal and stark. A black background with a horizontal side-view of a shiny, scuffed machete blade. The only text being a very amateur looking 'Hotel Rwanda' in gold coloured Times New Roman font. Why was this image so powerful? Firstly I could see no clues as to what this poster was advertising, apart from the title obviously but the image itself didn't look like other movie posters, there was something nonconformist and more real about it. No airbrushing, no stylised fonts - just a stark, quite unsettling image of a weapon designed to cause a lot of damage. As much as the poster shook and to some extent impressed me because of it's originality, I thought it was tad insensitive but perhaps that is good for westerners who know so little about what happened. A few days later I could no longer see the original poster, it had been replaced with a more acceptable Hollywood style image, still depicting the machete blade only with airbrushed sad faces of the central characters inside it. That kind of killed my curiosity a bit but nevertheless I'll be renting this out when I have some money. Oh and I rated it 8 to be polite as I haven't seen it yet!",

In reviews for this movie I have run across a few negative comments by the critics, and the main one has been that ""the movie is too much of a 'hero' piece,"" and to those critics I respond: yes! It is a hero piece! Paul Rusesabagina was a hero. But it wasn't just that. Nolte's character is a hero. And, even though these characters are seen as heroes in the film, they have their weaknesses. Cheadle's characterization of Rusesabagina is incredible; extremely strong, yet extremely human and emotional. This film is an amazing biography of a real man who lived through a real tragedy.",

I had read about the events in Rwanda in 1994 and assumed this movie would be a ""downer"" and difficult to watch. I was completely wrong -- the movie is riveting from beginning to end, and I thought the scenes with the disembodied radio voice ordering massacres were among the most powerful and disturbing I've ever seen on film. A brilliant job capturing, on a personal level, the horror of the events (although, from what I understand, the horror was actually far worse than what we see in the film).

The relationship between the hotel manager and his wife was utterly wonderful and real. Sophie Okonedo is the best actress of today. She is not pretty for starters; she is even taller than her husband. Have you ever seen an American movie with a star like this? She does not get hysterical and yet she remains warmhearted and passionate. And she is devoted to her family and to her neighbors. And Don Cheadal is the best actor. He has dignity.

Unfortunately, save for a few scenes and the panic in people's faces, we don't really feel the full impact of the slaughter. Over the course of several months, approximately 800,000 men, women, and children were butchered simply because of their fictionalized ethnicity provided by the Belgian colonialists. That's a lot of zeros. And yet, from the movie, it feels as if a few of those zeros are missing.",

Seeing this story unfold about one man who wants nothing more than for he and his family to survive is something that everyone needs to see. Don Cheadle is that man and his work here left me speechless. I say the same thing regarding Sophie Okonedo. They had such great chemistry together and when apart their acting chops were just as strong. Terry George has done a great thing by bringing this story to the public.

On the other hand, I thoroughly respected HBO's handling of this most sensitive and disgraceful Rwandan situation which was effectively portrayed by a virtually unknown cast of extremely talented actors.

Would recommend it to all who are tired of the run of the mill movies out there. The tale is of courage,of cunning, of survival and is true. How Paul tries to ""save up"" on favors for a rainy day, how conditions make him form a man out to survive into a hero of his own scale to save others. How he deals with having to juggle his position between the factions that he belongs to and that of his wife. In bits and pieces, it is all there. And the end is amazing. A worthy film that portrays what sick things can happen and how easily we all turn a blind eye. Well this film reminds and tells us we were there and we were blind as it happened. Kudos to the cast and crew. Effort was complete, not just a quick documentary or total Hollywood whitewash of the topic.

No one ever talks about these things because no doubt it's a very hard subject, but the thing that sucks was the fact the Rwandan genocide was never shown on the news or the fact that the United Nations did very little in Rwanda.This movie about a hotel manager who saved over a thousand Hutu and Tutsi refugees is very much like Oskar Schlinder who saved over a thousand Jews during the holocaust. If you want to see more about genocide I strongly recommend that you watch Schlinder's List (this movie has many similarities to Hotel Rwanda) and Ararat (this one is about the Armenian genocide that happened during World War I).

What this movie does is more real than that: it takes you to that moment in time which changes a country. It makes you understand that a country is made up of individual people, that each one has a story and a choice. It shows how quickly things can get out of hand, how easy it is to divide a people, how tragic the consequences. This movie doesn't hold back and sugar-coat the brutality and drama. The massacre was of unspeakable proportion. But Hotel Rwanda also tells of awesome courage, real deeds by real people. Just as shocking it is to see the bloody brutality of the war, it is even more amazing to see the steely resolve of those people who decided to do the right thing come what may, even at the risk of their own lives. The movie's graphic images haunted me, but the overall feeling it left behind was that of hope and courage.

Don is on screen in just about every minute of this fabulous film, and each scene is acted with strength and emotion, and the fact that he was on in almost every scene while doing such an incredible job was alone enough to give Don a best actor bid at the Oscars. Jamie Foxx was great and deserved this award. While many, including me, might find this film disturbing, it really is uplifting at the same time, to see how one man can truly make a difference.

However, I don't think people bring the critical acclaim the motion picture - not the documentary - needs: Many actors and actresses did a rather poor job, especially Nick Nolte was really disappointing in my opinion. I appreciate the directors job for delivering a movie with tension and the information every viewer needed, but after the parts couldn't make me believe they really happened because of the in some scenes crappy performances by the UN-Guy and Paul's wife which just let me realize that even if these things happened, they don't seem as real as they could if the actors would do a better job.

It deals with Rwanda's civil war, and shows us how a single person can change permanently so many other's destinies, other than his and his family's. It also gives a very important message in an absolutely non-rhetorical way: war is the worst the human being can do and/or have. No winners, only losers. The movie also criticizes the rich West (Europe & North America) which cares about countries which can make worse our standard of living, but does not care at all about so many other countries who suffer a very bad social, economical, political situation.

It makes me feel depressed because a lot of people died and they was innocent, I think I will be despair if I meet those event in my country.
I think the UN need to distribute more soldier to stop the massacre and be a peacekeeper so that can let the interhawme be prevented so the massacre will stoped.
If I am a citizen in Rwanda , I will find my friend who are abroad and let them help me and if I can get rescued I will take as more refugees as I can.
I think it is a good movie but it is a good documentary because it can let us know the true dark history of this massacre.So when I visited to Rwanda I will focus more on the history of this civil war.

Based on the true story of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who sheltered more than 1,200 Hutus and Tutsis during the 1994 Rwandan massacre, Terry George's ""Hotel Rwanda"" -- beautifully constructed and directed, with a career-defining performance by Don Cheadle and exceptional supporting work by Sophie Okonedo -- is one of those pictures. ""The Passion of the Christ"" was the movie most alleged Christians were hyped up about this year, probably because it allowed them to feel self-congratulatory about their willingness to wallow in their savior's suffering. But ""Hotel Rwanda"" is the picture that really captures the essence of Judeo-Christian values: It takes the measure of our compassion for our fellow human beings, and demands that we hold ourselves accountable for the things we might have done and didn't.",
511,4 August 2006,ifeverido81,10, 2004's Best Film,"Hotel Rwanda is a film that left me speechless at it's end. This true story tells of one human being's selfless guile that saved nearly 1300 lives in war ravaged Rwanda in 1994. Paul Rusesabagina and his family faced certain, cruel death as he called in every favor owed him by friends and enemies alike, and he sheltered these children, women and men in the luxury hotel he managed. Living in a society where tribal distinctions can be deadly, Paul had to think on his feet, as he faced down a marauding Hutu military committed to the annihilation of all Tutsi's and Tutsi sympathizers. Paul was Hutu but his wife Tatiana, and therefore their children, were Tutsi. Hope, in the face of overwhelming terror and complete abandonment by governments and institutions, including the UN, is the prevailing theme I was left with. Though I still have to question our humanity as I watch the bloodshed continue in the Sudan. ""Hotel Rwanda"" delivers the body blows that will take you out of yourself, at least for a while; then you are reminded that the human spirit is powerful.",
512,7 August 2006,free_admission1983,10, Terrific,"There's a staggering, emotional power to this movie, which won the popular People's Choice Award at this year's Toronto Film Festival over more than 200 other films. Set on the eve of the Hutus' genocidal massacre of the Tutsis in 1994, the film's about the bravery of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who harbors hundreds of Tutsis from slaughter. As Rusesabagina, Don Cheadle delivers a real throat-choker, and his performance is even more poignant by dint of being based on reality. Sophie Okonedo is also effective in the film. The fact that she was able to swim(and not sink)next to Cheadle is an accomplishment in itself, but the performance is truly riveting. Don and Sophie definitely deserved the Oscars they were nominated for, unfortunately they left unrewarded for their work.",

Director Terry George wisely lets the story and brilliant acting by Oscar-nominated Don Cheadle as Hutu hotel owner Paul Rusesabagina and Sophie Okonedo as his Tutsi wife do the talking. See Hotel Rwanda, not just because you'll be viewing one of the best films of 2004. Go see it as an act of penance, for our collective sin of omission, as a reminder not to be indifferent. ",
514,27 December 2006,ali_jawad21,10, Remarkable! Finally a film highlighting a serious issue in the most realistic and jaw-dropping circumstances.,"How can this film NOT win an Oscar?! It touched upon the most sensitive issues with such skill and drama that the viewers would find themselves in the most incredible positions. It was tense, had huge amounts of suspense and most certainly it was the film of the year because of the most powerful acting that i have seen from the 21st century. This film tells of the trouble in the African country of Rwanda when the country was split into Hutu and Tutsi tribes, this situation accelerates into civil war between these tribes but the outside world want no part in helping this troubled nation. However the fabulous director concentrates the story on one man's skill and bravery in saving the people in his hotel who at the end are all people running to the hotel for safety. Do not expect to be embraced by spectacular views such as Africa's inspiring nature but expect death and hundreds of bodies piled up on each other. This film is not gruesome in any real way but, these pictures have to be shown as this was the reality of the Rwanda conflict. For the first time in film history you will be able to connect with the sufferers and victims entirely from your own seat. ",

It feels like you have been transported back to that time and are experiencing the entire situation. This is not about war or violence but rather about the human nature. How the willpower of one man changed the lives of many. The story is backed by some great acting and direction. This movie moves us and makes us feel. This movie cannot be expressed by words. You have to see the movie to experience it's magic.",
517,5 March 2010,Richasantos,8, Reality too real!,"There is only one thing I can say after seeing this movie. They made reality too real. The horror lived by the Tutsi's was put on the silver screen with shocking realism and in gruesome detail. Hotel Rwanda represents bravery (about those who helped solve this conflict, focused on saving as many people as possible without concern for their own wellbeing), it cant also represent cruelty (about those who killed thousands of people because they had a different nose or lighter skin). Basically, It's a movie that symbolizes humanities strengths and weaknesses. It also shows us that African countries cannot overcome their own problems without asking Europe or USA (for example) for help. Through the entire movie bribes and favors are a constant subject. For me, reality doesn't make me cry, doesn't make me laugh, but It does make me think: How/Why is mankind capable of committing such atrocities? How/Why are there men capable of not respecting the meaning of life? How/Why are there men capable of respecting the lives of others more then their own?",

519,21 July 2011,guitarist_94,10," One of our most shameful times as a human race, sad but true.","After watching Hotel Rwanda, I realized why this film is considered as the ""African Schindler's List"". Based on a true story, Hotel Rwanda managed to capture the brightest and darkest sides of the human race - from the heroic deeds of Mr. Rusesabagina to the horrendous Rwandan genocide. Until I watched this movie, I had only heard about the Rwandan genocide, I had no idea about how terrifying and brutal it really was. The film didn't only manage to portray the cold-blooded actions of the Interahamwe, but also the West's shameful ability to neglect and ignore the genocide of almost a million innocent Tutsi and Hutu refugees - one of the reasons to why this was one of the most shameful and horrific times of our race. The plot was mostly historically accurate as far as I know (except some dramatization in some scenes such as when Paul doesn't get on the bus with his family and stays behind at the hotel instead). Surprisingly though, the movie was not dramatized in the violent aspect, as according to Mr. Rusesabagina, the violence in the movie was far less severe than it was during the actual genocide. Nonetheless, I must add that Cheadle's performance really had me, his portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina was astonishing and real (as far as I know), while Nick Nolte's acting also kept me satisfied. Finally, a word to the man himself, Paul Rusesabagina. You, sir, have inspired me a whole lot. I cannot think of anyone else who has affected me in way that you have and I hope that your legacy will live on forever.",
520,31 May 2014,marcelious_117,8, A must watch for history lovers.,"Hotel Rwanda is one of those movies that I had quite a tough time rating. Picking between a 7, 8 or 9 was very difficult. As you see I picked an 8. Here's why. The movie was well filmed, well written, extremely well acted and well edited, but I found that the pacing was a little bit slow at some points. Other then that, this was quite an excellent movie. As always, Don Cheadle excelled in his part as the hotel manager. One of the things that was so very appealing about this film was the fact that the story that they told actually happened. And it's hard to believe that many of us never even heard about it. There is also something to be said about the real-life human being that Don Cheadle portrayed. The hotel manager was such an interesting and caring man, that is always a plus in my books when I'm looking for a lead role. So in conclusion, I should just say that this film is really good and you should at least watch the trailer to find out what you think. ",

When I the theater i thought to myself about why the world never did anything to interject. At the time this went on my father was in the Army and i was unable to vote. Why did you people not act? My father asks why as well he was willing to go there and give his life in order to stop the mass genocide. I blame the fact that this movie is so empowering on the failings of those that had a voice during that time. If you are one of thoughs people then i hold you responsible for not acting. As the movie displayed individual people did act and made a difference, why didn't the individual people here make a difference. Namely Bill Clinton, he could have done something about this but he was afraid of political opinion with out the backing of the UN. He was a afraid of another Somalia event, which by record wasn't really that bad, it's the basic fact that America doesn't except that when one joins the Military the are forced to sign a paper stating that there is the possibility that they will get in harm's way and that the will possibly die because of it. Hopefully this movie will open peoples eyes and the will see the failings of ourselves. but unfortunately when i saw the movie there where 6 other people in the theater excluding myself and my friends.

Aren't that the main requirements for a good movie? Whilst watching this film, the most important (but hurtful) emotional experience for me was the reliving of the pain I felt when I saw a documentary about Rwanda a few years ago. This movie really hurts - in a good way. But that will probably limit the business prospects. The good acting pulls you into it because you feel with the main characters. And it makes you think a lot about how this world has to change and how we could find instruments to minimize cruelties like the murders of hundreds of thousands of children, women and men that happened down there in Rwanda and in other places.",

Because some people born in a wealthy family can eat ice cream and stay at a lovely house watch TV-Show. But at that time you need to keep run away from disaster and killing. Run for your own life and as the same time you will need to save your family. Otherwise they will die in front of your eyes.
In my personal opinion i think this is a fantastic movie becasue it's really shocking people. This movie shows different personality of people at different situation and it also shows that human can be kind eventhough the disaster is coming. The plot that shown in the is awesome. I think it perfectly return to the original condition in Rwanda and the facial expressions of every actor is just like they're in the disaster and facing the massacre. You can see disappoint, happy for all the member of their family become together and save, sad, shocking to the massacre. They're all super actor even the kids in the movie did a very great job.

This movie is so powerful, it reached down past the pit of my stomach in what it showed. Don Cheadle and the rest of the cast were tremendous. The scene on the foggy, bumpy road when the van was forced to stop, and the resulting scene that unfolded before Paul's disbelieving eyes was one of the most gut-wrenching horrors ever, likened to the carnage at Auschwitz. And just as real, as history has shown. This is a tale that the whole world should have seen while it was happening. And those who heard of it, and could have done something to stop it, but did nothing, are responsible for all the carnage. Unfortunately, we still live with similar slaughters every day all over the world. Kudos that at least some people continue to tell the stories and fight the fights.

Thinking, real thinking, is like kryptonite is to Superman for most people. So I knew something good had to be involved. This was a very dignified film in that it showed the nobility of a man (Paul) putting himself on the line for family and friends. When American television has shown me so many dumb parents and single parents to whom life is a materialistic game I found Paul Rusesabaginaas as refreshing as cold spring water in the desert. And even though I know the murders of so many people with machetes had to be a gruesome sight I appreciated not being subjected to the usual special effects waterfall of blood and gore. I believe it was a good thing that director Terry George was able to retain control and pick Don Cheadle for the lead role instead of someone like Will Smith. Smith is OK but would not have been the best choice for this part. Hotel Rwanda helps restore meaning to the word ""artistry"". It is an oasis in a celluloid wasteland. Everyone should see it.",

I will, especially to help those in Sudan. In Sudan, the Janjaweed troops: white Muslims are killing black Muslims. It is a similar situation in Hotel, a very painful movie describing in almost no graphic images, the horror on such an event as a genocide for no apparent reason. In the movie, nobody really knows who to trust, but Paul trusts only in himself and survives. Also on the DVD is a documentary about Paul returning from his new home in Belgium to his old country of Rwanda.

Hotel Rwanda was a truly moving film and I highly recommend it. Some of the scenes that were most moving were not even the ones that were graphic in nature. One of the most moving lines came from the Red Cross worker who was only a minor character. I didn't particularly want to the see this film but I am glad that I did.

This is a true story, so there is a serious problem inside this movie, Why we live together, but we killing each other, Why we can't left the history past, let the hatred past? We can't give yourself a superiority by the race and order the people should have equality with you, you will not give good result at the end, you will be punish someday. We cannot force other because you have large population and weapon, that is not superiority, this is guilty!
We need to say thanks to the hero that try everything to saving life and stand the side of justice. You maybe will lost you way in the crowd, everyone as same as you did choice so you didn't think, you just follow it, that's not terrible, if you don't change, that's horrible indeed.
Why don't you be nice? I thought in the movie because this is not humanity that killing by hatred, the people who is innocent get killed, and no body help them, the UN, the journalist, they struggled and making self-helping, if there is not a Hutu to confront Hutu rebels more people were died in this event.
Why don't you be nice? Maybe someone will ask nice in our real life, because there is someone did something bad to our society, although it is really serious like the genocide, but it will become big problem when it accumulate, I wish the people watched this movie can reflect and think their behave, do good thing, maybe you could be a hero like Paul, but please don't let yourself be a criminal like the General Bizimungu.",

542,13 June 2019,m-19367,8, peace and love,"The film Rwanda Hotel tells about the conflict between two races, Tutsi and Hutu. They have lived on the same land for many years. But later, in Hutu's view, the Tutsis were invaders of Belgian colonists. They plundered Hutu's land and flogged them. They called Tutsis ""cockroaches"" and ""murderers"". So they plan to drive Tutsis away and decide to ""eliminate cockroaches"". In this way, under the vigorous propaganda of Hutu Power Radio, a vicious massacre began.
After the signal of ""Cut down the tall trees!"" the Rwandan militias killed, set fire, smashed houses, etc., and drove the Tutsis to their death. Even the orphans in the orphanage did not let go, many people died. Rwanda has always been in a state of turmoil, which has attracted the attention of the United Nations. Therefore, it has long dispatched troops to mediate in order to maintain peace. However, when the massacre began, foreign troops stationed in Rwanda were withdrawn, and the only hope of the Tutsis was dashed. With Paul's strength, he offered bribes to officers many times. Finally, hundreds of Rwandan Hotel Reed were sent to safety, so they held their lives. Eventually, the massacre was stopped, the Tutsis were rescued, all reactionary activities stopped and peace replaced everything.
This is a war between nations. For a long time, the state has not handled the relationship between the two nationalities properly, has not implemented a reasonable national policy, and has not formulated a complete constitution of the national army, so the massacre occurred. In my opinion, there is no fundamental difference between Hutu and Tutsi. There is no cultural difference, no difference in customs, no need to be racial. Before the incident, Hutu and Tutsi were neighbors, colleagues, friends and lovers. There is no racial discrimination, not to mention the constraints of inter-ethnic interaction. However, after the Hutu incident, they lost their humanity, abandoned friendship, love and family, and carried out massacres irrationally.
Hutu people have always regarded Westerners as intruders, with the majority dominating, and the Tutsis have become ethnic minorities. Within a country, there must be different nationalities, just as there are different people in society. Such a country is a complete country. With the exchange of different nationalities, the culture can be integrated, and the country can have a long history. It is incorrect for Hutu people to expel and kill the Tutsis in order to remove their hatred. War is not the best way to solve all problems. War only brings pain to people. Peace will win war in the end. Hutu people should remember history, but they should strive for peace instead of rewriting it. In response to the massacre, the national government did not intervene in a timely manner and did not formulate a clear system for the management of the army. The national government can carry out regional national autonomy on issues between the two ethnic groups, and each ethnic group can elect its own leaders, which will eventually be under the unified management of the state. A complete set of ethnic policies has been formulated and strictly implemented after reaching consensus on the unity of all ethnic groups. It is essential to arouse people's patriotic and peaceful consciousness, strengthen national patriotic education, deepen cultural exchanges between the two nationalities, and make them live in harmony and peaceful coexistence.",

He is not bad, because they didn't kill Tutsi refugee, and they would not kill native people, but Hutu power also killed native people which didn't kill Tutsi.

The superb acting and real representations of how the genocide would be make the movie terrific. It's a very emotional movie and at some stages you find your self on the brink of tears. Other times your body is full of hatred towards those cruel and horrific Hutus. I highly recommend this movie as its an important part of understanding the cruelty of this world and learning to stop and do something to helps those struggling throughout the world.

We live in a fools world and of course that is the very best place for FOOLS to live.....................................",

548,5 October 2006,Starbits7,10, Excellent doesn't cover it,"I think Hotel Rwanda is a movie in a category of its own. It was so well done that it sent chills up my spine. It made me sickened, seeing the roads scattered with bodies, seeing the callousness of everyone in it. The whole world turned their backs on the country when it was in need. The movie did show, what I think, is an accurate account of how people acted during the time. I've only read one book about the genocide between the Hutsus and the Tutsis and that was more about the groups in Sri Lanka so it can't really be compared.",
549,5 January 2007,whatsnewpussycat187,9, Moving,"It took me along time to finally watch this film and now that i have, I am deeply moved, it is a film that captures so much that has happened to so many people. Myself having have lived in Kenya, east Africa for 17 years and my uncle having worked as a doctor in Rwanda during the genocide makes me proud that this film has been produced for the world to see. The Rwandan genocide was something that should never have happened and I am almost ashamed to live in a world where these things are overlooked. Hundreds of thousands of human beings were slaughtered unnecessarily and if you visit Africa today, there is no stopping another incident of genocide like this from happening again unless the world stops it this time.",
550,31 January 2007,cosmin2108,10, Above evil there's love,"I have just seen Hotel Rwanda and i will never forget it. Perhabs words are not enough to describe this movie but the story is absolutely incredible. Who would have thought that all those atrocities were ever possible in the late XX century? If that movie would not have been so successful maybe we would not know today about the events in Rwanda. It's sad that some people need to make great movies so that we can learn about good and evil, about what's right and what's wrong! Somehow we always forget about wars, about holocaust, about all the children killed for no reason, except the fact that they carry the blood of an undesired ethnic group. Watching the film today I felt I would so much preferred that I was dead so all those children in Rwanda would be alive today, not slaughtered like pigs. But I can not turn back the time. When the events happened I was 12, and at that time nobody informed us in the media about Rwanda. Till recently I did not know that in my country the Holocaust took one of its evil forms and I felt like I was a total ignorant. But I discovered that there are many like me, much many, and I think now it's my duty to tell everybody these events, ask them about their opinions and try to change these opinions if they agree with those of the manslaughterers from the movie.",
551,12 December 2021,abdouljtoure,9, The will to survive,"Hotel Rwanda is an incredible description of the human race. A development of a film of reality of separation of race and power. Hotel Rwanda was filmed/released in 2004 reflecting a true story of one of the deadliest rivalry between the Hutus and Tutsis. The genres is a biography, dram and history of war of the Hutus and Tutsis; Paul Rusesabagina who is played by Don Cheadle become in charge of Hotel Des Milles Collines in Kigali. The twist is that he is a Hutus and married to Tutsis played by Sophie Okonedo(Tatiana Rusesabagina).",

Insane is the word that most real Artists can decode, and most movie producers can decipher. We are on 21st century, and now almost everyone knows that the earth in spherical, not a flat surface. I campaigned for development of ""Sanity Test"" and the movie ""Hotel Rwanda"" is an exhibit to speed up this issues. There are public leaders and people who are voted in, or employed by big businesses to manipulate other's mind by their words and statutory influences. Just like the Radio broadcast crew and government/military leaders in Rwanda, most of our world leaders and national political presidents are very much insane.

NO ONE IS DIRT. NO ONE IS DUNG. this show inspired me beyond words and i highly doubt any movies i will be seeing to make me feel the way i feel now. being to watch such an incredible like this, made all the wait in my life in search for that perfect movie, is at last found.

Though IMDb classifies this Drama, Thriller, etc., the best way to sum up this movie would be Documentary - Interesting Documentary, to be exact. The movie definitely got its point across with unspeakable acting. It's wonderful for a class setting - in fact, I am a student that has watched it today in World History class.",
556,15 April 2005,totally_chicken,10, Moving Beyond Words,"I went into the movie knowing it was a tragic film, but coming back from it, I know now that it was much more than that. This film has moved me in ways that no movie has done for me in a long time. It shows us, who leisurely visit the movie theatres, how lucky we are and how much of the world's horrific events go unnoticed except to those who live in fear for their lives. Coming home, I don't think I will ever be able to look at a news report ever the same. Those few seconds of flickering light upon a screen from a news station will never fully convey the depth of the events being shown. What the news is, is really a medium to which we should be stimulated to seek the truth of the matter and hopefully be moved to do something or help in some way. To go and say that this film should have won a lot of awards and be heralded as the best film of the year would not do it justice. Don't get me wrong, the film and its cast and crew are incredible. But even without winning all the awards available, what WOULD give proper credit to this film is to have as many people see it as possible and hope that they, too, will be as moved to action as I am now.",

This film tells us no only how a man become holy in a very time and a very place,but also gives us so many questions to answer,that's the reason why i introduce this film!",
559,28 February 2008,Nourchick,8, Hotel Rwanda,"On April 7, 1994 conflict broke out in Kigali, Africa. It was an estimated 937,000 dead Tutsis and Hutus that were assassinated by Hutu extremists.The Movie Hotel Rwanda shows a generous hotel owner named Paul Rusesabagina helped refugees, he gave them a place to stay and food. Through my point of view I think this movie will be one to cry through. This movie shows us how thankful and grateful we are in the United States. For years in Rwanda under the Belgains, the Tutsis ruled and killed not but a few Hutus. Now the Hutus are in control, and armed troops creep around the nation, killing Tutsis.",

This all happened on April 7th, 1994. Over 800,000 Tutsi's died. The Hutu called the Tutsi's cockroaches.

562,10 May 2008,bijit_jit,10, How this movie differs from Schindler's List,"Hotel Rwanda definitely is a top grade movie.But what makes this movie so special is the way the African unrest in 1994 was portrayed.Unlike Schindler's List(which is another 10 on 10 movie)this movie do not have too many violent scenes, but still manages to maintain the intensity of the subject matter.Schindler's List captures a lot of violence and has a negative way of building the tempo and intensity of the movie, whereas, Hotel Rwanda has a very positive way of building the tempo and intensity of the movie by concentrating on incidents where lives were saved.To site an example, there is a sequence where Paul(Don Cheadle) thinks his wife and children have jumped off the roof and killed themselves instead of getting butchered by Hutu machetes.However, later he found his family was safe.In this sequence, even if it were shown that his family was killed, it would have added to the intensity and drama which was building up.But that would have been the negative approach.Another such sequence is when Paul finds his son behind a bush all covered up in blood.Here also it could have shown that it was his son who was attacked.But later it reveals that it was not the boy's blood,it was the blood of another victim killed in front of the boy.Here also ,once again,violence was minimized, but without losing the impact and the viewer can always feel the tension and horror going around.Also, instead of showing the incident on screen,there is a conversation between Paul and a Red Cross worker where she narrates a horrible incident she has seen: an orphan child from her orphanage butchered to death in front of her eyes.This passive way of creating the savage environment of the riot is commendable as this makes the movie open to people who do not like explicit violence.The movie actually used just one incident where a Paul Russessabagina saves 1300 people with the riot in its background. Unlike Schindler's List, it id not use the riot itself with the main incident as a part of it.Personally, I feel this movie is something that is bound to touch a viewer's heart and something which lingers in your mind for a long long time after you have watched the movie.Hat's off! 10 on 10!",
563,28 May 2008,magic_ravz,8," An powerful portrayal of genocide, some improvements though","Based on the true story, Hotel Rwanda is a film centred around the genocidal acts that took place in Rwanda during 1994. Don Cheadle gives a riveting performance as Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of a European-owned hotel in Rwanda, who created a secret refugee camp for the Tutsi people during the brutal genocide committed against them by the Hutu people. While the killing happened all that the western powers did was ignore this atrocity. Cheadle gives some terrific acting and this film really opens the eyes of the western world when they refused to open it during these events. If you liked the movie ""Shooting Dogs"", which involves almost identical events but in a Rwandan school, you will enjoy this movie. The gripping tension in some of the key scenes keeps you on the edge of your seat. There is an all-star cast with cameos from Jean Reno and Joaquin Phoenix. However, I would not rate this 5 star as the cruel acts could be have been shown a bit more. I do not mean that it has to be vile and a gore-fest. But to really have a more deeper impact on the audience, a few more scenes could be used to show how the Tutsis were killed.",

It is about a hotel manager who is just doing his duty as a human being and in turn he save over 1200 innocent lives of elderly, adults, adolescents, and children. This movie is a must watch. I would highly recommend everyone to watch this movie at least once. The message that this movie gives out to the viewer is that everything/every person, no matter how big or small, no matter how rich or poor, is important for life on this earth. After watching the movie, one quickly realizes that we are all human beings, deep down inside, we all want the same thing- love, peace, and happiness, and that we are all just one race- the HUMAN RACE. Let there be peace on this Earth and let us all live in harmony. God Bless the Earth.",
