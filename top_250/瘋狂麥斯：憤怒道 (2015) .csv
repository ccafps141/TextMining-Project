0,24 February 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, Pure action spectacle,"MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is the finest piece of pure action spectacle that I've watched since THE RAID 2 and JOHN WICK. It feels like the MAD MAX film that George Miller always wanted to make, and in many ways it's a virtual remake of MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR, except with a grossly inflated budget and CGI effects used to enhance rather than dominate. Now, I love THE ROAD WARRIOR and always will, but MAD MAX: FURY ROAD truly is an action film for our times.",/
1,3 October 2015,ivo-cobra8,10, Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015. Mad Max: Fury Road is the finest blockbuster of 2015!,"When I wrote this review 3 years ago I had no idea how many people hate this movie and they are preferring Mad Max 3 over this film. Claming Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome the third film is better film than this, really? Better than this? Listen folks it has no Mel Gibson so what? So what's your point? Gibson dropped out this film and he wasn't interested, it was in development for years, since in 2004 this movie was announced. George Miller did something different with this film and he got hate for it. I hate Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome to death! It is rated PG-13 family film and I wanted an action bloody rated R film not a boring stupid lame fu**** movie! I got an rated R bloody action film that I wanted in Mad Max: Fury Road. I was entertained and I enjoy it. ",r
2,12 October 2015,Hitchcoc,5, It Never Stops,"I have to say that I tried really hard to like this. But my old fashioned ""There needs to be a story and interesting characters"" mode took over. It took about fifteen minutes to figure out who was who. Apparently, the guy with the death mask and the tubes was seen as a god, that there was some religious following. Could be interesting, I guess. But what follows is one chase after another with every conceivable vehicle that some guy could dream up. There were porcupine cars. Monster trucks. Guys on poles dropping into vehicles. There was no logic presented as to why one vehicle would have a spear thing thrown at it and explode while others were hit with heavy artillery and seemed to move on just fine. Then we have Mad Max who is a captive with a mask that looks like a 1955 Oldsmobile grill. He is put on the front of a vehicle as all this combat goes on. Unfortunately, he has absolutely no personality whatsoever. There was never any suspense in this film because the place they were trying to get to was never really in our mind's eye. Then there's the short crop haired female which seems to be a standard these days. Make her look masculine and she becomes more formidable. Anyway, it is spectacular to look at but when it was over I felt no emotion or satisfaction at all.",e
3,7 August 2015,Uriah43,5, Extremely Inflated,"Like the previous ""Mad Max"" movies this film takes place in a future desert world which has been devastated by a nuclear war. What remains of humanity is both primitive and barbaric and those who have survived exist with the most basic of necessities in war-like fortresses where few laws exist. That being the case, after being taken as a prisoner, it is to one of these harsh enclaves that ""Max"" (Tom Hardy) is subsequently forced to endure. And since life has very little value Max ends up as nothing more than a human blood bank for one of the militaristic ""War Boys"" by the name of ""Nux"" (Nicholas Hoult). It's at this same time that one of the military leaders named ""Imperator Furiosa"" (Charlize Theron) decides to escape from this citadel and she takes with her five wives of the religious leader, ""Immortan Joe"" (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Soon all of the clans in the entire area are summoned to assist in the recapture of Imperator Furiosa with both Nux and his captive Max in hot pursuit and leading the charge. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that those who enjoy films which feature action from start to finish will really appreciate this picture. However, it is this strength which also happens to be the films weakness as there is very little room for anything else. That said, I thought the talents of both Tom Hardy--and in particular Charlize Theron--were terribly wasted. Likewise, I also believe that the current IMDb score of 8.4 (whether by chance or design) is extremely inflated as well. To that end, I would hope that once the initial euphoria has subsided realism will set in and the score will more closely resemble the film's actual merits. Time will tell. In any case, while I certainly do not believe that this particular film is deserving of scores equal to classics like ""Gone with the Wind"", I also don't consider this to be a bad movie either. Accordingly, while my score may not be popular at this time I have rated this movie as I see it. Average.",v
4,10 September 2015,planktonrules,8, Well made and mindlessly entertaining....,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is not the sort of film I enjoy and I after watching it, I am not a huge fan though I deeply respect the filmmakers. The reason I even saw it was the insane reaction the public had to this one...and the critical reviews were all surprisingly good. I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about...and try to understand why folks liked it so much. My take on it is that if you enjoy a film that is non-stop amazing action, then this one is for you. As far as the story goes, it's plot is super-thin--but the movie is handled so well and the stunts so amazingly insane that you don't mind. Worth seeing--but I sure wouldn't like to see a lot of films like this. Additionally, it was VERY refreshing to see a film where so many women are NOT mindless objects to be killed or protected--several are about as strong and heroic as Max himself--and no doubt this is why women seemed to like the film so much.",i
5,12 July 2020,cutesd,7, It's a whole lot of style and not much substance,I realize a lot of people will disagree with me ... but personally ...

6,13 May 2015,stephendaxter,10, An absolutely insane action film that will blow you away,"Mad Max Fury Road is George Miller's return to the franchise he started way back in 1979 with Mad Max. I will start by saying this movie was absolutely batsh** insane. It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn't have much of a plot at all but seriously you're not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn't even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don't, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful.

7,16 May 2015,confrank,10, Mad Max Fury Road: A statement to embarrass and destroy all other movies in the action genre,"Mad Max: Fury Road, starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, is George Miller's attempt to reignite his long dormant Mad Max franchise...and my god does he ever. For the past decade or so, with exceptions such as John Wick, The Bourne Trilogy, and The Raid, action movies seem to be struggling to capture the excitement and enjoyment the genre once held; a tenacity that classics from the 80's and 90's had in spades. George Miller single handedly delivers our saving grace with Fury Road on the back of a spike covered oil rig with a blind zombie playing a fire breathing electric guitar.",/
8,17 August 2015,claudio_carvalho,5, Terrible and Overrated Sequel,"The former policeman Max (Tom Hardy) is captured by the War Boys tribe, commanded by the Immortal Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and assigned to be blood donor for the Wat Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult) that is sick. Meanwhile Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) drives a tank truck to collect gasoline for Joe. However her truly intention is to flee from the tyrannic Joe with his five women selected to breed hidden in the truck to her homeland. Immortal Joe commands a party to hunt down Furiosa and Max is chained to Nux's car. Furiosa heads the truck to a sand storm but Nux continues to pursuit her. After the storm, Max succeeds to release from the car and brings Nux chained with him. He sees Furiosa and the five wives and decides to flee in their truck; but there is a secret to operate the truck and he teams up with Furiosa, leaving Nux on the desert. When Joe's gang arrives, they retrieve Nux and follow Furiosa. Will Max and she succeed to escape from Joe's gang? ",r
9,13 May 2015,prospectus_capricornium,9, Dark Yet Visually Exhilarating. Beautifully Brutal and Yet Still Visceral,"Even at the beginning, there's no hint MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is going to a stop. Right at the very start, the engines are already rewing, gathering furious fires of vengeance and redemption, and before the audience could snap out of the sheer moments of brutal grittiness and exhilarating high-octane drama, they are surely already held hostage within the confines of a post-apocalyptic world, where everything is horrendously scarce. Not that it's a bad thing, no it's not. I tell you, this is like being hurled into the space in a roller-coaster ride. It's dangerous, but it's also thrilling. Witnessing this dystopic world and all its hellish drama unfold might make you grope for seatbelt under your seat.",w
10,14 May 2015,punishable-by-death,9," A blockbuster that dark, gritty, brutal and bloody? Right here.","I was left speechless when this finished. It can be hard to describe  indeed.... but I'll go for it...  Sheer madness that isn't sullied by bad acting or laughable lines. A  blockbuster that is gritty and doesn't have a sense of humour that  could be equated to a fluffy kitten. No 'lets all hug' sentimental BS.  This is seriously a movie I thought I'd never see: a CGI-filled  blockbuster that I flat out loved. The stunts are so much fun, the FX  so great, it is the first movie I have seen where I have thoroughly  enjoyed all this type of stuff - probably because the cinematography  for once doesn't suffer cos of it. It is all incredibly shot.  The action is so brutal and appropriately high-octane. I thought to  myself more than once, 'I think I am loving this more than Terminator  2' but other than that, there wasn't time to think. It kicked off fast  and barely stopped, and the lulls were amplified by the insanity  preceding them. Plus it is a dark film, which made it even better. I  many people do an Aussie accent even close to well, was Hardy actually  trying for that? Either way, he didn't talk much so it didn't really  matter. This is more Theron's movie than Hardy's, he doesn't say much  and does next to nothing for the first third or so. Theron's Furiosa is  more of the hero is the story, if there were to be a hero in such a  grisly and dark world.  I don't even like this type of movie but the execution is  everything. I'm gonna go see this again, soon. 4.5/5",3
11,14 August 2021,AlsExGal,5, I felt my boomerism rising up while watching this..,Because my first reaction is to HATE HATE HATE this film. It's like an overly long David Bowie music video in its weirdness without Bowie's great music and great style.,4
12,2 December 2015,phd_travel,2, An endless ugly chase in the desert,I just don't get the praise for this movie. The straight launch into fighting and chasing doesn't let one feel for the characters or identify with them. Lots of gross creatures chase each other in disgusting vehicles along the endless desert.,4
13,6 June 2015,Theo Robertson,6, Nothing More Than A Noisy Blockbuster,"I love post apocalyptic fiction . John Wyndham and John Christopher are amongst my favourite authors . They weave compelling stories of average everymen surround by a hostile landscape where it's every man for himself and only the cruelest and most heartless survive . George Miller's MAD MAX films are an extention of this . Low brow cinematic spectacle but fair as entertainment goes . And let's not forget hugely influential as well . Sadly the films' influence found itself being transplanted in nearly every post apocalypse story for the next 20 years where a brooding loner , a man of few words , drives through a desert landscape doing his best to survive in a hostile world against scavengers . Influntial but rather unimaginative and the movies probably did the sub-genre more harm than good . This reboot did capture my imagination via the trailers and so decided to give the film a chance , not least because as soon as it was released it shot to number 25 on the IMDb Top 250 ",8

15,16 May 2015,Imaculata,9," Beyond Thunderdome on acid, with a huge budget","I see a lot of negative reviews for this movie popping up. People complaining that there is a lack of story and character development, and too much action.... too much action? Really? Have these people never seen a Mad Max movie before? How is that a bad thing in a Mad Max movie? Fury Road feels like an 80's action movie, with a preposterously large budget, and it is GLORIOUS. This movie was an epic ride. So many awesome set pieces, incredible car designs, twisted and bizarre costumes and characters, and a lot of really strong warrior women as well.",9
16,29 March 2022,david-meldrum,10, Magnificently Unhinged,"A film that deals in scorched earth landscapes and scorched retina viewers, this film - large parts of which were shot in the Namibian desert - must have been hell to make, but the result is gleefully unhinged, visually stunning and utterly relentlessly thrilling. Tom Hardy may have played the lead role, but the film belongs to Charlize Theron's blistering intensity, director George Miller's crazed vision and every single technical expert who worked on it.

20,26 January 2016,TheOneThatYouWanted,3, What's wrong with you people? This is lame at best,"I feel like I am the only person on planet earth who didn't like Fury Road. It is basically a movie about a guy making a U-turn. I'll admit, the visuals are great but I've seen most of George Miller's films and he has an eye, but just because the movie looks pretty doesn't make it a good movie. It needs a real story. This is a 2 hour car chase and it gets boring after 30 minutes because it is literally the same crap over and over again. In a way, the action is wasted on the film because it has nothing but action. I can't be the only person who thinks this! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE? This isn't art! Stop pretending to be film snobs for like 5 minutes and just go with what your gut tells you about the film. Just because most of the film critics are calling this a highbrow art house film doesn't mean you have to go against your better judgement and pretend to like this piece of waste. 90% of the critics are paid off. Even the ones on youtube. Think for yourself, people will respect you more.",e

22,10 January 2016,bjarias,5," Very sad... unbelievably, this leads the Rotten Tomato list of the top 100 movies of 2015 !!","So to date it's easily more than doubled the $150 million spent to make it.. and in addition looks like they might have found a replacement for Mel (who's still the best Max by far). So we can now all be sure we'll be seeing more of this very worn out series. Passing off two solid hours of pretty much nothing but constant, mind-numbing crashes and explosions is now what we all have to look forward to in the future. There was not much acting required for this production because there really was not much of any storyline to tell in this overly bland script. But maybe it will make some of the younger generation go back and look at several of the previous works. They might not have been as action packed as this monstrosity... but they were overall much more consistently interesting viewing.",_

It's absolutely glorious. As far as sci-fi world goes, director George Miller creates a remorseless realm with every bit of nastiness present.

25,11 July 2015,justinwfirestone,3, Don't believe the hype,"George Miller has proved you don't need to actually make a movie in order to make money making movies. You see, movies typically have certain key features, such as: a plot, dialogue, and character development (all of which are absent here). And is George Miller now just Frank Miller with a different hat?",t
26,11 May 2015,sukhmanjitcheema,10, A masterpiece on a massive scale.,"George Miller returns with a bang and takes the helm of this crazy 2hr bonkers extravaganza named Mad Max: Fury Road. First of all, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. The story opens, with Immortan Joe who has young ladies as his wives, but he'll goes down when they escape the sadist's hands. Max, who has a violent past with Joe's cronies, decides to help Imperior Furiosa take the girls somewhere safe. Furiosa can't trust Max, and neither can he. So it all comes down to Joe's cronies fighting against them reaching to their destination. The movie is a bananas car chase for the runtime, as Max and Furiosa work together to fight against the evils. And then, there is Nux, a bonkers ""really skin coloured"" guy, who works with Joe, played well by Nicholas Hoult. The 3D really pays off, and is worth the extra ticket. The movie puts all other action movies of shame, the effects really pop out. Well, this is a definite masterpiece. One of the best movies of the year, one of the best action movies ever made and the role of Theron's life. Miller is truly a mastermind as stated clearly in the trailer. This exceeded my expectations, and will exceed yours as well. The dark style, dark comedy and the over the top characters make a return in this reboot. Must watch, and worth the extra IMAX 3D ticket.",_
27,24 June 2015,mike_brunton,1, A travesty of the original Mad Max movies,"I will be honest with readers. I only really watched the first 30 minutes of this Hollywood blockbuster. What I did do before I settled down to watch it, was look at the rating on IMDb. 8.6 out of 10!! This must be great, like many other reviewers, I believe my low rating is a reaction to the absolute travesty that many movies are being rated so highly. The original Mad Max movies had a young and charismatic, unknown Australian actor called Mel Gibson in them. They had some plot and believability. This had so much money thrown at it, supposedly around $150 million, that the whole world view of Mad Max was gone. Hundreds of vehicles driving around in the desert. A community of thousands, with clearly no problem with water or food, even though the baddie turns on the water and lets in pour into the sand and then turns it off, and tells his people not to become addicted to water ??? Words are failing me, to describe how badly I feel. Any young people out there reading this, should watch Mad Max 1-2, skip the Hollywood version, thunderdome. Honestly, once again left speechless with the true awfulness of this film.",u

30,2 May 2017,denis888,1, Hated Every Second Of This Abomination,"How to make a really awful, mind-numbing, horrid, puking, cringeworthy, hateful, silly, stupid, sick, marred, sub-par, flawed, blemishful movie? Make one with no plot, with several absolutely out of place looking models, with endless rushing and racing, with endless violence and with endless explosions. Add blood, add silly costumes, add ugly freaks galore, add oil spills, add sand and add unwanted and unsuitable sexy innuendos. This is what you get - awful Mad Max, which leaves a profound shock of wasted time and a feeling of being had by. Even beautiful models like Kershaw or Whiley or Kravitz, even fine actresses like Theron could not save this monstrosity from being a whole, complete, total, wholesome flop on all sides. This is an example of a horrible, totally ugly and unpardonably silly failure which made some cash and was praised. I do not dig this sick liking of sick films. I do not recommend this awful idiocy to anybody",
31,13 October 2015,deloudelouvain,7, Mad Max is back,"What to say about a movie like this one? It's easy. If you expect a difficult dramatic story then you are not going to like it. But if you expect an action movie about a whole lot of modified vehicles trying to take over a big modified truck in the middle of nowhere, with creepy looking humans, then you are going to love it. And that's what I was going to expect. I like movies like this one where you just relax and let the action come to you. Not all the time but sometimes I do enjoy a movie like Mad Max. The amateurs of steam punk will also like this one because almost everybody in this movie is strangely looking. The filming itself was good, the script is like I said what it is. It should not have been difficult to write that script. The actors all did their job like they should. Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy are the main characters and they are good actors.

33,16 May 2015,NateWatchesCoolMovies,10," A chrome plated, nitrous injected masterpiece!","George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road. I don't even know where to begin. First of all, forget Avengers, forget Furious 7, this is THE movie to see this summer, and perhaps this decade. It is a nitrous injected, chrome plated masterpiece of savage beauty and reckless juggernaut aerobatics that has to be seen to be believed. Miller has taken the core elements of what made his Road Warrior so special and beloved, and kicked them into high gear for a revisionist take on the ages old post apocalyptic punk warrior desert chase film. Tom Hardy is hysterical as Max, a brooding, bruised hearted grump who just wants to be left alone, until he's dragged, literally into a deranged odyssey through the badlands. Charlize Theron is all rock solid tough as Imperator Furiosa, who hijacks the five breeding wives of tyrannical, terrifying warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keayes Byrne, Toecutter from the first Max film) and flees into the desert to find a greener place away from the madness. Miller strips away any unnecessary dialogue or clichéd 'getting to know you scenes' and streamlines the film into one sleek, forward surging force of nature, with not a moment wasted, and not a line of dialogue or glare of the eyes that isn't somehow in service of the constant 'go, go, go' mantra of the story. Such pacing is the genius of what makes it such a thrill. Also amazing is the imagination and world building. Miller uses an anthropologists eye to look at what the human mind, and civilization would evolve to in a situation like this, resulting in every character having a realistic, thought through vernacular, and some truly phenomenal, lived in style set pieces that are truly eye popping. Such attention and care is rare in this genre. Miller and team have outdone themselves with this absolutely exhilarating film, technically proficient in every way and filled to the brim with the kind of love for films and telling stories that its predecessors revels in back then.",

36,24 May 2015,donaldthane,1, On Par for Modern Hollywood Remakes (Meaning it Stinks),"First off, this is another movie in which the action sequences last so long that you can go to the bathroom, get a soda, come back and still find the same people fighting the same fights you saw begin 15 minutes earlier. Personally, these type of action movies bore me to tears, because the story has to stop moving every time we watch one of these extended action sequences. In terms of story, the good guys and the bad guys meeting is a plot point. Then they fight, then one of them wins. As an audience member, I'm ready to know who wins as soon as they start fighting.

This one, like the first 3 films, we get to suspend disbelief as the movie projects, thrusting us into the post-apocalyptic world, with anthropological and sociological elements we could believe it. Don't get me wrong, this movie is the best of the series, the unforgivable. Mad Max and The Road Warrior were convincing in it's tribalism, brutality and uncompromising violence I'm sure is true is burned into my survivalist memory. I'm not a hater, but massive dune buggies, rock playing mutants and an oxygen breathing madman? No way. Miller, you messed up bad. What happened to Max, a ""shell of a man"" who hasn't quite lost his humanity, only long forgotten and buried it. In this way this movie pisses me off, in the same way ""The Phantom Menace"" did.

Perhaps it was the Mad Max of old and my nostalgia for that world but this was so different and less real than the world of the original Max. Max was leaden. He seemed almost irrelevant and I couldn't care for him. Furiousa was better and brought some interest to the adventure. Nux was just Nicholas Hoult in bad make-up.

Whoever directed this should go to director's school. I think Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron needed a paycheck. Worse they probably did not read the scripts before saying yes.

This movie had shades of Total Recall)... 12 year old boys should like this movie ... When Furiosa walked sadly into the desert and took off her robot arm that was very poorly done... I wanted to scoff out loud but I didn't because I was in a theater... but I'm sure many there would have appreciated it... I see in the user review section that there are a significant number of equally bad reviews... thank you to those intelligent members of the IMDb community for the support... so I don't think I'm insane as Mad Max too for not liking a popular movie...

56,29 July 2015,djangozelf-12351,2, They should have named it mad Maxine,"Max is minus in this film and gets outplayed easily by Charlize Theron and I guess the director was so glad to have her that she's by far the most interesting character of this action only flick. The story only serves to connect the action sequences which are abundant but after a while you sort of get numb to everything that is displayed before your eyes. This becomes even more clear when they turn around and do the whole thing over again stretching the film even longer and adding absolutely nothing. It had some interesting ideas but all of that never gets of the ground and the realness is lost because the genuine gritty Australian actors of the first 3 installments are replaced by Americans who seem to have no connection with the dystopian desert they're living in. Also the rough straight up violence is changed to a Chinese circus version making everything feel really choreographed and there for fake so you don't feel the tension that was done so well in the original trilogy. The CGI dust storm was the point I should have hit the stop button but I was somewhat hoping things would get better when Hardy gets freed from the mouthpiece stuck to his face,but sadly it didn't.Theron brings some weight to this but the other characters are so laughable which made it all just some what painful to watch. I simply can not understand that a director who made these masterpieces before now goes out in this way and kills his own creation. I strongly suggest his next film should be a parody titled, mad Maxine: blurry road. Which is the road the writers were on when they wrote this abomination.",

(At least in my opinion.) However, to call this ""The Best Movie of the Year"" or ""A Masterpiece"" that's kinda stretching it isn't it? Seriously, what's so great about this movie? Were the critics watching a different movie from the one than I did? Originally, I wasn't going to write a review for this movie, but after seeing so many raving reviews for this film on the internet, and seeing the absurdly high rating this movie has here on IMDb, I felt that I had to say SOMETHING! Even if my hopes of knocking this movie down a point or two are completely moot, then at least I would've accomplished something by saying how much I hated this film, and add my voice to the small minority of people on this site that believe that this movie is nothing more than an over-hyped, overrated snore-fest. While watching this movie I fell asleep. Yes! This movie, with it's ""Thrilling action scenes!"" and ""Provocative visuals!"" Actually put me to sleep! I would go into the plot now, but I don't think this movie has one. At least not while I was awake. Furthermore, Mad Max, the supposed ""Main Character"" in this film, has no reason for even being in the film! Why call this film ""Mad Max: Fury Road"", if Mad Max himself has no motivations, or stake into what's going on? And for that matter, why even use the character of Mad Max at all? If you were gonna go that way with it, why not have Mel Gibson appear in a 10-15 minute cameo as an older Mad Max? From what I saw, there was nothing good about this movie. I probably would've been more entertained staring at a wall for two hours. Congratulations George Miller, you've accomplished something that only Rob Zombie and M. Night Shyamalan have been able to do: Cure my insomnia! I present to you, your awards: My middle finger, and a long, loud, raspberry! Bravo A$$hole!",

It might be unfair to filmmakers who may just love to hear their characters talk. and dialog-driven films can be made cinematic in the right hands. But what I mean to say is that George Miller really would have been perfectly at home working during the silent era, when all you needed to show were images of things happening, frenetically with the occasional dialog, to get your point across. I've seen Fury Road twice in a week and I have to wonder if Miller really wanted to be Buster Keaton or Abel Gance when he was going to the movies.

91,27 May 2015,troyputland,10, Absolutely stunning cinema.,"Mad Max: Fury Road is a visually stunning masterpiece by George Miller. It's been 30 years since Miller's last project: the last of the original Mad Max films, starring Mel Gibson. Comparisons cannot be made as I've yet to watch them. There are no excuses. Max's crazy adventure may not take him very far, but the world in which he resides is imaginative. The vast wasteland surrounding small territories show how bleak everything has become. Water is sparse and saved for the main cretin and his crew. Weird, cult-like followers, with their bald heads, white painted bodies and addiction to silvery substance, follow his orders. There's no sign of any nature, only a rumour of a place populated by trees and running water. Theron's barbaric-looking Furiosa, with her metal arm and gigantic tanker, thwarts her bosses' orders and steals that which is most precious to him. Immortan Joe (Keays-Byrne) gathers his whole force in pursuit. What emanates is a fantastically frenzied chase across the desert. MM:FR is full of insane car chases (the cars are a sight to behold in themselves), incredible explosions and well thought-out action. The 3D isn't necessary; only one part stands out in particular and the story is only strong enough to keep the action expressive. Max (Hardy), with his gruff voice and limited dialogue, is secondary to Furiosa. His serenity and coldness towards others makes him the perfect character to explore. Flashes of his family, from a world once known, haunt him constantly. Mad Max: Fury Road isn't just creative and captivating to the very end, it sets up potential for expansion.

It is brilliantly filmed with amazing, and well suited bombastic soundtrack. The star of the film is its direction by George Miller, showing generation MTV how to direct moving action without getting lost in its mayhem. Almost every shot is moving, similar to a James Cameron action sequence. As mentioned before the film has not got much of a plot other then a giant chase. The first half of the film is great and the second half starts to loose steam due to what has come before it. Chalize Theron is great and adds presence to the film, it is one of her best performances. Tom Hardy gives a solid performance but I found his performance somewhat lacking, he does not have much to work with and is limited to a handful of dialogue, I preferred Mel Gibson's Max. The film suffers when it eventually slows down in pace, but when it is going full throttle there are not many films that can complete with it. Is it an action classic? as a chase film , yes I would say it is, along with set design and stunt work involved But the lack of any real story and small plot holes stop me giving this film a 10, not much is explained in the film.

This one takes place between the road warrior and beyond the thunderdome. First off this movie is beautiful, every single shot looks fantastic. It looks like a painting. The visuals in this are also so beautiful, almost the whole movie is practical effects and you can see in the action scenes that this real. Like the old ones there isn't much dialogue, just pure action. The acting is great. Tom Hardy plays a great max, of course Mel Gibson well always be the best max but Tom does a great of carrying that character. The one character who Steals every scene is Charlize Theron's character Imperator Furiosa. Every scene she's in, she's just kills it. The action is unbelievable. George miller knows how to shoot old school action and he does not disappoint. Even we there's 50 cars on the screen, you can see perfectly what's happen. This movie is worth paying the ticket for IMAX 3D. This makes George miller a mastermind and the whole movie a masterpiece. Overall mad max fury road was was a crazy fun, non-stop action movie with great character development. Defiantly a movie that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible.

123,16 May 2015,trvlers-77920,10, 10/10,"The trailer alone — a 2 1/2-minute thrill ride of flying vehicles and fiery skies — screams with visceral images that sear into your brain and suggest that this must be a masculine and muscular cinematic extravaganza typical of the season. So what a lovely surprise it was on this lovely day to find that ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a fiercely feminist declaration of independence — pure hearted, passionate and full of beautifully realized moments of poignancy. Yes, it's as bad-ass as you've heard: powerful yet fluid, gritty yet crisp, sublime in the daring originality of its action sequences and flat-out gorgeous to watch. Just when you think that Miller, as director and co-writer, has topped himself with a grand and gripping set piece, he goes even more gloriously over the top with the next. Believe all the hype: This movie will melt your face off. See it on the biggest screen you can possibly find with the best possible sound, because this is a complete sensory experience. There's one image that was so vividly gnarly, it made me jump out of my seat and grab the shoulder of the friend sitting next to me. (Sorry, Amy.) And yet it conveys an underlying humanity in exquisite and convincing ways. Perhaps this stands out even more because it exists in such an outlandish wasteland. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a movie in which men initially seem to dominate, but eventually it reveals that it's truly about strong women fighting for each other, fighting for survival, fighting for the future. Hardy, as Max, becomes a passenger both literally and figuratively. This is truly Charlize Theron's film. As the fearless and unflappable Imperator Furiosa, Theron has given us a supreme action heroine for the ages. With her shaved head, greased face, a steam punk-inspired mechanical arm and an endless arsenal within the war rig she drives, she's an intimidating and resourceful protector. Theron has shirked her gorgeous looks previously (in her Oscar- winning performance in ""Monster"") and she's dared to play truly unlikable characters (in ""Young Adult"" and ""Snow White and the Huntsman""). Here, there's a beauty to her ferocity, a regalness to her statuesque demeanor and — ultimately — a tenderness and vulnerability which are heartbreaking. It's no hyperbole to say she's right up there with Sigourney Weaver in the ""Alien"" franchise and Linda Hamilton in the ""Terminator"" films. Although the film is told from Max's perspective in the script from Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris, Furiosa is the one who's truly driving the story in myriad ways. This isn't really a sequel to the three previous movies — the low-budget ""Mad Max"" (1979), the hugely influential ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" (1981) and the Tina Turner-tastic ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" (1985) — nor is it a remake. You could call it a reboot, but that makes it sound reheated. ""Fury Road"" fits squarely within the series mythology but it's wildly vibrant and a true original. Former police officer Max Rockatansky is running from his past, from both the living and the dead as he says in a low, rumbling voice-over. From the first richly over saturated images of Max surveying the unforgiving desert landscape that lies before him — Oscar-winner John Seale is responsible for the stunning cinematography — his sense of isolation is palpable. But this ultimate loner and rebel finds himself an unwitting pawn at the Citadel, a fortress carved out of the side of a mountain where the grotesque tyrant Immortan Joe rules completely through a twisted cult of personality. In a neat bit of casting, the actor playing Joe is Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the villainous motorcycle gang leader the Toecutter in the original ""Mad Max."" (He's still creepy as hell all these years later, in case you were wondering.) When Joe's most trusted driver, Theron's Furiosa, veers off course and goes rogue during a routine run to Gas Town, the chase is on, and the imprisoned Max is right in the thick of it. He's strapped to the grill of a car driven by the jacked-up and thoroughly unstable Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a War Boy who foolishly believes his loyalty to the sadistic Joe will land him a spot in Valhalla. Shaved and painted a blinding white like the rest of Joe's minions, the usually handsome Hoult is a frightening sight to behold. But his appearance also suggests an innocence — an infancy, almost — which makes him an unexpectedly sympathetic figure. (Lesley Vanderwalt was in charge of the inspired hair and makeup design; meanwhile, Oscar- winner and multiple nominee Jenny Beavan provided the artfully rough-hewn costume design, which couldn't be farther away from the clothes she made her name on in classic Merchant- Ivory films like ""A Room With a View"" and ""Howards End."") Actually, calling what Nux is driving a ""car"" suggests something you've seen before. These are the remnants of society, slapped together and souped up for survival in dystopia: muscle cars on top of tanks, vintage cars on top of oil rigs and things that look like killer porcupines with wheels underneath them. The level of detail is dazzling over and over again, and the tactile thrill of practical effects provides great joy and a real connection — especially during blockbuster season when so much of what we see is the product of glossy CGI. And that's basically the entire plot: One big, long chase across the desert. What happens along the way is awesome, frightening, deeply strange and darkly funny, but it's never less than jaw-dropping and it's constantly surprising. A sequence that takes place entirely within a wall of swirling dirt and piercing lighting will leave you breathless; a quieter moment amid barren trees and blue moonlight provides an unshakable melancholy. The score from Tom Holkenborg (a.k.a. Junkie XL) provides just the right tone each time: propulsive here, introspective there.",

131,28 May 2015,Coventry,10, Oh it's such a lovely day! I'm glad I spent it with Max!!,"I am honestly not that generous with my 10/10 ratings, I assure you, and yet this is the third film (out of four) in the ""Mad Max"" franchise that I awarded with a well-deserved 10/10 rating! Next to the low-budgeted but tense and progressive 1979 original and the phenomenal 1981 ""The Road Warrior"", ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is the third bona fide & unhinged masterpiece in the series. Only ""Mad Max beyond Thunderdome"" I rated a little bit lower, due to a weaker second half, but even that one was highly enjoyable. All this makes ""Mad Max"" one of the greatest – perhaps even THE greatest – movie franchises in history. It doesn't matter that this fourth installment only reaches us nearly three decades after the others, and it doesn't even matter that a new lead actor depicts the legendary titular character George Miller's dystopian post- apocalyptic world perspective is still 100% perplexing, adrenalin- rushing and mind-blowing! From start to finish, ""Fury Road"" is a high-octane (pun intended) Sci-Fi/thriller adventure with nightmarish characters, dazzling stunt work, incredibly insane plot situations and – guaranteed – the most grotesquely imaginative set designs (vehicles, base camps, death traps) ever created. And you know what is the best part of this all? Almost everything in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is real! By that I mean real stunt work with manually manufactured vehicles that are driven by real tough guys – and gals – in authentic desert locations, instead of computer engineered effects or cast members stupidly miming in front green screens. Lone drifter Max Rockatansky roams around in an uncivilized wasteland, regularly haunted by hallucinations featuring the restless spirits of his deceased wife and child, and gets captured by the minions of the tyrannical self-declared demigod Immortan Joe. This creepy dictator is about to be double-crossed by the rough gal Furiosa, who secretly hid Immortan Joe's beautiful ""breeding"" girls in her massive fuel truck and plans to take them to the green oasis where she was born. Joe sends his War Boys after them, an army of sickly albino freaks that practically orgasm whenever Immortan Joe even looks at them. The most ambitious War Boy is Nux and he chases Furiosa with Max attached to him as a living blood bag! There are many sub plots, twists, turns and bizarre escalations, but they are all worth discovering. The most fantastic thing about ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" are the downright marvelous vehicle-designs. I swear, the people who thought up and created the cars and trucks for this film are real geniuses for sure! There are trucks with the coachwork of Volkswagen Beetles, Monster trucks with old Mercedes coachwork processed into them, pick-ups with caterpillars, sand buggies covered with metal spikes and many, many more. Perhaps the craziest gimmick of them all is a War Boy with a rock guitar that is attached to a truck, and his only reason of existence is to incite the rest of the troops. The almighty George Miller also penned down some of the most nightmarish yet intriguing supportive characters, like Corpus Colossus (the deformed midget son of Immortan Joe), The People Eater (a creep that constantly rubs his own nibbles) and The Bullet Farmer. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is cinema in its purest form. See it! And don't just wait for the DVD or for the film to appear on Netflix or whatever. This is a film you have to experience at the cinema, on a gigantic screen with the best possible sound effects. Sheer brilliance",

The story was non- existent and the character were more like caricatures. So that left only the action to make it an okish movie (if the action was really superb), but even that disappointed me. The action felt both too fast and too long. From the very first action scene I thought that my computer was playing the movie at a quickened pace, but nope, the action is portrayed in a slightly sped up manner. The stylization of the action scenes was boring (besides some lovely colour-scheming), and the ""cool"" vehicles look like what a 6 year old would want out of a movie.

When characters start talking and sharing their backstory. It reminded me of those movies I used to watch as a kid, where everybody was searching for that special place, where everything was like it used to be, and blah blah blah... They tried the 80s/90s blockbuster approach, but it had been made too often already. The fact that the aesthetic looked exactly like that of a bad, same time pop artist, two hours video clip. Didn't help either. Take away the dialogue, and replace it with music, and you'd still understand what is happening onscreen. If that's your definition of a masterpiece, good for you. It clearly isn't mine. More so that, nothing add up with the rest of the franchise. And this « sequel », even... Is Max a popular name in post-apocalyptic America?

138,25 October 2019,MrPupkin,9, One of the greatest action films of all time.,"Mad Max: Fury Road is a film that I truly enjoyed watching. The entire film was well constructed from top to bottom. While touching on the pressing topic of our world as we know it turning into a desert where water is a high commodity, the film has a lot of heart without verbally saying much. The acting from Theron, Hardy, and Hoult was deep. This film is very visual. From the cinematography, color grading, production design, special effects, and costuming, the film creates this amazing world filled with gold, red, and bright turquoise. It is an interesting combination of skull laden violence from the vehicles and warriors paired with the vast ethereal landscapes and white-clothed females. The combination works as these elements often go hand in hand. I enjoyed the cinematography in the film because it was very dynamic, and the edit worked great with the shots and furthering the story. Although there was minimal dialogue in the film, the soundscape and accompanying score took me into the world of the film. I enjoyed seeing the rock elements incorporated throughout the film.",
139,26 July 2015,snafux7,1, Another hopelessly flawed reboot from Hollywood,"Do yourself a huge favor, go watch the first 10-15 mins of The Road Warrior (after the narrator part) and think about what makes it so compelling. I'll give you a big hint, it's because they used to actually practice the craft of storytelling in movies instead of just special effects. After just 15 mins of The Road Warrior you know all you need to know to be completely hooked into the story. More importantly we meet Max and through just a few scenes we get to KNOW Max, both as the requisite underdog bad-ass character but also as a man with compassion in his heart (witness the bond with his dog or the music box that he gives to the little kid). When we KNOW characters in this way, we CARE about them, we identify with them, we root for them, we love them and become completely immersed in their world. That's what makes a good movie, no amount of special effects, explosions or hot chicks in skimpy outfits can supplant that simple fact. And that's the big problem with Fury Road. The characters are one-dimensional cardboard cutouts that we don't care about. After watching the first 20 mins of this steaming pile of crap I still didn't know who any of the main characters really were and I certainly didn't care if they lived or died. Yes it has gorgeous action sequences, cool weapons and explosions oh my! But it's completely bereft of anything that draws you in emotionally and that makes it a huge failure. Add to that a story arc that doesn't make a helluva lot of sense and a baffling disregard for the value of oil (they waste it with abandon even though it's scarcity is why they are fighting in the first place). Unfortunately blockbusters like this are increasingly becoming the norm from Hollywood, I fear we'll get to a point in the not so distant future where nobody even remembers what a good action movie is like.",

A reboot seemed like a good idea with no need for Mel Gibson to reprise his earlier eponymous role. But what seemed like a good idea, with George Miller directing turns out to be a bad idea.

What did not work: Once on the road the pursuit chase scene is way too long. A tiresome visual display of C G I. I miss the Gone in 60 second real car stunts! The bad guy characters are cartoonish.

162,12 September 2022,Horst_In_Translation,4, The Fast and the Furiosa,"Okay, here we have the newest installment from the Mad Max franchise, namely Fury Road from 2015, which means this film is now also seven years old and the reason I am reviewing this today is that on the occasion of a reduced ticket price weekend here in my city, they were showing it again on the big screen. Just one single screening, but I was really curious about it and picked it over stuff like Forrest Gump, The Dark Knight, Inception, Notting Hill, maybe others and I knew them already. Sadly, I was not amazed at all by the outcome, but I will get to that a little later. First of all, a few words on the basics here: The man massively in charge of this picture was of course writer and director George Miller. He also directed the three old Mad Max films between 1979 and 1985, so it was a special anniversary for him 30 years after the previous most recent Mad Max, fifteen in the old millennium, fifteen in the new millennium. It was also a special anniversary for Miller because he turned 70 in 2015. His two co-writers for this film also have interesting bodies of work. Maybe not as interesting as going from Mad Max to Happy Feet and back, but still. Brendan McCarthy has worked in the art department and animation since the 1980s, but really not prolific at all in the 21st century while Nick Lathouris was most of all an actor during his career, pretty much since the days when the first Mad Max came out, but barely acted in the new millennium and his contribution to ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" was his first writing credit ever. So definitely a daring choice for this project. The outcome could not have been a bigger success with critics and awards bodies and the film is also still comfortably part of the 250 highest-rated films on imdb, at this point at position 201. As for awards, well it won six Oscars. That says it all. This did not include key categories like screenplay, direction and Best Picture, but it was nominated for the latter two at least. Also interesting that it came short for cinematography and visual effects (especially the latter because the film was pretty much one action sequence as a whole), but it sure had a shot to win there as well. Instead, the film triumphed in both sound categories, both design categories plus makeup/hairstyling and editing. Huge success overall.",

The story may not be the most sophisticated one (but tbh none of the movies of the Mad Max franchise are) but it gives what it promises: A trip on the fury road.

Not only did it launch Mel Gibson into an A- list star, it's gritty, post-apocalyptic style set a precedent for action movies and had a major influence on many directors for the next two decades. Two sequels arrived in the years following and then nothing. The series ended.

Thirty years have passed since we last saw Mel Gibson donning the leather in 1985's Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, which was of course, the third in the franchise after Mad Max (1979), and Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981). Over the years, rumors have persisted that writer/director George Miller was going to add to the franchise and take full advantage of today's high-tech movie making techniques by securing the budget necessary for a true blockbuster. It may have taken 3 decades, but Mr. Miller's dream is realized with his $100 million version (compared to $300,000 budget on the first one) that will undoubtedly satisfy the Mad Max fans, while also reminding the industry what an action movie can be (Michael Bay's corneas may burst into flames watching this).",

I love action movies, so this is not coming from a ""The Notebook"" kind of guy, but seriously, there is nothing nothing good about this movie, it's borderline (if not full-on) ridiculous!

Yes, but in a very joke-like kind of way, they seriously can't expect to be taken seriously, or expect anyone to think that in whatever post-apocalyptic scenario the world turns to, that is ever going to happen, so it is obviously to be taken as a joke, pretty much like 50% of the whole movie! Ohhh and talking about 50% of the whole movie, yeah, where did that go? Cos I could swear that they played the movie half-way through, and then just rewinded it back to the beginning. What a stupid movie! They spend half to movie trying to get somewhere, and when they get there (only to be greeted by the bad ass granny's, again, not ridiculous at all) they come to the conclusion that they have to go back to where they came from, and you get to see THE EXACT same stuff you had just seen 30 minutes before. What a pathetic excuse for a movie, I mean, half a movie. There is not even an attempt of a storyline! ohh and all these pseudo intellectual movie reviewers will try and convince you that it is a master piece because there are no pauses in the action to spoon feed you the information or storyline... what storyline?! Save yourself $10 and here is for you the whole movie, Silent Max (Hardy)(definitely not MAD) appears on screen and tells us about his bad ass life in this post-apocalyptic world. I wonder how he survived this far, since he is captured 5 minutes into the movie and taken to this Badguys Headquarter Mountians where he is to be drained of his blood to feed some even weirder baddies (Hoult). Then, Furiosa (Theron) is supposed to go on this whatever fuel run for this outlaw Ruler, Immortal Joe and flees with his pet girlfriends, so ALL of the bad guys in the WHOLE WORLD, decide to chase them. They spend half the movie running from them, in this busted down truck always dragging with them this HUGE ASS semi-trailer that apparently is filled with breast milk (mothers milk?)! Seriously? They get stuck in mud and all sorts of disasters, but GOD forbid they would ever just, unhook the semi-trailer, for whatever reason that is. They finally get to where they are going, to be greeted by 80 year old Amazon fighters! LOL, that somehow have survived for soo long is this God Forsaken world. They tell Furiosa, that the GreenLands are gone, so they decided to go back to where they came from, since all the baddies were on the road chasing them, and there was no one left holding the fort. So they start making they're way back, through all the baddies again, on her way back to where they were in the beginning of the movie. In the return sector, you see the exact same movie that you have just seen for the first half.

Not too sure  why the main actors took these roles.  3. The never ending chase, man did this seem to go on forever in a  world of fuel shortage.  4. Was there actually a story, alright the Mad Max genre never had much  of a story but i looked and looked but couldn't find any existence.  5. The old peoples home bikers, oh come on...  6. The one thing that i thought might be OK was the action but it  actually added to the nonsense rather than drag it out of its  mediocrity.  7. OK one of the real things that i found bugged me, was the lack of  inspiration in the costumes. it really appeared as if they had used the  previous Mad max costumes. Also the hair styles was..  8. The Cinematography set in Namibia, yes it was not even set in  Australia. Well what can i say, one minute it is plodding along the  next all the scenes are speed-ed up, why would you do that. It makes it  look like a scene from Benny Hill.  9. There must be some serious money behind a film this bad to  get so many good reviews, and then receive so many Oscar nominations.  It just shows the whole film business is contaminated.  10. Wrap up, i really would grade this movie as a 1 to counter balance  the 8.2, and sometimes i might do it on principle, but it does deserve  a 2. I would highly recommend people to never ever see this movie, and  to certainly not waste any money on it.

Sounds kind of cool, except the film does a terrible job explaining a few things, like who the hell is he (His name's Immortan Joe but we only know that from a few times his name is spoken), why are some of his henchmen ghost white, what's with them needing blood, and why should we ultimately care whether our characters prevail against him or not?

That writer-director George Miller and his team concocted such ferocious set pieces is impressive enough, but being able to pull it off with extraordinarily daring stunt work – augmented by gritty CGI – is simply awe-inspiring.",

The original seemed a little weird and B grade at the time of it's release as it was visionary long before other apocalyptic movies of the genre. This movie seems to pay homage with similarities using a gas tanker and other similar vehicles, desert backdrop, and a music toy used by the feral boy in ""Road Warrior. Many differences though in back story and the group Max has allied with to escape from the dregs trying to kill them. Great writing, direction, casting, acting, F/X, locations, and music.",

That being said- I did not enjoy this movie the first or second times I watched it... and I will hopefully NEVER try to watch it again...
Furry Road is easily THE most overrated garbage sci-fi to EVER reach the big screen.
False Flag critics thought it was going to win BIG Oscars as a strike against the man for Feminism (or some garbage) but all it ended up winning were sound and FX awards, nothing important (well not the big awards!).
I was actually offended by the terrible story, stodgy acting and dodgy script.
It is EASILY one of the worst reboots/remakes/sequels of ALL time, which is a scathing review in an era where more than 70% of films that open in cinemas (circa 2010-2020) fall into this category.
I have loved Theron in the past, but her hyper feminism is starting to turn my stomach, Hardy/Max is the title character (sort of...) and had no lines, and when you could make them out, they were corny as hell in really weird inconsistent accents???
I wouldn't force my worst enemy to watch this movie and certainly wouldn't chastise ANYONE who wanted to turn it off in the first 15 minutes.
Everything in the movie except the consistent color pallet crumbles under even the slightest scrutiny.

He meets Theron, and it's obvious they are both running from the same common enemy - yet both continue to think they are adversaries.

213,10 January 2016,movienerd21,1, wishing there was a negative (-) voting in IMDb just for this epic waste of time and money!,"First of all, I'd like to clear a few things out. 1. I have never written another review on IMDb. The fact that this movie urged me to do so, speaks volumes. 2. I have not watched the original Mad Max with Mel Gibson. Therefore, I cannot condemn the whole series, I will only be judging this movie. 3. I L-O-V-E adventure/fantasy/dystopian movies!!! I'm literally a junkie, I have watched pretty much every one out there. So I am not a hater of the genre. That being said, I will continue with my first, genuine reaction to this film in quotes: "" What the f..* did I just watch. These are 120 minutes of my life that I will NEVER, EVER GET BACK!!! Thank the lord I didn't go to the movies to watch it with my friends when they asked me to, 'cause apart from my time, I'd also be crying over my money now!"" Yes, in my non- professional opinion as a humble viewer, this piece of sh..* that I wasted my time watching was absolutely horrific. What do I even start with? The absolutely ridiculous , non-existent plot?A stupid bunch consisting of a lunatic, a bald chief on the verge of schizophrenia and a few hot girls, just because, decide to run off to the sunset to find a non-existent promise land and are chased by another crazy bunch of ugly beasts and brainwashed slaves for absolutely no freaking reason. Oh, and as if that was not stupid enough, half way the decide they were wrong and turn the F..* AROUND!!! So they continue being chased by the same idiots who end up not catching them after all and then they release....water...and they all live happily ever after!!! Hooray!!!! WTF????!!! If there was some interest in the history and setting of this dystopian world it eluded me , since no one freaking bothered to explore it a little further. All we get is that these people are pretty much dying of thirst due to a lack of water, but every time their ugly leader wakes up in a good mood he releases a freaking waterfall and wastes half their water supplies by spilling it all over the place. Not to mention this literally MAD Max character, who decides to pretty much have himself killed in a ruthless road trip- gone-bad even though he doesn't really give a sh..*! Why on earth (other than the obvious reason of earning some shamefull but necessary money)would wonderful actors like Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy (whom I don't particularly love, but in all honesty I haven't exactly followed so far in his career) agree to be part of this sh..* excuse of a film, I have no idea. All I can say, is that it took me three days to watch the damn thing, because I was so freaking bored that I 'd literally stop it every 15 minutes or so to go find something interesting to do with my life. But I am a compulsive nerd who just had to finish what she started, so I went through 120 ENDLESS MINUTES OF TORTURE AND BOREDOM, only to come out of it with so much anger that I had to come in here and write a review to release part of it and go to bed. So,DO NOT WATCH MAD MAX. DO NOT WATCH IT. Watch 50 shades of gray instead. It's a sh..* movie as well, but if you happen to be a 50 year old pervert with 0 love life you might actually enjoy it more. Or better yet, go find something else to do with your life. Anything really. Reading the back label of your clothes detergent would be more educational, useful, interesting AND entertaining.

214,16 July 2015,darkblue-5,3," No script, no movie...","First of all I must say that I've had the pleasure to see the first 3 ""Mad Max"" movies. I know that this ""Mad Max - Fury Road"" was not meant to be neither a prequel nor a sequel of the original ones, so I write this review with that in mind. Summarizing my opinion, this movie was dreadful. So bad, that I couldn't believe it was the same movie that got me so psyched when I saw the trailer last year. It's a non stop of crazy cars, explosions and cgi supported stunts that will definitely please those that like cars and action movies, but whose plot makes no sense at all. Now I could be here telling you about the visions that Max has from beginning until the end, which lacks explaining, or about the fact that they begin a journey from A to B just to find out they must return to A, but if they had stayed there all along the movie would be 7 minutes long, or even to the fact that they meet a bunch of women that live in the middle of nowhere, but surprisingly one of them was waiting barenaked on top of an electric pole, waiting for whoever would ever turn there, if it took 5 minutes or 200 years!... Instead I'll only complaint that apart from the fast driving and explosion filled footage, this has no story at all. The quest begins with a purpose, but that purpose is faulty and Max's character is relutant to join any group but quickly changes his mind... he's rogue, but he's nice... Furiosa is a powerful woman but is eager to accept that man she knows nothing of, to join their getaway posse... It's all so senseless that almost made me cry! Build some hot rods, add some blasts, create some funky looking characters and forget any story, because we have a movie! Oh, and could someone tell me what the f... are some guys doing playing drums and a guitar that shoots fire in the middle of a high speed pursuit? I mean, I know it's badass, but come on.....",
215,7 July 2015,madmax3,1," If you're a fan of the original trilogy, this movie is not for you.","to be honest, i grew up on the original trilogy, and i love it to this day. when i heard that a new mad max is in the making i was really ecstatic about it. but when i heard that Mel Gibson won't be max, well, after waiting for so many years for a forth movie, i was extremely disappointed to say the least. and it got even worst when i heard that the lead went to a limited ""actor"" ( i am using the word ""actor"" in the most loose way i can here) who lack charisma, and ability to lead a movie like hardy, especially when you consider the budget of this film, they could have gotten a real star to play the part (russell crowe? hugh jackman anyone??).The rest of the cast didn't add any optimism (Charlize ""I'll make you movie as long as your check clears"" Theron, Zoë ""My mom and dad fixed my career"" Kravitz, the list goes on),i was really not looking for this movie to come out. yet i decided to watch it with a non biased opinion. so, this movie didn't really need a ""first degree"" actors, mainly because the acting, characters, and story line comes second to the visual effects. If Gibson was here, it wouldn't make a difference. so if you like the 3D movies, this one is for you, however, if you expected to see a continuation to thunderdome, well bad luck buddy. this movie was made as a re-boot to attract new audience, and not for the old ones. in road warrior and thunderdome, you got a pattern: the movie starts, give you a good build up, that leads to the chase at the end. it seems that in this one miller told himself:"" wait a sec! why wait the entire movie for a chase? lets just start the movie with a chase, and forget the rest!"". and thats how it goes, 5 minutes into the movie, the chase starts, and only ends 2 minutes before the credits. if you've watched road warrior and thunderdome enough times, you would see a lot, and i mean a lot of scenes from these two movies that looked like they were copied and paste over and over again (such as the famous truck crash to the vehicle in front, and so on). the story is also a big mash, mainly from thunderdome (instead of tomorrow morrow land, here they are going to that green place). and as for max? well he doesn't say much. he is supposed to be insane (thats what they tell us at least) but mainly he acts like a person that suffers from some degree of retardedness. even in the fighting scene he doesn't do much. mainly runs, but nothing more. the real stars of this movie are the vehicles and the effects. so if you are a fan of the transformers movies, this one would be right up your ally. however if you are a fan of the original trilogy, you wont get much from this movie. It adds nothing to the original trilogy story. Its just an average action movie for our time with little to no story, and lots of shiny lights. the fact that even if they would have change the entire cast, it wouldn't have made any different, pretty much explains itself. but oh well, for us true fans, we'll always have mad max 1 to 3.",

After seeing it snag 6 Technical Oscars (costume and production design, make-up, editing, sound, sound mixing), I figured, ""Wow, this must be really good."" It did beat out Star Wars: The Force Awakens in a couple of those categories after all. So of course my first step was to IMDb it and see what the general consensus was, and I was never more... confused. The first thing I saw was a 90 Metacritic score, and the second was a B-line of 1 star ratings coupled with brutal reviews from users. Hmm... Alright. Now I never saw the original Mad Max films (shame on me, I know). Going into this movie completely blind, I just didn't get it. Yeah, lots of action right from the get go, but it took forever to even know what was going on. Post-apocalyptic world. Guy gets visions of a haunted past, gets kidnapped, OK, old guy villain with a messed up face, thousands of followers, obsessed with breeding, tyrannical, got it. That's the first 5 minutes, then characters in cars (more like dune buggies and a tank) leave, go rogue, get chased by the bad guys just mentioned, meet up with the main character through a series of events and dozens of people commence to die in the next hour and 45 minutes of the film during what seems to be just an endless car chase that winds up ending in the exact same place it started. Wait, I get it, the people that like this movie also like NASCAR. That had to be it since I fell asleep about the same amount of times during this movie as I do during a NASCAR race on the rare occasion it's actually on my TV. However, anything being discussed during all of this action between characters was just meaningless as by this point after a good amount of intense car-chasing action and explosions were just thrown in my face, I just didn't care about any of these characters. Was the action pretty sweet to watch? Actually, yes. Everything looked cool, but that's not enough. I'd say 2 maybe 3 of those 6 Oscars were actually deserved. 4/10 for good action and looking cool, ""meh"" acting, but not much else earning points.

217,20 May 2022,madahab,10, Initial reservations resolved,"When I heard a fourth Mad Max film was being made I was sceptical about Mel Gibson being replaced with Tom Hardy made me less enthusiastic about the film. Despite the former's fall from grace over the last decade he was still an iconic figure in the series. When the film played at the theatre where I worked I didn't give it much more than a passing glance and thought that it was obnoxiously loud. It would be over two years later when I caught a clip of the black and chrome version and was stunned by how beautiful it looked. I gave it a try. Despite my initial hesitancy to accept Hardy as Max those concerns quickly faded; he's fine in the role. But it was Charlize Theron as Furiosa that won me over. She says very little but the emotions play so vividly on her face and eyes. We are given very little about her origins,especially how she lost her arm but it's not necessary. Some who are going to be disappointed that Max is not much more than a secondary character in the film, which leads me to the question: Have you not seen the last two films. Max is only part of a larger story, much like The Man With No Name from the Sergio Leone Italian spaghetti films. There are scenes that are truly remarkable,especially one in which we see people on long stilts crossing a swamp. In the black and chrome version it resembles an illustration from any prog rock album cover of the 70's. I'm still unsure if this has surpassed The Road Warrior as my favourite action film.",

Everyone who had seen it before I did told me that I wouldn't have to see the previous films to 'get' it. But as soon as the revs of V8 engines start roaring when the film starts and Max immediately is thrust into a world of poop, I feel that the movie assumes you know who Max is and are familiar with his mythology. So if you haven't seen the original trilogy and want to watch Fury Road, I suggest you catch up first. If not for the sake of familiarising yourself with the Mad world of Max, then watch them simply for the fact that they are undeniably awesome. Wellthe first two, at least.",

The audience doesn't get much deeper in her story, just as well the story of Max. You just have to guess. The movie is also very brutal and at some points (in Game of Thrones-style) really disgusting. The women they want to save are really annoying characters and you just cant feel with them.

In ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" Miller has pushed his Gilliam-esque vision of a world gone distraught to its sensible extraordinary. Never again are the general population of Max Rockatansky's reality just scroungers for oil or power; they have been changed into animals of condition, either left with one characterising need or left with no similarity of reason. ""Fury Road"" is a fierce film, yet the rough demonstrations in this world don't feel like subjective activity beats—they rise up out of an entire absence of different alternatives or a firm feeling of straight-up madness. Mill operator's new vision of Max isn't a warrior. Or maybe, he's a man driven by the recollections of past sins to do minimal more than survive. He strolls with the phantoms of those he couldn't spare, and his voyaging allies have pushed him to the edge of rational soundness. ",

A guy in red with a flame-spouting guitar. But this movie's triumph is that these action sequences are not tiring, quite the opposite. This is due to the development and construction of characters like Nux(Nicholas Hoult, who has one of the best emotional arcs of the movie) and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who, whether you like it or not, is the protagonist of the movie, and it adds to the emotional and dramatic weight of the scenes.",

It is just people driving through the desert with unexplained things happening in it.

Despite the shocking violence we still routed for him and we understood his personal pain, the evolution to MADMAX unfolded and we could relate to how a good man could go down this path.
So what happened here!! We have a character that is mute and apart from being Tom Hardy has little else going for him.

Tom Hardy takes on Mel Gibson's mantle as Max fantastically, showing the will to survive despite the impossible odds. Nicholas Hoult and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley also give considerable depth to the movie, proving it not to be a mindless barrage of explosions.

For me, car chases are the low point of any action movie and half of the time, I am tempted fast-forward to the ""good parts"". Sounds like I'd be in for a most disappointing movie experience with this movie, since Fury Road is more or less a two hour car chase. Boy was I wrong. I can't recall when was the last time I was so enthralled with the relentless on-screen action. What I especially like about the movie, is that while battle fatigue is always a concern with heavier action movies and could easily set in even within a few minutes in lesser movies, but not this time, as George Miller manages to keep things constantly fresh, interesting and exciting throughout this relentless two hour chase. Not only that, but he also manages to rev up the engine ever so slightly throughout the movie, that even though the action already starts on high speed, it just keeps gathering more speed right until the very end. As for the the car chase, apparently most other action movies just don't know how to do a proper car chase but finally someone has done it right. While other movies have iconic action scenes, this movie is just one colossal action scene from start to finish.

'Fury Road' is equally well made but is too much of a good thing - a lengthy, hyperkinetic, physics-defying car-chase that is punctuated by some staggeringly good stunt work (although CGI is used to maintain the illusion that there were no safety lines, nets etc) that all begins to look the same after a while. The design work that went into the various apocalyptic vehicles is imaginative and fun, but the grotesqueries of the characters is a bit 'over the top' and the lack of 'narrative background' (the 'culture' of the citadel seems to exist only to set up weird or cool scenes) makes for generally undeveloped characters who exist only to chase or be chased. Great to see Hugh Keays-Byrne ('The Toecutter' in the original Mad Max (1979)) back and burning rubber on bleak wasteland roads once more.",
282,16 May 2015,sgourley-844-300070,10, A true film wrapped in a Hollywood blockbuster,"I guarantee that this is a film that will stand the test of time to become a classic. Character development and plot lines are quickly developed by putting the characters in one bizarre predicament after another. The themes of environmentalism, political theory, and philosophy lurk just beneath the surface, but they are never actually discussed. It is a tribute to the skill and talent of everyone involved in this film that they can say so much while saying so little. It is affirming to know that you can still go to the movies and have your expectations not only exceeded, but absolutely blown away! The film-goer needs an open mind and a willingness to mentally go to this other world. This is a world that is a horrifying depiction of a path the world may have chosen for itself. Mad Max offers both a vision of hell, but also of the divine. The divine comes in the form of a rag tag group of strangers that accept each other, quickly care about one another, and then gain strength and confidence in following a shared vision; a hope for a better world. The depiction of the power of hope is moving and one leaves this film with a positive belief in humanity. One of the best movies to come along in a long long time.",

A couple of anticipated comic book movies as usual, a few remakes and reboots of course and finally the next instalment of the ""Mad Max"" franchise after 30 years of absence. We've all been anticipating it for too long, as a fourth in the series was to be released 8 years ago with Mel Gibson returning as the titular character. Unfortunately 9/11 happened and the Australian dollar collapsed, the Iraq War caused problems via travelling to Namibia and Gibson lost interest. After series creator George Miller finished the ""Happy Feet"" series, he finally returned to the project with five storyboard artists producing 3,500 art panels, a $150 million budget and then co-writing a script with 2000AD comic writer Brenan McCarthy, and Australian actor Nico Lathouris.

The film put forth here is one of intensity and nearly nonstop action, a film that does not have its characters stopping in a random place so that we can see some back story that really is not relevant to the plot, no flashback scenes so the director can tell you why the characters are the way they are...no, here we have simple action and the characters' actions telling you what they are about. It would be nice to see other Mad Max films in the future and it is possible as Tom Hardy did sign on to do three films.

It's less an adrenaline rush than a direct I.V.-shot of caffeine into your bloodstream. Faster and more furious than the most recent car-based movie, it's kinetic action in the style of a fever dream. A punk-rock, post-apocalyptic nightmare that's a feast for the senses, benefiting from director Miller's visionary and fearless eye. Pure, unadulterated insanity that reminds us what it looks like when great artists try something uniquely extraordinary and succeed. Miller's main achievement is getting everyone to buy into this insanity. With the scale of a blockbuster and the soul of an indie, MM:FR is unlike anything you'll see in theatres this year. Hardy as the new Max continues the characters reactive-style heroics with just enough heart behind his crazy eyes, and all the supporting cast portray their varying levels of madness with crazed conviction. However, all of these talented performances are overshadowed by the amazing aesthetic. Through grimy, herky-jerky visuals, Miller gives us practical-effects-filled action sequences that are masterpiece level. This isn't to say there isn't something deeper going on. On top of being of a feminist manifesto, a study of religious extremism, and an argument that capitalism leads to death, it's ultimately a moving story of equality and hope that proves goodness can defeat desperation. Haven't seen the Mel Gibson originals? That's okay. Don't let the daunting task of seeing all those first keep you from one of the greatest action films in years.",

I was so bored, but because so many critics and web sites seem to rate it so highly, I stuck with it. I'll admit I fell asleep for part of it. There is no suspense whatsoever and the character Mad Max is lame. I just watched the first Mad Max with Mel Gibson and although it was a little choppy, it had heart and it was way more suspenseful and exciting than this one, especially considering how long ago it was made. I enjoyed that one. This one cannot compare. I plan on watching the second Mad Max movie with Mel which is rated even higher than the first one. I think the problem is that the person who wrote the screen plays for the first two Mad Max movies so many years ago, used stories written by other people and just translated the stories into screen plays. I believe he wrote the original story for this one and it stinks! Perhaps he's past his prime. I really don't understand the hype unless it's because of the stars or sentiment for the director/screen writer. In my opinion, Charlize took a big step down in her career with this. I love action and thrillers and post-apocalyptic movies that are well done. This is not.

If they were to promote a film with a ""female/feminist"" led tone it should have been Inside Out. All the major characters in that film were female had depth and you cared about them. That is not the case in this film. And all the critics that gave this film such rave reviews did a major disservice to their readers. Batman vs Superman was decent compared to this and that movie sub-par at best. So much of this film does not make sense. From the rolling rock concert in the middle of a life and death battle to the motivation of the characters once their initial plan goes.

350,12 December 2019,andrewroy-04316,8," An epic visual marvel of an action movie, with enough ideas to keep you satisfied and engaged","The opening to Mad Max may well be the most attention-grabbing I've seen, gluing me to the edge of my seat eager to see how the movie unfolds. The energy and visuals continue to amaze throughout, though the early world-building was the best storytelling in the film. The vision of the desolate post-apocalyptic world was so well realized, I was a bit disappointed when I realized the movie was pretty much exclusively going to be a big long car chase. The opening 20 minutes or so, when we see Max chased and caught, meet the ruler and get a sense of how the world works, and meet Furiosa and get a sense of her plan, are near perfect filmmaking and great set up for the characters and world. We do learn more about the girls and crucially more about the people working for the ruler through Nux, a stowaway turned traitor, but the movie is light on character development, dialogue, and plot. That's not all bad - Miller is committed to making a thrilling visual action movie, and he undeniably nails that. The action is so well shot it makes similar action sequences feel fresh and exciting. There is some relevance to contemplate as we see Furiosa certain that there is a green place where she grew up, only to realize it was an illusion in her mind and that her only real hope is realizing the potential of where she has been living and taking control there. I admire Miller's commitment to making a great action movie and not forcing a bunch of dialogue or romance in, but while I marvel at the craft and visuals of the action, especially early, the other elements are good but not great, and even the greatest action scenes repeated for 2 hours can't maintain that same level of awe.",

It has no reason to exist, other than to make money. It is not an homage to the 80s in any real sense, it exploits that era's cinematic ingenuity, bastardizes it and throws in all kinds of nonsense that plague our nihilistic age. The new film is a film about nothing, it is sterile and empty of meaning. It is a p.c. nightmare in which lone women drive cars in deserts and beat men up to survive. It's kind of ironic that a film about anarchy, rebellion, and brute struggle for survival actually caters to the sensibilities of a weak, entitled, spoiled, deluded, politically correct generation that conforms completely and indulges in fantasies about human nature that have no basis in reality and that would be shattered in an instant in the kind of universe Mad Max depicts.",

They did everything right. This is not a ""reboot"" (I HATE that expression) or a remake. It can fit in the previous Mad Max incantations, stand on its own or be open to interpretation (a fan rumour suggests Max in this film is not even the same Max as Mel Gibson's.) They didn't hire a new director or writer etc etc...instead the studio heads let the master himself come back 35 years later and redefine his vision. There are easter eggs throughout the film that connect this movie to The Road Warrior, the Mad Max world and sets itself apart. The bleak wasteland is so intricately created that half of the time your jaw is dropping at the sheer insanity in front of you. Does it make sense? Does it need to? What has happened to these people to make them completely insane? It is science fiction-post apocalyptic-action madness.

I love action movies... but this movie had maybe 3 minutes of hand to hand combat (this scene wasn't even very good), and the rest was a car chase. ONE LONG CAR CHASE. at least Furious 7 had nice looking cars! these cars were dirty and ugly, which pretty much describes the every character and costume in the movie. The scenery wasn't pretty either... just wasteland. If I'm going to watch something with no plot it needs to be pretty mind blowing otherwise. The action in it wasn't even intense.. just lots of vehicles blowing up. Like throwing exploding spears into adjacent vehicles. I was bored of exploding vehicles 15min into the action. No real INTENSE moments (remember Furious 7 when Paul Walker was hanging out of the back of a truck that was hanging off a cliff and he had to run up and jump onto Letti's car?THAT WAS INTENSE!)the main character Max had maybe 50 words for the whole movie. there were also a lot of ""eew gross"" moments which were pretty unnecessary.. (like the mothers milk... what the heck was that all about). Hubby didn't like the movie either and this is a guy who thinks Mortal Kombat, Heavy Metal and the Rocky Horror Picture Show are the best movies ever made. I usually go by IMDb user ratings when i go watch a show and this is the first time I've disagreed with the rest of the users. for a movie to get over 8/10 it has to be captivating to virtually all viewers (eg Lord of the Rings Trilogy).

The entirety of the film has an orange tint that amplifies the desolate apocalyptic feeling of the landscape. Barren, hopeless, and endless, the Mars-like texture truly sends the viewer to another world as chaos begins. Much credit must go to the set producers, hair & make-up artists and costume designers for their extraordinary work. The use of sound also had a huge impact and seriously added to the impact of the action sequences of which there are many. Something else that had a huge impact was the incredible score. The action on screen was full throttle and the score matched it perfectly. The energy of the music really enhanced the tension of the chase. Performance-wise; Charlie Theron was great, she is physically and emotionally capable, and absolutely kicks ass. Tom Hardy was pretty good, but he was really just there and felt like a support for Furiosa's character. If any supporting character deserves the most praise it would be Hoult.

Impossible stunts - poor graphics ineffectual characters and the worst thing is that I really wanted to like it. It made a bunch of money though and whilst crap makes money, crap's all we'll get. Why is a reboot or a sequel, made decades after the original, with a massively higher budget and more tech, generally worse than the original? Maybe because in lieu of the issues above, they had to cast well, write well and develop characters we cared about. Give this a miss - most video games will satisfy your need for action and will have more character.",

I don't only watch Oscar nominated big budget Hollywood movies, I also watch a lot of B movies and low budget films and generally enjoy them all - provided the film makers are making an effort.

MasterPieceOfShit is all i can say. Terminator 5 may have flaws but at least it was entertaining and had its great star back Mr Arnold Schwarzenegger. That film was smashed for been bad and Mad Max gets the reviews like its epic, its not at all it's simply nothing like the masterpiece they lead you to believe.

391,17 June 2015,mrmatthewhoffman,1, Reasons to Never See this Movie (from a Mad Max fan),"Reasons to never see this movie: 1) There were so many explosions that, had I walked out of the theater and into a car bombing, I probably would not have noticed. 2) Max was a bumbling idiot that did almost nothing useful or productive in the entire movie. One or two small things, yes, but he spends the entire first 1/4 of the movie as a total spectator, which brings me to... 3) This movie could have been made without ever including Max. It had nothing to do with Max, as mentioned above he did nothing really useful, and he was almost the flattest and most emotionless character in the story. 4) It has little to do with reality or, frankly, physics. At one point there is a dust/thunder/tornado/lightning/darkness storm that has no apparent cause except to make the interminable chase seen different for a couple of minutes. 5) The villain? An overweight dude with no physical presence, dressed in clear plastic armour, and with a serious breathing issue. It's like if Darth Vader had lived to 150 and brutally interrogated a million donuts. He has no personality, and, basically, no lines worth noting. If he had been silent the entire time, it would have been better. 6) It makes no reference to the previous three movies. At all. Was this a reboot? Why even include Max then, since Max didn't have any actual impact? Oh, right. The ""franchise"". So George Miller made this movie trying to draw on his fan base for success? I don't know, but this is the truth... 7) I am a fan of the first three Mad Max movies. But my support of this franchise ends there. Like Aliens 3 and Terminator 3, there is nothing worth seeing here, unless you want two hours of explosion and nothing, nothing else.",

Watch it on your own risk and expect nothing, so you will be not disappointed. I hope they respect the MAD MAX legacy in the future so we will not be forced to watch our movie profanation. I was not happy hearing that Tom Hardy was playing Max's role, but he didn't. He just shoot a pair of bullets and said a pair of words.

This coming from a fan of the previous Mad Max movies. I don't see how this is getting 8.7 other than it would make sense for the production to pay people to give it a high review.

One of the best action movies out there,"George Miller's masterpiece Mad Max:Fury Road will definitely create tension and will leave on on the theater sweating and with no words as how epic this film was. Is shaping up to be as much a unique experience for longtime Max fans as it will be for those who've never before visited Miller's vision of a sun-scorched hellish post- apocalyptic world, populated largely by violent maniacs. So don't worry if you haven't seen the older movies, there is absolutely no need to. 120 minutes of vehicular carnage and craziness, this movie has all aspects it needed to be.""Fury Road"" is a beautifully realized vision of the post-apocalyptic future, filmed in Namibia but looking like it was another world. And almost no CGI was used, it felt like it was real as of how amazing cinematography was, this is why it will leave many other movies behind. Tom hardy as Max gives a wonderful performance as replacing Mel Gibson, the main character of the older mad Max movies. Also the other heroine Charlize Theron plays Furiosa really good as well. Having to cut her hair and giving her best indicates she is really into the roll of Furiosa, feminine form outside, but masculine form inside. In addition, the movie also had a good but simple plot, but it definitely didn't need a deep plot. Having not much dialog also helps other people from different countries to enjoy it, as they may not have subtitles. The music was phenomenal, only one time watching the movie is enough to enjoy and get it into your head, even some of the action is synchronized with the music. So i greatly recommend you to go and join this crazy ride, specially in 3D as Miller uses chucking arrows, bones, and parts of cars and bodies at you. 'What a lovely day' indeed.",

Setting in future, the plot's apocalyptic society and sexual politics are pretty straightforward; combining the insanity, hyper- accelerating and exhilarating actions without repetition of styles, all are presented in a creative way which is rarely seen in recent films. While it's not necessary anyway, the film does not have much of characters development but both Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, as well as the presence of Nicholas Hoult have a great screen time of heroic performances. Meanwhile, musics by Junkie XL sound loud, tremendous and powerful (likely influenced by Hans Zimmer's style) surprisingly suit the film well, including the cool and classic cinematography by John Seale, Miller is able to deliver more than what audiences might be expecting, even with overdose f action scenes, it is still effectively balanced with emotional moments and inspiring messages.",

This movie is devoid of a sane story but in fact according to me it neither have a story nor a plot and regretfully i have to say that this is the worst movie i have seen in recent history. Mad max fury road is highly overrated and is mocking other movies which have ratings between 8 and 8.7. Albeit, I am a huge fan of Tom Hardy and Chalize Therone but their acting could not save it from becoming a complete ruin. i am giving it a one point and seriously if there had been an option to rate a movie below one point then i would have given it much lower points. Its also a suggestion to IMDb developers that they should ameliorate the movie rating algorithm and incorporate an option that can rate movies below the current lowest mark so that people should rate according to their aspirations.

It never felt like they left the world of Mad Max. The action and visuals were fantastic. My only mixed part of it was ""Max"" played by Tom Hardy and ""Imperator Furiosa"" played by Charlize Theron. They were good stand ins but I never was as invested in them as much as I was for Mel Gibson. As much as I hate to say it, I think it's due to the fact that Mel did have Mad Max 1 to flesh out his story and character (even though I am not a fan of that film). It made him stand out as an actual human. But I don't wanna sound down on it cause I definitely think it's great. It is right under the Road Warrior for me. This is a great film to just turn on if you want just high thrill action. I really do think the Prequel they have in the works for this film will only make it better!",

Is it the most thought provoking film ever? No. Does it have an amazingly original story line with super complex and deep characters? No. When you get down to it, it's a 2 hour chase scene. But that doesn't matter with this movie. It wanted to be fun and it achieved that. What sets this apart from other movies that try to be nothing more than ""fun is the fact that it doesn't waste time on a story that doesn't matter anyway. Lets use the Transformers franchise as an example. Overall, pretty terrible franchise. Why? Well a lot of reasons, but the one I care about here is that each movie wastes time on pointless crap that doesn't matter. It's a Transformers movie, I want to see Transformers fight. I don't want to watch humans argue in a Transformers movie. Those movies can't be fun if they keep wasting time on stupid stuff. Mad Max doesn't do that. It lays out the basics, so it makes some amount of sense, then they get straight to the action and it doesn't really stop.

During this film I didn't react to it maybe not quite as well as I expected, but after it all, I was pretty well convinced and had that slight feeling of so much going on that you'd want to see it over again to catch more of it. I usually felt that going from one camera shot to the next was a bit overbearing, but most of the good parts during the road raging scenes were captured well and people getting the basic gist of it. In reality, I wouldn't consider it the best action movie ever made, but probably not THE best action ""movie"" ever made. It was still much well done and quite enjoyable enough though.",

Charlize Theron kicks ass but only too seldom, the make up doesn't hide her beauty in this case as it had happened in Monster . Wouldn't it have been more interesting to see her fight vs those goons?. As for the goons, their make-up reminded me of the mutant species of vampires in Blade 2 Tom Hardy? What can we say about him? Several reviewers wrote he was a promising young actor. Is it still so after his lame performance ? This movie doesn't deserve any star. A star is too much, I hope no one will think of doing Mad Max Fury Road 2 i think it'd be a further waste of time and money.

Tom Hardy is on the fast track to becoming the big budget acting star Hollywood has longed looked for because HE CAN ACTUALLY ACT! Speaking of which Charlize Theron delivers an amazing performance that should get her several award nods. Do yourself a favor and go see this on the big screen!

And this is supposed to be a better movie? It happened with Alien. The original movie thrived on the idea of one relentlessly hostile indestructible enemy and superb dramatic acting.. Sequels had them being blown up like paper mache Godzillas. What made the original Road Warrior so effective was how stark and raw everything was, so primitive. In Fury Road they seem to have developed elaborate technology for building elaborate domains. I thought they were in a battle of survival for the last drop of gasoline.

Fortunately, its still better then the movies they've been putting out. At least its watchable! Lets start with the good: Its colorful, action packed, loud, full of explosions. The costuming and makeup is FABULOUS. It lets itself be quirky, which gives it that 80's movie twinkle that looks good on gritty action flicks. It could have been a movie without the shameless mad max branding. Now time for the bad: First off, the plot is weak and a serious rip off of the movie Phoenix the Warrior (1988) and then the scenes of the city are obviously ripping off Metropolis (1927)...Seriously guys? -Max and the 'wives' are weak...Poor character development and motivation. Unrecognizable as a Mad max, hes so unnecessary for the plot that one of the bad guys seems to be the good guy instead. The wives are offensively stereotyped, unrelateable, and poorly cast. The only good acting in the whole movie is from the older women. -There is no gore/splatter and surprisingly little blood or violence for an action flick, it all happens off screen. People survive car crashes that throw them from the vehicle etc without a scratch. At the same time things are stylized, giving the movie a childish, animated feel like they were seeking a PG13 rating. -Finally, technical stuff. The lighting on the CG is poor at best. The CG is weak when the movie is not in 3D (and its full of cringe worthy moments designed for 3D that don't hold up without). The audio of the voices and guns are too low compared to the music and sound effects. Its causes a lot of 'whats happening' moments, because you cant tell what someone said, or that someone shot a gun etc. It doesn't help that everyone is talking in awful put on WWE wrestling voices, calling each other 'brother' like hulk hogan and their accents keep changing. The dialog is TERRIBLE even for an action flick. You cant even understand what all the main characters names are they are so poorly presented.",

I don't even know who the stand-in is, but he has no personality. Charlize Theron is physically imposing but doesn't get to do a lot of acting. The supporting actresses are just eye candy for hetero men, their flimsy desert wraps artfully placed to just barely cover the naughty bits.

Don't get me wrong - if you don't like insatiable action - car chases and madness - they you will hate this film (My Girlfriend who has never seen a Max film didn't really think it was great). So be warned- if this is not your type of film - then the Fury Road experience will be hours of annoying sound and car crashes. For the fans of this genre - it reaches amazing new heights - with finally a director understanding that CGI is a tool that ""adds"" to the grandeur - does not replace it. Performances are solid from the entire case - and set production and makeup are just - well - Mad. If you are debating 3D or not-- I saw it in 3D and would say it adds very little -- I think IMAX would be the best experience as it is so ""vast"" as a film. If you don't have IMAX - then I would skip 3D and go to a good HD cinema with the best sound system. In a long list of franchise add ons - Miller deserves credit for bringing something even better than the original. Enjoy.",

I liked the action, the costumes, the pathos, the humour, the violence, the whole unstoppable caravan of carnage. Girls and even old ladies in prominent roles was a nice touch and if this sidelined Tom Hardy so be it. Charlize Theron was surprisingly good and the young ladies effective enough.

Does the original trilogy really have that mainstream fondness? Cult favourites certainly. I've only seen the tedious first half hour of the first which I will finish at some point. I trust Road Warrior is a significant improvement. But since Beyond Thunderdrome, George Miller directed family movies such as the Babe sequel and the Happy Feet pair. He has an Oscar for directing a cute film about dancing penguins. But was the sunstroked chaos of Fury Road swirling in his head the whole time? Nevertheless, despite its long production period, Fury Road is not a film that feels overthought. Waiting out a couple decades of mindless CGI disaster porn, Fury Road is a breath of fresh dusty air with ambitious practical effects taken to a scale not possible in the 1980s. It's commendable for that alone, given it's essentially one long chase scene with little time to breathe. It's an incredible technical feat with its editing and creativity to keep it thrilling.",

As with Mad Max 2, Fury Road begins with a voice-over narration setting the scene. In Mad Max 2, that voice was some nameless man, acting as a teller of the myth of Max. In Fury Road, it is the voice of Max himself. Mad Max 2 struck me as more mythic, but Fury Road does not eschew this approach but it does appropriates other stylistic genres. ",

Since last week my brother (older than me) has been nagging about how much he would like to see the film. The trailer itself as a video ad did not get any attention and got skipped as soon as possible, I knew it was not worth it yet we eventually went to see it as we did not have anything else to do. From playing around with umbilical cords of a dead woman and (a now dead) baby, to the creepy deformed talking pile of flesh that I think was supposed to resemble a child yet had a beard, this f**k-fest had it all. Using 150 million dollars to show what the world would be like without water seems rather excessive. Not only that, how about we add every single dumb idea that comes into mind and call it a film, including killing grannies, shooting bullets at the eyes of grannies, having a human as a ""blood bank"" connected to the driver of the car, and my personal favorite, driving over a pregnant woman, then slicing the woman open to check if the baby is ""all right"". Don't get me wrong, the scenery was wonderful, especially the canyons, but all of it is completely destroyed by the modernization of a film that had none of the ""brilliant"" ideas that were described earlier. The cast have also made a significant change in the good way as they played their role perfectly, but that was not enough to cover up the tornado of horrible, horrible ideas thrown into the film. In general, this film is a typical Hollywood production with a completely ruined sense of entertainment and if no one is going to say it, it will only get worse. By all means, if you want to throw your money into a puddle (hah, get it?) go see the film.

The other way round, I really felt a film after years! What the action movies are lack of these days is heart and soul and this movie got it right! Most of the new generation blockbusters have lots of action, digital effects, high technology, maybe magnificence but without emotion and spark. Hollow movies... This Mad Max movie is not a bluster movie. Somehow, there is a drama in the background. There are chases, but not for the sake of it. We care about the characters. As for Mad Max criticism as he was not the hero or star of the movie, it didn't frustrate me. While I was watching The Dark Knight Rises, I was always asking ""where is the Batman? where is the Batman? because Batman was like a cameo in the movie. Mad Max is different. Max is there, waiting for you! I mean it works here somehow. Everything works well in the movie. The story is (if there is one) is plain and simple, but somehow it works perfectly. Story development is not powerful, but the movie doesn't need that. Maybe, only flaw of the movie is the underestimated villains. The master director George Miller doesn't do justice to the great villains of the film. A great villain is another thing that new generation action movies are lack of. We rarely see the main bad guy and his henchmen, especially his muscled son are not effectively used in the film. The villains are intimidating and haunting but mostly, they were more like pawns in the desert. However, this is not a big problem. Everything is done as it should be. As for Tom Hardy, as a fan of him, it was a pleasure to watch him again, but I couldn't see him as Max, he was more like the son of the mad max than our old, original character. However, I liked him as a character. Mel Gibson could have joined the cast as a cameo, but it seems that he didn't want to do it. What about Furiosa hype that has shaken the world? Well, Charlize Theron was remarkable, but don't expect the most legendary character of all time in movie history or something! Not unforgettable, but a very gritty character portrait. The girls were charming and their story was sad, but maybe their surreal existence was out of place in the movie. The opening scene of the movie was disappointing for me, but then the movie turned into a breathtaking, non stop journey, an amazing freak show with fuel, machines, fire and blood! The action scenes were an example of incredible technical craftsmanship. I just want to congratulate all the cast and crew for this hard work. In comparison with the original, old trilogy, a powerful story with a development is missing here, but as a separate film, my favorite film of the year so far. There is tears, there is fun, there is fuel and there is blood!",
492,30 December 2015,valleyjohn,4, Annoying as hell,I never liked the original Mad Max movies which is why I put off watching Fury Road. I finally got around to seeing it and although better than the Mel Gibson films I still didn't like it very much. I can see why this would appeal to people . The action sequences are spectacular and the special affects are top notch but that's just not enough for me. Is a plot too much to ask? I found the constant action irritating and was relieved when there was a rare gap in the ensuing pandemonium . Another irritation is Tom Hardy. He seems to be reviving his rile as Bane ( Dark Knight Rises) by mumbling his lines. Sadly it has been announced that there will be another Mad Max film in a couple of years time. I hope I'm more successful in avoiding that one as I was with this.,
493,18 May 2015,ironhorse_iv,9," What a lovely day, to watch a good over-the-top popcorn carmaggeddon film! Mad Max: Fury Road was a lot of fun, watching.","Mad Max is back on the road to success, after years of being off course. Don't get me wrong, the original ozxploitation Mad Max film franchises (1979 to 1985) by George Miller is probably the most famous post-apocalypse films to come out of the Australian New Wave of the 1970s, but this film series hasn't aged, well. First off, Mad Max's main star, Mel Gibson, fell from public grace, due his controversy statements against Jews, women and homosexuals. Second off, the film series hit a road bump, in 1985, when the movie, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome tries a more kid friendly approach by going PG-13. It got released with mixed feelings from critics, and audience members. The 1985 sequel also didn't yield the box office results that the producers wanted. It was only moderate successful, so any plans for sequels went into development hell for thirty years. Due to those reasons, the film series almost seem like it run out of gas. It wasn't until its driver, George Miller repacked, Mad Max as Fury Road, a continuity reboot; did the engines start to move again. Fury Road, once again, tells the story of 'Mad' Max Rockatansky, now played by actor, Tom Hardy, who must teams up with the a mysterious driver Furiosa, (Charlize Theron), to help a group of sex-slaves flee from their capturer, the evil warlord, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Max and Furiosa must cross the post-apocalypse desert world in hopes of reaching, a mythic place call, the Green Place. Can they make it to the safe haven or will Joe recapture them? Watch it to find out! Without spoiling too much of the film, the film is visually impressing. The cinematography for this movie, is just as amazing. They made the Namibia deserts seem as colorful as possible in order to differentiate the film from other post-apocalyptic movies which typically have bleak desaturated colors. It remind me, so much of 1962's Lawrence in Arabia, with how visually appealing, it was to watch. This movie is a must watch in 3D for that, alone. Still, there were some things that were too gimmicky or corny. The Doof Warrior's guitar, as it flies towards the camera in Fury Road, is jarringly poorly done. Especially given the utterly flawless effects throughout the rest of the film. Another thing, that I love about the film is how over 80% of the effects seen in the film are real practical effects, stunts, make-up and sets. CGI was used sparingly mainly to enhance the Namibian landscape, remove stunt rigging and for removing Charlize Theron's left arm. The stunt work is intense. It's extremely violent, with nonstop car chase scenes, explosions, and hand to hand combat. This movie is a good example that the Academy Awards need to have a category for stunt work. Still, the movie does go over the top, unrealistic at times. It's funny, how many bullets are wasted for a post-apocalypse film. The acting is pretty good as well. Charlize Theron is great, as the female lead. She shows that female action heroes can be, awesome. The film is driven by strong women and can be seemed as a feminist movie. Mad Max is pretty much a supporting character, to be honest. Still, you see a lot of him. Tom Hardy really gets the character of Max. A man of action and of few words. He was build, to be an action star. Still, the character has a confusing, origins story. The writers try to suggest that this Max's origin is the same as the original films, but clearly something were changed. While, yes he kinda wears a near-identical outfit, while wearing a leg brace as he did at the end of 1979's Mad Max and the entirety of Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, but the movie gives him, some really haunting flashbacks, that we haven't witness, before. I don't know, where his hauntings came from or who the girl, was. It wasn't in the original films. There was a few other things to nitpick. I wish, he drove the modified police Interceptor, more and he looks a little more like Mel Gibson's Max. The movie has a lot of odd-looking supporting characters. At much, as I love the character of Nux (Nicholas Hoult). I can't buy into his heel to face turn and his love story with one of the sex slaves. It was a bit forced. Another weird moment in the film is the freaky looking side-characters. It remind me of 2006's 300 in a bit when it comes to the grotesque. Still, this movie makes more sense, since it take place, after a nuclear holocaust, but there were some really over the top gross-villains. It makes me, wonder if the water at the citadel is honestly, safe to drink. In my opinion, it seem poisoned. Overall: This demolition derby testosterone full film is a lot of fun, to watch. It's amazing that Miller has been in charge of the Mad Max series for so many decades, and I'll be looking forward to the next series of Mad Max films, from him. This is a must-watch. You have to be crazy, not to watch this film.",

Max actually was on a leash in the beginning. Other than some grunts and one or two word responses from Max this movie was focused on Charlize Theron's character which was glorified to the Max(pun firmly intended), and shown to be almost super human to the point of accomplishing stunts, acrobatics and feats of strength that a man would never be able to do let alone a woman. Max was reduced to being one step up from a caveman and clueless for the most part as to what was going on. Tom Hardy should be ashamed for taking the role.

514,27 May 2015,soneil12,8, Good but lacking something,I quite liked this movie but perhaps not as much as I expected. I'm generally pretty cynical when it comes to sequels these days because there are so many (and a lot of them are terrible). I was genuinely expecting this one to be good though. I did enjoy it but it just seemed to be lacking a certain something. I'm not sure exactly what. The action scenes were every bit as good as what we've seen in previous Mad Max films. The look and feel were consistent with previous films so it definitely 'felt' like a Mad Max film (using plenty of Aussie actors like in the originals helped). The story was a bit light but honestly I think the same could be said about the other Mad Max films. I thought the acting was pretty good. Theron was superb as always. Tom Hardy had some very big shoes to fill as Max. I thought he was good but he somehow seemed to lack Mel Gibson's presence in the role and faded quite a bit in comparison to other main characters. The villains I found a bit underwhelming. There was the main villain of course but I think that perhaps there were far too many lesser villains and it got to the point where you almost lose track of who the good guys are actually up against.,
515,31 March 2017,kingscollegeca,1, Check your brain at the door and you might enjoy this,"As many have said, this is basically a two hour car chase. A very violent, yet silly car chase. The violence is well done and realistic if you're into that, but the world created in this film doesn't stand up to even the slightest scrutiny. All of the vehicles run perpetually, they never need refueling. The villains seem to have a lot of advanced technology yet live like beasts. The land is said to be poisoned and barren, so how have the old ladies we encounter been surviving all these years? I guess they don't need to eat, kind of like the vehicles never need a fill up. The war rig's tires are shredded and then later they are fine. Max seems to have an unlimited supply of blood. Max says that if they bring as much extra gas as they can carry on a motorcycle, they should be able to run for 160 days! Really? I know motorcycles get good mileage, but come on! Again, is this a primitive post war apocalyptic world, or do they have advanced, high mileage technology? It's all over the map. There are many more examples of such silliness.

Every single aspect of this film is a travesty compared to the original. The plot, the acting, the costumes, the dialogue, the soundtrack, the action, the pacing. It's all bombastic over the top nonsense. And loud. Very very loud. I have never come across a film that so disappointed me from the opening scene. I watched it unfold and thought, ""Oh for crying out loud, what is this? Surely it can't all be this bad!"" But no, it starts off ponderous and loud, and gets no better. Disappointment turned to frustration and anger. There's even the cliché of a female character gradually losing her clothes that's from 1980s teen slasher films and parodied in Galaxy Quest. And did I mention some guitar playing that seems to be taken directly from Todd and the Book of Pure Evil?

Basically in the future the world has become a desert wasteland and civilisation has collapsed following a nuclear war. Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy), a survivor and loner, is captured by the War Boys, the army of the tyrannical Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), and taken to the Citadel, Max is designated a universal blood donor and used as a ""blood bag"" for sick Wild Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult). Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) meanwhile is driving an armoured war rig to collect gasoline, she drives off- route, and Joe realises that his five wives - women selected for breeding - are missing, so he leads his whole army to chase after her, with the aid of Gas Town and the Bullet Farm. Max continues to supply blood strapped onto the front Nux's car who is also in pursuit, Joe's forces and Furiosa's rig ensues in a battle, but she is able to evade the pursuers driving into a sand storm, except Nux who is prepared to sacrifice himself, the car crashes and Max is able to escape, dragging an unconscious Nux by his chain. Max finds Furiosa accompanied by the five wives: The Splendid Angharad (Transformers: Dark of the Moon's Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), Capable (Riley Keough), Cheedo the Fragile (Courtney Eaton), Toast the Knowing (Zoë Kravitz, Lenny's daughter) and the Dag (Abbey Lee), who are repairing the rig, he attempts to steal it, but the kill switch disables the truck, so he reluctantly allows Furiosa and the wives to accompany him, Nux returns to Joe. Furiosa has agreed to exchange gasoline for passage, and drives through biker gang territory into a narrow gang, but Joe's gang are in hot pursuit, the bikers detonate the canyon walls to block the path, Max and Furiosa defeat many of the bikers, but Joe's vehicle evades the blockade and attacks the rig, Nux manages to board it. The rig escapes, but heavily pregnant Angharad falls from it and is run over, killing her and her child, Furiosa tells Max that she is heading for the ""Green Place"", a location she remembers from her youth, Capable finds Nux hiding, she consoles him as he is distraught for failing Joe. At night, the rig gets stuck in mud, Joe's approaching forces are slowed by explosives, but Joe's ally, the Bullet Farmer (Richard Carter) continues to pursue, Nux helps them get away and Furiosa shoots and blinds the Bullet Farmer, Max walks away for a moment to confront them, and returns with guns and ammunition. Dawn breaks and rig travels through swampland and desert, eventually coming across a naked woman trapped in a high cage, Max suspects a trap, but calling out her former clan affiliation she summons her group, they recognise her as part of their clan, but Furiosa is distraught to be told that they have already passed the Green Place, now inhospitable. The group agree to ride motorbikes and the rig across the immense salt flats in the hope of finding somewhere to live, Max was originally going to stay behind, but following visions of his dead daughter he convinces the group to return to the Citadel, because of its ample water and greenery that Joe keeps from the survivors, and they plan to trap Joe's gang in the bikers' canyon. The group start their journey back to the Citadel, Joe spots them and realises what they are doing, they are attacked by his gang and Furiosa is badly wounded, the rig is slowed by Joe's car, while Max fights with Joe's son Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones). Toast gets captured and put on Joe's car, but Joe is distracted by her, and his mask hooked to his car's rotating wheels, tearing his face off and killing him, while Nux sacrifices himself by destroying the rig, blocking the canyon, killing Rictus, and the group are able to escape in Joe's car. Max transfuses his blood to save Furiosa and help her injuries, at the Citadel the surviving citizens are overjoyed that Joe is dead, Furiosa and the wives are raised on a platform by the War Boys and allowed to open the water gates and rinse the people, Max stays below, he and Furiosa share a glance before he disappears into the crowd. Also starring X-Men: Days of Future Past's Josh Helman as Slit, John Howard as The People Eater, Iota as The Doof Warrior and Angus Sampsonas The Organic Mechanic. Hardy gives a magnetic performance as the man who only utters a few words, Theron with her shaved head is terrific, Hoult is unrecognisable as the pale and scarred freak, and the supporting cast all do very well also. The story is simple enough to keep up with, the special effects and makeup throughout is fantastic, and the chase sequences accompanied with over-the-top violence is exciting, it is a thrill ride you will absolutely want to get on, a brilliantly entertaining futuristic action adventure. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects, it won the BAFTAs for Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design and Best Makeup and Hair, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

I am very cynical with people who have had gushing 10/10 reviews on this site. How can this film rate so highly with so many 1/10 reviews? actually the most I have ever seen. Nothing in this movie is explained due to the almost non existent dialogue from all the characters. You are meant to just guess at the visual meaning of everything. The plot did not make sense and it was just one endless car chase scenario all seemingly without any refuelling required. No one in this film required sleep or food it seems! There were many attempted throwbacks to the previous Mad Max movies but they fell flat and were soon forgotten in amongst all the meaningless violence that was slapping you in the face. I could continue on an on but many before me have already expressed similar findings so I will stop here. At least I know now why friends recommended not to see this movie and I can understand why people got up and left the theatre during this two hours of mindless rubbish.,

The movie is 2 hours of car crashes mixed in with a bit of fighting. There is no plot, no interest in characters, no given reason for the fighting. This could of been a great landscape if laid out and described better. I really had no idea where they were or why earth was the way it was. It was tough to choose a side and root for one over the other as neither side was properly laid out for the audience. As far as I know both sides were 'bad' and they were fighting over gas and water control. A little bit of back story would of been great, I love movies that have a distinct before and after taste to them. We really had no glimpse into the life of the villain and what made him the bad guy. He had the perfect look and voice of a villain but really didn't shine in that role very much. I was expecting something amazing and left with a bad taste in my mouth. 2 out of 5 of us fell asleep during the movie, and I couldn't wait for it to be over.

Teetering on ill-logic and sense; wandering aimlessly between cinematographic brilliance and irrelevance; dialog that is so shallow and often head-scratching that you would have to fight your sensibilities to continue watching this movie or to end the suffering as these waves of discontent build to a crescendo. Usually, the actors make wonderful choices (Theron and Hardy) in roles but even they couldn't safe this one. I will say that a positive is the redemptive value women are afforded in this movie. Even though the general theme of most movies is hyper-steroid, over-testosteroned men with dysfunctional social tendencies and the submissive, subjugated women subjects...this one offers a bone.

534,2 April 2016,karalisge,2, Wish i turned it off earlier.,Even there are some quite interesting action scenes this movie didn't worth the title MadMax at all. I have watched the first two sequels soo many years ago and i do believe that they are superior to this. The movie was boring and without a meaning. Without a purpose. With far from logical reality scenes it represented a big nothing to the real MadMax and his purpose: Survival. This film is produced with raw brutality in mind and everything comes second. It really failed to make me wonder what comes next. The protagonist is such a common like the man next door lacking every character's aspect that previous movies introduced.

And it has nothing to do with the original Mad Max (except name). And I might say, although the original Mad Max isn't the best movie I ever watched, it was a masterpiece compared to this one!

542,16 February 2020,rivertam26,9, Truly remarkable,"Initially when first seeing this I was a bit underwhelmed. I mean I thought it was cool but it felt very ""style over substance"". Years late I've watched it countless times and I definitely have a different opinion of it. Its without a doubt one of the wildest, creative, pulse pounding, unique films ever made. The star of the movie is of course Furiosa played by a fierce Charlize Theron whom justly won an oscar for it. Nicholas Hoult is the second most interesting character and his journey is truly emotional and engaging. And well the title character Mad Max is the third most interesting character. Tom Hardy does a solid job of playing him crazy but the role is underwritten and mostly depends on his impressive physicality. Set years after the third film and Max has failed to help the tribe of children. He's constantly haunted by them and finds himself suddenly thrust into a harrowing situation in which Furiosa betrays her boss and decides to help his wives to escape. The action scenes are thrilling and have a real raw energy to them. The score is wonderfully intense and epic and the cinematography and stunt work are something truly magical and need to be seen to be believed. In the end it's not completely able to shake some thin spots but overall it's one of the best films ever made.",

544,2 July 2016,amo_mdd,5, Lower than my expectations and a bit monotonous,"I think the title of my review sums up pretty well my feelings after watching this movie. I believe the Mad Max universe was a great setting and opportunity for something great, building upon the history of the previous Mad Max movies. Instead, there was minimal exploration and discovery of this post apocalyptic world and its societies which where there only as the background. The script was rather monotonous as for the most part this movie is about vehicle chases with fighting. Even if those scenes took half that much it would still be a bit more than needed. The acting was underwhelming to say the least. Not sure what I was expecting but really now, do Tom Hardy or Charlize Theron consider this as a high-mark of their acting careers? The special effects were really were made, with the most impressive probably being that huge storm part, but at some points it was so much that you just knew you were watching 90% post processing and little real camera work. Could it be that I'm looking at this through nostalgia-tinted glasses? It might be, but that doesn't make this movie more interesting or exciting because essentially this is what I feel at the end; that I would not spend 2 more hours watching Fury Road a second time or easily recommend it to anybody. Let's hope the next one is better!",

If you are into films that have no story then this will be for you, but personally I like films with a good story that are enjoyable to watch. I could not wait for this film to finish.

Max had some flashbacks that were never explained at all and what little dialog the movie had sounded like a 12-year-old wrote it. Yes, there were some cool car crashes and action sequences, but how that makes this a ""masterpiece"" is beyond me.

Charlize Theron is escaping an evil warlord who treats his women brutally, but unfortunately, in a post-apocalyptic future, that brutal environment would likely happen, especially to beautiful women. These women would not be ordering men around or fighting them in hand-to-hand combat. I do not say this because I think that the story should only have submissive women, but think of Game of Thrones and Cersei Lannister. She works toward her own ends using her womanly wiles, in a realistic environment. Though the action sequences are amazing, I thing that George Miller did a net horrible job with Mad Max Fury Road.",

569,16 May 2015,d3jean,3, Overrated Mediocrity. What a Disappointment.,"What a shame!!! That's all i could say as I left the cinema Thursday night, after attending the first showing. Before i start my review for this film, I'd like to share my thoughts on the first three as they were an integral part of my childhood and hold some nostalgic reverence for me as an adult. Mad Max is a film i don't particularly care for as I find it a bit too downbeat and low budget for my taste. It's also visually different from the other three films as it takes place in a vast country wasteland, where as the others take place in dessert locals that give off a more grand scope, that's severely lacking in the first film. The first film also lacks any iconic action scenes or a memorable villain that would become a trademark in the later films. The Road Warrior is a film I enjoy immensely and don't really have much else to add that hasn't already been said by everyone over the last 34 years. Beyond Thunderdome is a film I find disjointed. The one hand all the scenes directed by George Miller are amazing and well done, the thunderdome fight (still one of the greatest in cinema history), and the end chase sequence are exciting and hint at the great film it could have been had he directed the whole movie. The rest of the film however featuring the lost children and anything to do with the people of Bartertown and their politics is just annoying and slow's the movie down to a crawl. The Tina Turner song ""We Don't Need Another Hero"" however, is classic and one of my favorite songs of all time. So now we come to Fury Road a film I've been looking forward too ever since I saw the first trailer that premiered at Comic Con last summer. The trailer made the film look epic and visually stunning, featuring things we had never seen before on film. Months I waited for it's release and with each day drawing closer and closer, my anticipation grew. Cut to earlier this week as the reviews from many professional film critic outlets came pouring in. They were declaring this film to be a masterpiece and one of the greatest action movies of all time. I couldn't believe what i was hearing and waited with baited breath to see it on Thursday night. Skip to 2 hours and change later and even now as i type this several days later, ""WHAT THE HELL IS EVERYBODY RAVING ABOUT!!!!!!"". Seriously, I'm as perplexed by all this as other negative reviewers are. This solidifies my thinking that film critics are irrelevant and don't know what they're talking about. Same goes for Rotten Tomatoes a site I won't ever be going on again, they're a joke. Back to the film though, I'm still trying to figure out how something that looked so groundbreaking and revolutionary from the marketing, become so boring and uninvolving as you sit down and watch it in the theater. The answer, the story sucks. Oh wait, I forgot there was no story, just a bunch of chasing and then more chasing, followed by more chasing, before we take a detour in the second act, where our characters literally do nothing but sit around at night, contemplating about the situation they're in and how they intend to get out of it for 30 straight minutes. This section slows the movie down to a Terence Malick sized crawl as we the audience become restless hoping for something to happen soon and happen quick. The cast is also disappointing with Tom Hardy being a poor imitator of Mel Gibson. It's not entirely his fault though as he isn't really the main character. That's right, Max hardly does anything in this movie. Yes, he beats some people up and gets involved in some of the action, however he's merely taking orders from Charlize Theron's character and just seems completely uninterested in everything that goes on around him. Theron is fine in the movie but again is given little to work with. As for the other females, they're not even worth talking about as they barely leave an impression on the audience and are not developed in the slightest. The villain was cool to look at but again underutilized and nonthreatening. The movies looks nice and is fairly well directed by George Miller but has a feeling of a been there done that feel that indicated that George Miller was only interested in creating cool visuals to distract us from his shitty script. Movies need more than pretty pictures to keep us engaged, we need strong characters and story to make us wanna come back and watch a film over and over, which this film fails to do. So in ending this review, I want to say to all the masses out there praising this to the heavens, that you really should ask for more from your movies because if this is what we accept now as good films than cinema is dead my friends. In closing I thought this film was pretty disappointing and now has made me sworn off from seeing anymore Mad Max films in the future. So no I don't recommend this film if u half to see it wait for redbox and watch the first 30 minutes which admittedly are great but be forewarned it all goes downhill after that. Thanks for reading my review.",

575,24 May 2015,stanrogersmith,4, Good and Disappointing at the same time,"I've just returned from seeing Mad Max Fury Road, and on the ride home I was reflecting upon what I just watched. I'll start with the pros - non-stop action start to finish if your thing is watching crazy make-shift vehicles chase down a tanker truck and fire bomb, harpoon, and shoot it up. It seems like this was just one long chase. the cons - and here is where I'm disappointed - I'm a big Tom Hardy fan, but he doesn't get the opportunity to shine here. Why not? Its like the third Hobbit movie, where the main character Bilbo is reduced to a support character. That's what happens to Max in this movie. I won't even refer to him as MAD Max, because there's no backstory to let us know WHY Max should be MAD. Plus, the dialogue, as in WHAT dialogue?? They gave Hardy like 30 words total to say. How the hell is the guy supposed to build a character on that? More time was given to Charlize, which is OK because she is such a great actress, but how about letting her look a little better instead of the concentration camp haircut and the Terminator forearm. The special effects were great, plenty of action, but at the end when the kid overturns the rig, wouldn't it have been more fitting to have an explosion THEN??? And another thing, in this post apocalyptic world, I guess there is just an endless supply of water in a desert, huh? I mean so much that with the flip of a switch gallons upon gallons can simply be wasted??? Oh, and another thing - how the hell did those old women survive out in the desert for like 7000+ days (according to Theron's character) WITHOUT ANY WATER? And why would they have simply stuck around there anyhow if, by their own admission, the muddy area that the truck was getting stuck in had become a toxic site years before anyhow? Did George Miller consider any of this when he was reviewing the storyline, or did he simply take his gazillion dollar check to the bank, made sure it cleared, then said ""OK, lets do whatever the hell we want now""? Finally, one last rant, if I may - who the hell are the morons giving 10 star reviews? I mean, seriously??? Overall, I'm really more disappointed than anything else in this.

584,26 May 2015,zardoz-13,9, Max Is Back with Max Action,"Moviegoers old enough to remember the 1980s may cherish memories of those gonzo, post-apocalyptic, B-movies where humans struggled to survive in either an urban or desert wasteland against gloomy odds. Those low-budget, R-rated, schlock sagas with gladiatorial looking psychotic freaks careening around in beatnik-style buggies straight out of an auto graveyard were both 'drive-in' movie and VHS favorites. These lowbrow actioneers were definitely an acquired taste. Exploitation classics like ""1990: The Bronx Warriors,"" ""Warriors of the Wasteland,"" ""2019 - After the Fall of New York,"" ""Exterminators Of The Year 3000,"" and ""Warrior of the Lost World"" proliferated during the 80s after ""Max Mad"" surprised Hollywood and generated a market for this violent, slam-bang, dystopian nihilism. According to DVD Times, ""'Mad Max' was shot on a budget of 400,000 Australian Dollars, which is a tiny budget for such an action packed film. Up until 'Blair Witch' it held the record for greatest profit to budget ratio (It grossed $100 million USD eventually)."" Not only did director George Miller make a superstar out of Mel Gibson with ""Mad Max"" (1979), but he also ushered in the grungy, low-class, genre that eventually inspired big-budget replicas. Does anybody remember Kevin Costner's ""Waterworld?"" The studio that produced ""Waterworld"" sought to remake ""Mad Max,"" but they wanted to stage it on the high seas. Thirty years after he wrapped the third entry in the ""Mad Max"" trilogy with ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" (1985), George Miller has revived the post-nuke warrior in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" with Tom Hardy taking over Mel Gibson's role. About four years ago, Paul Miller—a Michigan native no relation to George—helmed a fan film ""Mad Max Renegade"" that filled in the gap between the first ""Mad Max"" and ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior."" If you aren't a 1980s movie aficionado, you may have trouble appreciating ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" with Charlize Theron taking star billing over Tom Hardy. ",

The movie raises a bunch of questions, but gives answers to a very few of them. Tom Hardy is doing his best in the character of Max trying not to say a word until the end of the movie, but even his stoicism can not save the day.

602,28 May 2015,drqshadow-reviews,10," The Most Intense, Electric, Absurdly Rewarding Ride I've Taken in Years","A triumphant return to the reckless mayhem and guilt-free indulgence of the early '80s action/adventure bubble. Max puts foot to floor right from the opening bell and never lets up, somehow topping itself over and over again, even when it seems like there's nowhere left to go. It's joyous anarchy, a world that thrives on all of society's dirty secrets; completely post-apocalyptic crazy but also a little more familiar than we'd like to admit. Of course, it's a visual powerhouse - a glowing example of art direction, stunt driving, cinematography and character design that's damn near unrivaled in modern cinema - but it's also an audio behemoth. Like Inception's deep bellow or Terminator's ominous rumble, Fury Road can convey a looming sense of dread through its frequent, effective use of bass. You feel that rumble? The ride's starting back up again. Junkie XL's accompanying soundtrack is a perfect tonal match, the right blend of fuzzy, maxed-out guitar licks and incessant, pounding tribal drums. Perhaps most impressively, the film doesn't feel obligated to dig up every last bit of backstory on its way to the finish line. If anything, it revels in leaving that to the viewer, whose imagination is bound to fill in the blanks for such a broad, wildly eccentric cast of characters far better anyway. It's a raucous success, a lethal dose of sensory overload that hits like a two-hour surge of adrenaline.

And this movie accomplishes that ambitious task flawlessly. In this post-apocalyptic wasteland, our anti-hero Max Rockatansky, is captured by the ruthless war boys, who are under the command of the wasteland's dictator, Immortan Joe, who has power over the remaining lives on this deserted planet by controlling the only source of running water guarded by his lovely sons and his war boy army who are on the never ending quest for gasoline, weapons, and utter chaos with the hopes of arriving at the silver and chrome gates of Valhalla. In order to save what remains of the planet from total destruction and slavery, Imperial Furiosa, the badass one armed truck driver and expert sniper will need to team up with Max and the renegade war boy Nux in order to rescue the enslaved wives of Immortan Joe, and find the ""Green Place"" in order to save them selves and find hope in the never ending suffering of the wasteland. What separates an action film like Fury Road from movies directed by Michael Bay or any other boring mindless action film, is that the action in Fury Road means something. The constant fighting and amazingly choreographed chases our characters go through, they go through it because they'll find redemption not only in themselves but also in the post-apocalyptic nightmare in which they come from. The action has significant meaning to the overall theme of this movie which is hope. And on a technical level, this movie is breathtaking. The chases are real, the explosions are real, the vehicles ARE REAL, and because of that, George Miller has a made a film that will forever be timeless. This movie is amazing, I was literally sweating after seeing it in the theaters. It's about as visceral and compelling as an action film gets. 10/10.",

628,21 May 2015,hailhydra86,8, Fury Road is an extravaganza non-stop action fuel injection.,"Oh what a day! What a lovely day! I am a Mad Max fan, having seen the three mad Max films at age of eleven. I adored the films in all their weird and action-packed glory and they have only gotten better with age. George Miller was very clever in not doing the ""reboot"" a remake of Mad Max, revealing how Max Rockantasky became The Road Warrior, George Miller decided that the reboot will take place in the post- apocalyptic Australia, years after the new Max lost his family, because he did not wish to do a remake or retell the story that had already been told and had wanted to update the universe and the wasteland and wanted new movie goers to remember Max as a man with nothing to lose after losing his family. I see Fury Road as a pseudo sequel to Road Warrior and it has the quality of such. Over 80% of the effects seen in the film are real practical effects, stunts, make-up and sets, the action and production design is easily among the top. Using that visual frame of reference, Miller is able to use the action, not just to have cool moments and move the story forward, but also add to the great character work done within the action scenes. The characters are defined, informed and developed by the actions that they take without having the need to announce what they learn or spell out how they feel to the audience. It's all in what Miller is able to capture on camera with the help of cinematographer, John Seale, delivering Oscar-calibre work. People is calling the film ""Mad Maxine: Femmy Road"" (aka feminist utterly trash) That is a load of rubbish. Charlize Theron is perfect as Furiosa. Mad Max always had powerful females: In Mad Max we have an old women holds up an entire gang with a shotgun, in Road Warrior the warrior woman stabbing blocks and killing them all day long and in Beyond Thunderdome Tina Turner took control of an entire town and created the thunder dome. Get familiar with the old movies before freaking out about the new one. I dislike Tom Hardy but his excellent as Max. Hugh Keays-Byrne (Toecutter in Mad Max) as Immortan Joe is perfect. He was brilliant. His voice was extremely menacing, and was portrayed as godlike. What I mean by that is he is worshipped by all as a God.

Goes down straight to business. Directing from George Miller was a work of art..Other action directors should take note. The cast and production were sublime. Tom Hardy was superb...again in a movie where he was given limited script, he shined with his ability to act without having to speak too much. I assure you he will be one of the greatest actors if not the greatest by the end of his career..such a versatile actor..Now people say Furiosa was the main character in the movie..It probably was a little more of her story but i felt the 2 characters were equally important and given their fair share of time on the screen.

This film is set in an apocalyptic era, of course, which causes it to be a breeding ground for a lot of action and to me that's what made this film so great. Almost from beginning to end there's enough nonstop action to keep any action film fan satisfied.

Even the quality of today's CGI-effects still never looks so good like the old type explosions and stunts like they were done in this movie. Frank Millers visuality is beautiful to watch and movies red/brown landscape looks almost magical. Movie is full throttle action from start to finish. That can be a strength of this movie, but it is also the weakness of it. Because of all the action thru out entire movie it's ending won't blow your mind. Also there are some weakness in it's script. Script isn't very clever but it's weakness is buried with all the action. Tom Hardy is good choice to play Mad Max even the story won't give to him much enough to shine in his role. Despite it's weakness in story Mad Max is still one of the best action movies this year so far. With better script it would be perfect.",

The character of Furiosa herself is a revelation, someone you don't normally get to see in a big budget action blockbuster: She is on an equal level playing field as Max, both important, and one helping the other when the situation calls for it. She's also the more interesting character, going through a deeper change and a more emotional journey. It's a good thing, then, that Max is resorted as a background character, which may anger some people, but it works here.",

The story is set in a desert wasteland and the world and civilisation has collapsed as a result of wars and dwindling resources. Fury Road takes place in a that wasteland deep in the apocalypse where War Lords own territory and have created settlements. We follow Max as he's hunted and gets into a chase with the War Boys which serves the main villain, Immortan Joe. Shortly after that we get introduced to Furiousa which is the second main character.

I set out with a positive view imagining that it would be somewhere between the original Mad Max mixed with some modern whiz bang action and a touch of Star Wars fantasy thrown in. I was horribly disappointed. For a while, I thought it might be a reasonable 'take off' of an action movie with it's ridiculous script and bizarre attempts at humour, but to no avail. In reality, there is no story, the acting is generally abysmal, the script is inane, the 'scenery' boring and the action comedic at best.

695,25 January 2017,boxing-38801,9, For all audiences that love action,"9/10. It's action packed and well balanced with a story. I've never seen a movie that has so greatly balanced the cliché of damsels in distress (while not making it cliché in a way) and also evening it out with a story where women rise from actual oppression. I think this is for any audience type and can be looked at in any view whether it be a feminist perspective of ""the rise against the patriarchy"" or just another save the society from this dystopian nightmare. I went into this absolutely hating the style, the stupid guitar guy and drum people, the whole world's look, character's actions, and the slower start introducing Max and all, but I ended up really admiring it. This movie also does a survival story (@gravity) in the middle of nowhere and doesn't ruin anything when it has not that much dialogue. With barely any talking between the group, you sense the bond the have with all their actions, facial expressions, and etc. It's great movie even though I still have problems with the lack of some dialogue and all the flashbacks, the villain who wasn't even powerful (maybe that's the point ey), and society but either way it's a stunning movie.",

Tom Hardy fills the role that Mel left behind in the mid eighties, though this time Max hardly has more than a few lines of dialogue in the entire film, but then he was never a big talker, with a bulk of the attention and lines left for solely Charlize Theron's character. This is a visually epic looking film with TONS of loud, fast well shot action, though I missed the more subtle elements of the other instalments that this doesn't have as much of. Plot wise this is a near remake of beyond thunderdome with a few different ideas running through, some of them good, some not so great. In terms of all-out action this is a must watch.

Theron is impressive as always as. tom hardy as supporting main character Max is not impressive. his mediocre acting and lethargic entry do not contribute to total scene. i was expecting someone sharp in action like Jason statham or splendid actor in recent scene good as Ryan Gosling at all. by the way i don't like storyline too, but action is good and constant. nux played by Nicolas hoult British actor is most controversial character. first he was orthodox religion fanatic fascinated by immortal Joe and vikings too. he believed in Valhalla(Nordic paradise) and then he turned his life views by 180° and became a member of running party of furiosa. furiosa is most stupidest female name for leading female role. i don't heard name stupid like that not even in Spain or Mexico. furiosa??? villains do not look scary like in original mad max 1 or 2. only action is constant but storyline is not impressive. furiosa stealing pregnant and virgins, than escaping. she leading to gasoline city but she dragging another tank with 300 gallons of fuel? then leading left to enemy territory. and 50 vehicles cant stop one truck? why they didn't simple shoot to thires? in that case film wouldn't be attractive or interesting. that no longer i must admit i am not impressed and i was expecting much more. mad max 1 and 2 are much better movies.",

717,26 September 2015,joey-612-186288,5, Wouldn't pay to see it,"The story is formulaic. The character development is shallow, weak and trite. The plot is more biased than the original series, which were more dynamic of a story as it had one side being bullied but it ended up with the man in the middle of both sides who were jockeying for power as they are both exposed for their partaking of greed and pillaging while in the seat of power; this film is very one dimensional and has one side evil and the other side all great and noble. Instead of focusing on one man's motivations of intense survival and/or revenge, as the originals, it instead played more into the act of a social tribalism with everyone just coming together, pretty much instantly, because they like each other for being beautiful. With one side evil and ugly and the other side beautiful and very great.

So even though the opening scene had a voice over of Hardy doing some sort of cross between South African, Australian, Kiwi and Texan, I persevered only to be met with a boring action movie with no story or acting.

But it isn't a Mad Max film. It's kind off a late spin-off, there were many after the first Mad max films. And as thus I can appreciate this film. But as a Mad Max film, I give a solid 2/10. Why? No real explanation or exploration (character building) into Max's ever growing madness but some vague flashbacks and references to the old Mad Max films. The over the top action-scenes, greatly cgi'd though, were most of the time too long and only there to fill up this movie with yet more action, so that the story was left floating around(which explains the lack off ). But as said in the beginning it's an action film and there is plenty of it in this movie. Too bad they lure people into thinking that this film is the real deal and feed on the franchise.

While the film is called Mad Max Fury Road, the film belongs to Charlize Theron.

His acting was poor. He barely even spoke. Not that Max was much of a talker, but it would make you wonder if he had his tongue cut out at first. As the headline says, Charlize Theron was the true star of this film and gave it a world. Aside from her role, this movie would be rather boring, as it had many dragged out scenes, but all in all pretty good movie, but they needed a better max. Hardy just didn't cut it at all.",
756,22 May 2015,KineticSeoul,8, One heck of a thrill ride,"So when it comes to the story, it might seem like there really isn't anything special when it comes to the story. The plot is about going from point A to point B and back to point A again. Now the ""Mad Max"" franchise is considered cult films and although I am not a big fan of this franchise but I thought it does have certain imageries that make it stand out. Although the third installment was the weakest and is probably why there wasn't a new ""Mad Max"" movie for many years. I will say ""Fury Road"" is one heck of a insane experience, filled with chaos and madness. Again what makes this movie stand out is the crazy imagery and atmosphere. If you are a fan of steampunk style genres than you will probably have a blast with this one. This movie is wild and crazy and yet there wasn't really any shaky cam and yet the cinematography is really well done and super cool. Now I still think Mel Gibson did a better job of play Max, mainly because of the insane look in Mel's eyes, but Tom Hardy bring something new. He sort of reminded me of his character from Lawless a bit. Which is this confused badbass. Although the title says ""Mad Max"" the really title for this should have been ""Badass Chick with the Metal Arm"". Because Charlize Theron seemed to be the main protagonist throughout most of the film. And she is badass as a badass female lead can get. Call me blind, but I never really found Charlize to be attractive, sure I could understand why she is known to be one of the most beautiful actresses in the business. But man she was really hot in this one. Which shows that sometimes more than appearance how you carry yourself can really bring out the attractiveness. This is a exploitation film for the mainstream audiences, that is a fun thrill ride from beginning to end without it dragging out. Overall, this is a film that almost every movie buffs can have a good time with. I usually don't watch the same movie twice in theaters, but I did for this one.

Where Max(Hardy) comes in, I don't understand. I take it was captured, and he escaped, but was recaptured.

I love so much about this film it's hard to even describe, from how Hardy shows emotions and feelings without even speaking a word for the first half over. I loved the cinematography, there is a scene where the characters are driving toward a gigantic sandstorm and it is so beautiful. The actions scenes are basically unparalleled, the costume design and sound is amazing. From my knowledge this film is a continuation of the previous 3 films, and the fact that this both continues on that but also opens it up completely to new audiences is amazing. I absolutely loved this movie, I especially loved the colour pallet changes, at day time the desert is orange tinted and you can almost feel how incredibly dry and terrible it is. However at night the movie turns to a dark blue, showing the beauty that exists in it. I loved this film, I don't really know what else to say. It's a movie you can either watch and look for the hidden meaning, or you can just turn your brain off. One last thing I loved was the fact that Hardy is not some sort of messiah character, he just kind of is there. This makes me want to watch the older movies, and I just might do that at some point.

There was more ham in the acting than you'll find in New York deli. Some scenes did seem to be inspired by the all-time great post apocalypse movie ""A Boy and His Dog."" By inspired I mean damn near plagiarized. The movie tries to make up for it's lack of depth with over the top special effects. This is so typical of Hollywood efforts.

The characters are really interesting. This movie finally gets the female action hero right. The movie is as much a Mad Max movie as it is a Furiosa movie. The story is not that complicated, but it has layers of deeper meaning to it, which you can choose to ignore and just enjoy an action movie, or give it some thoughts. Either way, it's a very good movie. The desert landscape is beautiful! The vehicles and machines are very detailed and look great. What also stood out to me was the score by Junkie XL.

This doesn't make any sense at all. If you saw the other mad max movies, you should know what to expect. If you saw the trailer, the deduction is the same, and if you appreciate solid movies with great storyline, you probably should watch drama, and not action. You go to see a movie with this name: ""MAD MAX"", you saw the trailer, you probably watched or at least have read something about the previous mad max movies, and still you wanted to see a movie with a great storyline!...something is escaping me...whatever!

Sadly as the end credits rolled, I only felt relief that it was over. The cinematography was beautiful, the action scenes well done, and everything had a glorious sense of momentum. Sadly these factors alone aren't enough to make a good film. Where things really fell apart for me was the poor dialogue & lack of any character building. The action was frantic, but without investing any time in the characters it was essentially meaningless. The few occasions where an attempt was made to create some emotion or character depth were woefully inept & even jarring at times. It soon became clear that the film could only be enjoyed in terms of action, but even that became too repetitive, like an overblown never ending repetition of the final chase scene from Mad Max 2.",

Personally, I don't enjoy the genre of action movies as a whole for the most part. The whole car chase, explosions, and demolition concept gets very old, very fast. However, for this movie, that is literally all that happened. It was one gigantic car chase with no reasoning behind it, no character development, no plot, absolutely nothing. I can appreciate that these effects were somewhat hard to create, and I give props to the editors, but this was just overall absolutely horrendous. Sitting down for over an hour to watch this made me feel as if I had lost over half of my brain cells, and may as well have fallen over and started oozing out of my mouth by the time it was finished. Unless you're a person obsessed with watching stuff blow up, or someone who can somehow suffer through this movie even without any plot whatsoever, definitely skip this one; I promise, you will not be missing out on much of anything.",

I'd like to see the next movie maybe be a prequel and talk bout what Joe's back story was and what he used to be like. Could be really be Goose? I am not sure. But his horse tooth mask was really neat. As for Max, well let's just say he didn't talk too much. I like his way of speaking though. Kind of reminded me of Bane from Batman actually. haha. The rest of the movie was good. I noticed that they never really stopped almost ever. Even to fix the vehicle they would just keep driving. This was really neat. Did you notice that there was a big difference in color between night and day shooting? This was a nod to the old school which I really appreciated. So, if you like your movies packed with action, you will like this movie. There are also some new techniques of fighting introduced into the fold in Mad Max.

Not only did he deliver a movie that was worthy of Max, he delivered a movie that was so far beyond my expectations for this movie. Fury Road has to be one of the best action movies I have ever seen, the action sequences are just phenomenal and amazing in the fact that most of it was real and not CGI. The cars and characters are just amazing and as insane as they should be in the post apocalyptic world of Max and the scenery is both beautiful and cruel.

793,9 January 2016,johnplocar,10, Best action film I've seen in oh so long...oh so good!,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"": This was my absolute, most anticipated film for the entire year. And to just get this immediately out of the way, this film did not in any single way whatsoever disappoint me. It has been days since I've seen the film and I'm still pumped about it. ""Fury Road"" is a masterpiece. That is exactly what it is and there is not another word that describes it any better. It is a masterpiece in every sense of the word in terms of action, concept, writing, character, style, effects, acting, sheer filmmaking. I grew up knowing of the ""Mad Max"" franchise but I didn't really grow up with it other than the glimpses I had gotten and the few scenes I caught on television as a kid. Not until I got into my late teens that I caught the first Mad Max movie on TV one night and I liked it, but it wasn't until the second viewing a few years later that I fell in love with it. It was something that for some reason or another went over my head the first go around, but when it finally clicked I went straight into watching the second film ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"". At the time I was determined to not let the second film one go over my head like its predecessor, and I fell for ""Road Warrior"" right away. To me, the first two movies are some of the greatest action films of all time; although that is pretty commonly said about ""Road Warrior"", the original I think is pretty underrated. Now, ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"" I honestly don't like much at all. There's really no hate that I have for ""Thunderdome"", but there not a whole lot for me to enjoy about it either. Mel Gibson is still good in the role and that's about it. Then when I came across the rumor of ""Fury Road"", at first I was a little skeptical but once I saw a trailer and some still images, any skepticism I previously had completely subsided and was replaced with excitement. If this film ended up being bad, you have no idea how depressed I would be. The fact that this actually somehow exceeded my expectations is beyond comprehension. ""Thunderdome"" wishes it could have been this. For a film being in production hell for 30 years, this was an unbelievable achievement in film history. Probably because it had a genius like George Miller behind it; creating the entire story solely out of storyboards alone. Which makes this film such a rich experience; it's as if I was watching a silent film at times. Every shot was completely stunning. Any time the movie took a breath, it was still so beautifully constructed that I could put the film on mute and still get an emotional response. Although I will say that the musical score was just as beautifully composed and added even more to the performances on screen. There is not a boring moment throughout any of the running time. There is not a dull character that comes into play. There is not a bad stunt or special effect thrown in during any of the action. It is as close to flawless as humanly possible. I will say that it was slightly sad not seeing Mel Gibson in the role anymore, but Tom Hardy nails everything about Max Rockatansky. That is the most negative comment I could say about the whole thing, and I don't even think that even comes close to counting as a knock against the movie, actually in a way is a compliment to a talented actor. He felt like the same character, but has naturally progressed into more of a primal being than before. For the first half of the film he doesn't even really speak, he grunts. This was awesome just to watch him sort of mumble and grunt to himself and some of the other characters. But I loved that the film still remembers the first ""Mad Max"", being haunted by the death of his family. It went into that territory just enough that it supplied me the character development for Max that felt satisfactory and justified the movie to remain as action packed without feeling as though there were no one worth routing. As much as this is Max's movie, it is equally Furiosa's too, played by Charlize Theron. Oh god she did fantastic in this; embodying exactly what Miller said to be, the ""Female Road Warrior"". In anyone else's hands, could have gone horribly wrong, but it doesn't. She is fierce while also heartbreaking. Furiosa deserves as much credit for making this film work as Max does, if not more so in some aspects. Lastly, I just want to go over the villain real quick. Entering the frame, it was as if seeing the next Darth Vader pop on screen. Immortan Joe holds such a presence that I thought I was gonna s**t my pants! So now that I have gone on and on about this movie, this is a must see for the summer. For the year. For the decade. A straight up ""must see"", period. I loved this movie. It's pretty obvious that most everyone who has seen this film loves it. I do not want this to be the next ""Dredd"" film. Or ""Edge of Tomorrow"" where it is an absolute great film that gets screwed in the box office and never gets another chance to expand its universe with a sequel. This is one of the greatest action films of all time right next to the first two Mad Max films in cinema history. Please go out and watch this. I am begging you, if I don't get a sequel to this then I am going to go on a killing rampage...I mean, I will be very sad. Seriously though, was fantastic and I hope to see more of Max's, and even Furiosa's, story in the future.",

Although the fourth screen appearance of Mad Max and the first without Mel Gibson, director George Miller, who helmed all four Mad Max movies, ups the action quotient this time out. As before, the plot is irrelevant, but serves as a vehicle for violent chases and clashes between a savage group who hold survivors of an apocalypse hostage for water and a small band of women fleeing sexual enslavement. Escaping his own imprisonment, Max joins the women, headed by the one-armed Furiosa, in their flight to a green area, where Furiosa grew up.",

Epic retooling of the cult classic MAD MAX films this time with Hardy (up to the challenge in replacing iconic Mel Gibson) as the anti-hero set in a never-ending post-apocalyptic Dystopian hell in no-man's land facing the evil Immortan Joe (Keays-Byrne, who was Toecutter in the original incarnation) while joining forces with Amazonian warrior Imperator Furiosa (Theron in full-touch with her inner Sigourney Weaver) a fierce rebel who has a gaggle of fabulous babes from Joe's harem-by-defacto in tow with a tanker of petrol too. Over-the-top mix of practical f/x and CGI wizardry guaranteed to drop jaws and make eyes agog (did I mention the Victoria's Secret models posse?) are the true stars of filmmaker George Miller's (who has directed, written and produced one helluva franchise) balls-out frenzied anything goes with a kitchen sink zealotry while the screenplay co-scripted with Brendan McCarthy & Nick Lathouris is more or less a retread of THE ROAD WARRIOR to the nth degree. Not a knock in this high-octane, muscle car of a sci-fi action thriller popcorn flick. Enjoy!",

800,15 May 2015,akash-am-mukherjee,10, A Landmark of Action Film Making,"Mad Max Fury Road is such a movie that leaves you spellbound and dumbstruck at the same time.. It keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film.. It maintains the harmony between mayhem and destruction so well that you end up finding it incomparable, unimaginable, unseen and exclusive.. George Miller has made more than just a masterpiece.. There would be no better replacement of Mel Gibson than Tom Hardy.. If I have to talk about charlize theron the first thing comes in my mind is her intensity.. She is way too brilliant in this movie.. She actually overshadows the rest.. Nicholas hoult as expected , phenomenal.. And the warlord played by the same guy from the first mad max movie , terrifying character... This movie has dozens of brutal action sequences you could hardy even imagine.. There's a scene, a guy shoots fire from an electric guitar, will blow your mind.. This movie is a landmark of action film making.. Calling it an outstanding film would be an understatement.. You don't wanna miss the best movie of 2015 and perhaps the best action movie of this decade...",
801,22 May 2015,superslayerps,4, Epic fail!! Almost..,"Caution spoiler alert!!! Headed down to see it first day I love Charlize Theron and Tom hardy and mad max.. All start with the good points. Good action,set design, costumes,hot rod type mad max cars and trucks welded and stacked together. I can't over state how great this movie looks. And the guitar player with the flame thrower on the front of the truck its amazing.. So it looked cool but it was like a Ferrari with a go cart motor.. I was immediately stuck by the lack of dialog and back story. There is very little talking/story.. I love action movies lots and lots of them.. but at least give me a reason to care about the people in the film. Just a couple minutes would be great but there's no story. Trucks drive go boom!! It's a one trick pony. Charlize made me care for her more then anyone but just in skill of acting not story.. It's all graphics which I love but nothing else. So turn of your brain off and you may like it. It seams like hype and not much more to me.. P.S. The artists that did the graphics are amazing in every way..",
802,20 May 2015,coreyjdenford,10," What a day, What a lovely day!","Mad Max: Fury may just be my new favourite film mainly because it has epic action battles along with explosions and a fantastic plot that really didn't match the previous films. This film only uses two special effects and they are for the dynamic weather in sand storms. Tom Hardy did a very good performance (again) but that wasn't performance, the best performance came from Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult and the fact that this film has strong women makes me like it even more because I just love when a woman can fight her own battles.

803,11 March 2016,joepmailbox-imdb,2, Give Me the Old Mel G. Max Movies,"Not really a spoiler. This Fury Road is so far over the top as to be no more than a circus of pyrotechnics and gymnastic stunts. You'll find no story here; any old silly plot line would do. Notice how the movie is cut off at 120 minutes exactly? It could have been 101 minutes or 137 minutes or some other number and not made any difference. Too bad. Good promo for a video game tho. P.S. Each review is to have at least 10 lines of text. This movies doesn't deserve ten-line review. that's too bad, as I mentioned. Mel Max had a reason to fight, that is, his wife and child were murdered by the local motorcycle gang. The movie is pitifully derivative, For example, the bad guy is a takeoff of Darth Vader. How original. The one good thing I saw was the location in Africa; that was wild with crazy table lands. Theron was terrific but in a meh role. Was she following the Hollywood trick of getting a big paycheck for a blockbuster and then doing a ""meaningful"" artsy movie? Again, too bad, because Mad Max: Fury Road is no blockbuster, just a bust.",
804,9 January 2016,Turfseer,5, Spectacularly choreographed action scenes and production design can't save script which features one big chase after another,"Australian writer/director George Miller, who gave us a trilogy of Mad Max dystopian thrillers from 1979 through 1985, is back with his new incarnation: ""Fury Road."" For those who love sci-fi and action blended together, ""Max"" should be your thing. Miller's post-apocalyptic world takes place out in the desert where a group of mutants are lorded over by one Immortan Joe, a king worshiped as a god by his subjects, who sports a mask that resembles a human skull. His warriors look like modern-day skinheads and there's also a grand coterie of Joe's subjects, akin to medieval peasants, Joe controls the water supply at his fortress called ""The Citadel"" and also owns a small harem of sex-slaves he maintains for breeding purposes (these women appear to be the only healthy ones in the realm).",
805,23 May 2015,gpreciat,6, It was so ridiculous that it was funny,"I am really amazed how many good reviews I am seeing on this site for this movie. Although I must admit it wasn't really bad, I would never called it good. A lot of people have pointed out, the photography, the music...all the technical things, and I must admit that indeed they are very well done. The main problem of this movie wasn't in that, it was in the casting and the plot. So the movie begins, and as almost it begins the action too, which as all of the people who watched, I too love my action, but in giving the ""action"" the audience wanted I understood nothing about the plot, because it was never developed. I never got what were those white humans, why were they white, and why did they capture people for the blood, and I must admit I have never watched Mel Gibson's movie or read the comics (I heard there were comics about it), but a movie shouldn't need the help of other mediums, specially when its not a sequel. So I didn't either understand why the wives were so important. The second problem was the casting, Charlize Theron stole the whole movie. Between the supposedly main character Max and the wives, it was like I was seeing a high school play instead of a movie, and as I said Charlize Theron didn't help matters by showing the great actress she is. The third thing that was an issue or maybe not was the ridiculousness of everything, starting with the guitarist playing the guitar while thousands of people were dying around him, every time I saw him, I laugh my head off. Then you have the medical stuff, the blood transfusion while not even caring the type of blood of the donor. And look, I do not have a problem with a little fantasy in my movies, but in a world that was stated that it came from ours, it was unbelievable. Then the funniest thing were the people flying on the poles (I loved the acrobatics) And I'm sure the movie wasn't supposed to be a comedy, but it ended up being that. Anyhow at the end of it, I suppose it was entertaining, even with its faults.",
806,27 May 2015,asb_deutsch,9," Surprisingly, not BO #1!","It has been nearly 2 weeks since I saw Fury Road, and I'm still trying to recover. It is the sort of film you forget to breathe through, much like Interstellar, but for an altogether different reason. Unrelenting from beginning to end, this post-apocalyptic saga is virtually one, long, explosive chase sequence, albeit one which seemingly has new ideas on tap. The action (i.e. the whole film) is utterly bonkers, conceptually and in execution. That writer-director George Miller and his team concocted such ferocious set pieces is impressive enough, but being able to pull it off with extraordinarily daring stunt work – augmented by gritty CGI – is simply awe-inspiring. Visually it is vivid and spectacular; the searing desert landscape offering a dirt-filled grime so tangible your throat will dry up within seconds, whilst the vehicles are creative and wonderfully preposterous. The heart-pounding score by Junkie XL, in which he blends orchestral and heavy metal music, accompanies Miller's on screen splendour to create a visceral experience for both the eyes and the ears. The vehicular carnage may be the drawcard, but the committed cast elevate the overall product. Tom Hardy is savage as Max, Charlize Theron is compelling as Imperator Furiosa and Nicholas Hoult (Remember, X-Men???) is gonzo as Nux, whilst a plethora of recognisable Aussies show up in deranged cameos. There's an intensity here you just don't find in majority of the big- budgeted blockbusters; an inventiveness in all elements that drives this movie from great to mesmerizing. Miller hasn't played in the Mad Max world since the dreadful Beyond Thunderdome back in 1985, but by God he has redeemed himself, and then some. Fury Road is a rollicking ride that carves out a piece of cinematic history all for itself. Considering the wave of terrible 90's Sci-fi sequels/remakes we've had fired our way in the past few years (Terminator Salvation, RoboCop, Total Recall etc.) Fury Road's success has been more than a pleasant surprise. In short it is a grungy masterpiece.",

Guys i wouldn't watch it again if they pay me a million bucks. I don't know why am I rating it 2. It should be -200 but I don't want people to lose faith in Hollywood. Gangsters with funny cars, funny getup and funny acting, 200 psychos chasing one woman for nothing in the whole movie, I admit it has fast action but action without story looked simply stupid.

Unless you enjoy very long car chases with no story, this is not for you. This mindless action flick is barely entertaining and didn't even seem like a mad max film. I like action films, but this was so repetitive and ridiculous(made me laugh at times because of this). I didn't care about any of the characters because we don't know anything about them. The whole premise got me as well, what happened to gas being precious and valuable. They seem to have unlimited gas throughout the movie, never needing to fill up.

815,20 May 2015,oscaralbert,8," MAD MAX: FURY ROAD defines the movie genre called ""eye candy"" . . .",". . . as its events take place in an alternate reality located on an unnamed planet in an island of time unconnected to any we know. This Parallel Universe seems to have a few things in common with Life As We Know It, such as men, women, and gasoline-powered vehicles. But the Laws of Physics discovered by people such as Newton and Einstein do not apply here. Nor do the Economic Principles of Malthus, or any precepts of the Natural Sciences as taught in America's public schools. (Maybe they dove-tail somewhat with Creationism and Global Warming Deniers--I wouldn't know about that.) In MAD MAX, children are only seen in nightmares, but non-pregnant women are ""milked"" by machines for so many gallons that milk baths are the preferred way to clean up. This planet's gravity is such that 100-ton trucks seem to get about 500 miles per gallon of gas. Though the landscape has less vegetation than any desert on Earth, the common folks appear to be well-fed (but are told they do NOT need any water to survive.) For entertainment, artificial waterfalls are allowed to soak into the parched landscape at the drop of a hat. The original MAD MAX trilogy made some attempt to maintain an internal logic connected to our world. This remake simply tries hard to be over the top, all the time. Some people fancy themselves to be visually oriented--this film is for them. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is ""Beyond the Thinkingdome"" for everyone else.",

It's filled with complex characters, each with its own problems and purpose who ultimately end up fighting for their lives. The scenes look great, the action is intense, generating plenty of drama and suspense, while bringing something new from time to time just to spice things up and keep the story interesting.

The Road Warrior is my personal favorite of the three, with great characters, story and action. And yet, despite how much I like it, it is not even CLOSE to beating out this movie in terms of quality. I'll actually go as far as to call it a milestone for action-movies as a genre. Way too often recently, the action movies feature poorly written heroes, villains and action set pieces, so it was fantastic beyond words to see this masterpiece. The cinematography in this movie is honestly some of the best I've seen all my life. The vastness of the sands and cliffs combined with the blue sky make for some of the most gorgeous shots in any action-movie. The action itself was also mindblowing, with long, wide takes and a fantastic sense of grittiness and realism to every set-piece. The movie also sports great characters with great emotions, backed up by great performances, as well as some top tier worldbuilding. I could honestly talk about how much I love this movie all day, it's so good. It's a miracle in today's world of cheap, boring, badly directed action, and I will continue loving it until the day I die.",

Starting off, being a die hard Mad Max fan from the early days I went into this movie ready to fall in love (even though Eve Ensler consulted on and changed a lot of the movie). All of Mad Maxs' traits, which made him the bad-ass I loved, were in fact given to Furiosa.

This time Tom Hardy lands the role speaking less likely less than a paragraph of words. In a futuristic desert wasteland Max is captured and used as a blood bag until he makes a failed escape attempt. Hardy handles the action spending much time chained to the front of a battle rig that tears about the desert. Charlize Theron plays Furiosa who has one mechanical arm. She is driving a rig to fetch oil for the evil Immortal Joe who holds water against those in need. Furiosa is sent for gasoline but she secretly shelters fertile woman owned by Joe. When it is discovered that these women are missing, a chase is on for the betrayal of Furiosa. She is eventually aided by the resourceful Max. Nicholas Hoult steals scenes in a manic performance as Nux who seeks favour with Immortal Joe until he sees the error in Joe's vision and decides to help Max and Furiosa. Hoult is bald and completely concealed in white makeup for a ghostly affect. Hugh Keays-Byrne plays the tyrant Immortal Joe who deceives his people into believing he is everlasting. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a surprise performance playing the Splendid Angharad who is carrying Joe's baby but she refuses to reform to his ruling. Director George Miller returns giving fans the action and effects that mirror the previous films thus allowing Fury Road to journey with nostalgia for those fans of yesterday. Score: 10 / 10",

It did justice to the first three films, while at the same time managing to add enough new elements to the mix to justify its own existence -- no small achievement! Tom Hardy didn't bring quite the same gravitas to the role as Mel Gibson did, and I would have preferred to see the aging actor in the role, which I think could have made it more moving when Max is suffering nightmarish visions of his dead wife and child -- that's the trouble with a reboot that doesn't ignore the previous films, in squaring away the new cast with what has gone before. But, all things considered, it didn't disappoint, and I suspect it's one that might be even better second time round, when there's a chance to take in more of the secondary characters and the visuals. 8/10.",

Never do we see a film that treats this genre with respect and is willing to take risks.

You might enjoy this IF and only IF you truly love car chases, otherwise it's a real stinker. No story. No character development. No logic. Only lots and lots of chasing cars. Fury Road is just a long meaningless chase toped with plenty of stupid action scenes. Although I do admit that the CGIs are great, and you gotta love the never-sleep-crazy- guitar-guy. And Charlize is as beautiful and excellent as usual. But a two hour movie really needs some kind of a interesting story. Mad Max, Fury Road lacks any kind of story.

These films come very rare, sometime once in a decade. It is even more rare to actually see I remake which is directed by the same director from the original movie and it is total rarity if the new version is better then the original. This is precisely what we get with this years most action charged remake of ""Mad Max: Fury Road"", an absolutely marvelous attempt by director George Miller to revitalize this cult 80's classic. The original trilogy set Mel Gibson on to the Hollywood stardom and who knows this film might take Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy to the next level as well. ",
848,15 May 2015,lucassg0123,9, Instant Classic.,"Definitely my favorite action movie so far. It is a simple plot, but with the amazing Mad Max's pos apocalyptic world to backup, which adds up to the history. The action scenes(whole movie)is amazing. I thought it would get dull to see always the same type of scenes, which were cars exploding. But it was so well organized and beautiful that you can only get amazed by then, never tired. The cars were crazy and awesome. The movie brings finally a great female character, which many do not try. Actually this brings me to my final point, and the only point I did not like. Mad Max(Tom Hardy) was definitely overshadowed by Furiosa(Charlize Theron). I am a big fan of Tom Hardy and I think that he was perfect for the character. Although I think that he did not give his best in this job, there was a lack of ""madness"" on him. I cannot blame only him for this, as it was impossible not to be overshadowed by Charlize Theron there. To sum up, the movie is an instant classic action movie, with amazing but a simple plot and great supporting actors and actress. I had to hold my self not to applaud the movie at the end and look stupid.",

This is not even mentioning Max, or that the allies Max, Furiosa, and the brides encounter who propel the third act are old women armed with army rifles and bags of seeds. ""That,"" says Max, pointing at a naked woman suspended in an open enclosure up in the air, weeping for help, ""is bait."" He gets it. Women are not kittens stuck in trees.

At first I thought this was an instance of over-hyping the movie but then I realized, thats not it. I was excited to see ""Mad Max"" and instead what I got was ""Mad Furiosa"" Now before you assume that this is one of those anti-feminism reviews, I assure you it is quite the opposite. I genuinely enjoyed the film, and Furiosa's role as a strong independent female lead. Had the movie been entitled ""Furiosa"" or simply ""Fury road"" I would have given it 10/10 stars. Unfortunately however it was titled ""Mad Max"" tricking fans into seeing a movie that hardly featured the so called hero of the story, (I refuse to call him the main character at this point). On the note of sexism and sexist notions for which the movie is under fire, I will say that i was slightly offended at the theme throughout the movie of ""All men are evil except a few of them who are forced into being good and all women should not trust them"" If you can't see that in the film then you are really trying to avoid it. That is not however, in my reasoning towards the low rating as i said before the producers of this film lied to me about what it was. I hope if there is a sequel, that it will actually feature the road warrior as promised.

Even little crony bad guys put up decent fights. Even one or two of the super model ladies pull a couple ones. Watching this movie in 3D just amplifies all this action, and the color choices just really brought out the Gothic post apocalyptic setting.

FURY ROAD didn't care; it gave me all the information a newbie like me needs to get caught up and enjoy the craziness. Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) is a loner, drifting through the post-apocalyptic wasteland, apparently trying to avoid getting caught up in all the end-of-the-world lunacy since he's had a few too many close acquaintances die on his watch. It's ruined within moments of the film's opening when he's chased down and captured by a party of War Boys from the nearby Citadel, a desert oasis set inside a massive rock formation that's ruled through cruelty by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne).

With that in mind it was good to see that this movie was NOT a reboot, but a sort of follow on, and while i thought it was an OK movie it should have been just that... an OK movie under a new name as it was nothing like the originals... Yes there were links like it was set in post apocalyptic Australia and yes max didn't speak much... but seriously??? . Instead we have the brand name that rely's on the older generation telling the young ones how great the originals were.. Classics, cult movies. And so we get this tripe using the name of mad max to sell an action film that could just as well be called ' THE DESERT ROAD OF DEATH' and should have. Its just my opinion but as an avid fan i thought mad max 3 sold out to Hollywood and pushed it a bit... but this is a disgrace to the franchise! as an action film its OK, 6/10, nothing I've not seen before, but trying to fill such big boots makes it a dying shame and i hope they stop here. Rename this move to have nothing to do with mad max, just happens to have a star called max and it would work a lot better. You cant just tell this story because the younger generation wont know the story and wont watch the originals because they are not full of modern effects, cgi and so on and the older generation will see that Tom Hardy as good an actor as he is does not get the character right.

It's full of action, right from the beginning to the end and the stunts were amazing. Personally, I think the movie should have been called Mad Furiosa because Max hardly said a word through the whole film. Anyway, in this movie you see Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) being captured by a group of rebels who keep him in a dungeon as there prisoner. When Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is told to pick up some gasoline for the rebels, she takes his five pregnant wives with her because they want to escape from the ruthless warlord, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Whilst travelling across the dangerous wasteland, Joe soon realises that his wives have escaped, so he gathers his various gang's together, so he can get them back. Max also travels with the rebels and he manages to escape from them and ends up helping Furiosa on her impossible mission. The storyline was great and the intensity throughout the movie, kept me on the edge of my seat. Charlize Theron's performance was outstanding and the whole look of the movie was brilliant. It does end quite abruptly so I hope they come out with a sequel soon. I'm waiting to see Mad Max kick butt because there wasn't that much depth to his character. That's not to say that Tom Hardy didn't play his part well but there was just way to much going on for the director to go into his story. Hopefully he will do in the sequel! Anyway, it's definitely one of the best films that I have watched this year and for a remake, it makes the original look mediocre. Brilliant!",

942,13 June 2015,starfoxfan86,10, an epic modern masterpiece,"What are action movies today? They are a sea of CG, PG-13s just for the label, Marvel super heroes, and Michael Bay jokes. But every so often there is something like this. and while this is an existing franchise this moves shows us what a modern action movie should be. One of the draws of the original Mad Max trilogy is the real stuntwork during the action scenes. There really is something special about watching an actual stunt and knowing it was done for real. Mad Max Fury Road actually is real stuntwork like it's predecessors- but not only that it is far more ambitious in every action scene. Just about every move someone makes or a crash during an action scene here really is a spectacle. The theatrical trailer is just a small taste of what happens. And I estimate that 50-75% of this movie is pure action- yet it somehow doesn't grow old. But this is not a CG free film. However CG was only used to remove stuff like rigging and wires- which makes the action even more spectacular. Another spectacle this movie has to offer is the production design. Just looking at the vehicles and how most of them are pieces of different vehicles is just incredible- and they all were real. And at last there's the story. This movie sort of is a remake of the original Mad Max and The Road Warrior but at the same time is it's own original film. Not only that but there's the aspect of the characters- and despite the massive amounts of action, every major character is completely developed, and even the supporting cast is very memorable for different reasons. In actuality the story keeps the action from getting old and the two parts actually are almost the same thing. This movie is almost a month old at the time I'm writing this review and this is one of my top 10 favorite movies. This may not be the case for most people, but the use of action as visual storytelling really left an impression on me and I wish more action movies will follow in its footsteps. It really is impressive that 30 years after the last Mad Max movie and after 14 years of delay that George Miller brought back his signature series with a completely new vision. I look forward to the sequels that come. This is a really simple summary and it does not do the movie the justice it deserves. Mad Max Fury Road is a movie that cannot be summarized in words. It can only be experienced.",

Action in this movie is so great, that you sometimes can't register all that's happening on screen. Tom Hardy is a great replacement for Mel Gibson and Charlize Teron is great and deserves her share of praise too. In fact, far more than her ""Atomic Blonde"" 2 years later. Miller knows what he's doing and there is something passionistic in this movie. The whole idea which carries through the series of Max roaming the wasteland like some sort of a limbo, looking for redemption and hope. This is how you make a GOOD action movie. Everything is in it's place and you care for the characters. And the action will give you wet dreams. I give it 10/10 and I'm not exaggerating. It deserves it.

Gasoline and water are apparently very valuable, but we see no character treating them like scarce commodities. There's not a whole lot of dialogue to establish what's going through the minds of these underdeveloped characters in a fictional world, but here goes a shot: At some point during a scuffle within a scuffle, Hardy and Theron team up to help the five wives of cult leader Keays-Byrne flee his wretched wasteland (no, they don't bother with trying to save any of the children or old people we saw for some reason, just five beautiful women). However, it is commendable for using CGI sparingly. Director Miller intended to make the film feel like one continuous chase, and his accomplishment is at the price of establishing interesting characters; not to mention that it's impractical for the audience to be pumped the entire time—a roller-coaster has to go up and down. The flame-shooting guitarist was undeniably savage though. There ends up being too many unintentional callbacks to Hardy's performance in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES: a mask covering the nose and mouth, blood transfusion tubing, the weakness of hope, use of a sawed-off shotgun, etc. Ultimately a fun nightmarish ride worth time and money, despite its obvious flaws.",

The message? We screwed the world, clean water should be shared with the people and pretty girls should be set free from ugly man with boils. Rich and operatic in sight, sound and action. This new version is a substantial step up from the original to more than satisfy today's jaded audience who crave for X-rated heavy metal excitements. I was absolutely stoked from the beginning to the end. In terms of sizzling the characters with flesh, blood and souls, of note are Nicholas Hoult and Charlize Theron because they put so much juice and bounce into whom they played and make their characters tough and vulnerable all at once. Nux is a war boy played by Hoult who switched side and went out on his own prophecy of dying historic and heroic (sic) on a fury road. It was a real sad moment to see him go. As for Charlize's character, the Imperator Furiosa. With a name that sounds like a newly discovered species of carnivorous flower, she too almost went out but story dictates she needs to return to take the helm so Max saved her. And what about Max (Tom Hardy) you may ask? Well, he is as good as any Max can be and that is plenty more than you can ever ask for.",
964,26 May 2015,wolfrahms,10, Furious passion,"Forget about story arc. Mad Max: Fury Road is an unpredictable thrill ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. The protagonist Max stays in the background so that the secondary characters (who are not critical to a sequel) have screen time to be humanized before some of them are killed in an orgy of clever and inventive brutality. The refreshing lack of humor is made up for by a handful of personalities whose agendas are evident and therefore interesting. Although it is violent, the passion put into every scene shines through the bleakness. It feels authentic as dystopian fiction. The themes of despair and hopelessness are presented convincingly with the help of amazing settings, props and cinematography. I don't have any real complaints apart from Max being perhaps a bit too hard to relate to. Overall, here is a movie that has realized its potential. Watch in 3D.",

I don't think my opinion about any of the parts has changed, but my relative weighting of their importance has shifted. I'll say right up front, I don't think this is a bad film. A lot of it is more than a little exceptional. The action scenes, especially the final chase, are incredible. It's pretty much everything else about it that I could do without. The story and characters are pretty dumb. That's not a new thing ... it's pretty much true of all the films in this series, and it's what really buries the 3rd one. But in past films, none of the bad elements are amped up to absurd levels through the use of excessive CGI and a ridiculously frenetic pace. If you consider ""The Road Warrior"", that film's grounding in a very real seeming physicality gives it's broad sketchy characters the aura of archetypes. It's like a post apocalyptic western. This film feels like a cartoon, or maybe a video game. A really really good one, but still ... a video game.",

The storyline was so vaguely explained throughout the film, and left just enough room for your own interpretation of it. They made the action sequences with a finesse, and connected you to all characters during the whole film, even during massive fight scenes. Tom Hardy was brilliant as always, I did not think that he would be able to pull off this type of movie, but as he has proved in past movies, he can!

There is no doubt that above all other options, the audience should be entertained; but to what extent is it worth to provide absurd entertainment aimlessly and without any story? ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is as frivolous as 1920's ""Slapstick"" comedies; except that these comedies are assessed justifiable as they have been made at the emergence of cinema. However, such idiot-ism that hitting and banging the whole 2 hours is strange in 2015. ""Mad Max"" is story-less and there is no plan to involve the audience in events by drama. Too amateur illustrations that are tried to seem professional and rigorous! So what is the role of mis-en-scene? On what basis has it been arranged that do not help the story promote? ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" does not have necessary standards for being a movie at all; and this is the outcome of ""Cinephilia"" attitude that grabs ""Cine- academia"" aspects of the movie and presents inane scenes. Scenes that stems in illiteracy of the movie maker. The movie characters are infirm and unproductive. When a newcomer who has not meet previous versions of ""Mad Max"" watch this one, asks who is ""Max""?, Why does not he talk in order to help the back-story enhance the narration? Who is the ""Bad Man"" of the movie? What has changed him into such a blood-thirsty monster? What is the purpose of the story? What is the relationship between ""Water poverty"" and the movie narration? And more important: Has George Miller thought of anything other than burning, shooting and Rock music? ""Cinema"" is a medium to ""state"" through scenes. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" may gross a lot and receive many awards, but it is a pre-movie and a disaster and if it is placed in 10-best-movies list of many critics is because of the discreet charm of ""Cinephilia"".",

Feriosa apparently betrays him and takes his girls with her to an unknown destination, he chases after her with his gang to claim them back(gang includes a vehicle solely for the rock artist playing a flame guitar for no apparent reason). After hours of endless driving and shooting, Feriosa, Max and the girls manage to escape only to pick up some old women and return back to exactly where they left. Dialogue is weak, Characters are poor, I couldn't even tell what the role of Max was in the movie. In summary, the movie is basically two hours of mediocre car chase and senseless shooting.

It stands out among the rest because of its complex and twisted world building, strong and compelling heroines, stunning visual effects and action scenes and most especially, it's unique and moving story. This film literally has the most dangerous and explosive car chase I've ever seen in any film, and I saw the whole Fast & Furious film franchise. George Miller is indeed a genius, to create such a twistedly beautiful story of survival and to actually sell it is not easy. I am very impressed with the world building, the details, the whole atmosphere and feel of it got stuck on me. I imagined I would not last in that dry and disease infested world where everyone has to fight for food and water. Max (Tom Hardy) and Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) are two compelling characters that clearly have different agendas, caught in a brutal world they are forced to be on, but because of a common enemy, undecidedly became the strongest of allies. Watching these two heroines exchange guns and the steering wheel is nothing but exciting and thrilling. Everything about Mad Max: Fury Road is mind-blowing, an edge-of-your-seat experience that doesn't flood you with too much script. This film is all about the goods.

George Miller is back in the director's chair here and gives us a true sequel to ""The Road Warrior"" that every film fan has been waiting for with baited breath. In Fury Road, the world has become a mere shadow of itself as the warlord, Immortan Joe, rules the wastelands with an iron fist. Charlize Theron's superb female hero, Imperator Furiosa, acts as the impetus that sets the plot in motion by stealing Immortan Joe's precious wives. Mad Max Rockatansky, played brilliantly by the viciously talented Tom Hardy, gets caught up in this chaotic maelstrom that seamlessly plays out as one long chase scene across endless stretches of desert. The action is relentless, heart- pounding, and beautifully shot but, when pealing back the layers of this unhinged action masterpiece, a powerful underlying message can be found that challenges the sometimes despicable lens through which women are viewed in society. George Miller, with minimal dialog, still manages to draw us to each character and their plights. He reminds me of the great Sergio Leone In that both have directed few but critically acclaimed films, both directors revived a seemingly dead genre, and each of their magnum opuses feature a character who relies on facial expression instead of words to convey emotion. The structure of the film and its stellar execution leave very little room for problems but there is still enough room for a few to squeeze through. The minor nit-picks I have with this film only include some stilted dialog and not enough Max in a ""Mad Max"" film. One thing that may deter the general moviegoer from seeing MMFR is the over-the-top kookiness interspersed throughout the film. This wasn't a problem for me but I can definitely understand how certain people could be turned off by that.

There's not much of a plot, essentially just an extended version of the Road Warrior final chase sequence. For sure it's spectacular, amazing practical effects, unbelievable stunt work, mind bending vehicles, there's even a gimp playing a flame throwing guitar. What's not to love about that?

I'm a curmudgeon when it comes to action and sci fi movies. In my view, stunt work is much less impressive when half or more of it is accomplished via green-screen and rendered human beings. Science Fiction relies on visual stimulus and often massive destruction effects (miniatures, matte painting, and stop motion) to add to the constructed universe and entertainment factor, now diluted so much by the knowledge that rooms full of outsourced nerds in Canada, India, New Zealand and China are clicking pixels around until everything is absolutely ""perfect"".

1006,26 May 2015,Likes_Ninjas90,6," Fury Road is all technique but sometimes you want more or in this case, maybe less","George Miller didn't invent the post-apocalyptic subgenre. He refurnished it with the 1979 Mad Max, a low-budget piece of Australian exploitation cinema. Two sequels followed, The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunder Dome, given the success and popularity of these films in Hollywood. Yet in cinema the apocalyptic genre predates Miller, tracing back as far the 1950s, if not earlier. One of the most famous examples of the post-apocalyptic genre would be Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal (1957), which is about a knight who returns from the Crusades and faced a plague riddled medieval village. Similarly, the Japanese wastelands in Akira Kurosawa's samurai epic Throne of Blood (1957) visualise a dust laden, smoky aesthetic, which is fitting for a film made after the nuclear warfare of the Second World War. These are apocalyptic movies, Biblical in scale and tone, and along with the Western genre they undoubtedly influenced the Mad Max series. The character of Max was originally played by Mel Gibson, who himself has made numerous films about righteous vengeance. Set in a future Australian wasteland of scarce oil resources and rickety land vehicles, Max was a cop out for revenge against the men who murdered his family. He's been compared to knights, samurai, cowboys and Ronins as he travels the wasteland for work and defending villages.",

Making a subsequent film, without Mel Gibson, 40+ years later was a gamble for George Miller. It is not The Road Warrior but it is good. Tom Hardy is good as Max, but, oddly a second player to Charlize Theron's lead character. She is bold and good as the female leader rescuing the wives of the central cult like villain. She is clearly the 21st Century, female embodiment of the original Max-this is evidenced by her early mimic of The Road Warrior dialogue. Much of this post apocalyptic wasteland is familiar and brutal. The madness, violence, scarcity, and perversity are all out of Miller's universe. The cinematography is spotty at times, and too frenetic for my taste. The vehicular chases and related effects are stunning. The theme of female empowerment is great. Worth the roller coaster ride.",

Needless to say, made me watch the previous trilogy, nonetheless. I must say, George Miller has shown what he's capable of. Loved ""Happy Feet"" duologue and then THIS!. Couldn't get any better.",

The film unleashes a devastating force and arrogance in all its directorial and scenographic choices starting from the punk and cyberpunk taste of the costumes, to arrive at the meticulous quality of the never banal chase scenes and furious fights aboard whimsical and eccentric cars. In the face of the fact that this ""action package"" occupies most of the vision after all, and therefore it would have been easy to fall into repetitiveness. These are undoubtedly positive elements, which fill in all respects the semblance of emptiness (desired and not at all dystopian) in the deepening of the plot of the characters, and in particular of the protagonist. These latter criticisms of the film are understandable, but nevertheless they do not in any way undermine the audiovisual experience, which is decidedly of another level compared to modern action cinema.",

1019,4 May 2022,humzahladiwala,10, Pure Artistry from the mind of Mr. George Miller,"Mad Max: Fury Road is the fifth movie about the iconic 80's road warrior, Max Rockatansky, and serves as a sequel/soft reboot of the franchise. George Miller us once again at the helm of this film, and the man behind the Mad Max franchise and Happy Feet proves his sheer genius with this technical tour de force. The film was stranded in development hell for years, but you would never know it from the way it looks and sounds. The non-stop car chase just goes 100 miles an hour but when it does hit the breaks, it's done in an unobtrusive manner that only supports the action sequences. Speaking of which, the action sequences are beautiful. Gorgeous cinematography coupled with raw, uncompromising violence gives the film the special quality of being unable to look away from it. The fights are remarkably intelligent, and they tell you much about the characters without words. This film also uses a lack of dialogue very effectively, with the actors going all in with facial expressions, grunts, and gestures. The always excellent Tom Hardy delivers an impressive nonverbal performance, with his take on Max being one of stone cold efficiency to achieve his goals. Charlize Theron disappears into the role of Imperator Furiosa, with a performance that is raw and emotionally charged and compliments Hardy beautifully despite the differences the two had on set. Nicholas Hoult is phenomenal in the role of Nux, nailing his delivery and mannerisms to a T and it works very nicely. Nux is probably the heart of the movie, and Hoult more the rises to the occasion. The movie has one thing that I disliked, and that would be it's plot. It's plot seems a little lazy at times, which is all the more noticeable when you compare it to how much effort that the cast and crew put into the movie. Any shortcomings the plot has, however, are swallowed up by the incredible shots and action. Overall, this film is a must watch for action fans and the closest thing to perfection one could hope to see onscreen.",
1020,22 May 2015,thomas-lavoie,10, Greatest movie of all time! A monstrous film that'll change cinema forever!,"I've always liked Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior and would often recommend it to friends, but Mad Max: Fury Road (the fourth movie of the series) made me extraordinarily satisfied to a supreme and fanatical level, satisfaction beyond belief, like no other moment in my life. It is hands down a nuclear bomb in the world of cinema even if you have never seen any of the last three Mad Max movies. George Miller will surely be remembered as a giant of the movie industry because of this. Every single person walking out of the cinema could be heard praising the movie as a masterpiece, similarly to people's reaction to the Star Wars movies back in the days. This was on a level of epicness that can barely be described. The vast majority of people told me they were physically tired after seeing this movie because they burnt all their energy trying to mentally capture and remember every-single moment of the movie. The characters were amazing, the level of detail was mind blowing, the Mad Max universe stimulated me, the quality of the shots were perfect, the stunts were gigantic and impressive beyond imagination and the amount of stunts was insane. The whole movie is almost one non-stop adrenaline rush of beautiful shots. I didn't know it was even possible to make a movie on this level.",
1021,21 July 2015,sharky_55,8," You will ride eternal, shiny and chrome","""My name is Max,"" trembles the opening scene of Fury Road, and that is about as much exposition as you will get. A few sound bites hinting at a nuclear wasteland and a harsh voice-over establishing the persona of the title character tell us plenty. Yet the film could even do without those; the two headed lizard that Max chews hints at both these without being too overt and there is subtext without need for a immediate answer in the ghostly whispers of Max's deceased daughter and wife. George Miller's post apocalyptic world is immediately engaging with barely any expository dialogue or explanation. It's a film buzzing with strong imagery, mythology and mood that elevates it beyond pure action. ",

It had many difficulties including being stuck in development hell for years, filming being repeatedly delayed, and difficulties in securing locations to shoot the film. Miller had plans to do the film as far back as 2003 with Gibson intended to reprise his role but took a further 10 years before tuition.

1030,26 May 2015,mariuskleppe,10, The best action-film in a long time!,"The movie starts of with a voice-over, and 15 seconds in to the movie, the action has already started! We quickly get introduced to the main- characters, and then the story starts. This whole movie is simply put a 2hour-long chase-sequence with real stunts, chaotic, but easy to follow explosions and fight-sequences (unlike the mess in Michael Bays Transformers movies...). This movie works so good, mostly because of George Millers vision. He's got such a great control over the action and the universe. Miller is the star of this movie, even though he doesn't appear on-screen (that I noticed.). When I walked in to this movie, I was a bit afraid that two hours of this would get boring after a while, but I guarantee you that it doesn't! The universe this takes place in, is really interesting, and the thing this movie does right, is that it doesn't tell you everything. It doesn't explain every single little detail about everything, considering the fact that it's probably less than 100 lines of dialog in the movie. It's visual storytelling, so the universe is as complex as you make it yourself. You can see this movie for the action alone, but there is a lot of interesting elements besides the action, even if it's only sort of hinted at. The great thing about the action, is that very much of it is done with practical effects and real people. This makes the movie feel more authentic, and it's a nice break from the cgi-heavy superhero-movies of today, even though there is some cgi, it's never too much. You feel the speed and the action, and instead of slow-motion, this movie use quite a bit of speed-up footage, which adds to the insanity of the movie. The movie is visually really stunning, and I especially liked the feel of the nighttime scenes (which were actually shot at day, but touched on in post-production.) It's visual beauty. The characters are also very interesting. Mad Max himself, is pretty much Mad Max as we know him (even though Tom Hardy has taken over for Gibson). Theron plays Furiosa, which is a female protagonist right up there with Ripley and Sarah Connor. Personally I think I found Hoults character Nux, the most interesting. I won't spoil anything, but he's great. The villain, called Immortan Joe, is a classic Mad Max villain, especially considering he's played by the same man who played Toecutter in the original Mad Max. His presence makes the movie even better. Overall I will say that Mad Max: Fury Road is hopefully a future classic, on par with MM2: The Road Warrior, and other action-movies like Die Hard and Terminator 2. It sure as hell deserves it. This movie is like an awesome roller-coaster. You're in for a ride that will shake you around for two hours, and when it let's go, you will, if you're anything like me, want to get right back on for a second spin! It's insane, and makes the Fast & Furious movies look like they're meant for kids (and I like those movies too.). This is just so much more thrilling. The plot may be a tad too simplistic, but that didn't bother me, because the action weighs up for it. If the Taken sequels had action-scenes like this, I wouldn't complain one second for the lack of an original plot! This movie is just so inspired, and feels so fresh. I can't really explain it with words, you just have to see it for yourself. Chances are, you'll either love, or hate it. It all depends on your taste in cinema, but it sure as hell fits me perfectly. I will also say that it's a movie that is meant for the big-screen, so don't download this on your computer or watch it on a small, bad TV. If you can catch it in the theaters, than do so! The visuals, and the soundtrack is best enjoyed on a large scale. (The soundtrack is awesome btw. And sort of played by the people in the movie, I guess you've seen the guitar-player in the trailer!). Watch it in theatres now!",

For the rest of you guys who love pure action, crazy crashes, amazing FX and unbelievable stunts: don't worry, Mad Max has got all of it too. And it rocks.

The budget for this movie had to be insane because the cost to make all these vehicles and explosions and crashes had to be astronomical! And so worth every penny. This movie is enrapturing and stunning! Mad Max: Fury Road personifies madness from the frantic camerawork to the editing style to Tom Hardy's wild-eyed performance making this film intense, heart-pounding, and unpredictable.

Now, I was never that into the original films (I can't even remember whether there's two or three of them!) so perhaps I'm more forgiving and not exactly a 'Mad Max' purist, however, perhaps one of the reasons this new version is so well received is that it's written and directed by the original's director, George Miller.",

George Miller is back with Mad Max after Beyond The Thunder Dome which was 30 years ago. Directors who usually return to a franchise who started it don't end up really good. Some examples are George Lucas for Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Or Steven Spielberg for Indiana Jones 4. But George Miller proves that he can bring a franchise back to life. This is probably one of the best action films of the summer so far. Tom Hardy as Max did a fine job but Charlize Theron as Furiosa is amazing. Her character kicked some major ass. The story was also great and it was very simple. It's just getting from point A to point B. The action was amazing and there wasn't any of that shaky cam. George Miller's direction is amazing because he uses some wide shots which looks amazing. The movie is also very intense I also felt hot while I was watching this movie because it takes place in a desert like area. I really loved how much of the action was done practical because today action films do CGI for tough shots but in this film it was all done with practical effects which made it feel real. This film isn't for everyone. The film is very weird and crazy which most people can't take. If your a Mad Max fan you'll enjoy the hell out of this film. Mad Max Fury Road is one of the best films this summer and one of my favorite films this year.

I felt emotions with Furiosa and the girls at times, but from the beginning it left a foul taste in my mouth when we see Max eat a lizard. How ridiculous was that. Lizard skins are way to tough to chew and even if Max had a beer, he would still choke. I quickly dismissed that scene as to not let it affect my overall judgement, but there was so much more unrealistic crap that it was hard to really love it.

CGI is definitely used as little as possible while stunts and special effects are put forward in this slice of madness tainted of nightmarish visions inspired by paintings of Dali and Goya. The colors, sounds, costumes design and characters development are amazing and the film turns out to be something completely unique, a savvy mix of action, adventure and visual madness. Probably the only film after El Topo that has had such an impact on me. Huge fan of the original trilogy, this film manages to respect the old style but pumps up the adrenaline and push the pedal full throttle into 21st century. What surprised me was the fact that mastermind George Miller, now in his 70's has managed to direct a film of an incredible modernity while younger directors today are incapable of doing something as fresh or as original as this film. Clearly a modern masterpiece filled with so much depth and visual elements referencing; the stolen generation, the gender issue, themes of slavery , servitude, redemption and human greed. Shot like a huge chase across the gorgeously photographed Namibian desert, the cinematography from John Seale, who came out of retirement especially for this film, is beyond anything I have ever seen. Every shot is filled with so much elements, so rich of details, I think I just took the biggest slap of my life at the movies. I highly encourage the audience to watch it in IMAX 3D because this film seems to have been invented especially for this technology... I assure you, films like this come only once in a lifetime and I feel blessed to witness the rebirth of the lone 'Samurai' and anti hero Mad Max Rockatansky. One little regret, Mel Gibson would have been a better choice than Tom Hardy who does an OK job but lacks the charisma and the natural flashing madness so unique and perceptible in the eyes of mister Gibson. Thankfully Charlyze Theron is impressive with her shaved head and mechanical arm, inhabited by a rare determination and burning the screen with her raw intensity, she will surprises a lot of people. Thoroughly thought and built this film is simply the modern achievement we needed for the rebirth of the action/ adventure genre in all its glory. One can only hope Mad Max Fury Road will destroy everything at the box office this summer so Miller will start work on his Mad Max Furiosa.... ",

1064,20 May 2015,Wayne1138,2, Visually amazing. But a good Mad Max film??? I don't think so.......,"Well, after 30 years we finally get another Mad Max sequel after years of development hell and false starts.",
1065,26 May 2015,PrashunChakraborty,8, What a ride!,"Long story short, this movie is fun, the story is too simple in fact it's just one car chase stretched over two hours but it's still fun. Detailed review for those who are interested, this movie is an absolute visual treat, the images of the film will stay in your head for weeks if not years, if a world were ever to witness an apocalypse it will not look like the one in Mad Max, and muscle cars will probably not make it but don't think too much and enjoy the ride, Nux driving around Max as his bloodbag on his car is both hilarious and disturbing but these images stick with you, this movie has what it takes to make that visual impact and even make smartphone addicts stop and look up. Most people would think that Fury Road is Furiosa's story and Mad Max has no contribution to the film on an emotional level. But this is not true, the bedrock of this movie is the relationship between Max and Furiosa, I found this the most appealing aspect of the film, I was afraid that there was going to be some unnecessary romance but their relationship is so much more than that, it's one of mutual respect, admiration and even need of each other, they have something bigger than romance they are truly comrades in war, brothers (or sisters?) in war. Of course this is Hollywood and they may just screw this up in the sequel but right now I was just pleased to see such a platonic relationship between the two leads. Both Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are in peak form in here. However, my personal favorite was Nicholas Hoult's Nux. Max and Furiosa seek redemption and are tortured by it, and Nux achieves redemption faster than them both. He is a great comic relief which is surprising since he is a homicidal hormonal teenager but it works. Nux is also the medium through whom the director is communicating to the viewer how screwed up the wasteland of Mad Max is, he is the craziest character among the good people who are all normal he is the constant reminder to the viewer that this world has gone to hell. Also he says the iconic line- ""What a day, what a lovely day"". almost every time he attempts to kill himself to achieve glory in battle, what a nutjob, I like him. The villain Immortan Joe is visually intimidating and some parallels /analogy may be drawn about him being an abusive pimp who is trying to reclaim his ""property"" as he puts it, this simple motivation is enough to make Joe a bad guy and be hated. Sex trafficking is a theme quite prevalent in Mad Max but it's understated, it's upto the viewer to figure out in an otherwise starightforward movie. Joe on top of being all that is greedy too but the film doesn't focus much on that. One of the things that really bothered me was that how easily Nux turned on his former boss, all it took was a red head supermodel. It was quite lame, why is Furiosa even attempting such a wild mission? Warboys and the entire army of Immortan Joe are hormonal young men, Furiosa may just as well say - We got supermodels, the best women for breeding on this wasteland here boys, let us up. BAM Immortan Joe dead, the boys let the girls in. Overall I liked the film, my personal favorite Mad Max film still remains the original Mad Max (1979) because it's still to date the only Mad Max which shows character development, Max's wife and child die in that film and it's referenced all throughout Fury Road via PTSD nightmarish visions of Max. Also, Mel Gibson just does a better Mad Max than Tom Hardy who is quite good himself but he doesn't portray enough of Mad Max like Gibson did over three movies.",

Peter Kreeft, following on this line, said the the Third Reich was supposed to last a thousand years but only held for over a decade simply because it chose to build itself through killing its own. A similar note rings throughout Mad Max: Fury Road as we are presented with a story of humanity at a crossroads in figuring out how to rebuild itself after a profound era of destruction. ",
1088,11 June 2015,navyshark55,5, Over-hyped. OKAY BUT NOT EPIC.,"What can I say about Mad Max: Feminist Road. First, the film attempts to coast your attention with a two hour car chase. While the action is decently brutal, the plot has grand room for improvement. First and foremost, no-one tells Mad Max what to do. The idea of Mad Max is that he is the master of his own fate. This film degrades him to just another one-dimensional character like all the others. Again, action was decent but there was little to no incentive to care about the characters. ",

I may give it another try but I seriously doubt it. I am a big Tom Hardy fan but this has to be the worst movie he has been a part of I hope that if he is in any squeals that they give him a way bigger part and a better script.

1111,4 June 2015,PWNYCNY,9, Heroism in a sordid world.,"The first half of this movie was almost entirely dominated by special effects which obscured the story. The second half was much more intense, as the relationship between Max and Furiosa developed. Charlize Theron was marvelous as Furiosa. Her character is the most developed and the one with whom the audience could empathize. The same could not be said for Max. He is a wanderer; we know little else about him. The world is harsh, and Max is a battered wreck who is barely surviving. Furiosa is also battered, but she is beautiful, as well as heroic and idealistic. She is willing to risk her life for others in a world where the value of human life is zero. Max also is heroic, but yet is still a wanderer. The post-apocalyptic world is presented starkly. It is a wasteland where resources are scare and whoever controls the resources has power. There is a dictator who reigns through terror and controls the resources. He is the bad guy. But is Max a good guy? The cast is excellent; their performances are powerful. Although this movie is science fiction, its premise, that civilization can collapse, is not without plausibility. Tom Hardy performs excellently as Max. Although brutalized, Max maintains his dignity. The question is whether he and Furiosa and trust each other. To find out what happens, watch the movie.",

The film is worth watching but I don't want there to be many such films.

1118,6 September 2015,meeza,6, Was mad with disappointment! But loved the cinematography!!!,"Don't get mad with me to the max, but I was not enthralled at all with ""Mad Max:Fury Road"". George Miller's redux of his classic 80's Mad Max franchise was mostly about visual storytelling but there was no true connection with any of the characters, mostly the madman himself Max. If you are not familiar with this franchise, the film takes place in a dystopian future where eccentric characters set the pave to a divided society. Tom Hardy stars as Max, who is about to be killed in some type of mundane ""chain to a speeding truck"" kind of deal; when circumstances change, he now joins a group of female rebels led by Imperator Furiosa, profoundly played by Charlize Theron; but not to the caliber of Oscar nominated, don't get furioso with me, just my take. Tom Hardy, who is one of my favorite actors, turns out his worst performance of his career; he looked lost and stale throughout the picture. However, I am still in the Tom Tom Club as a Hardy fan; Hardy har har. Nicholas Hoult was sound as the desperate Nux. Director George Miller's direction was way over the top, and not much could be said of his limited screenplay. Hey, but I did not hate it all together. John Seale's brilliant cinematography got my seal of approval. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" was a road for me that will be less traveled. *** Average",

George Miller reinvigorates the series that he started back in 1979, if you've never seen the original Mad Max and The Road Warrior, or even Beyond Thunderdome which is probably the weakest entry in the series, but a favorite nonetheless. Stop what your doing, go watch these masterpieces staring the legendary actor Mel Gibson, It will tell you the complete backstory of who Max Rockatansky was, before he became the survivor warrior that he is. I'm a big fan of Tom Hardy's and was stoked, when he was cast in role of Max, he brings a new and fresh take on the character. I've really missed the character of Mad Max, weather it's Mel Gibson or Tom Hardy in the role, it's feels so good to see the character kick ass, in a world without rules or governments, where survival is king. This film truly lives up to those that came before, and what is yet to come. If your a huge fan of the franchise see it you won't be disappointed!!!!. 10/10.",

Meaning the landing could not be done the angles are wrong, one car you can see hit the cliff and falls behind, but next shoot he is pulling in front of truck like nothing happen. To me the worst part is the story line. The 1st Mad Max had a real story line, and the 2nd one, and 3rd one. For those who have not seen the original Mad Max I would suggest seeing them and you will see how much better they are. in every way. Well CG might not be but they really didn't need it.",

I was AMAZED how they did it and filmed it!",
1131,26 May 2015,Foal24,9, Sensory overload!!,"Mad Max: Fury Road is a triumphant realisation of all that is possible on the big screen. The explosions, the violence, the sounds!! Forget all that you think you know about blockbuster action movies. This is it!! Okay, let's pump the brakes for a second. What makes a classic movie? Storyline and dialogue. Sure, but we'll have none of that here thank you! Not necessary!! Don't get me wrong, I love a good, cleverly written movie with witty dialogue and an interesting premise, plus a dash of quirkiness. But, although 'Mad Max' is indeed interesting it doesn't have or need any of that other stuff. This is visual story telling in its most basic and pure form. It is little more than a car chase through the desert spanning a couple of days and destroying countless vehicles and lives along the way. And it is beyond epic. This is quite possibly the most action packed movie I have ever seen. At times it borders on complete sensory overload. There is just so much awesome stuff going on (including a gimp chained to a truck playing a flame throwing guitar!!). And ladies, yes, you should be going to see this with your boyfriend/husband/significant other. Hell, go with the girls. The thing is this: I don't remember ever seeing a movie with so many strong female characters in it kicking serious arse. True, many of them are insanely hot, but some are also old and wrinkly. All are awesome. Girl power all the way. I would be so darn happy if I went to see this again and there were big groups of girls going to celebrate having a vag and an attitude in this high speed desert pursuit rather than the formulaic, clichéd bullshit that is 'Pitch Perfect 2'. Sorry, I just don't care how funny Fat Amy is. Director George Miller deserves to be knighted. Or, at the very least, he should be given his own reality TV show where he gets to judge the everyday functions of everyday people in a situation that makes it seem somehow not mundane, thereby becoming the most popular personality on TV. The guy is a saint. When I first heard they were making a new Mad Max a thousand years after 'Thunderdome' I was highly skeptical. No way could he pull this off. No way could he make this relevant. Modern audiences won't appreciate it. What's he gonna do? Have an old Mel Gibson? Oh wait, Tom Hardy is going to play Max and it's going to be set around the same time as the original movies??? I dunno man I have never been so happy to be wrong about a movie. The theme song from the Lego movie belongs here now. Everything is awesome. Quite simply, this is the best movie I've seen this year. Go see it. 9.5/10 See all our reviews at www.facebook.com/shenaniganmoviereviews",

Almost the perfect manifestation of an action film, this recent ""Mad Max"" franchise installment goes to show that (somewhat) steady camera work and a well-built (read: minimal CGI) world full of unique characters can leave an audience in awe of its accomplishment.

Female lead is decent, some interesting bad guys and some good fight scenes/special effects, but none of this is enough to elevate this film above the level of dire in my view. They did try to keep some of the charming madness from the original Mad Max, but ultimately, whilst they had some success, the film is let down by the very poor plot and script, and mediocre acting. Ultimately, whilst an action movie, you have to connect with and career about the characters, at least to some degree, but with this film, it simply wasn't possible. Avoid. 4 / 10.",

1147,15 August 2015,salil_kapoor_gurgaon,2," Mad ""Maxxie"" : Death to all Men and to all Qafirs.............","This is a classic example of peaceniks propaganda in collaboration with Feminists, Political-environmentalists and Pseudo-seculars. Who could imagine Max to be a henpecked second fiddle to a gun- wielding, man hunting amputee - Furiosa. What waste of a great actor like Tom Hardy, who can stand out in every shot if cast as the leading nemesis. Alas, in this latest installment of Mad Max of the days of yore, Tom Hardy is a mere drone to the intrepid war-queen Furiosa (Charlize Theron). As far as I am concerned the very idea of Tribal-Women-Warriors is distasteful and pernicious. It hardly leaves much to imagination whom the ""War Boys"" are modeled after. They are post-apocalypse Fidayeen, indoctrinated quite like the Islamists of our times, with promises of Heaven after death, a place they scream out as ""Valhalla"" (the name surely has an Arabic sound to it). A kind touch on the forehead by a ""pure"" and ""perfect"" (not ""pious"" for a change) ""creature"" transforms the War Boy. This is such subliminal moral swashbuckling, aimed at non-Muslims, who need to be ""told"" that Fidayeens can be made friends with display of sympathy (called largesse, in the context of realpolitik). Have they not read of what India had to endure when a certain bald and dhoti-clad Mahatma used the same idea to mollycoddle Islamists ? Or has Pakistan been transformed despite America's freebies and bail-outs for years ? And if the pacifistic messaging was not enough, they went boldly Feminist on us. Women are the real warriors - NOT only can they beat the dead-crap out of men but also are the only hope for life and for the restoration of all that was valuable before the holocaust. We already have single women buying ""seed"" from sperm-banks and ""making IVF babies"" in India, proving they do not need men even to make men. Such unbelievable misandry and our law permits it. They can perhaps show humans as hermaphrodites with tits in the next installment of Mad Max. As if Indian and world mainstream Media have not been inimical enough to men and to qafirs, we now have main stream movie producers jumping on the bandwagon. What next ? They might start selling Mad- Max punching bags at Decathlon with ""Men"" and ""Qafirs"" painted on those. It is a global hit and enjoys an obscenely high rating of 8.4 on IMDb.

Miller created a fantasy world where men playing flame throwing guitars and leaping through high speed chases on pull-vaults seems like a typical milk run. The movie keeps a relentless action pace that makes all of the absurdity seem so completely ordinary, which might be the real magic of this movie. This is only really possible because the action, filmography, set choices and music are so brilliant you cannot help but believe the insanity that plays out before you.

Still, I hoped it was going to be a little more than a two-hour car chase with grotesque pageant floats. I am aware that narration doesn't play a big role in this kind of films, but then why eat up two whole hours with the same thing? I was wildly entertaining for the first half or so, but my interest started dropping once I realized that it was going to be a round trip.",

Unlike the marvel full comedy hour Avenger movies,the moviegoer feels the action and wants to see what happens next.This is not the best movie made or a super perfect masterpiece like some reviews are raving, but its the best movie out right now.If there is a second Mad Max movie to be made, this kind of formula and filming would be great for this kind of series.",

There is a some good in this movie but there is so much bad that it is greatly disappointing. Ridiculous moments include: water is in short supply and precious yet when it is doled out by the local kingpin it is wasted with most pouring onto the ground; a rock guitarist in red long johns in the desert on the speaker filled truck; a nipple chained corpulent character; spray painting mouths to be ""chrome bumper like"" as an exit statement before dying; lighting a road flare inside a gas filled car with no explosion (gas ain't water, folks) and on and on.

This is pure action cinema,it's rare that the genre gets turned into Art,but make no mistake,that's what is going on here,the color choices,framing,layers of costuming,vehicle detailing,every facet of the production is pure art,beautiful and astounding. This story is not about Max,but about an adventure he was caught up in,I loved this approach,really refreshing,why can't Furiosa be the star? Max is still there,what's the big deal?

Tom Hardy wasn't bad as the new Max and Charlize Theron's Furiosa was a strong female character in the tradition of the franchise. I am a fan of both of these actors, but the screenplay was just awful; cheesy, lame dialogue, so bad it was vomit inducing: ""Why are you hurting those people?"" - ""It's the oil stupid."" - ""Mankind has gone rogue, terrorising itself."" The Fury Road prologue was badly written trash compared to the poetic prologue of The Road Warrior. ""Do not my friends, become addicted to water, it will take hold of you and you will resent its absence."" WTF? Who wrote this moronic tripe? Fury Road broke the cardinal rule of film-making - Show, Don't Tell. Fury Road showed us nothing (except car chases and stunts) and Told us Everything (very badly). Fury Road introduced some interesting concepts and then failed to explore any of them adequately, and subsequently the expositional info dumps were totally unbelievable. A good sequel should expand on the original, and show us something new along with the familiar elements. Apart from the pathetic Granny Biker Gang, Fury Road showed us exactly what we had seen before except it was ten times more over the top. Even the awful Beyond Thunderdome showed us something new.",

I don't know what I saw other than a never ending car chase, barely any dialog or plot development, and 'weird' things just thrown in there as if the writer/director or anyone who was part of production was totally stoned/high. Seriously a flame throwing guitar? you would think in a place where water and fuel was scarce there would be massive conservation efforts. Not a drumming vehicle or a a driving guitar thing. Luckily i saw this on Netflix as i would never forgive myself if I actually paid to see this movie in an actual theater. This movie as well as the former - should have never been made. It should have ended with the 1981 film and that's it. The 8.1 rating on IMDb also has me doubting IMDb itself as this movie I don't see how 8/10 is possible unless its a negative number.

1198,18 May 2015,burlesonjesse5,7, VIEWS ON FILM review of Mad Max: Fury Road,"In the mid-1980's, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior represented the first time I ever saw a movie on VHS. No joke. There I was, taking in the existential, catastrophic splendor and thrusted into a funky, eclectic world that only director George Miller could deposit me in. I was also taken aback by the aura of star Mel Gibson. He didn't say much. He just drove the big rig and gave any punk rocker delinquent the business (via a veritable, sawed-off shotgun). When the announcement that a new installment was on the horizon (some thirty years later), it was also predicated on the fact that Australia's favorite son be omitted from the lead role. Brit Tom Hardy who seems to be everywhere these days, got to inhabit the driver's seat (ha-ha). The question on every moviegoer's mind is can he fill the shoes of ""mad"" Mel? The answer is, it doesn't matter. Mad Max: Fury Road isn't entirely about the character of Max Rockatansky. And Hardy for what it's worth, only possesses about a smidgen of Melle Mel's ear to the grindstone screen presence. For practical purposes though, he'll do and so will the movie. Its plot is slight yet there are action sequences providing enough scorched antics and kinetic motion to make your eyes shoot through the back of your head. We're talking apocalypse now more than ever.",

1200,2 June 2015,Seraphion,7," Two hours of crazy cars, car-chases and pure action","The story is just another one of those cliché action movie stories of the hero helping the party who is running from the evil ruler. It even completes with the common finale of the evil ruler dying at the end and the escaping party gets to become the new ruler. Nothing new from the story as there's no new ingredient added to the story as a whole, not even a good enough twist. Yet This movie grants a spectacular display of a very crazy action, from start to end. From the time as Furiosa starts to veer off her course the movie just doesn't give any room to stop to catch your breath. And the action is the kind of action which you rarely see in other action movies, with lots and lots of crazy stunts everywhere. I also like how the movie keeps and even develops the original Mad Max's style of vehicular mods and character designs. The acting overall is a great job for me. Tom Hardy's portrayal of Max really equals, if not bested, Mel Gibson's performances from the original movies. The voice play is also nice. Charlize Theron can really make her character stand out. Nicholas Hoult did great to shed his previous characters and play this role of crazy eager War Boy.",

We were in the same high school TV and Video Production class and we both love film, but he's a radical film fan. So when he came to school and told me ""Mad Max: Fury Road is the best action film I've ever had the privilege to watch in theaters."" I replied, ""Chill out dude I'm sure it's good but it's not that good."" He kept on hyping it for me so when I eventually did see it, it was not even close to what I was expecting. It took me three viewings of Mad Max: Fury Road for me to realize it was a great film. I have now come to the conclusion, that although Spotlight was a GREAT movie, Mad Max: Fury Road was the best film of 2015. There has never been a director I've watched in my life that took more risks with the camera than George Miller in this movie. He directs the crap out of this movie. It is one of the best directed films I've ever seen, and my film watching career includes over 500 movies. The acting is first rate and spectacular, however the visuals and absolutely fantastic imagery overtake the great performances across the board which further proves my point that it is a fantastically directed movie. I can't find a single flaw with this film. If it had won best picture I would have been one happy camper. It is a GREAT movie, and I will be upset if it does not make this years AFI top 100. You are doing yourself a major disservice if you do not see this movie, it is beyond what I would call a great film.

Technically, the cinematography is very well done and the bendy poles swinging in and out of the frame was inventive. The electric guitar shooting fire was wonderfully bombastic and signals that subtlety will play no part in this film. Immortan Joe was a little too derivative of Batman's Bane, and the romance sub-plot between the harem wife and the fanatical War Boy pushed credulity to its limits. It's a big, loud, sumptuous post-apocalyptic opera of a film, and pretty much delivers on what it promises. Pure escapism designed to sell popcorn, and does it very well.",

There literally isn't even a story there, it tells you nothing what so ever. I was practically begging for the film to end so I could leave. Throughout the entire film myself and everyone else in the screening with me had no idea what the hell was going on. For a good 20 minutes or so into the film you don't know anything, you are told nothing and a clear storyline is not present. You learn nothing about the characters, the only person's name I knew by the end was Max. And what the hell was with that relationship between one of those albino guys and that hot chick. They spoke for like 2 minutes and they are suddenly in loving relationship. That's also a good point, why the hell are there hundreds of albinos that isn't explained,why do they believe in Valhalla and shiz, also not explained. A lot of other things are left unexplained but I can't remember off the top of my head because i'm trying to forget I even went to see this film. Also am I supposed to know who these boss guy's are and what there goals are, because I have no idea. The only redeeming quality of this film that I can think of is the action.......oh, and that guitar albino. That is all. The biggest shock of all though is why so many people are giving this film good reviews and comments. I mean do you even know what a good film is people!",

Of course Immortal Joe gives chase. He wants his property back as he considers them more valuable than oil or even gas mostly because they can have babies.

The visuals are absolutely stunning and the special effects are up there with the best of the best. But, what really takes Mad Max to the next level is its subtlety. It uses subtlety in a way that not too many other films can, let alone action films. Sure, there is some dialogue that is too blatant in its goal to move the story forward but most of the world-building and plot movement comes not from dialogue but from everything else. The all-out action, the changes in scenery and the characters' general demeanor all help shape the world that the movie takes place in and tell the story. This is a credit to everyone involved in the film. Everything is done so well. The visuals, sound, acting, directing, everything.

1238,24 May 2015,johnnymacbest,9, The best Mad Max film I've ever seen.,"I'll keep this straight and to the point. For YEARS I've waited for a film that lives up to the originals. Although Beyond Thunderdome was decent in it's own right, the film lost it's dark and gritty edge due to it's PG-13; a bane on dark, gritty post-apocalyptic films. Well, fear not for I am happy to report that Fury Road, is every bit as dark and gritty as it's predecessors. Tom Hardy does another incredible job as the world weary Max, a man with nothing to lose wandering the arid, desolate Australian wasteland, with little pockets of civilization here and there. Well, the term ""civilization"" is aptly used loosely here because most of them are anything but ""civilized"" as these roving band of savages try to eek out a bleak existence by any means necessary and this is the perfect backdrop for the story. With little twists and turns here and there, along with the impressive visuals and riveting action, Fury Road is a crystal clear reminder that CGI and MTV style action does not and should not take the place of a well-written story. Hopefully, a sequel is made. I'm that pumped for it. Best Mad Max film I've ever seen in years. Mad Max is back and he's better than ever.",

The warning may as well have extended to the film's audience to not get addicted to breathing. George Miller's retread of his apocalyptic '80s asphalt nightmare is arguably even more bonkers than its predecessors, bludgeoning viewers at such a gleefully manic pace that holding one's breath becomes as much the norm as the pounding sands of the film's eternal desert. The film, undeniably, is 'capital-M movie-making' at its most batsh*t, as Miller, finally gifted with a $150 million budget, orchestrates his apocalyptic fever-dream with frantic energy and furious passion.

I, for one, am not a fan of modern day action movies. They are lazy, CGI clusters that are just made to look good, and they can't even do that right. Modern day directors simply don't understand how to make an action movie. Thankfully, George Miller hasn't forgotten. Miller's Mad Max remembers something that all others seem to have forgotten, the fun aspect. Fury Road is pure fun. It doesn't let story of perfect development get in the way of that. The story remains simple, as it should be. The other major problem with modern day action is the overuse of CGI. Fury Road has an astounding lack of it. The amount of practical effects in this movie is amazing, the movie simply looks great. If it had all been done with CGI, this would have been much more disappointing.

1250,11 May 2015,andynaik,7," Visually stunning, action-packed yet lacking","I was lucky enough to catch an advanced screening of this movie. After  watching the trailer, I was really excited to see this movie and it did  live up to my expectations to a certain extent.  Max (Tom Hardy) is a cop on the run in a post-apocalyptic world which  is now a barren wasteland. He is captured by Captain Immortan Joe and  his gang for his blood. There, they seek to turn him into one of their  own by branding him. Immortan is an evil lord in charge of the only  water and oil supply. He uses his reserves as a means of power over  other humans and he has a large gang (War Boys) to keep everyone in  check.  Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is working for Immortan but then decides to  make a run for it with a few other women (fertile women are in a short  supply as well) to a greener land. She makes the escape in a truck  filled with 3000 gallons of guzzling (water or oil) to make a deal with  a small pack of motorcycle riders in the desert.  As she is chased by Immortan's gang, she unwittingly takes Max who then  offers her help to escape the gang. The rest of the movie is then set  of the various chase scenes and the attempts of Furiosa, Max and the  girls to escape to the green land.  The cinematography and the visual imagery is certainly stunning, worth  experiencing on an IMAX screen. The chase scenes and the landscape  (especially a few scenes in moonlight) were absolutely amazing. The  various concoctions of war vehicles is amazing as well. There were a  few elements of humor as well paired with some really weird things  (women's milk supply, the various outfits and characters including a  guy playing a fire breathing electric guitar throughout the chase  scenes). The music definitely adds to the atmosphere as well, not to  mention the various stunts. The action really gets crazy towards the  end.  On the other hand, there were some things I found lacking. Character  development is certainly missing and there's definitely nothing  significant there to make a connection with the various characters. The  dialogue is ordinary and cliché. The ending is predictable and certain  things don't make sense (like how a gang with tons of ammo and better  equipped vehicles) is unable to stop Furiosa and Max.  One thing is certain, it was different and entertaining, hence a 7/10",
1251,6 September 2015,brchthethird,9," George Miller's triumphant return puts other ""Mediocre!"" action films to shame","At this point, there's probably nothing original I could write about MAD MAX FURY ROAD. Following a long gestation period and an insane level of hype that it most certainly lived up to, this long-awaited sequel/reboot was just the kind of fuel injection that the action blockbuster has been in need of for quite some time. It's a balls-to-the-wall action film that is brimming with subtext in a way that most dramas don't even come close to matching. What George Miller has done is bring cinema back to the basics of the story told through moving images, with dialogue/exposition brought to a minimum. In the absence of a lot of talking, which some will interpret as a lack of story/plot while others will simply be turned off, the characters are developed through their actions, what they wear, what they drive, etc. It's basically a production designer's heaven, as there are no superfluous details. Everything and everyone in this world has a purpose, but you have to be perceptive enough to catch it; it will also take multiple viewings to be able to truly absorb all of the little things because a lot of them pass by so quickly. In response to the ignoranamuses/ignorami(?) who belittle the film for its apparent feminist stance, a careful viewing of the film will put that to rest. Yes, the female characters are strong and have agency, but they are given equal status to the male characters. All you have to do is look at the patriarchal society led by Immortan Joe and the Many Mothers. In both power structures, the absence of the other has led them down a precarious path that is only rectified when they (Max and Furiosa) realize that they have to work together in order to survive. The basic message of the film is redemption is only possible through mutual respect and teamwork. Of course, there's all of the action. Seeing as the film is basically a two-hour chase, there are quite a few set-pieces which only get better as the film progresses. And what makes this even more glorious is that these were accomplished in a largely practical manner (with a couple notable exceptions). And because endless action would wear you out, there are a few brief moments of respite where the philosophical underpinnings of the film are made a little bit clearer. Taken as a whole, MAD MAX FURY ROAD is perhaps one of the most complete action films, and a perfectly good example of what Hitchcock termed ""pure cinema"" (and was also a term used by Miller in promotion for the film). My only complaint is that some of the dialogue is a little bit silly, and isn't helped by some occasionally stilted delivery. However, that's a minor quibble when considering how fully realized the film is. George Miller has come back with a vengeance and shown the imitators how its done, even besting (in my opinion) the high mark set by his original trilogy. Do yourself a favor and see this for yourself if you haven't already (or again, if you have).",
1252,24 October 2015,Bruce722,7, Better than expected.,"Mad Max: Fury Road was far from a perfect film but it was much more enjoyable than I anticipated. It was exciting, the acting was great, the story (yes, unlike what you've been told there's actually a story) was captivating and, while not really all that original, it felt fresh and unique in how it was told. Overall, this was very entertaining and I look forward to future installments. The negatives were that Charlize Theron has way too large of a role. Even in the trailer and promotional posters, she's clearly the star. Does this hurt the film? Not necessarily but it feels unnecessary. The story should've focused more on Max. We got almost no backstory for his character whatsoever and he maybe speaks a dozen lines. The other element that was a weak point was that some of the scenes were a bit too ridiculous. I expect some of it but not to the extent where you have a guy standing on top of a vehicle traveling at high speeds through the desert while playing an electric guitar with flames coming out of the tip.

Fantastic !!,"With a budget of nearly £100,000,000 (or should I say nearly £100,000,000 more than the original 1979 Mad Max) you would expect this to be pretty good ?! so just as well its absolutely fantastically brilliant (and barking mad) then. Tom Hardy is becoming one of my favourite actors, he is so versatile. Charlize Theron is brilliant as usual! Nicholas Hoult (yes you might say I recognise him from something) shows he has come a long way since About A Boy and there's a great bunch of baddies. The assortment of vehicles are the real stars though, they have taken the cut and shunt to a whole new level ! wacky racers look like normal cars in comparison !. I think the 3D effects were pretty good too, not overdone and well worth seeing in this format. Doesn't really compare to the first Mad Max which looks quite dated and cheap now but does resemble the better MM Road Warrior. So if you looking for nearly 2 hours of action packed fun set in a deserted dystopian future you must go see this. Defo one for the Blu Ray list this crimbo. My new favourite of the year so far.",

Where some people may think some aspects of the movie are ""stupid,"" (such as the guitar player), I thought it was perfect. People think these bad things about these small aspects of the characters, but in the end, that is the point. The movie is madness. Everyone has gone crazy. No one cares. That is what makes me love this movie so much. Not to mention, the action is 10/10.",

A very OK movie.,"""If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die historic on the fury road."" Max (Hardy) is a loner and a drifter who has been captured and is being used as a ""blood bag"". Imperator Furiosa (Theron) is charged with leading a group to a distant city. When she takes a detour the ruler of the village isn't happy and sets out to find her and bring her back. Max and Furiosa form an unlikely alliance in order to save a group of prisoners from the tyrannical leader. I wasn't really looking all that forward to this movie. I wasn't a huge fan of the Mel Gibson series and wasn't expecting anything great from this movie. It may have been my low expectations but this movie wasn't that bad and it was pretty entertaining throughout. The best part of this movie is that it didn't try and do too much. It knew what the audience wanted and it is basically a 2 hour car chase movie. There is nothing amazing or horrible in this movie. On one hand it was better than I expected, but on the other hand it really didn't do anything to wow me or add anything extra special to set it apart from the originals, or Death Race for that matter. Nothing else really to say other than this is pretty much what you are expecting it to be. A very safe feeling middle of the road action movie. Overall, entertaining but didn't really take any chances and didn't set itself apart from other movies like this. It is very watchable though. I give it a B.",

Some movies are for profit but you get a strong sense that everyone who worked on this was aware they where participating in creating something great and Millers dedication seems to have spread like a plague. The post production was unrivaled and a thing of true beauty. The utilization of frame rates that was experimented with in the previous MM films was honed to perfection and turned into a special effect of emotions all to it's own. Due to the heightened frame rates and extensive frames more movie was packed into a smaller time frame.The manipulation of frame rate was able to subliminally transcend the protagonist plot armor barrier. If I could criticize this movie, it's in not easing up on the viewer throughout the entire film with this subliminal trick. This factor alone makes it worthy of it's R rating and fury title.

1280,15 May 2015,magjerd2,4, This is just about as amazing as a movie can be without any signs of a good story.,"I was actually quite hooked the first 10-15 minutes, the cinematography was surprisingly sublime for what I thought to be an ordinary action film. The colours, sounds and everything visual was just extraordinary.. at first. But you need more than just that to carry a movie all the way to the end, and this movie had absolutely nothing else to offer. Guns, grenades and explosions? Cool. Fast cars, trucks and monstertrucks banging into each other? Cool. But when at least 80% of this movie is exclusively cars, trucks and monstertrucks banging into each other while shooting and throwing speargrenades in high speed, things get real boring at one point. You sit and wait for a sorely needed turning point, and when you think it has finally come, you realize that it's not a turning point in its common sense, it's a literal turning point! After having followed the film's unbelievably lucky main characters crossing the desert in a truck whilst fighting for about an hour, they stop, and do a damn U-turn to do the same thing all over again.. And the action scenes are nothing short of repetitive. How many times do we have to see Charlize Theron make a determined expression and then bang into the cars following her, how many times do we have to see some white warboy throw an explosive spear? Cool for 20 minutes, but for an hour and a half? No. Long action scenes work only when combined with good screen writing and a good underlying story. No amount of beautiful cinematography, authentic explosions and whatnot can make up for the lack this movie has of the basics; a good story and interesting characters. If this film stays among the top films on the top250 list, I will be ashamed to be an IMDb-user. In terms of cinematography and orginality, this movie is an achievement. If you like movies that don't give a damn about screen writing, this is the movie for you! If you prefer a film with substance, save your money and your time.",

Noted, I haven't seen the original movie, so I'm not sure if the story is the same, and thus I can't make comparisons. But, for what I have seen, the movie is rich with action and it will keep you interested throughout it's length. Sure, the performances aren't award winning, and the emotion never reaches a high point, and so, if you don't like action movies and prefer dramas, my suggestion is not to watch Mad Max.

1293,28 May 2017,sol-,7, Road Warriors,"Tom Hardy takes over the role made famous by Mel Gibson in this fourth film in the 'Mad Max' series. The plot has Max reluctantly team up with a renegade female trucker transporting the abused, pregnant wives of a tyrant to safety; distrust turns to mutual respect as the pair fend off attacks from the tyrant's underlings. Right from the opening monologue, 'Fury Road' feels like a decidedly different 'Mad Max' film; add in cutaways to Max's memories of a young girl and the action hero is more conflicted and haunted here than ever before. The film additionally does something different by giving Charlize Theron much screen time as the gutsy trucker with her own insecurities as she searches for her hometown as a safe place for the wives. These two angles do not mesh all that well together, with Max oddly relegated to a supporting character despite a deeper than ever glimpse into his psyche. The limited exposition also leaves open unanswered questions regarding blood transfusions, whether fertility is an issue and what everyone's obsession is with painting their teeth. Some elements (a rock guitarist strapped to the front of one truck) also come off as simply weird for the sake of it. And yet, if never entirely successful, there remains something to like in George Miller taking the material in new directions rather than just recycling what has been done before.",

The little things we see do not make much sense left alone and surely create unnecessary thoughts in some viewers distracting them from staying in the never ending action. Because of this action only perspective the movie could get even boring for a few people craving for a bit more than action on the road till the very end. The entire plot is totally idiotic to be honest and serves only the purpose to create one action scene after the other. If you manage to shut down your brain for the 2 hours running time you might be able to love this movie, and I think it is sad to see how many people are able to do just that, because like this there is no reason for the producers and studios to care more about the script and they will continue make idiotic empty eye candy movies.

1313,19 May 2015,IanAJohnson,7," This film was stylish, but desensitizing.","Mad Max: Fury Road is the next installment in the Mad Max franchise after a thirty year gap. In this film a damaged man named Max runs into a group of people trying to escape an evil cult leader and is forced to help them escape. Before I enter the review I want to mention that I have never seen any of the previous films in the franchise. From that perspective I found the film kind of exhausting From a technical standpoint, it is just about flawless. The action scenes are absolutely incredible to behold. The visual style is unique and the character design that goes along with it is perfect. The world building of the post-apocalyptic wasteland is really good. The film clearly shows an in depth society of people that have rallied together to not only survive, but to live. Most of the action looked practical which only made the action even more enthralling. The problem I had with the movie is that there was so little plot and character development (and what was given to us was given way too late) that I begin to ask why I should care about these people over the other survivors. Sure, their adventure might be more exiting, but I know so little about them and what I did know was so generic that I just didn't connect with them. This might not be an issue if you have seen the other films. A possible exception to this is Furiosa, the main character of the film. Do not let the title mislead you; Mad Max is not the main character. He just shows up and helps out. The entire plot is driven by Furiosa and all of the big characters moments where with her. There were some interesting moments dealing with a cult member, but it felt like all of that character development happened off screen. Most of this development is done though body language, grunts or generic responses of questions I had been asking myself for more than half an hour. The main villain was well designed, but other than being an abusive cult leader, I know nothing about him. I don't even remember his name. Some might praise the minimalist plot but since the other two hours of the film was pure action, I began to become desensitized to it. I love to eat chocolate, but if I only eat chocolate for a week I'll get sick begin to want healthier food. The same goes for action in movies. Action scenes mean more if there was build up. Again, this is not a bad movie, but I just could not get invested in what was happening enough to really care.

Yet it's so simple a story he's telling that the visuals are pretty much all that are needed; Miller relies on the visceral to move his story along. This all works because the dystopian world Miller and co-scenarists Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris creates is complete, with history, customs and rituals fully developed and identifiable; the viewer doesn't need a whole lot to buy in. This is also true in relation to the main characters, Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and Max (Tom Hardy): they don't have a lot to say but you get them immediately. Miller consistently comes up with imaginative set pieces (there's a knockout sandstorm and a nice monochromatic section is an interesting alternative to the mostly daylight action--the production design is by Colin Gibson) and displays as much Gothic grotesquery as he possibly can: there are alabaster bald children, weird midgets and startlingly obese men on wild display and that guitar player swinging from the front of the truck gave me the creeps; he gets tremendous make-up artistry from a team led by Lesley Vanderwalt, Elka Wardega and Damian Martin; every ugly image--and there are many--is beautifully rendered. Everything is full-tilt here but fortunately John Seale's cinematography and Margaret Sixel's editing are up to the task. Miller has thrown away the campy shtick that was ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" in order to revisit and fortify the series' original raison d'etre: a despairing view of a world gone insane due to a dependency on oil. Its relevance is just as timely as it was back in the days of ""The Road Warrior"" and even though it's a heady theme, this entry is just as entertaining as ""The Road Warrior"" was, only turned up to eleven. The soundtrack is by Junkie XL (he of the remix of Elvis' ""A Little Less Conversation"") and it's very good.",
1323,6 May 2016,tankace,9, What a lovely movie indeed!!,"Mad Max Fury Road is the fourth of the Mad Max franchise and it had been 30 years after the last Mad Max movie and that was Beyond Thuderdome, which was not the greatest closing chapter for the original trilogy (although if you want to find a movie to become your guilty pleasure is a great choice). When I saw it ,it blew me away with its effects, which were for the 90% of the time real and not CGI, the combat on the cars : Gladiator meets Fast and the Furious ,only it is better than any Fast and the Furious. Also the characters are hardcore madmen or women, who fit perfectly in a environment like that. My favorite is Furiose ,which is a Amazon through and through, well done Charlize Theron, you are awesome. The story is ,to tell the truth, very simplistic though that to the flick advantage in order to give space for the action to be as epic as possible, and it paid of big time. In truth George Muller create the best action movie of the decade and we are only half way through! To add to that dispute its adrenaline and gasoline fueled madness, this movie ,which maybe be the most macho movie of the 2015 has an environmentalist and feminist message to give. George Muller how did you and your team did that?! In the end I had a blast seen it and I recommended to you with closed eyes.",

1326,13 July 2020,adeckofcards,10, Narrative action,"In 2015, one of the best action movies of the new century was released, a film that takes the concept of the action genre further. 'Mad Max Fury Road'.
The story is simple, Max and Furiosa embark on a journey against Immortan Joe. Practically the film does not have much more plot, but this does not work at all against, but allows an organic development of characters and mind-blowing action sequences.
It is easy to notice that the tape is basically constant action, something quite common in a blockbuster, but the difference in 'Mad Max Fury Road' is that the action is used as a narrative resource and has, in addition to this, substance, a reason to develop.
It is admiring that a movie like 'Fury Road' exists today. A tape that does not fail in any way. A commercial film, but with a development and narrative fluidity unrelated to its status. A tape that demonstrates that female characters can be strong without forcing this, unlike many movies today. A film that is unique in its genre and that should be remembered as a new classic of action cinema.",

The first two, ""Mad Max"" and ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" were rather cheap independent films that built a cult; the third one, ""Mad Max Beyond Thunder-dome"" was a misguided expensive film that aimed but failed to do what ""Fury Road"" succeeds at. This one is a totally mad adrenaline-rush of an action film that will not only leave one breathless by its over-the-top stunt-filled explosive sequences, but, whether a fan of the older films or not, viewers should be blown right out of their seats in awe at the poetically-perfect execution of its filmmaking brilliance.",

1336,5 June 2019,RatedVforVinny,8, Perfectly flawed.,"It's very hard to review a picture that has already been regarded as a classic (and ""Best action movie of all time!"") but here goes. 'Mad Max 2' was a damn hard film to recreate and the look and feel of 'Fury Road' comes very close; with jaw-dropping stunt work and some stunning battle sequences. Just like 'The Road Warrior' (the perfect movie), it's mad folk being run-over at 120 mph, which is a standard, brilliant feature of any George Miller movie. Where it fails is that the whole film is one long chase sequence and you wonder why they are bothering to risk life and limb in doing so. For halfway through the movie the character Max has little involvement and even spends most of the second half strapped to the front of a car. The narration is told throughout the endless chase but it's unsatisfactory. As the time expects, the main character is a female, so it's more of a case of 'Mad Maxine'. You think it would have been simple to have just cut half the chasing away, developed the new Tom Hardy version of Max, to a younger audience, so they know what he's about (his history) and just crank up the violence! You really miss the colourful characters developed in 'Mad Max 2', and most of all the hilarious helicopter pilot. You had such empathy for their fate and rooted for Mel Gibson all the way. 'Fury Road', just might be the most spectacular of them all but it's perfectly flawed.",

1386,29 August 2019,mrinalmmehta,9, My Review!,This was definitely the best upgrade of the late 1980's Mad Max Trilogy. It's action filled with mild topping of comedy. It is definitely an A+. Highly recommended. Tom Hardy always reminds of the character Bane in The Dark Knight Rises,

Definitely is not an everybody-will-like-it film, but if you are one of those Zack Snyder 300 and Sucker Punch facet fans, you HAVE to check out this George Miller film. Not only is a really cool fatal feminism film, but it has this amazing post-apocalyptic scenario with a lot to say about radical religion; all this with over the edge road battle scenes during the whole film.",

This movie is basically a non stop car chase, with amazing cinematography, good acting, and a decent story in-between.
That said it's really over the top to near ridiculousness (particularly in the beginning) and fairly predictable. Also, while it didn't really affect my enjoyment that much, besides Zoe Kravitz nearly every single actor (even in the background) is white which kinda irked me.",

1391,19 September 2015,DarthVoorhees,8, Excellent in many ways but ultimately wanting...,I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed by 'Mad Max: Fury Road' if only because the super hype led my expectations to be way too high. There's a lot to love in this film and it is obviously a very meticulously planned and executed picture. If we are judging it on it's technical merits and the imagination behind it's world than 'Mad Max' could be considered masterful. I want to stress how gorgeously shot and imagined the movie is. The action sequences are painstakingly choreographed and have thematic weight to them. ,

I came away amused but disappointed by the lack of an interesting plot to complement the over-the-top action sequences and the post-apocalyptic setting (the two sequels in particular). So you can imagine my excitement when news came of a new sequel.

Nobody mentions the very thin character portrayals (repetition of expression / nobody wants to look unattractive in their behaviour on screen ) zero storyline, the pouting, the endlessly boring 1000 yard stares, superficial surface ""Hollywood Cool"" performances faking and confusing dramatic intensity for staged sexual poses and a cast doing there best to be ramp up 'the sexual' or 'sexually aggressive' won't save a poorly written action film with thinly built characters you feel absolutely nothing for. Some of the photography and some of the colour grading is beautiful but good look feeling anything for the characters as your watch this hyped up commercial cataclysm that tries its best to get you hooked on bare skin sex and violence but loses its way amidst the endless sand storms of overly long desert car chases.

It's very ludicrous but fun. The action-staging is as good as ever but there are only echoes of the earlier heights of suspense because we don't care too much about the characters, particularly Max - once a clever and resourceful character, now just... sullen. Despite frequent flash- back cuts to show him as haunted, he's more one-dimensional than ever as portrayed by the sparse and strangely accented mumblings of the usually reliable Tom Hardy. Charlize Theron gets only a little more to work with and it's Nicholas Hoult who gets the stand-out character which could be parodying our current preoccupation with religiously radicalised youth. The plot is very simple and calculated only to provide maximum chase scenes. Visually inventive, accomplished and well integrated with effects ...but the film is missing it's usual humour, any basis in drama and perhaps therefore our engagement with the non-stop action.",

With Mad Max, it lives up to the reputation. the whole world that is created in this film is marvellous, real aesthetic is built up before the torrent of violence occurs. while of course the film is never going to be heavily character based with complex layered story lines, for what it is, it is a widely enjoyable film. the costume and design is very absorbing in itself, with realistic props being created. I do feel the film needed a little more dialogue, the characters often became unrelatable or cared for due to the lack of development, if something bad happened to certain characters, often the feeling created was less than sympathetic. overall, however, it remains a strong film with good aesthetics created and enough fast paced drama to ensure the film progressed at a good rate.",

I would give it a 1810375930102974920194858920 out of 10 if I could! There are a few snobby critics that honestly, are a bit too critical, don't listen to them. If you love fire, blood, action, creepy creatures, guns, and gore, this is honestly the most amazing movie you'll ever see. Ever. I am a massive movie addict, and am pretty picky typically, but this movie is by far my favorite movie I've seen in years. I left the theater wanting more and more, and haven't stopped thinking about it since. Yes, there isn't an insane totally incredible ""storyline"" but I didn't even care. Yes, there are prolonged action scenes, pretty much the entire movie, but it's freaking AMAZING. I am a makeup artist and blogger, and have done a few ""Mad Max Fury Road"" inspired makeup looks! The crust punk, edgy, gory, gorgeous feel, is just astounding. Being artistic like myself, I was seriously baffled by how amazing the whole ""look"" and feel of the film was. The makeup was incredible, the cinematography was amazing, the colors were so dark yet vibrant, I thought the acting was awesome! Tom Hardy grunts a lot and doesn't talk too much, but I think that added to the whole effect! Nux is the craziest little awesome thing. Ever. The guitar playing thing? Most eerie, creepy, incredible thing ever. There's quite a lot of dark humor in this film, so if you aren't into dark, ""dry"" humor, creepy, frightening creature things, and you hate blood and crazy awesome action, then yeah, this won't be the film for you! But if you just enjoy a stinking amazing, Gory, creepy, kick butt movie from time to time, you NEED Mad Max in your life. Basically, I'm counting the days until the next one comes out because I'm OBSESSED. I actually think the term obsessed doesn't even express my love for this movie. Take a chance, see it yourself, because I highly doubt you'll regret it. I am a major superhero and scary movie fanatic, and this topped every movie I've seen in years. That says a LOT for me! My husband said the same thing, and he's quite the movie snob as well! I won't stop recommending this movie to people because I just think it's stinking amazing. See it, love it, and it'll be such a LOVELY day ;) just thank me later, babes.",

1411,2 November 2020,Giz_Medium,5," ""one of the few that passes the bechdel test, but like most action movie, it seems pretty light on the story""","The challenge is/was to review anything, right? I'm the only one setting the rules here and likely the only one reading these reviews. I got to say I wasn't particularly excited about the revival of yet another franchise, even though I enjoyed the first three episodes of the post-environmental collapse series made in the 1980's, but when armies of masculinists took to their keyboards to attack this movie with their uninvited comments about a feminist takeover of the series, I sort of had to watch it. So yeah, turns out max is arrested and used as a slave, or as a ""bloodbag"" to transfuse a soldier of a local warlord. Even if it doesn't seem to follow the timeline of the previous episodes, the character is the same, haunted by the ghosts of the people he couldn't save, to the point that he is mostly an antihero, talking only in whispers and awkward short sentences. The main character of the story is furiosa, played by charlize therron, driver of the oil-rig who is going to escape and be purchased for the entire lengh of the movie because it's a road-movie afterall, in order to save the five women of the warlord who didn't want to be ""breeders"" anymore, and trying to reach a safe space, furiosa' home from which she had been abducted as a child, except it turns out hope was a mistake and ""home"" also collapsed. It's a fast-paced action movie in which most of the developped characters are women and likely one of the few that passes the bechdel test, but like most action movie, it seems pretty light on the story, especially the background of the characters, except for max' which are deducted from the previous episodes of the franchise.",
1412,28 October 2015,samfischer88,10, Wow... Amazing,"George Miller really is a mastermind! This was essentially 90 minutes of pure adrenaline rush. Tom Hardy hardly had to talk, and he still gave a thrilling performance as the new Max. He is a certified action star now! Max is taken on an adventure when he is used as a blood bank for Nicholas Hoult's character. He ends up escaping his role and meets up with Charlize Theron as she helps out the Villain's many child baring wives. George Miller and Hugh Keays-Byrne did an absolutely fantastic job developing the villain, Immortan Joe. He is this years best villain, and it won't be close at all. He is an absolute terror that is relentless in pursuit of his wives. The chase scene as Joe chases his wives is about 90% of the movie, with absolutely crazy stunts and events occurring in this chase. George Miller showed everyone what a chase scene should be (Take note Fast and Furious Franchise). There are some twists and heartbreaks along the way which really adds to the main storyline as well, just proving that Miller knows exactly what he is doing with the Max franchise. Just sit back, and enjoy the ride!",

While the premise is simple, the dialog minimal, the acting was spot on and despite it being a Mad Max film, i think it was Charlize Theron that stole the show. Great work from the props department as those vehicles were just outrageous and wardrobe and make-up planted us firmly in George Millers post apocalyptic world and this is where the cinematography came in. Some of those shot looked gorgeous. Steering away from the rule of thirds and planting the main actor or action center frame with a backdrop of beautiful locations.

There are almost no words to describe the sheer brilliance of George Miller's latest effort, the finished product speaks for itself. The action is high octane and non-stop, it is a beautiful film to look at, and that largely has to do with the fact that almost all of it is achieved through practical effects. I read somewhere that director George Miller spent 17 years to work on a script for Fury Road, and his effort has paid off tremendously. Another thing that makes this movie a masterpiece is that; you don't even need to be familiar with the original story and film to enjoy it, all the groundwork is established right off the bat, and the characters develop much deeper throughout the course of the film, that you feel as if you know them.

It might surprise you, therefore, to hear that I've never seen the original Mad Max films. Maybe it was Mel Gibson that put me off (I never thought he was a good actor, although I did really enjoy How I Spent My Summer Vacation). Anyway, I feel it gives me the objectivity to properly address the merits of Mad Max: Fury Road. It feels like so much more than the sum of it's parts - it's certainly not Tom Hardy's best work to date, although he makes a sufficiently game Max, so the way is open for Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult to steal the show. Early on I found myself distracted by questions of how most people survive in this dystopian future, but the whole thing steamrollers its way across the screen with such demented fun that I soon forgot all about that. If you don't like explosions and lots of shouting, this might not be the film for you. Having said that, the mayhem is punctuated by moments of calm to make sense of the narrative, and when all hell is breaking loose (which is most of the time), it puts Michael Bay to shame. Shame on you, Michael Bay, why can't you make films as good as this? The budgets are certainly big enough.... Where was I? Oh yes, sum of its parts. Plot. Really, what plot? If it's plot your after, don't come looking for it here. I haven't seen a film with such a paper-thin one since, well, er...John Wick? Okay, not that long ago. But my point is still valid. Which is that there isn't much of a plot. But who cares when it's so damn cool? Also, see it in 3D. No really!

1439,23 May 2015,lewisLFC,10, One of the best action films ever made.,"'Mad Max: Fury Road' is directed by George Miller and stars Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult and is the fourth installment of the 'Mad Max' franchise. In this film, Max Rockatansky is captured by a warlord's henchmen and is taken to their fortress and is held captive. Once he escapes, he forms an unlikely partnership with former lieutenant, Furiosa, who is attempting to protect a group of people she cares for and return to her homeland. The action is superbly shot with no shaky-cam at all, it consists of wide-shots of chaos and anarchy throughout. This film is filled with relentless action and intense moments which are incredible. George Miller directs this film beautifully and with precision, so much so that I believe this film to be the best directed film of the year. The acting is excellent, especially that of Charlize Theron who portrays the persistent character of Furiosa. Tom Hardy is also great as the troubled character of Max who was previously played by Mel Gibson. The film is a non-stop action thrill ride but it also has a significant amount of feeling and emotion to it, especially scenes with Furiosa. Some scenes get really emotionally powerful later in the film. The film has an intimidating villain, a layered main character with intriguing side characters and amazing stunts. I well and truly loved this film. It is undoubtedly the best film I've seen this year and is easily one of the best action films I've ever seen.",

For the most part this is true, but in the last two previous films he was only part of a larger story. I also couldn't see anyone but Mel Gibson playing the part of Max, despite the damage he had done to his career in the decade before. It was unthinkable for another actor to take his play.

The visual aspects, and the special effects are out of this world. However, what reviewers seem to be forgetting is that visuals alone do not make a great movie. The only thing we know about the two main characters is that they lived a bad life and were being used as slaves. The movie follows these two characters which we know nothing about on a car chase for 2 hours, that's it. That being said, the movie felt like a car ride to the beach with relatives. Little dialogue, and not leaving the car for two hours. I believe they may have left out a back story to the characters so that they have material for a prequel in coming years. If you like a well developed story with characters that are developed this is not worth your money at the theater. 7.5/10",

The direction is incredible and the screenplay is all over the place but the amount of action and character development more than makes up for a story that is incredibly hard to follow and doesn't make sense at times. The casting and acting are incredible especially by Charlize Theron as the first truly human female superhero and Tom Hardy as Max but a much more real human max in a sense but a war torn survivor who is not the hero of the story but still an important piece to the story. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.,

Why so many critics and viewers here, alike, are so enamored over the film is beyond me. Miller CAN still hold his own when it comes to apocalyptic carnage, whether dealt with a front fender, a sawed-off shotgun, or a hideous looking blade, but that's all I can recommend to potential viewers of this film. Save your time and money, folks, and rent/stream some of the previous Mad Max films instead. Better yet, have your kids dress up in some old rags and face paint and ask them to re-enact a scene or two of Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. That would REALLY be entertainment!",

Action/chase scenes are gorgeous and created by real master of it's occupations George Miller. After all these year when you think what is going to be next perfect and moving movie you would not expect action, science-fiction movie to deliver it. From cinematography to every little detail all people that worked on movie thought about everything. Furiosa is such a strong character that fights and stands for something that it's just beautiful to watch her in every scene. Max played by Hardy huh? Hardy proved to be one of best upcoming actors that can play anything, just remember Locke, but at the same time no Gibson and you won't be disappointed because Hardy made even better job.

Because in most movies, action is only for the sake of itself. Maybe, this is the first time that character building has been done through speed action. At least it is that the first time that it worked out. So, what went wrong, not getting an Oscar for best screenplay, best directing or best picture? For what I can say: There is not much talk in that movie, but to me, still too much. Talking injects a kind of civilization, that did not match the behavior of the lunatic tribes. Another problem: The action scenes are so complex and one scene transforming into the next. It must be nearly impossible to manage the overview during directing and editing. And you can see it - sometimes the scenes don't fit correctly on one time arrow. This irritates. Another criticism (which is not fair, because the movie is so great anyway) is the overblown happy end. Way too much collective salvation at the end! All in all: huge effort by George Miller taking all the risks and trying to make an impossible movie. Ah yes, and Mad Max is incredible entertaining. The stakes are high for the next Mad Max. At least for Tom Hardy it should be possible to do better. He is a great actor and made 5! great movies 2015. It would be nice, if Hardy can manage to get more into the character of Max next time.",

However there is a major flaw to this movie...Can you have a hero with zero or next to non existing personality? A major part of the movie is underway before Max utters an inconsequential monosyllable. The previous character played by Mel had strong emotional conflicts that force him to deal with external threats with decisive yet necessary violence. The Max zombie in this movie seems like a robot with no idea of where or what to do unless he is told. One expects that eventually he would wake up, but to no avail. Sorry but the Mad Max I and II had a very definite character that we learned to understand and love.

The first 15 or so minutes were energetic and intriguing to say the least, unfortunately, there after, all expectations were not reached. Yes, for an action film the intensity was constant, graphics incredible and scenery immaculate, leading me to understand that those who love action genre must have been quaking in their chairs. However, i don't wish to be demeaning, but for those of you who are rating this above a 9 scale must have never watched a truly incredible film. We grow no connection with either Furiosa and Max. Tom Hardy, one of my favorite actors, was given very little to do, speaking about 10 lines overall. Having achieved a connection with the audience in most of his other films such as lawless and Batman, makes me believe that it must have been George Millers fault that we don't grow this link with him. The wives of Immortan Joe begin to annoy me, resulting in little sympathy and Nux, well, hes just there. The People Eater and The Bullet Farmer appear from no where and have no relevancy and the guitarist was painfully embarrassing, almost making me squint every time he came on screen.

1491,28 May 2015,jgunsenhouser,9," Thank you, George Miller for Fury Road and thank you in advance, for the next installments","The Road Warrior on steroids...at 70, George Miller's still got it. This put F&F to shame when the majority of the automotive action is real, and I'm still not quite sure after seeing FR in 3D, how Tom Hardy did not get seriously injured with some of the stuff he did. All the action was searing and you can see cinematographer John Seale's fingerprint on everything...Miller and Seale can truly shoot a real, REAL action scene and put the camera in places it probably shouldn't be able to go. One highlight for me was the uber-dramatic, phenomenally scored sandstorm scene with its flawless CGI integration...the CGI is there but the seam is invisible. This scene literally had me eyebrows raised and saying, ""These storyboards must've been fun to plan out"" The integration of the FX and the live-action footage is truly at expert level. (Sorry, Marvel...but you can always see the CGI in your movies and we always know where it starts and ends) I simply cant say enough good things about MM:FR, but I'll try...Tom Hardy apparently signed on for 2 more MM installments under Miller. I can't imagine what Miller has planned for us next but with George Miller, we should be ready for anything. One thing that really sticks out for me is that for the viewing my wife and I went to last night was rather small, our auditorium was only half-filled but after the last shot finished and Directed by George Miller appeared, everybody at our showing clapped for a whole minute...that didn't happen at either Avengers or F7. This movie has changed the action genre again, but this time, to a place where movies have never gone...directors not wanting to shoot scenes the easy way, but the best way. Most directors will incorporate the digital work for a whole list of reasons...George Miller takes that list, burns it with a lighter and blows the ashes away with a leaf blower. He doesn't use CGI to make it easy, he uses it to turn the already jaw-dropping into the absolutely eye-popping. Using CGI so perfectly and so minimally, you don't know where it is or how much there is. You watch any superhero movie or F&F movie and you can see where the digital work is...here, don't even bother looking. And that's where George Miller takes us, to a place where we know it's there for about 2 seconds, but we don't know where it started and finished and we don't care at all. As good as F7 and Avengers were, there was a lot of areas they could've been better...George Miller not only goes to that place but now he owns it and he doesn't have to give it back.",

They kept out-doing themselves with how many ways they could bring down or blow up the opposing vehicle. And for some reason, I cared about Charlize's character as well as Max. The bad guys' costumes were so bazaar they added to the fun. The bad guy leader . . . . didn't he ever get too hot for that getup? But while watching I did have a problem with how their situation could exist: 1. There were two scenes where they gave the thirsty crowd water.

What actually happened was that in the first minutes I was blown away by this amazing film!!! I never believed That it would be this good but it was. The film goes on a confused and tyrant spiral as we see the socially inept max having to join forces with Charlize Theron character who is Badder than Bad and action packed. She is saving the sisters who only exist to be bred for babies in this apocalyptic thrill ride. There are also insane sites such as a baby being pulled out of his mothers tummy with a knife and a man who is living on oxygen through a crazy and disturbing mask. To be fair just watch for Nicholas Hoult as the Wonderful Nux who adds the comic relief and tragedy to the film. What A day What A lovely Day!!!",
1496,21 January 2020,Dello_,8," Fantastic action, but maybe a little too much","""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a great action movie with a spectacular technical department. Indeed George Miller was fantastic because all the scenes are clear and thrilling, and some of them are very memorable. The score is also inspired: frenetic and tense and it surely enriches all the action. But the most impressive thing is that almost every choreography is realised through practical stunts and this is particularly important because the movie has a a grounded and ""realistic"" taste because of this practical stunts and in doing so it raises the level of the tension the viewer can feel. And finally I liked all the performances and the characterisation of the main characters. I found pretty solid the idea to give Max a little backstory so he can be perceived as mysterious and intriguing and I found him very cool.
The only problem for me is that there is toooo much action. Clearly I want to see action if I watch ""Mad Max"" but I would have preferred a little more time spent on characters's interactions instead of almost 110 minutes straight of car chasing. And this was a problem for me because I found myself bored when these scenes were longer than 25-30 minutes. And probably it is only a problem of mine because maybe I can take only a few action at a time but sometimes I was bored and I can't hide this aspect.
In general ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a more than suggested movie, very frenetic and with a fast pacing, great visuals and music, that can be boring in some parts but it's not a very big deal: if you are searching for adrenaline in a movie this is a great choice!",

The world of 2015 is a vastly different one from what was the reality of 1985 when the last Mad Max was released, let alone 1979 when the first one first hit theaters down under. During that time, came a noticeable change in what film audiences expect in front of their screen. While the 1980s was arguably the peak of action packed films (The early 90s being a top contender), the movie going public today is much more comfortable with zany comedies or drama. The constant bombing (no pun intended) of action film after action film at the box office gives only further evidence. Of course there are exceptions to this and one could point at super hero films but that is quickly becoming a genre in itself. But pure action, is nowhere near it's peak.",

And Max is not even the main character! It should have been titled ""Furiosa: Fury Road"". Worth seeing once, but not a classic like The Road Warrior.

1530,17 May 2015,agblum,8, A Good Thrill Ride.,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"", is the 4th film in the Mad Max Series, from Director George Miller, and the first to be released in 30 years. It takes part in a post-apocalyptic future,, where humanity's survivors are battling for life-saving and potential life resources such as gasoline and water. The movie stars Tom Hardy, replacing Mel Gibson in the title role in the previous movies as ""Mad Max"" and Charlize Theron as ""Imperator Furiosa"". I have heard that this film takes part in between the 2nd Film –""Mad Max: The Road Warrior"", and the 3rd Film – ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"". Prior to this, I had only seen the first film - ""Mad Max"", which I admit, I did not like, partially because there was practically no explanation that it was an post-apocalyptic setting, which I believe was explained in the next movie. Long story short, the action sequences – all in the form of action taking part in or around automobile chases, is indeed first rate. In terms of the story - I had heard you had not needed to see the others, but it would give you depth. My gut tells me that seeing the 2nd film, would have increased my enjoyment significantly, particularly as the film is not too Dialogue heavy in the about the first half of the film so. With that mind, the action sequences make it a fun thrill ride, and the actors do well with what is given. When I get a chance to see the other movies, I will certainly revisit this one, and it may improve. For now - 3 ¼ Stars out of 4 Stars – 8 ¼ out of 10 Stars.",

Mad Max's intro did not reveal who he was, or how he got there as it was only about 5 sentences revealing that the world was chaotic. Sure, I get it..but why was it chaotic? The post apocalyptic civilization and culture was little appreciated because the director failed to establish the premise of their existence.

This movie was one of the most incredible films I've seen this year. Aside from ""The Man From UNCLE"", this movie ranked highly on my personal favorites list. Tom Hardy is one of my personal favorite actors, and like the majority of his films, this one was extraordinary. The old Mad Max's lacked something this one put together. With multiple action scenes, a thoughtful plot, and a SUPERB cast, this film notched all the checks for me. To me, Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, and Nicholas Hoult played their roles to perfection. If you want to purchase a movie well worth your time, and the likely $20-$30 price range, this is it! I highly recommend this movie. RATING: I give this movie an 8.5.10, and I was constantly entertained when watching it. AGE: Even though this movie is rated R, I would say 15+ for this film, purely because of intense violent scenes. VERDICT: This movie was an adventure from start to finish, and I would definitely recommend this film.",

Another thing was that it had way too many guns, in the first film there was one shotgun; in the second one there was two guns, a shotgun and a pistol.

1580,19 November 2018,KidWithOpinions,9, The Most Bad Ass Best Picture nominee since forever!,"Mad Max:Fury Road is George Miller's latest installment to the Mad Max franchise. I would give it an A, for how entertaining it was, and how well the story was made.
Mad Max: Fury Road is the most bad-ass Best Picture nominee since Martin Scorsese's 2006 crime movie, The Departed. When I watched Fury Road the first time, I had no idea that it was nominated for Best Picture. This movie was nominated for Best Picture! That is insane, I mean out of all the movies they nominated, that was one of them. I am not mad, in fact, I love the fact that George Miller gets another shot at an Academy Award. This is the best Mad Max movie, according to everyone in the general population, and to myself.
What I think is nice about the Academy nominating Fury Road, is that if you are anything like me and your goal is to watch all the Best Picture nominees, then you know that all you are watching are super depressing dramas, and every now and then a dramedy ( but remember that a dramedy is still a drama). So it is nice to take a one movie break and watch a movie that is filled with violence and gore, and scenes of intense action. So when they nominate a war film ( that is rated R) it is nice because half the time it is just people killing other people. It is entertaining.
There was nothing in Mad Max: Fury Road that I really hated. The acting in it is good, it is well done, and it is entertaining as hell. What is there not to like. I will say that there is not excessive amounts of violence in it, so if you go in expecting that you will be disappointed. But all the violence in it is bad enough that parents wouldn't take the family to it, I will tell you it is nothing like Beyond Thunderdome.
Fury Road reminds me of literally every Fast and Furious movie, and I think you can understand why. It also reminds me of 2017s crime drama action movie, Baby Driver, I think you can see why ( yet again).
To recap, I think this is the most bad-ass Best Picture since ever. I give Mad Max: Fury Road an A, for how it was entertaining as hell, and how well done the story was.",
1581,6 December 2015,moviescriticnet,7, A movie that can only be described as post-modern and cyberpunk,"This remake of classic B-movie Mad Max (1979)-the movie that made Mel Gibson a star in one day, is George Miller's attempt to re-film the first (and best known) film of his career with a budget thousand times bigger than the one available in 1979.The result is visually impressive. Absolutely grotesque good and bad heroes fight for gas in a post-apocalyptic future society in a movie that can only be described as post-modern and cyberpunk. The exhilarating action is so intense that even the rotten tomatoes critic got curried away and gave it an almost perfect score (97%). Tom Hardy (known for Inception and The Dark Knight Rises) has become the next big thing in Hollywood due to this remake. Charlize Theron (an absolutely top actress overall) is simply great in the post-feminist role of Imperator Furlosa. Nevertheless, as one might expect, the fight for gas idea, which was original, innovative and to the point in 1979, has not aged very well and seems quite ridiculous today. Still, the movie is top notch as an action film with some very funny moments and you will remember it for some time, not for it's non-existent deeper meanings but for it's overambitious and grotesque cyberpunk environment.",

To all the whiners and soft-bodied movie critics out there, know this; Mad Max has always been about action, fuel, chrome, punks, fast cars, spikes, super-charged engines and bad-ass guns. It's as simple as that. If you want anything else, go hire The Notebook. I remember watching Mad Max 2 as a kid and walking out totally shell shocked at the roller coaster ride I had just been through. Only Star Wars came close to embedding itself into my subconscious in such a way. Back in the late 70's and 80's, post apocalyptic movies and shows were common. It was a cheap and easy setting for directors to create. All you needed were old factories, dry landscapes, a few rusty barrels and barbed wire. That's pretty much what Mad Max is, but in Fury Road you can add a dash of nitro. Mad Max is the king of post-apocalyptic adventure.",

On the other hand, Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) could easily be the second best of the series. George Miller knows his stuff and delivers great action sequences, very cool ones, indeed. The action and Charlize Theron performance are the very best of the movie. Tom Hardy is a fine and intense actor, but he is not a Star in the level of Mel.

The characters don't say a lot but you can tell what they're thinking about by just looking at ttheir faces. The action was intense, even the cars and outfits they were wearing were interesting to look at. Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) is a glorious film that puts you in a world that is far out of society and gives us the most insane effects and moments that shock you and make you pumped at the same time. However, it is still a flawed film, here's why. There were unexplained aspects like the people in the swamp area or the flashbacks Max had. It's more or less open to interpretation for the viewer. I at least see the flashbacks as the people Max let down and the swamp people are...just weird. I honestly never figured out what they were. The story was also simple. Thanks to Nostalgia Critic on Channel Awesome, I figured out that the story was only a chase. If you look at the film the theme is there, and it can be either seen as genius or potentially lazy. I find it to be something with good intentions but kinda of a weird outcome. However, a lot of the aspects and characters in these story make this movie worth it to watch. 9/10.",
1604,30 May 2015,sanwit,8, Grim never looked so good,"Fury Road brings jaw-dropping dystopian landscapes, and you gotta hand it to the people who dreamed them up. The first storm sequence of the movie which Furiosa enters on the large gasoline truck is just WOW! This movie is about a very grim future, but boy does it look great! Hope hasn't looked so good, and despair so sickening. Theron's Furiosa is a driven individual with hope, hope for a home where she was born, the land of the Mothers. She is one of the prize breeders of Immortan Joe. In fact, all women have been reduced to just that in this world. Furiosa escapes with the rest of Joe's prize breeders, and we get this chase of a movie. I personally favor movies with CGI that blends with the environment so much so that it doesn't look like CGI anymore, and Mad Max Fury Road achieves that, and I love it. Good performances all around also help. Hugh Keays-Byrne's Immortan Joe is adequate and played with appropriate fury! Theron's Furiosa drives the movie, and the parts that she doesn't, Tom Hardy's Max and Nicholas Hoult's Nux take up the job. Overall, a great movie, definitely worth a watch.",

The sets are good to. The whole set is just a desert, but that's what makes it good(after all the film is set in the apocalypse) The Villain is pretty cool to, he had a lot to do in this film. By the way i must warn you that this film is crazy. There are psychotic people everywhere in this film. For example, there's one part in the movie where the camera pans over a guy on a massive truck that is playing a guitar, and when he plays it fire shoots out of it.....enough said. The movie is sorta short on story, but when it is directed in a way that makes it fun and action packed then your going to have a great movie. So i really like Fury Road. It had great action, intense moments, and great direction. This is easily the best film of 2015.",

1613,10 January 2016,kjarvis1212,10," ""Perfect In Every Way!""","When it comes to George Miller's rip roaring, pedal to the metal action powerhouse Mad Max: Fury Road, the question truly is whether or not it's the greatest single action film ever made. Miller, who of course directed the original Mad Max trilogy that helped launch Mel Gibson's career into orbit, picks up right where he left off by creating a barren, unforgiving desert wasteland, inhabited by a variety of gangs and tribes in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic world. The movie begins with our hero, Max (Tom Hardy in a brilliant, likely career-changing role), looking out over the desert, thinking about his former life as a cop, and how he's haunted by the souls of those he wasn't able to save. Without warning, Max jumps in his rig and speeds off into the sand, only to be chased by a pack of shirtless, skin-headed marauders, or ""War Boys."" Max is captured and brought to the Citadel, where the larger than life, scary as hell ""Immortan Joe"" looms over his clifftop perch to deliver a booming message to thousands of peasants. He's sending crews out for supplies, bullets, and so forth, and he wants to see them off in style (apparently). This is where we meet Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who is leading one of the convoys in her imposing ""War Rig."" But as the journey begins, Immortan Joe discovers that Furiosa has taken something from him that she does not plan to return, and all hell breaks loose. Before long, Max and Furiosa become reluctant partners as they struggle to survive a full- throttle, fuel-injected game of cat and mouse. To call Mad Max: Fury Road an action picture isn't even really doing it justice. Consider the most intense action film you've ever seen. Now multiply it times 10. I'm serious. I love me a good action flick, but I've never seen anything like this. Of course there are some effects that are undoubtedly CGI, but from what I've read about the production of the film, a surprising number of the unreal, heart-pounding action scenes were actually performed by actors and stuntmen. Take for example the scene in which Immortan Joe's posse has just about caught up to Furiosa. Leading the pack is a knucklehead war boy named Nux, who we're led to believe is dying of a fairly common but deadly blood disease. In order for Nux to do this without getting sick, he needs a ""blood bag"" or, in this case, Max, chained to the front of Nux's rig with a blood line literally intertwined through the chain links. Furiosa sees a sandstorm up ahead, and heads straight for it. The buildup to this scene, and the way the action unfolds on the screen as the chase rockets into the storm, are film making at its finest. Action cinema does not get better than this. Now, it would be one thing if we were simply lured in by groundbreaking action sets and scenes. But where this film really delivers is the emotional connection it creates between the viewer and the protagonists. There is a cautious but healthy respect between Max and Furiosa, especially as they each come through when the other needs them most. By the end, we believe in their bond, and perhaps our throats even tighten up a little when our two heroes acknowledge each other with the simplest of gestures. The cinematography is also of the highest order. We get a real sense of place and scope of the environment the story takes place in. Ariel shots that gradually pan downward upon a frenetic chase scene are extremely effective, especially aided by a thundering soundtrack that in some cases is literally part of the action. Make no mistake; Mad Max: Fury Road is that rarest of rare treats, a landmark film that will undoubtedly set the bar for the action genre for years to come. To put it simply: ""perfect in every way!""",

There are no real stakes because you don't care about the people in this movie or what happens to them. All the characters have almost no defining characteristics, emotions or goals. Everyone talks like a child, spitting quotes or in some cases just grunt their way through the movie.

The acting is solid and complete lack of story and character development just could not be better. I will be forever in debt to the deftness with which Miller's addition to the Mad Max corpus honors every aspect of the satire genre -- completely coloring within the lines of vapid meme rehash, endless regurgitation of thematic tropes to cue audience to his earlier work, while at the same time cheapening and satirizing the Mad Max arc to a degree to which pales in comparison to Lucas's utter destruction and posthumous capitalistic Disney rape of the the past two installments of the Star Wars franchise.",
1627,10 March 2016,visharl,8, steals your breath every minute.,"Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the vivid movies of 2015. The cinematography for this film is an absolute marvel- showcasing the sprawling outback desert through hues of oranges and reds during the daytime, contrasting it with beautiful midnight blues at night. All this comes together to give the movie a very lively atmosphere. The score alleviates the sense of rush and is smartly used diegetically as well as non-diegetically. The action scenes are shot brilliantly with minimal special effect, furthering its case as a masterpiece. Finally the acting especially that of Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa is top-notch and no character is left needing further characterisation. Tom Hardy's Max is a man of little words, but the performances are so strong that the movie doesn't need dialogue in order to flourish. This movie is definitely not hyped up- go see it and then go see it again. This sequel and reboot of the classic action franchise brings Mad Max soaring vigorously back to life with a two hour action extravaganza that puts everything attempted in the original trilogy to shame.

That being said, it really seams like the director/ writers are trying to promote a social agenda. The whole movie is about the women being the action heroes. In fact, there are a number of scenes where Max is helpless, being saved by the women. I have nothing against the women thing, but the main action hero should not have to constantly be saved by the costar. Its not as simple as just ""who's more hard-core"", they actually built the entire story about woman fighting against the men who are all bad except for the two ""good"" guys in the entire movie.

To see society falling down towards our lesser selves is apparent to anyone watching and this film tackles everything. The action is beyond superb and the visuals are mind boggling stunning -- amazing how Miller has created a sub genere similar to Blade Runner where the follow up films in the coming years can only hope to emulate and find their own footing. What a phenomenal film! Charlize as the lead is perfect and I love to see people get a glimpse into the idea that women dont have to fight only women -- we can suspend disbelief that a man misisng his dog can ehad shot 100 people in NY but somehow we have to be realistic when a woman fights a man..stop it!

1650,27 July 2019,Cinemagoer77,10, Miller's Magnum Opus,"My world is fire and blood. George Miller went full maestro mode. This is one of of those films that Miller was probably dreaming about for 40 years. This is a film in which his visionary concept is fully realized. He interweaves high octane action scenes throughout an unforgiving aussie post-apocalyptic world and it never comes off as unneeded or over done which is something the fast and furious franchise suffers from.
Some of the vehicles are battle armored v-8's that resemble metal beasts of hell. Some of the older films I am sure suffered from budget constraints and you won't see many vehicles lacking here.
Even though the movie is a big chase scene filled with Miller's stylized action the movie never loses it's humanity or soul. ""Out here, everything hurts."" These aren't shallow protagonists. Max suffers from ptsd. Furiosa isn't just an escapee. Everyone has suffered except the psychopaths. The reasons and motives make sense in that mad world.
I still respect Mel as Mad Max and I also see Hardy as Mad Max. Can you imagine someone else playing Rocky or Conan the barbarian maybe? Rocky no, Conan yes for me. Replacing actors is not an easy feat to pull off and coming from a super mad max fan, they pull it off right away.
The dialogue is minimal but catchy and appropriate to the scene. ""Say bye bye to the neck!"" Instead of ""you're dead meat"", is fun and memorable. You will never hear the word mediocre the same again. The manner in which the main villain labeling something mediocre to boys is hilarious. What a bully.
There is directorial genius to George Miller's mad world that can't be seen in any other action films and it isn't for everyone. It is an action masterpiece.",

Music, camera, action, actors, screenplay, environment, details and total crazyness of everybody on the screen. What a lovely day! Miller really did a nice job even on film tricks and stunt actions.

1655,30 May 2020,kangarooconnor,8, It's not The Godfather guys. So stop treating it like it is.,"This movie is good. Simple as that, people who are looking for Shawshank redemption (which happens to be my favorite movie of all time) in this clear mindless action film, are only hurting themselves. The point of this film is that it's supposed to be mindless action. Max helps furiosa get some women to safety while being chased by a cult of monster truck loving, Valhalla worshipping, crazy people in and apocalyptic desert. It's not gonna have philosophical moments of what it means to be human, or amazing changes in heart. The movie is good because of three reasons, great main characters, amazing visuals and interesting action sequences.
The characters all have a reason to do this. Max helps because he has no where to go but forward, they helped him so he'll help back. Eventually coming to kinda care about their cause. Furiosa, angered by her forced labor and evil captor seeks to help five women leave their abusive master. And a brainwashed boy comes to realize that his ""savior"" isn't really all he had thought. They have a reason to do something, not some BS philosophical mission.
The visuals are excellent, (I watched both the original and the silver and chrome edition. In which the movie is in back and white. I heavily suggest you skip the black and white version, as, although benign good, loses some of the magnificent color and graphics of the regular version.) The visuals bring out an excellent feel to the wild apocalypse.
The action is also excellent. Outrageous yes, but look at the ones perpetrating it. Crazy, brainwashed, idiots with no regard for personal safety. Of course the actions sequences will be weird and outrageous. They at least are interesting and cool. The aesthetic to the cars and guns and suits is all unique and interesting.",

To dislike this film, which is subjective at the end of the day, would make you part of a small majority to say the least. I went to see Mad Max: Fury Road with little to no hype for it. Its true, i have seen the trailers and while i was enjoying each new piece of marketing material that i saw i was never truly excited. When i heard the reviews, however, i made sure to see the movie critics were raving about. It was something completely unique and awesome to behold. Not only did the director of the original Mad Max return, at the old age of 75, but it was a revival of a long dead franchise with a substantially high and risky budget that was pretty risky considering how dead the franchise is. Everything about this movie is amazing.

Starring the also unknown at the time, Mel Gibson. Who much like Harrison Ford in Star Wars released only 2 years earlier, was the lone star of the film to make it big in Hollywood. Mel would go onto become on the biggest names in Hollywood throughout the 80's and 90's while director George Miller fell into obscurity, maintaining a presence as a working Director, but releasing radically different films like the animated hit children's film Happy Feet. I didn't have the highest hopes for Mad Max: Fury Road when I first got wind of it some 4+ years ago. I grew up as big fan of the original Mad Max trilogy as my dad is a huge fan of Mel Gibson.

And it's well done action even if a little repetitive after a while. So, if 100% action and adrenalin, in a dark&dusty design is your kind of flick, then it is a 10 out of 10. Therefore it is understandable that it stays in the moment at 8,3 because many just seek for nothing else. If you expect a bit more, like deeper going characters, dialogs, acting, story etc, you will be disappointed because there is absolutely none of that. Sure, action movies are not made for that in the first line but I saw good stuff combining story and action. The ""non"" story here bases itself, as so often, on the fact that people need to go/drive from point A to point B and making here a lot of noisy and crazy stuff when doing it. But hey, this picture goes even a step further....they go as well the same way back !! Wow. That is genius. I did not expected any real relation to the 1st and one and only Mad Max (even if the unrecognisable Keays-Byrne was one) but I did hope to get more from Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron. Damn, they can act, certainly Tom Hardy can..... But that's business and Tom Hardy knows it but I do hope for him that he is not ruining his career. Younger audience will be impressed by the action, score, design etc, but anybody who likes cinema for people acting around a story...they will go home empty in there heads.

I will first say that this movie is not for those looking for strong character development. A lot of the characters develop in a ""show-and-tell"" manner and not with deep, evolving stories. On to the characters: Charlize Theron is amazingly bad ass as Furiosa. She's a great female protagonist who is not about the male fan service. In fact, this movie is full of strong female characters. Max serves as more of a side character in comparison. Tom Hardy's portrayal of Mad Max was as close as the original as I could have hoped for, but I still believe Mel Gibson captured the cynical, self-serving nature of Max's character better than Hardy. Overall the most impressive male character was Nicolas Hoult as Nux, the war boy who was raised for one purpose: to fight and die for Immortal Joe, the main antagonist and warlord of the Citadel, who goes on to betray Joe and help Furiosa and Max. Joe, interestingly enough, is portrayed by the same actor who played Toecutter, the main antagonist from the first Mad Max film.",

Definitely some looked like they suffered radiation burns. Be that as it may, this movie had very believable characters. Both protagonist and antagonist had depth, sensitivity, emotion. Even though the main bad guy was tyrannical leader Imortan Joe, you could kind of empathize with what he was doing. I especially felt moved when he held his dead wife (one of them)in his arms and he was genuinely saddened. I felt for Imortan Joe, his cause was noble, he was a family man (a dad,) he had to make do with what he had, he had to ration and control the water, he had to maintain and harvest the crops, he was trying to produce superior human beings so that they may have the strength to lead. In order to establish a society emerging from a wasteland, to speed things up, you don't have time for democracy, you need slaves. These slaves all seemed like happy slaves. Probably because there was food, shelter, they seemed cared for. The backgrounds in this movie were so believable, the action sequences top notch edge of your seat non-stop.

The war rig has more personality than Furiosa. The story is shallow and formulaic; the dialogue stilted and witless; the villian one dimensional; the action cartoonish and repetitive. A stark contrast to the raw psychological energy of the original. Are contemporary filmmakers prohibited from creating authentic stories with nuanced, fully formed characters? Are audiences too conditioned to twitter, tiktok, fb, etc to maintain the attention span required of innovative films?

The backdrop changes colors with the mood. The action feels spontaneous and inventive as vehicles explode and skinheads fly through the air like acrobats. The primary antagonist is a decrepit megalomaniac who monopolizes the water supply and literally milks and breeds women while driving his fanatical minions to self-destruct. To make this all less tawdry, his captive wives discover feminism and escape with a butch heroine, her posse of old biker chicks, and a romantic sap named Nux. Max helps guide the lost ladies to their true utopia. That, in a nutshell, is Mad Max: Fury Road. Sure, there's more--cretins with distracting deformities, a midget, a pregnant woman with an exposed belly, etc.--but none of it really matters.

In a world ran mad, by the mad, due to a reduction in the worlds oil the thought on the minds of everyone is simple...survive! In a beautifully shot opening, which is consistent throughout the movie, Max is chased down by cult leader King Immortan Joe's (Hugh Keays-Byrne) men and imprisoned in there citadel. He is used as a blood donor for half-life war crazed Nux (Nicholas Hoult) who wants to die historic on a Fury Road. While Max is locked up Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is sanctioned to lead a gas run with a convoy towards Gas Town. On the road to Gas Town Furiosa takes a detour and Immortan Joe discovers that his five wives are out of there chambers and Furiosa sets the road she is traveling on a furious course. The King in a desperate anger leads a historically wild and large war party to retrieve his ""property"". Nux, wanting to make a name for himself and to impress the immortal, sets out to lead the ""rescue"" with Max chained to himself so he can continue to receive his blood which gives him strength. The first of many absolutely breathtaking action scenes ensues between Furiosa's rig and Joe's army in a sand storm with tornado's and all sorts of ""lovely"" natural elements. Nux drags Max into this mad sandstorm in pursuit of Furiosa's rig and declares it all as ""a lovely day"". Lovely...this is maybe not the best word to describe the surrounding events for Max, but for the viewer...one of the straight up coolest and jaw-dropping scenes ever filmed. The intensity captured and maintained throughout the movie is sheer brilliance displayed by director George Miller. The whole film in its most simplistic form is just one big chase scene, but the execution and characters make this film so much more. The movie throws you right into the story like so few successful movies have, but the acting gives these characters such depth. Hardy, Hoult and most of all Theron are so effective in a movie that is more about the ground breaking stunts and beautifully sadistic film making. Hardy, like in many films doesn't talk very much for a main character but gives a fully expected performance marked by controlled brilliance. Hoult, as Nux gives energy and surprising heart to Mad Max: Fury Road in his quest for hope. The theme of hope is rooted in this film, Nux's hope began in an attempt to please cult leader Joe in battle and ended in a quest to help those he was originally out to kill. Theron as Furiosa was a gem and gave a strong women character that at times stole the show from the titled character. Passionately ran by redemption, Furiosa fights for those oppressed by this cruel apocalyptic world.",

If you like action, you will love Mad Max: Fury Road. The movie is a constant car chase that is never boring. George Miller's use of practical effects brings a level of realism to the screen that recent action movies like The Avengers and The Hobbit failed to create. I haven't shown it to my friends yet because of our busy schedules but they are already tired of hearing me talk about all the great things about Mad Max.

This ""Mad Max"" is heavily anti-white and anti- European racist. Indeed, whites are pictured as fagots, insult Valhalla. I even spotted that the degenerates have a black and red banner which may refer to the flag of Ukrainian volunteer battalions, who at this moment fight Kremlin's invasion in Ukraine. The degenerates in the movie call their paradise ""Valhalla"". I suggest the word ""Valhalla"" to be removed. Because it is used uniquely in brainwashing purposes, to engrave negative associations with European culture in the brains of the cattle-citizen. There are also other propaganda messages. Otherwise, the movie is entertaining. There is a lot of creativity in the design of vehicle and action scenes.

1740,15 January 2016,bscrivener-50810,9," A Fast, furious, adrenaline fuelled thrill ride!","Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2015 action movie directed by George Miller, the mastermind behind the Mad Max franchise. In short, Mad Max: FR is a high octane, no holds barred action flick with epic set pieces and fast cars. In long, Mad Max: FR is another look into the now legendary Max Rockantansky's insane world and his struggle to live, fight and survive in it. The originals were often considered some of the greatest action movies ever made and Mad Max: FR shines and blows our mind once again. From the devastated nuclear landscape to the high speed, high adrenaline fuelled road war and to the surprisingly vast amount of both character development and emotion, ranks this once again as one of the all time greats. The movie never lets up right from the get go, huge Michael Bay style explosions, brutal, gritty fight scenes and giant chases. Tom Hardy fills the shoes of the legendary Max, a role he portrays with great depth, his quiet, stern and seemingly mysterious portrayal certainly make him one to rival Gibson as well as a fantastic supporting cast with equally insanely 'mad' characters played by Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult and Hugh Keays- Byrne as the terrifying and power hungry villain, Immortan Joe. My only flaws with the film is a slight feeling of repetitiveness and slightly unsatisfactory villain confrontation in the third act of the film, also a very unmemorable soundtrack with no real scores featured to accompany the mayhem. Overall however, Mad Max is a fast, furious, adrenaline fuelled thrill ride filled with beautifully shot action sequences, accompanied with intriguing and exciting characters in a phenomenal action adventure. 9/10",

This movie lacks storyline and purpose and all the effects whilst entertaining becomes a bore fest after an hour. The characters are lame and the humour lack lustre. Tom hardy is a great actor but this was not his finest hour. The guitar player was hilarious but apart from that it all seemed rather pointless. I won't watch the next one simply because I believe it will be more of the same far fetched scenarios where it would be impossible for anyone to survive. If you're gonna do a movie remake then don't think special effects are all that matters. I'll stick to the classic version with fantastic Tina and Mel.,

But looking at the intense action scenes in Mad Max - Fury Road it is hard to believe that no one was hurt or severely injured. It made me want to see the movie in 3-D. Tom Hardy has some big shoes to fill & does a great job but I have to admit he is upstaged in almost every scene by his co-star Charlize Theron. She plays Imperator Furiosa & she is the star of the movie. Poor Max is just along for the ride. There was a strong female actor in the last Mad Max movie - namely Tina Turner. Nicholas Hoult is also a stand out. The photography & music are excellent. Many of the scenes were filmed in the African country of Namibia,

The Black & Chrome edition does enhance some scenes, but is overall inferior to the regular edition. The scenes where the image is sharp is better looking in B&C edition, while the rest of the movie looks better in color because the image is softer. I think the softer images are the product of using software to artificially reduce the shaking. This isn't noticeable in the regular edition because of high contrast color. On the other hand, instances where the images are sharp don't look as good in color because the extremely sharp images with high contrast are distracting -- this isn't a problem in B&C edition.",

1763,23 May 2015,commercialaviation101,9, Eye-Popping Entertainment,"Mad Max: Fury Road is admittedly a pretty tricky film to analyze post-viewing. I will preface this review by saying this is one film to see on the absolute biggest screen possible. The action alone merits an eight-star rating. I will admit that most times I take the meticulous CG effects and practical wizardry of movies nowadays for granted, but it's worth saying that my jaw physically dropped during two or three of the film's action sequences. No doubt, it would be an understatement to say that George Miller has an eye for staging action. My only gripe, and it certainly doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the film, is that the movie is mostly lacking a compelling narrative hook. Before the inevitable comparison is made to 2013's Gravity, which was almost entirely propelled by the absolutely out-of-this-world action, I should say that the characters are much more interesting this time around. Charlize Theron is very good as Furiosa, even while her arc feels a bit forced. Nicholas Hoult is lots of fun as Nux, and Hugh Keays-Byrne plays a very solid villain. But, I must say it was Tom Hardy who really stole the show. I don't think I've every heard less lines from the supposed main character, but that's what really made him special. Otherwise, Junkie XL's score was absolutely electric, and it makes me very excited to see what he's got planned for Batman V Superman. The cinematography was very good, and perfectly captured the on-screen excitement without having to resort to the ""gritty"" hand-held style favored by lots of filmmakers nowadays.",

1765,18 September 2015,tariq-hossenbux,8," Blood, Sand, and Car Chases All The Way To The End","There have been many who wrote negative reviews for this film, but I think if you start watching Mad Max with the right frame of mind, you will find it worth watching. Set in post apocalyptic Australia, it features stark but stunning landscapes of sand and craggy rock. Tom Hardy as Max and Charlize Theron as Furiosa are excellent and very believable as people traversing this gritty and violent world in search of something better. Hope and redemption as the film puts it. Through blood, gunfights, and car chases they try to stay true to their hopes for a happier future. Best seen on a larger screen to take in the scale of the vistas and the numbers of vehicles involved in the battles, but still very impressive on the smaller screens. The gigantic but empty landscapes highlight just how small they are as they continue on their quest, and also how small their chances of success are. The film at times has a theatrical quality almost like a Shakespearean play as the individual characters reflect on their situation. The battle scenes are elaborate, and almost circus like sometimes. You will get your fill of car chases, guns, and blood in this one. But besides the action Mad Max makes an effort to fill out the backgrounds and hopes of the main characters. These days you don't find that attention from every Hollywood film. Mad Max powers through with the steady pace of an 18 wheeler and you will get a steady supply of action to keep you interested till the end.",

Because Fury Road was meant to stand alone, there's no need for the audience to know all of the nuances of the Mad Max mythology to appreciate or understand the story here.

That said I do feel a lot of the reviews have lost most sense of proportion about it. It is a fascinating shotgun marriage between Miller tastes and contemporary blockbuster narrative tics (same could've been said about the much reviled Beyond Thunderdome back in 1985 too). Big widescreen action fits Miller's formalist tendencies rather well and the big desert chase offers plenty of variation of space exploration for his gaze. At same time there's some rather unnecessary dead time developing character and trying to find some relevance to them that feels rather alien to Miller (the flashbacks that haunts Max are particularly awful) and despite the film pleasing lack of self-references there is a smug too satisfied of his own crazyness attitude that wouldn't be out of place on Furious 7. Old pro Miller keeps things moving and never let the small setbacks stop the film momentum much, even if this is the longest film in the series by some 20 minutes, despite a very lean plot (it is still a good deal shorter than most current blockbuster and never becomes a slog which sadly is something to praise by now). That said this is the only Mad Max film that peaks early probably because is the only one that actually acts like it believes it is building towards something while previous entries just accept its collapse of civilization motif and let it fuel Miller anarchist post punk imagination. There is a curious upward mobility quality to the Mad Max films, every time Miller revisits this universe the world around Max has become more spare and devoid of any recognizable trace of civilization while Miller's budget and by consequence the bombastic quality of his action scenes goes up and Fury Road just push that idea to the limit. One rare gets to watch a big budget film like this that look so personal (of course same could be said by Wachowski's Jupiter Ascending and that got tons of scorn) so I get the appeal, I just think it operates under a much narrower frame than some of the biggest raves suggest. Still, outback opera cum chase pictures don't show up all time and summer blockbusters don't get much more pleasurable than this.",
1781,6 June 2015,nepeta,7, Finally a commercial film without lots of sexism,"I liked Mad Max, not because of all the adrenaline and special effects and the oversimplified plot typical of action movies, but it's one of the very few commercial films I saw lately that didn't spoil my enjoyment because of abuse of sexist traits. In this film a woman is an active and strong character and she doesn't wear high heels, make up and sexy clothes, she's even disabled and had her head almost shaved. The young women in the film that we can say that look more like what is considered pretty nowadays were also not full of make up and uncomfortable clothes, they were just young and fresh and they also helped a lot to solve problems in the film. And the hero of the film wasn't only one super strong man, it was the team work of different people with different genders and skills that could achieve a goal. There's no disgusting age gap between the characters that had a crush. Tom Hardy is even 2 years younger than Charlize Theron. Charlize Theron is turning 40, the age that many actresses are considered rubbish. And there was a group of older female bikes that were good warriors. And this film gave an important message that people should unite despite their differences and fight the real common oppressors.",

I love the non-stop action and explosions. It just left me speechless. I don't even think it's right how amazing it is. I loved Tom hardy and Charlize therons performances in this movie. I loved furiosa and the guy with the guitar and the warboys. Immortan Joe was an awesome villain. Tom hardy played a way better Mad Max then Mel Gibson. I really think Tom hardy should get a Mad Max trilogy. Nux was an awesome character. George miller is a genius. Normally action sequels that come out a long time after the original don't do to well but this was released thirty years after Mad Max 3 and it was perfect. This would be my second favourite movie.,

Movie starts, and within few minutes, the movie gets too much tense. All those cars, oil-trucks, motorcycles create a great havoc. And it was enjoyable throughout. But, sometimes, mindless action sequences get tedious. After watching the movie, I felt that characters were not much developed. I wish I could know more about the protagonists and antagonists. And the fight was too much against the odd which I didn't like that much. In Batman Begins or X-men First Class, we can see initial development of the story, which seemed lacking in this movie. But anyway, action sequences were great to watch, and if you don't use your brain too much, you would enjoy without any problem. I wished a better story, few memorable dialogue, and some kind of believability in the script. Casting seemed good overall. Giving rating ""7"" for great action sequences.",
1788,16 November 2015,IsaacSage,9, 4.5/5,"If the world ran out of oil, gas, and water. If it transformed into a giant desert where humanity soon devolved into savage killers...who would truly care about furthering the human race? Who would try their best to find a place to live permanently...to rebuild society for the next generation? George Miller(director of the previous 3 Mad Max films) makes an argument that it's the women. It makes sense when you think about it, women get pregnant, men don't. They have a certain maternal instinct that could drive them to make the world better for their children, while the men go crazy(in the case of the film's villains) or drift aimlessly from place to place(Max himself.) This is why Imperator Furiosa(Charlize Theron) feels like the main character. She drives the film forward(figuratively and literally) while Max(Tom Hardy) simply drifts along. The fact that Max is an extra in his own movie isn't bad, and it's not entirely new. As a character, he's not that interesting. He gets to engage in a couple cool moments, but mostly he's just a haunted shell of a man, his mind fixated on the past. In the film, he is captured by the pale, bald-headed forces of Immortan Joe, whose evil empire has found a way to control water supply, bringing thousands of people to his mercy. Max finds an opportunity to escape, when the aforementioned Furiosa, a soldier working for the bad guy, tries to smuggle Joe's concubines out of his captivity, and to a mysterious ""green place"" across the desert where they can be safe. Also along for the ride is Nux(Nicholas Hoult) who gets to have a couple sweet and funny moments along the way. What follows is not just a 2-hour long car chase, but an exercise in visual storytelling. The Mad Max films have always taken inspiration from Chaplin and Buster Keaton according to George Miller. At times, Fury Road feels like a silent movie. Even with the thumping soundtrack, there's almost no talking, and when there is dialogue...it actually isn't exposition. A miracle in itself. The film treats it's chases not as thrill rides, but as art. The thrill comes later. Each chase is like a line of dominoes, getting longer and more complex by the minute, and by the time they all collapse, you're left thinking ""how are they gonna top that?"" What's more remarkable, is that they keep doing so. I'm not going to list action scenes, because that's boring and pointless. See it for yourself. In a culture obsessed with continuity and ""expanded universes"" it's refreshing to see a movie where it just doesn't matter. Miller has said that Mad Max is an anthology, but it really doesn't matter. People arguing whether this is a reboot or a sequel...where in the time line it fits in are missing the point. It doesn't matter. Have I said that enough? Fury Road hearkens back to simpler time when people watched movies and enjoyed them for what they were. Much has been said of Theron's Furiosa. She's feminist propaganda...she's a strong female role model...she's a character made to pander to women. No no no. She's just a character. A strong character driven by maternal instincts and bravery. She's one of the best characters of the year. Not female characters. Not male characters. Just characters. Hardy doesn't really get to do more than grunt and whisper, but he does that pretty well, and his presence already adds enough gravity to the film. It's also visually stunning, with 90% practical effects. I'm going to say that again. 90% PRACTICAL EFFECTS. Overall, Mad Max is a film that demands to be seen. It yanks it's audience with it on a thrill ride that doesn't stop, and leaves your mouth open and your heart beating hours after you leave.",

I've seen it about eight times because I keep recommending it to people and then sitting down and watching it with them, but I'm still not tired of it. In this movie, Max takes a bit of a backseat to an indomitable amputee and her companions, women from the harem of the local creepy old warlord. Furiosa is not the only powerful one either—none of these women are helpless or one-dimensional. Tom Hardy delivers a stoic yet truly impressive Max with something like 43 lines. The world is what I love most, though. George Miller creates several utterly unique, colorful, fully-formed cultures, and he doesn't waste the viewer's time with backstory—he assumes we're intelligent enough to figure out relevant details and the rest is up to our fully piqued imaginations. Though the action is non-stop, it never gets boring and drives the plot rather than distracting from it. Plus, bonus points for a lot of practical effects instead of relying mostly on CGI!",
1791,20 May 2016,kaorisakakibara,8, Marvellous,"What a beautiful piece of modern entertainment. Although George Miller decides to completely abandon any narrative structure, and apparently didn't even have a script but just a storyboard when he started the project, he has crafted an energetic, character driven story that simply interests you from the first to the last minute. Charlize is absolutely brilliant. But it's not the individuals, it's the powerfully orchestrated summary of all players and elements that makes Fury Road an instant classic. I especially loved the music. The original Max Max films somehow got lost in the style and stardom of the 80ties. Fury Road translates the franchise into a 21st century context, while at the same time preserving the essence of the original. And probably good choice not to re-cast Mel Gibson. Chapeau!",

Max Rockatansky was perfectly portrayed by Tom Hardy who had big shoes to fill after Mel Gibson. Max did not feel invincible like many of the other characters in this movie. This made everything just more realistic. I enjoyed the fact that Max was again portrayed as a man who is trying to survive in the brutal wasteland created by director George Miller. Max really does look ""mad"" in this movie with the images from his past haunting him throughout the movie. Imperator Furiosa was another bad ass that really focused on trying to save the human cargo. The Immortan Joe was gross and terrifying and I couldn't love this character even more. The way he portrays himself as a god was a big part of the story and character development. The action was amazing and in my mind this is the best action movie of all time. If not that then at least the best action movie of the last fifteen years. This film definitely surpassed the previous best movie of the series, Mad Max The Road Warrior. The reality of this world was frightening, but was so awesome that I felt I wanted to be apart of it. The cars alone was something that drew me into the wasteland. The fact that so little is left, but they can make so much of it is an important part of the world. The madness of the war boys was completely insane and crazy and that is what a Mad Max film is all about. Overall, this film is a great action movie that should be watched on the big screen. I had a great time watching this movie and can't wait to return to the wasteland and for Tom hardy to come back as the words greatest survivor.",

I think a film like Gladiator had the right balance between a good story and some great action scenes but for me personally Mad Max Fury Road misses being a classic because the plot is too simple.

1813,16 May 2015,gbee30,6, Meh...,"After seeing this, it apparently doesn't seem as if much has changed in 30 years. OK, It obviously has a bigger budget than any of the last 3 movies combined, and it looks visually stunning. Unfortunately this movie comes across as a standard Mad Max adventure and really isn't much different from Mad Max: The Road Warrior (1982) or Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome (1985) with Thunderdome being the most ambitious one of them all. The story to this one is very similar to the Road Warrior, starting pretty much in the same way. As the story went on, with the movie essentially being just one big chase scene, I found it rather boring and I saw myself dozing off since all the visuals I've seen done before much better in the Road Warrior 33 years ago with real practical effects and no green screen. Most of the movie to me was just a regurgitation of old visuals and ideas I've already seen. I would've preferred to see Mel Gibson return and see the evolution of the character 30 years later. So to me there was nothing new about this movie. Now even though people say this is a reboot, there is obviously a sense of continuity from the last 3 films, it just comes to figuring out where this fits in. It definitely appears to be a direct sequel to the original Mad Max (1979) since he still has a working Interceptor, the one sleeved leather jacket and the leg brace. Even at the end of the movie you can believe that he somehow recovers the Interceptor and restores it before the events of The Road Warrior since the Interceptor is totalled halfway through it.

Tom Hardy plays Max (formerly portrayed by Mel Gibson), and Charlize Theron takes second billing as Imperator Furiosa. The majority of this film involves vehicle chasing, which most die-hard Mad Max fans will appreciate. Dozens of souped-up, industrialized, militarized, and modified vehicles tear up the desert with a mix of explosions, gunfire, and flame-throwing. The ongoing train of mechanized war machines are painted against a picturesque desert scene filled with dust storms and lightning flares. As with the earlier Max films, craning and tracking camera shots keep the action up front and intense. Even though Max is the title character, the film's secondary themes are those of fertility, paternity and maternity. Max has very few lines in the film which allows time for these secondary themes to take shape. Much like Thunderdome, Fury Road deals both with the innocence of the young as well as the desperation and conflict of the old. This latest entry is probably the best of the series. Highly recommended. Do you smell that? It's aerosol inhalant and diesel fuel...and this is Fury Road.",

1833,25 May 2016,J-fuglen,10, Mad Max Sure Is Mad!,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is the fourth Max Mad movie directed by George Miller. Different from the other Mad Max movies, this one follows its own storyline and does not have any associations with the previous movies in the franchise. I will be honest, when I chose to watch this movie, I had no idea it would be SO DAMN INSANE! I mean, I had watched the trailers and seen what I was about: an apocalyptic wasteland, where law and order no longer existed and the only thing left to do is to fight for your own survival. I was just not prepared for the insanity almost every character seemed to show. I mean, even our own protagonist Max does not think clear, which just comes to show the world really had gone mad. If you have seen any clips on YouTube from behind the scenes of the movie, you will know how little CGI that were used to film the crazy car-chase scenes. To see how much effort George Miller went through to make each scene look almost exactly like the ones shown in the movie is a big plus in my book. For the characters: Tom Hardy did a solid job as Mad Max, but he could not have done it without the assistance of Charlize Theron as Furiosa, who did a fantastic job in portraying a strong female character. The movie could have been called ""Mad Furiosa"" and I would have been fine with it. In addition, Nicholas Hoult's character also did a great job, and the same can be said for the movies main antagonist ""Immortan Joe"". Even though he had a mask on that would hide his facial expressions, it was easy to see in his eyes that he wasn't playing around. It was like watching Tom Hardy as Bane from the Dark Knight Rises – you could feel the horror from the look in his eyes. The movie is not filled with much dialogue, but the scenes in the movie that involves the most dialogue is great to watch, and shows good character development. But the movie shines the most is at its crazy, over-the-top action scenes, that are gold to watch. I just wish I had seen the movie in cinema, because this really is a movie that deserves to be enjoyed on the big screen.",

The directing, acting, cinematography, music all work in a symphonic precision to deliver one of the most fun and enveloping cinematic rides I've ever experienced. And I love movies. (If you couldn't tell yet.) And I love big movies. But so many ""big movies"" are brainless and forgettable. Not this one. George Miller knows his format with an insight shared by few in his industry these days, and this film is a brilliant showcase for a faceted career in story-telling on the big screen. It literally is a ""moving picture show"", and I hope that this film serves to reinvigorate an interest in audiences to see practical special effects and real stunt-work in Hollywood films.

I don't want to leave out the other cast members especially Tom Hardy,Zoë Kravitz and Nicholas Hoult, they were all equally amazing.After seeing this version of the movie I went home and found the previous versions of this movie on demand.

It's not Michael Bay-crazy, but has some of his tendencies. It was enjoyable at least, and the 3D version is nice. It is a popcorn flick, so take it for what it is. Mad Max 2 it ain't though.

Hardy is excellent in the role of Max, if anything he should have been given a more prominent role, with Furiosa taking most of that glory, but I can see why Miller did it, and when the going gets really tough it's Max that comes and takes it to another level, so it really bodes well for the next chapter on the Mad Max series!

Also, this is the most gun-accurate movie I have seen in years! I'm pretty picky when it comes to firearms in movies and get peeved easily at them. This movie did everything right! Proper nomenclature, gun manipulation, and no added cocking sounds! Whoever managed the firearms on set knew what they were doing. They clearly shoot guns and know how to use them.

You really enter the world of three characters in this film. ,

1883,12 October 2015,Hala93,10, Best movie 2015 until now,I watched the trailer and i felt its boring cars following each others and in the desert with no stopping but then when i saw it i guarantee it will be the Oscar bet . Its about who you are ? what you are looking for ? to what you will reach ? how much you will sacrifice for salvation ? when you will awake from the dependency stray ? it put you in front of your self any asking you all of this.If you watch it as a pure enjoying with no meaning you will not like the movie unless you like chasing cars movie. The best thing is the soundtrack in action movie Best visual effects Best performance by actress . It was very enjoyable and interesting.,

Ok, this description doesn't sound very appealing...What if I told you that this truck is being hunted by crazy fanatic guys guided by a demented leader in a post-apocalyptic desert?

With a voyage and return plot, it flips the parts a bit around and becomes a unique piece, while stile being blockbuster action with a basic story on the top layer, making it a film even a kid would really like, not that kids should see it of course. It puts the experience of the protagonists on the edges of experience, and it is not often I have been so dragged into the drama we see our heroes go through.

It has a good premise, great acting and a lot of topics to tackle. Post apocalyptic world, cult dynamics, gender issues, personal redemption and it tackles them all quite well. At a lot of times, I forgot that I was watching a Mad Max movie or even an action movie, till the well crafted explosions reminded me. The story isn't quite new, but well made and serves the events right. The issues presented at the movie are quite great and it made me ponder a lot into a lot of issues, deep and profound ones. The stunts and visual effects are great. It could have used some more mundane tasks drama (e.g. resource management,etc..) but that never seemed to be quite a hindering point to the movie.",

You inhaled at the opening credits - and then exhaled at the final. Literally. Well, ok. You got me guys. Of course, one cannot stop breathing for two and a half hours.

Fury Road takes us in the middle of the one of the biggest havoc you have probably seen on the big screen. Yet it has everything the ordinary public could expect from the long waited brand new chapter of our beloved Mr Very Mad Max. To be straight and clear, lets cut off all of these mumbo-jumbo complaining reviews, lowering Mad Max's rate very (i mean VERY) inequitably. Its not the best option to see Mad Max if you are a very feminist, Stanley Kubrick's or Woody Allen's fan or some sort of self called critic with aspiration to find really deep envoy, showing us the right way to be. Coz Fury Road is beyond all of that. It was no intention of its director to face any existential problems so if you are looking for some solutions to deal with them-spare your time, your money and don't spit on the movie you probably didn't give a chance from the first minute. Its above your frustrations (just like Max's fans). ",

True, I am not a connoisseur of the original Mad Max movies, but that doesn't mean I don't know a good movie when I see one. Fury Road is definitely not all action and explosions! (Though they are present from start to finish) the movie also has it's serene and meaningful moments. These are always accompanied by stunning visuals and amazing cinematography. What's almost more impressive than the film itself (almost) is the making of it, with all cars and explosions being practical and the concept art reaching back 10 years.

It can be gruesome for those who do prefer soft romance and chick flicks to actual horror and adventure movies but nevertheless, it has created something exciting. And what a cast, the Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy combination is really spectacular to watch on screen. I have not seen previous Mad Max instalments so I am judging this movie purely on its own originality and performance.

In spite of that, this movie made me so uncomfortable - especially that highly intense opening scene - that while I can say I definitely appreciated the movie, I did not enjoy it.

The characters though are kind of bland and I didn't have much emotional connection to the characters but you still have a strong enough connection to where you care whats happening on screen. The only characters that kind of annoyed me were the wives at the beginning, they get more tolerable towards the end. Tom Hardy is also good in this movie, but it still funny that he is always wearing something on his face in his movies. The score is a bonus, it's really good, you feel the urgency in the action scenes where they have to fend off enemies from their vehicle. Another amazing thing about this movie is the world, everything feels dirty and dry, it does feel like there is no water in this world. Mad Max is a must see for any action fan but also a must see for a casual movie fan. Mad Max Fury Road 8.5/10.",

1905,28 September 2018,Ze_Gypsy,10, Fury road is nothing short of a masterpiece.,"First off, let me start off saying that people who are giving this movie one star and claiming that it's mindless action, is not only wrong, but mindless themselves. 
It's true that Fury Road is a movie that can be enjoyed without thinking too much, its also true that's its a movie which has required an INSANE amount of work to produce. There are so many details in the movie, that one could watch it ten times and still discover new things. Its a visual masterpiece and probably without exaggeration the best looking action movie ever made. 
to people claiming that its not well written, that is partially true. This movie wasn't written, it was story boarded - but writing good action sequences is one of the hardest thing to do as a screen writer and this movie has one amazing action sequence after the other. The plot is simple, but works. A henchwoman rebels against a tyrannical leader and frees his concubines and a chase ensues. Its a minimalist plot, but it works brilliantly.",

Characters who are genuinely sympathetic no matter how strange they seem at first. 3. A well-thought out, intricately detailed and consistent world which is certainly no real world that could exist, but is a perfect embodiment of the mythic Mad Max universe. 4. Technical perfection. This is one of the most beautifully and expertly made films I have seen in a long time.

The unique landscapes, vehicles, costumes and characters add to the sheer greatness that this film has achieved. With the lack of both dialogue and slow paced moments, this movie gives you little time to breathe as every scene is action packed and intense. The acting was tremendous as well, as Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron shine in their roles as Max and Furiosa. I can not praise this movie enough, but I will conclude by saying that George Miller has proved himself as a cinematic genius with Mad Max: Fury Road.",

Isn't it amazing how much fun can still be had with a movie that isn't much more than trucks chasing each other (and, here and there, explode in a big ball of fire)?! It goes to show that a dreamlike quality - in this case a nightmarish one - can go a long way compared to so many movies nowadays that are too talky or that are just too much like literature or even more often like the comic strips they were made of.

Paul Walker, but even though I like the F&F franchise, the story line is well, not strong. The action sequence of Fury Road resembles a lot like Death race, but well it suits better in a post apocalyptic struggle of War Lords rather than in a locked up prison race betting business. Tom Hardy seems to own every action sequence he does. The movie is epic, mind blowing and lastly very refreshing for the action genre.",

1933,10 September 2015,merlin9877,9, More than an action film done right,"This movie ranks in my best action movies, and I haven't said that in a while... The thing that strikes me the most is the art direction. George Miller and his acolytes have created a very coherent universe that not just looks impressive, but is very believable (in the sense that it all fits together not that it could really happen). You feel the desperation of everyone, you taste the sand from the desert that gets everywhere and you understand the struggles such a dystopian society faces. Secondly, kudos for the fact that almost all the female roles in this action movie have clout! These gals can hold their own and then some. They give very good performances, even the secondary roles which I thought would be very weak. When I saw the ""breeders"", I thought they would be the cliché Barbie dolls of the movie. I was very pleasantly surprised to see these girl models can rub elbows with the other stars of the movies and contribute to the creation of the substance of this film. And later, with Furiosa's tribe, these older women had real character! This probably fits all very well because of a great script. A script that could feel a bit clunky on paper but is masterfully brought to life by Miller. As for the two main actors, the restraint that Tom Hardy shows or the boiling temper we sense in Furiosa are outstanding. I guess that since Miller created this universe starting in the late 70's helps. And it shows that this director started out before the CGI era. The stunts are absolutely spectacular. I thought I was back in the 70's with real car chases and explosions. Miller goes all out to bring a fabulous vision of a twisted future and, believe me, he achieves it 100%... 9/10",
1934,28 February 2016,utimategamer,10, Best Action Movie of the Decade,"Mad Max: Fury Road is the continuation of the Mad Max franchise that started in 1979. It is directed by George Miller (the director of the original Mad Max films) and stars Tom Hardy as Mad Max and Charlize Theron as Furiosa. Now this movie is one of a kind. First off, this movie is ACTION-PACKED and it never lets up. The other Mad Max movies have been known for their action sequences and their craziness but never before has it been so fleshed out. Fury Road has the best action sequences ever put to film. The thing that makes this action so awesome is the fact that George Miller made sure that most of these sequences were practical effects. That means all the stunts and all the explosions that you see are real and that is just awesome. Another that I mentioned how crazy the Mad Max franchise is. All the Mad Max movies (except the first one) are taken place in the apocalypse, where oil and gasoline are precious resources. As you can imagine, people will start going crazy and in Fury Road, it gets really insane. You see some of the weirdest, most over-the-top characters that are just insane. Some people might find it too insane so when you see this movie, you need to know what you're getting into. I also have to give props to the direction of this movie. George Miller took his old franchise, reignited it, and introduced it to a new generation. The performances are also great. Charlize Theron as Furiosa is probably one of the greatest female heroines in film. She embodies her character and she is arguably the main character of this movie. Tom Hardy as Max is also really great in his role. Lastly, I think this movie will stand the test of time because of how re-watchable it is. I've watched 4 times not and it never gets old. If there's anything bad to say about this movie, it would be what other people have said. The movie doesn't have a lot of plot or character development and that has detracted from other people's feelings about this movie. Me personally, I don't think it needs it and that the movie is already Amazon without it. Overall, this is not only the best Mad Max film. Not only is this the best action movie of the decade. This is one of my favorite movies of all time.",
1935,15 September 2015,billylarrick,10, A revolutionary new take on action films,"The film may be called Mad Max and it may start and end with him, but anyone watching soon realizes that Mad Max is actually about her with Max providing the vehicle (no pun intended) for her story. It is she who is trying to free the birth mothers and take them to ""the green place,"" her story of redemption for past sins as much as Max's redemption, and she who the film's villain, Imortan Joe, is trying to kill (in fact Joe never so much as acknowledges Max's existence at any point during the film.) Charlize Theron's performance is a refreshing defiance of the typical female role of helpless love interest and shows that a strong female lead playing an emotionally scarred, physically tough character can be just as believable as male actors. This film, and Charlize Theron in particular, left me wondering why more films don't have stories written for strong, independent women if characters like Furiosa are the result we can expect. ",

1939,28 May 2015,jaykelly-94449,9, Masterpiece,I would recommend this movie to everyone it really is like nothing I've seen at the cinema before. The movie is just a 2hour long car chase but its so much more than that. Tom Hardy gives a brilliant performance without actually saying much and Charlize Theron who is the main character in many ways is equally as spectacular. The plot is very simple the god guys are being chased by the bad guys but the action scenes are shot beautifully and watching Hardy and Theron in action together really is amazing.,
1940,13 August 2018,ohad-84719,10, The greatest action movie of all time ever made in human history,"I remember first watching this movie on the big screen in IMAX 3D. My eyes and my head were really hurt on that day but it was worth it.
On the 13th time watching it ,this film is truly a huge masterpiece. Everyone call other movies such as Aliens or Terminator 2 as the greatest action movies including Die Hard from 1988. I defiently agree with them but Mad Max Fury Road is the greatest action movie ever made.
From the first shot until the end ,this movie is just an incredibly powerful chase which never stops for a moment but it really has deep story and thought-provoking themes.
Tom Hardy replaced Mel Gibson but Hardy is awesome the same as Gibson ,let's not talk about the incredible Charlize Theron.
The villain made me chills and nightmares every time he was on the screen.
Powerful incredible action sequences, amazingly beautiful cinematography and visual effects and of course the talented cast.",

1943,30 December 2015,camolan,10, Loved it,"Despite a great cast and top acting, here the vast majority of the credit goes to a monumental direction. When I started watching this masterpiece I had no idea what I was in for. As I always religiously do with any movie, before ""pressing play"" on my DVD player, I had avoided to read any review on the movie: other people's opinions are often influenced by those people's expectations and in turn risk to influence my expectations and my judgment. Besides all the expert's opinions and seasoned critics' views, what after all matters the most to me is the answer to: ""did you like the movie?"". I did, very much so. I vaguely recalled the original Mad Max. But after watching this ""4k UHD movie"", all my memories seem like an old fading Polaroid picture. Spectacular action sequences, amazing special effects, a futuristic medieval background and an out of this world (somewhat Turneresque) photography left me begging for more. Mad Max: Fury Road: a visual feast, strangely romantic and brightly dark. Thanks George for the ride!",
1944,19 October 2015,PurePolonium,10, Simple yet elegant.,"This film is no Memento when it comes to plot, and Max only makes a few appearances but I am not complaining. As a fan of the original Mad Max trilogy I honestly did not have high expectations when sitting down to watch this film, considering that very few new continuations of franchises are good. However...George Miller has outdone himself, and I applaud him. The editing and pacing flows and the action scenes are so spectacular that they would make any director jealous. This movie is a simple film with an idea that everyone working on Fury Road has stuck to and improved upon vastly. This film is definitely a worthy addition to the Mad Max franchise and I look forward to future installments.",

I never had a problem with this major push in cinema to propagate that narrative and MAD MAX-FURY ROAD is an example of that 'what if' its the women who end up saving humanity. In my life as a young male i have witnessed much destruction from the males in my life and it is allways the women whos strength and nurturing perseverance that save the day. So i say bring it on. Visually this movie has to be seen on a big screen, I saw it first on my tablet and have since seen it on a mates larger screen. Absolutely amazing.",

1949,7 November 2016,manuelwinchester,8, The greatness of an action monologue,"The sequel to George Miller's trilogy is finally done. The new Mad Max film is here to prove that Miller is still one of the best directors worldwide. The plot is not something innovative or pioneering, but the scenery is enough to impress even the most skeptical. In a vast desert full of sand, George Miller sets his post-apocalyptic scenery which is about a rebellion against a tyrant, Immortan Joe. Actually, Miller set a motor orchestra, a war of vehicles on the humongous desert. Each action scene is a work of masterpiece. The details of direction are flawless, giving the impression that we've never seen something similar. Maybe we are accustomed to special effects and blockbusters, but here the level is definitely up. The action is exponential, in a point that Miller should have given some action-breaks to relieve the audience. But this is the main characteristic of Mad Max: it doesn't let us take our eyes away, not because we'll lose plot's continuity because the action scenes are delightful. I think George Miller had conceived his film as an action monologue. Well, in order to do this, Miller has sacrificed all his characters. It's a fact that he doesn't give a complete portrait of his characters, only some specific elements. For example, we never learn who is Max (Tom Hardy), the complete story of Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and many other clues, such as how the world ended. I think that's the one and only film's drawback. It would be much better if we knew more things about the characters' s background. There are also many other elements to bear that Mad Max is magnificent, as the six Oscars winning. The sound, the makeup, the costumes and generally the way the film is produced, indicate the overall great work. As for the interpretations, we didn't expect less from Tom Hardy, who is possibly the hottest name in Hollywood at the moment and Charlize Theron proves one more time that she can play in such movies any given day. Mad Max: Fury Road is extraordinary. A few words need to describe this film. If someone is looking for something deep and profound, then this is not what he/she should see. Mad Max: Fury Road is full of action from first to last and due to this is considered a great film.",
1950,30 December 2022,makusuimasu,9, Very fun and exciting action movie!,Mad Max: Fury Road is a movie starring Tom Hardy as the titular character Max Rocktonsky the color grading practical effects and design of the vehicles give a a very cool apocalyptic feel. And you get a very visually appealing chase throughout the film and Junkie XL's theme for the movie only enhances the movie. Along side its likeable (if not a little simplistic) Characters as well as pretty intimidating and cool looking villain Immortan Joe. Now to get on to a few things that may be turn offs for some poeple the movie can feel a little dragged out at times regardless of how well the scenes are made. And I feel like some may find the constant chase of the movie dull and find some of the minor side characters a little boring in the character department but (IMO) This film is a very well made action movie great for newcomers who can stick around for the ride and returning fans of the Mad Max series as well as fans of other such as Fallout!.,
1951,1 June 2015,cognitron,9, What other action movies ought to be doing,"I watched Fury Road and Avengers 2 within a week of each other, and the difference was like night and day. Fury Road is an exemplar of what action movies ought to be like, and Avengers 2 is an exemplar of what they're like instead. I'd written off action movies completely because of the trend toward roller-coaster-ride visual spectacles with huge displays of senseless violence and asinine plots. I'm glad I took a chance on Fury Road, because I got the exact opposite.",

1953,27 June 2015,vexicaus,9, Instant Classic,"In terms of an action film, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" hits with significant impact, blood rushing action, and brilliant explosions. It's use of ""actions speak louder than words"" takes it's double meaning to life. To some degree it may be considered the thriller necessary to open the eyes of the blind. Those who settle down for less and watch this will definitely be woken. Instead of a generic story line and mere predictability, it provides realism most haven't seen in it's dynamic rushing storyline. As every second, induces suspense within the atmosphere.

George Miller's labor of love was released earlier this year in May, but due to extremely unfortunate circumstances, I was unable to see it as intended: in cinemas. Shrunken down onto a 55"" television with a suitable surround sound setup, the film manages to offer an incredible experience nonetheless. Considering the genre at hand here, you know what to expect. Or do you? Miller has created one of the most exquisite action films I have ever seen, easily rivaling the likes of classics like Die Hard or T2. I'm being absolutely serious. I credit my intense appreciation of the film to many things, the first of which being the absurd amount of practicality. ",

That's cool, punk rockers seldom do either. I keep considering if I should click the spoiler alert button but it seems a bit pointless.

It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn't have much of a plot at all but seriously you're not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn't even need one at all.

It took so long that Mel Gibson could not longer be considered. Instead Pommy Tom Hardy was cast as Max and in this instalment he is actually not that Mad, but just determined to survive his oppressors. In a post apocalyptic desert wasteland where gasoline & water are gold, the cruel despot & ruler of the unfortunate masses is ""Immortan Joe"". (Played by the same actor as the villain in the original '79 flick). He imprisons women for breeding but also another rare commodity - their breast milk. Enter our heroine Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who is a rig driver sent by Joe to acquire a gasoline haul. However she has other intentions, that of finding ""sanctuary"" and with her sudden diversion a frenetic chase begins. And boy what a chase! Max at this stage is just a passenger. An ex cop, he is just used for his blood, transfusions to satisfy Joe's insane warriors. But Furiosa has a secret cargo; 5 of Joe's beautiful wives, all in it for freedom too. When Joe finds this out he is furious and with a huge convoy of monster cars, trucks, rigs & bikes the pursuit is on. Can Max be trusted to help Furiosa with her quest? Anyway, there is very little dialogue, but just enough to get the jist of the plot. The rest is amazing action, filmed on location in the Namibian desert & produced free of green screen technology. There are incredible stunts including a memorable sequence through a deadly sandstorm. It is LOUD: the vibrations & explosions rock the cinema along with an amazing soundtrack compliments of Junkie XL. As a movie fan JG thinks the unsung hero here is the cinematographer. He delivers the most incredibly filmed action chase this century. A sensational big screen experience folks....The Real Fast & Furious!",

The second time I watched it, I got into the details, the stunts, the characters, the locations etc. The fact that I rarely watch a film twice made me write this review. Try and see beyond the big scenes and look at the detail and scenes that make up the film, they are pretty good.

1979,9 August 2015,fionnanthomas,8, Good movie but needs to be longer,I liked the idea of this movie. Tom Hardy is excellent as Max and I hope he is in the next Mad Max movie. But I feel the movie could and should of been longer. It was the same for every other mad max movie too. Your at the edge of your seat the whole way through and suddenly it is over. The action is brilliant especially for the last 20 minutes but the ending was not great. I did not quite understand the way they left that city and then came back at the end. I also feel it should not be R rated. There was only one brief bloody scene at the end. Having said that it is quite a violent scene but I think it deserved a pg-13 rating.

It is excessive. Let's get that out of the way, and incredibly silly, but no one surely went into a film called Mad Max Fury Road expecting anything else did they? Yes the plot is pretty weak, we could pull apart some of the gender issues for hours but for what it is I found it massively entertaining and visually stunning. The main cons are; relatively weak plot (it is just a car chase for the entire movie), lack of realism (if this is always a con), poor acting from some (Huntington Whitely, Kravitz...) which may be down to the writing, and Tom Hardy is unable to shine. The pros are, it looks excellent, its incredibly fun if you can take it for what it is, and Charlize Theron is excellent. It is not a film for everyone or for all occasions but if you are going to pick an action blockbuster this is as good as any. On occasion I felt like it was trying to make some sort of political point but then more explosions happened and I forgot about it again.

Mad Max: Fury Road is a reboot of the franchise from the late 70s/early 80s, but knowledge of the original films isn't necessary.

I look forward to more of our new Mad Max's journey, but will be happy having been able to experience at least this journey, if it is to be the last. Beyond Thunderdome left fans wanting more. I never felt like it had left as satisfying an ending as it could have had, such as our recent BatMan. Mad Max deserved this renewal or even this ending. Tom Hardy is Mad Max, just as Mel Gibson had been, and would have continued had so much time not passed. This feels like a continuation of excellence.

The camaraderie and assumed equality between Furiosa and Max is a refreshing, riveting, and adds greatly to the believability of the narrative. The visuals are a stunning operatic event.

Mad Max Fury Road is a two hour action masterpiece with thrilling stunts, incredible vehicles, and disturbing costumes. The action sequences are wonderfully executed. 95% of the special effects are practical giving the film authenticity. The film is edited with fluid feel while simultaneously keeps you anxious and uneasy. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron play the leading roles. Their unique on screen chemistry magnifies the tense action. Nicholas Hoult is a sleeper in this one! George Miller held nothing back and provides a new take on an over saturated genre. If you can't feel adrenaline coursing through your veins while you're watching Mad Max Fury Road... Then you are most likely dead.",
1994,18 May 2015,j_mcclennan,10, insane wonderland of brutality and Hi-Octane enjoyment,"As big Mad max film lover. This film had everything you wanted and expected from the franchise. Apocalyptic world, Big car chases with lots of destruction, crazed lunatics creating and using some truly barbaric weapons. The film shows the different types of people living in this savage world, different tribes which makes you want to explore this world that max lives in more. Good acting all round with no annoying characters like screaming helpless girls. Same Max, same look as we left him (although new actor) and some great little nods to the original films. I wish though Tom hardy would of tried to put on more of an Australian ascent rather than his usual bane voice.",
1995,15 May 2015,Mars4532,8, Must see,"Must see for action fans only because the stunts are captured without cgi. The story plot and dialog are sparse like the landscape, but the action is kinetic. It's really a refreshing break from all of the new school action flicks fueled by cgi effects. A lot of reviews are kind of over hyping the movie though. But when a studio puts in $100 million for a movie like this I need to know what they paid for. If you want to see a real action movie - no cheesy stuff - this is it. Music score is pretty good as well as cinematography. The pacing is just edge of your seat pulsating for at least the first 40 minutes which is kind of crazy in this era of filmmaking. It kind of just shreds up the basic arc of storytelling, and says let's just jump right into to it.",
1996,15 January 2016,bryanprzy,7," Bigger Cars, Bigger Guns and Bigger Explosions","George Miller continues the post-apocalyptic saga of Max Rockatansky (Hardy replaces Mel Gibson) after a thirty year absence from the screen. The historically violent series, which includes Mad Max, The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome, picks up Max's legacy with faster cars, crazier villains and a bigger budget.",
1997,18 February 2016,cute_but_spastic_owl,10, A frikkin masterpiece,"This film is the most beautiful thing you will witness. Ever. Flawless editing and an incredible soundtrack, George Miller gives us another dose of Mad Max's Wasteland in amazing style. The stunts are unbelievable, especially in an age when CGI is used far too much, and the film is basically one long car chase. There are plenty of awesome stunts and explosions to enjoy and the story can be enjoyed in a simple 'there and back again' way or on a much deeper level thanks to Miller's character development, excellent casting, and awesome world building. This film really plays with the visual side of story telling as very little speech is used, characters often using facial expressions and gestures to express their feelings and desires. There is so much foreshadowing and mirroring and intricate details (visual and auditory) that you'll only catch after watching it a few times over and the many levels make it perfect for textual analysis. 10/10 would watch 100x",
1998,4 November 2015,itsmebrad,9, Amazing!!,"Great movie!! If you get the chance to watch it, I would highly recommend it!! I don't want to give any spoilers of the movie, but it was outstanding. Watched it 3 times already and will definitely watch it again and again. Love it!!",
1999,19 August 2019,asteroidstopper7,10, One of the great action movies,"Mad Max Fury Road is a wild ride that is meant for multiple viewings in my opinion. Good performances by Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy as well as the rest of the cast, and in particular the daring action sequences and editing, make this story a truly enjoyable feast on the eyes and exciting. I liked the visual effects and was surprised by how well they were done, and better than almost all other movies with similar post-apocalyptic plots.",
2000,21 October 2015,harleywithers,9, wow,"what a damn good movie this was one of the best action movies in the last few years this movie was a crazy fun wild ride all the way few. These types of movies don't come often so seeing this was just god my lord it was good. The movie had some very strong themes of women which is awesome to see in movies like this were women are only seen as objects mostly. This movie should and better win a Oscar for something special effects, costume, hell even for best movie of the year if i had a say in the Oscars. This movie i thought was going to be a disaster but the way the action scenes were directed was great. Most of all the was little to no shaky cam which was great woo. .This move gets 9 out of 10 since still not movie is perfect and there always room for improvement.",
2001,5 January 2016,alishalee,8, Unbelievably entertaining!,"You will not believe the action that is happening before your eyes. Such a well written and scripted entertaining movie. It's fun, its enjoyable and its much more than watchable. Tom hardy seems to fit the role of mad max like no one ever has. Down to his tone, to his hair, the role really seemed to fit him. The most amazing car chase you will ever see. Furiosas Character wasn't so bad either. Wasn't fond of Rosie huntington Whitley nor Zoe kravits role but hey, it wasn't so bad. But just maybe if they found people who were not so known of already to play the role, we could have seen some fresh new raw talent. No complaints here.",

2003,29 June 2015,rickymarten-06511,9, Mad Max 2015 Movie,"I watched the original Mad Max 2015 Movie a few days ago with my friends. After the 30 year later, we finally see the release of the fourth Movie of George Miller's Mad Max series. This movie MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is the story of 'Mad' Max (Tom Hardy) and young women battle to survive in a desert wasteland after the collapse of civilization. Taking about series forward after MAD MAX: BEYOND THUNDER DOME, the Movie features Hard taking the torch from Mel Gibson, with a promise of a journey filled with action in unending deserts.But does the movie live up to expectations managing to please the action hungry audience as well as the geeky fan boys who have waited for this movie.",
2004,31 October 2018,dpeeacteh,10, Truly Awesome,"Fully loaded with action sequences, beautifully shoot; great acting and great plot (the one that we already knew). Didn't think they could make a remake this good but they achieved it.
It's good in any way that I can think of. The only thing that doesn't quite keep the good job is that the plot is more around Furiosa than it is on Max, but hey I can't lower my rating because of that.
Enjoyable for the whole family.",
2005,19 November 2017,rithvikrshetty-65659,9, Welcome to the Danger Zone...,"This movie gave me chills due to the thrill and excitement of the movie.The stress on doing the film more the of the old way (Meaning less CGI) really should be considered as an achievement due to the abundance of CGI used in movies in the past 1-2 decade.The first Mad Max is a under appreciated movie but this movie is in a whole new level,the soundtrack is out of this world and borderline amazing and character's performances were spectacular.This could have been a masterpiece and an easy 10 but the middle part of the movie was slightly stretched to my liking.Overall,after watching this movie you would say,""What a movie,what a lovely movie."". and surely not say,"" Mediocre "".",

2008,20 October 2015,jrh1,9, One wild ride but ALL about the cars!,"If you have a fetish for red dust, rust, heavy metal, V8 engines, monster trucks and motor-cross this is the perfect movie. To get to the point though, it is ALL about the cars. From the original movie Mad Max was one with the Interceptor. The development of the bizarre, Frankenstein vehicles since Mad Max 2 has built up huge audience expectation for what comes next. George Miller doesn't disappoint, and Fury Road shows every possible aspect of these breathtaking vehicles in all their glory.",
2009,8 January 2016,Shibbs1988,10, The Best Action Film of Recent Memory,"I was extremely hyped for this film to begin with. I have always loved the Mad Max films, i grew up watching them thanks to my awesome parents. This film lived up to the hype then exceeded them. Charlize Theron and Tom hardy are a powerhouse duo. It is easy to say George Miller knows his audience and went in literally all out guns a blazing. Mad Max: Fury Road is hands down the best film of 2015. Not to compare the two biggest blockbusters of 2015/2016 but, Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens did not even live up to the height cinematically or story compared to Fury Road. Mad Max: Fury Road will be immediately added to my collection and will remain amongst the rest of the greats.",
2010,28 April 2020,zuoyi-30439,8, worth to watch,"The story is very simple, just about a group of women try to find a suitable land to live. The best part is the design of all the kinds of cars and the scene of fight.
Charlize Theron is very cool,Tom Hardy is handsome,and the beautiful girl is so pity to die,and the most impressive is Nicholas Hoult, he was so miserable in the movie.
In a all, the story is worth to watch with complete story and perfect scene.",

George miller has yet again magically crafted a masterpiece which sets new standards for Action Genre Tom hardy his expressions , improvisations are just too good (some actors don't need duologue's to act expressions are enough ) hopefully he will be at par with Bale and Dicaprio one day. now Charlize Theron oh boy does she blows off the bad ones in the air and with style and bad ass action sequences she has proved that she is'NT just a star she is a great actress. Finally Nicholas hoult what a lovely day Indeed what a lovely day mad max fury road is An Epic in every Aspect .",

Right when you thought you were about to catch your breath it's insanity all over again, ecstasy at its most decadent. I can't even! The most insane action %*ck ever!!! Somewhat like inception was the best mind blowing screw that left you gasping for a hint of reality level beyond level. Like seriously!!! Beauty and grit, raw indulgent torture of unrivaled kind incessant, delicious beyond the tastiest of words. Juxtaposition at its finest. Infernal barren land on the brink of birth or at the very least the tenacity of a voracious appetite to survive, to live. Merciless rapture that leaves you writhing for more, scene after scene, yet simultaneously begs for an end to the sadistic euphoria.",

2017,7 September 2015,robar-4,9, Great action entertainment but lacks decent story,"Having worked with George Miller on all three previous Mad Max movies over 30 years ago I was really keen to see what he would come up with number four. Well, the lack of story was a little disappointing, but as a comic strip action movie it scores well. However, a two hour chase from point A to point B then back to point A was a bit pointless, and without some decent dialogue one just didn't care about the characters... Top marks to John Searle for his fantastic camera-work which provides a visual feast to compliment the spectacular stunt work....The hard task was to replace Mel but Tom Hardy does a decent job. Nicholas Hoult was great as Nux, and it was good to see Hugh Keays-Byrne playing the bad guy once again. (He played Toecutter in the original Mad Max film). Overall, this is an entertaining action movie that certainly delivers what it sets out to do, and should keep the action fans happy...",
2018,3 August 2018,kharden-44225,10, Nonstop Fun,"Mad Max: Fury Road is the perfect movie for any action movie lover. Mad Max brings nonstop action with the perfect mix of world building. However the movie does not put much priority on character development, however it makes up for it through all of the amazing things that this movie does throughout. With intense, really well done car chase sequences. Mad Max is perfect for any Movie lover that does not mind the quirky nuclear fallout world and events that happens through the film.",
2019,9 April 2016,kingn-98970,7," I actually really enjoyed it, but had more potential","I saw this for the first time the other night, and whilst i have not seen the previous movies, which i probably should have done, i really did enjoy this and was able to understand the concept of Max losing his child and wife, and having that haunt him. I think the let down of this movie was a lack of character development...although i thought Nicholas Hoult was very well done. It seemed as though everyone in the movie was just doing what they had to do, to get to the end of the plot and finish the movie, without seeing any real change or big connection between them. the story was kinda simple but it was easy enough to follow and understand, and personally i feel that whilst the action, CGI, practical effects and soundtrack were great, if the story was deeper, the characters were more developed (apart from Max of course) and there was even more blood and grit to it like an R rated movie, than this would be perfect. all in all, i think the ratings for it are well over what they should be, but i believe that the reviews on IMDb are drastically low. Mad Max: Fury Road is a fun film, and in entertainment terms, in my top 10 of 2015.",
