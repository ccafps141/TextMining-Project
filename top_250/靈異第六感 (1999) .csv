1,1 September 2014,rooprect,8," Even if someone spoiled the ending for you, it's still worth seeing","There are over 2000 IMDb reviews for ""The Sixth Sense"" so I don't think I can add anything that hasn't already been said. But in case someone has already spoiled the ending for you (like some dumbbutt did for me and the entire office back in 1999, causing me to avoid this movie for 15 years), never fear... it's still VERY MUCH worth watching.",r
2,31 December 2005,kylopod,10, An appropriate spoiler-free review,"The surprise ending to ""The Sixth Sense"" has gotten so much attention that it threatens to overshadow the film. I occasionally hear people say things like the following: ""The 'twist' was so obvious that I figured it out in the first five minutes!"" Some of those people may even be telling the truth. There's no way to know. But there's a lot of condescension in such remarks, an implication that anyone who didn't figure it out must be a really dumb sucker. At least in my case I have an excuse. When I first saw this film back in early 2000, I knew nothing about it other than that it was about the relationship between a psychiatrist played by Bruce Willis and a child with some sort of psychic power. I didn't even know what that psychic power was, and an early scene led me to think it was telepathy. In short, I had no idea even what the movie's subject was until about the middle of the film, so I was completely adrift as to solving the movie's mystery.",e
3,11 July 2011,planktonrules,10, Brilliantly crafted and well worth seeing....unless some idiot told you THE secret!,"I am making 100% sure I don't in any way reveal the surprise twist in this film--too many have and I think those people are evil. So, if you know THE twist, you'll probably not enjoy the film nearly as much when you first see it. But, if you haven't, it's a heck of an enjoyable film.",v
4,3 February 2000,Xophianic,9, One of the best films of 1999!,"I am embarrassed to admit that the only reason I saw THE SIXTH SENSE when I did was because THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was sold out. I hadn't seen BLAIR WITCH yet but I heard great reviews, and of course it was sold out when I went to see it. So my friend and I decided to see THE SIXTH SENSE instead. Not only did it turn out to be a better movie than BLAIR WITCH is, but it turned out to be one of my favorites.",i
5,23 March 2000,indianajonze,10, Brilliant,"The Sixth Sense is a brilliant film, plain and simple. It is unique in that it relies on imagination and psychology to scare you and make you think twice about the world around you. The director did a fabulous job constructing the imagery of the film, and I genuinely did not know about the ending until it was revealed. Quite a shock! The Sixth Sense goes in my book as the single greatest psychological horror film I have ever seen. Anyone who bashes it are simply not giving it a chance or don't fully realize the complex dialog and imagery around them. Brilliant",e
6,7 September 2015,SnoopyStyle,10, one of the greatest reveals of all time,"Child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) celebrates an award win with his wife Anna (Olivia Williams). Deranged ex-patient Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) breaks in and shots Malcolm. Vincent then commits suicide. The next fall, Malcolm is treating distressed Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who lives with his single mom Lynn (Toni Collette). His suffering leaves him an outcast at school. After another episode leaves him in the hospital, he tells Malcolm his secret that he ""sees dead people"".",w
7,15 August 2019,NpMoviez,10, The reason why everyone loved Shyamalan back then!!,"Shyamalan at his very best! I said it, I don't care what people think. Many people claim Unbreakable to be his best film till date, but for me, as much as I love Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense will always remain as the best Shyamalan had to offer.",/
8,28 May 2022,Mr-Fusion,8, Unforgettable ghost story,"A horror movie with an inventive premise, a sensitive marital drama, and a psychological puzzler; ""The Sixth Sense"" combines all of these into a deeply affecting movie. Haley Joel Osment (in a justifiably star-making turn) personifies child trauma, and his pain is absolutely heartbreaking. But this is also peak Bruce Willis working with a clockwork script and expert direction. The performances in this film are exceptional.",r
9,27 December 2010,undersky,8, A movie with a gentle but long-lasting impression.,The Sixth Sense enjoys being playful with our imagination. What your eyes see is not exactly what it is. What your mind paints is not exactly what there is. In the world of The Sixth Sense logic is your worst enemy.,w
10,6 August 1999,WCS02,8, Wanna See Dead People?,"""I see Dead People!""  Sixth Sense is well worth the ticket price.  It's a tight story and the acting is outstanding.  There are a couple of good scares, rendered more effective because I dropped my guard.  My sixth sense says such was the Writer/Director's express intention. :-)",0
11,22 March 2006,finding-something,10, A Masterpiece,"A perfect balance. Sad, but not self-pitying. Triumphant, but not cheesy. Frightening, but never grotesque. Shocking, but not gimmicky. Touching without being cheap. Visually it is stunning. There are some truly amazing shots, the attention to color is appreciated. Haley Joel Osment as Cole is extraordinary. What a promising career ahead of him. Bruce Willis, as a workaholic child psychologist, ought to be extremely proud of this, as it may be some of his best work. Tender, brooding, regretful, determined. Perfect. Toni Collette, is really phenomenal. I think she gets overlooked, but with any less talented actress, the film would have certainly suffered.",5
12,2 February 2005,mjw2305,10, It's all in the ending,"Cole (Haley Joel Osment) is a young boy troubled by an affliction, he can see the dead all around him, for much of the time and he is labelled a freak by everyone except his mother. Haley Joel Osment puts in such a fine performance in this role, it is hard to believe he is a child.",8
13,6 January 2012,TheLittleSongbird,10, Shyamalan's best film and the only film of his I consider a masterpiece,"I have to say I am not a fan generally of M Night Shyamalan's films, but I absolutely loved The Sixth Sense. It is a beautifully made film with an afterlife that is anything but angels and harps, and the score has lots of subtlety and atmosphere to it. The script is chilling, intelligent and poignant and the story complete with a knockout twist ending(easily the best and only wholly believable ending of Shyamalan's movies) is simplicity at its finest. Shyamalan's direction is wonderfully controlled, which is exactly what the story needed. Haley Joel Osment gives perhaps his best performance here, though he's superb in AI too, while Toni Collette plays the troubled mum very convincingly and Bruce Willis is suitably quiet and reflective. Overall, a wonderful film and Shyamalan's best by a mile in my opinion. 10/10 Bethany Cox",6
14,10 December 1999,Spirit-2,10, Incredible,"The Sixth Sense is one of those films that rarely happens these days.  In other words, I knew so little about it before sitting in the cinema that it wasn't ruined before it started.",9
15,21 December 2016,Leofwine_draca,9, A thoughtful ghost story that became a Hollywood blockbuster,"My latest outing to the local multiplex was to see this, the second biggest horror film of 1999 after THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. Unfortunately for me, the film had already been ruined partially by trailers, which give away all the key moments of the film. I for one could do without them, as I spent most of the time waiting for the kid to say ""I see dead people"", ""...all the time"" and ""she's standing by my window"". Seeing as these are the best moments of the film, a lot of the impact was softened.",9
16,19 January 2017,ironhorse_iv,9, Have some common sense. Go get the Sixth Sense. It's a horror masterpiece!,"According to director/writer M. Night Shyamalan, the idea of making a horror movie about children seeing ghost; first came to him, while watching an old 1990's Nickelodeon show called 'Are You Afraid of the Dark: titled, 'Tale of the Dream Girl"" (1994), directed by David Winning. Hoping to capitalize on that success, he wrote and pitch a similar idea to studios as a kid movie, until rewrites made the script's subject matter, more mature and harder to sell. That's until, the most unlikeable of sources, came to him, looking to buy it, which was Walt Disney Studios. It seem that then-president of production, David Vogel read Shyamalan's spec script and instantly loved it. Without obtaining corporate approval, Vogel bought the rights, despite the high price tag of $3 million and the stipulation that Shyamalan could direct the film. While, Disney later dismissed Vogel from his position at the studio, and apparently show little confidence in the film value, by selling the production rights to Spyglass Entertainment, while retaining a few distribution rights and 12.5% of the film's box office receipt. They still greenlit the project and gave their share. Lucky for them, the film was the biggest jackpot gamble win of all time, becoming one of biggest box-office hits of the 1990s. The reasons, why everybody loves it, are very clear. The film's chilly astrosphere, acting, and unexpected twist ending are some of the best moments, cinema can give you. It was a very memorable movie from a then-unknown director. The story of redemption was also great, with 'Six Sense' telling the story of a once-prideful disheartened child psychologist, Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), dedicated himself, by trying to cure a 9 year old boy, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) from being traumatic by the spirits of the dead. Without spoiling the movie, too much, after watching this film the first time through without spoilers, it is almost impossible to watch it again without seeing obvious foreshadowing, during the second watch. Still, this movie has a lot of rewatch value. I love how the movie has a Hitchcockism/Kubrickism feel to it, as there was a lot of carefully devised storytelling, going on here with the visuals without using too much dialogue. Some great examples are, how the color red was prominent whenever the worlds of the living and the dead came together, follow by visible cold breathing and shivers. Wonderful use of foreshadowing. Added to the tension that is already brought by the wonderful make up effects, sound mixing and haunting soundtrack by composer, James Newton Howard. Another brilliant example of visuals using as foreshadowing, is how everybody's clothes seem heavy wore, their normal hair seem a bit grey/white, and how they barely interact with their surroundings. I like how the filmmaker were very careful, not to spoil the clues of the true state of any of the characters, too much. They were even worry that Cole's iconic, and highly quoted, revealed at the hospital might have spoil the movie for everybody. Lucky for them, most of the audience still, didn't see the twist coming. Another magnificent thing, Shyamalan does well is using reflecting surfaces such as glasses, mirrors, windows, and other reflecting surfaces for a slew of dramatic and thematic reasons. You really get to see, good examples of that, whenever, Malcolm is looking at his depressed wife, Anna (Olivia Williams). Nevertheless, perhaps the best shot in the film, at least for me, was the extreme close-up of the bright silver door knob in the 3rd act with a distorted image of Cole. It was both scary and clear transparent to a positive change. It's great to see, a horror movie, that doesn't end with a downer. Another great use by the director, was the idea of using long take to establish important character relations. We see this, compositional strategy, during the first official meeting between Cole and Malcolm. Not only, does it build a special bond between the two leads, but it gives the impression that Cole's mother, Lynn (Toni Collette) and Malcolm were perhaps are at the end of a conversation about him. Almost tricking the audience. Nevertheless, if they did talk, the dialogue would had been cheesy. As much, as I love, everybody acting, particular Osment. Some of the lines, they were given to say, were a bit silly. A good example of this, was any of the scenes with Lynn and Cole. Seeing them, argue and later, embrace in the car about a Bumble-bee Pen felt a little odd and humorous. It wasn't as intimacy as it should be for me. Still, Toni Collette has said that she was so moved by the emotional resonance of the story while filming, she did not even realize it was a horror film until after its release. Anyway, I think the scenes with Malcolm and Anna, had a more emotional impact on me, than any of the scenes with the Sears interacting with each other. Overall: While, the dialogue writing isn't the best and can be highly spoof by later films. Not even, the awful director cameo by M. Night can hurt this movie. Regardless of what you know, think of M. Night Shyamalan's work since this film. His first horror movie is often viewed as one of the best, and I have to agree. It's worth checking out.",2
17,26 November 1999,Joanna Kelly,9, You'll be knocked for six,"This is an incredibly powerful film. Awash with emotion but never stooping to sentimentality this is the story of one frightened little boy you will never forget. All your worst childhood nightmares: the noises in the attic, the intruder in your house, that cold breath that makes your hair stand on end are here and then some.",/
18,1 January 2021,auuwws,9, The Sixth Sense,"One of the best psychological horror films that I have seen, the film's story was excellent and interesting, the embarrassment in the film was good, the script and the acting were the best bad in the film, especially the child's acting, which was very impressive, the body of his character with distinction, I could not guess the toast of the end and was dazzled by the great end",?
19,1 September 2008,Sterling52,9, I'm not one to watch a movie twice...,"...but I had to watch this one again, right afterward, because I needed to go back and watch for clues. Honestly, and I won't give away the 'ah ha!' moment, but I knew that he was... well, you know, what he was. What I didn't get was how that was possible, or how the interaction with the others that I saw... so I had to go back and watch the movie AGAIN, just to make sure there were no errors in the filming of it. Sure enough, I found none that I could call an error, and was totally blown away with how this was filmed. I am a writer, and I also adapt novels for scripts, and when something like this comes along, that something that just totally grabs me and says, ""This is something special... this is not the ordinary..."" well, I am impressed. I aspire to write something that can really AH HA! someone in this way. I recommend the movie, highly.",r
20,8 December 1999,Readster,10, One of the films of the Nineties,"This is perhaps my film of the decade so far. The reasons are too numerous to go into in such a short critique. Surely there have not been too many films that can take you through the range of emotions that the Sixth Sense does. The prime emotion; fear, is a difficult emotion to generate in a modern audience that has seen it all before, but this film succeeds where others fail, praying on your imagination and generating suspense from subtle devices rather than blatant horror.",e
21,8 May 2022,lhbaker-28783,10, DO NOT READ ANY MORE REVIEWS,"Because you will regret it and suffer the consequences for reading the reviews on The Sixth Sense. Whether the review shows they have spoilers or not do not read them. Many of the non-spoiler reviews spoil the epic plot-twist of The Sixth Sense, and if you know what the twist is, then your enjoyment watching this amazing thriller and one of the best movies I've ever watched, will be ruined. Do not read The Sixth Sense's reviews or you WILL suffer the consequence.",f
22,7 March 2011,pfgpowell-1,6," Fair enough, but not the work of genius some claim","I hate to be a party pooper, but I really can't see what all the fuss is about. The Sixth Sense is an entertaining film, better than some, not as good as others, but it is most certainly not the masterpiece many seem to make it out to be. (Nor, for that matter, is it as bad as many here suggest.) If anything it is an intriguing story, and not original at that - read The Third Policeman - which is realised in a somewhat perfunctory way by Shaymalan. If anything it could have been done better. When I was considering my view of the film, the word 'ponderous' occurred to me more than once, and I think that is about right. The Sixth Sense needed a more delicate touch and, well, it should have been spookier. Having said all that the young lad who portrays young Cole, the boy who can see the dead, give an outstanding performance, and for once an American director has successfully resisted the temptation to make a child more cloying than a mug of treacle. His mother also does well as a harassed single mother, and Bruce Willis shows that there is more to his ability than shooting guns and posing in sweaty T shirts. But I have to repeat: The Sixth Sense is great for a night in but not the earth-shattering Meisterwerk others claim it to be. If anything, there is any number of plot holes which become rather glaring once the film has finished and overall it doesn't quite stack up as it should. But what the hell: that would be serious is it came anyway close to being a work of genius. As it doesn't, those plot holes don't really matter.",_
23,3 April 2006,Hitchcoc,9, It Really Captured My Attention,"I rented this and watched it around midnight a couple years ago. This film, like ""Poltergeist,"" has contributed a line to the eternal world of cinema: ""I see dead people."" I will not spoil this for someone that has not seen it. My comments are on the craftsmanship that is this film. It starts with Haley Joel Osment, who will go down as one of our great child actors. He has the vulnerability and pain that expresses itself so well. His continual bouts with his ""gift"" bring him more pain. He gets an ally in Bruce Willis's character, and they begin to face things together. Unfortunately, like most movies that present something supernatural, a set of rules apply to the world and it these rules that make it fairly easy to pull this down. However, I would rather have them craft it as best they can than try to keep consistent in every aspect. Like ""Memento"" which I saw pretty close to the same time, I don't want to think too much or the fine fabric of the film starts to unravel. How's that for cowardice?",=
24,25 August 1999,SKG-2,8, Strange but ultimately rewarding,"First of all, I've read a few comments about the pace of this movie being too slow.  I sort of agree with that, but I think it's refreshing to have a movie which takes its time and builds things with subtlety(although here, as I said before, I think it took a little TOO much time).  And I think it was realistic at how long it took for the boy to learn to trust the doctor and for how long it took the doctor to discover what was really going on.",t

27,19 October 2005,lee_eisenberg,10, a thriller in the real sense of the word,"Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a Philadelphia psychiatrist meeting with Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a boy who can - OK, I'll say it this one last time - see dead people. While too many horror flicks have relied on gore, this one relies on the subconscious, and other things that we don't realize. And of course, there's the ending. I literally did not see that coming, although there were a number of clues throughout the movie. All that I can say is, you are going to have your mind blown. M. Night Shyamalan truly created an impressive piece of cinema history here, and of his later movies, only ""Unbreakable"" came close to equalling this one's quality.",u
28,21 June 2007,Panterken,10, I see dead people...walking around like regular people.,The Sixth Sense is M. Night Shyamalan first big budget and best film. It's a film that heavily relies on the creating and maintaining of a certain atmosphere. It has a psychological tension that's only broken in a few scenes( Magic trick scene ao.). A little comical relief( although there are only 2 such scenes) is very welcome to not make the story too heavy (so everyone can enjoy it). Films tend to get boring if the story is too linear.,r

30,3 October 2000,Boyo-2,5," Ending ruined, therefore not much to enjoy","Since I just saw this movie but knew the outcome, it was probably not as much fun as the opening weekend audience experienced.  I am willing to admit that that might have taken away from the whole thing. But I still don't think its a very good movie.  The whole thing with the color red seems very cheap and obvious.",
31,28 April 2008,aimless-46,10, A Classic,"""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) is generally regarded as a ghost story and that is what it seems to be during the first viewing. There is also an obvious subtext about the nature of our fears as well as themes concerning courage and communication; elements often incorporated into the genre. Most viewers will be conscious of this stuff during the first viewing but will mostly be focused on sorting out the story and processing the intriguing conclusion. ",
32,16 December 2006,jamiecostelo58,9," Eerie, creepy and superb","Upon first watch of The Sixth Sense, I was hooked and shocked at the same time. I expected a complete horror story, mixed with the usual gore and stomach-churning scenes we ordinarily witness in other movies with a similar theme. The Sixth Sense is anything but. It details the emotional aspects of love and devotion, as well as having to cope with being an outsider.",
33,11 April 2000,Tito-8,5, Somewhat disappointing,"Even with the huge box office returns and critical acclaim, I still didn't have high expectations for this movie.  Nevertheless, I was still expecting this to be a good movie, but it was merely decent.  I did like the ending quite a bit, and the acting was solid throughout, but in general, the film was uninteresting and rarely entertaining.  That's not to say that I was frequently bored throughout, but I was generally indifferent to the characters and to the on-screen happenings.  It's an adequate time killer, but not much more.",
34,3 March 2021,parthaykulkarni,8, I Remember When Shyamalan Was Like This,"Most people today criticize M. Night Shyamalan movies. That's probably going to happen when you release movies such as Avatar: The Last Airbender or After Earth, but it wasn't like this at the turn of the century. When The Sixth Sense was released, it was kind of a big deal, for good reason. The movie is not only well-directed, well-written, well-acted, well-edited, etc., but it's a classic movie and it will stay in my memory for a long time.",
35,9 December 2022,marveller-66,10, Pinnacle of Supernatural Fiction!,"Yeah, I'm the guy who've heard how great of a movie this is years ago without ever actually being spoiled. I feel awful for not watching this any sooner. This movie is a landmark achievement. There were something wrong in direct interaction with a particular someone's personality which bugged me until the very last 5 minutes of the movie where it sorted itself out masterfully. Don't get me wrong, i knew there was gonna be a twist at the end, since it's Shymalan's, but stg, never thought to piece it together like that. If you think narrow-mindedly, the whole story feels non-sense. The horror elements were straight-forward, none were just basic jump-scares, JNH's soundtracks, and superior acting all around, the pacing. This seems to be Night Shyamalan's all-time classic. Outstanding filmmaker. Been a while since watching a good movie. Gonna re-watch after the realisation to see how it feels. Reminds me of the masterpiece, Fight Club. This is definitely among the best movies I've watched.",
36,18 June 2006,rebeljenn,5, average,"'The Sixth Sense' is a horror film about a young boy who has the power to see the ghosts of people who have passed away. The boy gets help from a psychologist and tries to learn how to fit in and know a normal life. The film succeeds in playing the horror as well as cinematography and a plot that makes the audience think. Most of the horror in the film is portrayed in a way that gets the imagination to work and plays on suspense. The plot is engaging and it also makes the audience think. However, I thought that it was predictable and knew what was happening before the end of the film. The performances are done well, and this film does have several strong points, but as a film overall, I think that it was average.",

It's the kind of horror movie that has the odd jump scare, plenty of suspense, and a plot that is intensely captivating. And then, when you get to the end, it slaps you round the face with the ultimate twist! I literally felt my blood run cold when the twist was revealed. Shyamalan does an incredible job, and none of his films since this one have ever had quite the same awe inspiring twist as this film. I recommend it highly!",

41,17 January 2003,dbdumonteil,8, I see dead people....,"Here comes Bruce Willis again in the skin of a rescuer! But unlike ""the fifth element"" and ""armageddon"", he mustn't save the whole wide world. Neither, must he save a group of persons from a terrorist threat as it was the case with ""die hard. No, he simply must save a little boy called Cole, haunted by morbid visions and Willis, a reputable psychologist tries hard to heal him... With ""fight club"" and ""the blair witch project"", ""the sixth sense"" ranks among the best movies made in 1999. It also ranks among the movies that you must watch several times before really appreciating it. If you're watching this movie for the first time, you might be disappointed because there are numerous details that can escape your attention and however, they are important for the development of the story. The same thing can also be said for a few scenes, especially the one when Willis is in a restaurant with his wife facing him... Because the main strength of the movie is its screenplay. Rarely, a movie has been so well served by a watertight screenplay. It's disconcerting, disturbing and however perfectly coherent. For a long part, the movie is a beautiful ""trompe l'oeil"". On another hand, it's a pleasure to see Bruce Willis get out of his usual roles where he mostly plays the he-man. In ""the sixth sense"", it's obvious that he's between the hands of a conscientious and well-organized director. But he isn't the main center of the movie. This place goes to Haley Joel Osment. His performance in the role of a tormented and neurotic boy is extraordinary. Besides, he can be considered as a faraway cousin of Danny, the little boy in Kubrick's ""shining"" because they've got a common point: an odd power supernatural and all in all, the dead people who haunt Cole aren't so terrible as they look like: they're simply asking him for help... At the end, a fascinating movie held up by two great actors.",
42,22 June 2009,tburke85,8, The Sixth Sense An Effective Thriller With A Good Twist Ending,"The Sixth Sense is an effective thriller with a good twist ending from director M Night Shyamalan whose admirable in making this movie which was his first back in 1999. His other films that followed haven't even been on par with this one but thats okay. The cast are good in their roles including Bruce Willis, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams, and especially Haley Joel Osment as the boy who can see dead people. The rest of the cast are okay in their limited screen time. Its best to see this without knowing too much about the film because that will ruin some of the surprises including a revelation about one of the main characters. This film does have a little suspense and creepy moments but there could have been more of them. This film felt a bit like a drama with thriller and supernatural elements which wasn't a bad thing. The music by James Newton Howard seems to sync very well with the tone of the film and what was happening on the screen. The creepy moments usually involving a dead person being seen are well executed and paced. This is a movie you'll want to see twice so you can pick up on things you didn't notice before the first time around. The pacing was a little slow at times but the rest of the movie made up for its few flaws. Overall The Sixth Sense is a solid thriller with some suspense, creepy moments, drama, a little humor, and exceptional performances by the cast who make this movie worth the time to watch.",
43,26 March 2006,moonspinner55,6," Polished, efficient, derivative, inert...","Bruce Willis looks appropriately grim throughout thriller about a child psychologist who attempts to help a troubled young boy who claims to see ghosts. Surprisingly popular other-worldly yarn (surprising because the film is so old-fashioned), it goes to sometimes hokey means to get a scare out of the audience, but is nevertheless very well-made and engrossing. Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, the picture is low-keyed, somewhat ambitious, but not very delicate, with plot-holes and moments where there seems to be no driving force behind the narrative; for such a deliberately-paced movie, Shyamalan doesn't show much grace, only technical finesse.

Unlike the empty Matrix and the Phantom Menace, the Sixth Sense is a character driven drama. It comes to a conclusion that no other ghost movie (that I've ever seen) has touched on. I think the film has a good chance to snatch up some Oscar noms. I think it deserves nods for script and definitely Best Supporting Actor in Osment (though he really is the main character, he is pushed to second string because of the bigger star).

Instead, the ominous sense of mystery created by the relatively slow and self-assured pacing; the mature and well-crafted scares stemming solely from our connection to the nuanced characters as opposed to obnoxiously loud musical cues; the layered and intelligent screenplay that dares to assume its audience is smart enough to understand what it is presenting; and the phenomenal performances that cement 'The Sixth Sense (1999)' as existing within a grounded reality - including what is arguably the best child performance ever put to film - are what make this emotional, gripping and complex drama stand out as one of the best horror films of the last twenty years. 8/10",

69,6 January 2008,HelloTexas11,8, the ultimate twist ending,"This might be the spoiler to beat all spoilers- Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), one of the two main characters in 'The Sixth Sense,' is actually dead through most of the movie and the audience doesn't know it. Thanks to an extremely clever and manipulative plot and a spectacularly successful twist ending, most people ended up going back to see 'The Sixth Sense' a second time, just to pick up all the 'clues' they missed the first time, and which are indeed there for anyone to see. The thing is, hardly anyone does. The movie was M. Night Shyamalan's breakthrough success, grossing over $600 million worldwide (all those second and third viewings helped big-time) and one wonders if it wasn't at least partially a fluke. With the exception of 'Signs,' none of his other films has been a success, either critically or at the box office. The approach that worked so well in 'Sixth Sense' does not appear to be readily transferable to other material. But 'Sixth Sense' is a certifiable masterpiece of horror and suspense. It benefits greatly from young Haley Joel Osment's totally believable performance as Cole Sear, the nine-year-old boy who ""sees dead people."" The state of anxiety and fear he lives in is transmitted to the audience beyond the point of feeling sympathy for him; we actually come to feel the emotions he feels. No one except Cole can see the dead, but Shyamalan does not resort to trickery or suggestion in this regard: the deceased are right out in the open for the audience to see. One might think this would be the film's fatal flaw. It is certainly audacious. At one point in 'Sixth Sense,' when Dr. Crowe asks Cole if there are any dead persons present, the boy says there are, and sure enough, in the background are three gruesomely made-up figures hanging from the rafters. Similarly, later on, when a cyclist is killed in an accident and Cole and his mother are stuck in traffic as a result, the dead cyclist is shown standing right outside their car, peering in the passenger window. Cole's expression seems to be one of ""here we go again,"" and is almost grimly humorous. But it all works and somehow proves to be very frightening. This straightforward approach to things that are usually only hinted at or seen in fleeting glimpses (one might contrast this with the first 'Alien' film, where the creature is never fully seen till the very end) turns out to be quite refreshing and most effective. Bruce Willis underplays his character, which is essential for the ending to work. Throughout the film, we are led to believe that his marriage is at the end of its rope, and that his wife's refusal to speak to him or even acknowledge him is simply a manifestation of that fact. All of this is masterfully played out and when at the climax, we learn his wife has never answered him because he hasn't been there, it comes as a complete shock. If AFI ever does a list of '100 Greatest Surprise Endings,' 'The Sixth Sense' will surely top the list.",

The tale is of a popular, but egotistic doctor (Bruce Willis) who sincerely believes in his award winning psychotherapeutic abilities and looks forward to a prosperous career with the mentally ill. But failing to secure a proper treatment for a suicidal patient, the doctor finds himself with yet another troubled, but far more mysterious boy (Halley Joel Osment) who possesses the power to communicate with the afterlife. Together they discover their own fears and a need for mutual understanding and trust. The film is a frightful combination of sights, sounds and illusionary symbols which creates terror and suspense with each new scene. The Director, like other famous movie artists, makes a cameo appearance and it up to the viewer to locate him during the unfolding drama.

74,13 February 2005,ryan_kuhn,8," ""Do you know why you're afraid when you're alone?""","We all know the ending by now, so I won't pretend no one knows how it ends. A suspenseful return back into the world of ghost stories carries The Sixth Sense, the first major film success by M. Night Shyamalan. The film revolves around a child, Cole Sear, who is socially awkward mainly because he can see ghosts and struggles with that each day, played by Haley Joel Osment in an Oscar Award nominated role. Bruce Willis plays Malcome Crowe, a child case worker who invests all of his time into Cole. As he investigates what is happening, he finds that he has come across a case similar to Cole's in the past, but is no nearer to figuring out how to help him. The human drama of a case worker trying to figure out what is wrong with his patient keeps the movie going, allowing Shyamalan to drop the clues throughout the movie about the ending. I have to admit I was blown away by the ending, but looking back, I should have known better, and many audiences were able to figure it all out. Some say that if you look at the movie logically, it does not hold water, but that is not the point. The movie is not about logic, but rather the experience as a viewer, watching what the director gives us, as we only see what he wants us to see. The Sixth Sense also boasts a strong soundtrack and looks good, setting a mood that gets the audience in the right frame of mind to be spooked, though it's not a horror movie. Suspenseful, smart, and well directed, The Sixth Sense is an achievement not to be underestimated.",

Reruns of ""Murphy Brown"" on Nick at Night made fun of the line in phony interviews with Candice Bergen, but like many famous lines in movie history, the subtle way the line is said is often dramatically altered.

On its own, The Sixth Sense is a well-made supernatural thriller starring Bruce Willis as a psychologist and child actor Haley Joel Osment (whose breakout role was Forrest Gump Jr) in his care. Their investigation into a series of paranormal incidents leads to a terrific revelation that no one saw coming at the time. While the scary bits may feel mediocre, the twist ending is still fresh for a film that is over two decades old.

107,2 April 2008,dead47548,9, I benefited a lot from revisiting it.,"I saw this film a few years ago and remembered a few scenes, but not the majority of it. The one big problem being that one of the things I did remember was the twist. So going through this re-watch it all seemed very, very obvious but that probably has a lot to do with the fact that I knew what it was. Either way, it's a good story; compelling and incredibly unique that I was able to enjoy a lot. I quite enjoyed Shyamalan's use of the color red (his use of colors in all of his films is quite extraordinary, really). The twist is a good one and adds a lot of depth to the characters, especially Malcolm, obviously. I really like the idea of him being around for the sole purpose of helping Cole learn to live with his sixth sense after being killed a year ago because he failed to help someone with the same gift. That's the twist that really made an impression on me and stunned me for a second; the fact that the man who murdered him was such a nutcase and killed him due to the fact that he had the same gift Cole has and Malcolm couldn't help him with it. I liked that complexity in the character a lot. Some of the scenes are very melodramatic and overdone and I really, really hated the editing (it was just too abrupt and out of place) but overall I thought it was compelling and the ambiance was very well structured. Toni Collette was pretty great also, especially in her final scene where Cole tells her about his gift; she was really heartbreaking there and had my eyes watering up. I think Shyamalan's masterpiece comes in his next feature, Unbreakable, but this is still a solid film that I'm glad I revisited.",

It's all woven around a very interesting and convincing drama, the scariness complimenting the drama and vice versa, just extremely well done. Bruce Willis is one of those guys that you know is a total cheese ball, yet most of his work is pretty damn good. He's great, the kid is great, the two female leads both excellent.

I remember being scared by the ghosts and dead people and that's about it. I even went to see it a couple of times including one night when I went to see it at the Drive-In with a friend and didn't get home until about 1:30 am. As I entered the house that night I couldn't help but hear Cole's voice in my head saying ""I see dead people"" and I ran to my room trying to keep myself from screaming out in terror. I remember that this was the first movie with a major plot twist in it that I remember really striking me as noteworthy. I'm sure I had seen others before but this one was kind of a hype for a little while. ""Did you see 6th Sense? How about that twist? Wasn't that crazy!"" Despite that, I remember that I didn't really understand it completely. I guess you could say that I was kind of immature both in life experience to be able to draw the conclusions I was supposed to about the characters and I was also inexperienced in the art of following a movie plot beyond the complexity of good guy has conflict, adventure, solve conflict, the end.

The plot of this slow-building horror-noir, heavily drawing on cult classics like the certain 1980 movie directed by the late, great Stanley Kubrick, is not without merits, courtesy of a poignant treatment of a disturbed, misunderstood child prodigy. The supernatural elements of the film, on the other hand are contrived to such extremes that they are not believable at all and lack the power to truly frighten. Bruce Willis, as the child psychologist with a tough case and an unhappy marriage, should be given proper credit for restrained, realistic acting. But neither he, nor his gifted young patient can fix the holes in the scenery, which, if properly scrutinized, will reveal inexcusable and ludicrous inconsistencies. The consistently solemn, dour tone set to painfully conventional ""gloomy suspense"" music, does not improve the picture either; and the so-called ""surprise ending"" which everyone seems to be so fascinated with, makes VERY LITTLE SENSE if given sufficient thought.",

His cheesy, weak line delivery was unbearable, as the directors felt that through a quite kid in the mix, and everyone will overlook everything else. Where Stir of Echos gave your characters to root for, against, and others who you actually got concerned about, the Sixth sense gave us empty throw away people whom we really could care less if they died, lived, or anything else. Bruce Willis, who has smartly rebounded since with Sin City and Hostage, seemed that he was hell bent on making a movie bad enough to make everyone forget about the Ishtar of the 90's Armageddon. The film was badly done, from storyline (a mention of the plot holes would generally take up an entire page on the IMDb site), to a false twist ending. You want to know how the story ends.

There's a certain desire in creatives to surprise their audiences, to give them the unexpected, and the plot twist is an easy tool to use in such circumstances. The key to a good twist is that it needs to not only recast the movie that came before it so that the audience has to re-evaluate what they've just seen, but it also needs to be naturally built into the story itself. That leads to a compulsion to hide clues that otherwise shouldn't be hidden, or to even outright lie (like in High Tension). The Sixth Sense is a film with a twist that very easily meets the parameters of a good twist because of a couple of major reasons.",
130,30 August 2008,Rockford_6,8, Shyamalan,"I don't really want to talk a lot about this movie because I could spoil the effect. Instead, I'll talk about this filmmaker's first movie. THE SIXTH SENSE, also by M. Night Shyamalan. I first saw it in December 1999, on a 20-hour flight from Chicago to Hong Kong. My only flight out of the USA. The film really pulled me in, which I suspect is particularly difficult on an airplane. Then, the ending. Based on the article you just read, we can say that some viewers weren't surprised. Me, I was blown the heck away and wanted to see it again. Years later I finally did. I taught movie classes, this is a film I chose, and I saw it about a dozen times, fully aware of the ending. It had a bit more going for it than that. My only complaint is with people who think Bruce Willis was the star. The star is Haley Joel Osment! I may have missed out on ""the surprise ending"" because I was watching the kid instead of the shrink. Bruce Willis could probably star in a few more movies after he died and we'd never notice. But I digress. THE VILLAGE is about a pilgrim-style village. Some place quaint, rural, close knit and low tech. Nobody from the village goes into the surrounding woods lest they encounter Those We Do Not Speak Of. The acting was flawless and the scenery most certainly created a mood. Shyamalan is a masterful writer, director and producer. But I had trouble caring about what happened to his characters. That could've been my fault. Saturday morning at 8, Jan was working, and my goal for the day was to pack for our impending move but I was too drained to begin. The neighbor had loaned us this DVD back in February, so I figured watching it and returning it to him was a good start. (The same bad attitude that I brought to THE SIXTH SENSE, right? One of these days I'm going to watch a Shyamalan movie in the right frame of mind.) ""The ending."" How would you like to be a filmmaker judged solely on ""the ending?"" In the case of THE VILLAGE, it worked for me. I thought about this film for days after seeing it. Actually, I was trying to decide what to write in this review. How about this? ""Shyamalan is a filmmaker of bold originality surviving in a commercialized medium."" That's a good thing, no matter what your opinion of each individual film is. I believe some critics are panning him, but I'm not panning this one. I'm glad I saw it. I've missed a few films between THE SIXTH SENSE and THE VILLAGE, and there will be more after THE VILLAGE. I'll watch them all.",

Haley Joel Osmont was simply excellent in this movie. It is a shame that puberty really was not good on him but his performance was impressive and convincing as the boy with 'the sixth sense.' For those wondering what the sixth sense is, well it is the ability to see dead people! Toni Collette was also very convincing as the mother who is left confused and suspicious of her son and his secret. All the other support cast are very good as well.

It only generates interest from the 2nd half. It also sends us a secret message on child abuse, which was ignored by most of us.

147,21 April 2020,ivanmessimilos,10, Perfect movie,"Bruce Willis interprets the lead, uncharacteristic of him as playing a child psychiatrist and I think he did a great job, ie I believed he was a psychiatrist, not a sweaty bloody character who would just break the drug chain after numerous explosions and loud shootings, hence the role he specializes. He wants to help the boy Cole, who has his secrets and inner demons, as he reminds him of one past patient he failed to help.
If Willis did a great job, what about young Haley Joel Osment? Little was devastated in his role, which even earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. To this day, this role remains one of the best, if not the best, children's role on the big screen. Osment already auditioned for the role because he was wearing a tie and when the director asked him if he had read his role, he said that he had read it three times and that was the whole scenario. He was so ready. We can clearly see the seriousness of his character through dialogues with Willis, but also with his mother, played (supremely) by Tony Collette.

154,9 August 2000,slothfratelli,5, That ending was unbelievable!!! Meaning i didnt buy it.,"The Sixth Sense is the most overrated film is years - it is a rehash of every horror movie prior. Opened drawers all of a sudden (= poltergeist switching chairs with drawers), dead people walking around (=zombie movies - anything!). The kid is good but Bruce Willis doesnt show any emotions at all. A good performance they all say - what did he do but walk around solemnly. What is so good about this movie? The ending they all say. SPOILERS: So Bruce Willis never once had a shower in sixth months and noticed the bloody-big bullet hole in his chest rubbing that stinging soap into his gaping wound? He never once went to buy some groceries and wondered why the shop assistant didnt demand or take his money - just ignored him? He never talked to his wife once? He didnt think how rude Toni Collette was for not talking to him? She let him into her apartment and sat opposite him not doing anything at all. Either Willis is retarded or this movie blows. I think the latter. Ive given a low rating to bring this average down. Its not that i rank this movie alongside Streetfighter, Mac and Me, and The Secret Agent club, its not that bad. Its just that its not that good either and im annoyed about everyone going on and on and on about it all the time. Ciao.",
155,21 May 2013,tay-sedai,10," Amazing, even when you re-watch","The Sixth Sense is one of those movies that once you've seen it the first time, you're never going to be able to watch it the same way again, due to the gasp-worthy twist near the end. So, in that sense, it's sort of a one-time deal. I still remember how I actually did gasp, and feel this jolt of shock go through me, when watching it at the cinema and realising the truth of the situation. And while I can never recapture that feeling when watching this film again, I do still get a lot out of it while re-watching.",

157,29 June 2004,pgear83,7," Good, but too much promotion","M. Night Shyamalan's first film was impressive. Like his later movies its strengths were in it's dark mood and atmosphere and in its modern take on a classic story premise (ghosts). Also notable were the use of color and temperature for thematic purposes.  Haley Joel Osment delivered an excellent breakthrough performance and was nominated for an Oscar.  However, the surprise ending was actually rather predictable, mainly because of the hype surrounding the twist which gave people almost a year to think about it if they didn't see it in theatres. Unbreakable and Signs were both significant improvements over The Sixth Sense.  It was good film overall.      7/10",
158,7 July 1999,JimB-4,10," Excellent thriller -- intelligent, touching, rewarding","I saw this at a preview screening, but in June, when the effects and music were in place and the final cut was available. This is the best ghost story I've seen since Robert Wise's classic THE HAUNTING. It's smart and very moving, while still having the requisite thrills. It doesn't cater to the ""jump out and yell Boo! every six minutes"" theory of thriller, but it has a number of genuine shocks (and a fabulous twist toward the end). Bruce Willis is wonderful - subdued and intelligent in his best dramatic performance since IN COUNTRY. And Haley Joel Osment is simply superb as the haunted Cole. He never overreaches or overacts. He simply experiences and reveals. It's one of the best dramatic child performances I've seen in years. If you liked THE INNOCENTS or THE HAUNTING or even GHOST, I highly recommend this film to you.",

160,3 July 2015,DrewAlexanderR1,8, M. Night Shyamalan on the Map,"The Sixth Sense did an excellent job of combining drama with suspense. The cinematography has slow pans and long shots which allow you to sit with each scene and take it all in. From the beginning M. Night Shymalan draws the viewer in with the stillness of the scenes, and immediately you are sucked into the world of Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis).",
161,2 June 2010,martijn-56,10, The standard for the twist story genre,"I consider this the very best twist-story I have ever seen, followed at great distance by The Others. That I am not the only one, of course, is best shown by the great spin-off, included those by the same director. And even more the fact, that none succeeded to equal, let alone surpass this movie. The movie is compelling and keeps you intrigued to the end, and the end, well, it is legendary. To me it is so brilliant, like you have seen two good movies in one. Many movies of the twist-genre, if I may call it that, do not respect the checklist for endings. And ending should wrap things up, tie up loose ends, without tearing the story we have seen so far apart (in the worst case telling the reader it was all a dream). The sixth sense does this better than any movie before or since. But before I get to that, let's start at the beginning. It started with Bruce Willis getting shot by his former patient, now a grown man still troubled by apparently non-existing phenomena. It gives the right background, since we are introduced to the main character, Bruce Willis, being a child psychologist, who has dropped the ball somewhere along the line. Or not? Was that patient mad? The rest of the story is about Bruce Willis' character seeking redemption for his failure, as he feels it, by trying to do it right next time. That chance comes with the gifted child that is showing the same problems. But before that, remember the cut? After Bruce was gunned down you see him suddenly sitting, the next fall, on a couch outside, waiting for the young boy. It struck me as lonely, and strange. Of course, in hindsight, it was all deliberately put there including the clever camera work and fall setting, as any good story should only contain things that belong there for a reason. I thought: where is the hospital, where is the wife? Why is the atmosphere so lonely, and deserted? Well we know now why, but I did not then, so this was one question, one unsolved delayed bit of information – always a good thing to keep the reader, or watcher, hooked. Also his contact with his wife: distant, short visits, monologues rather than discussions. I thought they are in a fight, but about what? The end provided the explanation: they were not in a fight, but she could not see him, and she looked sad since she was mourning about her dead husband. A very smart way of twisting a story. It is very hard to do, especially since the whole movie you have seen stays intact, even after the surprise. All you saw happened, only from a different perspective. Just when I started to think the start was too weird, I was intrigued just in time by the ghosts that came along with the little boy Bruce had as a patient. I thought it would end up like Poltergeist, the spirits entering the real world, Bruce having to sacrifice himself, redemption, end. But the real horror came from the people themselves, with of course the climax the video of the dead girl, showing she was poisoned by her stepmother. A very different approach and hard to do, but this movie succeeded in being scary without showing the obvious spooks alone, but with staying in the real world. Take 'The Others', for instance, that movie had the advantage of the claustrophobic effect you automatically get when you choose an isolated place, like the estate they were on. The Sixth Sense only had the open world, a city, as we know it, and the heroes could walk anywhere. Not easy to create a scary atmosphere, there, since the characters could just go away when things got scared, right? But they couldn't , since the ghost where all over the place, too. All the questions I had during the movie were all perfectly wrapped up in the end. I thought: why would Bruce find out now, not earlier or later, he was dead? Well, he had come full circle, he helped the boy where he could not help a boy in the past. If he would let go now, his wife could move on and she was ready, having a new boyfriend. The time was right. The boy, he came full circle too: by listening to the ghosts, he would find out he was no freak since they did exist. They were there and by listening to them he could be of use to the people that they left behind. Also his mother understood her son was just gifted and not a freak, by the somewhat over emotional scene with him telling about her dead mother showing up at some high school event, something he could obviously not have known. It is extremely hard to wrap all things up this perfect, and the reason this movie does it nevertheless, is because it showed a carefully constructed story which was possible to interpret in two ways all the time. By diverting me to the ghosts themselves, I totally forgot to bother about what was going on with Bruce Willis' character himself and his wife, and why it did not fit. It stayed in the back of my head, but the ghosts were even more dominant. Brilliant, you can only do this once. Furthermore I can add the acting is very good, and the camera-work also, especially the scene with the stepmother. So all the way to the end, the movie is surprising, intriguing and scary. It left the Poltergeist or Exorcist approach and by staying in the real world it made the ghosts even more scary, or exciting if that is the word. The end itself is the biggest surprise any movie has shown, and manages yet to leave all you saw intact, even adding a depth to the story. Perfect. A perfect story, made into a perfect movie. Ten stars.",
162,6 September 1999,thefan-2,1, Pretty lame,"It's one of those movies in which several key characters would have to be stupid, or laughably inattentive, to behave the way they do, and in which the director repeatedly has to cut away from certain scenes and move hastily on, in the hope that we won't notice.  Cheap trick.  There were a couple of well-executed startles, which are always fun, and the drizzly autumnal atmosphere was just right.  Bruce Willis is his usual smirky self.  The little boy is very good.  The ""surprise"" was figured out in the following order, according to the people involved: my 15-year-old-son (the movie maven in the family), right after the opening sequence; myself, about 15 minutes in; my wife, a couple of scenes before the truth comes out at the end; my 13-year-old daughter, when we explained it to her on the way out to the car.",

165,13 August 2010,abrown975,9, An absolutely brilliant masterpiece in every aspect it utilizes,"There are only a handful of movies out there that have everything in it. Thankfully, this movie is one of them. What I mean by that is it has the horror (the absolutely creepy/terrifying type, not the crappy something-pops-out-and-startles-you junk), the sadness (Jesus, I pretty much just end up feeling sorry for every character), the happiness (and when the happiness comes, you feel so genuinely happy and warm that you could cry), and the best part- the twists (the kind that hits you like a ton of bricks, not some stupid, run-o-the-mill misleads and whatnot). But that's not all. The acting was beyond superb. Bruce Willis was spectacular as the main character, Dr. Malcolm Crowe. I honestly think an Academy Award nomination should have been given for him. But the Academy made up for that in giving, first off, Toni Collette a nomination. She had such a great performance as the distraught mother who only wanted a normal life for her son. But the real praise should go to young Haley Joel Osment, who also had an A.A. nomination, but should have won in my opinion. I will not go into depth because there is just not enough good things to say about his absolutely brilliant performance. The only thing I will say is that he had one of the most convincing and emotional performances of anyone I have ever seen, and he was only 11 at the time! However, a lot of the applause should go to M. Night. Shyamalan, whose writing and directing just goes to show that when he has the right material, he can REALLY make it work! I really hope he gets more opportunities to show off his talent, let's just hope he doesn't do anymore TV show remakes (The Last Airbender was just plain awful).

Bruce dies, in the beginning, but we are not 'officially' told this until the supposedly twist ending, and then becomes a friend of a kid who sees dead people. but the red hearings we keep seeing to keep us from this twisted are misleading and in the end, i felt betrayed. the kids sees dead people, Bruce is dead. all the other dead people's wounds can be seen, not Bruce's. not until the end. misleading. all the scenes where the kid starts talking to Bruce, he is supposed to be interacting with the kid's mom or others and such. its supposed to be cool that he isn't really and we are not supposed to notice that. so in the end, we are only tricked into thinking this. but as the rest of the dead people are replaying out what was their life before they died or how they died. Bruce is on an unknown to him mission. very good idea if properly written into the movie. but what ruins it is the kid must know Bruce is dead and says nothing about it. all the rest of the dead people scare the crap out of this kid, but not dead Bruce. and then why does Bruce not realize no one else but the kid is answering him? the unknown mission is to save the second daughter from being poisoned to death by her mom. again, the kid is scared of the ghost girl first daughter while she leads him to the video she made of mom poisoning her. OK, cool, but why didn't she run away instead? but that whole bit seemed so out of place with the rest of the movie even if you did know the twist. why not have the twist realized before this part and then realize that's why Bruce is stuck haunting this kid to finish this mission. otherwise, how did Bruce and the kid really find out about Munchhausen mom? how is it not better to have a tighter better written script with the same twists?",

I've probably seen over 200 films better than this one and the awful unbreakable. I can only assume either (I'm not a horror movie fan), that the supposebly overwhelming atmosphere of Bruce Willis talking to some messed up little boy entertained people, much like horror films or either the modern cliche of adding a big twist on to the end of film to try to make sense of the piffle before it. The latter seems particularly lame, as there is some credit due in the former. I don't see why this makes a film a good film because your bored to death with a nothing storyline for however long, just to be told something to make you feel good when you finish the film. Most of all considering the director did EXACTLY the same thing the doubly pathetic Unbreakable to churn in some money for piffle - pathethic flawed storyling, big twist at end - really shows the lack of imagination and credibility of this film.",

I'm not usually surprised at the bad taste of filmgoers, making such colossal hits out of Home Alone and The Lost World, however this film takes the cake.  I enjoyed the performances, particularly Toni Colette, Haley Joel Osment, and the vastly under-appreciated Bruce Willis.  However, as much as I admire some aspects of the film, the denouement is so predictable and frankly, insulting to any thinking adult, that the success of this film astounds me.  If the film had been like ""The Crying Game"" where the ""surprise"" twist is interesting, but more importantly,  a mere plot device to further the film in it's storyline, I might have had less problems with this movie.  I was shocked that anybody would have been fooled for a moment about the health of Bruce Willis' character.  If American audiences are dimwitted and unobservant not to notice the THOUSANDS of obvious hints that preceed the unveiling of the truth, then this is the film for them.  It was insulting to have to sit through the final minutes of the film, being forced to relive earlier scenes that any intelligent moviegoer should already have noticed.  The mere fact that Willis doesn't change his clothes ONCE should have tipped off everybody!",

Bruce Willis was badly miscast. With so many close-ups the part needed an actor with a greater range who can convey tension subtly and convincingly and not the one dimensional comic book action hero looks with the acting ability of a turnip. Bruce Willis trying ever so hard to be restrained is like torture to watch. Even the much-hyped ending is not so difficult to predict. Too many sub-plots with the dead people cropping up here and there with little point except to try and scare the audience - a hand shooting out from under a table - is all old hat. Stephen King fans will be underwhelmed, and as Hitchcock might have said, it is too slow and lacks humour. Seriously Dull!",

It is well-done and quite intriguing.  I recently bought the DVD, since it was used and I purchased it for a cheap price.  Plus, I was curious about how it would feel watching it for a second time.  I watched it in theaters and thought it was pretty good, but like many others I wanted to see it again to try to uncover clues I didn't perceive the first time around and discover certain elements that I may have overlooked.  I still don't think it's a great movie, but it was interesting watching it and keeping in mind the big plot twist at the end.  As I watched it, the twist made a lot of sense and M. Night Shamalyan didn't just sneak it in for shock value.  He obviously put a lot of thought into both creating this big surprise and making it credible.

Nice pull-backs on the camera during the ""One Step Questions"" scene between Willis and Osment. It takes place in 1999, but has a cool gothic late 70s/early 80s feel to it.

Most people favour the twist ending (which is amazing), but I always loved the scene when Cole tells his mother that he's been visited by his dead Grandma. It's a potent, poignant scene that's brilliantly acted. And the revelation that Willis' character was dead all along cement this 90's thriller as a classic.",

223,14 August 1999,Mr.Berry,3," Boring with a predictable ending. That's right, predictable!","Before seeing this movie, I had heard there was a surprise ending.  I knew no more than that and was able to come up with a nice twist ending before seeing the movie.  True to my instincts, this movie ended exactly as I predicted.  Because I had already figured out the ending, the clues in the movie seemed so obvious to me, I wondered why people were not figuring it all out.  But people are surprised are by the ending, and I can't understand why.  This movie might be worthwhile if you can't pick up on clues.  But I could not enjoy it.  Some reviewers say once you see it once, you have to review the movie to understand everything.  Well because I had already guessed the ending, I felt like I had already seen this movie and every scene just led up to an already known end.  I don't know whether to be proud or disappointed.  Proud as in I guessed the ending before seeing the movie or disappointed as in the writers couldn't come up with anything better. I was left with a ""that's it?"" feeling.  So if you already have an idea as to what the ""surprise"" ending is, then do not go see this movie, you're probably right.  But if you can't even fathom a guess or don't like to think during a movie, then by all means go see it.",

M.Night is sensational directing this onion-skin of a thriller story, but who doesn't realize that? The bedroom scene with the doctor and his wife was what a shocking good thriller is made of. Donny Wahlberg is a terrifying short detour in this right-made enthraller that packs a whopping cast that has authentic developed personalities with an eerie undertone. Bruce again shows that he is the right choice for a major story that captivates from the start to the end. You feel for Malcom Crow, as he seems to be searching for truth and help for this young boy. The mother has a real appeal in that (Toni Colette is superb)the actress is a well crossed role player that seems like there is just no-acting there. She is on it. All the while, there are scenes that are not 'shot' impatiently. I think that so much of Hollywood is cutting, cutting, cutting to make the scheduled time box that the formula fits into. The visual chemistry woven is done almost with a cinematic respect for the classic film noir, they are held in the length that makes them perfect grippers, you see what's happening and it gives enough 'pause' then makes you feel the chill across the back of your neck. When the story captives and the performances are cut to fit as right as this is, you know that not all movies are even. Not by a long shot. Bruce Willis has a definite old world quality of acting, in a new world format. This movie unfolds with precision in story telling and character development with the good Doctor and the boy and then when it goes to the end, it twists and you are left feeling that cold chill once again.

Cinematography isn't always straightforward and there are some creative approaches to certain scenes that I can really appreciate.

You start sweating and and heart races kind of fast, and your head goes crazy and you don't know what to think. That's what I was going through when I first watched this. Well you might think my actions are a bit over dramatic, but I was only eight. The Sixth Sense is not a stupid horror film. It's smart, moves along well, and it's not going to disappoint. The acting is acceptable and the directing and the feel of the film just makes you feel like you're there with the boy, facing his fears, and feeling what's going through his innocent and limited mind. Bruce Willis is very good in it, and he's a great character, being a psychiatrist for kids. You'd never guess he was John McClane. This film is a revolution to horror scenarios. This horror film doesn't depend on images to scare you, like The Exorcist, and it doesn't fully work with you mentally like The Silence of the Lambs to scare you out, but rather it uses something different. It attracts your Sixth Sense, and gives you another kind of scared feeling.

It was obviously scenes were missing from a more detail, R-rated cut. THIS IS THE DIRECTION HORROR MOVIES ARE HEADED IN??? Oh man, first Scream, the I Know What You Did Last Summer, now this???

Alright, not a bad movie like Armageddon (which was 'bad' in the worst meaning of the word). This film is just out of place. Nice but cliche idea, that would make a perfect 30 min. episode in the Twilight Zone. But pulling this pale story out to a full length movie? Please! The most annoying thing about this is the 8+ rating of the movie and all that hype! Best movie ever? Best plot twist ever? Oh, no! This movie was so boooring! So, Bruce Willis gets killed in the first five minutes... Why is everyone behaving so silly? Don't they know that he is dead? And that's when (about 30 minutes into the movie) you realize that you've just spoiled the movie. That should have been that awesome plot twist at the end! You silly! Since it is evident that Bruce is dead, it is rather frustrating to watch the scenes in which the director is trying to foreshadow the dark twist at the end. Banal, cliche and childish. Yawn! At least Bruce Willis is not wearing a bloody shirt this time, nice try though... I wouldn't say that this movie is bad, if only I hadn't seen some other good movies with really good and unpredictable thrilling plot twists. Yep, it can be done, if you just put a little more work in the movie instead of the commercials and adverts. If you want a good plot twist, go and watch Jacob's Ladder or Brazil or L.A. confidential!

Although I do believe The Sixth Sense is the most frightening horror film I have ever seen, making me jump even after seeing it a handful of times. The movie isn't exactly a jumpscare kind of movie, but I think it has some of the most brilliant jumpscares I have ever seen. My favorite being while Cole stands in the bathroom in the middle of the night, and we see the lower body of a woman abruptly walk past the doorway when we were under the impression he was alone. Also, the scene where he hides from the young girl is terrifying, actually making me think of the young girls from The Shining.",

274,3 March 2000,coop-16,10, Far more than a horror film,"There are two kinds of great genre film. The first is the sort that exemplifies the conventions of the genre, while respecting the genre's limits. The second kind of genre film uses the rhetoric and archetypes of the genre to film to point beyond the limits of genre, to attain the level of the symbolic, the ethical and the spiritual.Thus , in the film Noir genre,Kiss Me Deadly is a brilliant example of the first kind of good genre film, while Touch of Evil is a brilliant example of the second. The greatness of The Sixth Sense-and I firmly believe that it is one of the handful of films from last year that can be classified as truly great-lies precisely in how it transcends its genre.The Sixth Sense resonates with Hawthornesque tonalities. It echoes Melville, Poe and Henry James ( I refer to James' great ghost stories, not his often tedious ""novels of manners"").The critics who saw only only a creepy, dull story with a twist at the end missed entirely the films extraordinary religious symbolism. The Bruce Willis Character is a soul in limbo, waiting to be saved. The instrument of salvation? A frightened, yet preternaturally gifted, child.Not a single performance in the film hit a false note..this is an extraordinary film about parents and children, about husbands and wives, and about life and death. The score, the cinematography, and the script were uniformly excellent. I i especially liked the filmmakers' brilliant use of the Philadelphia locale, and the way in which the cities dark history was alluded to. In short, a wonderful film and an exhilarating religious experience-SUPERB",

It's not that I don't appreciate a good suspenseful movie, but current movie tend to be more than I can handle. But The Sixth Sense is a movie that kept the suspense and didn't have the gore. I was riveted from the moment it started. Bruce Willis was great as the doctor and the rest of the cast was outstanding as well. However, what makes the movie great were the writing and the direction. The story keeps you interested and on the edge of your seat. I don't believe in esp or ghosts, but the writing made the concepts seem realistic and believable. There are few red herrings and the surprise at the end of the movie really was a surprise. The direction of the movie probably was the strongest point. The movie is quiet with few loud, screeching moments  like many horror movies, such as Halloween or any of the many Friday the 13th flicks  which makes it even more suspenseful. This is a must see for any suspense fan.",

After being shot we are re-introduced to Bruce Willis's character ""in the fall""..right. And it's not until the end of the film - after all the discussions with the boy - that he realises his wife isn't speaking to him. Mmm. Bit like the 'here it comes' ending to the Village. There's no major benefit building a whole film round the last five minutes and when the audience is lied to then it's even more unforgivable. Very few films build a case for spending 2 hours setting up the punchline - Usual Suspects springs to mind - but Sixth Sense isn't one of them. A cheap trick in a pretty dress.",

Its a cold scene that shatters the warm atmosphere they are in before he appears. Our child Psychologist becomes obsessed with helping one of his patients, a terrified young boy who sees dead people, the two leads are magnificent, a good script even if you guess the downbeat ending, at the time I did not because these kind of twists were still just about becoming in vogue. Actually when I saw this film I loved it because it had a new recipe to horror movies, it struck new chords inside which is not always easy. The parts I found very creepy is that our camera inside the house plays the eyes of the dead, which I found very threatening.",
280,20 September 2005,jboothmillard,8, The Sixth Sense,"You probably know the five human senses: Touch, Scent, Sight, Sound and Taste, and this is a terrifying idea for a sixth, from director M. Night Shyamalan (also starring as Dr. Hill). Basically Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a child psychologist recently awarded, and on the same night visited by a mad ex-patient who wounds him by gunshot. A few months later Malcolm is visited by the troubled 9-year-old Cole Sear (Forrest Gump's Haley Joel Osment). He does not tell his secret for a while, but when he does, it is one of the iconic moments of the film, it was number 44 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, ""I see dead people"". It is because of this he is a freak in school, and his mother Lynn (Toni Collette) is very concerned about his increasing problems. Malcolm is now trying to find out whether he is seeing things or not, and trying to rekindle his relationship with wife Anna Crowe (Olivia Williams). Also starring Saw II's Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent Gray, Glenn Fitzgerald as Sean, young Mischa Barton as Kyra Collins and Jurassic Park III's Trevor Morgan as Tommy Tammisimo. The film has a great conclusion as well with Cole's mother weeping at the idea of Cole seeing his Grandma, and Malcolm finding out why his wife has been ignoring him for so long, he wasn't wounded in that gunshot, he died. It was number 60 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 33 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!",

At least the kid got nominated even though he didn't win. Willis is Malcolm Crowe, a gifted child psychologist who is shot in his bedroom by a deranged former patient. A few years later he encounters a young kid named Cole, who is experiencing similar symptoms and appears to be harboring a well kept secret that he doesn't wish to share with anyone. But Crowe keeps pushing to discover what is troubling the boy as his marriage gets worse and worse. What could it be? The answer is as frightening as it is uncontrollable.

The plot twist is one of the biggest USP of this movie and if you are watching this movie in 2020 and didn't get the plot twist till end then it will definitely blow your mind however if you anticipate it already during the movie then you should praise that how well it is crafted and how it would've blow'ed the audience mind in 1999.",

The skill by which the development and resolution of this bizarre and chilling classic make it a modern landmark. Just by this movie alone, Night established himself as Hitchcock's successor. To describe anything more than a bare-bones rendering of the plot would be irresponsible, but here it goes... Malcolm Crow (Bruce Willis) celebrates with his wife a recent award achieved helping counsel disturbed children. Soon he meets up with the weaknesses of his past and must suffer the consequences. For the rest of the movie he has to make it all up with a new client, Cole (Haley Joel Osment) and balance his desire to make his wife his main priority. The juggle isn't easy, and he falters, but is honest, in both attempts to make up mistakes for his past. The causality of another dimension presented is disturbing, yet fascinating. The tension of the story is counterbalanced with a heart that makes more than one plot accessible and enthralling. The performances are superb with arguably Willis' best ever. Osment, for his part, plays a prodigy as a prodigy in what has to be one of the best (if not ""the"" best) childhood performances on film. The supporting cast is remarkable as well. Perhaps critics have given 'The Sixth Sense' grudging praise, for it means to unveil the supernatural in a way that is meant to mirror the real world in an unflattering way. (Psychology is rendered at least overrated.) Shymalan is effective like few directors are with a film that is edited for every second to wrap around the other expertly. I see talented people...",

If there's going to be a twist, or lots of twists, fine. But make sure that they make sense.

It runs for slightly over 100 minutes. The director also appears himself in the film again just like he usually does. I personally believe, however, that ""Signs"" is still his best work to this day. I have to say I enjoyed the first half of ""The Sixth Sense"" more than the second. It feels more intimate with basically the whole first half (after the shooting) being communications between Willis' and Osment's characters. If you know the final twist, it does not hurt the film at all. It even makes the interaction between Willis' character and his ex-wife more interesting: the Zoloft, her not speaking except ""Happy anniversary!""...

It definitely started a new & exciting trend in movies but it also made it more difficult for future movies to surprise(?) us as successfully.
However I really didn't enjoy this movie the first time I watched it and even watched it again to look for certain things that I may have missed. This is something I rarely do (re-watch).
It was a very good classic horror story that kept me entertained and I enjoyed watching till the end.

So what, they figured out the ending ahead of time. I saw the ending and watched it again. I think I feel sorry for those reviewers, I somehow wonder if they are tuned into the complexities and emotions of life. Don't get me wrong, I don't believe in the afterlife, spirits, god or almost anything but love. Despite that, this movie held my eyes glued.

Now I finally seen it and I must say that with the benefit of hindsight, the only startling thing about the film is the introduction of the sensational Haley Joel Osment. Plus, a terrific performance by Toni Collette. Other than that, the film is a mess. Am I wrong? A clever designed twist at the end seems to justify, clumsiness of major proportions. Just look at that wake where Haley reveals the message from the dead girl. Unforgivably lame. All the jolts are underline by a vulgar strike in the music score department. Really bad. Mr Night Shaymalan got very luck in 1999 and has not been able to repeat its fortune since, no matter the obvious, desperate attempts to grab another jackpot. ""The Happening"" was unwatchable, ""Lady In The Water"" the work of someone with a an alarming mounting ego. ""Signs"" another clumsy, half cooked semi idea. Strange, how time puts things in perspective. I was recently reminded that ""The Towering Inferno"" was also, in its day, nominated for an Oscar as the best film of its day.",

Perfectly benign fare to pass a dull afternoon, and I think devotees of Willis will get their fill. There's less plausibility in the other characters and the screenplay seems to reflect this in the way the pair seem estranged from the rest of the world somehow.

The Sixth Sense was Shyamalan's one hit wonder (although I actually like Devil). It's enormous success made him do a handfull of twisty movies which were, IMO, extremely mediocre and boring. But with this, he hit gold. It's one of those movies that changes everything on repetitive viewings. And it finally established that Bruce Willis CAN act. If I remember correct, young Haley Joel Osmont made history, being the youngest nominee for an Oscar. It's NOT a horror or a thriller, it's a mystery, much like another great movie, The Others, which shares some DNA. It's a threesome masterpiece, with troubled Crowe (Willis), in a piss poor marriage (we think... ), young Cole (Osmont), seeing dead people and traumathised, and his mom, wonderfully played by then pretty unknown Toni Collette. The way Shyamalan slowly wrapes open the story is pure, Hitchcockian mastery. We actually SEE everything, but Mr. M. Night knows he holds the cards. I actually remember at the cinema, you could almost feel your hair raising when we see Cole all alone having an encounter with a ghost. I would have given it 10/10 some years ago. But unfortunately, social media again has destroyed some of it's stature with memes, gifs and parodies. I guess it comes with the turf, being a modern classic, highly influental.",

A scene that featured a young teen with the back of his head blown off as he turns away from the camera seemed to suggest this was a horror/ghost story type of film, but the script verged on more thoughtfullness than that. Pensive performances punctuated this schizo feeling.  The film had dangling story lines throughout - but we all admitted, the twist at the end of the movie salvaged it.  We saw a sneak preview, and the audience, too, seemed to agree with us.  Some fool brought their 7 year old child to the screening, and the kid, seemingly bored out of his mind, started tossing his hat up into the air.

The strange thing is I experienced more anticipation in this movie than any ever. As far as horror goes anyway. It really had me on the edge of my seat in some scenes, with my heart thumping. Then again, movies are a lot scarier in a quiet setting with the lights off. It also made the hairs on my arm stand up. (you can hear an explanation of why this happens in the movie).

Night Shyamalan / Cast: Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams, Donnie Wahlberg: Thrilling shocker about the inner talent of a boy who claims to see things that others cannot. Bruce Willis stars as a doctor who is shot by a patient in the film's opening. Haley Joel Osment plays a kid driven to paranoia with visions of dead people. His widowed mother is concerned and protective. Osment believes that Willis can help him but Willis lost faith after he lost communication with his wife. All of this weaves together into a shocking conclusion of truth and discovery. Directed by M. Night Shyamlan who details the plot with surprising developments while hinting the obvious. Great performance by Willis as a man trying to piece together both his home and professional life. Osment is brilliant with a power he cannot comprehend. Toni Collette plays his frustrated mother who struggles to understand her son's trauma while being made to face her own. Olivia Williams plays Willis's depressed wife who ceases to function or embrace reality. Donnie Wahlberg has a brief but pivotal role as a disturbed patient of Willis's. Great suspense shocker full of spine tingling visuals and a narrative full of ideas. It raises questions about unresolved circumstances that numb our understanding and all our senses.

The following film UNBREAKABLE is in my opinion much more tense and thrilling. Rating: 7 out of 10 (if you haven't seen THE HAUNTED) 3 out of 10 (if you have seen THE HAUNTED)",

When this movie came out it was a direct hit and brought something new to the horror genre. It was creepy, thrilling, suspenseful and yet still had that heartfelt elements. What I liked about this movie is how it didn't really on gore or jump scares to get the audiences attention. But because it brought that clever detailed build up that a lot of the horror movies now a days are missing out on. As a matter of fact this is a film that the whole family can watch without really offending anyone...Much. But it's still a really good film. The two main leads were the perfect match for this film. Bruce Willis's role as Dr. Malcolm Crowe was perfect. As a matter of fact I heard that Dr. Malcolm Crowe actually wrote the role for Bruce Willis. And Haley Joel Osment was amazing as an actor when he was little. Overall this is a great horror filmmaking and was a clever idea when it came out.",

For all first-timers (like me) who see the film fully aware of the picture's startling denouement, the question must be ""Can one still enjoy it with such a movie-spoiling foreknowledge?"" Well, as anyone who has ever seen ""The Sixth Sense"" more than once knows (and I can't imagine anyone seeing this film for the first time who would NOT want to watch it again immediately!), the answer is a resounding ""yes."" In it, Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist in Philly who attempts to help 9-year-old Cole Sear. Cole's problem, as he famously puts it, is that he sees ""dead people."" Anyway, the always likable Willis gives a nicely restrained performance here and, as ""DVD Delirium"" puts it, ""manages to keep his trademark smirk hidden."" And young Haley Joel Osment is superb as the troubled Cole, effectively communicating, with his whispered delivery, the fear that is his daily bread. The film is a quiet and understated affair, building suspense and scares through a gradual accretion of detail. It has been expertly lensed by master cinematographer Tak Fujimoto, and Shyamalan's direction is quite ingenious in the way it skips around the edges of the film's big twist while still playing the game fairly. By that famous ending, young Cole seems set to beat Jennifer Love to the punch as a ""ghost whisperer,"" while Malcolm comes to see himself for what he truly is. It's some brilliant stuff, and I for one wouldn't even mind a belated, latter-day sequel....",

I think that Shyamalan's intention was to reveal the secret at precisely the moment I worked it out, possibly by dropping an even broader hint.

If this film had been made in Britain or Europe with actors who can act, it would have been wonderful. Brucie is a 'deez' 'dem' 'doze' guy. He's always in an action film no matter what he does. He can barely read the script. The young boy in the story and his mother are great, but Willis' presence knocks them down every time. He turns what could be a nice scary thriller into comic book stuff. He's especially awful during his scenes where he has to show some emotion. One can only think of the line about early Hepburn, ""Let's go see Katharine Hepburn act the gamut from A to B."" Willis is more like 'A to A minus'. He's terrible when he talks.

I saw the Sixth Sense when i was only SEVEN, which was the time i was scared of a lot of stuff. When i went to bed that night, i didn't lose an inch of sleep. How it can be in the top 250, i don't know. The ""twist"" ending was no surprise, i kinda saw it coming. no person can be able to still walk around living after getting shot a million times by a psychotic person. The little boy was seriously annoying. he was always walking around like a ghost, and while it was ""scary"" for some people, to me it looked like he was drunk. some scenes aren't totally original either. while i was watching, i had this feeling in a few scenes, like ""What movie was that from?"" or ""deja vu"". and a few days later i happened to watch ""Tobe Hooper's Poltergeist"" again and realized what i was talking about. that scene where all the cabinets and drawers are opened is a huge, slap-in-the-face reference to Poltergeist.

The most interesting thing about this for me was that I left the film not thinking only ""What a great ghost story flick."", but also ""What a nice relationship movie!""  In fact that's what stayed with me, which is not what one usually expects from such a film.

And I can tell you, it is one of those rare movies that are really excellent (just like ""The Matrix""). I will absolutely not tell anything about the ending of the film because it is something you could have known from the beginning of the film, but I had absolutely no clue. Only one thing bothers me, why didn't Cole feel any cold in the presence of you know who? The director probably did this because otherwise the ending of the movie would already be known from the beginning of the film. Anyway, a must see film!!!!!!",
415,23 October 2015,Screen_Blitz,10, M. Night Shyalaman's supernatural horror venture makes for a thought-provoking and spine-chilling experience,"The Sixth Sense is not your average paranormal horror thriller, it is a thought-provoking with a strong emotional edge associated with its spine-chilling scares. The ingenious mastermind this supernatural horror-fest is M. Night Shyalaman who pours a heart and soul into the core of its chilling story. In an age where many filmmakers strive for both successful and unsuccessful attempts at scare with with drenching their films in an enormous barrage of blood and gore and jump scares, Shyalaman sheds away from these conventions by showcasing a story that spends chills down your spine, while grabbing at your heart with an emotional atmosphere many films of the genre are often not accustomed to. So here's the question, what if you had the ability to see spirits of the deceased? The answers lie within the grounded core of this supernatural thriller carried on the shoulders of young Haley Joel Osment as it follows a little boy lost in a world of unspeakable imaginations. There are rules, however, that must be established when bringing an eerie world of the dead beyond the grave to life. That's a generous method the Indian-born filmmaker applies to pulling audiences into an emotional jarring experience where paranoia is rampant and the lines between reality and fantasy are blurred. The film, set in Shyalaman's hometown in Philadelphia, follows Malcolm Crowe (played by Bruce Willis), a once-gifted child psychologist who is set up with an emotionally disturbed nine-year old boy named Cole Sears (played by Haley Joel Osment), a lonely boy living his misunderstood mother (played by Toni Collette). Upon meeting the young lad, it becomes clear that the boy needs help. But things become complicated when Malcolm discovers that Cole has a mysterious ability to communicate with the ghost of dead people.",

421,10 October 2016,sharky_55,7, You have to add some twists and stuff.,"The internet and young audiences have long been enamoured with this type of film that rewards repeat viewings. It's good film-making to flip the viewer onto its back and watch them question everything they have just witnessed, and what's more, twists generate discussion, which in turn generate hype. These films, in the vein of Fight Club, The Usual Suspects, The Prestige as well as Shyamalan's own The Village, all have their designated 'rewind' moments, where the bombshell twist is dropped and the realisation sinks into the characters. This is often accompanied by flashbacks that remind us visually of all the little hints that we have missed, but most find that joy in a second or even third watch. It's a bit like positive reinforcement - the viewer relishes in spotting them slyly inserted into the background or unknowingly in plain sight, and are allowed to pat themselves on the back for being so attentive.

What I got to know was the child could see ghosts and gradually even solved their problems. If one would think the poisoned girl incident and talking to passed away grandmother even this incidences can turn the movie appealing. I later got to know about Bruce Willis Secret. May be it happened because I fast forwarded and skipped the last part. Yeah my bad. It achieved even greater feat in my knowledge after knowing the actual ending.,

Of his entire body of work, only The Village and Unbreakable really stand out when originality is concerned, and they're really the only two of his movies that I've enjoyed. The major problem with The Sixth Sense is, who would have guessed, unoriginality. There is nothingminus the plot twist, I guessthat makes this stand apart from the thousands of other kid-seeing-ghosts movies that came out before it. If you've consider yourself a horror fan, and one that has seen a good selection of ghost movies, you know everything that happens here. And I mean everything.",

I think i would have liked it even better if i hadn't known what the ending was. This film is a little slow but the moments when the young boy actually came face to face with the ghost were really scary , i only wish there could have been more moments like when he met the ghost in the kitchen who he thought was his mother. The acting from the boy was fantastic even thought i hate watching child actors and Bruce Willis, was, well, Bruce Willis!.Its a film that you will want to watch twice and i'm not telling you why! 8 out of 10",
428,5 September 2020,jerrymr_lyn,9, My favorite thriller movie,"I have never seen a thriller suspense film that touches me so much.
At first glance, I only stayed on the emotional resonance the film bring to me . The boy and the doctor heal each other, and the affection between family members always makes people cry. However , in the second review, I saw more details. It is obvious that the whole movie is so complete and what you get confused at the beginning will be answered at the end.
When he was a child, Haley Joel Osment 's acting skill was too explosive. Every line and expression in his eyes, is so natural and you can really feel what he think or how he feel. Later, I also went to watch ""AI"", another film he played in where his pure eyes left me a very deep impression.
Now, let's talk about the plot. The plot of this movie is very clever and ingenious. And the ending is so exciting . At the end of the film, Cole told his secrets to her mother and the existence of her grandmother. Both generations have been blessed by family affection. There is no doubt that every mother will always love her child.
And the love between Crowe and Anna, I prefer to call it an unspeakable and moving emotion deep in heart. Finally Crowe realized the truth, from shocked, unacceptable, to despair, painful, and finally calmed down. He still accepted the truth, for he helped Cole and fulfilled his wish; he could still be there with his wife in the end.
""You are never second ever"". Despite the reluctance, in the end, they said good night to each other . Tomorrow everything will be different. The movie came to an abrupt end. . . . .",

With this film we were introduced to Shyamalan's twisted, dark, and yet highly creative mind. We got a taste of his skilled storytelling ability wrapped in his tight artistic direction. We also discovered the man's knack for twist endings. And what a twist it was. The Sixth Sense really focuses on two characters and their relationship. One is Bruce Willis' character, Dr. Malcolm Crowe, who is a psychiatrist whose current patient is a disturbed little boy named Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment. Crowe makes it his mission to help this boy, while at the same time he is trying to cope with his deteriorating personal life.

When you re-watch it though you catch why - because there's all kinds of little cheats etc that obviously make you think that ending is impossible, but they don't hold up when you already know what the ending is.

The ghosts themselves deserve an A-plus for the atmosphere they imbue, but realisticly, sixth sense perception is not that exclusive. Ghosts are not that invisible or that tangible. Some people do have greater sensitivity to them, but on a whole, ghosts can be seen by just about everyone whether they are psychic or not. The only other plot point I see unresolved is while Willis discovers the truth about himself, did Osment know it all along ? Otherwise, this is great movie for believers and unbelievers.",

445,31 October 1999,raymond-15,8, I was on the edge of my seat!,"Some people have powers of perception beyond the normal range of the five senses.  The movie explores this strange phenomenon. Most scenes in this film are dark and shadowy with the camera moving stealthily through doorways, stairways, cellars and attics.  I was on the edge of my seat most of the time not knowing what to expect next but knowing full well that there was something threatening in the shadows.  Several times I leapt in my seat which says a lot for the development of the spooky atmosphere and fine direction.  At first the story is rather confusing because not everything is revealed in the beginning.  It's a case of mental gymnastics as we sort out the clues concerning the various characters.  Bruce Willis is great and his scenes with the young boy hold our attention as we delve into the various possibilities until finally the truth is revealed.  In the opening scenes with the psychopathic intruder we experience our first shock but there are more to follow.  The psychopath shouts too much thus blurring his speech which makes it difficult to comprehend his words.  I enjoyed the argument with the school-teacher in the room which was once a court-house and the ""locked in the attic"" scene which scared everybody including the audience. To sum up:it was well acted,well directed, and sets exactly right . 	It has great entertainment value but like most stories about the supernatural not to be taken too seriously.",

453,10 April 2000,Ronny-11,10, Last masterpiece of the 20th century,"This movie really shows, that today's movies don't have to be mainstream, not-innovative, pseudo-intellectual and flat-plotted. Instead it shows, that good film-making also can be achieved by stuff, producers normally would go mad about - such a movie as ""The 6th Sense"". With no big publicity at all (at least here in Germany) this film started in December last year and went straight to #1, leaving ""block busters"" as Schwarzenegger's ""End of Days"" etc. far, far behind. The story is awesome - M. Night Shyamalan did a great job and the way HOW he tells the story and brings it to the audience reminded me of the perfection of Alfred Hitchcock; even when Cole and Doctor Crowe stand in front of a door with a knob, you just see Cole being mirrored in the metallic surface, although Crowe stands right by his side. And when the plot reveals that Dr. Crowe actually died right at the beginning of the movie and you resume Cole's words of ""I see dead people..."" it makes you shivering although the movie ended - and the impact is even bigger while watching the movie a second time. Its ""silent"" horror combined with a tragic story of both Malcolm and Cole and Willis' and Osment's overwhelming acting makes this film a real masterpiece. Not honored by the Academy at all, it just shows that the movie is too good for the Oscars - it is just not mainstream, not-innovative, pseudo-intellectual and flat-plotted, and with all these points it's no real film for the Academy; normally I see Oscars in important categories as a warning that the film is bad, and once again I have been encouraged to keep this another year; last time it was this lame mainstreamer ""Titanic"" and this time we had ""American Beauty"". Poor Academy! Maybe next time. For me the winner of the Oscar for at least ""Best Film"" and ""Best Supporting Actor"" is ""The 6th Sense"" and Haley Joel Osment.",
454,18 September 2004,OriginalMovieBuff21,9, Interesting and twisturning,"The Sixth Sense in many ways was excellent. The actors were great, Bruce Wills on behalf is good in mostly in all of his films and Haley Joel Osment, at that time was in the process of a new actor and he did great. Most kids in movies are little punks that I can't stand and are just flat out terrible at acting but Haley put up a strong performance and that's why, now he's a successful and famous actor (mostly because of this film.) The story was very interesting about a kid who sees dead people and comes to a man to seek help and they both become friends as he is trying to let the fears out of him. In the beginning of the film, I was quite confused of what was going on until the very end I was quite surprised. The ending had one of the best twists I have ever seen in a film yet. It keeps you at the edge of your chair and your like, "" Oh my god, that is so weird. All this time, throughout this movie I was wondering what was going on and now I learned. Wow, that's quite amazing."" That is what you will be thinking. The film was extremely interesting and detailing.

But let's only talk of this one.",
456,15 November 2017,bbewnylorac,8," A lush, absorbing film","Gorgeous cinematography, rich historic Pennsylvania locations and a tight, intelligent script are what elevates this film above the ordinary horror flick. It has plenty of interesting ideas. Such as, how old buildings have a human history we may not realise, for example the boy Cole's school theatre where there was once a terrible fire, and the three colonial people he sees hanging from a rafter. Cole's kitchen is taken over at night by a battered woman who shrieks and opens all the drawers. It made me think about who used to live in my house. I like the scene where the young couple shop for antique rings - who knows who once owned them? The central affliction of the film - Cole sees dead people - has parallels with sexual abuse. Cole is frightened and disturbed and he can't tell anyone what's wrong because he thinks they won't believe him. He develops little routines, like his figurines and going into a church, to get comfort. The psychologist Malcolm (Bruce Willis) hits on the idea of Cole asking the ghosts what is wrong and offering to help them. It makes you think about angry or sad or disturbed people in the real world. Maybe if someone could get down to the root of their problem, they could get help. Cole discovers that the little girl ghost who keeps vomiting is trying to tell him she was poisoned by her mother, and that no one suspected it. I thought the film could have showed more of this - Cole helping the ghosts out. Malcolm's violent former patient, Vincent (Donnie Wahlberg) is a good reminder that sometimes people's pain is so great they can't be helped. Or maybe Vincent represents what Cole could be like in the future if he is not helped. The twist at the end is a great one. Willis is allowed to demonstrate his cerebral side, and Malcolm's scenes with his estranged wife are a poignant exploration of grief, and of a couple drifting apart.",
457,24 December 2019,andrewroy-04316,8, The Sixth Sense set a high bar for emotionally driven thrillers with strong endings,"While it's been spoiled to death culturally, it's because The Sixth Sense had such an impactful twist, which has been the benchmark of thrillers since. While there are a couple frustratingly unclear plot points, the broader story, editing, and ending are all excellent. Even before the ending, Shyamalan draws the viewer in by framing it as a character-based story with Malcolm trying to correct for his past mistakes and Cole trying to get through school as the odd kid out. Osment is truly excellent and the best child acting performance I've seen, and Willis is quite good as well. The tension of how Cole will overcome his ""gift"" and how Malcolm will help both Cole and his marriage keep the energy high throughout, but it is the twist that adds layers to the movie and elevates it. There are plenty of hints and allusions to Malcolm being dead, but it's subtle enough in most of the social scenes to be not given away. I realized the twist about halfway through but was still fascinated to see how Cole's gift would be explained - why is he the only one who can see ghosts? I was really disappointed that was totally ignored. I also think it would've been much more plausible to say that the ghosts don't actually interact with the material world, as the suspension of disbelief that ghosts move things around all the time but nobody ever notices is a little tough. I think the idea of having ghosts live a dreamlike existence where they see what they want to see and are only there as long as they need to solve what was left undone in their life was brilliant and is why the twist adds so much depth to Malcolm's character. The hanging people didn't make much sense in this explanation - they don't see what they want to see and they don't have anything they want to solve, but outside of that the other ghosts followed that idea very well. It's fully deserving of its iconic thriller/twist status, and definitely has enough emotional investment in its characters to be more than just a twist based movie.",
458,30 January 2000,action-6,9, Surprisingly good!,"I wanted to see this movie because Bruce Willis was in it. I was expecting an average thriller made better by one of my favorite actors. I was extremely surprised by the quality of The Sixth Sense. This has to be one of THE movies of 1999. Bruce Willis plays a psychologist who is working with children. One night he is attacked in his own home by one of his old clients, who is now a grown-up. Willis`s character is named  Malcolm Crowe, and he is determined to never fail again.  One day he is going to see a new client: a boy named Cole Sear, who is having some kind of unknown trouble. This movie is a horrorthriller, there  aren`t that many shocks in it, but it is a well directed and exciting film. Bruce Willis manages to act without having a pistol to rely upon, and Haley Joel Osment`s performance is well-above-average. 9/10",

462,30 April 2000,jhaggardjr,8, Good thriller,"I've got an unusual story to tell you about ""The Sixth Sense"". When I first saw this movie when it first came out last August, I didn't care for it that much. Then the movie continued to make tons of money at the box office. I kept asking myself ""did I see this movie the wrong way?"" I didn't find it all that scary. When I go to see a horror film, I expect some scares and shocks and this movie didn't seem to provide that. Then this past February it got 6 Oscar nominations including Best Picture. So on the basis of that, I went back to see it a second time. And you know what? It turns out that this movie is pretty good after all. The second time I saw ""The Sixth Sense"" I saw the movie as a drama instead of a horror film and on that basis it works. The one thing I do agree on (even when I saw it the first time) is the outstanding performance by eleven-year-old Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear, the boy who ""see's dead people"". He's terrific in this film. I hope we'll see lots of him in years to come. Also terrific, Australian actress Toni Collette as Lynn, Cole's mother. I didn't even know see was from Down Under since she's playing an American. I was very happy that Osment and Collette received Oscar nominations for their performances here (I think they both should have won). Bruce Willis, who was not recognized by the Academy (unfairly), gives one of the best performances of his career as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, the child psychologist who tries to help the boy. ""The Sixth Sense"" is a well made thriller from an unknown writer-director, M. Night Shyamalan, who received Oscar nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. Too bad he had to lose both (if ""The Sixth Sense"" had been based on a novel and Shyamalan had adapted the novel to the big screen, he would have won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay; the movie didn't have a chance against ""American Beauty""). ""The Sixth Sense"" is definitely one of the biggest sleeper hits ever. Good job by all.",

I tried to overlook them and say: ""Look Anna, you're too stupid to realise that those ten or fifteen plot inconsistencies do not exist. Surely, there are a ""logic"" explanation for everything."" I failed. But as I said, I *did* like it and I was quite spooked at times, but after having seen Edward Norton and Brad Pitt and David Fincher (well, I didn't actually see *him*) in action the night before I just don't think I was ready to accept ""The Sixth Sense"" as a great movie experience. I *should* love this film, and I know that I probably would have if it wasn't for a) the boring first 45 minutes and b) the fact that I knew there was a twist. I think that if the ending had come as a *real* surprise, like ""oh-my-god-is-there-a-twist-in-this-film?!"" I would have appreciated it much more. Now I spent half of the movie looking for clues to the twist (I didn't know *what* the twist was, though).",

The rush of so many people to ascertain they had got it, shows how brilliant the script and the direction was.

But no, the story is flawless, the hints were there and everything does make sense in the end. Basically, it's so intelligently made it's intimidating, hence the reaction. Shyamalan doesn't fool you, he simply outsmarts you. To paraphrase a quote from the movie, he makes you see only what he wants you to see. This is why you have to watch this film at least twice in order to appreciate how masterfully crafted it is.",

But during the last 5 minutes, it completely changed my view and made me leave the the","Bruce Willis plays child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe. He takes on a young patient named Cole Sear (another name you'd only hear in the movies, played by Haley Joel Osment). Cole has some fear that he can't communicate to the world, but it's something that hurts him both physically and mentally and it's up to Dr. Crowe to help him. Crowe needs to redeem himself because a former patient of his didn't get the help he needed, and one night broke into Crowe's apartment, and shot Crowe before turning the gun on himself. So in Crowe's mind, helping Cole is as much about helping himself, as it is helping the child. When Crowe uncovers the mystery of Cole's fear, it makes him come to a terrifying realization about himself that changes his life forever. ",

I have waited a very long time for a movie like this to scare me, and the wait was well worth it. Bruce Willis is excellent as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a distinguished child psychologist haunted by the painful memory of a disturbed young patient he was unable to help.  Willis has had some serious dramatic roles in his long career, but none this extreme. Whoever said `Never work with kids or animals' was right in this case.  As great as Willis was in The Sixth Sense, 10 year old Haley Joel Osment stole the show with his riveting performance as Cole Sear, a frightened, confused eight year old with a similar condition as the young boy Willis was ultimately unable to help; the ability to `see dead people.'

The Sixth Sense lives up to its claim of being rather scary.  There are moments that will make you jump, and there are moments that will make your hair stand on end.  Bruce Willis is very good as the shrink who tries to help the young boy who sees dead people.  Hayley Joel Osmet is very good in his role.  There is a certain conviction to his voice and you can see it in his eyes, that he really believes he sees dead people.  The way he relates to Willis is refreshing in movies.  Most of the time, kids are either saying something smart or acting silly, not this kid.  He's tortured, and he's scared.  The film delivers the goods and even sneaks in a great twist.

Haley Joel Osment as Cole is a revelation and gives one of the greatest child performances ever, he should have got an Oscar for this for sure, his performance is truly awe inspiring it leaves the audience amazed at how this kid can engross you, the way he is immersed into his role is a way in which only Hollywoods elite like De Niro and Pacino etc can do and at only 11 years of age when filming this it is amazing.

I find it cornball when people proclaim movies as art that are all about themes and expressionism, but I'm starting to understand that feeling after my most recent Sixth Sense view. Every time I watch the movie there seems to be something new I pick up that I didn't previously notice. The story is so solid, there isn't one crack in it. To go along with such a fresh screenplay was an amazing cast that headlined Bruce Willis, which I don't think it's crazy to say that this is his best work. The Sixth Sense is more of a drama than a horror film but when the ghost scenes occurred they were terrifying and unforgiving to the viewer. On a lighter note too, it was nice to see the family dog make it through a scary flick for once. Definitely check out The Sixth Sense (9/10) because it is still worthy of a watch even if you know the twist.",

The story focuses on Cole Sear (an incredible performance by a young Haley Joel Osmont) a boy who is inflicted with constantly seeing paranormal activity. Malcolm Crowe (one of Bruce Willis' best performances) is a child psychologist who takes it upon himself to help Cole and further understand how to help him. It's a really beautifully made mystery thriller; it is wonderfully acted, seriously spooky and intelligently crafted story telling. Although you may very well know the infamous twist ending by now, it's still essential viewing and it requires multiple viewings to find extra details as a lot of the best films do! Toni Colette is fantastic as Cole's mother Lynn; a scene towards the end shared between her and Cole is one of the most beautifully paced and emotional scenes you're likely to see. She portrays the role of the mother of a troubled child extremely well; from the angry to the sick from worry and all the feelings in between. Osmont is just stunning in this; during the suspenseful scenes he is literally shaking from fear and you can't help but feel his pain and want him to feel better. Willis is brilliant; one of those sensitive roles that we have since seen in films like Moonrise Kingdom and Shyamalan's project after this one.... Also a tense and creepy music score by James Newton Howard; cementing a long lasting collaboration between himself and the director!",
489,10 April 2020,jayjaycee,9, Shyamalan's touching masterpiece,"""The Sixth Sense"" is a 1999 mystery horror drama directed by M. Night Shyamalan starring Bruce Willis and Hayley Joel Osment. In the wake of having watched ""The Others"" yesterday, I thought I'd stay in the genre and rewatch another chilling classic I consider as an example of excellent writing. Whilst I already knew about the shocking plot twist in the end upon the first time watch (thanks a lot, Doctor Cox!), I was curious about how detailedly MNS constructed his twist in terms of continuity. And man, this film is a sheer balancing act of narration as it's constantly on the brink of giving away its true nature. This is without a doubt the best movie by Shyamalan and he shows his brilliance in everything he handles. He knows to capture the quintessential melancholic nature of his magnificently perceived and superbly enacted feature oh too well. The story he has constructed with this is definitely the best one in his whole filmography. Not only does he wrap up his film properly without letting it become a mess (thank God!), before it gets there it delivers an ingenious range of genres and combines them into something unique. In the beginning, he establishes extremely well elaborated characters the audience sympathize with immediately and puts them into ... a family drama? Absolutely! It's nothing else in the first place. Dr. Crowe deals with marital difficulties all the while trying to follow his job as a child psychologist who wants to help a heavily mentally troubled boy with his problems. Doesn't really sound like a horror film, doesn't it? The best about this plot is how it only slowly introduces the horror into this already convincing drama. Before you actually have the time to realize it, it pulled off a clean genre shift in front of your eyes. I think the shift is done right after Cole speaks his famous ""I see dead people"" quote, as it then continues to narrate the story from his exact point of view. Then you're going to understand the director's true intentions. It's only creepy to a certain degree and solely mildly scary to let you experience Cole's perspective and how he gradually begins to accept his significant role. Speaking of which, the film lives from its child actor performance and gives him most of the responsibility to make this film a hit. Willis might have shown his most versatile performance and Collette is without a doubt gorgeous as always, but no one shines as bright as Hayley Joel Osment. He steals the show from everyone and is the main reason the film developed such a scary atmosphere. The way he hesitantly begins to face his fears is not only impressive, I also thought of it as metaphor. In a supernatural manner it stands for the stages of dealing with mental illness, especially anxiety states and shows how he step by step begins to cope with his disorder. In the end, he didn't only developed perfectly, the audience has also learned something from him and that's unexpectedly great. Oh, before I forget, let's not forget about the phenomenal plot twist in the end. It's such a powerful scene of letting go that didn't really make me cry, but hit me right in the emotionality. The film doesn't really make me feel depressed, it more a positive kind of sadness and melancholy that works its way through the story. Cole went from helpless to helper and taught everyone in this film something about themselves. What else am I supposed to feel? It's heartbreakingly heartwarming, least to say. All in all, this flick is a mystery drama par excellence that sensitively guides the viewer through a well done mix of mystery drama and horror and poses as a parable for facing one's fears, dealing with mental illness and even tackles loss and grief. It's near perfection and MNS's best. Oh, before I forget: Another thing I also wanted to point out is how Cole is designed. Not only do I think that he has some sort of The Shining, to me it also feels like an Shyamalanian origin story of a hero that could easily play in the same universe as the Glass trilogy. I mean, it's not impossible and it took sixteen years for ""Unbreakable"" to get a sequel. I mean, why not?",
490,29 August 1999,Adriane,9, One of the best mystery/suspense movies I have seen in a long time..,"This movie is amazing! Haley Osmont is an incredible little actor as Cole, the boy who can see, hear and talk to dead people. Bruce Willis is also very good in one of his best performances in a long time as Malcom Crowe, the child psychologist who feels the need to help Cole overcome his problem. The plot thickens at a time when you don't expect it and the ending will leave you breathless! Olivia Williams and Toni Collette are very good in their roles as well. I highly recommend this movie as entertaining, well written and directed, and well acted. More suspenseful and scarier than ""Blair Witch"". Run to the theater NOW!!",
491,9 August 2010,mnpollio,6, Solid if underwhelming work,"The Sixth Sense is a solid supernatural melodrama, whose reputation as something far better may leave new viewers underwhelmed and pondering its accolades. Known as the film that made M. Night Shyamalan a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood (a reason to be annoyed with it right there), the film is well written but follows a relatively unsurprising path up until its ""shocking"" twist climax which apparently had rather dull-witted viewers who had never before seen a film inventing superlatives to describe it. The story focuses on a young boy (Haley Joel Osment) with the ability to ""see dead people"" as the film's notorious tagline informs us and the relationship that develops between his stoic psychologist Bruce Willis and himself. There are a number of things to like about the film. It is atmospheric, solidly constructed and features a truly amazing central turn by young Osment, who is both believable and sympathetic as the beleaguered young boy. Toni Collette is also memorable as the boy's concerned mother. There are a few jolts here and there, but the film somehow never manages to be truly terrifying - largely because sharp-eyed viewers will intuit early on that the specters mean the boy no harm. On the downside, the film would be benefited from a better leading man. Even fans of Willis must admit that his cinema acting can be divided into two classes: smarmy or lifeless. The more serious the drama, the more lifeless Willis becomes. His chemistry with Osment is often as chilly as the temperature drop that precedes a ghost. In fact, the very tenor of his performance helps give away the much heralded surprise climax. One cannot discuss this film without touching on the climax - which is really the aspect that pushed this film over-the-top, but it is hard to explain why since many viewers will figure it out within the first 20 minutes and will not be the least blown away by the final revelation. The fact that the revelation really has no bearing on the plot itself or the personal outcome of the young boy's future is bad enough, but even worse is the fact that Willis' detached demeanor robs it of much in the way of emotional punch either. A good, but not a great film from a director known more now for his missteps than his classics.",

The main thing that distracted me from this movie was a constant feeling of pity for the main character in the story, a little boy.  Not only was the kid living in constant terror, but nobody believed him, and it looked like he would be locked up in a mental ward.  Focusing on the constant pain the boy was in was to me a major distraction, causing me to lose track of a lot of subtle details I otherwise would have noticed.  I didn't find the movie terribly entertaining.  However, like most others, I was *COMPLETELY* blindsided by the surprise ending - I didn't see it coming at all, and when it comes it's a real shock.  The audience in the theater I saw the movie in let out a loud, collective gasp of exhaustion and fascination when the end credits started to roll, as if they had been holding their breath for two hours.

As the terror increases, Dr. Crowe soon realizes that nothing in his world is as it seems.

Director Shyamalan fills the film with a moody atmosphere and keeps us pondering about what is going to happen next as the plot twists unfold step by step. It never loses interest even when it starts asking us to be sentimental about the supernatural. A very good film full of powerful plot twists and strong performances alongside great filmmaking.

Malcolm Crowe, played well by Bruce Willis, considers it a quest to help the boy. Toni Collette co-stars as Lynn Sear, the boys mother but it's Haley Joel Osment who steals this movie playing Cole Sear, a boy with a ""sixth sense."" A little slow at the beginning in an effort to develop the characters, but you won't have to wait long for some tense, terror filled moments that will have your skin crawling. This is NOT a film for kids under 14 years of age, in my opinion.",

517,28 January 2000,Indy-52,7, not as good as expected,"i went to this movie expecting a really good and scary masterpiece film. But, i was pretty disappointing. There were some creepy scenes in it, but of it was really boring. It was just too much ofthe same things. A ghost passes by, he says something un-scary, he walks away, the boy gets scared and tells about it to Bruce Willis. A few minutes later, the plot has completely forgotten about that particular event. It pretends that we are scared by every stupid ghost with blood coming out of his head, while we weren't. Throughout the film i thought about that surprising ending everyone had talked about, but when the end finally came, i wasn't ""surprised""at all, i knew this was gonna happen from the beginning! Therefore, i can't understand how come this movie is getting so much praise. It is truly overrated. If you're planning on seeing it, let me give you some advice: don't expect it to be as good as everyone said. Maybe you'll enjoy it more, because i thought it would be fantastic and i was very disappointed.",

You really have to take a really close look to see all the subtle clues that lead to that big revelation at the end. I also understood the subplot of the little girl better this time and the way Cole tries to help her. This movie definitley deserves to be seen twice!",
519,14 August 1999,jacksflicks,8," Good Story, Great Performance, Flawed Film","First, the bad.  Some rather glaring lapses of logic for the sake of dramatic effect:  (1) When you are scared at night, you turn lights on. Screenwriter/director Shyamalan isn't skilled enough to evoke suspense without resorting to trite devices like leaving lights off, or the ""Alien"" gimmick of uncovering horrors that logic says best be left alone; (2) when your son is locked in a dark closet by two bullies, you usually say something to the bullies, you don't just walk off with your babe in your arms; (3) the first reaction of a shrink to his patient's visions isn't ""I don't see anything"" - in the real world, the response is ""What do you see?"" (4) slow pacing, again for the sake of suspense, succeeds only in making the film drag in places. ",
520,10 April 2000,galensaysyes,4, Not good (POSSIBLE SPOILER),"As I watched this I became increasingly exasperated by its failure to go anywhere, indeed by the impossibility of its going anywhere because of the plot gimmick it saddled itself with. The gimmick is clumsily concealed, requires cheating throughout (some of which the film tries to excuse by making up its own ""rules"" as it goes), and was a bad idea from the outset, making the story ultimately silly. The construction of the script is deformed accordingly. ",

Perhaps looking for all the details that I was told I would have to see the movie a second time to catch prevented me from enjoying it.  Or perhaps, just perhaps, there really wasn't as much that was special, different, or outstanding in this movie to validify all the acclaim it has garnered.  It was boring in places, overly drawn out throughout, and had no outstanding performances by any of the actors.  There were many, MANY plot holes that were simply left to fester, and the end was a little to reminiscent of 'Ghost' for my taste.  Not a bad movie, but no better than 'Stir of Echoes,' to be sure.",

Nobody wants to spoil it for the new audience.,
523,12 August 1999,somf,9, Good old fashioned atmosphere,"We have all become so jaded with special effects and explosion a minute blockbusters that we often become restless with brilliant conventions that were used to shock us in films of the past.  These films now seem ""dated"". When thinking about the thrills in ""The Sixth Sense"".I am reminded somewhat of Hitchcock as I write this on the eve of the great one's one hundredth birthday.  But I think even more of a little known classic film,Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion"".  In it Catherine Deneuve plays a woman who is repulsed by men.  She spends a good thirty to forty minutes in virtual silence drifting into insanity, so that by the time things begin to go bump in the night the viewer is jumping out of their seat. Those who criticize the slowness of this films exposition don't seem to realize how important it is to provide the latter thrills.  But almost every reviewer agrees that the ending is terrific.  I gave this film an eight overall, but I will say that even though I've rated a lot of films with 9's and even 10's over the last few years, it is the only film of late that I truly plan to enjoy a second time. With a much different perspective I might add.",

525,2 December 2014,datorsiers2,8, A powerful movie.,"The last ten minutes really made this movie make sense, before the movie was over, i already jumped to conclusions and thought - oh, this movie seems completely illogical, since nobody ever speaks to Malcolm, Cole's mom didn't even hire him nor there were any conversations between them. Also he never had a conversation with his wife where she really spoke to him. An unusual movie for Bruce Willis, because he was in this movie i was unsure whether i wanted to see this or not, luckily i did and his performance didn't disappoint me, in my opinion, definitely one of his greatest movies. Also for a Kid actor Haley Joel Osment's acting was superb, he was incredibly mature throughout the movie, despite him being so young. It is not really made clear whether Cole knew Malcolm was dead or not, Malcolm was the only ghost Cole wasn't scared of and the only one who could help him. Through helping Cole, Malcolm found his path and accepted his death.",

Moreover, the big secret that you get let in on towards the end, is not that big of deal. I will admit, that some scenes are creepy, however the lack of any kind of supporting cast made this film rather average to me. However, the endless publicity that this film got has given it legendary status. However, I think many people have read a lot more in to this film, than was really there. Maybe it is my distaste for Bruce Willis and his other attempts at acting that are swaying me, but I don't think so. Note that I did not say this movie was bad, just not that good.",
529,19 April 2009,Gunn,9, A Director is Born and a Star is Born!,"Do not read this if you have not seen this movie. Unfortunately someone asked me a question about Sixth Sense before I had seen it and I missed out on the experience that this Masterpiece delivers to its viewers. I'll never know if I might've ""had a clue."" This film was brilliantly conceived and pieced together by M. Night Shyamalan. It was perfectly cast and Haley Joel Osment became a star through his work in this film. Bruce Willis was never better and Donnie Wahlberg was magnificent in a brief, but key role. Toni Collette and Olivia Williams and the rest of the cast all make it work so well. Being the creator of the Great Character Actors Web Page, I very much appreciate supporting actors who rarely get the credit they deserve. Finally, I see M. Night Shyamalan as the ""new"" Hitchcockian director. Although some of his more recent efforts have not been well received, I think he has a lot more surprises and ""treasures"" in store for us. Hitchcock had his ""Marnie"", ""Topaz"" and ""Torn Curtain"" yet he gave us ""Psycho"", ""North by Northwest"" and ""Frenzy"" just to name a few!",

So when I watched it a few days ago, I looked for the twist from the start.  Lets just say that if you are looking for it- its fairly easy to find- there are clues everywhere!  This took a way the shock value that other viewers may have had when the surprise ending came about.  The twist is good, and if I had not been looking for it- I probably would not have found it, or picked up on the clues.  I didn't think it was as scary as what people said.  In fact I thought as it more as a psychological drama.  Bruce Willis was particularly good in his role, and I feel it is a shame that he was overlooked in the best actor category for the various film awards.  This is a very good film, it is well written, directed acted, although not scary as such it does give you the chills in a couple of places.  Well worth seeing, and watching again.",

However, the joy is soon halted when a naked man (Well, he does have underwear.) breaks into the Crowe residence. This man claims to be a former patient of Malcolm's, and knows the roots of primitive human fear. This scene is very touching- or, shall I say: powerful? The reason for the power in this scene is because it makes us connect with the insane person inside all of us; the person who feels ashamed or angry; the guy in this scene (Vincent) is the crazy person within us.",

535,28 August 1999,andy-227,9," A fine, important piece of filmmaking.","From the trailers and the posters advertised in the newspapers, my first reaction was, great. Another dumpy special effects bonanza with CGI ghosts, no plot, and bad acting.  Just what we need.  The critics rave reviews got me interested(they should advertise the movie).  I went to see it, and was, to say the least, delighted with what I saw.  I was deeply touched by it. It's not some scary monster movie with corny acting and CGI ghosts like the remake of ""The Haunting"".  In fact, there isn't a single special effect in ""The Sixth Sense"".  Not one.  It doesn't need effects,  because it's about facing the most frightening point of our lives, death.  I walked out of the theater feeling the same way as I did when I came out of Roberto Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful"", and that was very happy.  This is the first film about death that made me feel good, and ready to accept death at the time I may face it.  ""Ghost"" is the wrong film to watch, because it made me scared of death.  ""The Seventh Seal"" was about using the time you have left to live, so that didn't have a real positive impact on me either.  ""The Sixth Sense"" did, and I was really happy about it.  Despite it's 1 or 2 Hollywood cliches, ""The Sixth Sense"" is an important film for our lives because it teaches us to face death, to accept it, and to not be afraid.  There were times in the movie when I thought to myself, why are the spirits the boy sees splattered with gore, blood, and muck?  Is this supposed to scare us? Are blood and gore Hollywood's only idea of death?  No.  It's simply the way the spirits died.  The tagline says, ""Not every gift is a blessing"".  I disagree.  I thought that the boy WAS blessed with a gift, yet he was frightened by it and he did not understand it.  I think the advertising campaign needs to rethink their methods of advertising ""The Sixth Sense"", because they make it look like a stupid special effects fest, which it is not.  I would remove some of the cliches here and there, and I still think ""The Blair Witch Project"" is the best film of the year.  Still, I liked this film very much.  I was deeply moved and touched by it.  I think it's important that people see this film.  It might change their lives!",

The performances all contribute ably to this atmosphere of quivering melancholy; certainly the dialogue is heavy-handed at times, and although the contrast of the kid's visions and Willis'	 personal pain is valid in thematic terms and broadly successful as melodrama, it also lends itself to a lot of portentous soul-searching and wallowing (which admittedly looks better when you think back on the thing with the hindsight of knowing where it's going). The movie marshals its shock effects wisely and for maximum impact, and in the post-funeral scene among others achieves an almost Blair Witch-like sense of unbearable apprehension, imminent trauma and desire to run out of the theater. Still, its commercial calculations make it ultimately less interesting than that film.",

Dr. Crowe is now handed a new case of a kid named Cole Sear which is said to have serious problems, not only at home, but also at school, and with his friends, which call him a big time freak. Cole's family background is not the best his father left and he is emotionally blocked by this, his mother is constantly depressed when confronted to her son's regular problems as well as stressed by keeping her two jobs at the same time. As soon as Crowe starts knowing Cole better, he realizes that he his no ordinary child, he has so much more depth that he could ever imagine, also Cole states that he has encounters and that he is surrounded by dead people. Dead people, How? `They are walking around like regular people, they don't know they're dead () Please make them leave.  I'm working on it.'

""The Sixth Sense"", like the earlier ""Blair Witch Project"", has become an instant horror classic, thanks largely to the wonderfully written script of Shyalaman, a heretofore largely unknown talent from the outscirts of Philly.

When he's sitting with toni collette she doesn't even look at him like he is not there, in the restaurant his wife just looks around, and once you add up all these things you realize hey he must be.............. watch it and see.

In spite of this I watched the film trying my hardest not to think about what I'd heard (i.e. trying to figure out how it was going to work out every two minutes or so) and still it was an awesome, staggering surprise at the end. Perhaps shrewder people would have found it a little trite from this viewpoint, but I had been expecting a simple horror movie, lots of running about screaming being chased by evil monsters type thing. What you get in the end, though it does provide plenty of jump-out-of-your-seat and shudder-with-fear moments, was a profound, touching, moving story about love and loss, which left me, hardened cynical old movie buff, beaming like a crazy thing at having seen such a great film, and my wife in floods of tears. A truly wonderful film, all the better for its lack of razzmatazz, the downbeat, restrained feel running through the grey-faced performances of all its excellent stars, the use of colours, the music, every aspect perfect through and through. Maybe on reflection there are a few niggling points, maybe they should have built more on how the boy sorts out his problem with the dead people and his relationship with his mother, but as an overall cinematic experience it's very, very impressive.",

590,22 October 2004,CurtMan@LVCM.com,10, The Magician: A Master At Work,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""The Sixth Sense"" is the work of perfecting deception and scenarios, of mastering the art of keeping the audience at the edge of their seat for one chilling sequence and surprise after another, and it is by and large the work of an extremely talented, conscientious, and ambitious filmmaker- M. Night Shaymalan. The premise of this ingenious thriller involves the relationship of a disparaged child psychologist (Willis) and a curious, coy, prodigal young boy who is uniquely troubled, he ""sees dead people"", and is lost as to how to embrace the spirits he encounters. Yet, being the master of deception that Shaymalan synonymously is, one cannot merely accept this as a single premise, for there is much, much more beneath the surface of this curious relationship. In viewing a film such as this and defying its deceiving premise, it is important to note and consider all of the facts throughout the film, as there are so many clues pertinent to the ""stupefying conclusion"" that the ""surprise ending"" is almost pronounced by Shaymalan, and you can hardly fault him for being unfair and disloyal to the facts, for upon review, it is the oblivious viewer who has been stumped by the subtle Shaymalan. Here is a film that provides plenty of chilling suspense, enticing dialogue, and confounding mystery, and even manages to conclude on one of the most ingenious, adroit notes in film: the filmmaker is controlling all of the shots here, and the viewer is merely following his lead! Excellent direction from Shaymalan, brilliant acting by Willis and Osment, interesting and original screenplay, and overall, an ingenious cinematic effort that is more intelligent than it seems.",

That being said, I'm a little older than Haley Joel Osment and if you saw me you'd think I look young for my age. Like there are employees at work who once guessed I was 14, and then said I look 18. 14 is a little too young, I don't think I look that young. But, to people who feel old one thing is for sure and that's not all of us age the same. Some look old for their age, while some look young. You could look at names of celebrities who don't age online and celebrities from Modern Family would come up, like Sofia Vergara/Gloria, and Sarah Hyland/Haley.

It simply is average--the pacing is awkward and plodding; there is a serious lack of tension and momentum. I do not consider myself to be a literary genius, but have all the critics of today never seen a movie with good writing? (Mostly pre 1990).

If you have not seen it yet DO NOT KNOW THE ENDING. I won't even hint at it here except to say it is one the best in movie history. This is easily one of the best 3 films of year (among The Matrix, EdTV and Thomas Crown). I had tears running down my cheeks about 4 different times throughout this film and all because I cared about the kid. Haley Joe Osment gives the best child performance I've ever seen (even topping those given in CE3K and ET and Sleepers) as a sweet and troubled child who sees ghost. He should be a lock for a nomination for best lead actor Oscar (but then again ""Shakespeare..."" won a ""best film"" Oscar last year). Bruce Willis is wonderful as a sympathetic shrink trying to treat the kid (anybody who saw ""Nobody's Fool"" will not be surprised by his work here) and Toni Collette (who?) is just right as the kid's mom. Also Olivia Williams is very fine and very beautiful as Willis's wife. Writer-director M. Night Smyamalan trusts the intelligence of his audience by giving us a screenplay as heart-tugging as ""Titanic"" or ""Field Of Dreams"". The scares here are creepy but not shocking. He's too smart for that and they work because we really care about the people in the movie. His direction is virtually perfect. James Newton Howard's score is his best since ""Grand Canyon"" and just as memorable (I can't wait to buy it). I'd heard that it was an excellent movie, but I still wasn't prepared by how good it was. The thing that really sets it apart is that for a scary movie it is touches your heart and in that respect it reminds me of ""Ghost"" (although this is much scarier) and ""Jacob's Ladder"".",

Like the Blair Witch Project this movie doesn't use tons of gore scenes instead it takes time to develop a strong story. The story is basically about getting over our fears and letting go of the past. The ending of this movie had a great unexpected twist. This movie has great imagery and an excellent spooky score. 10/10 Another great horror movie. ""I see dead people"" Cole Sear",

This one had it all:  intrigue, of course suspence, eerie atmosphere, great involved acting, and the most unique and creative angle on scary films.  Before this film I thought that it wasn't possible to have a horror flick with a plot.

But anyone touting it as the ""greatest psychological thriller ever"" has apparently never heard of Alfred Hitchcock.",

Without giving too much away, the ending is quite a shocker, and this is why I compared it to The Usual Suspects (i.e., there's something that happens at the end that has been running (nearly) throughout the film, and you need to keeps your wits about you). It was nice to see M Night in a small cameo too. No special effects, no star-studded line up, just plain old fashioned chiller thriller. Haley Joel stole the show, and Willis puts in a spirited performance as the child psychologist. The score and camera work are also commendable.",

He is so convincingly frightened, so depressingly sad that he pulls Bruce Willis up to his level, even dragging real tears from the tough guy. The directing is excellent, and the cinemetography extraordinarily beautiful for a suspense/drama. The intriguing plot and excellent acting (by Osment and Willis, anyhow) make up for the slow pace. The only standout drawbacks are the acting of Olivia Williams, playing Willis' wife, and an odd fifteen minute transitional sequence near the end in which it seems footage may have been cut to leave time for the fantastic ending. See it and you'll know what I mean.",

He starts to see a Child Psychologist to help work through is abandonment issues and learn how to communicate with his mother. During the course of their sessions, Cole confides in his Willis (Malcom) that he sees Dead people who want him to do things for him.

The Munchausen by proxy was really depressing too. I found myself crying often during it. It is one of the best movies of its type. It's probably M. Night Shyamalan's best picture.

The film is good the ending really was the best bit it just made me really cry what he says to his girl and when he realises it and accepts it just very cute. Also the film was abit scary many parts in it did manage to give me the chills and made me look behind my shoulder a couple of times it is very intelligent in the fact that I'm sure many people along with myself also didn't click onto the ending. I'm glad I watched this film it has been out for a while and I felt I was missing out when I heard people saying 'I see dead people'.

If you don't already know the plot, this is the story of a psychiatrist and a boy who sees ghosts.  M. Night Shyamalan showed true genius in the directing of this film.  I had to see it a second time to really appreciate how every detail was perfect.  When viewing the second time I was constantly thinking how could I have missed that?! Every clue was there.

This is the best movie on the big screen since Saving Private Ryan, a true winner.  Bruce Willis puts on his best show, possibly of his entire career.  Osment is the best child actor I've seen since Tatum O'Neil in Paper Moon (1973).  His ability to capture all of the idiosyncrasies of a frightened boy with the ""6th sense"", those characteristics we the naive would never think of, is unheard-of in a child actor.  This movie has it all!  It's a thriller, horror, a little comedy, romance that will make you cry.  It's like Ghost (1990), taken to another level!  It is WELL worth the overpriced tickets!!",

However, it has some weaknesses that still bother me and clearly do not make it an Oscar contender with such great films as American Beauty and Girl Interrupted.  The first flaw is not in the film, but in the trailer.  Yes, ""I see dead people"" is an enticing line, but I would have given anything to see this movie without knowing that in advance.  It really detracted from the early suspense.  And, the big surprise ending I hear about is so obvious that I thought the surprise might be that the obvious ending didn't occur (and this would have made it a better film).  Unfortuantly, the obvious does happen and they use very heavy-handed flashbacks to make sure even the dumbest in the audience get the idea.",

I've followed Haley Joel's career since his sitcom days and even i was amazed by him in this movie. he was scared he made you forget you were watching a movie and made you live it. Shyamalan provides an excellent and gut wrenching story which shows his range when you consider his prior film was ""Wide Awake"" which was a beautiful tear jerker of a film. this movie also has it's moments.

Shortly into it, however I worked out the twist which was so obvious I couldn't believe that was it. The rest of the film lumbered on extremely slowly. The music was completely over the top, it was inappropriate to a lot of the scenes. There seemed to be sub plots which did not fit in with the rest of the movie.

662,3 March 2010,johnmschofield,9, I am so glad I didn't know the ending when I watched it for the first time,I didn't have any preconceptions about this film when I watched it for the first time because I wasn't aware of anything about it at all which is remarkable in itself considering I watched it about seven years after it was released. I liked this film because it was innovative and not really that shocking but it worked for me on all sorts of levels because it was clear to me that a lot of care was taken in its production. All of those involved deserve congratulations on a job well done. The storyline was relatively easy to follow but like a lot of other people I wandered willingly up the wrong path and was pleasantly surprised by the revelation when it came. The film is about as good as the parts that make it up which means that I would give this film 9.5 out of ten but since I cannot do this I will give it a 9. When I watched it for the second time I took particular note of all of the interactions and it was then that I saw how good the film is. The central characters are strong apart from Bruce Willis who in my humble opinion didn't quite step up to the mark. I do not know enough about acting but I do know that there was something about Willis which didn't quite set well within the film. It wasn't a major flaw but the 'feel' was not always spot on. Maybe I am being overcritical here but it was my feeling. That aside it is a remarkable piece of work and I would recommend anyone watch it and fortunately it is good enough to be watched repeatedly,

You all know the story by know, and yes, there are then thousand plot holes, but it really doesn't matter when you have film-making of this standard. The direction and score go hand in hand perfectly. While the actors all give their best, most notably toni collette and haley joel osment. Osment is the films heart, with a performance easily up there as one of cinema's best. The scariest thing in the film is how the kid manages to convey his emotions so realistically. When he is scared in the movie, he genuinely looks scared, and that is no easy feat to do with a big camera pointing in your face. Bruce Willis does a good job, proving that he can actually act very well when he wants to. But he is outshone by osment, which is probably best for the movie anyway. The plot is strong, and unwinds at it's own crawling pace, but it pay's off in the end with a touching finale that makes you want to watch the whole film again. And not many films do that.",

The Sixth Sense goes with simple-fashioned storytelling.  No big sidetracks to the story and just follow the characters from beginning to end.  It's hard to describe what I think of the film's major plot points without in effect dropping hints.  All I can say is the mood isn't so scary, although it is creepy.

I really think it wasn't as good as people said but it's still a cool movie. It's more of a psychological horror movie. It will scare you but it doesn't have a lot of action. I also noticed that many scenes in the trailer are not in the finished movie. All the scenes deleted looked a little actionful. Why did they leave them out? Anyway, the plot was really cool and the script was good. The acting was great. Bruce Willis was great as usual. Haley Joel Osment was a surprise. He didn't look like a good actor but he was pretty good. The plot has to deal with a child who can see dead people but they don't realize that they are dead. I did like it and will buy it on DVD but I don't understand why people think it's the best movie of the year. It was cool but not that cool. Now for the surprise ending. I already knew it because I was stupid and asked a friend what happens. If you don't know than it will be a bit of a surprise. I actually thought it was sad. It's like a little of The Exorcist and Ghost but must people will like it. I did but I didn't think it was better than Bruce's best movie, Armageddon. The Sixth Sense: B",

And while I was sceptical as child actors can vary substantially, I am happy to report the actor does a excellent job. In fact every one of the actors does a good job at portraying their characters. The story itself is quite good and the main twist is a welcomed surprise although a bit easy to guess once you're about 60% through the film.

The whole film was built ground up from the ending, and no film has ever made it so painfully obvious that the ending was written first and then a story was added to make it long enough.  Also I have a terrible bit of information to tell everyone, Bruce Willis is really bad at acting like he cares.  It didn't work in Armageddon, it doesn't work here, and it's not going to work the next time he's cast as a truly caring man. Though in all honesty if you think about this film in great detail you realize he does not care, and is simply incredibly self-serving.  Despite all my personal distaste for this film, it is not one of the worst movies ever made, but it is nothing more than average.  The plot is relatively simple, and if you go into the theater actually thinking you'll know how the movie is going to end within half an hour.  The only real reason to see this movie is so that you can see if you can figure out the ending before the end of the film.  After you've seen this once and seen how it ends, it is incredibly unlikely that the weak plot line will be enough to draw you back for a second time.  This movie can be fun as a one-time mind quest to figure out the conclusion, but once you know the ending, this movie really has very little, if anything to offer.",

The third makes an odd, and inadequately explained, transformation of the horror story into a rather sentimental and somewhat new-age-ish tale of redemption.

I had no idea about the twists the film would take and if you read these critiques it's unfortunate that the fact that there is a twist ending is revealed. You're better off not trying to figure it out, but instead allow yourself to be transported into young Cole's world.

One, which only happens once, is the first time you see the film. Everything up until the end is basically an engrossing, yet somewhat trite thriller. The SECOND time however, your transported into another world basically as if you're watching a different movie than the first. Everything makes sense. The strange way Willis and Williams interact is masterfully explained. Religiously, the film doesn't have many boundaries, either. Uncanny acting, beautiful artistic camera techniques, smart writing, and an unusual, wonderful pace make ""The Sixth Sense"" a must-see for anybody. Definitely a close second next to American Beauty for 1999.",

695,10 November 2017,smmc16,5," ""The Sixth Sense"" The First Disappointment","""The Sixth Sense"" is the story of a boy and his relationship with the counselor that he has been seeing. The boy is troubled because of the visions he sees of dead people. The psychologist is trying to help the boy but to no avail. After the boy is able to help the ghosts he sees pass on it is revealed that the psychologist is also dead. The boy then helps that ghost move on as well. Nowadays when people talk about M. Night Shyamalan there is an air of disappointment that always seems to be present. His recent movies have not been received well, for good reason. But why aren't they good? The one consistency that appears throughout his movies is his style of storytelling. ""The Sixth Sense"" benefited greatly from his model, as it was his debut into the film industry and it might'v felt fresh as M. Night was rather unknown. Pinning ""The Sixth Sense"" as anything other than M. Night's first in a series of mediocre movies would be (in my opinion) dishonest. The only redeeming quality about this film is Haley Joel Osment's performance, and I would not accredit that to M. Night's directing skills considering his later works (""The Happening"", ""The Last Airbender""). Everything else about the movie is told in the M. Night style I have grown to resent. All of the qualities he is criticized for today are present in this movie, had this movie come out today it would not be received nearly as well.",

And then there's directing. This gets a directing nod???? this kitschy oh I dunno. It just makes me mad that this average and kitschy directing gets nominated when Paul Thomas Anderson does not. And finally Toni Colette. She annoyed me the whole film. Every scene with her was like the ultimate proof of what I said before. (though that might have been her dialogues as well, butr even then, just look at Angela Bassett in Strange Days to see just how overblown and absurd dialogue can still be made great - Can you imagine 'I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all' sound believable?

I think one of the reasons it has achieved such popularity is because critics everywhere decided to write it as being brilliant.  Viewers think they should love it, so they agree to.  I can remember sitting in a theatre several months ago and being very disappointed in this film.  The Blair Witch Project did a lot more for me.  Willis does not do all that great of job in it.  The kid (his name fails me) does. The script was OK.  The directing was actually poor.  I won't give away the end, for the two or three people who have yet to see it, but I will say that the director gives it away by the end of the second act.  When I went to see it, I knew how it would end with about a half hour left.  This disappointed me. The thing was blocked poorly and the camera could have been used more effectively to keep the viewer in the dark.  The thing felt like it was shot before it was really fully conceptualized.  Also, there were many moments where I found myself wanting the film to be more graphic and frightening than it was.  I get the feeling they were aming to get the PG-13 from start to finished.

I'm not going to pull out the ""I guessed the twist in the first five minutes"", even though I did and was quite underwhelmed by the ending. However, I came in knowing that there was some big twist at the end, so I'm not sure if I would've guessed it so quickly if I didn't. And besides, basically everyone else who doesn't care for this movie has already said that. My main problem with this film is that it is not scary... like at all. As someone who has seen real horror on their television screen (The Blair Witch Project, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, both Suspirias), I am thoroughly disappointed when a movie confuses ""scary"" with ""constant jumpscares"". Sorry Sixth Sense, but you can't try to frighten me with loud noises and sudden visuals and expect me to call you good. However, I do think that the acting and plot itself until the ending were very good, interesting, and engaging. It's definitely not a bad film, just a very overrated one in my personal opinion. If you're looking for a compelling supernatural drama, I would go for this. But if you want an actually scary movie, please look elsewhere.",
709,22 August 1999,Brad K.,9, Brilliant and Creepy.,"I had heard so many positive things about The Sixth Sense that I was sure I was going to be disappointed.  To my surprise the film lived up to all of the hype I had heard.  Haley Joel Osment (Bogus, Forrest Gump) stars as a troubled young child who sees dead people and is constantly haunted by them. Bruce Willis (Pulp Fiction, Die Hard) plays the child psychologist who is trying to help him.  The film is so much more than a ghost story its a well-written and subtle approach to what would be a child's worst nightmare. Bruce Willis (an underrated actor) gives a fine subdued performance.  You won't be amazed by what you see, but his low-key approach to his character is exactly the way it should be played.  And young Haley Joel Osment delivers a superb performance on a very difficult role especially at that young age.  I might be going a bit overboard, but hopefully this performance will not be ignored when Oscar time comes around.  Also, Olivia Williams (Rushmore, The Postman) as Willis's wife and Toni Collette (Velvet Goldmine, Muriel's Wedding) as Osment's mother are both great in support.  The big surprise however is a completely unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg (Ransom, Never 2 Big) in a powerful one-scene role.  Highly recommended film.",

He shot Dr. Malcolm and killed himself but then, not only had Dr. Malcolm failed him when he was a kid, his death doesn't help on that.

What was the lasting emotion or thought on the movie?  The whole movie seems to center around Bruce Willis trying to get inside the kid and get him to accept him. Seriously, this takes up almost three fourths of the movie.

The buzz deep inside you when you see a film so brilliant that no star rating, any review, anything could possibly convey how absolutely superb the film was. Well The Sixth Sense gave that feeling for the first time since I saw Death in Venice a while ago. Anyhow, the plot sees Bruce playing a child psychologist and a year after he is shot by a disgruntled patient in his home, he takes of the case of Harley Joel Osment, who has the sixth sense of the tile: the ability to see the ghosts of dead people. After Color of Night and Mercury Rising, the prospects of Willis playing a shrink AND working with a child are not good, but he is perfect for the role. Gone are is usual action man histrionics and instead he underplays the role calmly and gives a performance that is worthy an Oscar nomination at least. Child actor, Osment is superb too and mixes his role with sympathy, fear and desperation that put his performance among the child greats. ""Brat"", doesn't even come into the equation. As superb as they are, the most credit has to go to writer/director M. Night Shyamalan who skillfully handles his intelligent script and comes up with a chilling atmosphere throughout the film as well as several electrifying shocks, based on relatively simply situations.

The twist is so shocking, I will avoid the overwhelming temptation to give it away, watching it in ignorance will ultimately have the best effect.The cast is superb, Hollywood superstar Bruce Willis gives a refreshing change of pace performance as award winning child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Joining him is the critically acclaimed child actor Haley Joel Osment, last seen in Artificial Intelligence. The acting talents of this young boy are phenomenal, I have never seen such powerful presence, he is mature beyond his years.Haley thoroughly deserved recognition in the form of an Oscar nomination for his role as 'Cole'; a gifted young boy with the exceptional ability of having the sixth sense. Possessing this gift however only serves to create fear in the mind of a nine year old, and scepticism in everyone around him. Cole experiences terrifying, unwanted visits from the spiritual world, which inevitably leads to his social isolation. Dr. Crowe recognises Coles behaviour, and remembers many years back when he had a patient with the same symptoms. This patient however left a painful impact on his conscience, as he was unable to help. Dr. Crowe then seeks to redeem himself by doing everything in his power to help troubled Cole.As Cole is alone in seeing and hearing these suffering spirits, it is also he who must help them rest. To do this Cole must confront his nightmare. It is only with Dr. Crowe's suggestion to listen to them, he makes the discovery that they are not there to haunt him, but instead only want his assistance in their unfinished business.With the riveting intensity you'll find thoroughly chilling and utterly forgettable, The Sixth Sense is a must see movie.The 2 disc collectors edition has wonderful special features, including exclusive interviews with the cast and writer/director.",

729,29 July 2019,dreamingescapist,8, They don't have meetings about rainbows.,"M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Sixth Sense' is one of those movies that can keep you hooked on the screen even when you have seen the film several times, and you already know the big twist. Thanks to that, you can notice some new details, and thanks to that you can see some scenes from a totally different perspective than for the first time. I watched this movie again for over ten years, and I have seen it many times so all the story with its foreshadowing and twists is very familiar. I can say, I know the film by heart. This time I found more interesting how the movie is put together. The haunting atmosphere that is created mostly by what is not shown, or said and the avoidance of the jump scares. There is always something ominous, something threatening beneath. We know it is a ghost story, yet the most unnerving is when we can't see them. And when there is an appearance by one of the deceised, we get a quiet buildup for it. When the ghost is shown it isn't there to scare the audience to jump from their seats. Although, these scenes are quite chilling. What I found fascinating in this supernatural thriller, is the characters and the very human drama between them that itself can offer as many chilling and soul touching moments as the ghost story.",

737,9 November 1999,Rod-54,6, Weak plot but weirdly affecting,"I thought the plot in this film was terribly weak and Bruce Willis's acting flat.  Moreover, given the sinister overtones, his face is too cherubic and ungrizzled, seeming to smirk in serious scenes.  Before seeing this film I had been told there was a big twist at the end but I did not know what it was.  All through the film I tried to guess.  I came up with the final twist but rejected it a couple of times.  It is just too incredible.  Now that is saying a lot when the two premises on which the film is based are that some people can see and commune with ghosts while others cannot and that ghosts can move physical objects.  All that said, there is something affecting about the film.  When I left the cinema the world seemed surreal.  For some hours I felt literally uncertain about the people I saw around me and the motives for their behaviour.  A weird experience.",

If you like mysterious dramas with twist endings, then you would love this film, otherwise than that, you might think it's a little dull.

739,21 September 2019,Abhinav009,9, Be patient and you will be rewarded,"The sixth sense is described as the movie with probably the most effective plot-twist in the history of horror cinema. The movie begins and proceeds with a very lethargic pace, and at times gets a bit too slow. But it doesn't let that affect the tension building that goes on and succeeds to keep us engaged. Cole(Haley Joel Osment), the kid, proves a worthy selection for his role. Bruce Willis with his calm demeanour as the psychologist is equally convincing. As the story moves towards its last nine minutes and one begins to judge the story, Bruce discovers something, something that changes the entire movie until then, and beyond. That's right -the last nine minutes reward us for our patience.

No, not *that* ending (everybody knows this is a film with a twist, though I certainly mean to respect the tradition of not revealing it for the sake of first-time viewers).  It's the gooey, feelgood sentimentality of it.  What possessed Shyamalan, who's written a literate, well-paced, thoughtful and heartfelt screenplay, to tack on this gloopy, over-optimistic, neatly resolved conclusion for the young hero Cole? Very disappointing. I also think it was a bad mistake to cut the originally-shot final scene (available as an extra on DVD and at least one VHS release), which rounds out all the sequences we see on video - left feeling rather redundant in the final cut - and provides a more emotionally complex ending.  Maybe one day he'll see the error of his ways (and the studio will see an opportunity for more big bucks) and issue a revised Director's Cut restoring his superior first thoughts.",

After all, the boy was seeing things that other people couldn't see. Even we as an audience couldn't see. And it's hard to sympathize with this kid if we don't understand what scares him. But we got to see it about 30 minutes into the movie. The images presented to us were sometimes scary, as the deceased people the boy claims to see are in the state they were when they died. E.g. A boy who played with his father's gun, misses the back of his head. In the end comes the surprise you wouldn't have guessed if you tried.

This is a ghost story in league with The (original)Haunting (1963), The Uninvited, The Changeling, etc. It relies almost solely on the power of the actors to render its chills. There are still some genuine jolts--my wife practically broke my arm at one point as a mysterious figure swished by the lens. Bruce Willis is his most un-Bruce like, and he's great: soft spoken, gentle, emotional. Haley Joel Osment is the real thing--not a ""child actor"" but a warm, human, frightened little boy.

Night Shyamalan (who also wrote the screenplay). Malcom Crowe (Willis) is a child psychologist, and Cole (Osment) is Malcom's latest patient. I won't reveal anymore of the plot, as I feel less known about it the better. The film has a tremendous amount of atmosphere that oozes out of the screen, engulfing your every sense. There were at least two scenes that made me jump! And the film also has some rather funny moments, namely the video camera scene. If you never thought Bruce Willis was a very good actor, your mind will definitely be changed after seeing his excellent portrayal of Crowe. Australian born Toni Collette shines as Cole's Mother. And Haley Joel Osment brings shame to almost every other child actor in a film. He truly is a gifted actor, and I look forward to watching his career blossom. Much has been said of the films ending, and I don't dare say anything about it. Only that it is truly amazing. In the future I feel this film will be looked on as a landmark in cinematic brilliance in every aspect. 9/10",

OK, this one's kind of obvious and I figured it out at the scene M.Night Shyamalan wanted to cut, but I didn't want to believe it and the movie is too contrived for you to wanna believe it either,(the perception of Bruce Willis' character can only carry on so much before it's obvious the ending is what made the movie!) I feel sorry for the people who didn't figure it out or went into this movie with expectations (which no one should ever do.) A lot of cutting went into this one,a lot of it good, some of it malicious! But the movie deserves the praise given it. It's obvious that it's a one trick pony, but it's good one!!!!

783,12 July 2000,BuddyBoy1961,9," But for the supernatural element, tone is similar to ""Kramer vs Kramer""","Here is an unexpectedly poignant and utterly unpretentious ghost story. Bruce Willis is understated but effective as a child psychologist who is compelled to redeem a past failure by counseling a troubled 8-year-old boy who eventually professes to being able to ""see dead people"". Never gimmicky or over-the-top, ""The Sixth Sense"" presents us with three very real people: Willis, the boy (Osment) and his mother (Collette), each trying to cope with a unique personal trauma. Not unlike ""The Exorcist"", the film draws us into the characters' dilemmas by devoting much of its first half to letting us empathize with the leads and share in their lives, then compelling us to experience their mounting turmoil. But unlike so many horror films of the past 20 years, ""The Sixth Sense"" unexpectedly eschews cheap shocks and gore for simple, potent drama and the painful revelations that accompany life and death. The three leads are uniformly excellent, but it is Willis who surprises; never in his career has Willis relied so predominantly on the subtlest of facial expressions to convey his emotional state, and here he accomplishes this vital feat admirably.",

But that difference, that altered state, manifests itself in, to use Cole's phrase, the prickly things on the back of your neck.

786,19 September 1999,Twillhead,8, Bruce Willis' BEST Acting Endeavor on Film . . .,". . . and Haley Joel Osment is a wonder. If both of these actors are not nominated for Academy Awards (and BOTH in the Best Actor category) then Hollywood is indeed a screwed up town. Willis' portrayal as the tormented child psychologist Malcolm Crowe is sensitive and compassionate, a beautifully realized, complete performance. And Osment's performance as the disturbed child Cole who has ""the sixth sense"" is astonishing--in my opinion, it's the best performance by a child actor in film since Patty Duke in ""The Miracle Worker"". The wonderful relationship that evolves between Malcolm and Cole is worth the price of admission alone. Also kudos to Toni Collette as Cole's ever-loving, always supportive Mom; to Olivia Williams as Malcolm's wife (in hindsight, one realizes that Williams pulls off an incredibly difficult technical piece of acting), and Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent, the anguished, tortured young man whom Malcolm could not save. I've seen the film twice now--blown away by it the first time, enjoying how well-crafted it is on the second round. The evil-spirited side of me was also looking for some hole, SOMEWHERE, in the film when I saw it again, but if a hole exists, I can't find it. Brilliant, disturbing, evoking laughter, tears, chills, and a great deal of thought, this is great film making.",

It's a beautifully made afterlife movie that has everything but angels and harps, and there's a lot of subtlety and atmosphere in the score. The script is chilling, smart and poignant, and the story with a stunning ending (easily one of the best and only fully believable endings in Shyamalan's films) is simplicity at its best. Shyamalan's direction is superbly controlled, which is just what this story needed. Hayley Joel Osment plays perhaps his best role here, though he's great in AI as well, while Toni Collette plays the troubled mom very convincingly and Bruce Willis is moderately quiet and thoughtful.

 The acting is superb especially by Haley Joal Osment who plays Cole Sear. Such amazing acting from someone so young. Fantastic acting, as predicted from Bruce Willis, who plays doctor Malcolm Crowe, and also from Toni collette Lynn sear. 
The story grips you and as the story unfolds, it surprises you quite few times with a lot of moments that leave in in shock. 
The most shocking part of the film is the ending and I don't know anyone that saw it coming. It is defiantly a massive twist that know one would ever guess. There are clues of in the film leading up to the twist, but they are not something most people would spot. The clues are shown in the film, and it is a moment when you say to yourself ""oh I get it now"".

793,8 May 2001,RueMorgue,9," Amazing film, with a truly amazing ending.","To be honest, given some of the work that Bruce Willis has done in the past, I wasn't at all interested in seeing this film after watching the various trailers.  In fact, I wasn't even one of the people in line at the video store the first Tuesday it was available.  Even more surprising, I didn't see this movie until it was available on video for almost two months!  It wasn't until many friends told me I absolutely had to see it that I caved in and rented it.  Seeing this film again just last week brought back a lot of memories with the second viewing, and I felt that I should add my two cents (six cents?) into the mix here.",

Night Shyamalan, I'll get right to the point of my review: no, Sixth Sense is not a good movie.  It is a mass of poorly-joined, generally pointless fluff, punctuated by a hilariously-contrived and completely predictable ""twist.""  This is unfortunate, because due to the weakness of the material surrounding it, the entire production sinks or swims on the strength of that one plot twist.",
796,19 August 1999,niteman,9," A haunting, beautiful movie.","The first thing I noticed about the movie was that the music was creepier than even the X-Files theme, which is a definite accomplishment.  The second thing was that M. Night Shamlyan's has a great eye for setting up shots and knows exacly when to end a scene.  The third thing was that my heart was pounding and I could barely breathe.  There are some truly unsettling, suspenseful scenes here, all centering around an amazing performance by the movie's 11-year-old star.  ",

The director did not pull any punches, the second time through the movie, I was flabbergasted that I had made assumptions the first time through and therefor made the same mistake as the doctor. Haley Joel Osment is fantastic and very convincing in this movie. Bruce Willis does an outstanding job also, but the show is stolen by Haley. The movie gives rise to a sequel or a fall season series.

Bruce Willis gives an amazing performance as Dr. Malcolm Crowe and Haley Joel Osment as eight-year old Cole Sear. I mainly liked it because it was so original. I got pretty freaked out with the vomiting little girl and the wife in the kitchen! There were some very humorous scenes, i loved the part when the big-shot actor of Cole's school Tommy Tommasimo got the part of the village idiot in the school play. And Cole finally realizes why he was given this gift. I'm not going through much detail cuz that would take too much of my time. But anyone who though ""The Sixth Sense"" was dumb needs to be shot in the head several times and they obviously have bad taste in thriller/drama movies. Go see ""The Sixth Sense"" tonight!",

So maybe Haley Joel Osment didn't win an Academy Award and the film itself didn't get an award for ""Best Picture"" but this movie fails to disappoint. It truly shows what Child Psychology is like today and Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment are a great team on the screen.

This one has everything you need and gives you a film you'd be proud to take your mother to.  There's no sex scenes, no needless violence, any violence in it is part of the story. The Sixth Sense is one movie that could have been made in the 1940's.  That is how good it is.  On first viewing I admit, I was a little bored on the seemingly slow pace, but in the end you find out why some of the characters behaved oddly and it all comes together and on a second viewing you can truly appreciate the need for the pace of it.  Do not miss this one, you will not be able to forget it.  Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment are fantastic and Olivia Williams as Willis' wife, I especially loved the performance of Toni Collette as Cole's mother.  I hope to see more of her.

And if neither of them surprised or shocked you, then you will know how I felt after watching this trash. There is nothing scary, enlightening or moving about this film.

It is much more than that. It is a movie about a kid who sees dead people, but it is also a film that shows us how lonely children can be and how a divorce can effect a child's life. Haley Joel Osment plays Coal, a recent victim to his parents divorce. Coal is a very lonely child, as we see throughout the movie he has no friends and he always gets picked on.

Young Haley Joel Osman is the carrying force of this film and succeeds  in receiving lots of empathy for his unhappy, fearful condition. Many scenes of this film are touching, and some scenes startling and slightly disturbing, but for the most part this film has been dumbed down to achieve maximum audience and profit. The good craftmanship of the film makers is being wasted in the director's lack of strength in his vision and edge. This is such a neat package of ""horror"" for cinematically uneducated and undemanding from a nice, compromising Spielberg school of directing. ",
825,29 March 2000,joave,10, WOW!,I was really looking forward to viewing this movie. I read reviews and other good things that people said about it. As I started watching the movie I was intrigued by the plot setup and let the movie sweep me away. The only negative thing I can say about it is that about 3/4 of the way through it I was wondering to myself why people liked it so much. It just seemed to bog down a little. Then the ending came. It just blew me away. I now can't wait to see it again to view it in the new perspective. I truly believe that it needs to be watched at least twice. Check out this marvelous movie. I am glad I did.,

There aren't too many jump out of your seat scary moments but the overall tone of this movie was dark and kinda creepy. Bruce Willis is a psychologist that works with children. The opening scene is intense when a former patient has broken into his house and i thought it was a great way to start. Haley Joel Osment is a big reason why this movie is so good. He plays a kid, Cole, who has issues (the main one being he can see dead people). His friends, or classmates rather, call him a freak. Cole has never told anyone he can see dead people.

841,2 July 2018,nadeeshantennage,9, Kinda made me feel like maybe 'the others (2001)' adapted this concept of Shyamalan's mastery.,"If you are ready and up for a supernatural horror film which would keep you at the edge of your seat all the way through the running time with boosted and unnecessarily frequent jump scares, 'The sixth sense' wouldn't serve you right.
But instead if you are looking for an intelligent adaptation of supernatural elements about the 'dead' this is a must watch for you.
The film comes to life majorly because of the incredible performance by Joel Osment as Cole sear whose fear seasoned with anguish is deeply reflected through his eyes almost everytime he's on the screen which lets us understand his psychological fear in a more personal sense.
Bruce Willis who plays Malcolm Crowe gets an incredible standing out kinda twist in the climax of his character's arch which is the turning point and the big exposing scenario of the supernatural concept which is adapted in the film.
Even in her small role as Cole's mother Toni Collette shines with a emotionally boosted performance which inflicts the pain of a conflicted and stressed out single mother to the viewers.
The film which maintains its grip by keeping viewers invested with a good momentum of a few scares and thrilling sequences climaxes with an unforgettable and an unpredictable climax which would remind many of the horror genre lovers of the 'the Others (2001)' climax.

First I must give kudos to the director. I have not seen anything he'd directed, or written prior to this, but he's proven with one movie that he's great in both fields. The direction of the film is marvelous. He creates an air to the film, it creeps you out, and may even scare you. He does this without millions of dollars in special effects, he simply does it with make-up, a great script, and great direction. The script isn't great just because it can creep you out however, nor is it the marvelous ending, instead it's the fact that the script plays the viewer like a piano. The writer/director makes us make these simple assumptions. Little things. Things so common that they don't need to be said, and then he has us slapping our forehead for making the assumption later. It's an excellent example that nothing is what it seems, and we should never assume. Truly excellent.",

I believe anyone who gave this any higher rating than 7 must have only seen it once. This film cheats you into believing something, and at the end you are left with a revelation of sorts that keeps you thinking for hours after you've seen it. I wondered to myself for hours exactly how I had been fooled into thinking Bruce Willis' character, Dr. Crowe was really alive throughout the film. The next day I decided to see it again, and this time I realized how so many people had been fooled into this ""revelation."" There are a couple scenes that deliberatley set the tone for Dr. Crowe's daily life in between meeting w/the kid. When he is ""late"" for his anniversary dinner with his wife, we see Dr. Crowe make eye contact with her, she appears to look up at him angrily, sigh loudly and then walk out of the restaurant. In another scene when Dr. Crowe comes over to the kid's house, his mother appears to be knowingly setting up a meeting between the two. She says something to the nature of ""it's only a 30 minute session."" My point is that although this was a beautifully crafted film, just about anything involving Tak Fujimoto will be, there is a major flaw in the deliberate attempt to misguide the audience. If you have only seen this film once, watch it again for this reason, just try to pick out the times Dr. Crowe is made out to be a normal functioning person. The big ""suprise"" end will be coming from a mile away the second time. Most great films get better with continued viewing, but this one just gets stale. Overall I give it a 7.5/10.",

I can't picture putting any type of horror movie, psychological, supernatural, or any other type, on my list of top movies.  I would be hard pressed to give this movie a 5.  What ever happened to the classics, what ever happened to the movies like Double Indemnity, and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, or incredible films like The Best Years of Our Lives?

I remember almost every single one of them as well, but I don't think I've ever seen a movie with such incredibly brilliant ending. The movie is worth watching for the ending alone. Don't miss this movie. You'll regret it, I promise.",
853,17 August 1999,joey-47,10, A brilliantly done journey into the supernatural.,A word for all who haven't seen The 6th Sense:  You will not know anything about it unless you see it.  The trailers really don't reveal anything.,
854,2 April 2000,Flints,8, Best Story of the Year,"I suppose we should have figured it all out, those of us who view at least two or three films a week - but?",
855,10 September 1999,twltzone,10," M. Night Shyamala, I'm sure that Rod Serling smiles at you from the Twilight Zone!!","I think its fair to say that Rod Serling would've loved this film. Trust me, ""the twist"" is an honest to God ""twist and 1/2!""",
856,21 January 2006,fasttricky,9, ****Fantastic film****,"This is a great film from beginning to end. M. Night Shyamalan has captured the eerie mood of this film perfectly. His casting with Hayley Joel Osment as Cole and Bruce Willis as Dr. Malcom Crow, Toni Collette as Cole's mother work so well together. Bruce has thrown his blood stained vest in the garbage to do this role, he is utterly believable. I never once thought about his famous catchphrase from his Die Hard film, Yipee Kie hey Mother ******! Hayley Joel Osment is such a great actor beyond his years, it is the first film I have seen where a child actor totally captures such an emotional role. His eyes, face say more than his words, Hayley is a fantastic actor and I hope to see him in more films soon. Toni Collete I think is brilliant in the role of Coles mother she is captivating and has such a fantastic screen appeal. The story has a twist at the end which I think is clever. Overall this film gets 9/10.",
857,17 January 2021,andrejnjezic,10, Horror taken seriously,Good writing. Good story. That's all what you need to know. Watch it,
858,18 November 1999,MissTRious,10, So much better than Blair Witch,"I will confess from the onset that I am a Bruce Willis fan, there I've said it and I'm glad I've said it. The reason for this admission is that I was biased towards this film prior to seeing it.",
859,21 December 1999,benz0325,8, Great film!,"The Sixth Sense did to me what The Haunting(1999) didn't even come close to doing, scare me.  What a thrill is was sitting in the theater not knowing what was coming next.  This was a great piece of film-making. It was nice not being bombarded with special effects but rather letting the inference of ""something"" not ""normal"" create the suspense in the movie.",
860,29 January 2000,Tobbes,9, A masterpiece...,"When I came to the cinema to watch this movie, I knew nothing about it. This fact turned out to be ideal for watching this movie. On the first look, you don't really know where to put this film. Is it a thriller or a movie about the problems of a psychologist? In the middle you think its a really good horror-film. After all i think its a great mix of all that and this is the fact that makes this movie one of the best I have seen during the last years, both in the genre of thrillers an of psychological horror-films. One fact that makes this movie a great one is the end, which you wouldn't suggest. I won' tell anything about this or any other content of the movie, because this would destroy your experience. After the movie was over and I started to search for logical errors in it, but there weren't any. There not many movies of which you could say this, but this is one.",
861,21 August 2021,chacy-82000,10, Still a great movie,Still love watching this movie. One of those movies that was great then and is still great now. One of my fav films !!!,
862,11 January 2003,kameleontti,9, Best Ending Ever,"Wonderful! I had to watch this movie twice to fully understand it, but it was clear that the plot is well constructed. Good thing with the characters is that they are realistic, not clearly ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"", and sometimes people are not like the way they seem to be. Music was used well, it highlighted the excitement without being consuming. The ending was really something new - I only wish I would have been the one to invent it! Lucky writer...",
863,14 February 2003,tazmaniac80,9, Chilling stuff,"Ok, most of you probably know the twist ending, but all the same I won't spoil it for those of you that don't. I usually hate horror movies, as they tend to be gory, cheesy films with actors that can only bat their eyelids and scream. This is totally different. For a start, i didn't find it at all scary. Some parts ore slightly gross, and the whole film is eerie and chilling. It is very well acted, and has the only child actor that can actually act (Haley Joel Osment). Even if you have seen it before, or if you know the ending, it is still worth watching.",
864,7 July 2017,psufan-64278,10, Flawless,"The first thing I did when reviewing this is click the spoiler box. It is so hard to review this without talking about them. This movie is truly amazing, from start to finish. First off, the acting is great. Bruce Willis killed it, as someone who was a traditional action movie actor, who thought he could pull off such a dramatic role like this. And Haley Joel-Osmont, probably the best child performance of all- time. This movie is creepy, dark, depressing, and by the end peaceful and comforting. It truly hits so many emotions. The ending with was superb, maybe the greatest twist ending of all-time. It had context, it added to the story. So many twist endings just reveal something we assumed was true, but serves no difference to the plot of the movie. This ending simply makes sense, and after the reveal you feel almost idiotic for not noticing it (which shows how great the production was). You wonder why Malcolm's wife is so rude, why he is so obsessed with this case, and ""what is Cole talking about when he says they 'walk around like regular people, they don't know they're dead'."" Then WHAM! just like that, ""OMG Malcolm was a ghost the whole time"". Cole explains how they only see what they want to see, how they are here to finish business (Malcolm not saving Vincent), his wife is so rude because she doesn't even know he is there. Maybe you could argue, that if they only see what they want, why didn't he see his wedding ring on his finger....OK maybe their are some plot holes. But still this movie is incredible, the ending sends chills down my spine. After rewatching it, I can't help but wonder how I didn't see it coming.",
865,10 August 1999,cheeze71,9, creepy but has plot holes.,"I admit that this movie is very dark and creepy, the emotional elements are good and the actors are good, especially the child actor Haley Joey Osment. I just fully believe in his character. He acts naturally, not the ""trying to appear mysterious"" type.  Also, it is the type of movie that make me feel uncomfortable and keep thinking afterwards. However, there are too many plot holes. I just don't understand why some ghosts can move things and some can't, why some ghosts can't see/realize their own wounds... The atmosphere is great though. Also, ghosts that walk pass like normal are much horrible than ghosts which just look scary & dangerous. The story makes me feel depressed too.",
866,3 April 2000,Morgan-10,10, A really good movie,"Wow, I finally saw this movie on video last night and it was great.  The story-line was fantastic and the acting was also top notch.  It had good suspense and just the right amount of creepiness.  It had me right until the end.  It's definitely the kind of movie you talk about after.",
867,13 March 2000,buff-18,8, Good...not Great!,I was surprised to see the Sixth Sense nominated for best picture. It was a very very good movie but no where near good enough for this award. The ending was very well done. Bruce Willis was nothing special but the little boy (I forgot his name) was convincing!,
