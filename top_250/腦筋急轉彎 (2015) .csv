0,26 September 2021,pickle-92642,9, Classic for the new generation? Yes!,"I just knew this was gonna be amazing. Such a great idea for an animated movie, even by Pixar's standards. It's truly a perfectly executed vision that did not disappoint on almost all levels. There's a lot of fun to be had with this, it's one of the funnier and more thought provoking Pixar movies. The scene where Bing Bong disappears is also extremely sad. I could also tell that this is one of Pixar's more mature films, about the struggles of growing up. It explored Nostalgia for most of the movie without even using the word. When sadness touched a core memory and turned it blue, it was a symbol for Riley feeling nostalgic for her best memories. In my book, this is yet another Pixar classic.",/

2,24 July 2015,TheLittleSongbird,10, Pixar's best film since Toy Story 3 and one of their finest overall,"Most of Pixar's films are wonderful (short films too), and while the three films made after Toy Story 3 weren't up to their top standards they were still better than most animation companies at their worst. Inside Out was nothing short of a masterwork, Pixar's best since Toy Story 3 and one of their best overall.",e
3,26 June 2015,matthewssilverhammer,10, Best Pixar Since Toy Story,"After some ho-hum years and too many sequels, Pixar is back and better than ever with Inside Out, a boldly unique animated film that renews our faith in what a giant studio can do with an original concept. Docter combines the strengths of his two Pixar masterworks here: the endless inventiveness of Monster's Inc. and the poignant strength of Up. A truly fantastic mixture of fantasy-adventure-comedy and small-family-drama, it's a genius work of conception, execution and emotion that will go down in the annals of Disney animation as an instant and enduring classic. It follows Joy, the leading-emotion of an 11-year-old girl, as she tries to navigate a big change in her young life. Much like Toy Story 3, we're shown the inherent difficulties of growing up through a fresh viewpoint, learning what makes you ""you"". It's a convoluted idea that's nearly impossible to explain, and yet Pixar nails it, perfectly shifting between its parallel universes with ease. The humor throughout will undoubtedly have kids and adults in equal stitches, with fantastic turns from everyone, notably Poehler, Smith, Black, and Kind. However, this film's high-point may be the multiple emotional gut-punches that will reduce parents to tears. That fearlessness to be gloomy is basically the thesis of the film: true joy comes when every emotion is allowed to be recognized and dealt with healthfully. It's quite a psychologically complex stance to take for a film that manages to be so kid-friendly. This wonderful balancing act helps make Inside Out worthy of the ""M"" word (masterpiece) and gives it the distinction of being Pixar's best since the unparalleled Toy Story.",v
4,28 May 2017,Sweetigal85,10, A brilliant depiction of adolescence,"As an adult, I love animated films but the trailers made this one look like it was really just for kids.

5,31 March 2019,Reckno64,10, The fact that this movie has so many 1 star reviews is proof that there is no point in making great movies anymore......,"I hate to see so many 1 star reviews claiming this movie was ""too depressing"". Everyone who said that missed the point completely. Growing up ain't all sunshine and rainbows, it comes with a lot of hardships and that's what this movie is about. Riley's emotions try to help her through the difficulty of moving to a new place that isn't all its cracked up to be, and in the process Joy accidentally sends Riley into a deep depression. Sounds depressing, but what makes this movie great is how realistic her depression feels as Joy and Sadness try to help Riley out of it. I feel like this movie's message is ""Growing up will be tough, but you will get through it and there are people who will always help you through it."" and that is a VERY important message for children.",e

9,20 September 2015,SquigglyCrunch,6, An Interesting Concept with a Handful of Inconsistencies,"Inside Out is the hit Disney-Pixar animated movie about emotions, specifically emotions living inside a person's brain in a somewhat human form and controlling how people react to things. It's an interesting concept, and for the most part it's presented well, but there are flaws for sure. ",w
10,27 July 2015,PipAndSqueak,1, Misery on a stick,"OK, playtime's over Pixar, now get over it. This film is so plainly a prequel – c.f. references to a 'puberty' button on the new 'emote' console in the character Rileys brain - you will fail to find anything of entertaining value for your 100 minute investment. You may harbour fond memories of Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Ratatouille – all unique, funny, thrilling and entertaining. But, that is not what you will get with Inside Out. 'Joy', after all, is banished to long-term memory and can't get back in charge of the console. (Since when was a single emotion ever 'in charge' anyway?). Inside Out can be taken as a metaphor for the poor sops who work for the Disney Corporation. Yes, they started out with true optimism about the life journey they had chosen, (with Pixar). Then, all of a sudden they are 'taken over' by a less than friendly peer. To compound this, they are moved from their original 'playpen' to a new post industrial work lot. All is grim. Sadness takes hold and taints everything that is done. Even 'Joy' begins to sob with sadness and grief. Save us from this self-indulgent misery. Not only is it inappropriate as kiddie oriented movie fodder, those of us who are sentient, self-aware adults can do without this additional mock unhappiness. By the way, most human brains have a 'fat controller' who orchestrates proceedings keeping everything on an even keel – even if that is 'sadness' for a while. Riley's brain seems to be lobotomised – even before puberty has hit. Give this film a wide berth, in fact, it might be best if someone scuttles this ship before the pestilence it's carrying spreads.",4

Riley(Kaitlyn Dias)is an 11 year old girl, who is really upset with her mom(Diane Lane)and dad's(Kyle MacLachlan)decision to uproot and move the family to San Francisco. Riley is separated from her friends and is just not so happy with dealing with a new house, school and city. She would rather be back in Minnesota playing hockey.",5
14,29 September 2015,MuviFan73,7, Great ride through emotions!,"Inside out is movie about emotions. Various emotions depicted in the movie are joy, fear, disgust, anger and sadness. The movie is about a girl who grows up to 11 years of age and then faces, what we can say, her first major mental breakdown resulting in a sad core memory formation. This happens because of the reason they move from Minnesota to a new place. The dull phase of her life is gradually overcome as the movie progresses as she learns to handle emotions more nicely.",3
15,25 January 2016,PennyReviews,3, Good enough,"Inside Out is the story of how emotions work in our minds (in a girl's mind to be precise). The emotions, Joy and Sadness, wonder around the girl's mind, aiming to find a way back to the controlling room where they can help her through a big change in her life. The story is interesting, but it gets boring towards the end, as the one twist follows the other. Joy is a control freak, dictating every emotions' move and pretty much dominating the girl's mood. Other than that, and the overjoy-full mood, Inside out is funny and entertaining. The colours are vivid and the action enough to make a good movie. But I guess the whole control room, memories, dreams etc etc are kind of confusing, with all the islands and the maze. So 3 out of 10.",6
16,18 June 2015,RforFilm,10, Inside Out is that emotional journey that has been missing from the movies for years. This is one of the best animated stories of all time!,"Inside Out may be the most cartoony story Pixar has released but it is also the most complex and mature. On the one hand, the majority of it is set within the mind of an eleven year old girl and her imagination, but the movie bears in mind (no pun intended) that the human brain is a complex organ that operates on many levels and circuits. The subconscious, abstract thought, memory and emotion all had to be given a physical form for Inside Out. Like a lot of people, I trust Pixar, yet didn't think that they had the talent to pull off something as unique, but crazy as the idea intended. ",5

I love animations, and the artwork for this one is top notch. Pixar has been terrific at delivering great stories until this one. I even love CARS, which many others found fault with. I wasn't in a bad mood when watching this one. I had great expectations. It's simply sucks. It's made a lot of money and has over an 8 rating, so I'm in the minority here.

Wow - it took forever. Bing Bong is the films JAR JAR BINKS, just so annoying and irritating. This is a definite G rated film. I did not see any adult themes whatsoever. This movie makes Winnie The Pooh look like a horror film. This is for 12 year old girls. Parents are so delusional(thanks for the positive reviews Mom & Dad)",_

24,23 June 2015,ironhorse_iv,9, This was mind blowing! This movie was a feel good movie.,"Don't be close-minded. Open your mind to new things, like this movie. It's worth-checking out. Directed by Peter Docter, the movie tells the story of a group of emotions in a little girl's head, trying to deal with a tough, life-changing event. While, the emotions; Joy (Voiced by Amy Poehler), Sadness (Voiced by Phyllis Smith), Anger (Voiced by Lewis Black), Fear (Voiced by Bill Hader), and Disgust (Voiced by Mindy Kaling), want to make the best, out of it; things start to unravel for Riley Anderson (Voiced by Kaitlyn Dias), as her emotions find, that growing up is more difficult, than it seems. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, that this movie is more than a feeling. It's well-crafted animation. Still, there are things in the film that I can nitpick about. While, this isn't really a bad thing, I believe the movie might be a little too sophistication for certain younger audiences. I like how the movie is challenging kids to understand, their own brains, but the movie kinda leaves, some kids confused. Maybe, it need a bit more explanation about what's going on, since there are so much references to Trait theory, abstract thought, Cognitive neuroscience, and the subconscious that kids haven't yet, understood. The humor kinda blends, the same way. You have to be very observed to get some of the jokes here. Jokes like how opinions and facts often get mixed up on the train of thought, might fly pass you, if you're not paying attention. It's very smart, clever, and sublime. Not only is the movie full of mindful jokes, but the movie is the brim with throwbacks to Pixar's previous films, some of them obvious, some of them so hidden in the background that a deeper perceived might be needed. I like all the oddball sequences that the film had to offer. Places like Dream Production, Imaginationland, and Subconscious were pretty cool to see. The world in which, the character live in, is so unique. What a beautiful mind. I love it! I love, every character in this film. The voice acting is amazing. Each one of them, gave a lot of depth to their character. The story is very heart-felt. There are a lot of tear-jerking moments. So, make sure, to bring some tissues! ""Take her to the moon for me, okay?""- I was really crying when that moment came. While, the movie is PG, there are a few scary moments that might be a little too scary for small children. Watch out for Mr. Jangles! I love, how the movie deals with a lot of complex things, such as intertwined relationship in parenthood, camaraderie and friendship. Other things that the movie dealt with, is the heartbreaking realization, that the transience of time will inevitable, lead to more complicated feelings, that parents need to be aware, of. One of the most potent about the movie is learning to accept the undeniable encroachment of Sadness into your life. While, it's good to keep a relentless optimism mind. It's not a bad thing, to feel sad or depress when you need it. Empathy is very important and poignant emotion to have. That's heavy! Neuroscientists were consulted to help make the film's settling of an eleven year girl's brain, very believable and I believe, it's very close to how a young mind, might work. Director Peter Docter got the idea for the project, from his daughter. He always wonder, what was going through her mind. So, he created this movie, using it as an allusion/representation of him as a father watching his own daughter go through emotions like those; that Riley had to deal with. While, a lot of critics, are saying, this movie is very original. I have to say, not really. After all, Peter Docter pretty much copy the concept from his previous work on Cranium Command, the Walt Disney Epcot attraction about the human body and watching earlier Disney short films, like 1943's Reason and Emotion. While the movie isn't that original. The movie moves in a very logically pace. Still, there were a lot of head-scratching moments that made me wonder: What were, they thinking? One of them, is how Sadness and Joy couldn't find their way, back to the Headquarters. There were many good examples of ways, Sadness and Joy could make their trip to HQ, a lot easier, such as using Bing Bong's wagon or recall. Both were establish, way early on in the film, but barely use, until late into the film. Honestly, it would have work, better than the odd Deus Ex Machina trampoline that they found. Another thing that people asking questions is how other people in the film usually have all of their emotions match their gender, but not Riley's. There is a possible explanation to this. While, Riley is a girl with a unisex name. She's a tom-boy, so it wouldn't be, too surprising that she would have two male emotions. I really doubt, she is a transgender, but who knows. I think her mind is bit young, so she still possibly figuring her emotions and identify out. With time, maybe, she also will have emotions adequate to her own basic template. Another thing is while, there is a huge variety of emotions, I think the emotions, they picked, work the best. While the movie is full of familiar Pixar tropes and clichés. I'm glad, that Pixer is back, where they belong. It's was very worrisome, for a while. I really didn't like those lackluster, strategic sequels that they kinda put out, a few years ago. Overall: I really love this movie. I haven't met one person that hate this film, yet. You really have to out of mind, if you hate it, because the movie delivers in every way! So don't live with Anhedonia! Go see this movie! It's worth watching! It's mind-treat!",t
25,12 September 2015,Westeire,1, Torture for parents,"I know there are lots of good reviews. The trailer looked good. Kids wanted to see it. But to be honest found it pretty boring and a waste of money. Where to start, well its an American movie. Just watch the trailer, there isn't much more to it than the trailer, intact its best parts are in the trailer. It goes round in circles. Honestly for movies like this there should be a warning for parents that it may cause severe boredom. Anyway as cartoons go I suppose its fine.lacks laugh out loud humor and its lazy animation is disheartening. Pixar films are known to pack an emotional punch and this doesn't have any of that. All it has to offer is a misguided heart that is visually displeasing.",t

29,25 June 2015,papacorn,1, To find the sun again,"I'm like various reviewers who consider themselves Pixar fans. In fact, I'm an animated film fan and try to see the award winners whenever I can. The beautiful colors and well developed art of Pixar is most often worth the cost of admission to me. But Inside Out is so awful it drove me and my significant other from the theater. The concept is much too heavy and involved to hold the attention of a child. Quickly obvious that this will not be a bit lighthearted and plummets into bleakness. Inside Out becomes doggedly repetitive, with the emotional balls in the air, flailing here and there. The characters in Pixar, have a noticeable sameness of facial features and gestures. ""Joy"" is reminiscent of other females from past movies. This time, the female lead is so over-the-top that, after a short while, I wanted to shout ""shut up and go away!"" I went to be entertained and have a laugh or two. I came away feeling that I'd been emotionally beaten up yet bored to tears.

34,23 February 2019,havenferrer,10, Everyone that rated this below a 7 are why can't have nice things.,"Oh my god. This has to be the most misunderstood Pixar film ever created.
I never realized how much hate this movie had gotten until now, but, reading through the reviews, it just isn't justified.
All of these are parents complaining about it being too intense for young children, but, this film isn't for them. I found that it reached out to a completely new audience, one that Pixar hasn't really touched upon recently, and that is pre-teens and teenagers that suffer from depression.
I am now 14 years old, and this film came out at just the right time for me, when things were taking a turn for the worst. I was going through depression and suicidal thoughts for reasons that I don't want to talk about, around the time in which this film was released. I hadn't seen a disney film in quite a long time, and my little sister really wanted to see this one.
Looking at all the generally positive feedback, I decided to go see it with her.
The opening sequence was possibly one of the best Pixar had done since Wall-E. It was beautiful and cinematic, and just adorable. Riley had some pretty gorgeous facial expressions and detailing for an animation standpoint.
As the film moved on, I started to realize how well this film related to my life, and how well riley related to me as a character. Pixar was very subtle with it, but, managed to develop Riley's character so well, with her barely being on screen.
The characters themselves were shockingly complex, especially sadness and joy. (Joy has a brilliant character design, with blue eyes and blue hair which we'll get to later.)
The main plot basically revolves around a pre-teen going into a state of depression after moving to her new home, away from her friends, her hockey team.
Depression, in my experience, isnt what it says it is. To me, it is a complete lack of any feeling whatsoever. When joy and sadness basically lose control of riley for awhile, this perfectly captured the ""what is going on inside their head"" meaning at the beginning of the film. Joy and sadness are the two most important emotions, and riley didnt have them anymore. A complete lack of emotion, a state of depression.
The rest of the film after that was enjoyable, and a certain character whom I was almost sure going to be a twist villain after that monstrosity that was 'Frozen', turned out to be my personal favorite character in the film. Everyone's had some sort of imaginative personality growing up. I had one.
It helped me cope with stress, I talked to it when I was mad about something, and whenever no one seemed to want to talk to me for whatever the reason, she was always there. That's why Bing Bong's death was just so hard to watch, because of how painfully true it is. I guarantee that 99% of the people on earth have completely forgotten about their imaginative friends growing up. The thing is, he didnt die, he was completely forgotten. When you think about it, it seems so much worse than dying. After that, joy seems to have forgotten about him as well. He isnt mentioned ever again in the movie, but, I'm kinda okay with that. If the movie forgets about him, the audience does as well, which creates an illusion.
Now, let's talk about the ending.
When riley returns home to her worried parents, she seems emotionless. Then I realized something, a slow realization that happened throughout the final scene in the film.
True happiness cannot exist without sadness.
This realization is depicted in one of the most brilliant forms ever, mixed emotions. As riley is growing up and maturing, mixed emotions become apart of her and her core memories. This symbolizes maturity and complexity as you grow up.
This film got me to open up to my parents about my depression and anxiety, and I feel like I have matured just like riley did in the film. Pixar did a brilliant job as depicting our emotions, personalities, and maturity. I love this film so much, and it changed my life.",

It seems to play a lot on getting down in this world and reacting with anger and fear. Joy tries to rescue the mind but is being manipulated by outside forces trying to be goofy but lost in deception. I am not sure what this film is trying to suggest. I recall as a kid I use to have two characters in my head, little aliens, one good and one bad. They would do battle but good would win out each time. Yet, the little manipulative one would sometimes disguise himself as good. Yet, wisdom would come into play and I would send both aliens out of my head. Is Disney being operated by a cult?

Five basic emotions, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust, live inside the mind of Riley and are in control of her attitude and memories. Joy (Amy Poehler) has done a good job of leading the emotions up to this point, but when Riley's parents drag her to San Francisco for her father's job, Sadness (Phyllis Smith) becomes more powerful, much to Joy's chagrin. The metaphors Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen have created in this girl's mind are insanely clever. Very quickly you get a bit ahead of the film, understanding Riley's emotional responses and the inner workings of her mind before we see her, in real life, react. It actually gets so abstract at times I think I wouldn't recommend the film for younger children - it probably is meant more for children closer to Riley's age, and their parents (and adults in general) will probably get more out of it than any child will. There's a bit of a slapstick element, and, honestly, sometimes it feels a bit out of place. As one might expect, the animation is wonderful. The fantastical world is beautiful, but for me it was the characters who really stood out. Joy in particular is one of Pixar's all-time greatest characters, and she's perfectly performed by Poehler. This is definitely one of Pixar's best movies.",

But the concept is just not suited to a longer narrative film-especially one that is intended to be a bittersweet comedy. The emotion-people are driving around us people-people is a funny, striking concept. The film flashes brilliance repeatedly by using this concept logically. Lewis Black as Anger is some of the best casting of all time. But alas the film doesn't work. I believe the following three conceptual problems are what do the film in.",

Joy is the lead protagonist, but she learns plenty about the value of Sadness. Meanwhile, Inside Out depicts abstract concepts like memories, imagination, and the subconscious as literal objects and locations. This is both uniquely fun and substantially informative. Also, the voice acting clearly portrays each emotional state. Undoubtedly, Inside Out will captivate with its plot and linger with its messages.",

If you know the basics of Psychology, then this film is better understandable. Joy was a really fun character, Anger and Fear were easily the most comedic, and Riley was very sweet as well.

Inside out is for those who like quality cinema, to be entertained as well as taught challenging concepts. It is an artistic film. Why do you people always have to assume that all animated films have to be for kids and filled with stupid toilet humour? This is Pixar we are talking about, those who have created Wall-E and Up. Review this movie on its own merits, rather than be biased in your judgement that the film was too dark and confusing for kids. It was never marketed as a film for toddlers and little kids.

This is a very different film to one I've seen from Disney/Pixar tackling a very adult theme in human emotions. It's clever in the way it portrays the emotions and takes us into the world of the subject's mind. What loses it for me is that the film seems lost between playing out as a psychiatric experiment and being a film to entertain little children. The moral of the story seems lost amongst the confusing adventure within the subject's brain.

This should not be news to anyone who has seen a Pixar movie before. And anyone who thinks that that's a bad thing in this case are the ones who the moral of this movie is aimed at. The other complaint that people are having is that they heard it's an original story, when in fact the 'voices in your head' idea has been done before. Yeah, the basic concept has been shown, but so has every concept. And it's not the concept that people are talking about being original; it's the moral. It was absolutely brilliant how they went about explaining a complex moral in a way that children can understand yet doesn't feel overly preachy either. It is a difficult balance to strike, and no matter how well you do it, someone will always dislike it. It shouldn't make me as angry as it does that so many people are misunderstanding this movie.

75,8 July 2015,vincentbethany,1, The Cheese Stands Alone,"I simply cannot comprehend why this movie is being heralded as Pixar's finest. It is flawed in so many ways, which is uncharacteristic of Pixar. The concept is wholly unoriginal, which lead me to believe that Pixar would present us with something astounding to compensate, but what they have given us is unimaginative human characters whose personified emotions represent exhausted stereotypes. When we meet the father's emotions, they're lazily watching sports instead of taking an active interest in family dinner time, while the mother's emotions try to resign themselves to the fact that they have settled for a schlub instead of a handsome ex lover. The daughter is presented as the perfect all-American girl and we are never given even a glimpse of her being anything but perfect until the emotions Joy and Sadness find themselves ejected from the control center of her mind. Then suddenly she's the clichéd brat that lazy story telling will have us believe of every tween and teenager. The most unbelievable action of this character comes when this seemingly ideal daughter decides that in order to be happy she should run away from her loving home and travel alone across the country. All the while, mom and dad take this in their stride as though she's always behaved this way. All this, we are shown, is because the only emotions running the show are anger, disgust and fear, since joy and sadness are still trying to return to the control center. By Pixar's logic, we are incapable of rational actions without joy and sadness. Okay, I get that it's a movie, but this is bad writing. At one point we are expected to accept Sadness's antics simply because she claims that she doesn't know why she's doing what she's doing. What!?! If the ones controlling the brain cannot account for their actions, then what is the point of the premise? Perhaps the sequel will show us the emotions inside the heads of the emotions sadness, joy and the rest. Aside from the terrible story line and lack of character depth, the film lacks the usual humor we have come to associate with Pixar, and while Joy and Sadness's quest to get back where they belong is undoubtedly frustrating for them, the constant obstacles they encounter make it almost unbearable to sit through. Mostly, I feel, because again and again they keep getting sooooo close, only to have something happen and they have to find another way, finally making it happen through the use of a stack of imaginary boyfriends. Let me say that again: They finally get back to control by stacking up a bunch of imaginary boyfriends. Yes, I know, it's a movie, and a cartoon at that, but this is Pixar. We have come to expect better. Well, I have, at least. Judging by the other reviews and the box office, Inside Out is a huge hit. I still cannot fathom why. I must be taking crazy pills.",

Tears, creativity, uniquely presented emotions. This always shades the stuff I feel personally. While it didn't speak to me as much as others, I have to admit that it was enjoyable and highly creative. We have as our protagonist, Riley, a little girl who has been fawned on her whole life. She is happy like all kids with a few bumps along the way, as well as typical behavior. We find out that she has been formed by a set of emotions who take on an anthropomorphic being. The five of them create her personality. Unfortunately for her, the family moves from its idyllic setting in Minnesota to San Francisco, where everything is indeed different. During this time, the five emotions become unsettled and this becomes a kind of adventure tale. Joy and Sadness get shot out of their control center, and while they are finding their ways back, Riley begins to fall apart. The strength of this animated film has to do with all aspects of consciousness, such the area of creativity and art where the characters are turned into Picasso figures and later two dimensional figures. There is also the ""Train"" of consciousness, as well as some Freudian stuff to work with. Memories are save on little orbs and are at the center of putting a person back together again. An imaginary friend is brought in as well. This is quite adult at times, showing things that the kids just won't get. Well worth the time to see it. Oh, I know it's been said before. Stop giving movies ones unless they are deserving. Your job is to review, not to vilify things that aren't perfect.

The concept was executed so well, all the aspects of the mind, how dreams are made, everything was so creative and never seen before. The voice actors are perfectly cast! Phyllis smith cast as sadness was spot on! And of course Amy pohler stole the spotlight as Joy. The movie at times was also very moving and heart felt, I found myself close to tears at one point. I thought Pixar really out did themselves! This is my favorite Pixar film of all time! I found myself having belly laughs through the whole thing, along with tears at other parts. Disgust and anger and fear were also very well made, and featured very funny moments as they try to function when joy and sadness are missing. This movie really just leaves you more than satisfied.

110,30 June 2015,anaconda-40658,10, Awesome Inside and Out!,"Inside Out (2015): Dir: Pete Docter, Ronaldo Del Carmen / Voices: Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling: Another Pixar masterpiece and with a theme regarding emotions. Riley is a teenage girl struggling with the recent move of her family. Her passion is hockey but her hopes are in the dumps. Inside, her emotions attempt to maintain her sense of being. There is Joy, voiced with good cheer by Amy Poehler, and she tries to maintain the positive. Phyllis Smith voices Sadness whose touch can upset the balance. Bill Hader voices Fear, Mindy Kaling voices Disgust, and Lewis Black steals moments as the tempered voice of Anger. Central plot regards the misplacement of several memories and Joy and Sadness stranded outside headquarters struggling to get back. As Riley falls deeper into a depression, the islands of her brain slowly self destruct. These island include Family, Friendship, Passions, etc. Along the way they encounter Riley's forgotten imaginary friend, Bing Bong who is made up of various animals including elephant, dolphin, cat, etc. He cheerfully helps the duo get to the Train Of Thought but many obstacles prevent them. This is a colourful and creative family adventure that addresses the very core of our being and how we respond to things. Tension constantly builds as Joy and Sadness, and eventually Bing Bong are road blocked constantly by despair before true heroics set in and emotional balance is set. This is another winner by Pixar and it scores on all levels of emotion but mostly joy. That is how viewers will likely react upon seeing it. Score: 10 / 10",

We have babies and some sappy family moments and some weird explanations that nobody can understand. But then they move from Minnesota to San Francisco. Ok, I'm from Minnesota, MINNESOTA IS SO NICE! WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO LEAVE! (That's probably why they had us watch it) Then the girl starts having a mental breakdown and Happy and Sad are sucked out of a tube.... and it just gets weirder from there..... they end up in a tunnel and have to make their way back to to the tower. So Happy and Sad walk and find this stupid elephant guy who claims to be able to guide them through the maze but just gets them stuck in some wierd chamber where the animation styles start changing. (I'll stick with Spider-Verse for clashing animation) Then there is this boring side plot with the girl and Angry, Disgusting, and Fear. Then there is some more weird stuff in between and then the 11 YEAR OLD girl decides to use a CREDIT CARD to go back to Minnesota! What? How does that work? I dunno but then the end happens and I have no idea what happened because I didn't understand it. I just don't understand what's happened to Pixar, they used to be so good.

It seems as though Pixar tried desperately to make a movie with an adult theme (ie the psychological workings of emotions in the mind, with a plot that is, unfortunately, commonplace in real life ) but with goofy animation that appeals to children.. I wish they stuck to the adult humor that goes over the kid's heads rather than serious issues that goes over the kid's heads.. Sadly in the end, the ""happy"" ending was only mildly happy. Not nearly happy enough to raise me up out of the depression the movie had sank me into.. I left the cinema down, and that's not what I like to spend money on. I asked my daughter, ""so what would you give it out of 10?""

He was certainly right about that! This film-which centered on the emotions of a girl who feels alienated moving to a new place after years of being comfortable in the old one-can be funny and sad in all the right places. Especially when it focuses on the characters of Joy and Sadness and also an imaginary friend, this movie hits all the right buttons. Very young children may not completely understand all that's depicted but they should still be pretty entertained by many of the images and characterizations depicted here in computer animated form.

As some people might say it is too heavy for kids, I beg the question how do you know your kid isn't feeling this way currently?

Well here's your answer, Inside Out portrays the game your emotions play in a way no movie has ever done before, to an extent no movie will ever go hereafter. An emotional ride, a literal emotional ride which is as joy as it is sad to watch, which will show what anger and disgust feel like while carefully portraying fear, all in the mind of Riley, our protagonist or so we think because that's what the movie is trying to do, to make us think and think we will for there isn't another animated film more engaging in the genre of drama. Why do you sometimes feel lost? Why can't you sometimes anything? How are your feelings lost? The film answers all such questions with an extremely controlled grasp on the imagination of it's creators. The execution of the film being near perfect it only makes the story look more magnificent than it already is. Pete Doctor and Pixar deliver again an animated movie which the world of cinema lovers will cherish for years to come. A genuine story so original that every second of it has something new to offer to the audience. The actors and actresses who though only use their voices portray the individual emotions to a stellar extent. Sadness being the best of all emotions both acting-vise and character-vise stands out with joy giving tough competition to sadness again both acting-vice and character-vice. The background score though not very impressive but engaging through out the second act but that's not what you will be busy listening, you will be busy praising the highly imaginative story . To sum up in one line. It is one of very few original films out there which no Film lover should miss.",

We were instantly intrigued with the characters in Riley's head as they entertainingly worked together as Riley's emotions. Then, Joy and Sadness got lost from headquarters and the movie began on it's downward plummet...towards a stressful, unorganized, Hodge-Podge of frustration! They encountered obstacle after obstacle until we were so ready for this movie to be over. It seemed to be annoying for adults and confusing for children. The movie just didn't work, there were not even close the amount of emotions necessary to compare to the complexity of the human mind, and the story of Riley wanting to take a bus back to Minnesota by herself thinking it would make her happy was ridiculous.

In its most audacious attempt at that and in the extraordinary league of 'Up' and 'Wall-E', Pixar now gets behind the scenes of adolescence in the most imaginative way possible with Inside Out. Directors Peter Docter ('Up', 'Monsters, Inc') and Ronnie Del Carmen create a wonderfully animated world of the complex human mind with stunning details of notions such as islands of personality, dream studios, imagination land and the headquarters.

182,2 December 2015,leonblackwood,5, Brilliant animation with an average storyline! 5/10,"Review: I really liked the concept of this movie because it was fresh and original but I was a bit disappointed with the outcome. Like many Pixar movies, it looked amazing and the attention to detail was great but the storyline dried up after a while and I personally thought that it was a bit confusing for little kids. It's about a young girl called Riley, voiced by Kaitlyn Dias, who moves to San Francisco from Minnesota with her parents and finds it hard to fit in. Whilst going through her transitions, we get to look at her Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness emotions which are going through turmoil after her Joy and Sadness emotions lose some of her core memories. After retrieving the memories, they struggle to get back to there headquarters which means that Riley is stuck with her Fear, Anger and Disgust emotions. When Joy and Sadness manage to get back to there headquarters, Riley is able to lead a normal life in her new house but as she gets older, the headquarters becomes bigger because of her many new emotions, including puberty. Its a clever storyline with some funny moments but I would have liked to see the other emotions a bit more, especially Anger, who made me laugh. The bonus material on the DVD should have been used in the film because it was brilliant. It showed the different emotions of her dad and mother while Riley was going out with a boy, so if you get your hands on the DVD/Blu- ray, you really have to give it a watch. Anyway, there isn't much adult material, like in other Pixar movies but it's fun for the whole family. I did miss the catchy songs and the usual mean villain but there is enough material to keep it interesting. My expectations are always high when it comes to Pixar animation movies so I did feel a bit let down with the outcome. It's not the type of film that I can watch time and time again like Toy Story or the Incredibles but if you want to keep the kids quiet, it's worth a purchase. Average!",

What about if the majority of those were solid 10/10's? At this point, I wouldn't believe if Pixar couldn't make a great film so I had every expectation of Inside Out being a home-run and it is! Is it my favourite Pixar film? No, not by a long shot but there are parts of this movie that are stone-cold brilliant and some things about it that make it less than outstanding as some of Pixar's previous films. Still, Inside Out is brilliant when it comes to concept. And its also brilliant for the reason Pixar films are and that is the sheer detail that goes into these films. They don't make their animated films with the demographic of children in mind but rather the demographic of everyone. These are films that anyone can watch and like at an equal level. Still, some of there movies tend to be a touch dark and deal with some very intense emotions (pun intended.) They don't shy away from real life lessons and the reality of life (death, marriage, love etc) Inside Out is no exception. There are some heavy duty lessons here and some definitive dark moments so be wary if showing to the real youngsters.",
189,23 June 2015,Seraphion,6, Too philosophical or technical for kids,"Somehow I don't really think that this movie is really suitable for parents to bring kids to watch. The basic concept is either too technical or too philosophical altogether. The concepts of humans' five basic emotions is well beyond the grasp of an elementary school kid, let alone a toddler. Even though the movie gets to be more and more reasonable as it goes on, still it won't be such a good experience to share about. The animation is nice, it doesn't have overly weird or disproportional drawing styles or camera angles that will further confuse children audiences. And the voice acting is nicely expressive. That should balance the things that this movie lacks.",

After seeing Inside Out, it appears that the Disneyfication of Pixar is now complete. This movie is just another one of those execrable Disney Tinkerbell movies with better actors and animation. It is so insipid that I wanted to leave within the first two minutes (ok, I actually wanted to leave during the horrible short that preceded it.) There was much laughter in the audience; all of it from children under the age of 6. Pixar movies always entertained people of all ages with their clever plots, excellent acting, and beautiful graphics. The animation of Inside Out was decent, the cast excellent, but I have nothing good to say about the rest. The plot was extremely derivative. There was absolutely no surprise about what was going to happen - once they set up the premise, it was obvious that we were doomed to another hour of their trying to get back, with mishaps along the way and the inevitable happy ending. It reminded me of the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 rock climbing episode (for those of you in the know). Even my teenager and her friend thought the movie and short were ""babyish"". I'm waiting until they make a princess sequel and have a ride named after it at Disneyland. Bye, bye Pixar. I'll miss you.",

Disney needs to remember they are in the ""entertainment"" business. This is the second movie they have made lately that leaves you feeling worse after you saw it than you were before viewing it. Inside Out begins with a good story line, but sadness (better named depression)is the biggest part of the movie. Yes, there is realism. But, I prefer the ""fantasy"" part of cartoons where one can escape the bad and enjoy a light-hearted laugh for a bit. In my opinion, Disney head's need to see a professional about this depression they feel so compelled to share. I won't waste my money on another movie ticket to a Disney show until can see people laughing when they talk about the new show. I grew up with Disney movies and loved almost all of them.

There are 5 states of emotion inside her head, all in different colors: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust. I have to say I was quite wondering for a large part of the film why 4 are negative and only one is positive.

While maintaining a child friendly and beautiful atmosphere, there is a very dark undertone that children may not fully understand but will undoubtedly feel.",

Right off the bat, this film is imaginative and creative. The concept is, of course, original and it isn't a surprise since Pixar has some great story boards. However, what makes this film special is that, even with it's creative concept and premise, if you simmer it down, it really is just a simple and heartfelt story. It's about an 11 year old girl who loses her core memories and Joy and Sadness in the process. Now they have to get back before she does anything stupid or lose herself, but as usual it becomes a fun adventure that still plays with our heart strings. ",

A friend of mine is a psychiatrist, he found it relevant to his 10 year old son and young people in general. He picked up a psychiatric journal that 'does not review movies' but there it was... Inside Out. If there was an 11 this would be a 12. How great was Bing Bong, part cat, cotton candy and dolphin. Lol. This movie brought to life a child's brain - something wonderful and complex. The animation was great, the voices were great but the script was out of this world. Who knew how much fun the visualization of the angst of an 11 year old could be?!? (I mean that in the nicest way.) If you ever tried to picture what goes on in young heads, well, try no more. Inside Out is not for little children, I would say 11/12 and up.

226,14 October 2015,sweetsmile-90907,1," Pixar, how far you have fallen...because this movie was terrible. Really.","There are a few reasons why I consider this movie terrible and why I find it so horrifying that it's current rating is 8.5 when Spirited Away--one of the best animated movies ever created--is sitting at 8.6. Long story short, the characters were for the most part difficult to like. Joy was thoughtlessly cruel and condescending to Sadness and the other emotions, and Riley--the girl we're all supposed to love and find easy to relate to--was extremely obnoxious/egocentric and rubbed me the wrong way for the entire movie. I resented the stereotypes that were used and found them more than a little insulting. For example, Riley has an ""imaginary boyfriend"" at the age of 12. I don't know about you people, but I find this extremely concerning. 12 year old girls should NOT be thinking that they should have boyfriends at their age--while it may start out innocent, it can unconsciously encourage premature sexual thoughts and activity, which is EXTREMELY unhealthy and dangerous at their age. Also, I don't personally know any girls (including myself) who ACTUALLY had imaginary boyfriends. Ever. Let alone at 12! And don't even get me started on the imaginary friend Bing-Bong. BING-BONG! That's actually his name! I found him irritating and, frankly, disturbing. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm sure young children will LOVE this movie, and maybe some parents and teenagers as well. However, on the whole, I would NOT consider it up to par with other Disney Pixar movies. It was compared to ""UP"" for Pete's sake--the movie that had EVERYONE crying within the first 10 minutes! It was an enormous let- down for me, especially since all the raving had really caused me to build it up, which made it all the more disappointing. Therefore, watch at your own peril. Consider yourself warned.",

Writer-Directors Pete Doctor and Ronnie Del Carmen develop this fascinating film by focusing on the mental emotions inside Riley by developing characters of her emotions; which include Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust. Not to sound like a Debbie Downer, but my personal cerebral character of the picture was Sadness; actress Phyllis Smith did a stellar vocal performance as Sadness, which ironically brought me much joy in laughter. Anyways, back to the narrative. When things go wrong inside Riley's brain when Joy is jumped out from Riley's memory headquarters, Riley becomes disillusioned about her new life in San Francisco and finds no joy in it. Joy, alongside Sadness, must find their way back to Riley's Cerebral Headquarters before she loses all emotion.

263,22 June 2015,bonekeep,9, Deserves its place with other Pixar classics...,"It's tempting to name the Oscar winner in Animated Feature Film for this year (2015) already, because Inside Out is going to be tough to beat! From the same writer/director, Pete Docter of Pixar classics such as Toy Story (all of them), Monster's Inc, and Up, Inside Out figured to be another great one and surely delivered. The story is of a girl named Riley who's emotions help guide her from birth to the point at which her life is uprooted by a move away from her home town. Those emotions - joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and anger - are terrifically voiced by the likes of Amy Poehler (SNL), Phyllis Smith (The Office), Bill Hader (SNL), Mindy Kaling (The Office), and Lewis Black (Stand-up comic). The animation is glorious, and I feel like I need to see this movie a half dozen more times to be able to take it all in. Add to that an interesting and convincingly complex story line that conceptualizes memories, dreams, the sub conscience, and such in very clever ways. I think the story itself is too complicated for a younger audience, but like many Pixar films, part of the magic is being able to entertain audiences of all levels, even when the story is geared for a more mature audience (think WALL-E, which Pete Docter also wrote). This film doesn't quite have the emotional impact or laughs of a Monster's, Inc., or Toy Story 3 (my personal favorite), but it surely has its tender moments with plenty of funny stuff. That, along with a lively, clever plot and eye candy galore, makes Inside Out a definite must see.",
264,30 December 2015,Genti25,10, One of the best animated movies of all time.,"Inside Out is the newest Pixar movie and also one of their best ever,which clearly means that this movie is something special. This movie is about Riley,an 11 year old girl from Minnesota who loves Hockey and lives happily with her mom and dad.But everything falls apart when they move to San Francisco,where she has to deal with a new house,and new school where she needs to make new friends and her emotions Joy,Sadness,Fear,Anger and Disgust guide her through these life changing events.Though,affected by these changes,Sadness makes a few mistakes that end up with her and Joy,into the far reaches of Riley's mind and with only Fear,Anger and Disgust left to the head quarters to guide Riley and to try and maintain positive thinking. First off to begin with,the emotions and their voice cast in this movie is all around perfect.Starting with Joy,voiced by Amy Poehler,Fear by Bill Hader,Disgust by Mindy Kaling,Anger by Lewis Black and Sadness by Phyllis Smith.They all do a masterful job in here,giving the right voice ""emotion"" to their emotions. Pete Docter is the director of this movie,he previously directed Monsters Inc,which I truly love,and Up,which is my all time favorite animated movie.This guy is a genius at this.He has mastered the art of the animation so well now that everything he does,its perfect. I really liked the way the world inside the mind was presented.I think they found new and interesting ways to show that to us and to impress us.The animation is gorgeous as every other Pixar movie ever,but what makes this movie great,it is the story,that its special and amazing.It is also very funny and will most certainly brings tears of joy (literally) to those who watch it. Kids should see this movie,because they will have fun and marvel at the animation,and laugh at the jokes in it.They will also learn about emotions and about what makes us human as a whole.But quiet frankly,in my opinion this movie is targeted more to adults,because of its thematic and interesting plot and I am pretty sure that adults will get the best of this movie,which is a weird thing to say about an animation,but then again,this is Pixar and you can except anything from these miracle workers. I honestly cried like 3 times in this movie,which is to be expected from this director,after that truly sad and masterpiece of a movie that he made before this,Up,and from what I heard,a lot of people cried also which is an astonishing achievement for the crew. I read an article on how Psychiatrists around the world are really loving this movie,which can clearly tell you just how amazing and well thought Inside Out is.They are saying that kids should definitely see this movie and that it can teach them a lot about emotions which is a hard thematic discussion to have for adults with their children. This is a stunning and original movie,also by far the best Pixar movie since Toy Story 3,and in my opinion,in Top 3 of all time Pixar movies.Everyone should watch this movie and I hope that it gets nominated for Best Picture,as Pixar's two earlier movies (Up and Toy Story 3).",

It makes you think about everything that could be going on inside the mind of a child when she's going through difficult adjustments in her life, and more generally, what goes on inside all of us. I'm not sure why the film has drawn such ire from some viewers, maybe it's just one of those love/hate movies, or maybe you (or a loved one) have to have gone through a serious struggle to have it resonate. I loved the poignant scenes of leaving childhood memories behind (wow! these were just stunning to me), and how the somewhat unlikely hero turned out to be little Sadness.",

I have never been a big fan of animated features because their just cartoons and if I want that I'll watch the ones that air on television that I like. But their is this amazing company called Pixar(maybe you've heard of them). They've given me some of my favorite films not just as a child but as I've gotten older. I'm talking Monsters University and of course Toy Story 3. I cried like a baby in Toy Story 3. I haven't cried so hard in a film since, until now when I saw Pixar's latest film Inside Out. The film is about a child named Riley and the little voices inside her head. First comes Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear and last but not least Anger. Their Riley's emotions, Joy tries to make sure Riley is happy everyday but Sadness keeps getting in the way. When Riley moves Joy tries to start things out positively in Riley's new home but when Sadness touches another Core memory Joy tries to change it back and they both vanish into long term memory. While they have disappeared Fear, Disgust, and Anger try to make Riley happy on her first day of school and until but they weren't made for those types of feelings. Joy and Sadness have to find a way back to headquarters before Riley runs away from home, her personality destroyed and she can no longer feel anything. I loved the performances from the cast, even the one's who were playing Riley, and her parents. You already know when going into this film that the main stars playing the emotions are going to do an amazing job. Their well known stars in a Pixar movie with a good script. The script isn't very formulaic because it plays with the idea of how we use our emotions. It has a worthwhile point of always doing your best to no mater how feel, you can channel both your sadness with happiness, anger with fear, disgust with happiness or in any way. To makes sure that no matter how we feel we can always be happy no mater what situation, because theirs always way to turn something terrible into something good. While watching the film I was crying because I thought about how I use my emotions in the wrong way when it comes to a girl I like or a girl I like that moves, or not fitting with the people I call my friends at church(because I have nothing in common with them because I love films like it's no one's business, play XBOX One, and I'm going to Fl Supercon, and well I still have acne after trying to get rid of it for five years. This is a film that really touched and can regard as one of the best animated films of all time I'm giving Inside Out a five out of five.",
274,20 June 2015,subxerogravity,9, Nothing but the best from Pixar.,"There is some well done animation going here that's going to make inside out an instant classic among classics like Finding Nemo and The Incredibles. It was so well crafted this time around, the movement of the 3D images were better than anything I've seen before. It's very colorful (like a child's mind), and the animation give off a scene of action adventure in the movement, very exciting to watch. ",
275,14 July 2015,michaelhirakida,8, A Cast Of Colorful Three Dimensional Characters and Brilliant Storytelling.,"Inside Out is basically about depression. The main character Riley moves from Minnesota to San Francisco and starts having mood swings inside her head after Joy and Sadness somehow get into long term memory where Anger, Fear and Disgust must find a way to make Riley happy again.",
276,6 July 2015,IanAJohnson,8, This film was funny and had a refreshing lesson to tell.,"Inside Out is the story of a little girl named Riley and the little voices inside her head that control her emotions. After Riley's family moves to a new home, the emotions in her head (Joy, Anger, Disgust, Fear and Sadness) begin to experience some technical difficulties and question the purpose of Sadness. While trying to keep Riley in check, Joy and Sadness get separated from the group and have to try and get back to headquarters before Riley has an emotional breakdown. While I have found the last few of Pixar's films have strayed from their audience (either focusing too much on the children or the adults), this one is a return to form. While there are more then enough jokes meant for children and there are just as many meant for adults. I laughed quite often. The art style is perfect for the concept and the casting was perfect. There is a lot to like, but my favorite aspect of this film is the moral lesson that this film teaches. Not only is the lesson incredibly useful to not only children and adults, but it is truly helpful and a lesson that not a lot of people focus on. There are not many flaws with the film. Most of my complaints are nitpicking at best. The biggest one I have is with the structure of the plot and not the plot itself. It suffers from what I call Armageddon Syndrome (named after the first film that I noticed having this particular issue). A good plot is supposed to slowly increase tension and progress through a series of important moments until it reaches a climax where it them calms down and resolves. Armageddon Syndrome is where there seems to be little to no progress until the final climax. The plot in Inside Out just looped itself for a majority of the film until it felt like finishing. This made the movie get a little boring at times. Joy and Sadness would try some method to get back by going to locations that signify different parts of the human psyche, would fail, and try again until no more jokes and puns could be made. While this is a major, glaring issue with the film, it doesn't detract all that much since the writing is so good. The best way to think of this film is like a road trip across the country. The destinations are fun and memorable, but the drive between them is kind of boring and repetitive. Despite this I highly recommend watching Inside Out.",
277,22 June 2015,omorg-pub,10," not as entertaining as some Pixar films, but brilliant all the same","okay, this is why i loved this movie. it is a BRILLIANT integration of jungian and themes from Joseph campbell in the best tradition of fable telling. There are those (i am one) who believe that fables are metaphorical constructs intended to help/teach children how to deal with difficult emotional realities such as abusive parents, social terrors, and the like. This is an EMOTIONALLY intelligent film perfect for many audiences. Quite honestly, it came along at a great point in my life (and i am a 50yo woman). It reminded me that without Sadness, there can be no Joy. But it goes far deeper than that. It interprets jungian ideas about the sub/unconscious, about repression, about personality, about letting go, about growth, about complexes, shadow work, and gets into memory theory, dream research... so much more... if you are a real student of the psyche, you will see what i mean. and it boils it all down into a useful, affective metaphor. Unlike another reviewer, i did not find it triggered PTSD or depression or anything else. It has helped me accept that i have a lot of buried sadness that I've tried very hard to repress, and that that sadness has a real and valuable role to play in my life, and it may help me move forward in that respect. I don't know if that counts as a spoiler, but i tagged this review just in case.",
278,12 April 2017,moonspinner55,5, Disney-Pixar comedy about emotions seems to operate more on mania than anything else,"Computer-animated family film from Pixar Animation Studios and released by Disney, about the emotional scramble going on inside the brain of a normal, healthy little girl, is extraordinarily bright and colorful--and yet hyperactive, with overlapping dialogue that rushes by at such a fast clip one might think the sound designers and everyone else involved with the film were feeling the effects of a sugar rush. There's not much to the narrative (trouble-causing Sadness and ringleader Joy have to find their way out of the kid's long-term memory storage), while most of the attention is focused on the child's five basic emotions (the girl, Riley, and her parents rarely come to the fore as actual characters). Kids seem to enjoy the film because it's fluorescent and energetic, like a cereal commercial on television. With so much slapstick and shouting, it could easily compete with a restless child's attention span--and win. ** from ****",

282,16 August 2015,ultramatt2000-1,10," Smart, heart-warming and super funny.","I saw this movie and I was impressed! Back by popular demand, it's ""Matthew Praises!"" It is not just the run of the mill family movie with CGI and celebrity talents, this one is psychologically well-researched! It is a mixture between Dinsey's World War 2 propaganda short ""Reason and Emotion"" mixed with Roger Hargreaves' ""Mr. Men"". The reason why I said that is because all the emotions are controlling the girl's head just like in that cartoon. Second, I said the latter part of the comparison because like Roger Hargreaves, the were thinking, ""What would a personification of an emotion would look like?"" What would a memory bank be depicted and how would the subconscious or dreams look like? The skin of the emotions look like felt, kind of like The Muppets, except they sparkle like some sort of fire. The film gave out a good side-effect which was controlling your emotions. A father took his kid to see the movie and after watching it, he took his son to the pool and he climbed up highest diving board and dived into the pool and his father asked why he did that out of curiosity and he said that fear was driving the bus. Before the feature, there was an introduction by Pete Docter, the film's director, talking about the joy of going to the movies and the short, ""Lava"" about two volcanoes in love. Bottom line: You will laugh, you will cry and you will understand why! So come on and give it a watch it is fun for the whole family. There is no shocking moments like the ones seen on Cartoon Network today. I am positive that you will enjoy it. Bottom line: A must-watch. Rated PG for thematic elements (like references to profanity) and some action (more like some peril, but seriously MPAA raters you are just over-reacting, it should be rated G). This has been another ""Matthew Praises.""",

This contains a lot of the knowledge that practising psychologists use in their counselling and therapeutic practices.

284,3 August 2015,KineticSeoul,10, My favorite movie of 2015,"This is a family animated movie that the whole family can thoroughly enjoy. I personally think adults will enjoy this movie more than the kids though. While movies like ""Minions"" is something kids might have more fun with. Well most kids anyway...Just my opinion. I never saw the trailer to this movie before watching this movie and when I saw posters for this film. I didn't put much thought about it and thought it would be another generic kids movie. I was totally wrong, this is probably my favorite movie of 2015. It really is a brilliant animated movie that moves the inner emotions. As a matter of fact that is what this movie is about, emotions. Like how it would be like if each emotions like Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear had their own characteristics. Even if the two main emotions in this movie is Joy and Sadness. Because they are the ones on the journey back the the headquarters, while the other emotions tries to keep things under control. Each emotions interactions and how they work together mainly in the control room of the mind of a little girl named Riley was very creatively executed. And how they each has a role like a job in the human mind was wacky and yet fun. So yeah, it has a awesome premise and direction going for it. This movie had potential and took it to another level. The reason I think a lot of adult would really enjoy this movie, is because of the nostalgic and empathetic factors because of life experiences. Watching this movie was like a really good Dr. Seuss story come to life. It came from the creative minds of Pete Docter and Ronnie del Carmen. I felt like I was part of this movie and felt what the protagonist Riley was going through. This truly is a heartfelt movie with a lot of heart to it and it's also whimsical at the same time. I thought it was highly imaginative how they also incorporated imagination, conscious, unconscious, subconscious, memories and dreams. To put it simply, this is a film I really needed to watch. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that has emotions.",

291,3 July 2015,alicjaljohnson,9, Instant Pixar Classic!,"One of the many mysteries of life is emotion, and the presence of a conscience in people. Inside Out is a much more fascinating exploration of these two abstract concepts than my Psychology 100 class was. Kaitlyn Dias voices Riley, an eleven-year-old girl who has just moved from Minnesota to San Francisco, much to her dismay. But the real stars of the show are her emotions: Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kahling), and Anger (Lewis Black). These emotions live in Riley's headquarters, where Riley's core memories are kept — memories (notably all happy ones) that create Riley's ""islands"" of personalities. These islands and these core memories are the essence of Riley; they define her. The emotions, with the bubbly Joy being in the lead, are responsible for Riley's mental activity and the choices she makes. They also are responsible for processing memories, each memory having a definitive emotion attached to it. Before Riley's family moves, Joy and the other emotions are proud of the fact that they've kept practically every memory happy. The only emotion bothered by this is Sadness, who begins touching memories and Riley's thoughts, permanently turning them sadand ruining everything, according to Joy. In an effort to keep Sadness from making a core memory into a blue experience, Joy and Sadness fall out of headquarters. Now, the two adverse emotions must make their way back to the headquarters with the help of Bing Bong (Richard Kind), the imaginary friend from Riley's younger days. Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen (co-directors) invent a very unique story, one that appeals to children and adults. Kids are often mystified by what goes on in the minds of others, as are adults (despite whatever extensive knowledge we may have of cerebral activity). Docter and Del Carmen walk us through how traumatic events, such as moving to a strange place, can affect our emotions. In a particular scene from the film, Sadness is inexplicably drawn towards touching a memory and turning it sad. She can't help this urge; just as people are helpless against feeling down sometimes. The film really does show how negative feelings are uncontrollable and inevitable, a concept that may be hard to grasp for younger viewers.",

But BAM, it turned out to be a big let down! It just doesn't live up to the hype. It's an 'okay' type movie. And, how'd it get 8+ on IMDb, I'll never know. I guess there's a bias towards Disney movies. It stands somewhere near '6' or something. Little kids may enjoy it but only if they get the concept. Those who'll get the concept, won't enjoy it. So, overall, you can skip this one. Or, watch it at home at the most. I'd rather watch an old Japanese animation than this one. There are so many good movies by studio ghibli that never get old and boring even if you watch them again and again. And, I heard they have recently put out what is possibly their last movie ""When Marnie Was There"". I haven't watched that yet. So, now is probably the time!",

After watching it, I would have to agree. The animation was great(as usual for Disney movies) and the storytelling was clear and easy to understand. But to me, the thing that would make or break this film is the comedy in it. And in my opinion, it was extremely funny. The characters(emotions) in the film are funny and memorable. One of my favorite characters is Riley's imaginary friend, Bing Bong(my favorite emotion is the hilarious Anger.) There are also certainly some touching moments in the movie but it is balanced with the comedy so as not to be too sappy. For me the only problem with the film is it's scope(the whole movie takes place in San Francisco except the very beginning) and lack of adventure (outside of the mind), but it makes up for it with creativity, comedy, and great storytelling and characters.

304,11 July 2015,cultfilmfan,10, Inside Out,"For me, modern day animated films can be a tough sell. I love animation and have since I was a child. I grew up watching a lot of the Walt Disney cartoons that kids today still watch and love. As, I grew older I got interested in more adult oriented animated films such as the work of Ralph Bakshi, Bill Plympton and films such as Gerald Potterton's Heavy Metal. I also found as I grew up that I was not really all that interested in 3D animation which really seemed to be taking off. To me it looked like you were staring at a computer program, or game and I felt it lacked emotion and a lot of the story relied on the new age type of effects and techniques the animators could now use with these computer programs and techniques. I also found the writing of the films got lazier and it just overall did not win me over at all. There were some good exceptions within the last 15 years, or so of some really good animated films such as Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away as well as Sylvain Chomet's The Triplets of Belleville. Such beautifully animated and extremely creative and well written animated films like these were unfortunately becoming a rarity. A lot of the stuff Disney and it's collaboration with Pixar, was unfortunately not working for me all that much either as I found that they often had a hard time of balancing whether to make a film that worked for both adults and kids and I sometimes found that as above mentioned, that I had problems with the 3D animation and the writing relied too heavily on this new technology and effects. There were a few exceptions, but to me something like the Shrek films (I know these are Dreamworks films and not Pixar) and films of that kind which were heavily praised and adored, were to me extremely overrated. Thankfully now with Inside Out, we are getting back to a type of animated film that has animation I like as well as a great story, creativity and will definitely work for both the adult and child audiences going to see the film. This film takes a premise of something that I think we can all relate to and makes a fascinating and very creative movie out of it, that also turns out to be a lot of fun. This one however, particular interested me. The whole human brain and dealing with emotions and the human psychosis has fascinated me ever since I was a child. At a time in my life, I felt like I wanted to be a therapist, or a counselor one day and human problems, emotions and various neurosis of different people fascinated and compelled me. Through the 90's I remember being a huge fan of the animated series, Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist and found the show very humorous as well as also really enjoying the dialogue between Katz and his patients and what was meant to be humorous and was, was also fascinating to me with what makes one think, or feel, or act this way. Inside Out, takes this to a whole new level by giving five of every human's basic chemistry and emotions into fully animated and into talking characters. We have Joy (each character is named after their emotion), Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger. The actors who do the voice over work do a terrific job and the writers have given each a wonderfully true and yet fun and playful personality and each depicting the certain feeling that they are meant to represent. Joy (who is one of the main characters of the film) is so bubbly and just an absolute joy to watch that you get enjoyment and just feel happiness just radiating from her that she is literally a joy to watch. All the other characters each have their own priceless moments and really add to the film as well. The human characters in this story each depict average everyday people and the different emotions we go through on an everyday basis making the film easy for a viewer of any age to relate and connect to. The film is creative in both it's writing, voice over work and animation. The film takes us through many adventures and many brilliantly conceived ideas and plot devices, but also hits home once in awhile and makes us think of our own body chemistry and our own emotions at times. This is the most creative and flat our brilliant I have seen in a mainstream animated film in a long time. Inside Out works for both adults and kids and is fun, visually pleasing and has everything that should set off the perfect modern day animated film. Disney and Pixar's best in awhile.",

So when I heard that the first reviews of Inside Out were very positive, I got really excited knowing that Pixar has finally made another great film! I was especially excited by this news because I think it's been quite a while since Pixar's last really good film, like I think the last Pixar film that I was really enthusiastic about was Toy Story 3. After that movie it's been a bit rough for the company; Cars 2 was a completely unnecessary sequel, Brave was not terrible but was still very disappointing and Monsters University was good but still far from Pixar's best work. However, now we have the critically acclaimed Inside Out. I got to say, it was very well done but would I put it up along with my all-time favorite Pixar films? Well, let's see.",

It might have been a motion picture, or a short, or an episode of a television series, or a television mini-series, or even a full-blown comedic television series. Who knows? If it had been produced, it might have been on the air between 1991 and 1994. It might have been a live action series rather than an animated cartoon or computer generated imagery animation. It might have been about a male character with people in his head representing his thoughts, moods, emotions, or personalities, instead of a female character. Just to be sure it would not have been a complete copy, it might have had a completely different title. Like ""Herman's Head"". Just to be sure I completely made all of this up, feel free to look that title up in IMDb.",

Even so, ""Inside Out"" is an interesting look at the evolution of human emotions and the problems that people can have adjusting to a new location. I particularly liked the part where they showed dreams getting produced Hollywood-style. My personal favorite of the emotions was Anger, just because I liked the way that he was always about to explode. If there were another emotion in Riley's head, maybe it would be cynicism (is that considered an emotion?). I haven't seen any of 2015's other nominees for Best Animated Feature, so I can't compare this one, but it seems as though they only award Disney movies.",

326,28 July 2015,jboothmillard,8, Inside Out,"This new Disney/Pixar film, from the creators of Toy Story and Up, was being advertised a lot a few months before release, including in Sky Broadband and Subway adverts, the concept definitely looked appealing to me, and critics were giving it high praise, so I was really up for seeing it. Basically a girl named Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) is born in Minnesota, and her five key emotions were manifested one by one, Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Anger (Lewis Black), the emotions live in Headquarters, Riley's conscious mind, where they influence Riley's actions and memories via a control console. Riley's new memories created are stored in coloured orbs, they are all sent to storage at the end of every waking period, the most important ""core"" memories are housed in a Headquarters hub and power five ""islands"" each reflecting Riley's personality: Hockey Island - created from Riley's love for the sport, Goofball Island - created from Riley's fun-loving side, Family Island - created from her love of her family, Honesty Island - created from her honest nature, and Friendship Island - created from her ability to have and make friends. Joy is Riley's dominant emotion, keeping Riley in a happy state, she and the other emotions do not understand the purpose of Sadness, it is when Riley has turned 11 that her family are relocating to San Francisco after her Dad (Kyle MacLachlan) gets a new job, and Sadness is somehow causing happy memories to turn sad, and Sadness causes Riley to cry on her first day at her new school, causing a new sad ""core"" memory. Joy tries to dispose of this new memory, but she accidentally knocks core memories loose in a struggle with Sadness, and the shutdown of personality islands causing them to become unstable, and together Joy, Sadness and the core memories end up being sucked out of Headquarters through the memory tube, leading to the rest of Riley's mind, they end up in the labyrinth-like storage area of Riley's long-term memories. While Joy carrying the Core memories and Sadness are trying to get back to Headquarters, the three remaining emotions Anger, Disgust and Fear are attempting to maintain Riley's emotional state, but they inadvertently cause her to become distant from her Dad and Mom (Diane Lane), her friends and her hobbies, consequently her personality islands are crumbling and falling into the Memory Dump, an abyss where faded memories are disposed and forgotten. Anger decides to insert an idea for Riley to run away back to Minnesota, believing happy memories can be produced there, meanwhile Joy and Sadness have run into Riley's childhood imaginary friend Bing Bong (Richard Kind), who wishes to reconnect with her, he guides them back to Headquarters, telling them they can get there riding the Train of Thought, they explore different areas of Riley's mind along the way, including Dreamland and Imagination Land. They do eventually catch the train, but it becomes derailed with the collapse of another personality island, as Riley prepares to board a bus to Minnesota, Joy attempts to use a recall tube back to Headquarters, but the last personality island falls and breaks the tube, sending Joy and Bing Bong into the Memory Dump, she despairs and looks at memories, she finds a sad memory that became happy, when Riley lost a hockey game and was consoled by her parents, she realises Sadness's importance. Joy and Bing Bong find his discarded song- powered wagon to escape, but many failed attempts Bing Bong realises his weight is too much, so he jumps out on their final attempt and fades away in the abyss, Joy uses various tools from Imagination Land to propel herself and Sadness to Headquarters, there they find Anger's idea has disabled the control, making Riley depressed and almost unresponsive, returned Joy urges Sadness to take control, the idea is successfully removed, the console is reactivated and Riley is prompted to return home. Sadness reinstalls the core memories, Riley returns home and breaks down in tears, confessing to her parents she misses her old life, they reassure and comfort her, Joy and Sadness work together to create a combined core memory, it also creates a new personality island is created. A year later, Riley has adapted to her new life in San Francisco, all her emotions work together using an expanded control console and help her lead a happy and more emotionally complex life, with more new personality islands produced by new core memories combined by multiple emotions. Also starring Dave Goelz as Subconscious Guard Frank, Frank Oz as Subconscious Guard Dave, Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea as Mind Worker Cop Jake and John Ratzenberger as Fritz. The voice cast are all chosen well, the characters all have good personalities and the colourful nature of this film will appeal to younger audience members, while the voices inside your head concept and complicated emotions working together element will keep the older audience interested, it perhaps becomes overcomplicated in small places, but memories, emotions and the human mind are complex subjects, it is clever, creative and fun family movie, an enjoyable animated adventure comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Film, and it was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated.

336,6 July 2015,torfarrells,10, Inside Out's heartwarming tale is one of PIxar's best,"Pixar has proved itself to be more than a children's studio on numerous occasions— entertaining audiences of all ages— but never before have I seen anything so delightfully touching and smart as Inside Out was. Its perfectly layered switch-offs between reality and thoughts generate a mind boggling and colourful depiction of a somewhat normal young girl dealing with moving away. The emotions we see interact on screen are all personalities and features of the protagonist. The film generalizes a simple way to look at the mind of a human— categorizing our emotions into 5 characters: Joy (the gleeful and charming Amy Poehler), Sadness (""The Office"" alum Phyllis Smith), Anger (perfectly exaggerated by Lewis Black), Fear (a charming and frightful Bill Hader) and Disgust (the broccoli shaped scene- stealer voiced by the endearing and relatable Mindy Kaling). The movie doesn't just grab 11 year old girls or San Fransisco hockey players— it grabs all of us, and pulls us in to the extraordinary world of the reality. We need a little Office before Parks and Recreation— we need a little blue before yellow— we need a little sadness before joy, and that insightful little message plays through the movie like a roller-coaster; the disgust of looking at it— the anger of the line— the fear of the drop— the sadness of the long way down— and of course, the joy that follows.

The movie basically is all about Riley, or to be way more specific inside Riley's head with all her emotions being little well, who knows actually, they are just emotions with bodies. Of course the movie isn't all just in Riley's head, we see Riley act out the emotions she feels and how it affects her new life as her and her family start a new life in San Francisco.

It does work, and it's often quite clever in touching a broad range of delicate subjects in a way that can be appreciated by audiences young and old alike; no small balancing act. It's uproarious and cute and heady, but I couldn't shake the nagging feeling that we were just barely scratching the surface here, even as things began wrapping up. There's plenty brewing under the table, but it still feels superficial, and the big developments in the third act don't totally feel like they've been earned when the credits begin to roll. Granted, it's got a bushel of heavy messages to share, much more than many of its peers in the CG animation field, but when it's a delivery from the studio that brought us Toy Story, Monsters Inc. and Wall-E, there's a certain unspoken standard to meet. Inside Out represents a rebound for Pixar, certainly the best (and most creative) of their recent efforts, but it's not as sweeping, engulfing, or rewarding as the classic pedestals of their back catalog.",

361,12 June 2015,stephendaxter,9, A roller-coaster of 'emotions',"Inside out was one of my most anticipated movies of the year and it definitely did not disappoint. This movie was a roller-coaster of emotions the whole way through. It sends you from happy right down to sad and a little teary really quickly and then manages to get you laughing again within a few minutes, and to be able to pull that off is incredible. Lets start with those characters - the emotions, all of the emotions were very funny in their own unique way and seeing them all interact and clash made for many hilarious moments. They were most definitely the highlight of the film and rightfully so take up most of the screen time. I honestly cannot pick a favourite because they were all so different and so damn good. The voice acting performances were just do great and they all sounded exactly the way you think they would just by looking at them. Even when they switch over to the human perspective you still get great characters in the form of Riley, and her mum and dad to keep you entertained. Also the plot was great, it didn't slow down that much at all and was hilariously entertaining, it all made sense and offered many new and original plot points to keep you constantly interested. ",

Following the story of eleven-year old Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias) who moves with her family to San Francisco from her comfortable life in Minnesota, we experience her emotions going on her head as faces anxiety of her new home, new school, and a whole new life; and her emotions are represented by colored characters including: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust. Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler) is yellow, Sadness (voiced by Phyllis Smith) is blue, Fear (voiced by Bill Hader) is purple, and Disgust (voiced by Mindy Karling) is green.

It's hard to imagine anyone other than Parks and Recreation's enthusiastic Amy Poehler as Joy, or Sadness and Disgust being represented by people other than Phyllis Smith and Mindy Kaling (The Office US,) and Lewis Black was destined to play Anger in a film.

Where do our forgotten childhood memories and imaginary friends go? (On the other hand, if you still talk to or play with yours, you may have some serious issues which may require professional intervention.) Where are our cherished memories stored? What goes on inside our heads, dogs' heads, cats' heads/adolescent boys' heads? (hysterical). How do our thought processes evolve and how does our concept of the world around us change as we mature? All these questions and more are answered in this incredibly entertaining animated film from Disney and Pixar who have given us an actual original idea which is brilliantly conceived, directed and executed. I'm telling you now, this one wins the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. See it while it's still in theaters. You'll be uplifted, you'll be moved by the poignancy, you'll laugh out loud, you'll cry. (After all, It's Disney.) It features the amazing voice talents of Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Mindy Kaling, Diane Lane and Kyle McLachlan, all of whom are unrecognizable. Lewis Black, as Anger (of course) gives actors a master class in: It's not what you say. It's how you say it. Kids will love it, but won't appreciate the significance of the message. This is really an animated film for grownups. Score: 10. GO!! Don't miss it!",
371,25 June 2015,trvlers-77920,8, 8.8/10,"Here's the main difference between me and my 5-year-old son. I mean, clearly, there are many, including the fact that someday soon he'll be able to reach items on the high shelves in the kitchen without a step ladder. But this latest one lies in the way we each reacted to ""Inside Out,"" the new animated epic from Pixar, which takes place mainly within the mind of an 11- year-old girl. Nicolas' favorite part was when the girl's sense of Fear (voiced by Bill Hader) runs around screaming with his butt ablaze, courtesy of a blast of fire from her Anger (Lewis Black). He also liked when Joy (Amy Poehler) was playfully talking to herself. ""Joy is funny,"" the budding film critic added. My favorite part was everything else. The ambition. The intelligence. The complexity. The performances. The poignancy. Director and co-writer Pete Docter's film is as beautiful as it is profound, lively as it is meaningful. This is a movie that dares to explore existential crises, in the middle of the summer, in an animated movie that's aimed at the whole family. And damned if it doesn't pull it off. Like the best Pixar movies — ""Up,"" ""The Incredibles"" and my personal favorite, ""WALL-E"" — it functions quite powerfully on multiple levels at once. And similar to ""Ratatouille,"" in a lot of ways ""Inside Out"" isn't really for kids primarily, even though the figure at its center, Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias), is on the brink of adolescence, with all the recognizable angst that accompanies this shift. Children will certainly respond to the movie's spry energy, vibrant colors and clever humor. The script from Docter, Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley is one of the more substantive ones yet in a Pixar film — and don't forget, Docter previously directed and co-wrote ""Monsters Inc."" and ""Up"" — but it's also very, very funny, often in a slapsticky way. Er go, the butt on fire. A little bit on the premise, in case this all sounds a tad confusing and abstract. Riley has just moved from Minneapolis to San Francisco with her parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan). This would be a difficult transition to make at any time in your childhood, but especially now. Eleven is such an awkward age — such a jumble of extreme emotions — which ""Inside Out"" keenly understands and demonstrates by going inside her brain to show us what she's thinking or feeling at any particular moment. Besides Joy, Anger and Fear, there's Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). When Riley was a little girl, her experiences and memories were all so clear-cut, they were color-coded. The happy ones, like scoring her first hockey goal, remain in the infrastructure of her brain as orbs that glow a bright yellow; the unpleasant ones, like being forced to eat broccoli as an infant, radiate a dark green. And the feelings themselves were reliable in their consistency. Joy always has been perky and resilient and glass-half-full (and Poehler does nimble voice work in playing a character that's the pixellated manifestation of her irresistible demeanor). But lately, the blue and bespectacled Sadness has come to the fore, between the move and all the disconcerting changes occurring both around her and inside her. Reminiscent of Eeyore in the ""Winnie the Pooh"" realm, Sadness is dryly hilarious — so pathetic and so sweet — and so often, the voice of reason. She's the one who's willing to speak the raw truth in an uncomfortable situation. And Smith, with her vulnerable and beautifully nuanced performance, ends up being the movie's unexpected MVP. From here, ""Inside Out"" follows how Riley — and the many sides of her — adapt, or don't. Her journey features many inspired, light moments, from the physical manifestation of a brain freeze while you're enjoying a cold treat to an annoying TV jingle that gets stuck in your head. But it has plenty of dramatic ones, too, including the relationship Riley's emotions have with her long-lost imaginary friend, Bing Bong, voiced heartbreakingly by Richard Kind. (Seriously, ""Inside Out"" rivals ""Toy Story 3″ for the kind of ugly crying it'll provoke in you.) It may meander a tad in the literal labyrinth of Riley's mind as these figures struggle to work together to help her restore her shattered sense of self. But mostly, ""Inside Out"" remains sharp with some really sophisticated notions about the nature of memories — which ones we hold onto, where they sit in the brain, how long we keep them, how they shape our personalities and even how they help us forge relationships. It might sound dull or even didactic, but this being a Pixar film, ""Inside Out"" brings these concepts brilliantly to life. If my son can begin to grasp the idea that happiness and sadness can co-exist within the same moment — but also cackle so hard at a bit of physical comedy that his face turns red and the veins pop out on his neck — then we're onto something truly memorable here.",

Inside Out has the perfect balance of comedy, emotion and intelligence - yes that's right, this is a truly intelligent movie. It's stocked with metaphors and is pretty deep for a kid's movie. I read that one of the ""goofs"" was that Fear tried to get sucked out of the same tube that Joy and Sadness got taken away in and it failed. Personally, I didn't see that as a goof, but it was purposeful. All the events that happen inside Riley's mind have a purpose - joy and sadness get lost, leaving emotions like Fear, Anger and Disgust take over. Natural feelings that anyone would have in a new city, with no new friends, at the young, precarious age of 11. ",

The plot is familiar but the creativity and conceptualisation of Pixar to tell the story from inside the mind of a girl using five different emotions - joy, sadness, anger, disgust and fear have brought their latest picture to secure the Oscars. Not only focusing on the emotions, the story further expands into memories (short/ long-term and core memories), imagination, dreams and forgetfulness in a fantastic landscape to construct the feeling, mind, reaction and soul of the main character. This original approach connects well both the adults and children, emotionally engaging, entertaining, visually colorful and inspiring.

The film is slow.Very slow. It has some good moments but it is not thrilling.
Joy tries to prevent sadness from creating sad core memories and therefore they are lost in Riley's memory.They try to go back and fix this before she loses her joy and personality. But it is somewhat ridiculous.
This quest is not interesting. I got very bored watching this.And I like animation, it's just that this one fails.
The idea is interesting but it is not well executed. I do not think that this movie was made for kids, it is more of an adult movie. It is not funny at all. It is depressing. It also makes no sense. Why Riley's parents sold their beautiful house and bought this horrendous house in San Francisco? And why didn't they try to clean their house.The house was awful.It is not a place for a kid to live. And all these weird stuff. Imaginary friends,broccoli pizza, scary clowns. The script is plain and absurd.

I mean first of all five emotions were acting like themselves except sadness. She wasn't sad she was clearly depressed. When you are sad you want to cry out your lungs yet she was hopeless and tired all the time. And the main message of the movie didn't make sense to me at all. The depression which Riley's been suffering was not something crying and experiencing the sadness would've fixed which she wasn't even denying being sad from the beginning just at some point sadness decided to go. And when it was back it stopped Riley from running away from home?How? Why?Was she sad she was going to be alone? I mean her feeling sad just should've made it harder and longer her acceptance of her new conditions for all I see with its presence.Or maybe sadness cornered her saying if you want to avoid pain avoid me just accept all of this I don't know maybe this was the message intended.,

Mindy Kaling( from The Office) for Disgust, Bill Hader( from Identical Twins) for Fear , Phyllis Smith( again from The Oficce) for sadness(my favorite) and Amy Poehler for Joy( terrific) & Lewis Black for Anger (liked him in Accepted) did a great job.

Riley is a happy child but then her life suddenly changes when her family moves and a sequence of unfortunate events happens. A large part of the story happens ""inside her"" and shows her emotions as characters. The character of Joy has always been the one in control until Sadness makes an unfortunate error that puts them both on a journey of discovery inside Riley and they both discover who Riley really is.

They have changed the way films are made, and each movie since 'Toy Story 1' in 1995 has been a success both critically and financially, making Pixar one of the biggest movie studios ever. Hell, all of the Pixar films combined have made over $9 billion (with a ""B"") at the box office. That's not to mention home video or merchandising sales. Since 'Toy Story III' in 2010, there has only been three Pixar movies, all of which have been less favored to Pixar's previous films including 'Wall-E', 'Up', and the third 'Toy Story' movie.",

We also meet Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear and Anger, personifications of her emotions who live inside her head and contribute towards her memories – colour-coded globes which build into a library and a series of interconnected city-like structures which embody the key aspects of Riley's emotional growth. Her life is mostly happy until the family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco, and everything familiar which she loved is gone. The loss of what she loved leads to a crisis in Headquarters which leaves Joy, the sole positive emotion, fighting a losing battle to protect the fragile structures built up over Riley's 11 years.",

However, these hiccups don't really detract much from the overall thematic thrust and inherent brilliance of the material itself. The script is endlessly inventive and insightful in a way few films are these days, and the voice actors are at the top of their game here, especially Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith. Although Inside Out may not quite be the studio's masterpiece, the film is certainly among its finest work (and the best since Toy Story 3 back in 2010). More importantly, Inside Out officially puts to rest any doubts that Pixar is still the king when it comes to delivering meaningful, imaginative family entertainment. Case closed.",

I like Pixar and are almost always impressed by how they can make humor work on many different levels, for young and grown-ups at the same time. Inside out, however, is not an all out ha-ha comedy, as many (if not all) of the other Pixar movies are. Still funny, but there is more room and food for thought in this one, and above all, there is a beauty to it. It is a balanced movie, with humor, about growing up. About growing to accept that life is a mix of feelings, and that that enhances memories. That life isn't clear cut, but complex. And Pixar handles that really well too, in addition to the humor. Even more impressive.",

Watching it you can't help but think what emotion is in control right know? Is it Anger? Sadness? or Joy? Pixar shows how much fun they can make movies but that they also have a big heart, unlike most animated movies now. Pixar crafts this movie in ways that make sense like: why you don't remember when you were a baby, why you remember certain things well and others not so much, and what happens when you feel a bunch of different emotions at once. I had a blast watching The Emotions fight over what Riley should do or say.

I mean, the idea was clever but it just did not turn out well. I did not like Reilly or any of the other emotions as they were annoying and so unlikeable. Joy is very selfish and annoying, Sadness is so irritating, the other emotions are just plain annoying. Also, Reilly has no personality. Yes, we do see her ""islands"" but if you watch the Reilly only scenes of the movie, you will notice that she is so bland and also selfish. Seriously, you are not in quarantine, Reilly! I also disliked the story. In the beginning, the introduction was so long and the story was so slow.
I also noticed that during the whole story, Joy and Sadness did the same thing over and over again throughout most of the movie: 1) Get to Island X. 2)Something happens to Reilly. 3) Island falls. 4) Go through random obstacles to get to the next one. I also disliked the messages the movie was trying to teach kids:1) You are not responsible for your actions. 2) You have no control over your life. 3) If your sad, your problems will be solved if you look sad. People will come and sort it out and you will feel joy again.",

Your disgust at how different the food is in the new city. Inside the control room Joy and Sadness have been transported to another part of Riley's brain. They are trying to make it back to the control room so Riley can experience Joy and Sadness again. Two emotions we need in every day life. The metaphors for the emotions you go through in life are really well explored here. There are some touching moments. Very funny moments, and scary moments. This is stuff we all go through in everyday life. .Kids will love this film and so will adults. The animation as always with Pixar is amazing. The voices are very well done.

However, this kind of repression can lead to collapse of 'personality islands'. This movie really patted my shoulder and told me expression of sadness is okay. Even though the animation film is misleadingly considered for kids, messages delivered in this film are deep and philosophical.

Monsters (2001) did this too and was also from the same director. I can image it's hard to predict if you can make such an idea into a great movie. Well it turns out it's rather difficult. The biggest problem this movie has is the characters. They are certainly not as good as those in the Toy Story movies, they just don't seem to be as likable even tough Pixar really tries to make you like 'em. What I did like was that the film sometimes felt a bit bleaker and surrealistic (a kind of Alice in Wonderland feel) than most other Pixar flicks. It does seem strange that a film which revolves around emotions struggles a bit with just that as it has difficulty emotionally involving the audience. I certainly don't think it's a bad film, in my book it's still way better than those lame Cars films but it's not in the Pixar top list.",

Months later, the movie is getting closer to release, and I finally saw the theatrical trailer, and it sold me. From the start of this movie, the visuals are beautiful. And I'm not just talking about the art style, which is beautiful as well. It's just the things the show you is truly magnificent. Really great imagery. I love the emotion characters so much. It was really awesome to see a fictionalization of what goes on in someone's brain. It opened up a new realm of metaphors and imagination. This really made me think about what emotion is controlling my brain and all that. I'm not gonna spoil what it's about, but the plot is very effective. I absolutely love this movie, and Joy is now one of my favourite Disney characters. The animation is stunning, the movie is funny, the voice acting is great, the characters are great and... I cried 3 times during this movie. This was a powerful film with a great message. I give it 9.5/10 - A near perfection.

I don't want to be reminded how precious childhood memories of my kids will fade for them and they will have less pure joy as they grow. Six is for the few comedic moments and great story but it is not a favourite Pixar movie. Far from it. I would watch Big Hero 6 multiple times even though it has some heavy moments.

I would have liked to have seen more from Anger, Fear and Disgust, the main characters are certainly Joy and Sadness, but the scenes in the headquarters between those three characters are some of my favourites and I would have loved to have seen more of it, also I think Bing Bong, who is easily my favourite character in this film, could have been developed more. The voice cast is absolutely outstanding, perfectly conveying the emotions of their characters, Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith are both perfectly casted, as are the other emotions, and Kaitlyn Dias also delivers the voice of Riley, an eleven year old girl, very well, Pixar never mess up with voice acting. Hilarious and very emotional, family members of all ages will love Inside Out, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film, it's the best Pixar movie since Toy Story 3. ",

Still, they are able to take on some aspects of each other's personalities in away that doesn't compromise their own.

453,2 November 2016,edacheeky,10, An emotional roller-coaster,"This film hit home hard. In its exploration of the human mind through a coming of age story, Inside Out explores how our personalities form as we age. This is truly an emotional tale. I was choking back tears all throughout. This film really touched me on a personal level. Each emotion is portrayed as its own entity that has control over the person whose mind they reside in. They each help produce memories associated with each emotion. From this film we learn that each emotion is essential to have and experience and each plays its own significant role. We learn particularly the importance of sadness. Sadness, although an emotion we tend to resent, is a very important emotion. Experiencing pain and sadness is important in growth. When we experience a crisis, our lives turn upside down. But it is during times like these that we experience the most growth. At the end Riley's core memories change and her new memories have mixed instead of single emotions. This expresses Riley's emotional growth. Thus, this coming of age story is one of emotional growth and personality development that we can all relate to. It's something new from Disney and Pixar and I love it.",

If they suddenly wreak mayhem totally out of character, it's not their fault at all, INSIDE OUT suggests. Blame it, rather, on the tiny voices quarreling constantly from one end of their brains to the other. Advice, rules, cautions, responsibilities, social norms, parental expectations, American Values, homework, politeness, best behaviors, decency, kindness, daily chores, proper decorum, and common sense can all be thrown to the winds whirling inside each child's noggin. Their very self-hood is shown to be based upon a relatively small handful of memories subject to gross distortion at the drop of a hat. INSIDE OUT personifies the Aging Process as a callously cackling cleaning crew clearing cherished memories off the Cliff of Self Awareness into the Chasm of Forgetfulness. Disney pictures a Child's Mind as a miniature Disneyland, complete with ""Imagination Island,"" ""Goofball Island,"" and so on. The Mouse House's clear implication is that if you don't refresh your kids' minds at Disneyland regularly, they're liable to take a bus to Duluth--or worse!

The visualization of our mental faculties was so smartly done(if i was to teach psychology i would start the course with this picture), the humor was sometimes so surrealistic and weird, the emotions stayed so well in character ;-), the craft that was necessary to make this was overwhelming. My son asked me to name movies of comparable genius and i had a hard time naming one. Or i have to compare apples and oranges, which i won't do here. (animated movies that come to mind here, right now are Spirited Away and Mary and Max) Anyway, without exaggerating, this was a work of art that makes life worth living",

461,14 August 2016,mcancea,10, Inside Out Review,Pixar last year made a movie that blew me away compared to the cars movies that suck. No spoilers because you need to see it without seeing much from people spoiling for you because this is a experience like many great Pixar movies like toy story or the incredibles . This has many things that are just amazing it can make you cry this movies main plot is about emotions in a girl named Riley and that's all I will say because you don't need info on it because there nothing to ruin because it's a masterpiece by Pixar and gets a 9 it has its flaws that are little but overall in. My top 10 Animations of all Time Maybe it's that good. ,
462,3 November 2015,eferhild2010,5, Nothing here for adults.,"I like animated films but usually if it's PG you get some inside adult jokes but nothing but childish thoughts here. Stay away if you expect a Shrek type movie. The acting is good and the story is great for kids but I was disappointed that there is nothing here for adults. If you are going to the movies to pay premium prices and expensive candy then the adults should get some enjoyment as well. I think this is the worst Pixar film to date. Remember Adults pay for the time, money and the time it takes to make the money to go see a movie. Don't waste the adults time here. Certain adults I can understand would enjoy this film but mature adults will not enjoy this film in the theater. Wait to get it on Blu-Ray and leave the room while your children enjoy this good movie for them.",
463,19 May 2019,Benjamin-M-Weilert,9, Relatable on many levels.,"I'm now convinced that if Pixar wanted to jump across the uncanny valley, they could probably do it. Not only does this film improve upon their already impressive visual style, but it does so in a way that brings that inexpiable time in our lives into coherence. Sure, they do stick to the cliches of film (including some they've mastered as well), but a lot of this film wouldn't work if we all hadn't experienced these things at one point or another.",

The idea has turned up intermittantly in popular culture ever since (including, cinematically, in the hands of Woody Allen, who played a sperm in one of his early films). In 'Inside Out', a girl is controlled by an entire team of mini-mes; but for me, this isn't one of the great Pixar movies. The plot is basically 'Toy Story' redux, and, while there are some good gags, the film lacks the internal coherence of the best Pixar work, and mostly paints with a broad brush. You won't find the subtle beauty of 'WALL-E' or 'Up' here; although I did like the cat, walking on the keyboard.",

467,19 June 2015,tjgoalie13,10, Funny and Touching.,"Inside Out is a funny, heartwarming, and deep journey into the human mind. Pixar has a filmography that's hard to match, and things will remain that way if they keep putting out films of this caliber. As per usual the story is well crafted, and inventive, but the most impressive thing is the use of humor to help the moments of true drama. By that I mean the film has a relatable humor, that anybody can laugh at and have a good time with, so when the film decides to get serious it hits the audience even deeper. This something Pixar's always been good at, but this movie has some of the most touching moments since Up. On top of the brilliant use of humor, the visuals are stunning, the voice acting is perfect, and the characters are surprisingly well crafted. In the end Inside Out is one of Pixar's best films in the last 5 years, and is worth seeing on the big screen.",
468,7 July 2015,estreet-eva,7, Pretty good on the Pixar scale,"Featuring a clever conceit and the standard glorious Pixar animation, ""inside Out"" fails to fail like ""Cars 2"" or ""Brave"" but doesn't become an instant classic like ""Monsters University"" or ""Wall-E."" As usual the world-building -in this case the internal monolouge of an eleven- year old girl - yields an immersive and discuss-able experience. It falls somewhat short of, say, ""The Incredibles"" when it comes to snappy dialog or repeatable lines. The fact that line where the character Sadness is told to ""be positive"" and responds with ""I'm positive we're going to get lost"" actually makes the trailer gives you a sense of the weakness of the script. The voice-acting and cast choices are solid if not bold - see Lewis Black as ""Anger"". In short, well worth seeing although you could wait until it shows up on streaming video.",

Another excellent premise from Pixar, it is used well and the result is moving and heartfelt. While not a flawless film, Inside Out is a very good animated film and one of the more sophisticated ones from recent times. As always the visuals are gorgeous and the film is rendered wonderfully while the direction is also top form. As can be expected from Pixar the script has emotion, big laughs and thrills which it wrings out of its fascinating premise to maximum effect. There are many funny bits, especially involving the Anger character and there's a considerable amount of suspense involved to. The world inside the girl's head is brilliantly thought out and successfully brought to life.",
473,21 June 2015,ayoreinf,7," Well, Sadness is a necessary emotion, did I just spend 94 minutes to learn that?","I know' this review will be torn to shreds by most of you other reviewers and readers, as this has long turned into a highest praise competition. A competition I can't join, since personally I was sourly disappointed. This movie, is not as original as most of the viewers claim if you really think so go and check out an early 90s series called Herman's Head, in which we saw the story develops inside Herman's head where four characters controlled his behaviour, basically sensitivity, lust, fear and intellect. A much better division than the five almost randomly picked emotions chosen here.But originality is not the issue here, I said more than once that I don't rate originality as is so very highly, and if this was a good story I wouldn't mind a second hand idea and a random choice of emotions. This is not a good story, I find it hard to explain why without adding a spoiler, but I'm willing to explain my point in details to whomever will challenge me to do so by mail or via the IMDb message box. I promise to answer each and every one no matter how many there will be. All I can say here that we do get high drama, with some very inventive ideas and some very high quality performances, especially so Richard Kind and Phyllis Smith, but almost everyone here does the job to the highest standards. And still it all ends with a whimper, without any real resolution taking place on screen. Yes life goes on is a true statement, but it's not the reason we all came to see this movie. Not with all the hype that preceded. And I still think Up and Wall-E were true masterpieces, not just as animation but as movies by any standard. This one isn't. It's an extended pilot to a new TV series where the idea that life goes on would feel right, but then we won't need all this extra drama and meandering plot line.",
474,1 July 2015,irinaidu,10, Excellent !,"I just saw this movie last night and I immensely enjoyed it. I am not sure if kids would enjoy it as much, since a lot of the dialogue requires some knowledge that might not be for kids. I did not understand why so many of the reviewers said it was a sad movie. I thought that it was an emotional movie, but in no way sad. It is a story about growing up and this, by definition, has bitter sweet moments - that's the point of the movie. It's not a comedy movie and I don't understand why so many people complained that they did not laugh enough. I thought almost all concepts presented were funny, but still I would not say the point of the movie was to get belly laughs. But come on, there are so many nice and subtle fun comments. I totally recommend this movie, if you are the kind that enjoys cartoons and if you are not looking for belly laughs, but for a nice, warm, funny , smart story !",

The Cars sequel was the most prominent evidence that they're a business that wants money. While the first is enjoyable for what it is, I couldn't get through the first 15 minutes of number 2. Brave was a complete misfire, structurally incompetent, painfully unfunny and I haven't been able to watch anything Scottish since. Their Oscar leaves a sour taste on the category. However, I am a staunch defender of Monsters University, a film that may follow pleasant kid formula for the first breezy two thirds but develops into a heartfelt lesson of perseverance in its final act. I can't argue that it wasn't a necessary film. Now they're on the rebound, a take 2 on an original property with a female focus and at least we can say that the Pixar the public and critics love whole- heartedly is back. ",

Inside Out doesn't disappoint, in this regard is spectacular. With a dazzling visual along with bringing to life such charismatic and beautiful characters, Inside Out turns out to be a wonderful movie. Each emotion is unique and the film makes sure of it by making them have different personalities, the distinctive ways that each emotion makes you smile and their singular and vibrant color skin. Each one has their role and relevance with no need to overshadow the others. Just with the visual, this movie already stands out, but, beyond that, Pixar delivers one of the best stories of its productions, this original and bold plot kept me on the edge of my seat for being so emotional and involving. It takes place in the mind of a 11-year girl named Riley who is suffering big changes in her life. Inside her head, five emotions are managing the control center, Joy, Fear, Sadness, Disgust and Anger. Each feeling has at least one shining and incredible moment.",

The film is deep in an emotional way and even with the emotions of a little girl visualized for us to understand what she's feeling, there is still room for narrative subtlety. The emotions don't control us; they merely reflect the turmoil we face in life and the battle is almost completely internal for some people. That's what makes Inside Out such a good film; it's not just a magnificent story done with beautiful and sparkly visuals, but a thesis on the human psychology shown through animation. ",

Sure, it may not be a tearjerker (for me, anyway) but it's something that directly applies to every single person viewing. It may very well be the most universally targeted Pixar film because, similarly to what Toy Story 3 set out to accomplish, the fundamental message of the film has to do with the way we view childhood as we age. It's told in a way that is 100% kid-friendly but also has a message that will appeal to adults.
Of course, it lives up to the gold-standard expectation from Pixar: beautiful animation, well-crafted story, a talented crew of voices to really make it all come to life.

The emotions of Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear are given life as real characters who steer the young girl Riley, who's life we follow from birth to age 13. It takes great imagination to write a story like this and I applaud Pixar for this one.

I will say however that this is one of Pixar's most well thought out movies and that it will influence audiences to come back again and again; this time catching something they didn't the first time.

I also don't prefer overly ""kiddie"" movies anymore, thanks to no longer being a kid. That being said, INSIDE OUT is one of Pixar's better films, even if I didn't love it as much as something like UP. To its credit, INSIDE OUT is actually more geared towards the older crowd, since a lot of the psychology of emotions will probably go over younger children's heads. In this sense, Pixar finds themselves in a bit of a bind. While expertly realized visually, literalizing the emotions just makes their manipulation that much more evident and, in my opinion, less effective. That's not to say it's all bad, because there were a number of moments that I thought were cute and funny. Its greatest fault is slow-burning an emotional payoff on top of such a thin story. In the end, though, I was won over thanks to the excellent visuals, inventive conceptualization, and outstanding voice work. Lewis Black as Anger has to be one of the best, and most spot-on, castings ever. It also wouldn't be a Pixar movie without a tearjerking moment or two. When it's all said and done, INSIDE OUT isn't the best Pixar movie ever, but it's an improvement over their last few.",
520,9 November 2015,cleargraphics,8," This addition is one of Pixar's better achievements, in my opinion.","Inside Out is a story where all the emotions of a person are individuals inside a person's brain with a command and control center and the story gets clever and insightful with that theme, especially in dealing with memories of the past.

I then opened imdb and saw a massive wave of bad reviews made by people who clearly doesn't understand the first thing about movies.
This movie has an extremely important theme.. It delves into our deepest emotions. And the way we look at the world growing up. We deal with loneliness, frustration, anger, jealousy, and it's the transition from child to adult.. it's not easy to leave behind the things we loved as kids and now we need to all of the sudden be grown up and deal with constant change around us..We are very vulnerable in this period.. 
and I feel like this movie beautifully illustrates some of the frustrations inside our minds.. of curse it's made with beautiful animation and it's just a take on how It could look inside our minds. Made to a child's enjoyment. And for myself as well. I'm 21 years old and I LOVED this movie.. it spoke to my inner child. And I got really moved by this film.. I even shed a tear towards the end..
Definitely one of the best Pixar movies for sure! Two big thumbs up! Keep em coming Pixar!",

All through the film, Joy is focused on making sure Riley never feels the emotional pain of being sad, especially when Riley is put through her first real time Of emotional turbulence in her young life through her moving across the country and leaving behind everything she loves and now misses desperately. By the end of the movie, Riley ends up in the arms of her mom and dad crying and finally allowing herself to express what she is feeling inside. And at the same time, Joy realizes that in attempting to keep Sadness from influencing Rileys world, she has been denying Riley what she has truly needed...Riley needs to be sad. Children have a hard time comprehending adult world problems and parents need to teach their children that some times if you need to be sad, it's okay to be sad. Sadness is what allows you to enjoy the good times. There can not be joy without sadness. This film had me welling up in my Theater chair more than once and I'm a 24 year old man.",

526,25 June 2015,tangojazz,10, The greatest psychology cartoon ever made!,"A great movie that appeals equally to children and adults. Not once did I turn away from the screen, which to me is a sure sign of the movie's greatness. ""Inside Out"" is movie about the inner psychology of girl child named Riley from her birth to about eleven years old. The engine that drives the movie is the psychological changes that occurs when Riley's family moves from their home in Minnesota to the San Francisco Bay Area. The changes are represented amusingly enough by cartoon characters called Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Anger and Fear, in both Riley and her parents. To be honest with you, I had some reservations about seeing ""Inside Out."" The previous features I had seen about psychological change in people were pretty serious affairs: ""Steppenwolf"" adapted from the novel by Herman Hesse and starring Max Von Sydow, and ""A Dangerous Method"" directed by Horror Meister David Cronenberg and starring Viggo Mortensen and Keira Knightly. Movies definitely not for kids. So, I said to myself, how will Disney make a movie about such a loaded subject? Easy. Stay away from topics like mental illness and pathological criminality, and stick to child and family psychology. Throw in a lot of humor and cartoon slapstick, and you have a movie that talks about emotional growth without the more serious consequences (Although the movie does surprisingly goes to some pretty dark places in the mind, like the subconscious). Comedians Amy Poehler, Mindy Kaling and Lewis Black give outstanding performances as the various emotions that, for me, carry the movie. Go see this wonderful movie about ""Psychology 101"" and also, be entertained.",

532,30 March 2020,kermitkid,10, Genuine,"This is not only one of the best animated films of the year, it's one of the best films of the year, period. I'm glad to see Pixar slowly returning to form, by making charming, original films for the whole family. I've noticed that they've evolved from making movies that were considered ""kids films"" and going into deeper, more complex themes. As the audience who first saw Toy Story in 1995 (20 years ago) has grown up, so have Pixar's movies grown up with them. Pixar does the impossible. They make films for older audiences, while at the same time keeping them appropriate for the children who want to see it. We all know that this will win Best Animated Film at the Oscars next year simply because it has the Pixar name attached to it, but this is one of those times where I agree. (So far. That may change, because we still have Minions, Hotel Transylvania 2, Peanuts, and Pixar's next film The Good Dinosaur coming out this year.) I enjoyed the more subtle bits of humor for older audiences, that 10 years from now kids will rewatch this film and say ""oh, now I get it."" I thought I would be able to predict the plot, but the movie proved me wrong. I was not able to predict any of the plot other than what was shown in the trailers. This is one of Pixar's best. It makes up for Brave and Cars 2. I liked those, just not as much. I wouldn't say those are their best. This movie made me very emotional. (No pun intended) It's definitely a film that little kids won't appreciate as much as older audiences, because it's so deep. There is also a short before the movie called ""Lava"" about 2 volcanoes who fall in love. I thought that was great, too. The whole story was told through an island song which I felt was very unique. That definitely deserves some Oscar love too in the Best Animated Short category.",

I know I did, helped along by the ' Numbskulls' comic strip in my 'Beezer', 'Topper' or 'Whizzer and Chips' comics back in the 60s and 70s! In any case the latest Disney/Pixar effort proves the enduring appeal of this childhood conceit and affirms the greatness of the imagineers behind the now singular studio. Imagination runs riot as we explore the emotional development of a human girl, the early scenes give insight not just to the plot of the movie itself, but also into the flight of imagination that the imagineers are going to take us on during the next 90 minutes. At times the pictures are gorgeously beautiful and the thought behind them so detailed and finalised ...... the way the 'Emotions/characters' have fuzzy almost gaseous edges, reminding me of the nature of life at such high resolution is a stroke of pure genius! Credit to producers who grounded the films leading cipher (Riley, the little girl in whose head we journey) in a modern reality far from the Disney princess model, but who resisted the urge to reference ephemeral cultural memes (making the movie more likely to survive being 'dated' and less narrowly culturally American, than it might otherwise have been (and some other recent similar releases have been). The psychological development rationale for the characters journeys to 'HQ' are sometimes a little convoluted and not followed through, and in the second half of the movie this could lead to disengagement with the plot and the emotional heart line. But the pay off at the end is as warm and touching as one might hope and has come to expect from the imagineers, so all is well. Positioned well for a sequel (and after Toy Story 4, why not?) it's a ride I would take again and again. Beautiful, warm, touching and potentially timeless.",

It is clear that a large sector of the American population (including our politicos) have become allergic to sadness, shunting all appropriate sadness into anger (FYI, the driving force behind these negative reviewers here). Men (especially) tend to be diabolically afraid of sadness and will shunt it to anger. That's why I am so amazed how this movie got it SO RIGHT. The creators must have had a lot of insight and/or input from (good) psychological thinkers. I love the scene with Sadness and the pink elephant -- Sadness listened to him (and tolerated his crying) - yielding his joy. Sadness is cathartic and we are evolved to benefit from this emotion.

Inside Out is the most brilliantly thought out, original animation in Pixar's history. For all audiences to enjoy. Centering on a young girl named Riley, there is two sides to her story. The external one is simple: Riley and her parents move away from their home in Minnesota where she grew up, to downtown San Francisco. The internal one is more complex. An assortment of characters make up Riley's emotions. Very similar to The Numbskulls in The Beano comic. There's Joy (Poehler), Fear (Hader), Anger (Black), Disgust (Kaling) and Sadness (Smith). They control Riley's actions and reactions. Her brain is a complex machine. New memories are created, shaped in to colours matching the emotion (yellow for joy, blue for sadness etc.) and filed in to a huge maze-like database. There's the core memories, powering certain parts of Riley's personality. They part from their usual spot that keeps the cogs spinning, throwing Riley's external emotions in to chaos. Joy and Sadness, separated from the brain's hub, need to make their way back before Riley loses her personality traits completely. Inside Out is a joyful experience, even when it's sad. A movie for the masses. A playful understanding on how certain minds work, how families can come together, and how life needs every emotion once in a while.

That doesn't mean to say it's not worth watching because it is, but it just got a bit stale through the middle where it's a wee bit stop/start in certain places, and got a bit repetitive with some of the characters.

Joy discusses how everything going well in headquarters and work alongside the others. all seems fine until Riley's parents decides to move to San Francisco after Riley's father gets a new job.with a new home and new school it's all the turmoil for Riley. to overcome this joy tries to make the best of it until sadness alters a core memory and both are thrown from headquarters they must find a way back. Riley can get her personality and life back on track. Riley and even her parents makes the perfect cast in this film to connect to as the audience. At some point a lot of People go through this ordeal with having to move away from home and having to start a new and demanding that is a challenge of mentally and emotionally.When describing the emotions joy is overall a de facto leader she's overly vibrant and full of energy. she comes off rather a control freak who thinks that her way is best that Riley is happy 24/7 and doesn't really care for the others interfere. Sadness is sadness she's depressed she's unmotivated and a downer but she has in her own way of understanding and slowly over the course Joy sees her purpose and how she is important. Anger disgust and fear also play a part in showing how drastically they can alter Riley's choices and affect her life. They all act in such a way that you can see a bit of yourself in each one of them in someway. There's a scene where they put an idea lightbulb in Riley's thought and she follows through on it just like that. It plays off of that aspect that when you have an idea you don't fully think on it and most likely we will just act on it at first hand. The theme of this movie Emotions and feelings are many highlights where you feel for the characters and feel the same as they do. you feel happy and energetic you feel moments of sadness and you care for the situation. Particularly with Riley's imaginary friend being bong moments in this movie feel rather organic and in my ways people can actually relate. Visually the film is stunning arguably one of Pixar's most colorful movies both figuratively and literally. The music set to a soothing piano tune appropriates it's calm and somber tone.

This is a common problem for teachers in this transition time. The time when the child is to big to be a child and to child to be big. The time when all the imagination is lost and reality impacts to stay for ever. This problem, teacher know well, is marvelous treated in this movie from the inside world of the child from 5 basic emotions. It's shows how the child world collapses, in order to create a new world, the world that will be the adult world. Wonderful story from Pixar imagination that shows how the child is lost, and how the child joy has to learn to manage sadness in order to grow. Many times I ask myself when the ""child magic world ends"", this movie shows clearly how this happens. In my case was when I complete my primary school and starts the secondary studies. This movie works exactly with that time period, and use an external problem to trigger that process This is a movie to learn a lot about your child, and yourself, it is not an pure entertainment.

I went to see twice this movie, and both times the people who were around me, drop a tear. It has really emotionally intense moments that will make you feel humble for who you were and what you are now, the train of life. This is a masterpiece and i encourage everyone to watch it.

I was 19 when I watched it and I felt like it was the sort of materials I would expose my kids to. I am sorry for having to spoil the plot for you but it is just fascinating how by the end, they linked memories to sadness, and it is sadness that saved the girl. And i believe they wanted to say more by that. We all look at sadness as a bad thing, as an unwanted thing and true, being sad messes things up (just like in the movie) but sometimes being sad is just to find balance, and it isn't that bad thing. I liked when the old imaginary friend of the little girl sacrificed himself to help joy and sadness find their way, I found that very beautiful and expressing. Sometimes things from our past need to send us free so that we can move forward but that doesn't mean that those thongs weren't real, at least, to us. I also found the way Joy treated Sadness beautiful to discuss. Joy tried her best to be nice to sadness, but only when sadness is watching. Joy was, clearly, faking it around sadness for she thought that sadness doesn't know how to have fun which is very true but that is only because that's who sadness is and people should be accepted for who they are.

The humor is probably too difficult for children to understand and definitely too bad for adults. The two main characters (emotions) were also the two most annoying ones.

623,30 August 2018,angelicaripari-10774,10, It was a worthy award,"In Inside out we are introduced to a different idea about growing up, about life experiences, thereby producing a distinct movie. It's an animation which shows us about the routine of one child. It's about the childhood, but not only for kids. Because it reflects on our feelings and changes.
The main one character is Joy. She is the first feeling that Riley had when she was born. Since then, Joy controls the emotions and the memories of Riley. This is the reason of Joy's existence.
After the appearance of Joy, others secondary feelings share the mind of Riley - Anger, Disgust, Fear and Sadness. All they have their roles by decisions or actions of Riley, but by that time Joy always head the situations.
The journey of the story starts when Riley, that is now 11 years old, moves to another city and her comfortable routine, with her friends, habits, liking, are shattered. These changes have impacted her emotions. So, the characters of her feelings enter in conflict too.
Joy try administering the situation, but she needs to learn how to deal with Sadness, her counterpart.

625,8 November 2020,tamsin-parker-262-538925,10, Are You Happy Now?,"Out of all of the Pixar films I've seen, 'Inside Out' is still my favourite. It's an inventive exercise in psychology, philosophy, mental health and slice of life comedy drama while being original and exciting.
Eleven year old Riley Anderson had a happy childhood in Minnesota, until her parents sell their house and move to San Francisco. Her five emotions all struggle to cope. Joy, the leader of the emotions, who looks like Tinkerbell with Zach Callinson's hair, tries to keep Riley's mind balanced, but she represses Sadness in an attempt to stop Riley's day being ruined. What Joy doesn't know is that she's unintentionally hurting Riley in her efforts to give her happy memories.
This all builds up to the first day of school, where Riley breaks down in tears over her memories of Minnesota. As it happened, Sadness touched one of Riley's core memories and turned it blue. A fight breaks out and Joy and Sadness are trapped in Riley's subconscious. Now that Riley has surpressed her sadness, it came at the cost of her joy, too, and all that's left is pain, pain, pain.
The rest of the film consists of Joy and Sadness trying to get back to their headquarters, with Riley's old imaginary friend Bing Bong (Richard Kind), a smaller answer to 'Dexter's Laboratory's Koosalagoopagoop, as their guide, before Fear (who looks like a purple version of Lord Starchbottom from 'The 7D'), Anger and Disgust mess anything up. On the way, Joy learns that she can't change Sadness, and she doesn't need to.
The animation in Riley's mind is lively, fun and creative. The writing is sharp as a tack and very funny. It also teaches an important lesson to children, that it's okay to be sad and it's part of expressing feelings healthily. Conclusively, sad memories are nothing to be ashamed of, and don't get in the way of happy ones. It's a powerful, profound, entertaining film and is essential viewing.",

This movie isn't anything like Osmosis Jones because that didn't have emotions in it just a whole lot of rude and crude humor about what our body and our cells are doing.

It has your dreams along with your favorite childhood memories and imaginary friends that love to laugh and play with you whenever you're feeling way down in the dumps.

It is a film with several depths, and at the points where where I initially thought there were some mistakes, is put to shame in the last third of the film. The few things that make the film not get top grade are respectively the small mistake that happens when Riley leaves home, in relation to when the parents come home, and then I do not think that the feelings of disgust, anger and especially fear got their justification in the film.

People should definily go watch this film, it's better to watch it in childhood, but actually it gets better when you age up. My favourite part was every part of Ding Dong.",

They took an example of how the emotions work in the brain of a girl until her teenage years. It will teach you that every emotion is important, even sadness. Because it is OK to feel sad sometimes, get it all out. You have to have a balance. The fact that it is an animation movie does not mean its (only) for children. But I think that this can be a beautiful way to teach children (and everyone really) about emotions! I think it was about time that they dare to make a animation movie like this. With a deeper message. It is a big surprise to me that some people don't like it. Probably because they didn't expect an animation film to be this educated. ",

Riley's story can be relatable to many people in the world but the message and emotions she goes through is relatable to everyone. We all experience happy, sad, fearful, anger and distraughting moments constantly through our lives and Pixar truly delivers on this film by showing why it's important to have all those moments in life as they help us grow as an individual and learn valuable lessons. It's incredible to see Pixar deliver their powerful life lesson through such creative way, which is something that has been lacking in their recent films but Inside Out puts Pixar back on the top mark.",

Sure it's dark and moody and you witness the crumbling of an 11 year old girls personality quirks and interests, but the thing is that this movie does make sense when it comes to the emotions of a girl who had her life suddenly turned upside down and how she would have to deal with it. I do like the way this movie ends and the message it gives to whoever watches it, you're not alone. Is it completely scientifically accurate to how a preteen girl or boy thinks? no, but it is the most entertaining and interesting movie about how the mind and emotion works that I have seen in recent memory, are there other kids movies like this? maybe I've forgotten",
645,26 June 2015,cdip90,8, Inside Out: An interesting look on what if feelings had feelings?,"Pixar's latest film tells the story of Riley by showing us exactly what's inside her mind. There we meet Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, who operate ""Riley Headquarters"" and don't always agree. Joy is the voice of reason, always wanting to keep Riley happy, while the other feelings are repeatedly stepping on each other's toes to control Riley's emotional response. The banter between feelings will have you laughing out loud for most of the beginning of the movie. Everything in Riley's life is going great until her family decides to move. This move drives 11-year-old Riley into emotion overload, and we as the audience get to see this firsthand. Joy and Sadness are tossed into the deep recesses of Riley's mind, where the ""Alice in Wonderland"" type of fantasy is happening. The jokes are great, the story really interesting. The middle lags a bit, but overall, the movie is an interesting new take on a young girl's emotions.",

It is as appropriate for a child as it is for an adult. But maybe, adults can get to the very heart of the story like no child could. The plot is very good, simple yet deep; the art in this movie is superb (a scene in particular I will not explain to avoid spoilers got me crazy for the characters design); a couple moments in the movie are really worth your tears. And the whole movie, is really worth watching. It's Disney and Pixar making a step further in the art of story telling, it's a great idea going visual.

I just can't accept that many are saying that this is Pixar's best because it is far from it. The concept was quite impressive but it could have been executed way better. It was brilliant, yes, but not very heartwarming and unforgettable. The animation was okay but I didn't like Joy's look especially her blue hair because it wasn't very gleeful and she didn't shine among other emotions. What I didn't like most was Joy and Anger's journey back to headquarters because it seemed long and unending. I get the effort of capturing not only the children's heart but also the adults' but this is where they failed because the movie wasn't appealing to children but more on adults. Pixar forgot who their first priority should be because even though it looked like a kid's movie it was more directed to adults and that I think was a big problem because most parents only went to see this because of their children. Now, you may wonder why I still gave this an 8 because I sounded like I hate it but really it was better than Cars and Brave so it was deserving of an 8. And of course, it was made by Pixar so I am a bit bias. It has strong points but perhaps it was just overshadowed by my unmet 100-story expectation. Overall, I think Pixar was back on track the day MU was shown and this Inside Out was their bump along the way. I can't wait to see it again and who knows maybe this is all just a mistake and it truly deserves 11/10.",

Out of the many emotions we feel as humans, Pixar have picked the 5 that obviously we feel the most and have done a excellent job making the characters work together, having their own personalities which are all quite funny in their own way.

The first scene with the baby Riley was ""WOW""! I could feel the texture of the skin... I can't describe it any better... Many viewers didn't like the movie, 'cause it was too dark or sad for kids. Guys, Disney do that since always! Fireworks and colors for the kids and a portrait of the reality with criticism, noted by some more observant adult viewers. Mickey F*ckin' Mouse is an adult single man that have a relationship with an adult single woman... They are not married... AND IT WAS THE F*CKIN' 1930's! Walt Disney laughed at the moralism of his time! The characters... Well... I already said that I didn't like any of Riley's emotion... Maybe that was the idea... I think that Joy was not supposed to be the good guy... But it is pretty weird a figure so visually likable being a b*tch... She stole Disgust's spotlight! Disgust, Fear and Anger... I wanna a spin off with those three ONLY! You can call it Inside Out: Puberty! For me they were character much more interesting than Joy and Sadness... One of the most accurate swings of the movie, the moments that don't matter who you are or where you're from, the moments you will enjoy the most... When they show other minds...

To make a shallow comparison, Inside Out is like Adventure Time in that it can awaken that childlike wonder and joy that you might lose in your daily life, while still making you mull over incredibly deep concepts. I think this is a movie that both adults and kids can watch, that it doesn't just cater to the whims of children, but rather respects, in a very much Toy Story way, how a child's view of the movie might develop as they grow up.",

Pixar's brilliant minds also made the character Sad is really lovable. From smart jokes, to heartening scenes, she brings audiences waves and waves of laughter. Also to look forward to is the short movie Lava (Played before the movie) which is romantic and funny. Overall in total, Inside Out is one of my favourite movies and will be on the list for a very long time, it's creative, funny, sad and heartening!

664,1 July 2015,algrigg,9, Easily one of the best and most complex animated movies in a long time,"First off, the detractors of this film cannot seem to agree on their argument about why it is bad. ""It's too realistic, and therefore depressing..."" ""It's too UNrealistic, because it doesn't show a girl from a broken home or abusive parents..."" ""It's too heavy for kids and they won't get it..."" For what it is worth, this film is both entertaining AND fascinating. The depiction of Riley's brain is actually very well thought-out and digestible for young kids, and its complexities can be appreciated further by adults and older kids. It's very true that there are many jokes and plot points that will go well over the heads of young children, but the underlying message is wonderful and heartbreaking at the same time. Making a movie that is kid-centered and kid-targeted is very different than making a movie that is kid-friendly. Some of the most effective family movies of all time have significantly adult themes and plot points. Think about how ET, the first time you saw it, was likely a sob-fest (at least for a while), but ended up being a classic. Toy Story, while a bit more understandable for kids, deals with the crisis of not having an identity and finding a place for yourself. This movie is much the same, as it deals with the sad reality that childhood memories DO eventually go away, and growing up is a tough thing to do. But, on the other side, it leads to a more complex, more whole person. Again, this movie ended up affecting me more than I had expected or was even prepared for, and it made me reflect on my own growing up in a poignant way.",

This movie was very good, and actually one of my favorite Pixar films, which I was surprised about. The voice actors and actresses all played their emotion very well, and Anger was easily the funniest in my opinion.

It is a musical about a lonely volcano who is longing for someone to be with him. He is singing about how lonely he is while over time he slowly starts to drifts into the sea. Later on we run into a female volcano who is already at the bottom of the sea. She he hears his song and thinks it was meant for her. Soon after that, he finds himself at the bottom of the sea but he is sad because he is stuck behind her and that she can't see him (because volcanoes can't turn around, silly). She then erupts and sprouts back up from the sea and he is sad once again because he can't erupt and sprout back up with her. Eventually, he then erupts and comes back up from the bottom of the sea and conveniently (because it's a Disney movie) sprouts out right next to her and the animation makes it look like they are caressing. Oh, and of course they are both singing together and the song happens to be very corny and cheesy.",

Meet the emotions: Joy - a bubbly, talkative girl and a control freak. She's kinda' likeable, but is my least favourite character. She is in control of the Console, where they get Riley feeling. She tries to keep Sadness away from the console as she doesn't understand Sadness, nor sees the use of her. But she is quite okay with the other emotions - Disgust, Fear, and Anger - being at the console.
Fear - well, the name speaks for itself, doesn't it? Fear is a very nervous guy. A complete scaredy-cat. He is actually quite funny sometimes. He keeps Riley safe and cautious.
Anger - as Joy put it, this dude ""cares very deeply about things being fair."" Prone to 'blowing his top' (almost literally), he is so hilarious and does care and has a lot of soul. He is my personal favourite of the emotions.
Sadness - she is, well, very sad. Joy tries to keep her away from the console as she doesn't understand what she does and believes that Riley should be happy, not sad. Sadness, the rejected one out of the emotions, reads a lot of the Mind Manuals (that tells them how things work in Riley's mind and such). She is full of knowledge of Riley's mind, and actually quite a nice and likeable character.
Disgust - She basically keeps Riley from being poisoned. She controls the disgust aspect of Riley. Again, another likeable and hilarious character and probably the most sensible character - one who deals in realism. Sometimes.
Riley and her parents move to Minnesota. Things come to a head with Joy and Sadness when Sadness starts to touch Riley's memories, causing them to change to sad. On Riley's first day of school after they move, Sadness gets to the Console, causing the memory of that time - which was a very important memory, called a Core Memory - to be sad, and it's the very first one to be sad. Joy panics, and tries to get rid of that Core Memory, and ends up being sucked out of HeadQuarters with Sadness and all the other Core Memories. Now they have to try and get back to HQ as without the Core Memories, Riley starts to lose her personality and slips into depression.
The other emotions try to pretend to be Joy, but that fails miserably. As the other emotions try to navigate Riley through each day as they await Joy's and Sadness' return, Riley becomes distant and aloof, moody and ends up becoming apathetic. Joy learns some very important lessons, the main one being finally understanding Sadness' purpose. Can they make it back to HQ in time to restore Riley?
For a children's movie, this deals with very serious issues. It is very well-thought out and really gets you thinking. I could really relate to Riley. I consider it to be flawless. Absolutely perfect! A great script, great plot, awesome voices, and the issues dealt with are done in such a way that it is still entertaining for children. It is one of my favourite children movies and is an awesome animated movie. The climax is fantastic - it has a very emotional and desperate feel to it. Then again, the whole movie is one big emotional roller-coaster. The cast did a stellar job bringing the characters to life. The music score went very well with the movie.
A fantastic, and I mean utterly fantastic piece. If you haven't watched it, I would strongly urge you to watch it.",

Loved it!!! , and I am not a kid so can understand feel & relate with the message of Joy & Sadness, & going through the phase of anxiety and mixed emotions up to being completely numb from unexpected relocation to a completely new & unknown place. And while we can pretend every thing rosy for a school age child but real life doesn't works like that !

694,9 August 2015,ccanningevans,10, Words cannot describe how much I love this movie,"Okay, so this movie stars Riley and her emotions, Joy Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust and they have to deal with moving from Minnesota to San Francisco, but in her mind, something terrible has happened and Joy and Sadness were sucked up into long term memory, so now it's a race to get back to Head quarters (obvious pun is obvious), before Riley loses all of her personality traits and end up being an emotionless character you would find in an anime (i.e. Yuki Nagato). The moments I really liked from the movie, are Riley's emotions, I mean sure Joy and Sadness are okay, but I'm in love with Disgust, she's my favourite of the 5, even the imaginary friend, Joy and Sadness encounter on their journey was pretty hilarious and oh man the feels. Now, I may be a heartless bastard, but I never cried in this movie, maybe because that I cried so much years ago, or that I'm use to this kind of movie, anyway if there are people who will say that animation is only for kids, then watch this, this movie is one of the best things I've seen in years and they will have their own competition in November with The Good Dinosaur, well, join me there but for now, later.",

You get to look inside the mind of a young girl struggling with her family having to relocate to San Francisco for the father's job. Inside her mind are different characters that represent varying emotions. You sometimes get a glimpse into the mother and father's mind too, which make for a good laugh. Inside Out is an outstanding portrait of the human condition, what makes us tick, and how our emotions tend to play off of one another. The vocal talents of the cast gave sincere emotion to the characters. The plot and animation was perfect and kept me interested throughout the movie. The ideas of how the brain develops based on input and outside stimulus was brilliant. This was an all-around great movie that everyone should see and enjoy.",

This movie will not make you laugh, bu it'll make you cry and then it'll make you smile. Or at least that's what it has made me. I think the most important value of this movie is that it makes you feel connected. ""Inside out"" is not about extraordinary and unimaginable characters, it's just about a normal 11 year-old girl with her normal emotions. I can see myself in many ways watching this. And to me it's what makes this movie so great! Besides, the producer has made a very good job combining Riley's story with the emotions' one. The lessons are also cleverly hidden inside the movie. An extremely heart-moving and meaningful movie. I highly recommend it.",

Yes it is an animated film but that is what Pixar does best, or only. The peak into the human mind and seeing each emotion and watching as memories are created and stored is stellar screen writing. The emotions of Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear are given life as real characters who steer the young girl Riley, who's life we follow from birth to age 13. It takes great imagination to write a story like this and I applaud Pixar for this one. The scene where the parents are trying to deal with a very sad, angry Riley and the look at what is going on the their heads is downright hilarious. The fathers emotions should dealing with the situation at hand but instead they are all watching imaginary hockey. Bravo Pixar.",

This movie was instantly relatable, well paced, imaginary and left the audience with emotional thoughts afterwards. This movie is quite education, encouraging viewers not only to be self aware but to be aware of others, and understand that not everybody thinks and feels the same way. I would highly recommend people to watch this movie at least twice as a lot can be missed. This movie is quality cinema and taps into the emotion of the audience. This is not an ordinary kids movie with toilet humour and bright entertainment, it is a story so watch this movie with an open mind and be ready to have to explain aspects to your children.

703,12 July 2015,reviewsbycaleb,7, Surprising Dramatical heft with limited laughs,"Is a kid's movie that is incredibly moving and thought provoking still successful if its only mildly funny? Came into this one with pretty high expectations due to the eye-popping reviews and it was the first film I brought my niece and nephew too. If you have seen my top movies of 2014 lists, then it is apparent that I can really appreciate animated movies, with The Lego Movie being my #2 favorite movie of that year. Would Inside Out be this years Lego Movie? or the bigger question, would my niece Henley be able to sit through a whole movie? Inside Out is an inventive story that follows a young girl Riley and her emotions; Joy, Rage, Fear, Sadness, and Disgust. She is a seemingly happy girl with her family up in Minnesota and with Joy (Amy Poehler) at the controls of her emotions. There are bowling ball looking spheres that represent memories; gold for joy, green for disgust, red for anger, green for fear, and blue for sadness. With Joy leading the way of all the emotions, most of the spherical memories in Riley's mental inventory were a pure gold, including the core memories that helped create thematic islands that represent Riley's life. Then within a blink of an eye Riley gets uprooted from her life in Minnesota and moves to San Fransisco. All the emotions panic and Joy's joy is shaken for a split second for the first time before she gains composure and tries to put on a smile during a bad situation.",

I put off this movie for awhile, though everyone said it was great. And I finally go to watch it and it stresses me the f out! Like literally, it had me feeling all the emotions... It's not a bad Pixar film though... This movie makes you feel. If it didn't do that for you, well you mustn't have any core memories. Lol No Seriously rarely is there a movie that makes you feel as if you've grown as a person for watching it, so watch this movie .......my review is too short so I'll add that each emotion is clearly going to have its flaws AND strengths, that's the whole point of the film (tiny spoiler) joy thinking sadness would ruin everything but sadness was compelled to do what she did because she knew Riley needed to go through it, and joy didn't understand that having thought she needed to be happy all the time, by the end we see that's too stressful of a burden and that we all need to feel all the emotions.

I get that Pixar was trying to teach kids that feeling sad is okay, but if you really look at what's happening in this movie it's clear that this little girl is having a full mental collapse and entering full blown depression-with all her ""core memories"" being turned blue. Not feeling okay sometimes is okay, but this isn't exactly the message they were going for. Tye way Sadness is portrayed is that her being sad is somehow funny. Like ""oh isn't it funny that this character embodies depression and has to be dragged around by her foot because she's too overwhelmed with sadness to function?"" Also, what does it say about the parents when mom's driving emotion *is* sadness and dad's is anger? That's a scary suggestion that mom's depressed and dad has anger issues.",

I do think this is Pixar's most sophisticated movie, as there weren't as much slapstick as usual, and there were a lot of jokes that I found hilarious that didn't generate much laughter from the children in the theater.

On the other, it's what goes on in the mind of a child in the midst of life-shifting change.

Unimaginative? Depressing? I'm shocked and frankly disgusted with how one dimensional and shallow the general public seems to be. 'Inside Out' is not only one of the most visually beautiful animated films I've ever seen but I also feel that it's SO IMPORTANT for children to watch! The writers so expertly managed to fit the complexities of a child growing up and encountering situations and emotions they've never experienced before. Riley is struggling with adolescence and all the horrible awkwardness and sadness that goes along with losing the innocent simpleness of childhood. ,

A few thoughts: 1) We all have nearly impossible expectations for Pixar films. This one ""seems"" to have lived up to the old standards. There is something for everyone: slapstick action for kids, thoughtful dialog, and mature themes for adults to digest. Finally, tear-jerking moments for those who are affected by the Pixar emotion machine. In other words, this is far above ""Cars"" or ""Cars 2."" 2) It's not a original idea. This is basically animated ""Herman's Head"" which was a fun, little low-budget TV sitcom. 3) The first 30-40 minutes was pretty painful because the movie actually I had two beginnings: first was to introduce the humans, and the second was to introduce the emotions. I was bored. 4) However, the movie really began to ""move"" once Joy and Sadness got on the train for the first time. 5) The animation is awesome as usual.

737,29 June 2015,jreddavis,8," Wonderful Film With Some Hardcore Emotions, Certainly Worth Seeing","It should come as no surprise to any movie-goer that Pixar has created a film that takes a thought-provoking topic and presents them in a way that is both entertaining and emotional. Inside Out explores the idea that our actions are controlled by our emotions, which are determined based on the opinions of tiny, energy comprised characters in our heads. More than that, Inside Out looks into one of the most difficult points in a person's life: pre-pubescence. More accurately, it looks into what life is like at that transition when we are no longer children, but just starting to become the ball of uncontrollable emotions that is a teenager. Personally I found the film to be quite relate-able, and I think most can connect with it in some way. It looks at a time in life where we are all vulnerable, when emotions aren't as black and white as they used to be. Inside Out helps us recall that move, or that transition, that change that spurned a new era in our life, whatever that change or era might be. The animation is also visually stunning, with Pixar animating a world they have yet to explore, that being our own reality. However with such an expansive world, the animation can at times be spotty, although there were no noticeable imperfections within the mind of the main character Riley. Because Riley is an eleven year old girl, audience members over the age of 10 have a better chance of connecting with her story. That is perhaps the films greatest flaw, for most go into a Pixar movie (or most animated movies) assuming that it will be clean family fun that will entertain children of any age. While Inside Out is entertaining for most everyone and appropriate for all ages to see, the content is a little heavy and might go over some younger children's heads, especially because the story centers around a time in life when most are about 12. There are several slow parts in the movie and even with all the laughs, one does tend to walk out of the theater with a sense of melancholy rather than that of pure laughter. It's a wonderful film and brings many great emotions to life, both on screen and off, but if you're looking for simple family fun just to make your kids laugh, there are other options. Hold onto this movie though, and if you're the parent of a teenager than I guarantee this movie will make you cry. I know I did. All in all though I think that with this movie, Pixar has captured that old magic and put some new spins on their classic formula, making for a meaningful, heartfelt film.",

739,31 October 2015,ingridg-78226,10, I loved it.,This was a very touching movie. The movie portrays a young girl named Riley who moves to a whole new city. The characters in the movie are Riley's individual emotions who decide when and what she feels at a certain moment. Always being seen as a 'happy girl' by her parents because her joyous emotion is always in control. The joyful emotion doesn't like to see her sad so she doesn't let it happen often. Because of this her sadness emotion is lacking a lot and becomes out of control. A conflict happens cause both joy and sadness to loose control and become lost in her mind. The other 3 emotions are lost on what to do to take care of Riley in a city that's new to all of them. The frustration and confusing lead them to loose complete control of Riley's emotions until she finally lets out the sadness that has been held back. This touches me because I have been in situations where I'm expected to be happy and jolly but inside i just want to cry and take some time to just let those emotions out. I talk to someone i trust about how I'm feeling and let out a good cry to make myself feel better inside.,

Teens can relate just so much because they can be facing those kind of situations themselves as they grow and start to ""change"" not just moving away. Adults also can learn from that. I think adults can learn so much more than kids and teens because they've been through those things and they can learn from their mistakes and they also can teach their kids so much more many things in such an easier way.

Unlike some kids films these days, it never talks down to its audience. The characters are all very deep and interesting, and of course, the animation is fantastic.

It's a beautiful story in the most simple ways, but tackles ideas that are so complex and intertwined that I'm amazed the filmmakers were able to so perfectly find a balance. It's Pixar's most heartbreaking (Bing-Bong, the climax with Sadness...) and probably their most universally relatable.

But what spoilt it most of all for me is that there was no surprise - literally. The six basic emotions in psychology include surprise as well as the five represented here (happiness/joy, sadness, anger, fear and disgust). Without surprise, the poor girl in the movie can never be amazed, and will probably find it hard to 'get' most jokes if she can't feel surprised. Major plot-hole.",

755,12 July 2015,brookeymaree,10, Best children's movie in a long time.,"I did not think this movie would be as good as it was, to be honest. It is a perfect portrayal of basic psychology, of growing up and trying to make sense of our emotions. Those saying that the story writing was weak or that the characters were generalized, open your eyes. Riley is a ""typical"" mid western girl, with what seems a charmed life. Those asking for diversity, get over it. She is a generalized character. Its impossible to make a character that every single person will relate to 100%. No one is crying about Andy in ToyStory having an equally vanilla and privileged life. The reason Riley seems to have such a charmed life is because it shows a great contrast between feeling happy and ""normal"", to feeling how she does when joy and sadness go missing. It shows that no matter your situation, as good as it may be, everyone experiences different emotions. Even the ""happiest"" people feel sadness, fear, disgust and anger. Some people have said that those 5 emotions are not enough to represent how the mind actually works. Well obviously. Riley is only 11, that's the point. Her emotional intelligence is limited at this stage. Which is why at the end of the film we see that her memories can be mixtures of all emotions. That's the whole point!! It shows that emotions can be tied together and that what we feel can be complex and a mixture of many feelings. I believe this is a perfect demonstration of growing up, and a great way to describe how emotions work to an 11 year old. At such an age where hormones are running wild, she's growing up and encountering new life challenges. This is an extremely stressful time in ones life and can be very confusing. After the stress and embarrassment of moving to a new town, crying at school, hearing that your only friend has moved on already, feeling inadequate at the sport you love and feeling frustrated at your parents for moving her there. Its natural that these feelings are going to be represented by disgust, fear and anger. At times in life, it does feel like all joy and sadness have escaped us. Some say that Riley catching a bus to run away is unrealistic. How? Plenty of kids get the urge to run away. That's not a new concept. Its the logical conclusion for a kid who hadn't developed a great emotional understanding yet. Plenty of films have used the idea of running away. The scene of Riley getting on the bus to leave really makes you worried for her. Very powerful writing to immerse the viewer into the diageses. This movie shows that that is completely natural to feel emotions other than joy and that it shouldn't be shamed. Another comment questioned why Riley's parents emotions look like them but Riley's don't, perhaps its because her parents are more mature and have a sense of self as they are adults. They've already gone through what Riley's going through. Riley is only young, she hasn't figured out who she is yet, which is why her islands of personality change too. Also note that her mums Sadness is in charge and her dads Anger is in charge. Perhaps over time our emotions work out their hierarchy to define who we are, although Riley is ruled by joy now, as most children in her position would be, as they generally live in ignorant bliss and haven't grown up yet and don't understand their emotions yet, perhaps Riley will be ruled by sadness eventually, as we see joy let sadness have her place towards the end. This doesn't mean that she will be sad all the time, it just means she is aware of it. As they show in the end, you can have sadness and joy at the same time. I don't see why this is hard for people to understand.. Someone mentioned that Riley's dads emotions are just stupid and angry and not engaged, and that her mums just long for a life they didn't have and that they should both be more complex. No. This story is about Riley and her emotions, her parents are only thrown in for a funny scene. Same as the emotions at the end of the movie in the credit reel. Just for comedic effect but still showing that everyone else feels like we do too. Those saying that Bing Bong was an annoying unimaginative character- he was thought up by a three year old girl!! That's the point. He even says himself that he's mostly fairy floss and animal parts because that was all the rage at that age. He looks ridiculous because he's the figment of a toddlers imagination. I think people need to open their eyes and see what a masterpiece this film is. No other film has shown the process of growing up in such a clever way. And how could you not laugh at the ""facts and opinions get mixed up all the time"" line?? Probably the kind of people who think their opinions are fact.. The whole visual representation of the subconsciousness and the forgotten memories is extremely powerful. Bing Bongs passing, or being forgotten is a very significant metaphor, showing that we all grow up and move on, and that its all a part of life. Children need to understand that all of their emotions are valid. Many children's movies have adult themes, and Inside Out is no exception. Its a very mature concept, that it seems even a lot of adults are not grasping. Excellent film for lovers of the mind",

On an emotional level this movie hits a home run. Whether you are a kid or an adult this movie really hits home on the human experience, namely our emotions and what we are actually feeling and what makes us ourselves. Not that it's an hour and a half of constant crying or anything; it is also a funny movie, really funny. I think this is impart to the wonderful voice casting. As far as the story line goes it is pretty classic problem, climax, solution, but it's classic because it works. It's well written and keeps moving without rushing. ",
759,15 February 2020,Ryan_Barbakins,8, Heartbreakingly honest film.,"Inside Out is a film about the loss of one's childhood and happiness. Filtered through a innocent children's film, it limits itself from reaching true potential with this concept, yet it still contains many incredibly real themes. The biggest of which being Joy's arc of allowing sadness to take control. Anyone who is happy 100% of the time is either lying to them self, or a sociopath, and this film acknowledges this a couple times in heartfelt scenes.
The concept and world they built inside of a human brain is very broad and interesting. There is enough within it to where they could easily make a just as emotional sequel, yet I don't think they will end up doing this anytime soon.
Overall this is a very emotional and real film that may or may not make you cry.",

This has been one of the best animated movies that I have seen in a while. Contrary to what some reviews say, I believe that this movie is perfectly suitable for younger kids. People underestimate what kids can understand. I am a Pre-K teacher (teaching 3-4 year olds and some 5), and they understand that they have emotions and that their emotions make them feel different ways. In fact discussing emotions is one of the first lessons that we talk about, and almost everyday we talk about how each other is feeling for any particular day and how its okay for us to have emotions. Sure there where some parts in the movie that might be a little to complex for them to understand, but in reality when kids watch movies they hardly ever understand everything in the movie. For example, we watch The Lorax for a movie day at school, and I had to explain to the kids at the end about recycling and taking care of the earth why it's important and how it helps the earth, because most of them came away with a different understanding. But that's part of growing up and maturing, I can watch movies now that I watched when I was younger and get a completely different understand, because I know more now and I understand more. I don't think the previews did this movie justice at all. There where some depressing parts (I even teared up some), but the movie had a wonderful plot and story line. I would recommend this movie to anyone.",
767,13 November 2016,eswarnaveen,10, a brief note on its beauty,This movie tries to explain the psychological functioning of emotions in a person added with wide factors of entertainment and also produces a sense a philosophical thought. It can be called an informative yet attractive one. Especially the process of depicting emotions is very beautifully explained. Every part of the screenplay has been done with an utmost care and that reflects when we observe that although many situations are highlighted where entertainment was engaged but still the motive of the movie to rely on subject was not at all disturbed. i personally feel its a must watch for anyone as it help a lot in self understanding of our self and also gives a great scope for thought which we should focus on think about.,

770,3 August 2015,blaijonj,9, Wow...!,"I'd heard that Inside Out was 'good', but was surprised at how big a punch this little movie packs. Starting with the very few downsides; the narrative goes a little flat at least once during the movie, and the few characters there are, take slightly too long to warm up - but that's it...that's all I can draw from this film that is conceivably less than great. Everything else is just perfect. There's one pivotal scene (you'll know it when you get to it; about half-way in) when the emotional depth of the storyline really hits home. Everything had been building subtly to this point and all that ensues flows beautifully. For me, this is the point from which the movie makes perfect sense and holds your heartstrings tightly until the end. Congratulations to the screenwriters, artists, technical talent, director and entire production team - you've created a poignant, intricate and thoroughly satisfying story that visually pleases everyone (young children especially) and a narrative that will appeal to adults (parents especially). Thank-you.",
771,27 October 2015,sjspears-17141,8, One of the Greatest Movies of our Time,"Contrary to those who believe that Inside Out was a movie for ""12 year old girls"" or a complete disappointment or even Disney's worst production, I believe that Inside Out was an excellent movie in that its mastery of presenting real life topics (the role emotions play in our perception of memories throughout our lives) in such a way that children are able to grasp the ideas. Now before I continue I want to make it clear that while I am writing a positive review, I am NOT a mom or dad. There are many reasons as to why I believe that Inside Out was a success and not, as some would say, a failure. 1. While there are many other emotions besides anger, fear, disgust, joy, or sadness, the latter are the most common emotions present when we reflect upon memories. You wouldn't say ""Oh, that was a desirous memory or exciting memory"" you would be more likely to describe it as a happy or joyous memory. Also, if any one of the haters bothered to read the Trivia section about the movie, they would know that 27 other emotions were considered (surprise, trust, and pride were among those that were cut) but settled with joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and anger to make it less complicated for CHILDREN 2. This movie was made for kids. Thus, that is why there are no ""adult"" themes. However, to say there were no adult themes present would be saying that the idea of emotions, the occasional struggle to sort your emotions or memories, does not apply to adults which is simply not true because this notion applies to the young and old. 3. Inside Out presents the idea to young children that it is okay to express your emotions, that our memories will not always be joyous, but that they will not always be sad. Yes, there were some minor flaws within the movie, but to say that the writers and directors should be fired and never again be allowed to set foot on a PIXAR (this movie was a Disney PIXAR movie, not a Disney movie--they are two different things) set is ridiculous. Not every movie that Pixar has made has been a success. Every production company is bound to experience failures, that's how we learn what does and doesn't work, but in order to succeed one needs to take risks. And those who believe Inside Out to have been a complete failure need a wake up call because that's what this movie was..a risk. It was a movie that explored themes, topics, and issues that no other Disney or Disney Pixar movie had dared to do. And to compare it to Pixar's many other movies would be unjust and unfair not only to Inside Out, but to those other movies because each movie is its own, with different themes, and different topics.",

However, Pixar has been falling behind the progress that Disney Animation Studios has been making as of late, and I was wondering if they had run out of the fresh, thought- provoking ideas that have consistently made their films so memorable. I can't believe I'm saying this, but Inside Out might the best film Pixar has ever made. And if it's not, it's definitely among their best films for sure.",

792,28 June 2015,vimosh87,9, brilliant concept which makes u think abt how u think!!,"These days the term ""Out of the box"" has been used or rather abused so much that its original meaning seems incoherent.Thankfully Inside Out restores that classical meaning..A simple story of a girl who moves away with her family from the town she loved(Minniesota)has been layered brilliantly with the mechanism of emotional activity that takes place inside the brain.The different characters are good but my fav was Anger.Animation was truly rich n so was the creativity.The only problem were the dialogues ,which at times were not engaging,humor was a bit less .Also the importance of all the emotions was not shown.coz each one has its pluses..may be in the sequel they will show. But having said ,thumbs up to Pixar yet again for going for a brilliant concept..hope it gets better in part 2( fingers crossed)",
793,9 March 2021,kumaresanvishnu,9, A must watch for all!,This film has great messages for people of all ages(mostly children) and I think that families should watch this movie as this is a fantastic movie and it's also very creative. Pixar as usual comes up with many creative stories to tell and this was definitely one of them and thisovie is definitely one of my most favourite Pixar film.I highly recommend to everyone.,
794,5 August 2015,Cjalln1,8, A surprisingly clever children's film aimed more at adults than kids,"A foundation on fairly deep themes (reactions caused by different emotions, the difficult of moving across the country, growing up) and plenty of more grown-up jokes make ""Inside Out"" a successful film in its own right. Bizarrely, where it falls down is its accessibility to children. Riley's age (11) and the everyday situations she experiences should make her story relatable, yet the introspective focus on her emotions' decision-making turns the film into a more profound reflection on human nature. Pixar have developed a reputation as a thoughtful alternative to Disney animation; debatably this is the first occasion of their parent-friendly children's films which will be more favoured by adults than youngsters. Don't get me wrong - ""Inside Out"" is a very well-thought-out, cleverly crafted and enjoyable film, it's just that it may go over the heads of the majority of the target audience.",
795,19 August 2015,charorcu,9, Smart & fun way to picture the human mind,"Fantastic movie to make children and adults aware of the many things that go on inside the mind and how it relates to behavior. It was quite daring to try represent the human mind with all its complexities. Although they made a great job, easy for children and non- expert adults, they missed very fundamental areas of the mind as executive control and volition, including our capacity to regulate emotions!... They might have left it for a possible second part, but this capacity grows from much earlier than the age of Riley in the actual movie. In any case, is a must see movie, funny and smart, certainly provoking many trains of thoughts!! ;)",
796,8 October 2015,wdngo,9, Awesome,"With the recent Pixar movies, it seems to me that they are putting more effort on trying to intrigue all ages not just only children anymore. This movie is about a young girl moving into a new city as her emotions navigate her decisions. One emotion which is Joy get into a conflict and is in search of a solution but while she is on this journey she learns a lot about Sadness and her part in the young girl life. As she evolves on this journey, as do the other emotions and the young girl. First off, the images and sound play a huge part in this movie as it adds all the emotions needed in the pictures. It gives us a different perspective in how our emotions bleed out to others and how creative we forget we can be. The director does well in this part as he gives different scenes that are out of this world mostly on Joy journey as you would not expect most of the stuff happening seeing greed, selfishness, and others which you wouldn't presume to happen in a ""young movie."" He gives you a different picture on life and how generally our society forgets how we could view it from all different sides. The director also actively engages the audience as Joy goes on a journey to rescue the girls Morals or Personality that she obtain throughout her life. Certainly A movie that made me tear up is a first as it is hard for a guy to cry sometimes. What could have been worked on is the music as it should really amplify more of the scene rather than a little aggression. Some felt like it was lackluster as it was a powerful scene. As for the voices of each character, I believe it was splendid as Angry had the right tone of voice and sarcasm. Disgust had this almost blonde personality but what really gave in was Bing Bong played by Richard King, he put so much emotion and thought in his voice that it felt so real in the movies. The usage of colors allows more eye candy in the different section of the movies that appealed to the audience giving them not a monotone view but at time vibrant for happy feeling and same suit color for sadness. Overall this movie 9/10 as there is some part that are a little off but the plot, character, and voices were on point. Other than that the movie is about 1 hour and 30mins giving it a perfect time for the plot to end, nothing I felt was rushed as everything flowed nicely. This movie oddly relates a lot to our daily lives as our emotions get in a way with a lot of our decision-making comprising some paths that we choose but also how we deal with other people in our daily lives. Our choices and voice make big decision in other views as working with others to make a better place.",

But they pulled it off and it was amazing! i loved joy, and bing bong. this was a perfect addition to the Pixar collection. this movie made me laugh and cry and really think about psychology. what i thought was extremely interesting about this movie is when they're sitting at the table (it was in the previews for it) and at the end during the credits, that when they went into other peoples heads, they had different emotions in charge, for example the mom had sadness in charge, Riley has joy in charge and her father had anger in charge. it made me really think about what my leader would be. another thing i loved were the personality islands and i really wish i could see everyone that i knew! all I'm saying is this movie is very fun, accurate, lovable and probably my second favorite Pixar movie, replacing finding Nemo and following my first favorite monsters inc.",

The movie is funny and quite sad at some points. Its a feel good family movie that adults can enjoy with their children. The voices go with each character as well as the different moods. Pixar has stepped up their game with this one it is up there with toy story and up. I recommend you see this movie it is fun for children as well as adults.

The film also does an incredible job of world-building, so much so that one wonders if the film is too complicated for kids, although the gigantic box office would seem to indicate otherwise. Fully deserving of its critical and financial success, this ranks with the very best of Pixar.

810,27 November 2020,samhendersonthemovieman,10, The best Pixar movie since WALL-E and Toy Story!,"Okay, so I'm a huge fan of Pixar, especially when I was a kid. It's my favorite animation studio. It made tons a great family animated movies like the Toy Story series, WALL-E, Inside Out, The Incredibles, Up, Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., Coco, and Ratatouille. It also made some movies that are enjoyable but not great like the Cars series, Monsters University, Brave, and The Good Dinosaur. Pixar is also worthy for any age honestly. Anyways, Inside Out is fantastic! The animation is really stunning and colorful to look at. The concept and story is really imaginative and makes you imagine what your mind looks like inside and what your emotions would do to you. The music by Michael Giacchino is very nice to listen and great. The voice acting is really good, especially from Amy Koehler, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, and Richard Kind. The themes about life is very powerful. The humor is very funny, especially with the scenes involving Anger. The screenplay is very well written and smart as well. For me, Inside Out equals Toy Story and WALL-E as the best Pixar movie and the best animated movie of all time! I watched it a bunch of times and never grew tired of it, especially on vacations. It's a lot of fun and worth watching for everyone!",

818,9 December 2015,IsaacSage,8, 4.25/5,"Pixar's bread and butter has been making animated films for kids AND adults. Sure, other studios have followed sit, and nowadays most adults can get enjoyment out of most kids films. However, Pixar is something different. I can't really cover what exactly that is, but just look at the opening credits of Up. Just look at basically all of Finding Nemo. But they've been in a bit of a dry spell. The Cars films are basically commercials for a theme park, Brave tried something different but failed, and Monsters University...well to be honest I can't even remember Monsters University. But now Inside Out is here, which takes us inside the mind of a young girl named Riley, who has just left her friends behind to move to San Francisco with her parents. When she's there, she has difficulty making new friends, and her parents are dealing with some money troubles. We see things however, from the perspective of the four emotions that dominate the ""control center"" inside her head. Joy(Amy Poehler) Sadness(Phyllis Smith) Anger(Lewis Black) Disgust(Mindy Kaling) and Fear(Bill Hader.) Joy is a little compulsive about Riley's memories, and soon she and sadness are sucked out of headquarters and into the big bad wilderness of a little girl's mind. The first thing that hit me about this film was how damn creative it was. Imagination, dreams and nightmares, imaginary friends, and the train of thought are all handled with an amazing amount of brilliance that most films lack. The voice-acting is all great, definitely on the funny and light side at the beginning, but when the hard-hitting emotional beats of the film hit, they hit extremely hard. The film's message is perhaps the most refreshing thing about it. I'm not going to spoil it, but it's unlike anything any kids film has taught us before, and the film's finale is one of the most heartwarming moments I've seen this year. Inside Out isn't perfect however. It's just under two hours, and the middle does get quite repetitive. Kids will no doubt enjoy the color on display, but it does get a bit tiresome. That's about the only criticism I have, besides the fact that the film doesn't feel as Magical as Finding Nemo or Up. I'm not quite sure why that is, but with Pixar, when the whole movie jells it creates a truly special experience. However when it doesn't, it is at least noticeable. This last thing is not a criticism or praise but a question. How do kids react to this film? It's funny and colorful, but will many of the jokes be lost on them? This is the first pixar film that is equally for adults as it is kids. Honestly, as many adults can learn from this film as kids. It's directed by Pete Doctor, and while it's not quite the first 15 minutes of Up, it is pretty damn close.",
819,3 January 2022,scrunkly,9, This is a cinematic masterpiece,"Wow!!!! I love this m movie! It is very different to most movies (that is a good thing!!?).

It might be too insane and wild and crazy for people over or under. If I had to say one bad factor, I would say that the side characters don't get enough screen time, Besides that, this is a masterpiece.",
820,11 August 2015,yllota,9, Delicious!,"I saw a trailer for this movie months ago and loved the idea - if only they could make it work - said my fear ;) I finally got to watch it today and they totally made it work, this movie is everything I hoped it would be. Very funny for adults and kids alike, smart and kind of ""scientifically accurate"" in a metaphorical way - all of this with that touch of Disney magic, that golden dust they shine on simple stories to make them special. I read some reviews saying this is probably more of a family centered but adult oriented movie, with hints for kids and not the other way around and I must say I don't agree. Although the big picture may only be totally grasped by grownups I feel like it still makes sense for kids and gives them valuable tools to accept and understand their own emotions as well as other's. I find it awesome that in a world where more and more kids live isolated behind screens the animation industry is striving to make everyone feel included and to explain more abstract and social concepts earlier and in more explicit ways. If you like that idea or have a kid who could benefit from this kind of approach I also recommend the movie Home, with the cute purple aliens.",

I imagine the people or (or lowlife with too much time and too many fake accounts) that try to shoot down this film, they probably have been seriously triggered in some way, on a deep emotional level. Do you think you should be happy 24/7? Do you think sadness has no value? Do you not believe in scientific concepts (the brain, emotion, memory, neuroscience) which are in abundance in the film?

Was impressed with the thought that went into the plot and the messages. Very touching movie as you relate the way the motions are played and you think how one relates with family and friends in your life and as you grew up. For me, I kept thinking about how I communicate with my 84 year old mom who is quite stubborn but in need of a lot of support. Quality production with excellent animation (was also impressed with Minions animation). So not every movie can be everything and this movie was typically high quality Pixar message. Minions was just a fun romp. I recommend both highly in their own realm of animated movies. While I did very much enjoy Penguins of Madagascar, especially the second time I saw it, and loved many of their shorts as being really creative fun, I would say that Minions was a bit more entertaining as a spin-off movie than Penguins. So, if you really liked Penguins, I would think you would at least enjoy Minions as much. For me, I just want to be entertained for 90 to 250 minutes and catch a movie or two Saturday mornings to wind down from the work week and don't mind soft-pedaled messages mixed in with a lot of fun.",

Inside Out is not just the best in the last few years, but it will without a doubt stand alongside the best of the best the studio has to offer. It's a really tough thing to rank Pixar, because they have had such stellar track record, and so it really boils down to which animated masterpiece is your favorite. Do you love the nostalgia of the original Toy Story, or how about how Finding Nemo swept us away? We can argue The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E and Up are the best that Pixar has to offer...Inside Out is going to further complicate that favorite status for a lot of people.",
843,17 October 2019,dostan-85075,9, Opinion & Review (Tumara),"I was really excited when I first saw trailer for that movie. Colorful characters got my attention and I was ready to watch it in Local Cinema. Main characters' casts are Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling, Ivana Wong as the emotions and Kaitlyn Dias as Riley.
Story starts from Riley's early ages of chilhood and how her emotions inside her head started their work. Complexity of emotions' work is explained and shown while main character, little and happy girl, is growing. Riley is rose by very responsible and good parents, but then some problems appear as she becomes a teenager. It is widely known that teenagers have complex mind and that movie shows how Riley is going through this time.
The movie itself is good directed and is full of colors. Every detail about chararistics is well-developed and clearly shown. Not only do people have emotions, but characters known as Emotions also do. Effects and backround sounds appeal viewers who loves to watch something with 'happy end'.
Movie is appropriate to watch with Family or alone - movie makes to feel warm feelings and helps to relax and fully penetrate to the reality of ""Inside Out"".",

The last good Pixar movie(in my opinion) came out in 2010 with Toy Story 3. Not saying that Brave or Monsters University aren't good. They are just not Pixar classics in my eyes. Unlike Inside Out which is an instant Pixar classic that stands up there with the greats. Inside Out is filled with emotion, creativity, and memorable characters that you can only find in the best of Pixar's films. I even got a little teary eyed and several parts of the film. The last time that happened it was during the beginning sequence of Up. So do yourself a favor and watch this movie. I 100% guarantee that you will not be disappointed.",

I wish this movie existed when I was a teenage girl dealing with the same emotions. It was an excellent movie and I loved all the characters. We especially loved the character of Bing Bong, the long lost, imaginary friend. He played such a crucial role in bringing Joy and Sadness back to headquarters! The whole idea that a change in circumstance can change the outcome of a memory really made me think about my own experiences as a child. I think this movie brought to life so many emotions in myself that I just loved every minute of it. I know I will watch it over and over again and look forward to sharing it with my own kids some day.",

The movie combined so many element together and doing this in a splendid way. We all know that when a baby first come to the new world the baby is always crying, but as we saw, Riley came to this world with the first emotion, joy,I like this cause I just felt that it's great to come to the world,but then sadness comes and makes me cry. That's why baby is crying. And when we were younger,our feelings and emotions toward a thing is much more clear,happy or sad or angry or disgust or scare,but when we grow older,the feelings and emotions became complex,we are not just happy or sad or angry or disgust or scare toward something but more like to be some feelings or emotions combined together,because we are getting older and the feelings won't be clear as the old times,that's what grow told us. The trailer is so fun it told us about the people Riley met and how the 5 emotions in their head controls them,but psychologically we know that emotion is not can be simply divided into five but is far more bigger than this amount, but the five in the movie is fine enough to explain all the things. Thought train won't work when we were sleeping,the clown is so scared, dream was actually made by the people in our head and cloud town,all of this is so fun. And lastly, we all once had a bingbong in our head, but after we grow up we just left bingbong behind our memory.",

My girlfriend had persuaded me to see it after she saw it a few weeks prior, so I obliged. I had seen the reviews by the critics of the movie so I expected it to be a well made movie, but not something I would get so much enjoyment out of. Several times throughout the film we were both laughing our butts off. Not only were some of the scenes humorous, but they were also really clever in how people really think. The movie's main characters are based on different human emotions, and how they respond to real life situations. It is very interesting to see how each reacts to every situation that comes up during the life of the main girl in the story. I think the makers of the movie did a great job bringing a unique aspect to a story that I hadn't seen done before. Overall it is a great movie for all ages, and if someone you know wants you to see it with them, don't hesitate and you may get a few great laughs that you didn't expect. I give it an 8/10, based on the fact that it would still appeal to a younger audience more, and for re-watch value.",

I can't and I never will. This film is based on a not so every day struggle of a little girl having to go through leaving her friends and home town to a new city across country. Her parents are trying to make the best of it but things just aren't going their way. The girl, Riley, has five main emotions: joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust (The emotions are portrayed as humanoid characters). They run into trouble resulting in losing what are called Riley's ""core memories"" in her mind and need to find them immediately. However, joy and sadness get separated and need to find the core memories and get them back to the main HQ of Riley's mind. With Joy and Sadness gone, the other emotions frantically try to work Riley through every day life while Joy and Sadness are absent. They end up making things even worse for Riley and drive Riley to running away from home. Joy and Sadness find the core memories and make the journey back to HQ and restore Riley's happiness and sadness which compel her to run home to her worried parents. In the long run, the emotions grow stronger and realize each one of them is important to Riley's every day thoughts and emotions, even sadness. ",

Or it's the exciting and at times grotesque ( especially in Toy story 2) world of toys and perhaps it's a garbage collecting robot left alone on Earth who ignites love in a terminator. In his Golden Globe( and most probably Oscar) winning movie he has chosen human's emotions as his characters. There are four: Joy, Sadness, Anger and Disgust. But the movie is not about emotions. The major theme of this animation is actually growing up.

I've been watching movies for quite a long time now, but i finally decided to start reviewing them, and not only rating them. This movie is something I haven't seen before. It surprised me right off the start. The idea of emotions portrayed in this way and the way the showed a few scenes, it just blew my mind, especially when you compare your life experiences to first scenes in this movie. Inside Out surely isn't flawless, and my rating (7/10) is definitely not high, and that's because the movie started out great, and when it got to half of the movie, it went down slowly when it reached the point that I was actually getting annoyed (More or less when the protagonist fell into the pit)- Hope this is not a spoiler. What's great though is that from there the movie just accelerated as if it wanted to go back on its track. And that I loved. It was a great ending (Which in my opinion also opens to a second movie), great voice over(s) and I only gave this rating because I wouldn't want to watch this movie twice.

They are emotions of the kid Riley, and they work in her brain to keep her balanced. Once Joy and Sadness were unbalanced during her childhood, Sadness did not find itself useful and naturally started a sequence of mess in her head. As an effect, she was thrown with Joy out of the ""control zone"" towards the mazes of memories and personalities islands. The moment that everything happened was one of the most scary moments of our childhood: the moment you enter in a new school.(Genial script!) So, this is not a movie about the kid Riley. Her personality had been constructed and destroyed and then reconstructed all during the piece and again, this is not a movie about her. Instead of that, this piece is about her emotions and how they are connected with each other in the construction of her personality. And how sometimes, Sadness needs to take control.

OK, I know this idea of living emotions has been done to death one too many times, there were some perceptions that were decent, others were not as good, but Inside Out managed to pull it off perfectly! This film taught me that originality doesn't always matter, but rather how good you manage to percept the idea. The film also is a good film to watch for all ages, of course, younger children may not be able to understand the concept, but older kids, teens, and adults can get laughs and a few tear-jerkers from this movie. If anything, the plot of Riley moving to San Francisco fits the situation of Sadness being needed all along perfectly.

890,25 June 2015,vohnrocks,9, Pixar film is a complex and funny ride!,"Joy, sadness, anger, disgust and fear: These are emotions we all experience as human beings. And once again, Pixar has chosen something that is relatively mundane, and turn them into a touching story involving colorful, adorable, and complex characters. Inside out is quintessential Pixar material: technically impressive and most importantly, human. The story is about different human emotions, personified through tangible characters, EXISTING inside a little girl's mind. Every memory that Haley experiences is stored in a ball, and the most important memories are called core memories, which are stored in a special section of Haley's brain. At first, the movie focuses on Joy's ability to bring Haley out of sad situations, such as her move away from her friends. On the other hand, Sadness always seems to bring Haley down by making her world a bit more DEPRESSING. From the get go, the audience can see a stark contrast between Joy and Sadness: As one seems to be in control and making Haley's life manageable, the other takes the back seat and occasionally chimes in to make Haley's life a little bit more depressing. After an accident, Joy and Sadness are trapped in Long term Memory, With Joy being gone, Haley's emotions become much more unpredictable. At the same time, Sadness's role becomes increasingly important as the story progresses, Sadness was able to calm Haley's Imaginary friend down and in addition, brought Haley's parents to comfort her, turning her sad memory into a joyful one. I think through the use of Joy and Sadness, Pixar wants to embrace the sadness that most of us have experienced in our lives. Many joyful moments are a result of the sadness that precedes them. For example, Haley was sad because she lost her game, her family didn't want her to be alone so they came and supported her. I think the idea of emotions as being complex, not black and white, is such an cool idea. It makes us appreciate the times that we are lonely and depressed. Being a psychology student, I also picked up a lot of psychology references in the movie. For example, balls of memories getting sucked into long term memory is not far off from the real PROCESS where daily memories are converted into long term memory during sleep. In addition, the portrayal of the subconscious as the place that stores all of our deepest fears are quite Freudian, the island of personality that is driven by core memories is similar to the psychological idea that our personalities are made up important interactions with our environments. One moment that I thought was very intriguing was when Haley lost all emotions and became numb. Her face was blank, she no longer cared about what was happening around her. To me, this moment showed that some individuals have gone through so much hardship that their emotions, which often function to as a device to warn them against danger, help them survive and fit into society, have been broken. It's almost as if their internal compasses are broken and they are unable to tell what's good and what's not good for them. Fortunately, Haley was able to regain her emotions and in the final moments, her memory balls are a mixture of emotions: Sadness and joy, anger and disgust, now interconnected, and her personality became more complex. The world of emotions is neither is black or white, but rather a mixture, diverse blend. GO PIXAR!!",

I think most of the people who wrote the negative reviews didn't understand the premise or concept. She wasn't depressed, she was sad about moving. There is a definite difference between the two. Her reaction to moving was a very real one. She didn't want to make her parents feel bad about moving so she hid her emotions. That's a very real concept and whether we realize it or not our kids care and worry like we do. And will sometimes not share their feelings for fear of hurting ours. Great movie. Watch it with an open mind.",
