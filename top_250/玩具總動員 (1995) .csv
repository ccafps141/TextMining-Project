The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer.  The animation is extraordinary in it's ability to bring such great entertainment to the screen.  The film also teaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly between Woody and Buzz Light-year).  Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come with.",v

No film has yet come close to Toy Story in legitimizing animation as a film art on the level of movies with live actors.

6,20 April 2001,Anonymous_Maxine,10, Best Disney film. Ever.,"Toy Story is not only the best Disney film because it has the best story and the best animation, but also because of the excellent actors chosen to provide the voices of the animals. The casting was perfect from top to bottom, and the movie provides an excellent adventure story about friendship and loyalty that keeps you engrossed until the nail-biting climax.",w
7,3 January 2015,Hitchcoc,10, As Good as It Gets!,"What a wonderful integration of classic toys and a superb plot. It's a new height in animation (though things have gotten even more impressive long since). The voicings of Tim Allen as Buzz and Tom Hanks as Woody, with their inherent connection to their toy beings, with an incredible supporting cast, make this a romp to end all romps. There is a strain between the realities of the world and the fact that even though they are sentient beings, they are still toys. Buzz has lights that flash but he can't really fly. Woody has the ludicrous string on his back that allows him to deliver his catch phrases. Then there is the neighborhood villain, Sid, who is a maimer and destroyer of toys. There is the quest for the mishandled and lost. And a finale that is worthy of everything that has been set up. What really makes this work is the ""humanity"" of the characters. There is love and a true connection among them. If you have never seen this, it is worth every minute.",/

9,30 December 2005,SmileysWorld,9," Proof that Pixar not only cares about the quality of their work,they care about our kids.","Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library.",w
10,13 December 2010,gigan-92,10, my Personal Favorite of Pixar's Work,"I remember seeing this film at the ripe age of seven, and I was totally entranced by it. What kid would not have been attracted to that sweet of a premise? Released way back in 1999, it was totally different from the usual hand drawn animation, and yet still as vibrant, if not more so. Even now as an 18 year old dude I find it so amazing. Attention to detail has always been Lasseter's strong suit, among many I might add. But the greatest thing about this film was the life evoked into its unique and untouchable characters.",4

12,6 September 2005,dee.reid,10," ""Toy Story"" - The Toys are in town and something more","I'm 19, going on 20 in six days. I don't need to tell you that ""Toy Story"" is a movie tailor-made for the kiddies, but there's a special reservation for adults too. I should know, as should anyone who views it with an open mind. We've all had our favorite toys. For guys, like me, there's a 90% chance you played with either Transformers or G.I. Joe or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or all three when you were six, seven, eight, or nine years-old. For me, it was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Godzilla action figures. I'd always imagine living out wild fantasy adventures in my room or basement; ah, the joy of being a kid again. But that's part of ""Toy Story's"" fun appeal. It gives you a chance to relive your childhood again. Today I saw for the first time in about eight years and it's still just as fresh and inventive as Pixar, probably the best film studio in computer animation, conceived it back in 1995. In the room of young Andy, the toys are alive - when he's not present of course, and cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is the boy's favorite item. But all that changes on Andy's birthday and a new toy given to him on that day captures the boy's heart - Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen). Of course, any replacement of this sort inspires jealousy, and pretty soon Buzz is the new ""it"" item of the bedroom. Andy's given into everything Buzz Lightyear, even new bedsheets - bedsheets! - leaving poor Woody on the short end of the stick. But the thing is, Buzz has trouble believing he's just a simple toy and nothing more, as he thinks he's actually BUZZ LIGHTYEAR! It also seems this couldn't have come at a worse time for the toys, as Andy and his mother are moving away, which is causing all sorts of chaos as Woody tries to get everything organized so nobody is left behind, and that's exactly what happens with rivals Woody and Buzz, who are misplaced and must find their beloved Andy before they move. Not only that, they must also battle Sid, the serial killer in-training kid that lives next door and tortures toys. As directed by John Lasseter and his army of screenwriters including himself, Andrew Stanton (who would co-direct Pixar's future hit ""Finding Nemo"" in 2003) and Joel Cohen, ""Toy Story"" is true imaginative fantasy realized in superb animation. It more than brings the kid in you to the surface, it makes you want to be a kid again, as many toys have cameos including Army Men (including the Sergeant who's voiced by R. Lee Ermey) and Mr. Potato Head (voiced by Don Rickles). I love ""Toy Story,"" and I think anyone who views it thoughtfully will love it too.",2
13,15 January 2015,ofpsmith,10, Pixar's first feature.,"The first feature length Pixar film and the first feature film to be made entirely in computer animated imagery Toy Story was a milestone in film history. But apart from it's massive impact, Toy Story is still a really great film. The toys in the bedroom of Andy Davis (John Morris) are alive (when Andy doesn't look) and seem to have their own community set up. The most popular toy being Andy's favorite toy, a toy cowboy named Woody (Tom Hanks). But that might change this birthday when Andy get's a new toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) a toy spaceman who still thinks that he's a real spaceman. To add on to that Woody takes an immediate disliking to Buzz because Andy seems to play with him more now and all the other toys go the same route. Well Woody and Buzz inadvertently end up in the house of Sid Phillips (Erik Von Detten) the destructive next door neighbor who is pretty much the type of person that would put a turtle on it's shell for fun. So Woody and Buzz have to overcome their differences and get back to Andy's house before he moves. This film's story is great and intriguing. The comedy here is also great. The dialog between Woody and Buzz is very funny. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. It's the birthplace of Pixar who over the years have proved themselves worthy of the praise given by adults and children alike.",8
14,3 February 2009,alexkolokotronis,10, Every Kid's Fantasy,"Toy Story is the film that started Pixar Animated Studios into its long string of never ending success. What Pixar does is not just absorb the younger demographic and keep the older ones mildly entertained. It completely absorbs everyone watching no matter the age or the level of maturity, films of Pixar, starting from Toy Story, have kept a certain magical touch around it with an unexpected amount of depth. Everyone as a child imagines their toys will come alive and go on their own adventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does not attract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather with its material. The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting for animated films as there is to a live-action one. As a result of this Pixar stays faithful to its material and creates a great genuine and warm feeling around the film and its characters.",1
15,16 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10, Best Pixar movie to date!,"Toy Story is just a wonderful film, that I recommend to anyone who loves animation. I will also say that it is definitely the best Pixar movie to date, all of which are extremely good, even the weaker efforts Cars and the Incredibles are well worth watching. I loved the voice talents, the talented Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody, and Tim Allen likewise as Buzz. Both characters are hugely engaging thanks to their frequent conflicts, and are well supported by excellent supporting characters like Potato Head, Rex, Ham and Little Bo Beep, voiced by the likes of Don Rickles, Jim Varney, John Ratzenberger and Annie Potts. Not to mention the hilarious toy aliens, and the creepy kid Sid. The voice talents aren't the only things worth mentioning, the film has a remarkable story and a truly irreverent script (""I'm from Mattel, actually I'm from a smaller company that was purchased by Mattel in a leveraged buyout""). But the best aspect of the movie is the phenomenal animation, which was colourful and sophisticated with brilliant character movement. Honestly, I loved this movie, and I also thought the sequel is one of the few sequels of recent times, that actually manages to surpass its predecessor. All in all, a wonderful film, that is a must-see for the whole family. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",3

17,28 December 2020,CubsandCulture,9, Even after 25 years this is still a magical film,"I re-watched this for the first time in about 15 years and it still holds up remarkably well. The animation is still very expressive at capturing character, tone and making a believable world unto itself. Pixar would go on to create more polished films but this one has all the hallmarks of the company. The story is enjoyable for children and if parents squint they can see a metaphor in employment turnover. (Not to mention the cultural transition from westerns to sci-fi, or the meta irony of 2d cell animation being supplanted by CGI). The film is equal parts charming, funny and exciting. It even tugs at the heartstrings not matter how cynical you are. It is far from Pixar's best but it holds its own in the pantheon of animated films.",/
18,1 July 2005,jboothmillard,10, Toy Story,"This was the very first computer animated film from Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation, it is just excellent. It is showing what happens when the young Andy leaves his room, his toys come to life! Woody the cowboy is Andy's favourite toy, and looks after all the other toys (and he is a very good Tom Hanks voicing). Unfortunately on Andy's early birthday party he gets a new favourite toy, Buzz Lightyear the space ranger (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody obviously gets jealous and both him and Buzz end up lost, and then in evil Sid's room. For a kid, Sid is a good villain. Woody and Buzz are now trying to find a way to get back to their owner. Also starring Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Jim Varney as Slinky, Annie Potts as Bo Peep, John Morris as Andy, Scream 2's Laurie Metcalf as Andy's Mom, Full Metal Jacket's R. Lee Ermey as Army Sarge and Jeff Pidgeon as Green Aliens.With recognisable toys for every generation, and the Oscar and Golden Globe nominated song ""You've Got a Friend"" and Oscar nominated music by Randy Newman, this is a great family film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and a Special Achievement Award (fior creation of a feature-length computer-animated film), it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, along with the sequel, both was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons, and it was number 40 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!",?

21,10 November 2005,Lady_Targaryen,8, One of the first animations from Pixar,"When Toy Story came, in 1995,I was 9 years old and it was a remarkable animation;Pixar wasn't famous like today, and we didn't have movies like Shrek and Finding Nemo. But I have to say that even in the present days this movie is awesome and has great graphics. Only to start, the story: The toys have life of their own, and every time we humans are distant from them, they have their lives and their own plans. Woody, until Buzz LightYear comes up,was Andy's favorite toy and also the leader of all of them. Jealous of Buzz's fame, Woody tries to get a rid of him, and because of that is totally ignored by the others toys, who once were his friends and admired him. Looking what he did, Woody goes search Buzz and them many adventures happen.",f

It doesn't scare her, and it's teaching her about imagination, friendship, and kindness. All the performances are top notch, and the script is phenomenal. Any movie that has ""Wind the Frog!"" as a line , has to be a classic. The virtual world that has been created is remarkable in itself, but is equally partnered with a wonderful script. The song's compliment and impart in-depth character and plot points and Woody's personal journey is a lesson for all.",t
25,12 December 2014,arjunflamingfeather,10, Cowboy toy is replaced by space ranger toy at a boy's house. The cowboy grows jealous and mishap.,"Hilarious. Thrilling animated tale of toys in our lives. Wondrous done and fast moving. the story unfolds like smoothly and Tom hanks voice is a delight to hear as always. Toys have been a really close part of our childhood whether we care to admit or not. When i was a kid, i din't go to bed hearing bedtime stories, i went exhausted playing (swat cats and power rangers). I used to tie a towel round my neck and fly around. Cars also were a big favorite like the need for speed kind. i used to race them crash them build fortress with chess pieces and escape with the cars. I was a mad kid. Understandably so the real juice of a boy's best friend, toys. The juice of that relationship is captured and created fantastically in this movie. Got to run because there is a snake in my boot. Check the movie out.",t

32,8 September 1998,Amigard,9, Best Disney ever,"Finally a Disney movie which isn't moralistic but just fun to watch. Also it doesn't have the boring ""sing-along-songs"" so this movie is also a perfect movie for anybody about 10 years and (much) older. I really liked the computer-generated graphics because the characters moved very smoothly, something which can't be done the original way. More of these masterpieces in the future please and I will really like Disney at last, but dont't make it to moralistic and musical. That this movie is above all the other Disney -movies in the IMDB top 250 is proof of that.",
33,19 October 2021,Mrbigham13,10, Masterpiece!,"I don't throw around the term masterpiece often so listen up! Ever since I was a child there have been few films that stay with me if any the way that Toy Story does. It's dips into the deepest parts of children's imaginations unlike any animated movie can. Toys that are alive? How cool is that!? Maybe I'm biased because I grew up with it but even today watching again in 2021 I'm still deeply satisfied. The characters, animation, story, and voice work is the finest you'll ever see. The entire franchise is phenomenal but of course nothing can top the original. If you haven't seen this by now you're doing a criminal disservice to yourself and possibly your children. This is the kind of movie that will live on to Infinity and Beyond!",

At least in spirit. You know, like the seniors in the old age home in the Twilight Zone episode 'Kick the Can'. There's a lot to like about this picture; part of it's the cool animation and creative voicing, part of it's the clever use of sight gags that young kids would have no idea about, like the Binford Tool Box and the Punisher logo on Sid's shirt.

42,19 June 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,10," ""You are a toy!""","'Toy Story (1995)' is written incredibly well; everything just seems to fall, very satisfyingly, into place. What sets it apart from pretty much all others in its genre is just how flawed its protagonist is. He's a borderline anti-hero, self-destructively selfish for the movie's majority. This makes his arc all the more satisfying, though, even if it's about as classic as you can get. The friendship that forms between the two central characters feels palpable and genuinely fulfilling because it's nuanced and consistently strained. It really is remarkable that a film about talking toys has some of the most satisfying character arcs and central relationships of all time. Of course, the piece is also very funny. It fully uses its central conceit to deliver some truly inventive laughs. It doesn't feel as though it's pandering to children, either; in fact, it feels rather mature, all things considered. It's a fantastic time that will resonate with everyone who watches. It really is a classic, one to be considered amongst the greats - animated or otherwise. 10/10",

Not too surprisingly, the same reasoning can be applied for animation: we're so used to CGI and 3D animated films that we forgot how groundbreaking Walt Disney's ""Toy Story"" was in 1995, and that we witnessed an event as historical as the release of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"".

Therefore this film can not achieve the rating good (8 out of 10) by me, for a good film (in my opinion) is good on more than just one or two levels and it has to cover the entire film (preferably exceeding in more than one genre).

Careful, artistic shot selection and playful direction really do a lot to compensate for the occasional bad render, and a world-class cast of voice actors takes care of the rest. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen deserve every bit of recognition they get for their roles as Woody and Buzz; they really put the film on their shoulders and carry it right over the top, shifting something that would've probably been pretty good in other hands into a raging success story.",
55,2 March 2020,MissSimonetta,10, All the things that truly matter about the movie have not aged a day,"TOY STORY is a movie I tend to only revisit now and then, but man, is it truly a modern classic! Though the textures and human characters are quite dated by our standards, the story and film-making craft remain timeless. The comedy and suspense play off one another well, and rarely has a domestic setting like this ever felt so epic in scope. Like Disney's debut feature SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, Pixar's TOY STORY is imbued with a sense of playful discovery, innocence, and joy that lets it stand apart from the studio's later output. While they would go on to make more sophisticated films, TOY STORY's strength is in its simplicity and youthful spirit-- just a perfect movie in all the ways that matter.",

It completely absorbs everyone watching no matter the age or the level of maturity, films of Pixar, starting from Toy Story, have kept a certain magical touch around it with an unexpected amount of depth. Everyone as a child imagines their toys will come alive and go on their own adventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does not attract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather with its material. The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting for animated films as there is to a live-action one.

A classic well known movie that everybody loves and remembers after 25 years. The story is so original and creative that it's pretty incredible to imagine how the creators thought of the concept. The idea of toys living and breathing, all aware that they are toys is nothing less than genius. The fact that Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) doesn't even know he is a toy and thinks he's a spaceranger is funny and gives the film a better storytelling. Both characters Woody and Buzz are different from each other, yet have to work together in order to survive. All characters in ""Toy Story"" are amazing, funny and full of characteristic.

The contributions that the film has made to the art, the iconic characters and catchphrases that are now instilled in pop-culture, and a cast that can't be rivaled, Toy Story is an absolute much watch.

79,9 July 2011,nickmesafilms,10, Toy Story (1995) - My Toys are Talking!,"Disney-PIXAR's first ever CGI-animated movie ""Toy Story"" is one of the best animated movies I have seen in years. The movie brings smart ideas, charming heart, and loving characters including Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the gang of toys. The movie begins with Woody, a cowboy toy, who used to be the star of the toy chest, until this new toy arrives after the owner's birthday, named Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger toy, with beliefs that he's a real space ranger. This leads into fr-enemy rivalry involving these two toys, until they learn the true meaning of friendship. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provide the voices for these well-known characters, and they did a great job of bringing talking toys to life. I thought the movie was excellent at writing some kind of every day diary through the eyes of toys. I think Pixar knows how to push the envelope with great ideas of animation, and they started this success with ""Toy Story"". I thought the movie is excellent in every way, it never leaves a single heart, and we grow up watching this movie and we never get tired of watching the old-fashioned buddy pictures, which made ""Toy Story"" a big success to critics and the box office. I really enjoy watching this movie over and over, and it always takes me back to my childhood. ""Toy Story"", in my review, ""brilliant in every way, and always a loving memory"".",

Its biggest assets, a huge beating heart and a great sense of humor, still work so many years later and let you forget about the sometimes flat textures. The story, the characters and the jokes are what draws you into the story and soon after you forget you're actually watching an adventure about living toys. The great voice acting helps too, of course. The result, a glorious collection of exciting and fun action scenes, is so perfect, you sometimes feel the urge to clap applause in responds to the events on the screen. The voice cast of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen fit the characters of Woody and Buzz so perfectly, this film should be seen as a major highlight in their careers. From Pizza Planet, to Sid's House and the race for the moving truck, this film features plenty of memorable scenes and locations.

Woody and the rest of the toys have very good designs that you can't notice the age because of how old you are when you watched this movie for the first time they still hold up this is probably the third best Toy Story film in the franchise I think 4 was worse but 2 and 3 both stood out. I'd say 4,1,3,2 as the order of Toy Story films if I were to rank them, all of them are still A movies guaranteed. Feel free to disagree.

This may be one of the films that I've seen the MOST, considering I watched it a ton when I was a little kid. So much of my young life was themed around this movie. It remains one of my favorites and is one of the best animated movies of all time. Not to mention it kick-started Pixar's reign of excellence. The animation is starting to look a bit dated, but cmon. It was 1995, this was probably the best animation anyone had ever seen up to that point. The story is perfectly written and the concept is even better. Whoever came up with the idea of talking/walking toys with personalities whenever the kids weren't looking is a genius and should've got a nice fat paycheck. I don't know if this'll end up being the BEST pixar movie after my rewatch, but it will definitely be one of the best.

113,22 February 2011,chrisbishop5000,10, One of a kind! - the first computer-animated film and a touching story of friendship,"This movie is just awesome! Bearing in mind that this was a film from 1994/95, the quality of the realistic 3D animation is stunning and what a perfect way to start a new era! Just as a new form of animation comes to life, a vast number of toys magically come to life when their child-owner Andy is out of the room. Maybe that's a true-to-life symbolisation! From the word go, every single one of those toys have become so famous and iconic. Argos (especially), Toys R Us, Amazon, Woolworths and more have never, since the film's 1995-release, been without stock of them! Like it says in the summary, it's a heart-warming story as well as a funny, super-cool movie about a pull-string ragdoll (Woody) whose popularity is short-lived as Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday as a result of new electronic toys hitting the market proving to be better than a just a ragdoll. Understandably, Woody is jealous of Buzz and can't stand his guts. He's an arrogant, self-interested toy but, more than anything else, an total, utter idiot.",

I kept telling myself, in 1995, that I was witnessing something equally ground-breaking and historically important.  And who knows, maybe I was. The four historic films I alluded to above were `The Jazz Singer', `Flowers and Trees', `Becky Sharp' and `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', only the last of which has any claim to being a classic.  `Toy Story' has no great claim, either.

The story is still memorable to this day. Very creative premise, it pulls you in and keeps you hooked from beginning to end. The voice acting is perfect from all of the voice actors. They couldn't have picked better voice actors! The animation holds up to this day, as does the animation in the other Pixar films. Finally, the soundtrack is phenomenal and it helps bring this movie to life. You can play a little part from any part of the music score, and be able to identify what movie it is right away.

Toy Story is about a boy named Andy who, like most of us, had many toys as a kid, but there was always that one special toy that we just played with all the time. For him, it was cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks from ""Big"", ""Apollo 13"", ""Saving Private Ryan"") who feels he'll never be replaced. That all changes on Andy's birthday when he gets a cool spaceman toy, Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen, from the hit 90's sitcom ""Home Improvement"") and all of a sudden, Buzz is his new favorite toy. After ending up stuck in a game machine where ""The Claw"" picks both of them up and a dangerous boy named Sid (voiced by Erik von Detten), has some pretty evil plans for them. This movie has everything a good movie should have: great story, amazing, unforgettable characters, good music score and songs composed by Randy Newman, and some great messages on friendship. Other voices talents include Jim Varney as Slinky, John Ratzenberger as Mr. Potato Head, Don Rickles as Ham, and Wallace Shawn as Rex. Will Woody and Buzz learn to coexist?

And the use of many established comic talents like Don Rickles, Annie Potts, John Ratzenberger (who would become a regular Pixar voice), the late Jim Varney, and especially, Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear. And as with previous Disney animated features, Randy Newman provides such an enjoyably compelling music score as well as several enjoyable songs with a great theme song in ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" that he warbled with Lyle Lovett. And the recent 3-D version just adds to the experience!

It is a film for families that will appeal on different grounds depending on age. It regards a cowboy named Woody and the jealousy that erupts when Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear enters the room on their owner's birthday. Buzz is interesting because he doesn't realize that he is a toy. When Woody causes Buzz to fall out a window an adventure begins that eventually lands them both in nasty Sid's bedroom from next door where a dire fate awaits toys. Grand idea with imaginative filmmaking by director John Lasseter. Where the film goes wrong is its placing supporting characters as types with little purpose. The two leads carry the film with Tom Hanks voicing Woody who goes from important to jealousy to hero in an exciting climax. Tim Allen as Buzz brings much humour in his inability to accept what he is. There is a host of other toys that seem more like fillers. Don Rickles voices Mr. Potato Head and Wallace Shawn voices T-Rex. Jim Varney of Ernest P. Worrell fame voices the loyal Slinky Dog. It contains a theme of love and friendship and for adults it addresses the future of films. Grand achievement, or as the toys put it, ""To infinity and beyond!"" Score: 9 / 10",

Buzz Lightyear, played by Tim Allen brought the right attitude for the newest addition to Andy's (John Morris) toy collection. The story takes us back to the day where we played with toys and used our imaginations to create our own stories. When Andy would leave the room the toys would come to life. A week before Andy's birthday, with his family moving, he is given a party to spend with friends before they leave. The toys plot a way to discover Andy's new presents. After the party the other toys discovered Buzz is one of the presents Andy's receives before he leaves. The main theme of the story to me is ""friendship."" It's a great story relaying the message to be kind to everyone because you never really know when you might need them and your enemy could be your best friend in the end.

I disagree. Much like 1977's 'Star Wars' or 'Citizen Kane,' 'Toy Story' was far before it's time and revolutionized it's genre, in this case: animation. In addition, they took it to the next level with creativity, a perfect combination of humor for both kids and adults as well as an excellent homage to toys people around my age grew up with. I was at the tail-end to some of the toys shown or in the middle when I was a child. So, of course, a great deal of smiles were on my face throughout in remembrance. But, as a movie-lover/amateur critic, it has to go beyond that. I won't like a movie without a great and original script/dialogue, deep characters, good pacing and surprises. This movie has them all. I loved the lines, the voices were pitch perfect, the adventure made up from just from imagination was inventive from minute one and all characters intersected beautifully. Just as child Andy's birthday party is to start, every toy (alive when no one else is around) is worried they'll be replaced and current head-toy cowboy Woody attempts to convince them otherwise. Unfortunately, it is he that's replaced by Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear (love the variances to his name, including ""Light-beer"") who seemingly doesn't know he is anything but an astronaut. Not too far deep into the story is a touching realization/awakening for both and great learning for the people watching, kids and adults alike. Excellent movie, perfect start for the apparently unbeatable Pixar studios and suitable for all ages. (Side note: 2009's 3-D version worth watching, but adds little to the already masterpiece it is.)",

It is truly a brilliant concept. Young Andy's cowboy doll Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) becomes jealous when Andy starts paying more attention to his new space toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). Buzz, however, does not grasp the fact that he's actually a toy and thinks he is a space ranger here by mistake. Hanks and Allen are the perfect voices for these characters, as are Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, and numerous others. There are more great one-liners in this film than any other family film I can recall, one of the best being Buzz's ""I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school."" I have seen this film countless times, and it has become a true classic. It's masterfully done, not only being the first fully computer animated film, but also for it's superb writing and concept. Everything about the film, from the staff meeting scene in the beginning to Buzz seeing his TV ad, is perfectly done. Randy Newman's three original songs are all excellent. ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" lost to Pochahontas' ""Colors of the Wind,"" which I also love, but I'm not sure which was better; maybe this. Anyway, see this film. It's a treat to all ages.",

The animation was amazing, and phenomenal when it first came out and still holds up today. The voice actors even did a great job, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did a great job with there performance in portraying Woody and Buzz Lightyear. It was a exciting adventure, although the plot was simple it was effective and entertaining.The story is about toys coming to life, but keeping themselves secret by acting like they aren't alive. But the toys coexist with humans peacefully, except the toys in Andy's room get worried on birthdays and Christmases of being replaced. Thus when Andy's favorite toy get replaced by a new favorite toy, the conflict starts from there when the older toy that was Andy's favorite tries to hide the new toy, but ends up hitting it out the window. Although this day and age, kid's who are about Andy' age probably won't play with the types of toys portrayed in the movie, and the magic was sort of lost from when I saw it when I was in elementary.

So it should have been an easy choice for my 900th review with Toy Story craze back on with the new and equally as amazing third installment. Toy Story brings to life some of the greatest characters in film history. You will fall in love with all the characters within the first 15 minutes and makes every step of their fantastical adventure even more captivating. The adventure they go on when you look at it from a truth standpoint is no more than 'down the street' and back but when you're a 3-6 inch toy that changes everything and that is truly the brilliance of Toy Story. You will become one of these toys, their world is so real to you and you see everything from their perspective.

The story is about Woody the cowboy(voiced by Tom Hanks)who is a toy along with many other toys that come to life when no one is in the room. All of the toys are owned by Andy a young boy who lives with his mom and his sister. So on the eve of Andy's birthday he ends up getting a new toy,the Buzz Lightyear toy which is a very popular toy who is a space ranger. So when Woody is introduced to Buzz Lightyear(voiced by Tim Allen)Woody ends up being jealous of him and he would do anything to be the center of attention again.

168,17 February 2017,sol-,7, Falling with Style,"In a world in which toys talk and move whenever humans are not looking, a cowboy doll experiences jealousy for the very first time after an action figure replaces him as his owner's favourite toy in this popular animated comedy. The premise lends itself to a number of perplexing unanswered questions (in particular, regarding the 'rules' that the toys follow to freeze as soon as there is the possibility of a human seeing them move) but if one accepts the basic notion and runs with it, the film offers a surprisingly compelling story with striking personal identity themes as both of the main toys come to realise that they are not as special as they once thought. For Woody, it comes with realising that his owner can have other favourite toys and for Buzz it comes from awakening to the fact that he actually is a toy and not the famous space commander that he is designed as being. The film is blessed by excellent animation effects too; while many entirely computer generated animated films have come out in the years since, few have used the process quite so delightfully with lots of mobile tracking and panning shots that would have been near impossible to get right in a live action feature. The changing facial reactions on the toys (especially Woody) are impressive too - even if the fact that the toys in the film look more realistic than the humans in the film never quite feels right. This is, of course, a film about the toys though, and fanciful as the premise may well be, there is a lot to like about their loyalty both towards their owners and each other.",

Its energy unmistakable; its inspiration unequalled and its charm unmatched, in what is a milestone in animation for reasons much more than the fact the computer generated imagery was as fresh as it was. Vaugely, the memory of seeing it for the first time many years ago stands in rather stark comparison to whatever I recall of the rest of that viewing when it was revealed Toy Story was to be, quite literally, about the toys and their coming to life so as to interact and engage with their surroundings. In starting in the manner it does, with a young boy named Andy animating his toys to as to bring them to life and interact with what's around them as it ran on whatever meek story he could come up with and not knowing a thing about the premise or indeed content, ignorantly, I led myself into believing the entire piece would be of this ilk; quite literally, a toy story about toys being what they are: inanimate objects being interacted with by a child. Imagine the sense of surprise mixed with awe and glee when Woody sits up in Andy's room and announces that ""the coast is clear!"" to the rest of the toys.",

Woody is Andys favorite toy until one day Andys birthday comes around and he gets a new toy which quickly becomes Andys favourite toy ahead of Woody. Woody quickly becomes jealous because not only has Andy pushed him aside but his fellow toy friends have chosen the new toy Buzz Lightyear ahead of Woody so now Woody plots a way to get Buzz out of the way for good with disastrous consequences. I will say no more about the movie as i feel if you haven't seen it then most of this film should be a surprise to you.

It also enters an arcade- restaurant that recaptures that consumerist wonder of being a kid surrounded by video games and pizza. Its heroes are toys, which come to life when nobody is watching. Its conflict is between an old-fashioned cowboy doll who has always been an 8-year-old boy's favorite toy, the effective leader of the kid's toys as a collective community, and the new action figure who is starting to take his place. The villain is the grungy kid next door who takes toys apart and puts them back together again in morbid mishmashes, that is when he's not blowing them with fireworks.

182,19 September 2014,charliejennifercheng,10," The First,The Best and the Influential","Eventually Toy Story was everything of my childhood,from the imagination and the belief that the toys would come to life,to the tongue in cheek script that get me laughing a lot,the story that makes me think and value till today on how a great story can make a huge impact to people and the likable characters that I grew up loving and having these toys as those played in my childhood.Its animation,though it was made at that time when CGI animation was just starting,or they did started the whole thing was top notch till today when I watched it in Hi Def.As it was always,it was the everything that a great movie could offer. We started with a simple yet powerful plot about a toy cowboy doll who is on top of his game,admiration and respect from his fellow toys as well as the unconditional love he has from his owner,Andy.However this has changed,only for temporary when his owner brought in a new toy that he had just got as a birthday present,a space superhero action figure and due to his arrival ,the space superhero did got every thing of admiration and love that the cowboy once have that the cowboy was always sidelined from everything.This thus turned into an outrage of jealousy that the cowboy and the space superhero ended up getting into a conflict so severe that he got pushed out of the window so that his beloved owner would not find him,however it was lucky that the space superhero survived and thus another fight occurs this time in the petrol station.They then went onto a pizza delivery truck where their owner was there and ended up again being held captive by a cruel,yet troubled neighbor named Sid who just loves to torture toys every day.And together as they were held captive,they then have to come in terms to work together in order to save themselves from the captive they were in and also to get back to their owner who they then realized have love them unconditionally,Andy which is by far one of the most realistic plot I've ever come across,though it is viewed in a toy's perspective. The movie themes itself was also powerful itself.Though it is a kids movie,it deals with themes of jealousy,abduction,cruelty and suicide as well of positive themes of leadership,cooperation,love and friendship.It is a movie that plays well with every theme so well that it deserves to be praised to its highest point.It was a movie of all genre,from horror to action to comedy and to being inspirational at all claims which most movies did not have these days.Today,we do have the various types of CGI animated movies,from the ultra good (The Incredibles,How To Train Your Dragon,Monsters Inc) to the mediocre(Rise of The Guardians,Cars,Over The Hedge,Wreck It Ralph) the ultra bad( Frozen,Brave,Turbo,Antz,Chicken Little,Shark Tale ),but none can ever come to the touch of magic that Toy Story did left in many people's hearts.Also Toy Story is also the biggest reason to every animation student on why they wanted to study animation especially 3D at the first place.Without Toy Story we would not even think that taking a leap to animation would be really very possible for many aspiring animators and film directors of that line.Overall,Toy Story,which is honesty the first animated film that I grew up watching in my life(I was four a that time), was the first that I grew up loving everything from the movie.It it quite strange that it is only later that I've realized that this hugely influential movie was released at the same year that I was born,1995 which has then installed the love of animation towards me and my whole life.And it is when I've watched this movie is that I've decided on what I've wanted to do entirely ,directing an animated movie that is as groundbreaking as Toy Story. Overall,in my personal words,it is very tough to pen a review on a movie that you've loved so much in your life and has made a great impact on your career path.Personally ,Toy Story is an amazing film that was not over-hyped,but rather talked due to its legacy and greatness from everything it has,thus it should be remembered by many generations to come.Finally,I would like to thank John Lasseter,Ed Catmull and also whoever who has been involved in the production of this wonderful movie for opening the doors to many aspiring animators out there that anyone can live the legacy that Walt Disney did formerly",

Now, most everything they put out is outdated postmodern trash that portrays all children as geniuses able to rule the world and all parents as evil minions trying to keep their children from having fun. Thank God for Pixar coming to existence. Starting with Toy Story in 1995, they made a great family film that appeals to adult humor as well as children. They haven't failed since. They can do no wrong it seems, and I pray it continues that way. Of all their great films, this is undoubtedly in my mind the best of them all. It is also arguably better than any animated film Disney ever did, including the classics of the 1940s and 50s. The premise is so clever and daring in that it could go wrong in so many ways. It never does, though, and in a mere 82 minutes, it covers more information than many other 2 hour films. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have become iconic in their roles as Woody and Buzz. The animation and dialogue is so good it is as if they are really on screen arguing with one another. The supporting characters are also very good and funny. With animation, perhaps the most important aspect is the voice characters. Pixar has done a great job of not always going with a star to do the voices, but rather simply going with the one that fits the character best. Overall, Toy Story is superb film-making with a great script, wonderful voices and animation that still impresses despite all the technological improvements. Thank you, Pixar.

The computer animation revolution had to start somewhere and that somewhere was Toy Story. The animators at Pixar made the impossible possible. You watch the movie today and it's easy to take it for granted. You forget that Pixar was attempting something entirely new and that there were more than a few doubts as to whether it would work. Oh, it worked alright. It worked spectacularly. Director John Lasseter and his animation team created a visually stunning masterpiece the likes of which had never been seen before.

Only a few months later would the first and very elegant Beauty and The Beast be released. But behind the scenes, they negotiated a deal with a small animation studio named Pixar, previously only animating shorts to demonstrate the capabilities of their computers. John Lasseter would serve as director after being fired from Disney as he pitched the revolutionary idea of the first ever fully computer animated full length feature film. And so Toy Story was born. It was a long and complicated production process full of worries about budget, and the infamous Black Friday reveal which prompted a production shut-down and a full script revamp. It's sequel would later nearly undergo a disaster of similar scale. But after an arduous process Toy Story became a ground breaking film in animation history and set the first benchmark for 3D animation. ",

I also liked the end title duet. The score was good too. I wasn't over impressed by the animation since I consider story & characters to be more important.

Even so, watching Toy Story for the first time in over a decade, it exceeded my expectations in its characters and script, and the animation looks as good as ever. Woody's internal struggles and seeing a protagonist of a kid's movie be clearly flawed but still likable is so refreshing. I love the animosity between Woody and Buzz, and the way the toys each have their own quirks but are something of a hive mind. Even if the events that occur are a bit over the top, the structure and plot is actually really exciting and coherently presented. I loved the misjudgement of Sid's toys and their role in the success. I've seen movies twice as long fail to deliver on half as realistic and well fleshed out characters or emotional stakes as in Toy Story. Between the groundbreaking animation for the time, the consistent characters and plot, and sheer adolescent joy and adventure, Toy Story deserves its place as a classic.",

Special mention for Tom Hanks as you really cannot separate his voice from Woody's character. It works on every level. Kids love it, as do teenagers, young adults and pensioners like me too. The songs by Randy Newman are not too intrusive and actually enhance the story and move it on too. The amount of work that must have gone into the brainstorming before production started must have been amazing. It would have been great to have an insight into all that.

The animation was great, the actors were all talented, and the whole storyline is awesome! When Andy started to like Buzz Lightyear more than Woody, I felt really sorry of Woody, but I'm glad that Andy didn't just get rid of Woody; Andy still loved all his toys, even though he liked Buzz Lightyear more for a while.

It was a thoroughly enjoyable film and i think it had all the qualities of a classic. There are some things that i think can be improved on and that's why this film can only get 9 from me Firstly i would like to question who really is the bad guy in this film? is it Sid a lonely boy who only has a faithful dog as a friend. Or is it Andy who as soon as he gets a new toy seems to disregard a toy that he had had for years and (spoiler) that turns out to be a collectible item in the next film and would pocket the family quite a lot of money.

Everyone in my class used to get schoolbags, lunchboxes, water bottles etc of Pixar cartoons. The three most popular ones were of Woody, Buzz Lightyear and Mr Incredible. In my review of The Incredibles I mentioned how I hated The Incredibles until I watched it myself, since I came from a conservative family which didn't allow me to watch foreign films. I finally watched Toy Story when I was 15 years old, and this was so awesome! Later I got to know that it was the first ever 3D animated movie, and since then my respect for it has increased exponentially.",

This movie took its execution on the concept of living toys to a whole new level thanks to a very engaging story. The characters are also highly memorable. And the humor is very clever with some jokes the movie can get away with. The animation can look outdated, but there's no denying it looks really good to this day. This is the kind of CGI animation we had back in the earlier days. Funny enough, I have seen some deleted scenes that I'm honestly glad it didn't make it to the movie. Otherwise, they would keep this from being Pixar's amazing debut. If you're in the mood to watch a comedy or something related to Pixar, this is definitely worth checking out.

Not only is the film irresistibly funny it is also has a clever story and unlike many movies of today you can watch this one over and over. The voices are done by a host of popular names that we all know and love. Some of the most popular being Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, and John Ratzenberger as Hamm. Jim Varney even lends his hilarious voice as Slinky the Dog. The story is about a boy (Andy) that gets a new toy (Buzz Lightyear) for his birthday. Andy's previous favorite toy (Woody) feels forgotten. After a series of mis-adventures the two find themselves away from the home and must learn to work together to find their way back.

For example, the shot of woody hanging off the moving truck is one of the best ever. The aerial view of Woody hanging off the truck makes him really tiny and worthless. However the shot goes to a close up of Woody ,and makes him feel like a hero in some type of way. This movie changed the way we feel about toys as a whole too.

We get into the behind of the scenes: The toys are not just living a simple life, but they have their own community with their own rules, routines, and cultures, brought by all types of toys, everything from a shark toy to a potato head.

All the sequels and shorts of the series that exist so far all have very memorable and heartwarming moments practically during every big moment of the film. The adventures these toys have will never get any more interesting and exciting. Every other main character besides the first two mentioned are all well thought out and are just as memorable as the other two.

It reminded me of The Breakfast Club, whose main theme seemed to be ""Conform to the style of the popular kids, and all your problems will dissipate."" This is just so wrong.  If you want to see really good computer animation that will amuse you, inspire your children to be good and strong and true, and which predates this  shallow and uninspiring vehicle, check out the television series Reboot, now being re-run on Cartoon Network.

I am one of them. The animation is of course crude by today's standards, but it was made in a way that makes it seem like 1995 wasn't that long ago. As dated as it looks, we can still appreciate it for being more than just a test of what computers could render. As for complaints, the jokes could have been funnier and the story could have less instances of convenience, like how Buzz and Woody enter the Pizza Planet Truck and come across a nice, high pile of pizza boxes to hide behind. There were also some errors in the anatomy of some toys, like RC. I won't take points off for the animation because hey, it was 1995 and Pixar had up to that point only been making shorts for 11 years, so it isn't something to grouch over (even though there were some superficial glitches like disappearing lights between scenes). All I can say is, see it soon and brace for a higher intrigue of the early history of CGI.",

359,29 April 2023,atleverton,6, Ground breaking...but animation doesn't hold up,"Oy Story is definitely a monumental film. It's the first 3d CGI animated film. It has great voice acting from Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, and the characters of Woody and Buzz are very well-defined. The conflict is set up quite nicely and there's a satisfying story within the movie. There are moments that are genuinely terrifying for children and for adults. Another great thing about the film is the iconic song You've Got a Friend in Me. Randy Newman really excels at writing those kinds of songs. Having said all of that and getting a mountain of praise out of the way for the movie which it completely deserves it, the film doesn't really hold up. The animation is very creepy, it is solidly in the uncanny valley. The toy characters are fine because they're toys, and you don't expect toys to look life-like. In that sense, it was a great choice to kick off computer animation with a film about toys. But there are some human characters in the film, and they are horrifying-they look really, really creepy, they don't move naturally. The faultiness of the animation really brings it down for me, and it's kind of ironic because they needed to make the movie to push the technology forward, but the technology wasn't really at a point where it could make a satisfying movie.",

The soundtrack is amazing and fits the tone of the movie perfectly, the voice acting is unreal and every voice fits the character down to the ground and this truly is Tom Hanks' most iconic role.

363,15 November 2014,byson5186,9, Why The First Toy Story Is My Favorite,"So far they have come out with 3 Toy Story movies, and I also saw like a spooky Toy Story movie at RedBox and thought I heard that they are going to make a 4th one. It's interesting to think how this movie is from 1995 and was like the first fully computer animated movie, while nowadays almost all the animated movies we see are computer animated rather than the old days when they were digitally animated drawings. I miss those old cartoon movies. Anyway, Toy Story is definitely a classic movie. Kids today can watch the movie, and it probably won't seem like an old movie to them. They have made other Toy Story movies which seemed to earn more money than the first one. But, I will talk about why the first one is the best. The first one introduced us to the Toys in Toy Story, yeah they add some new toys in the later films, but this one is the first real introduction. It's always nice to remember the introduction of the characters we are familiar with in later films. Also, the later films seem to be more about adventures from the toys we know together in a group, in this movie it was mostly just the adventure of our favorite toys, Woody and Buzz. We see Woody's reaction to having Buzz as the new popular toy. Also, this one seems more about survival for Woody and Buzz, while in the other Toy Story movies it seems like it's less about survival and more about getting back to where they belong. Another reason to like this movie, from what I know while Pizza Planet is mentioned in other Pixar movies, this is the only one which shows them inside a Pizza Planet. I've always thought, that restaurant would be really cool to be at if it were a real restaurant. About Pizza Planet, I remember way back in 6th Grade in the scene when we see the Pizza Planet pick-up truck at the gas station and we hear the guys in it ask for directions to Pizza Planet, somebody in the classroom asked the teacher why would somebody who worked at Pizza Planet be asking for directions on how to get there? My teacher didn't know how to answer. In this movie we get to know Andy's original house and his neighborhood. We get to know the villain in this movie, Sid. The villains in the other movies are like the Chicken Man, Stinky Pete, and Lotso and some of his gang. I'm sure most of us could agree that our favorite bad guy in these Toy Story movies is Sid and let me give a few reasons to why we might like him the best. For one, Sid is Andy's next door neighbor. What's weird is the movie doesn't give any indication of whether Andy and Sid knew each other, so it can leave us with that question. Sid isn't like a bad guy, I mean he plays in the movie as a bad guy, but he seems to play a character we could imagine his age. I mean about a 13 year old boy who wears a T Shirt with a skeleton. He's aggressive and he likes torturing toys as a hobby of his, obviously not aware that the toys are alive. He likes explosives and stuff, and has a dark atmosphere in his room, along with mostly keeping his room locked. So, he's a G rated version of an early adolescent character who is supposed to be like the bad guy and he doesn't swear, talk about alcohol, drugs, or sex. He isn't like a criminal, just a scary kid with a dark atmosphere who likes to be the bad guy to toys he doesn't realize are alive. The climax in this movie also seems more exciting than the climax in the other movies. One thing we can find hard to believe, is how the toys have all these wacky adventures, doing things that somebody could easily notice, and nobody seems to be aware that the Toys are alive. Toy Story doesn't seem like The Velveteen Rabbit, but more like Toys who are having their own adventures, a little like The Lego Movie, where the Toys seem more alive than they seem like Toys. This is a great movie, I'd give a 9/10.",
364,10 November 2014,smithclarkst,6, A Great Funny Movie,I sat down to watch this movie again - and was totally blown away. It actually pretty scary for a child movie. Sid is one of the best villains I've ever seen and Woody's jealousy is really well done. The emotions and characters in the movie are complex and satisfying to watch. I can see the point of those people who complain about it being too scary for their kids - I'd say don't watch this with under five year old unless your child is a horror junkie.,

Toy Story is a cartoon about a little boy's toy collection that is alive when the little boy is not around. His name is Andy and he loves his toys, and they love him back. Woody is a cowboy and is Andy's favorite toy. The toys always get worried every Christmas and birthday because they fear they will be replaced by a bigger and better toy. The story starts off with Andy's birthday party and all of the toys are on edge. It turns out that a new toy by the name of Buzz Lightyear challenges Woody as the favorite toy. Buzz comes along, steals a little bit of the spotlight and Woody gets incredibly jealous. Eventually Woody and Buzz get lost and must find their way home and back to Andy before he and his family move away forever.",

In fact, he worries about others replacing him all the time. At last, he admitted that bath Lightyear was cool, he admitted that he was ordinary, and finally he could face up to himself. Ordinary is not terrible. What's terrible is not to accept your ordinary. Buzz Lightyear always thought he was a space trooper and a superhero. A TV advertisement broke his dream and let him hit the wall of reality. Cowboys and astronauts, civilians and heroes, have different identities and different positions, but the transformation of re understanding themselves is the same. The first growth is from ambition to reality; the second growth is to learn to pursue dreams after being down-to-earth. The most common Hu Di can also unite all toys, scare away the villains and save Buzz Lightyear; Buzz Lightyear, who can't fly, actually soars in the sky and fulfills his dream of flying.

A clever, sharp and imaginative screenplay expertly voiced by a stellar cast (I would give this 5/10 just for casting Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head) keeps the swiftly moving story engaging throughout, flagging only a bit when self- deluded toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) is briefly depressed. The film hops from one great set-piece to the next with head-spinning speed that leaves me marveling at how simple director John Lasseter and the team of animators make it look to bring these toys to life with just a few touches of individuality. Every viewer will probably have their favorite parts. Back when I first saw the movie upon its initial release, mine was the new-age toys who worship the Claw; upon recent viewing, I think it is ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" rendition of evil neighbor Sid's bedroom.

You can ignore the breakthrough aspect of the graphics and it remains a fun story with some very witty dialog. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen do great voice work as the lead toys, with Cowboy Bob's jealousy of new toy Buzz Lightyear providing the fuel for most of the story. They're both hilarious as Bob plays the brains, and hatches schemes for this and that, including spooking the evil kid next door who tortures and blows up toys for fun. Buzz is mostly on the job thinking he really is a Space Ranger, loses his self identity when he finds out he is just a toy, winding up as a tea time doll for a little girl. In the end, though, they come together and save the day and themselves just in time...8.7/10 This DVD is part of the Toy Story 2 Pack, but I believe the actual movie transfers are the same in all the retail packages.

406,3 July 2016,anthonymichaelbangert,10, Pixar's First Movie Hits Perfectly,"Toy Story was the movie to put Pixar on the map. In 1995, John Lasseter released a mega hit upon the world with one of the best computer animated movies of all time. It launched a huge career for the studio, dropping hit after hit even to this day. This is the story of a toy named Woody (Tom Hanks), a Cowboy Sheriff toy with a pull string voice box. He is owner Andy's favorite toy. But Andy gets a new toy in the form of a space ranger named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who actually believes he is Buzz, not a toy. Woody starts to feel left out and replaced. In an attempt to remain the favorite, Woody knocks Buzz out a window. The other toy's commit mutiny on him because this, and Woody goes out into the big, scary human world to bring Buzz back. The 2 toys adventure together eventually leads them to neighbor Sid's house, where the must escape before Sid's favorite pastime of blowing up toys turns on them. This movie was a pure stroke of genius. It showed off the technology computers could all have, and what the future of animation could be. Choosing toys as the focus was smart, because the animation was still fairly new, and therefore still a little plastic looking. So toys, which should look artificial, seemed to look decent. The voice acting in this movie is fantastic too. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen play well off each other and provide great characters. Woody's jealousy and angry outbursts contrasts well with Buzz's conceited yet naive nature. The supporting cast give great performances as well, and allow the toys to each have their own distinct personalities which, when put together, make them feel like a family. The soundtrack of this movie was done by Randy Newman, who made one the most sugary songs that I love. ""You Got a Friend in Me"" is known by most, as it is the quintessential Toy Story song. It is like a theme song to everything this movie is. The ultimate friendship between a human and his toys, but also between two life- long buddies. This movie promoted love, imagination, and friendship. It was a kids film that adults could relate to. It was everything that Pixar continues to stand on today. And everyone should see it. I give this film a 10/10. PS: Because this is Pixar, I gotta mention the good luck charm. In this film John Ratzenberger plays Hamm, the piggy bank. He's a fun character with good quips. One of my favorites he did.",

It was the 1st 3D movie of its time and brought many kids to see it. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen just made the movie even better with the toy that didn't want to let go and his owner to like the new toy on the block. It is very touching and as a kid I could not get enough of this movie. I can watch about 10 times in a row and mostly anyone else can.

413,8 September 2011,djansen24,9, Where it all begins...,"Pixar strikes out in feature films with its first full-lengther, and the results are stunning! They set the bar almost impossibly high for anyone else interested in getting into full length computer animation. But what made Toy Story have such staying power and make the characters immediately house-hold names wasn't so much the technical brilliance (although it did dazzle), but the storytelling. Okay, case in point. Independence Day. The media hyped this up and it got a lot of viewers. It had a lot of effects. It dazzled our eyes (not our hearts) on the big screen. It sold a lot of DVDs. It made a lot of money...during its run. So who remembers it much now? For that matter, who will remember much of just about any of Roland Emmerich's films years from now? But who can forget Woody, Andy, Buzz, etc.? Who can forget that bedroom? Who can forget Sid? The writers at Pixar took a great idea which was understanding how many of us (even as adults) have emotional attachments to our toys and found a way to bring the heart of that idea and nail it down to a heartwarming story about friendship. That the technical details are flat out amazing for its time was an added bonus (even seeing reflections from Buzz's space helmet -- they didn't have to do that! The animators threw that in just to make the experience all the more special and believable). No other studio has ever come up to the standard set by Pixar. Dreamworks hasn't, though they have made a good film or 2. Sony Pics hasn't, etc. etc. Because they lack a great story to begin with, and when they do land upon one, they muck it up by trying to make it something it isn't. I can almost hear the writers in their studios thinking, ""Well, this is good, but we need to add more adult jokes so that the parent's won't get bored."" Advice, just follow Pixar's example and let the story unfold as it needs to. Pixar got it right and has gotten it right up through Toy Story 3. I fear we may be in for a nadir of creativity as we move into Cars 2, but we'll see...",

It had great animation, great characters and a great story! My favorite character was the Slinky Dog played by my favorite comedian the late Jim Varney (God rest his soul). I loved it towards the end when Slinky is trying to get Woody and Buzz into the moving van and the others toys in the moving van pull on him so hard that he begins to stretch out! That was hilarious! I also liked it when Slinky says Come on PotatoHead! If Woody says it's all right well darn it it's good enough for me! Woody has never stared us wrong before! With Toy Story PIXAR showed us what Computer Animation could do to tell a great story! Toy Story like Snow White it an animated classic that'll go on forever!

426,10 June 2019,Ryan_Barbakins,8, A Perfect Start to a New Animation Era,"This film was the very beginning of CG animated films that completely dominate the animation industry now. And seeing as it is the very first of its kind, a likely assumption is that it is not very good. However when you watch this film you will find out that is so far from the truth.
Toy Story not only started a new art style, a new era of film, comedy, and entertainment, but it also is a genuinely heartfelt incredible film! Pixar was able to make human beings feel sympathy for inanimate objects. That alone is noteworthy, but it goes even farther than that. This film is so entertaining and exciting; you will not want to look away from the screen. The animation has definitely aged, however that doesn't take away from the fact that this story and these characters are timeless. Woody and Buzz have cemented themselves in pop culture and all of our childhoods, and even when viewed on a critical level, these characters and this film is amazing!
Even though I adore this film, I feel like when compared to 2 and 3, this one is the worst out of those, because 2 and 3 discover a story that's even more intriguing and thought-provoking than this one.
There were some instances in this film that felt kind of cliche, and convenient, ie: the random gust of wind that made Buzz fly at the end. But in its heart, this film is far from bad, and is waaaaay better than most animated features being released today on every level (except animation).

Just last year, Pokemon kinda broke me out of my ""macho mode"" and brought me back to those simple pleasures.  Taught me not to hide the child in me.  So, my mom says we're taking care of my little cousin and wants to know if there's a movie out that we could see.  I mentioned Toy Story 2 (he and I already saw Pokemon, the most underrated movie of '99), but hadn't seen the first one. So, I drove over to his house to watch Toy Story.  Man, what I was missing. This is a terrific movie, but not because of the great animation.  The animation is cool, but like I've said, don't be that superficial that you judge the movies completely on animation.

It is an amazing standalone, kid, and Pixar film with all the great motifs of all. It teaches children good values about who are in the world, and mortality. It also appeals to all ages and has incredible animation for 1995, and also was great enough to be unforgotten all the way until now 2015, 20 years later. Buzz's realization that he is just another product to be sold in the world, is in my opinion, one of the greatest moments of movie and entertainment history. The movie gives you a lot of things to speculate on like is Woody a bad toy? Or can a movie have virtually no villain but the hero or at all? The choice is 100% yours and that is what I love most about the movie. It is absolutely timeless and unforgettable and I highly suggest watching it.",
438,18 November 2015,avonfoxglove,3, It's okay but over hyped,"I saw Toy Story in theaters when it first came out and it was alright but I wasn't impressed. Over the years I've come to dislike it rather than feeling neutral toward it. The concept of the movie wasn't new to me because I had already seen the Jim Henson film The Christmas Toy which was basically the same but instead of Woody the cowboy being the main character it was a tiger plush toy named Rigby and I prefer puppetry over CG anyway. Given that this movie was made in the early days of CG the people look really weird and fake, almost creepy, even the good characters. It seems to mainly focus on the petty squabbles between the jealous cowboy and the delusional spaceman. While the film has a few jokes the kids might not get, my over all impression is that the whole story lacks depth. You could maybe read between the lines and infer things but the movie glosses over most of the more serious stuff to keep the mood light. I didn't find any of the characters particularly likable either.",

It also brought animation from the ""cutie-cutie"", good always beats evil of Disney, introducing a more up-to-date cynicism, slightly dark & gray material, such as the kid Sid and even our hero Woody - though the latter is the main subject matter in that he is attempting to redeem himself. The characters are rich, three dimensional(Most are - except for most humans which is quite ironic and charming) Future generations will love these characters and they will endure forever. Toy Story 2 unashamedly attempts to bring the girls into the action with the lively girl-cowboy character Jessie, and while it is also very successful it just never reaches the freshness found in the original TOY STORY.",

You feel as if you know them thoroughly by the conclusion and are moved by the life lessons they've learned, lessons you would want any child to learn. In addition to the main performers, the voice cast is perfectly suited to the toys they're called upon to represent: there's Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, the late Jim Varney as Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as Rex, the timid dinosaur, Annie Potts as Bo Peep and John Ratzenberger as Hamm, the talking pig. Laurie Metcalf is the voice of the child's mother. A supreme accomplishment, you can watch it over and over again and still find something new every time--it's animation's ""Citizen Kane"".",

Toy Story's plot is about a boy named Andy whose playing with his toys, such as a Mr. Potato Head, Rex, and his favorite toy, Woody. He takes Woody into the living room and plays with him some more, where he learns Andy has planned his birthday a few days early, as himself, his mother, and his sister Molly will be moving. Woody gets put back in the room, and when Andy leaves, he's revealed to be the leader of the toys, and orders them to be prepared for the party. All the toys work together, aware that new toys could mean the replacement of current ones, but Woody keeps them calm.

The voice acting are amazing, all the actors fits in their respective roles. However, this movie has it's negatives.

Everyone as a child imagines their toys will come alive and go on their own adventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does not attract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather with its material. The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned voice over.

I seriously think this is the true Pixar masterpiece without any flaws, I like all of their films but I can not find anything wrong with this film even if I try to nitpick, I like all of the characters even Bo-Beep with her exaggerated expression when she yells when she sees Buzz's arm in Sid's room.

However, it's only the abundance of objective things. In toy story, a boy with many toys but does not have heart to treat toys dearly is suppose to be punished. This suggests the situation of modern society, and reminds us the importance to treat things carefully. Another point that I like in this film is, the growth of the cowboy. When he meets Buzz for the first time, he did not accept Buzz, because he couldn't understand everything about Buzz. Moreover, his position was taken over because of Buzz's appearance. However, he learns the importance of understanding other people, through the adventure to return to home. Also, Buzz finally comes to understand Woody.

Pixar and Disney not only knock our socks off with the most amazing computer generated animation, but the writers of this story hit a home-run and totally captured the whimsical innocence of what we all knew was going on when we were kids; that our toys are alive and only want to be played with and cherished. In addition, the superb voice acting by a cast of actors that obviously still remember being a kid, only gives this instant classic the status of being the ""Gold Standard"" to which all others in this category will have to be judged.

A statement that proves to be ironic when he later looks up at a toy from space, Buzz Lightyear (Allen). Woody's owner is growing older and Woody struggles to accept the change as Buzz becomes Andy's new favourite toy. Leading from the once strong leader into a bout of jealousy and even malice as he tries to take Buzz out of the picture. Woody is then separated from Andy via a fight with Buzz and has to find a way home. Further change occurs as Woody is forced to align with Buzz to escape the toy antagonist Sid.

It doesn't matter that animation is 100 times more detailed and cooler today than it was in 1995, when the movie first came out. The strength of this movie is in the story. There is so much territory to explore on this flic, and you have so much fun while you watch it, that you will never grow tired of it. And, with a 2.5-year old who loves to see Woody once and again, I can tell you it really doesn't get old, no matter how many times you watch it! The second disc does a superb job of accompanying the Pixar classic, going into the legendary details that have made Pixar's DVDs famous. There is plenty to sink your teeth into, for the die-hard fans and those who are simply a bit curious alike. The entire package is a movie for all ages, for the ages.

Toy Story does this for kids and adults by reminding us that life is a journey of experiences, reflection, and growth. Many of the social issues that plague children and adolescents are addressed within this film. Peer pressure, stealing to get what you want, confronting violence, insecurity, jealously, competition, first-love, friendship, and revenge are all parts of the magic of Toy Story. Humor is employed to skillfully and thoughtfully weave these trying issues throughout the script. Most importantly, the characters demonstrate that we must learn to think about what we are doing and how our actions affect our own life and the lives around us.",
524,22 May 2019,cbobs,10, By far my favorite Pixar movie and my second favorite Disney and animated film in general. Joint with 2 and 3,"No wait, I literally cannot rank all three Toy Story movies because i love them all equally. But if i had to choose i would probably say 1,3 and then 2. I mean what's not to love about Toy Story. A sharp-witted, cleverly written story about toys coming to life. I mean, do you notice why there hasn't been another big or successful film following the same idea of toys coming to life. Because, this is the perfect one. Nothing will ever be able to top it. They've set the bar way too high. Such a great premise which is played off brilliantly. Tom Hanks is my favorite ever animated voice actor. The energy he radiates through his words prove why he is my favorite actor of all time. His best quote OBVIOUSLY being ""YOU ARE A TOYYYYY!!!!!"" Tim Allen also does an excellent job. Especially, with the 'Mrs Nesbitt!!' scene and bits from earlier on when he believes he is a Space Ranger. Other actors like John Ratzenberger and Don Rickles do well and Wallace Shawn does a great job with voicing the lovable dinosaur Rex. However, this is by far my favorite Pixar film, but not my favorite Disney or animated film in general. I would have to give that to 'The Lion King.' At the time, this film would have been so technically impressive. I mean this was mid 90's and the affects still look great today. With such a great premise for a film, it plays it to it's advantages and making everyday boring objects seem like an obstacle for the toys. Probably the best example of this is 'The Claaaw.' Yes, the arcade machine that is often criticized for scamming people by making them pay money for a slim chance of winning a soft toy is used as a plot device. But does that stop me from getting that Spider-man or Ant Man plushie. Hell no! The world they create through the film is so creative and well done that it's hard not to call the film a masterpiece. So let's talk about the plot. Woody is a cowboy toy who is the leader of all the other toys in Andy's room. The toys job is to be played with and keep Andy happy. Oh and also not to be seen alive. Anyway, on Andy's birthday a new toy shows up. A popular space ranger toy named Buzz Lightyear. However, Buzz actually believes he is a space ranger and not a toy. He proves it by 'flying' when instead he is just using a hot wheels track and a lampshade to swing around. This leads top one of the greatest film quotes of all time ""That wasn't flying that was falling with style."" However, both the toys and Andy seem to admire Buzz leaving Woody jealous. Which refers to the astronaut takeover in the 1960's when kids stopped idolizing cowboys and began idolizing astronauts and 'space rangers.' Woody creates a plan to get rid of Buzz by pushing him out of the window. It works but leads to him and Buzz getting stranded at a gas station. They manage to follow Andy to a Pizza and arcade building (basically Chuck E Cheese) where they are captured by evil next door neighbor Sid who blows toys up for fun. Here, Buzz learns through a TV advert and a fall down the stairs that he is a toy after all in quite a powerful and emotional scene. Buzz goes insane while Woody tries to escape with him. Woody realizes that Sid i going to blow him and Buzz up on the same day that Andy is supposed to move house. So Woody hitches a plan using some of Sid's poor toys who fell victim to Sid's evil experiments. Woody uses his string voice to warn Sid about the toys before coming to life to say the words ""So play nice!"" in one of the greatest movie scenes of all time. Buzz finally comes to his senses and him and Woody manage to get to the moving truck in time. So, anyway Toy Story is an animated masterpiece which will always be remembered, not only for it's stunning visuals but it's great story and characters.",

A classic that I keep watching over and over again - mostly synchronized to local languages. Still, guys who did the voice-overs did a great job. A rather simple story, but spiced with so much details. It also covers many views of childhood, kids' imagination, family and yes - it brings messages about friendship, jealousy and trust. Every single toy got character and is equipped with specific character attributes: one big toy is actually sensitive, another is grumpy and cynical, then there is a toy not realizing it's actually a toy and so on. There is not a single boring part. Houmor suits both kids' and adults' sense and there is a plenty of intelligent details about toys features.

546,20 November 2017,Josh_The_Critic,10, To Infinity and Beyond!,"This is the film that started one of the best animation companies, Pixar, in 1995. Toy Story is one of those revolutionary movies! It's the first full-length computer animated film ever! Toy Story inspired companies to make animated movies in it's style, even Disney, whom was struggling after it's Renaissance in the 90's, was attempting in Pixar's technique. Now Pixar could've just created a mediocre movie, and still get some points for it's technological achievements. But Pixar didn't do that, in fact, they made one of the best animated films ever made. Even though Toy Story isn't a 100% original idea, they made an excellent variation of it and it had it's identity. All of the acting is perfect! Tom Hanks as Sheriff Woody is a perfect casting choice, along with Tim Allen as Buzz, and every single other character. I loved Tom Hanks performance in movies such as Forrest Gump(1996) and The Green Mile(1999) but honestly him as Woody is his most memorable performance, even though he's perfect in those movies also. This film also had some emotional moments, helping Pixar get an identity of having those kind of moments in their movies. The emotional moments are nothing compared to the sequels of Toy Story, but they are definitely good. My only issue is the animation, for it didn't all age too well...especially the humans. This may be the reason why the main characters in the older Pixar movies in particular are animals, creatures, or inanimate objects(referring to toys). Even with it's aged animation, it could surprisingly be better than some animated movies later on...specifically direct to DVD movies like Norm of the North(2016) or Foodfight(2012), which had a budget of 65 million dollars...all of that money was wasted. Despite it's few flaws, Toy Story is a magnificent movie that pretty much everyone has at least seen once! I give this movie: 9.7/10=10/10 overall",

Andy alone has a lot to him, having to move and losing his most beloved toys in the process.

I loved how all the toys are like a big family, with Woody being like a leader. As for Buzz Lightyear, I thought he was going to be really tall, but it turns out, he's shorter than he appeared. It was hilarious how Buzz believed he was a ""space ranger"". Also, Woody and Buzz sort of reminded me of Tawni and Sonny from the show Sonny With a Chance when they first met. Both Buzz and Sonny were ""the new kid"" who got accepted by almost everyone, and both Woody and Tawni were the only one who didn't accept the ""new kid"" and got jealous (but eventually learned to accept the ""new kid"").

567,8 February 2009,alalistaa,10, Best of the pixar movies,"I am a big fan of all of Pixars movies and have seen all of them at the cinema, however for me this stands head and shoulders above the rest (including this years brilliant WallE). I watched it again recently and despite my age was pissing myself with laughter. This is mainly down to the characters who are so fresh. The banter between woody and Buzz is terrific (""YOU ARE A TOY!!!"") and the other characters are also brilliant, especially ,for me, the bitter, angry and cynical Mr potato head , who lends a slightly darker more adult edge to this film compared to the Pixar movies to come ,as well as Sid his dog and the mutilated toys he has created. It is after all the only pixar movie rated parental guidance, i think which lets the emotions of the characters be more human in the shape of jealousy, pride and competitiveness. The central ideas of toys being alive when you cant see them is probably their best idea to date just in sheer amount of imagination and the amount of opportunity and possibility it creates (their is after all a sequel) and does kind of become a template for later. This definitely provided a lifeline for Disney who had seriously passed its golden age, and were starting to lose their reputation of quality and connection with its younger and older audience. With Lasseter moving to head of creative output at Disney, hopefully he will put them back on track also.",
568,24 January 2010,breakingmadkaty,10, Great Movie,"Still one of the best computer generated movies, great story, voice work, and the animation still holds up after all these years. A terrific movie for all ages. Tom Hanks delivers a believable character in Woody, and this is clearly some of Tim Allen's best work in his career, if not his BEST, he often just plays boring frustrated dad characters, it gets really old, and he doesn't have any energy, but his voice works as Buzz Lightyear. Altogether the movie is funny, the story's well crafted, enjoyable to watch over and over again. Very much advised to watch this over the much overrated The Incredibles, this one's actually great. Not average but for some reason believed to be great which The Incredibles surely isn't, but that's another review. If you haven't seen it, buy it or rent it. It'll be worth your money and time.",

It was released on the back of the critically acclaimed (and box office hits): Beauty and The Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. Because of this (and Toy Story being Disney's first collaboration with Pixar), there must have been considerable pressure on the picture to succeed. The idea of toys coming to life is a seemingly sure-fire winner for a family film. However, this could easily have been handled badly. This is not the case with Toy Story. ",

As this movie came out, I was two years old at the time and my parents, being the best people ever, took me out to see this. Although I don't remember seeing this as a child, I still watch it to this day as a 19 year old. I only wished I was a little older to understand what was going on.That day finally came! The story was great and let me just say that Pixar picked the smartest idea ever to make a movie. ""After we create this awesome movie, we should sell all the toys and get even more money!"". This movie has influenced me in so many ways. It inspired me to go into the design field and I have stuck with that to this day. It made me want to keep all of my toys and realize that they will still have sentimental value. This movie is not only good for children, adults will love it.

625,15 October 2021,sabinb-37627,10, The Bestest Pixar Movie On Earth,"I am reviewing the movie Toy Story, the first Pixar film from 1995. The main character is a cowboy doll named Woody who is Andy's favorite toy until Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger toy came in which Andy got for his birthday, who later becomes Woody's best friend. The bad guy is Sid, a human teenage boy who tortures toys until in the end the other toys and Woody teach him a lesson to play nice. The toys come alive when no humans are in the room. The story is about a cowboy doll named Woody who is Andy's favorite toy and has other toys who are his friends: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, Rex, Hamm, and Bo Peep. Later Buzz Lightyear a space ranger toy comes in and takes his place. They originally were against each other and later Woody knocks Buzz out the window by accident. Woody and Buzz are now lost at the Dinoco Gas station but head to pizza planet. They later in the end follow Andy and his mom to the new house and on Christmas, Woody and Buzz are now best friends and heard Andy got a puppy (which he named it Buster in the sequel). I love Toy Story. It was the first ever computer-animated and Pixar feature film. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen both nailed the roles of Woody and Buzz respectively. It is funny and hilarious for most of the movie. Woody makes a good protagonist and Buzz makes a good deuteragonist. Sid, the film's main antagonist is very sinister and makes a good villain, and finally in the end he learns to play nice, thanks to Woody and the other broken toys. Hannah, Sid's younger sister unlike his older evil brother, is nice, kind and caring. The follow ups are also great especially for Toy Story 2, which was the first ever computer-animated sequel which was released in 1999. I enjoyed the movie. It's one of the best computer-animated movies ever made, as well as the first one ever. Pixar did a great job making the movie. It's a great movie for kids, teenagers and adults.",

If anyone has these pictures could you please reply? I also believe that Toy Story 1 was the best movie because of the cool graphic's.

Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Hamm, Rex, Slinky, Mr. Potato Head, the Green Army Men, Andy, Sid, and the entire toy community are all fleshed out characters that always have something witty or insightful to say about the situations they find themselves in. All in all, ""Toy Story"" will always hold a special place in my heart as it was the first Pixar film I saw and held the most immediately memorable characters.

What other animated flick references the likes of films such as 'The Shining', 'Star Wars', 'Alien' or 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'? This film encompasses so many wonderful things about growing up. Birthday parties with your friends, spontaneous trips to eat pizza and play arcade games, Christmas with the family and, of course, the thrill of imagining up an incredible world in which you and your toys can live and interact. Toy Story's characters are amazing, its animation was (and still is) stunning and its themes of friendship, loyalty and learning to get along with those around you make it a film in which both children and adults can both relate to and learn from.",

Don't understand the likes and dislikes but willing to accept all criticism. My own personal review may be liked or may be disliked. The clearness and accurate manner for beautiful taste in dual role models for example Sid the evil kid whom abuses toys and Andy the kid who doesn't like to play rough. However, Sid's sister is quite an opposite to Sid as well; she being a girl and has a love for tea parties with her closest doll Friends.

It was the first one to actually catch my attention, as well as the first that I actually enjoyed. Nearly two decades later, it still holds up in my eyes. While I still occasionally watch other features from my childhood, none of them ever take me back like Toy Story manages to do every single time, and while my opinion of a lot of them changed over the years, Toy Story has always been ten stars, and one of the few I've grown to appreciate even more so as my tastes matured.",

676,26 April 2017,vharrington-53006,7, Film Review of Toy Story,"The movie Toy Story is an animated film about the life of toys and their struggle to be kept by children. The story starts with a child named Andy whose favorite toy is a cowboy sheriff named, Woody (voice by Tom Hanks), and their inseparable bond. For years, Woody is Andy's number one toy, until one birthday Andy is given a new play pal, Buzz Lightyear, (voice by Tim Allen). Immediately, Woody is aware that Buzz is taking his place as the favorite toy and becomes jealous. Woody's plan to get rid of Buzz eventually leads to the both of them being far away from home and in the hands of Sid, the child toy terrorizer who lives next door. In the end, the two work together and make it back to Andy's house. Woody realizes that he will not always be Andy's favorite and becomes friends with Buzz. The overall theme of the film is accepting change and understand that sometimes it is a good thing. Woody was so worried about being replaced that he did not see a good person (toy rather) in Buzz. The next-door neighbor kid, Sid, also learned a valuable lesson in this film. He spent all of his time torturing and destroying toys as a way of having fun, but finally got what was coming to him when he seen that toys come to life. Another teachable moment was with Mr. Potato Head; one of Andy's toys, and his trust issues with Woody. Throughout the film, Mr. Potato Head constantly lacked faith in Woody and always gave a negative comment about what Woody wanted to do. Once Woody and Buzz teamed up, the other toys and Mr. Potato Head were convinced that Woody was right. Out of everyone, Buzz learned the biggest lesson; never give up on your dreams. Buzz did not comprehend that he was not really a space ranger and could not r fly. When Woody told Buzz that he was just a toy, Buzz did not believe it until he saw the commercial. Yet, he still got to ride his rocket and fly through the skies. Watching Toy Story and all of the messages that it displayed reminded me of one of my favorite films Dead Presidents. Everyone is going through the same journey, but have a different perspective on the situation. All of the characters have a diverse outcome of the lesson and they take an important life learning experience with them. The film was strictly a kid's movie, so the lighting was very bright and colorful. This worked well with the theme, because what easily influences kids are the things they see and hear. Having those cheerful images and giving a positive insight helps the children understand messages in a fun way. Many of the angles in the film were close ups of the characters faces, giving you great detail of the animated work done by the editors. Every expression was shown as if they were real people, and you could almost feel what the characters were going through. Andy's happy face, Sid's mean face and Buzz's sad face; all right there so you could relate to the emotion. I think it is cute and inspiring to young children to receive a good message in any film. Animated films have always been seen as funny and playful, but they do teach a lesson at some point. It may not be major, but it tells the audience something that they want to put out there, and most of the time that one message can grow into many different opinions; not everyone thinks the same.",
