3,5 August 2008,EijnarAmadeus,9, A Legendary Comedy,"With Billy Wilder's steady direction, the great casting, and Wilder/Diamond's sparkling script Some Like It Hot has become one of the most enjoyed comedies of cinema history. The story itself is pure comedy gold; the unhappy jazz-musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are witness to the St. Valentine massacre in 1929 and flees from Chicago with an all-girl-band who's headed for Miami, dressed up as ""Josephine"" and ""Daphne"". Soon both are hooked on Sugar Kane (Marylin Monroe), the band's lead singer - but things gets more complicated when arrived in Miami, Daphne attracts a elderly playboy and the gangster of Chicago arrives at the Floria-hotel to have a mafia-meeting.",v

5,17 February 2017,mark.waltz,10, Many have tried but few have succeeded in coming close to matching it.,"There are four Oscar worthy performances in this Billy Wilder comedy classic. Marilyn, Jack, Tony and Joe all shine in the beaches of Florida where sweet Sue and her band, featuring luscious Miss Monroe and two real dogs perform in an all female band. The problem is that the dogs aren't real women: they're musicians hiding from the mob, having witnessed a St. Valentine's Day massacre style hit. Mob head George Raft wants them dead, so what's the best way to hide? Dress up as a woman of course!",e
6,4 January 2014,silva-w-pius,9, Marilyn Monroe. Enough said.,"""Movies should be like amusement parks"" filmmaker Billy Wilder once said ""People should go to them to have fun"". So If Some Like It Hot was an amusement park: it would Thorpe Park, mixed in with Legoland, added with a dash of Disney land. Some Like It Hot is the granddaddy of comedies, the Godfather of laughs and the Mike Tyson of punch lines. Heck! Watching this film is like getting into the ring with Muhammad Ali, as you're constantly hit with fast paced gags. Even when you're least expecting it you're hit with a punch line so funny it leaves your side aching, or a piece of slapstick comedy that leaves your eyes running. Even the fade out line has been regarded as the funniest and most famous in history. Once you hear it, you'll guarantee never ever, ever to forget it. Trust me, it's hilarious! ",w

On the journey they get to know the other girls and as Joe talks to singer Sugar and learns how she hopes to meet a bespectacled millionaire with a yacht rather than the usual succession on no-good saxophone players (Joe plays the Sax).

8,18 April 2001,gbrumburgh,10," Billy Wilder's screwball masterpiece with Curtis, Lemmon and the immortal Marilyn handed the best comedy roles of their careers.","Admittedly biased, ""Some Like It Hot"" can certainly stand on its own merit with or without my thunderous round of applause.  More than a decade ago, I had the privilege of performing both the Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon roles in ""Sugar,"" the musical adaptation of ""Some Like It Hot"" which originally starred Tony Roberts, Robert Morse and Elaine Joyce on Broadway in the 70s. Though it hardly compares to the film's original (how could it???), the musical nevertheless is still a big hit with live audiences.  I can't remember ever having a better time on stage than I did with ""Sugar,"" and it's all due to the irrepressible talents that instigated it all.",r

11,20 April 2011,moonspinner55,9," Runnin' Wild with Curtis, Lemmon, and Monroe...","Brazen, rambunctious, lascivious comedy, expertly written by Billy Wilder (who also directed) and I.A.L. Diamond from a story by R. Thoeren and Michael Logan. High-spirited slapstick, with both sharp and soft edges, involves two luckless Prohibition-era musicians in Chicago who inadvertently witness the St. Valentine's Day massacre; they take it on the lam after disguising themselves as women, becoming part of an all-female jazz combo! Hilarious film still delivers the goods, from Tony Curtis' Cary Grant impression (to win over chanteuse Marilyn Monroe) to Jack Lemmon inexplicably falling for a wacky elderly millionaire (the priceless Joe E. Brown). Only in the more subdued seduction scenes between Curtis and Monroe does the film's pacing flag; otherwise, boffo entertainment. ***1/2 from ****",3

14,2 March 2008,bobsgrock,10, An outrageous and hilarious comedy.,"Billy Wilder goes the limits in this outrageous and very funny comedy about two musicians going undercover as women to avoid the mob. It is a ridiculous premise, but Wilder and Diamond's script perfectly balances the comedy with scenes of love and romance. Curtis and Monroe have great chemistry together, and Lemmon is superb as the comedy relief in the ""serious"" scenes with George Raft. Even these are something to laugh at, but the film is not to be taken seriously; just to be laughed at. It has been almost fifty years since it was released and people still laugh at it. I have seen it three or four times and it is still as funny as seeing it for the first time. That is the true test of a comedy and Some Like It Hot passes with flying colors. A true comedy classic all the way around.",3
15,2 January 2020,Prismark10,10, Some Like It Hot,I always tell my kids. Remember the last line of this movie. One day you might find yourself on a quiz show and the final line to this movie is the answer to the one million pound question.,8
16,29 July 2006,claudette-crivelli,10, The Perfect Comedy,"Why a man would want to marry another man? asks Tony Curtis, Security! Jack Lemmon replays without missing a beat. Clearly he had put the question to himself before and had arrived to a perfectly sensible conclusion. Everything in this gem of a movie had been thought so cleverly and as it turned out so prophetically, that the world of our three characters, a world of prohibition and gang wars could be today and more than likely will be tomorrow. Billy Wilder analyzes human nature with an acid eye and a glorious panache for underlining our most endearing features. Our frailties. Marilyn Monroes is at her pick, the sadness in her eyes a startling metaphor in a comedy about wanting. Tony Curtis with an Eve Arden's pout is so beautiful, so charming, imitating Cary Grant and trying to be himself that, in my mind he'll be always be in a frock. And, of course, Jack Lemmon, throwing himself into the part, body and should. Only perfection can allow to end its course with a line like ""Nobody's perfect""",3
17,22 March 2010,planktonrules,8, A lot of fun and one of the best final lines in film history...,"This is a wonderfully entertaining film that has to have one of the best final scenes in movie history--seeing Joe E. Brown and Jack Lemmon in this scene is truly delightful. However, I do wonder if perhaps, maybe, the film is a tiny bit overrated--especially since it is now ranked relatively high on IMDb's Top 250 list. It's an exceptional film...I just don't see it as quite THAT exceptional.",/
18,12 October 2012,ferguson-6,8, Jell-O on Springs,"Greetings again from the darkness. Billy Wilder's classic was the latest in the comedy series sponsored by Dallas Film Society and Dallas Morning News. It is almost always ranked as one of the top comedy films of all-time, and often the best ever. While that's a bit higher than I would rank it, there is little doubt that it has earned its enduring place in cinematic history. To fully understand the impact of the film, it helps to remind yourself of the times ... it was filmed more than 50 years ago. What we might call tame today, was incredibly risqué and daring for the times.",?

20,6 December 2013,The-Sarkologist,8, Had me in stitches,"This is the first Marilyn Monroe movie that I have seen and I must say that I thought it was quite funny. Monroe, though, doesn't have the screen presence that most people seem to claim that she has. In fact, I wasn't really sure if it was her when she first appeared. Okay, this movie is more focused on Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis, and they actually have more presence than she does, but she does stand out.",e

Rather than putting original thought into the process, one idea that he constantly comes back to is the ""Top 10"" list. Spending hours upon hours discussing the best horrors, the best musicals, the best number ones of the 1980s, these lists vary amongst a million different ideas. One of the most popular though is the Top 100 Films of All Time. This list tends to contain some of the all time greats and all too often it sadly has ""Star Wars"" at number one. One film which always features though, and remains perhaps the funniest comedy of all time is Billy Wilder's ""Some Like It Hot"".

25,17 February 2006,Lady_Targaryen,9, Marilyn Monroe and her bosom companions!,"''Some Like It Hot'' is the best movie with Marilyn Monroe already made! When I was deciding which movie from Marilyn's box I was going to watch, ''Some Like it Hot'' was the one which I payed less attention of them: the cover is not beautiful as ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes '' or ''How to Marry a Millionaire'' and the fact that the movie was black and white made it less appealing to me. Anyway, I decided to watch and I don't regret it at all: I had a lot of fun with the story!:) ( And by the way, I saw how handsome Jamie Lee Curtis' father, Tony Curtis, was.)",t

28,3 January 2005,sol-,10, My brief review of the film,"A delightful cross-dressing comedy, this was one of the first of its type and it still is one of the funniest. It is very cleverly written, impeccably acted, particularly by Joe E. Brown, and features excellent chemistry between the two leads. There are parallels in the film to actual events and attitudes that existed in the 1920s, giving the film a historical insight as an extra virtue. The film works so well not just because of its historical parallels but also because it spoofs gangster films and not just the cross-dressing joke. Overall it is a wonderful film that sparkles along to its glitzy Academy Awarding winning costume design.",r

Whether an incident were to be filmed from a story and its screenplay form written directly for the screen or an adaptation of a Novel, a Short Story or a Stage Play, they are an important element of formulating our image of our World. Right or wrong, it is a fact of life and one that we must learn to live with.",v
30,20 May 2006,jem132,10, Gender-bending fun!..,"...But there's more to 'Some Like It Hot' than just it's cross-dressing element. This is a terrific comedy farce that may just well be the funniest film ever made (AFI certainly agrees with me, naming 'Some Like It Hot' as the No.1 comedy of all time in their list).",

32,4 November 2002,funkyfry,9, Monroe shows off her real comedy talent,"Comedy set in the late 20s/early 30s features stereotypes of the era -- bombshell torch singer (Monroe, of course), hard-as-nails gangster boss (Raft, of course), and go-getter protagonists (Lemmon and Curtis, of course).  Everything is spoofed in a light way.  Very nice photography. Some of the jokes are flat, but the visual humor can't fail -- especially Lemmon in his crossdressing disguise, which he seems to grow more and more into until his final scene where he and Joe E. Brown seem to be ""sailing into the sunset"" together.  As Joe says ""nobody's perfect.""  But this movie's close.",
33,3 December 2016,Hitchcoc,9, Tony Curtis Bugs Me; I Love Him in This Fillm,"Jack Lemmon has the most bewildered, frantic sensibility about him. And in this film he is able to use it to the Nth degree. Tony Curtis has always been a puzzle to me, but the chemistry that he exhibits with Lemmon makes this the biggest hoot of the fifties. Throw in Marilyn Monroe, with her dizzy blond routine, but with charm, and gentleness, and you have an unstoppable comedy. With the men in drag attempting to invade the place where the girls are and Joe E. Brown (a very strange man to say the least) and a great script and it really works. I will never forget the final line of the movie as Lemon sits next to Brown with the most incredulous look. See this if you haven't it will make you laugh from beginning to end.",
34,1 January 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Hilarious comedy, with brilliant performances and great writing","Some Like it Hot is a truly delightful and hilarious comedy, complete with brilliant performances and great writing. This is the sort of comedy that has the desire of sex as part of the plot, and while there have been films that have ignored this, this film embraces it to stellar effect. The plot is brilliant in construction and almost elaborate, about two men escape after witnessing a mob fight, and join an all female band disguised as women, and this is where the film gets complicated. The direction from Billy Wilder is spot on, the cinematography is beautiful and the music is gorgeous. Other than the performances, the real treasure comes in the script, a mother load of classically delicious lines that are not only funny but intelligent as well. The performances are note perfect, while Tony Curtis and Jack Curtis give truly wonderful performances, it is the beautiful Marilyn Monroe in a deliciously seductive and sly performance who steals the acting honours. All in all, a truly wonderful comedy, right up there with comedies like Duck Soup and Night At the Opera as one of the best comedies of all time. 10/10 Bethany Cox",
35,4 April 2006,anton_abrahams,10, The ultimate desert island movie,I was never one of those kids who watched Star Wars over 100 times (actually just once or twice) and find that even the moves I rate in my top twenty can only bear watching a couple of times a year. This is the exception.,
36,24 November 2012,inkblot11,10," Hotter than hot, a volcano of laughter erupts at every view! The ultimate ""feel good"" flick","In 1929 Chicago, gangsters rule. Especially Spats Colombo (George Raft) who runs a speak-easy in the back area of a funeral home. That's where bass player, Jerry (Jack Lemmon) and saxophonist Joe (Tony Curtis) have gotten their latest gigs. On payday, though, the place is raided, with many folks arrested. J and J manage to flee, however, on the fire escape. Needing a car a day later, to drive to a job in Urbana, these two musicians unhappily end up at a garage where they witness the St. Valentine's Day massacre. Spats wants to gun them down, too, but they evade bullets and make it out when sirens approach. However, since Spats knows who they are, there will be nowhere to hide. That is, unless they disguise themselves as women and join an all-girl band on the way to Florida! Ha! Yes, Josephine and Daphne, in lipstick and heels, are reborn. Almost immediately, there are problems. Daphne's bosom becomes detached while the leader of the band, Sweet Sue, senses there is something different about these gals. However, worst of all, there is a gorgeous dame, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) who sings and plays the ukelele. Daphne has to keep saying ""I'm a girl, I'm a girl whenever Sugar waltzes by while Joe is equally smitten. When they finally make it to Miami, Daphne becomes the object of affection for a rich millionaire, Osgood (Joe E. Brown). If Osgood succeeds in courting ""her"", she could become his ninth wife. Then, Joe, itching to romance Sugar, disguises himself at off hours as another rich boy, Shell Oil Junior, and uses Osgood's yacht to find some alone time with Miss Kane. What a tangle of emotions, especially when Daphne can't dampen Osgood's ardor! Also, before long, the mobsters hold a convention in, you guessed it, Miami, with Spats front and center. What are two guys, er gals, er whatever, going to do? This hotter than hot film has been ranked the best comedy of all time and with good reason. It is downright hilarious, with a clever script of great one-liners and much physical comedy. The cast is likewise topnotch, with Lemmon and Curtis, a duo of humorous hijinks, leading the way. Monroe, too, is funny, touching, and drop dead gorgeous. Brown turns in one the most memorable character turns ever while the Raft and the rest have the audience rolling, too. Sets, costumes, and the fresh direction complete a masterpiece of mirth. Hot, cold, or lukewarm, whatever the day turns out to be, if you need the lift of laughter, this is choice number one.",

38,20 April 1999,bnm81510,10, As hot as it gets,"A Comedy that has it all, and lacks absolutely nothing. ""Nobody's perfect"" may be an inherent truism, but ""Some Like it Hot"" is a definite somebody in the universe of cinema, thus it IS perfect in every sense. Swing, sex and slapstick, (three words that immediately come to mind when trying to describe it) , are a mix so delicious, so fruitful in its possibilities that one cannot imagine a film which can live up to them, and yet this one does. Marilyn, her trademark, displeasingly infantile voice aside, is a bombshell of thermonuclear dimensions, whose powers of titillation will not expire so long as there are hormones and/or Viagra. The sexual content, for socio-historical reasons cannot be as explicit as we've come to expect, but there's still plenty of it, from Monroe's see-through outfit to the double entendre worthy of the Farelli Brothers (""What do I do if it's an emergency ? - Pull the emergency break!"" ), including overtly gay themes that have a cult following of their own. The Lemmon/Curtis duo operates with gleeful, unrestrained vitality that can only be likened to Chaplin in his heyday. Though not a Musical, the combustive energy of this movie is so stimulating it almost makes you get up and dance.",

41,19 August 2013,tavm,9," Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot is still among the greatest movie comedies, if not the greatest","I've only seen this movie once before on the late show when I lived in Jacksonville, FL, with my aunts. I remember thinking this was pretty funny. Now that I've watched this on DVD with my mom (who had never seen this before), it's even more funny than I remembered it. I mean, seeing Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon try to convincingly play women in order to escape some gangsters, especially in front of the actual females they're surrounded with, can be pretty funny since they don't really look anything similar to them but I guess the fact that many of them do drink might have been a factor. And then there's Marilyn Monroe, looking as luminous as one expects but also one of the most charismatic of actresses especially considering her off-screen troubles that seemed to affect everyone involved including director Billy Wilder. Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's screenplay just cackles with such great lines. Oh, and I also loved Joe E. Brown's performance as the millionaire that falls for Lemmon's character. His seemed to be the best one here, even better than Lemmon's who was the only player to get an Oscar nomination. And while George Raft and Pat O'Brien played their typed roles of gangster and cop, they played them well enough to still deliver the goods. In summary, I'm not sure if I agree with the AFI listing this as No. 1 among great comedies, but Some Like It Hot is still one of the most entertaining of them, that's for sure!",
42,12 October 2010,Boba_Fett1138,8, It helped to change the genre.,"Although you can still somewhat describe this movie being somewhat of a screwball comedy, it's also really a movie that has more hints of a more modern type of comedy in it. The overall comedy and approach of it all and the story feels more matured and seriously put together, as if it was a movie out of a far more serious and respected genre, such as a drama or a thriller. It makes me sort of see ""Some Like It Hot"" as the first 'modern' comedy.",
43,20 June 2021,kevin_robbins,7, Monroe should receive credit for coming across as highly relatable and someone easy to root for,"Some Like it Hot (1959) is a movie I recently watched on Amazon Prime. The storyline involves two traveling band members that are being hunted down after witnessing a murder by a gang. The band members decide to dress as girls and join a traveling female band. Their new bandmember is a knockout that is going to make hiding their identity a challenge. This movie is directed by Billy Wilder (Sabrina) and stars Marilyn Monroe (Gentlemen Prefer Blonds), Tony Curtis (Spartacus), Jack Lemmon (Grumpy Old Men) and Pat O'Brien (Angels with Dirty Faces). The storyline for this is super cheesy but has some rollercoaster twists and turns as Lemmon and Curtis hide their identity. Monroe should receive credit for coming across as highly relatable and someone easy to root for. The scenarios are ridiculous but entertaining and it is fun to watch this movie unfold. I'd score this a better than average 7/10 and highly recommend watching this.",

Brown, George Raft: Delightfully funny comedy referring to the expression and appreciation of jazz music as well as the dilemma at hand. The title may also refer too a man who isn't what he claims and a woman who isn't intelligent enough to know the difference. It is a laugh loaded joy starring Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon as two musicians who witness a murder and flee for their lives. They disguise themselves as women and blend in with an all girl band and board a train. Curtis falls for Marilyn Monroe while Lemmon becomes the centre of affection of an old lout who is at the resort that the band marks as their next stop. Clever and surprising with fantastic witty dialogue that ranks among Billy Wilder's greatest work, which includes Sunset Boulevard, Sabrina and Double Indemnity all of which arrive within different genres. Curtis and Lemmon provide hilarious chemistry with Monroe absolutely ravishing as the dumb blonde bit. George Raft plays the mob boss like a pro as he and his posse seek out the leads unknowing what awaits in an ominous birthday cake. Joe E. Brown plays a rich playboy whom immediately takes to Lemmon and delivers one of the funniest closing lines in film history. Observant view of hardship of women that heats as one of the funniest comedies ever made. Score: 10 / 10",

64,5 June 2012,sashank_kini-1,9, Steamy but not sleazy and hilarious but not brainless rom-com that mayn't have gained its legendary status without its irresistible cast,"Marilyn Monroe is the greatest proof that an actress can stimulate burning passion among men just by talking; watch those brilliant lips move and those lovely teeth - don't they excite you, tantalize you till you fall off your couch? Monroe should've got those aphrodisiacs patented. Then comes those lovely puppies that adorn her bosom, and they stand out proudly, flaunting their fullness in her revealing gowns. It's a wonder 'Sweet' Sue missed that; everything in Marilyn screams out 'sex!' and Monroe does a feat by layering Sugar with creaminess, nuttiness and sexiness so she's worth much more than those dumb desperate harebrained bimbos. Sugar has a mind and a heart - she may be dumb and gullible, but she's certainly not vain; she doesn't even understand her own eccentricities sometimes, like always falling for bespectacled Saxophone players who only have one thing on their minds. She loves to drink anytime, anywhere and knows she doesn't have much of a voice but can use her charm to please anyone. This makes her unique, and we don't just gawk at them puppies all the time. Marilyn brings steadiness to her role, and she never lets go of Sugar in her scenes, in spite floundering her lines and creating a fiasco on sets. Her 'I want to be loved by you' is candid, hummable and touching. The high key lighting on her makes her ethereal. This is one performance that will not be forgotten. Modern rom-com actresses like Katherine Heigl, Jennifer Aniston and some lesser known ones can't bring such sizzle on screen because they take their characters too lightly - Aniston talks like a female county sheriff while Heigl (though I haven't seen much of her) is very clichéd and dull. Megan Fox unfortunately is too hot to make an impact as a true actress; she's all ogle-ogle.",

To date, I've seen three of his films {the other two being 'Double Indemnity (1944)' and 'Sunset Blvd. (1950)'}, and every single one absolutely brims with class, a triumph of witty writing and procificient direction. Even though 'Some Like It Hot (1959)' was voted #1 in the American Film Institute's '100 Years 100 Laughs,' I didn't initially consider it the sort of film that I would enjoy. After all, who wants to watch a movie about men dressing up as women? Needless to say, I had completely underestimated the talent of both Wilder and his terrific cast, and 'Some Like It Hot' revealed itself to be a very funny film, indeed. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon star as two jazz musicians who witness the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929 and are forced to flee Chicago posing as two members of an all-girls band.

Wilder did everything to get up the noses of the censors, and was clever enough to get away with all of it. In 1959 men dressing and behaving like ladies...wearing ladies clothes...was dangerous ground to tread on. And the many sub-plots that this brought about were also ""no go"" areas. He succeeded just like the T.V. Classic Seinfeld...when they declared ""not that there's anything wrong with that"" when they did there great ""sexual preference"" episode. In the case of Some Like It Hot...we need to remember...this was 1959. Munroe was always difficult to work with...continually turning up late, and being obviously neurotic.

72,29 July 2006,pyrocitor,10, A comedy milestone way ahead of its time,Some Like It Hot,
73,11 December 2020,jayjaycee,10, Naughty and intelligently raunchy comedy,"""Some Like It Hot"" is a 1959 comedy directed by Billy Wilder starring Marilyn Monroe and Tony Curtis.
⚪
All in all, this Billy Wilder classic heats up the room with its distinct and extremely raunchy kind of humour, defined by subtle to obvious sexual innuendos, wonderful running gags, verbal altercations and shrewd punchlines, and thanks to versatile performances by Curtis and Lemon, as well as a divine role played by the goddess Marilyn Monroe, it becomes a salacious, in multiple ways hilarious and excellently written comedy full of brilliant ideas and turns, ingeniously conceptualised erotic situations, as well as a humour as scandalous as it is superb.
⚪
Since it has become extremely freezing outside, I thought I'd make myself comfortable and cosy by watching a Marilyn Monroe classic my brother's best friend has spoken highly of in the past. As it turns out, she was absolutely right with her praise for this is film, as it is indeed a brilliant and anything but average comedy, quite the contrary, it is outstanding! I mean, it must have been scandalous back in the day, for it openly deals with then tabooed themes like cross-dressing and homosexuality, but without dragging them through the mire. Undeniably, it uses it as a comedic element, but, what positively surprised me, it treats it with a lot of respect, nevertheless. Just as I thought the early eighties classic ""Tootsie"" was revolutionary with its unconventional subject matter, I saw that Tony Curtis and Jack Lemon pulled a similar stunt already twenty-three years before Dustin Hoffmann: As the musicians Joe and Jerry involuntarily witness a multiple murder by the hands of the mafia, they dress up as women in order to join an all-female music ensemble headed for Florida, where they hope to seek safety from the mob as well as a fortune, but as soon as they arrive, it gets extremely complicated. The thing is, screenwriters Billy Wilder and I.A.L Diamond already had a terrific premise, but how they furtherly elaborate it is what really deserves the praise. As if it was the easiest thing to do, they conceptualised marvellously realistic characters and gave them all a sufficiently brilliant personality. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemon, playing three and two roles, respectively, shine like stars in here. Like, Curtis plays the saxophonist Joe, the lady Josephine and, later, even pretends to be snotty the millionaire Shell Oil Junior, and, no kidding, he plays all three characters masterfully. Also, despite having one role less, Lemon delivers in an equally superb way, and both of them are utterly convincing as women. Oh, and then there is the epitome of sexiness, Marilyn Monroe, playing the role of the adorable Sugar Kane. Honestly, that was the first time ever I have seen her in a movie, and even though it is probably the most unoriginal thing to say, she was downright gorgeous. I am aware that she isn't probably the most talented actress and singer in the world, and reportedly wasn't the brightest or most reliable person either, but holy cow, she was a complete queen, nevertheless. What she lacked in competence, she made up with her charisma and her sheer presence. Honestly, I know that she is a myth-enshrouded woman to this day and still a sex-symbol for modern generations, and that it hence might appear that I only repeat what is generally said about her, but everything they say about her is simply true, and I would be lying if I didn't agree on that. In her own iconic way, she graces the screen with her charismatic presence and her unconventional line delivery, and I assure you, she is absolutely mesmerizing in every scene she is in. Like, the two male leads are already displaying top-notch acting, but she still somehow manages to steal the show all the time. Together, the three legends dominate the screen with their distinct performances, but as crazy as it sounds, that is by far not all this film has to offer. Aside from the magnificent acting, there is also a phenomenal screenplay that is equally excellent. As already mentioned above, the subject matter it deals with is unconventionally taboo-breaking, but it is the manner in which it does it that amazes me. The humour is just wonderfully eclectic and combines many different types of comedy to one hell of a mix. From cleverly written dialogues, over subtle to obvious sexual innuendos to naughty punchlines you have got it all. I was amazed that many of the jokes were even allowed and not censored, since it was the late fifties. Like, all the conversations are ambiguous, full of (homo)sexual tension and nearly scandalous jokes. Furthermore, it implements influences of slapstick and screwball comedy and becomes a lovely homage to both sub-genres, all the while not forgetting to be something on itself. The romances are fervent, the humour is always on point and it never becomes boring or runs out of ideas. What also surprised me to see is how the two disguised men experience sexual harassment and how the film expresses obvious criticism to it. This film defines the term hilarity in its own magnificent way and sticks at nothing, social norms included. Seriously, it has got everything a perfect comedy needs, it is marvellously acted, outstandingly written, as well as revolutionary and way ahead of its time. Like, in the final scene, one character comes out as bisexual, and if that isn't absolutely cool, I don't know what is. Magnificent!",

This is now the first and only film I have seen with Marilyn Monroe as well as directed by Billy Wilder. The hype on these two seem to be correct and I look forward to checking out more from both. However, the real success of the film is the portrayal of our two leads by Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis. Both bring a fantastic comedic element to the story and play their roles to perfection. So many films afterwards have taken the general plot linetwo people see a gang shooting and run away/change identities to not get killed only to end up running into the mobsters coincidentally in the city they have relocated to, and remade it. None of them come close to the level of achievement that this one has, way back in 1959.",

There is a slice of '30s gangster pictures, a large wedge of '30s/'40s screwball comedy and the entire film is set during the 1920s prohibition era. Yet, despite the historical influences, the film feels eerily modern.

When I want to sit looking at a good film, ""Some like it hot"" is a very good option. This comedy had real ingredients of the period of dry law in US, which gave a nice and reasonable plot. Marilyn Monroe and Tony Curtis were great, simply one of the best looking couple of the former cinema. George Raft acted in the role of gangster. I do not think that this role was difficult for Raft, someone that during the 50s was always working in nightclubs and casinos in Havana linked to the foreign and internal maffia at that time, so it was easy to him to do what he used to do in his real life. Pat O'Brien acted not as a priest as usual but as a good inspector-detective. But better than all this was the acting of Jack Lemmon and Joe E. Brown (whom we used to call ""Big mouth"" or ""Bocasa"" in Spanish), both gave the necessary ingredients to make this comedy one of the greatest of all time. The film is good from the beginning until the end, but certain scenes were simply the funniest, one of them when Curtis and Lemmon were having a chat with the nearly naked ladies in the train at night, the other one when Marilyn met Curtis in the yacht and Curtis showed falsely no feeling for kisses of Marilyn, but again the best came at the end when Lemmon told Brown that he was a man and Brown told him that it does not matter because nobody is perfect.",

The sight of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon dressed up as a couple of female is unforgettable! Wilder and long-time collaborator I.A.L. Diamond based their screenplay on ""Fanfaren der Liebe"" (1951), an original German musical. This lively farce about men masquerading as women juggles broard slapstick with sly sexual innuendo. The premise that two hopelessly red-blooded American guys could conceal themselves in a woman's only band is outrageous. Indeed, despite the amendments made to the Production Code in the wake of the Frank Sinatra classic ""The Man with the Golden Arm,"" ""Some Like It Hot"" managed to raise a lot of eyebrows. United Artists released the film without the MPAA logo in the credits or title sequence because the Production Code refused to give it their approval. Similarly, the Roman Catholic Legion of Decency gave ""Some Like It Hot"" their ""C"" rating which stands for 'condemned.' Believe it or not, Bob Hope starred in another movie called ""Some Like It Hot"" in 1939, but it shared on similarities with the 1959 movie aside from having the same title.",

Basically two musicians, Joe (Tony Curtis, Jamie Lee Curtis's Dad) and Jerry (BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Jack Lemmon) who need a job playing their instruments, one day witness a murder, and the gang are now on their trail. To hide themselves, and get a job at the same time, they disguise themselves as two women (probably one of the first cross-dressing films) to join a women's live concert band. They call themselves Josephine (obviously) and Daphne (Jerry didn't like the name Geraldine). During their time in the band, they meet the solo singer of the band, Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (gorgeous Golden Globe winning Marilyn Monroe). To make sure he can get her, Joe disguises himself as a captain of a boat who calls himself Junior, with a very convincing Cary Grant impression/accent, another reason for this disguise is that Joe (as a woman) has an admirer, while disguised Jerry is pestered by Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown). Also starring George Raft as Spats Colombo and Pat O'Brien as Det. Mulligan. The romance, the dressing as women, the accents, comedy faults and great ending with the great line, number 48 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes ""Well, nobody's perfect"" (after Jerry says he's a man) make this an excellent classic comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy. Jack Lemmon was number 43, and Marilyn Monroe number 39 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, she was number 6 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, Tony Curtis was number 86, and Monroe number 3 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols (she could have been number 1), and she was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 16 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, it was number 14 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Films.

Then there is the chance to see Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in drag for much of the movie - Lemmon, as daft Daphne, looks a fright but puts in a great, bubbly, comic performance as the girl who really does snare her own millionaire; while Curtis, as the overly made-up Josephine, sashays about with some style, while also appearing as a mock playboy who talks like Cary Grant (allegedly).",

The movie provides you with a bit of everything from madcap action, screwball comedy, mob drama, and campy romance, along with a little sugar on top in sweet sensation, Marilyn Monroe. Despite the apparent weight-gain she looks visually stunning, and her close-to-home performance is worth noting as well. There are many subtexts that lie in Billy Wilder's masterpiece, including one that could very well do with Marilyn's character Sugar Kane Kowalczyk. Much like Marilyn, the lounge singing Sugar is searching for love with a decent somebody other than the player-type she often frequents (in the film's case, saxophonists). Perhaps men found this sultry misses too intimidating, making Marilyn's love-life in the real world just the same.",
107,11 October 2020,sudhirkumarpal8,9, A treat to the eyes. Unforgettable,"Do colours matter? I doubt so.
When there is Marilyn Monroe in front of you. Hell no ! I don't care about the colours. That white brown shade of her body eclipses the icy white and sun-tanned shades of modern beauties.
The movies was some 2 hrs long and I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen even for a moment, and when Monroe arrived in any scene, hell not.
Her voice as sweet as a child's and the beauty shamming one of the most beautiful women I have seen ever, she is the perfect epitome of fantasy and desire, making even the strongest go weak in their knees.
Though beneath her ever-smiling face and eternal beauty lied some very troublesome facets of her life, atleast wikipedia says that, though it's hard to believe. This takes me to one realisation as well that ""Life is not always what meets the eye"".How can someone so tense, anxious and dissatisfied inside play such a happy calm composure on screen, and that too to such a perfection, fooling even the wisest men, atleast I think so, like me. If that is not the acting then what is. Tabloids and magazines may generalize her as a sex symbol and a dumb blonde but how fluently and easily she acted the real life opposite roles, makes me admire her, both her acting and her beauty.
Now back to movie; I think there is no going back to coz it was alll about Monroe and nothing else. Tony and Jack did one of the best comedies but that too fades in front of her.

Some Like It Hot is real classic in its own genre. Regardless of age it's still funny comedy. Especially some characters are very humoristic. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are amusing when they pretend to be a woman in order to escape from Chicago because of the gangsters who are after them. They are musicians in a speakeasy during the Prohibition Act and witness events involving gangsters and machine guns. This is why they escape. Marilyn Monroe acts a singer who get to know to the characters of Curtis and Lemmon. The boys go to the band as woman and Monroe with other women of the band doesn't know the truth. This causes funny situations. Maybe the best quote is saved for the last scene. Humor of Some Like It Hot is a mix of situation comedy and cross-dressing which isn't too exaggerated and is better than most of comedies.

116,20 January 2022,cmantafounis,9, Some Like It Hot,"Sometimes, universally-beloved and celebrated classics live up to their acclaim; unattainable expectations can be met. Such is the case with Some Like It Hot, which I became hopelessly enamoured by. Despite mixed experiences with screwballs in the past, this is working on so many levels that it was impossible not to appreciate all of it: a slapstick within a gangster flick, a rom-com without sentimentality, a sex-comedy without any sex. With this, Notorious, and countless other Old Hollywood staples, I have realised that romance is better portrayed on-screen with subtlety - Wilder pushes censors to their limits, utilising innuendo, phallic imagery, and a half-dressed Marilyn Monroe to create a film where every character is thinking about sex constantly, yet it is never crude or explicit, only cheeky and winking. ""Cross-dressing"" comedies always run the risk of lingering on one joke, and a dated one at that, as inevitable scenarios occur where characters have to hurriedly change outfits, or resist advances by someone of the same gender (can't have that!). The film features these tropes, to be sure, and I began worried that the humour would wear thin, but the rapid delivery and natural progression made it all feel fresh. There are visual gags aplenty around the lead males wearing drag, yes, however for the most part, the comedy is drawn from the broader absurdity of the whole scenario; it never looks down upon the idea, only the characters themselves for somehow reaching the point where this seemed the best course of action. (Or, at least, *I* think so. The concept of two men getting married is treated as obviously ridiculous, but in 1929/'59, it was. Also, Jerry's genuine excitement at the prospect of being engaged was a subversion I was not expecting for a studio movie from the '50s. I'm not nearly qualified enough to take this analysis any further, though, and I'm sure those who are have made far better, in-depth reappraisals of this aspect. Go read those. I know nothing.)",

She was good in the Seven Year Itch and the Misfits, so critics can't say she only had one great movie. But this is my favorite because she is cute, funny and somehow sexy and innocent at the same time. I have a feeling that's the way she really was in life. She couldn't help that she had that great skin and sex appeal. Would this movie be on nearly everyone's favorite 100 movies without her?

Some Like it Hot was Wilder's first collaboration IAL Diamond, after years without a consistent partner-in-crime. Neither man is entirely responsible for the fresh brilliance of this picture, but it seems in bouncing ideas they were able to feed off each others' abilities. The general style of comedy is very much Wilder's – the mix of plausible situation and outright farce, the elaborate visual gags derived from Ernst Lubitsch – but it seems likely that Diamond brought in a tighter and more disciplined angle, no doubt adding a joke or two of his own along the way. But what's great about this screenplay (and what makes the picture so continually engaging) is the way it progresses through different types of humour.",

We've all heard that saying, but when it comes to this movie, it's very true. This is a 'classic' in every sense of the word. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon star as Joe and Jerry, jazz musicians who inadvertently witness the St. Valentine Day's massacre. Knowing they were spotted and the mobsters are on the lookout for them, they disguise themselves as women and escape to Miami with an all-girl jazz band. Lead singer of the band is Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) and Joe, now in drag and calling himself Josephine, falls in love with her. Using some male clothing he managed to commandeer, Joe sets out to impress Sugar by pretending to be millionaire heir to Shell Oil. At first, things seem to be going well for him as he changes from 'Josephine' to 'Shell Oil Junior', maintaining both disguises successfully, however for his friend Jerry (using the name Daphne), things aren't as easy as one of Miami's genuine resident senior millionaires, 'Osgood Fielding III', has become smitten with 'her' and does everything to woo Daphne with roses, dinner and dances, and even a proposal of marriage. However, their seemingly complex, but carefree life in Miami is suddenly turned upside down as the hotel they are staying in, is hosting a conference for ""Italian Opera Lovers"", which is actually a cover name for a meeting of mobsters. The gang from Chicago are there along with their leader 'Spats', Joe and Jerry are spotted and realise they must quit the band and leave as soon as they can. Joe in his 'Shell Oil Junior' disguise, breaks Sugar's heart by convincing her that he can't carry on seeing her and has to leave to go and marry a woman his family has 'chosen' for him. After several chases, the guys, still in their drag, hide out in a conference room and again witness a mob killing, this time of 'Spats' and his gang. Now on the run from the other gang, Joe reveals his love and true identity to Sugar and along with Jerry (still dressed as Daphne) and with Osgood's help, the four escape in Osgood's boat heading out to his yacht. In the back of the boat Sugar and Joe confirm their love and kiss, but Jerry tries to dissuade Osgood with a list of reasons why they can't be together, finally pulling off his wig and revealing he is a man, this leads to one of the most famous lines in movie history as Osgood simply replies..'Nobody's perfect'. Directed by the great Billy Wilder, this film is frequently found at the top of lists of the greatest comedies ever made.

The humor is top notch and very smart. The funniest parts are when Curtis and Lemmon are bickering with each other. Apparently the black and white look was done because both of their makeup made them look so ugly that Wilder thought black and white cinematography would conceal their ugly makeup.

The desperate musicians have no choice, but to disguise themselves as women and join a all-girl band to escape the gang life, and hide out from pursing gangsters. Now in Miami, Joe falls for the lead singer of the band, the troubled Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe). He pursued her, by disguising himself as a millionaire to win her over, while Jerry is being courted by a real millionaire, Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown), mid while the gangsters out there still looking for them. The cast was great in their roles. Tony Curtis is brilliant, and his Cary Grant voice was amazing. Jack Lemmon is demoniacally funny and more likely to taken for a woman than Tony Curtis. Marilyn Monroe is just Marilyn Monroe. I really doubt it's acting,e ven the opening scene with the boys has her drinking whiskey no less and her playing a dull blonde trying to get marry a millionaire. Not really role model material. Marilyn was hostile, and was marked by refusals to participate in filming and occasional outbursts of profanity. Visibly Monroe was obviously trashed out during the film. It really does show if you look closer and think about it. It's a surprise to find out that Marilyn Monroe was pregnant when filming this movie. You can tell in some scenes, it was a body double. Still, she's as beautiful as any film she does, but that's doesn't make it a great actress. Not many actors enjoyed filming with her, it was too high maintenance with very little acting to make up for it. Tony Curtis wasn't really into kissing her saying it was like 'Kissing Hitler'. Her singing was mediocre as well. Brown was great, and funny and his final line in the film is a master stroke. Wilder wrote many of the most wittiest one-liners on film in one line. That final line sum up the film so well. It's not the best movie, but nobody's perfect, so it's works for what it is. A fun, good, movie.",

Lemmon and Curtis are a great team, bouncing those zingers off each other like there's no tomorrow. But it's Marilyn Monroe who's luminous here. This movie, more than any other, proves why she was the object of so many people's fantasies. From the ""I Wanna Be Loved By You"" song to the scene where she bravely tries to kiss Tony Curtis into feeling something (still one of the most erotic scenes on film), she is a goddess.

The 2 musicians that are dressed up as women are played by Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in their best performances since I don't know when. Writers Billy Wilder and I.A.L.

To be good, a drama film should be interesting, a mystery film should be mysterious and surprising, a musical should have good songs, a horror film should be frightening, and more to the point here, a comedy should be funny. There. I said it. A comedy should at some point have some joke that is in some way amusing. This seems to me to be a pretty solid and logical test of quality. And going by it, Some Like it Hot is not a good movie. In fact, it's an utterly terrible movie. Don't accuse me of being unable to deal with subtle humor; I can. P.G. Wodehouse and Henry Fielding are subtle, and I really like them. This isn't subtle. This is really in your face and painfully, dreadfully unfunny. There seriously isn't one joke in this that isn't massively predictable and totally unamusing. And as for the acting? They're not brilliant performances. They're really, really annoying, and it made me happy when all three of the main characters just stopped talking. This is a comedy, and a comedy is supposed to be funny.

One could expect the mob will show up in Florida to take revenge on escapees of the Valentine's day massacre and then continues to pursue Tony and Jack once they discover how they escaped dressed as women. Brilliant and enticing for its day Tony, Marily and Joe shine as they always do. Jack, who does more of the high jinx physical comedy than the other players in most of his comic films will please those who like his style but not those who think his mugging is too grand in focus for the screen.

It finds most of its comedy from its stars' bumbling attempts to balance their drag personas with their real ones. Curtis' character falls in love with Monroe's lead singer and decides to use inside knowledge gained as her female friend to woo her, while Lemmon's character - who often struggles to refrain from getting too 'excited', shall we say - has to contend with an old millionaire who has fallen in love with him. Contrary to what you may expect, the movie isn't all that problematic. It has aged rather well, with its humour almost constantly being good-natured and with its messages actually being somewhat progressive. For the most part, the piece plays out as a farce. It has moments of drama and moments of romance but comedy is its major focus. Occasionally, it's quite funny. It's also typically rather entertaining. It isn't massively compelling, though, and it starts to sag a bit in its mid-section. This overall lack of engagement brings the thing's highlights down somewhat. Still, it's a good effort. 6/10",

Tony Curtis is a millionaire, and Marilyn Monroe singing! What can be better?",
207,19 December 2012,oneislandphotography,10, Two musicians on the run from the mob don drag and meet sweet Sugar,"Some Like It Hot is a retelling of a West German tale titled Fanfaren der Liebe (1951) (Fanfares of Love) beautifully directed by Billy Wilder with an all-star cast including the eternal beauty of Marilyn Monroe, and comedy styling's of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. With a central prolific theme that has been told more than once and yet is just as prevalent today as it ever was or will be: What we want and what we need are often two separate things. However, under the expertise of Wilder, the pure star quality of cast and crew shine out all the more. The gags come thick and fast with almost every sequence either a set up for the next gag or a gag in the making. Some Like It Hot is a tale that begins with a bitterly cold February in Chicago 1929, which two musicians find themselves on the run from the mob, after witnessing the Saint Valentines Massacre. Our intrepid hero's Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) disguise themselves as female musicians Josephine (Curtis) and Daphne (Lemmon), and join an all-girl orchestra bound for Miami.",
208,10 March 2006,johno-21,9, A Billy Wilder classic,"Billy Wilder made some of my favorite films in Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend, Sunset Boulevard, Stalag 17, The Seven Year Itch and Some Like It Hot. A great presenter of romantic comedies and of drama as well. It was interesting reading how Frank Sinatra, Danny Kaye, Bob Hope, Jerry Lewis and Anthony Perkins and Mitzy Gaynor had been considered for this movie. Who knows what could have happened with Billy Wilder directing but what he got out of Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon was classic. I often wondered why this was filmed in black and white instead of color and the IMDb explained it as Wilder didn't like how Curtis' and Lemmon's makeup appeared on screen in color. I can't buy the explanation given that their makeup looked green on screen. That could have easily been corrected. I think color would have brought more attention to their overall appearance as men dressed as women and made them look less plausible and more like men in drag in the enhancement of color so for overall effect he shot it in black and white. It also fits the 1920's themed story. I've never seen this on the big screen but it was a staple on TV in the 60's and 70's and has been since. I've probably seen this at least a dozen times and have alway enjoyed it. It's been a few years since I've seen it last and I wouldn't mind seeing it again soon. A great cast in support with George Raft, Pat O'Brien, Joe E. Brown who is especially good and Nehemiah Persoff. Nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Actor for Jack Lemmon, it won it's only Oscar for Best Costume Design. It's a quick paced, fun film but for me falls a little short and I would give it a 9.0 on a scale of 10.",

It's a film that is ground-breaking, because of the underlying sexual identity tones found in the subplot. Those tones are struck by taking Tony Curtis (Josephine) and Jack Lemmon (Daphne), into a situation they can't avoid. In order for them to survive being killed by the mob, Joe (Curtis) and Jerry (Lemmon), have to dress as women musicians, in order to make their escape to Miami. Both actors' performances are dead-on perfect and both of them do extremally good jobs alternating between themselves and their female alter-egos.",
210,30 December 2014,arminhage,3, Don't watch this movie based on Billy Wilder's credentials,"I noticed that most people watch this movie solely because of 2 names. Billy Wilder and Marilyn Monroe although the real credit goes to Jack Lemmon who became a woman and played as a woman so good which I almost forgot he was Jack Lemmon! Jack Lemmon's performance was nothing short of a masterpiece dwarfing any subsequent similar attempts like Dustin Hoffman's in Tootsie so there is something very original and unique about this movie however even Jack Lemmon's mind blowing performance was not enough to cover the shitty screenplay, insane cheesiness and obvious deficiencies in production. Let's start from Miami. I have no problem that Wilder decided to film Miami in San Diego California. Palm trees are palm trees and the thing about the difference in direction of afternoon shadow on east coast and west coast in not something an ordinary audience would pick up immediately however filming the the movie in a famous landmark like ""Hotel Del Coronado"" was an unforgivable insult to the audience's intelligence. That's something I never expected from Billy Wilder, a shameful disappointment. The second problem was character development or the character ark. Sugar Cane (Monroe) was a woman attracted to millionaires, yachts, private train cars and money of course. She was the best imitation of a shallow character. Now to make her fall in love with a 2 bit musician like Joe (Tony Curtis) was required a great character ark. Sugar Cane remained the shallow character till the very end. She fell in love with a fake millionaire or his fake money to be more precise as there was nothing lovely about the fake millionaire that Joe invented but his money. When Joe called her o say goodbye, she became upset and sad because she lost the millionaire. She never fell in love with the quality of kiss or sex, bottom line is that she never fell in love with Joe as a human being. What one could reasonably expect was shocking and emotional encounter between Sugar Cane but what really happened was a flat hasty encounter as Joe exposed himself in front of everyone and gave her the hasty and flat kiss. Based on what was developed (or not developed) in the movie, the logical response was anger and despise not that hasty baseless character ark in final minutes of the movie. It was so bad and cheesy that it could win an award of cheesiness and awfulness! Also nothing was cute about the humor, the flat humor was as childish as a Pink Panther cartoon which made the movie almost boring. 2 hours was a long time for such movie, a better editing and possibly trim it to 90 minutes could mask most of the problems so I would say the editing was a masterpiece of awfulness by itself. I don't know where the 8+ rating came, I can't find a reasonable answer why a serious film critic would give this movie anything more than 4. 3/10",

212,18 November 2013,marceguila,8," Well, Nobody's Perfect","Some Like It Hot is an American comedy film, made during 1958 and released during 1959, which was directed by Billy Wilder. This comedy made controversy out of its use of not very common themes in the cinema theaters. The use of themes like homosexuality, mafia and gangster difficulties, and alcoholism were all themes that were not common at all during the ages of the 1950s. The use of stereotypes as blondes symbolized as dumb and unconsciously acting women, gangsters as selfish and crude men, and musicians as poor and needy people make the movies way of description easier since just by getting to know the characters you know what they are and what they want. It all starts at an old 1950s Chicago, when Jerry and Joe, two musicians escape from the closure of an illegal pub. They run away with no where to go and look for jobs since they are almost money- less. The most valuable things they have are their instruments. They find out about a band who is leaving in tour and needs two musicians, but the problem is that the band is composed by all female musicians, so they reject the job. After looking for other jobs Joe and Jerry happen to become witnesses of a mafia murder so they run away again but this time away from the mafia. For them to get away from the area they finally take the female band tour and leave with the other female musicians as if they were women. Everything happens to go well as they pretend to be female musicians but someone intervenes in their plans, and that someone is Sugar, interpreted by Marylyn Monroe. She happens to be a really beautiful but dumb girl who is part if the band. They both fall in love with her. They finally reach their destination, Miami, Florida. They get there and another character appears, he is Osgood. He falls in love of the female version of Jerry, Daphne. The story goes on and Joe tries to make Sugar fall in love with a fake millionaire version of him, and it sorts to work out. Joe got the idea that Jerry should take Osgood, the money-abundant old man, dressed as Daphne out for a dinner to a Latin bar at the coast, while Joe dressed as the fake millionaire version of him takes Sugar with him into Osgood's yacht at the beach. The morning after it happened that Daphne and Osgood got engaged, Osgood without knowing that Daphne is in reality Jerry. Sugar is sad because her ""new loved man"" has gone. Jerry and Joe find out that the Mafia convention is taken place in the same hotel they are in. The gangsters happen to recognize both Jerry and Joe as women and look for them. They hide and happen to witness another murder but his time the murder of the gangsters who were following them. Now the new gangster follow them and Joe has this idea in which he could reveal himself to Sugar and take her with him and Daphne to Osgood's yacht where they left together as two couples, Sugar and the real Joe, and Osgood and Daphne, who in reality is Jerry. Osgood doesn't care he is a man. All of these events go around the themes I mentioned. Homosexuality is highlighted when Osgood doesn't care about Daphne's sex and when Joe, as a woman loves Sugar. Gangster and Mafia problematics when they witness and are followed by the mafia in both cities, Chicago and Miami. The story made controversy when it was revealed to the audience since they weren't used to themes of that big impact in society. In my opinion the movie has to fix some details as the cast acting skills and the short and brief ending. Everything else in the movie is mostly good. The settings, the music, the filming techniques, and many other characteristic that build a great movie.",

So I went into this film with great expectations but I was very much disappointed. The plot sounds very exciting but something went wrong somewhere.

It was an extra credit film for my Film History class that I am taking currently. I have seen many black and white films before but nothing compared to this one. From the first scene to the end credits my mind was on a complete roller coaster ride. I was very impressed with the main characters and how the actor/actresses playing them held their own throughout the entire film.The way the two main actors portrayed the two women throughout the entire was really impressive. This is a film I would recommend because it combines humor,suspense, romance, and violence in a unique way that really captures the time period it was filmed in. I can clearly say that this film for me was really enjoyable and nothing like I expected it to be. I hope it is enjoyable for others as much as it was enjoyable for me!!!",

217,12 August 2013,Robert_duder,6, Average in almost every way...don't stone me!!,"While I am a student of Political history and could recite many a Marilyn Monroe fact or conspiracy theory to you, I had yet to see her in one of her iconic films. So finally I sat down to watch what is generally considered one of the greatest film comedies of all time. That is a lot to live up to and I didn't realize just how popular the film was until I logged on here to write this review. 8.4 on IMDb?! Now, please don't get me wrong...I enjoyed this movie. It was fun and wild and absolutely I can see how and why it pushed the limits back then. I'm not sure I have seen so many analogies and innuendos in one film. They were being shoved down your throat like a case of mistaken identity on Three's Company. The first analogy or clever innuendo is a chuckle and not much else but after the twentieth...it gets tired. The setting of 1929 makes some pretty intense action/gangster scenes even for the time. It was almost shocking to watch it now and that was kind of a neat mix to the comedy. Some of the comedic moments are almost dark in nature. I was surprised that I didn't really feel a lot of the humour had homophobic undertones which I thought would be a certainty. If anything, the very last gag in the film is almost pro-gay in some ways and it was definitely worth a laugh.",
218,21 June 2012,Cosmoeticadotcom,6, Good,"Some films are terrifically overrated, even if they are solid, enjoyable little films. Perhaps the most glaring example of this dictum is Billy Wilder's 1959 black and white comedy Some Like It Hot. It often appears on Best Of lists as the top comedy of all time, but, while a good, solid film, it is nowhere near a great film, in screen writing, technical measures, nor in, well, laughs per minute. Let's tackle those three things in reverse. Perhaps the funniest film ever made, in terms of laughs per minute is Stanley Kramer's 1963 all star comedy, It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. It's a pants-pisser that unleashes 2-3 guffaws per minute. The scene where Jonathan Winters destroys the gas station is priceless. By contrast, Some Like It Hot hasn't a single guffaw in the whole film- a number of moments that make you smile and tee-hee, but guffaw? No. Part of this is because the film has not aged well- it's hard to still laugh at drag jokes nowadays. Also, the film is not even a parody nor satire, like Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb. Then there's Wilder's own significant cache of comedies, the best of which I'd argue is his VASTLY underrated 1966 black and white comedy, The Fortune Cookie, which is far superior to Some Like It Hot, for many reasons, but primarily because, while the films shared Jack Lemmon, The Fortune Cookie had Walter Matthau and no Marilyn Monroe, while Some Like It Hot was burdened with Monroe, and lacked the comically impeccable Matthau. More on the Monroe debacle in a bit.",
219,10 May 2023,Horst_In_Translation,6, Dragged a bit,"""Some Like It Hot"" is an American (mostly) comedy live action film from 1959, so this one will have its 65th anniversary next year or maybe it happened already depending on when you read this review of mine. I can imagine that for this anniversary the film will be shown again on the big screen at many movie theaters, but I myself had the chance to see it on the occasion of a currently-running Marilyn Monroe retrospective and I went for it and do not really regret going, even if I cannot share the gigantic praise this film has received in the decades since its production. I think some call it the best comedy ever made, but there is no way I would agree there and the inclusion of the film in the top-250 highest-rated-movies list on the renowned imdb website I cannot support either, especially as it is not only barely hanging in there, but still almost in the first halt at this point. This is a black-and-white movie which surprises me a bit because of the colorful film poster that features all three protagonists, but we will get to those a little later. And also a bit unusual because (Monroe) comedies from those days were usually in color. The film is not only adored by many still today, but was already one of the big awards players back then. It won the Oscar for costume design, one of three Oscars Orry-Kelly won out of only four nominations, impressive even more so because he stood at 3/3 for quite some time. He was already over the age of 60 when he worked on this one and death was sadly just five years away. Very interesting biography too. There is as much behind this unusual name as you could think. But let's not make this about him only. Cinematographer Charles Lang also scored one of his double-digit Oscar nominations that happened in five different decades, but won only once. Art directors Haworth and Boyle had just won their (only) Oscars in the years before this film and managed to sneak in again too. And Billy Wilder of course, well his history with the Academy was one of a kind and here he managed two nominations too for this film, even if he could not win any.",

Tony Curtis as Joe/Josephine/ Jr. As Jr. he sounds somewhat like Cary Grant. His classic good looks don't come across well as a woman nor does Jack Lemmon. Are they ever homely! Marilyn Monroe as Sugar Kane made me know why she's such a legend. She has the sweetest voice and the most titilating sexuality of any of screen sirens of today even. She is an amazing mix of femme fatale and little girl innocence. Joe E Brown as Osgood Fielding the 3rd was great! He is a comic geninus. The bell hops crush on Josephine is a riot. The dialouge is wonderful. The line ""nobody's perfect"" is all so true and this film gives it new meaning even though this film is the exception to the rule!

To get away from the Mob they joined an all women's band going to Miami but the only problem is they're both men. Joe and Jerry both pull off the role of women perfectly because they acted like women good enough that it fooled other people to think that they were women. I would say that the element of disguise is a good way to describe both of them. Both of their instruments played a pivotal role in why they got to Miami, Joe and Jerry play two instruments that the women's band needed.

I know it has been highly rated as an all time classic comedy and I can see why. I love Tony CUrtis and Jack Lemmon as two male band players forced to dress up as women in order to get out of CHicago after the Valentine's Day massacre in 1929. Tony Curtis deserves a lot of credit for playing the male suitor to Marilyn Monroe's Sugar. Even though Jack Lemmon is hysterical as Daphne, you can't forget how giddy and happy he is when he finds love with a male suitor played wonderfully by Joe E. Brown. I forget who plays the female conductor but she's also wonderful in the film. It's sad that Marilyn Monroe died so young only three years after making this wonderful classic film. She and Tony Curtis appear made for each other in this film. Jack Lemmon was well deserved of his Oscar nomination but I can't imagine why they left out Tony Curtis. Billy Wilder chose wisely to film it in black and white. I love the train ride scenes and once they are down in Florida. I love and miss both Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe. I wish Tony Curtis would talk about it on the Actors Studio since he is still very much alive and well.",

Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are great too, alternating between annoyance at finding themselves harassed by pathetic men (where it's nice to see the shoe on the other foot) and trying to control their libidos around the all-female band they've joined to escape some gangsters. Lemmon gets off all sorts of barbed comments, either catty or lusty, which he delivers perfectly, and he has a hilarious tango scene with his 70-year-old suitor (Joe E. Brown). Meanwhile Curtis is funny too, playing the voice of reason until he goes after Monroe's character with a Cary Grant impression, and convinces her to keep kissing him so that he'll ""feel something."" (hello) Wilder's pace is fantastic, and the laughs and titillation seem non-stop. I loved the little in-joke George Raft got in as well; he's a gangster who notices a young tough repeatedly flipping a coin up in the air, and asks him derisively where he learned such a cheap trick. It was Raft, of course, in Scarface (1932) who was so iconic doing that. Just a witty, fun film - and a brilliant ending too.",

There were two (and only two!) moments wherein I didn't actually laugh, but merely stated: ""that was kind of funny..."" that's it, I spoke the words, didn't actually laugh! The only thing that stands out about this ""greatest comedy of all time"" is the fact that Marilyn Monroe is so chunky! Not to condone our societies current body image ideals, but if Marilyn Monroe was even attempting to make it into movies these days, I doubt she would get her foot in the door... yet another counter to the ""stands the test of time"" statements. Additionally, neither of the two lead actors' performances even hold up to much of their other work... come on, tony Curtis was funnier in Spartacus! And Lemmon, as we know, just aged like a fine wine.

However I feel despite being a huge Jack Lemmon Fan that it has not faired well from the passage of time. With a lot of films of 40 to 50 years ago there is a tendency to view with rosy coloured glasses and not from having sat through it again and critically evaluated it. The humour is particularly dated and the plot with honesty thin. Okay it was a great film for its time, but films have improved in the 48 years since this was made.",
265,6 December 2009,emhughley,10, Absolutely hilarious...,"Marilyn back on top after a 2 year vacation from the screen, and boy was she worth the wait! Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis bosom buddies indeed. A huge success all the way around. The script, direction, co-stars and sets are all superb. Jack Lemmon as Daphne is the other reason to watch it. I feel his role excelled past Tony Curtis because Daphne was written with better comedic situations in mind. Apparently Lemmon got along better with Monroe because in his own words, he completely understood the painstaking artistry of what it took to do that thing she did. Jack Lemmons comedic delivery is first rate here. Tony Curtis is completely believable and does a great job as Monroes love interest. Marilyn delivers a spectacular performance as Sugar Kane, the dizzy blonde routine so beloved by her fans. As Sugar, Monroe is equal parts vulnerable and confident. I am very surprised Monroe wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this role. In her personal life she had so many unresolved issues with rejection, and what a pity Hollywood never really respected her in that form. She sure as hell made a lot of money for the studios and the suites that ran that town back in the day. My favorite sequence (among many) in this film, is the train sequence and Marilyn uttering the line ""Goodnight Honey"" to Jack Lemmon. The eventual party that ensues in Jack Lemmons berth makes my side split every time I see it. Im glad the film was shot in black and white. The film holds up very well even with todays standards. I hope it is never ""colorized"" for the next generation. If you are ever in San Diedo CA. go to the Coronodo Hotel where this was filmed. It looks exactly like it did back in 1959 and there are a lot of photos on display about the making of the film. Most of us know the rest of the plot by heart so I wont get into that.

He was also something of a hoofer as well. (Thanks to YouTube, his performances can now be seen and reviewed.) Somebody must have neglected to tell George Raft that he was making a comedy; he plays the role of mobster hit-man (Spats Colombo) straight. Comedy means taking a point of absurdity and drawing it to its logical conclusion; and not recognizing an absurdist moment, playing that straight makes for a very droll form of comedy.",

270,11 October 2007,jonathan-577,9, brilliantly orchestrated chaos,"The most astonishing thing about this movie is that it works at all. I love Billy Wilder but The Seven Year Itch drove me right up the fricking wall with its testocentric mugging, and why should this movie have been any different when it pulls the same trick? Well first off, the context has opened waaay up: it appropriates the St. Valentine's Day Massacre as its inciting incident, it sweeps from Chicago winter to Florida sunshine. And this time, the filmmakers figure out how to construct an interesting critique of masculinity through the medium of Marilyn. Give us TWO male protagonists, joined at the hip; give us some gangsters to put their hormonal aspirations into some critical context; and by the time you've thrown in Joe E. Brown's lovable goofball playboy, the layering is so intense that it almost begins to resemble depth, and the construction so disorienting that it constantly feeds the comic requirement of surprise. That Tony Curtis's impersonation of a British millionaire sounds more like John Clarke only adds to the fun. And while Marilyn is still Marilyn, she's also looking a little rough around the edges here and there - her on-set nervous breakdown seems to have been incorporated rather than papered over. Brilliantly orchestrated chaos, suggesting that Wilder is only really Wilder when he's also A. I. L. Diamond.",

Jack Lemmon is perfectly cast as usual, and delivers one great line after another as in just about every film he's in. Marilyn Monroe is brilliant here and proves to be a much greater actress than I would have thought. Tony Curtis also does very well in his role, and is very funny in claiming to be the owner of the Shell gas stations. My only problem with this film is the general job of acting done in this film. Somehow a lot of the movie just didn't come off as very realistic to me. In another film involving men disguising themselves as women (""Tootsie""), everything that happens seems believable and real. Here the acting by most of the supporting cast does not seem real to me. I personally find a film funnier if I can imagine all of the events really happening.

While not my favorite movie in the long career spanning decades for Wilder, this is still an outrageous comedy featuring three very fine performances and a subject that went against social taboos at the time. This is a screwball comedy that is often compared to films created by the Marx Brothers. While I see the comparisons as easy as the light of day, Wilder's film resonates more thematically. As for the three leads, Marilyn Monroe has never been sexier, Tony Curtis has never been cooler, and this is Jack Lemmon at the height of his career. The film did not speak to me like other Wilder's films (The Apartment is a great one) because not all the jokes work, and the pacing can be slow at times. Still, there is no denying the presence it has in the canon of the best, influential movies. And the ending? Loved it! When Osgood quotes, ""Well, nobody's perfect"" to Lemmon's bewildered face to end the movie, I nearly choked on my own laughter. More than sixty years later, that ending remains perfect.

However soon they will find out that the job is for women musician only. Here we have Joe looking frustrated and trying to come up with some other ideas while Jerry tells Joe what if they did it. What if they took the gig and pose as women. Now Originally Joe is against this idea and asks Jerry if he is out of his mind. But soon after, they find out that the gangsters are looking for them.

At the same time we have Jerry surprised and trying to copy and imitate Joe's voice and behavior. Next we get a cut to the next scene, were Joe and Jerry are dressed up as drag. In this scene they use (low angle tracking shot with top lighting) as they are walking side by side. Jerry is having a hard time walking in his outfit and his legs look more spread apart then Joe as they walk down the train station. Then we get another (tracking shot) and we see Jerry now known as Daphne, looking at Joe, now known as Josephine. Jerry takes one look at Joe as they are walking and he quickly turns around again to get a second look (POV shot). He seems confused as how easy it is for Joe to walk in that outfit so comfortably. He regains his composure and tries to imitate Joe. Once they see the girls boarding the train Jerry starts having doubts and tells Joe that it is no use and that ""we cannot get away with this Joe."" Joe reminds him that the name is Josephine now and tells him that, ""wasn't this your idea?"" Again, here we have the more masculine guy accepting his feminine persona more easily as the less masculine guy is confused and doubtful about his. For its time, this movie was revolutionary in my opinion. In challenging the hegemonic discourse of the time, or perhaps even now. Not only it challenged the idea of male masculinity but it also challenged heterosexuality and homosexuality such as (LGBT) politics. It renders the idea of biology mute and it instead creates a gray area of preference for sex. This is where we can apply the notion of queer theory. ""queer theory challenges notions of homosexuality and heterosexuality within the mainstream discourse, and instead posits an understanding of sexuality that emphasizes shifting boundaries, ambivalence's, and cultural constructions that change depending on historical and cultural context.""

I hadn't seen this in quite some time, but Lord knows how many times I have in my lifetime and some of it can still make me laugh out loud. This tale of two musicians dressed as women in an all girl band due to running from jazz age gangsters has many times been called the greatest comedy ever made. It may not get the laughs it once did, but it probably deserves that title. Despite the endless tales of the difficulties in filming it, there is just nothing wrong with it. It is smart, funny, well acted, superbly written and it just gets better as it rolls along. This is not Marilyn Monroe's best performance, but she is perfect for the role and this is definitely the best film she was ever in. She truly dazzles. Tony Curtis does well as one half of this drag duo, but he is no match for the comedic talents of his co-star, Jack Lemmon, who is sensational. Lemmon had one of the greatest careers in Hollywood, won two Oscars, but for my money, this may be his finest hour in a career full of them. Thanks to him, the writing and directing, the upper berth and engagement scenes are among the gems in the history of Hollywood film comedies. This film just never gets old. It is simply a comic masterpiece from the great Billy Wilder whose direction was nominated for an Oscar, but not the film itself, one of the most glaring omissions in the Academy's history, though they have quite a few of them and this one is near the very top. It's wonderful.",

My dad told me a long time ago that Marilyn was a beautiful woman. I stared at the voluptuous woman moving across the screen and her slightly bloated figure, wondering where her beauty lay, and now her face burned me.
In the movie, she describes her ideal man in a tone of infinite fascination, saying that he should wear his eyes, because it would make him look naive and helpless, just like herself. To the heartbreaking face of innocence. But Billy Wilder saw right through her, put her on the moonlit yacht, and told her in a blissful voice, ""I wish my mother was here, and she saw me with a girl from Nevada and shell ii."" It's eerily true. At the end of the movie, she hops on a yacht with a poor guy.
The essence of comedy is coincidence. There must be a ""wish mama was here"" moment in life, but there was no yacht that happened to be there at the end of the day, and even if there were, she would not have followed the pauper. That dreamy expression made her face seem to have been enveloped in a light mist, filled with longing for the world of flowers. The desire of a moth for a lamp is no better than the desire of a butterfly for spring. The moving dream is that the candle fire like spring fog dense unknown place. The century she was in had not yet begun like a flower in a fog, and Titanic was not yet happy that her head had fallen into the water. Who would have thought of the thousand doom that lay ahead? Who can blame a woman for a lack of resourcefulness for a desire that is not even ambitious? She lost to grace kelly, she lost to Jacqueline Kennedy, nezha was just a kid even though he had three heads and six arms, and sun wukong was just a monkey even though he had one head and six arms. This world belongs to the tang priest who looks the most like the tathagata. The western sky is also only one, even if the mouth is hard, also have to admit that the western world today looks like the United States. Women are like grace and Jacqueline. Monroe, the woman like Monroe, like wrong love on the queen of tang's monk, in addition to the United States, in addition to sad, what still have? Had to desolate send jade emperor brother to travel, but this is not her fault, pig eight quit, sand monk, sun monkey did not mention, she never saw a better man.

Some Like It Hot was arguably MM's best role & she was almost up staged by her two drag partners in crime, Jack Lemmon & Tony Curtis, for whom this was arguably their best role as well. Billy Wilder was at the height of his powers & despite his famous difficulties with MM, he managed to squeeze her most endearing performance & provided flattering cinematography. I believe this was Wilder's finest comedy, which is saying something. Keep in mind this was 1959 & was conceived under a long Eisenhower administration.

These days I usually skip the first 30 minutes (i.e. the worst part of the film): The antics of Spats Colombo and the other cretinous lowlife gangs leave me cold. Also the film would have had a much better ending if ALL the mafia gangsters came to a grisly end.,

by Billy Wilder (USA, 1959, 121', B/W)
Set a bench standard for ensemble comedy acting that has never been equaled. Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, and Marilyn Monroe all at the top of their game against prohibition era gangster setting. Curtis and Lemmon on the run after accidentally witnessing a gangland massacre have to dress up as females to hide from the mob and Monroe joins them. Ends with famous Joe E. Brown line, ""well, nobody's perfect"" but this movie is just about the perfect comedy from stem to stern.
Curtis once quipped that kissing Monroe in this picture was like kissing Hitler, but if so -- well, make mine Hitler.

I mean, as I'm sure you've heard if you've watched Thirteen at all this week, AFI recently named SOME LIKE IT HOT as the greatest American comedy of all-time. If the same movie were made today, I'm not sure it would fly. In today's more liberated society, men dressing up as women isn't that much of a novelty and it is my opinion that modern audiences would reject the coincidences that the plot hinges on (Lemmon and Curtis actually witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre AND the mob chasing them just happens to show up at the same hotel in Florida!). However, because it is from the fifties and in black and white, today's audiences tend to be a little more accepting, as if to assume that's they way things were done back then.",
366,17 April 2004,Blondi85,7, average movie,"Some Like It Hot? How about some like it perverted! This is surprisingly a very sexual driven movie, especially for the era. The movie is very sneaky with the dirty jokes. Some Like It Hot is about two men ( Joe and Jerry) on the run from the mob. They end up in disguise in none other than women's clothes to escape from the mob. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon did great playing females! A little too well. They were a great comedic duo and made the film funny. Who didn't need to be in the film is Marilyn Monroe who played Sugar the girl that Joe and Jerry of course fall for. The Sugar character is funny, but the casting director could have most likely found someone better than Marilyn Monroe. The only reason they should have Marilyn in the film is because of the music. She did do well singing the cute yet sultry songs that were in the movie.  It's hard to believe Marilyn Monroe was such an icon in that decade and still is today. Yes, she is pretty, but her acting skills were not great in this movie. It seemed like she was forcing the lines and facial expressions out. The plot is predictable now, but most likely in the 50's it wasn't predictable since it was very risky. It is not the funniest film ever but funny enough to at least see once. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon's comedic talents were the highlight of the movie, but unfortunately Marilyn's bad acting skills somewhat ruined the film. This movie is a 7/10.",

Mostly for being Marilyn Monroe's greatest movie. The woman had a presence that was larger than life, but was in a lot of clunkers, as the studio system didn't really now what to do with her except use her as eye candy. Her character in Seven Year Inch doesn't even have a name! Her Sugar Kane (aka Sugar Kowalczyk), while ""not very bright"" by her own admission, has an optimism and a sadness that was what made Monroe the icon she is today. Jack Lemon also shines as Jerry/Sugar. Once Jerry becomes Daphne (he was going to be Geraldine, but never liked that name), it's like he truly comes alive. Jerry is a worrier, but Daphne is always cracking jokes, ending almost every line of dialogue with a giggle. http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/02/19/some-like-it-hot/",

Marlyn Monroe does an excellent job at being a stero-typical blonde. She cannot resist tenor sax players and never stops and always gets hurt.Her character is not one of the best,her weakness' are men, and alcohol. She is very naive, but plays the part well of a sexy jazz singer of the times. Her voice and good looks are a natural attraction to Joe. (Who happens to befriend her while being dressed like a girl)He learns of the heartbrakes that she has had during her life and vows not to hurt her. But when he can no longer resist her he devises a plan to win her heart and not hurt her at the same time. But when he has to leave suddenly,he blows his cover and she cannot resist him and his tenor sax.This movie however, is very funny. The fact that they must dress up as women, and the billionaire who does not care that Daphne is really Jerry is hillarious. The extreme to which Joe tries to win Sugar over is amazing, to plunging in a bath tub with all their clothes on, and dressing up as a yacht owner to a yacht he doesn't even own. This is then topped by Jerry and Joe running from the mob dressed in girls clothing and heels. A funny movie for all to watch. Overall I would give this movie a 7 out of 10 for humour.",

386,13 February 2021,foltzjamie,10, Nobody's Perfect,"The 1959, Romantic Comedy Classic, Some Like It Hot, starring Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis, and Jack Lemmon, tells a story in times of sociological pressures of perfection and conceptualism of the structure of society. 1959 marked the beginning of, what we would later call, LGBT communities. The approach to submitting a movie that promotes tolerance towards cross dressing and ultimately the idea of homosexuality, is done with impeccable timing. To set the movie in earlier era allows for the viewer to think that such a tolerance was being upheld in that specific time era. Perpetuating for the allowance in the era to date. Film stood to put the war behind. This film did so, with a concentrated focus of enlightenment derived and depicted through the life of struggling musicians. The movie depicted an era where individuals could be anything/anyone. They were able to swap their former lives for the life of luxury. Music was becoming even more popular across the country. The all women's band represented female independence as well as equality. This was an era of times for embarking on a journey of self-discovery and rebellion, which was depicted by the character Sugar. Sugar was a runaway with the hopes of a life change through marriage. Flirtatiousness and drinking were deviant in the eyes of society. However, depicted with finesse and naturality in this romantic comedy. My favorite line of the movie was in the last scene. Two words precedent to the entire film, ""...nobody's perfect.""",

A film that made a choice that many would have considered a bit ""too ambitious"" or "" too outrageous"" for when it was made that choice being having two men dress and act like women. I definitely feel the idea of cross-dressing would be more acceptable in today's world despite some of society's/culture's differences on the matter, but making a choice such as cross-dressing back in 1959 was a very bold move. The story of the film is a cleverly written piece a comedy gold which combines not only humor but wit, amusement, and great direction. The comedy genre is probably one of the hardest genres to become acclaimed by both critics and audiences, whereas, other genres like dramas some times have easier when it comes being considered an acclaiming film. A well written script and dialogue exchanges all culminate into enjoyable performances from Monroe, Lemmon, Curtis and the rest the secondary cast members.",

I recall watching another film made in the same era, where Tony Curtis played a slave to the Laurence Olivier Roman nobleman, in which the latter was explaining that some people like oysters and some like snails, but it was possible to like both! Was this just a subtle attempt to tell the public, it's OK to live in both worlds?

410,23 July 2008,spasticsnake,8," Some Like It ""What"" ?","Ever since I first viewed this film in 1983, I found this this film funny but not as riotous as others found it to be. Now, 25 years later, I still find this film overrated. For years, I've been trying to figure out why. Now I'm attempting to articulate my feelings for this comedy, for it's another ""classic"" film which needs its merits re-examined. This film has a terrific comic premise, but it didn't need to be dragged out for two hours. Any film with a farcical tone risks losing sustaining power with a long running time. One other film which died under its own weight was the three-hour-plus ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"", whose success ultimately rested on its cast, a mixture of serious actors(Spencer Tracy, for one), good(Sid Caesar, Jonathan Winters, etc.)and mediocre comic actors(Ethel Merman anybody?). Then again, director Stanley Kramer isn't famous for his comic gifts. Now for the cast of ""Some Like It Hot"". No blame will be heaped upon Tony Curtis & Jack Lemmon, whose performances in & out of drag justifies the positive reputation of this film; in fact, this film screeches to halt whenever either of them is off-screen. As for Marilyn Monroe, I enjoyed her singing; otherwise, I found her miscast in this film. The role of Sugar Kane needed someone with an unquestionably stronger sense of self than Monroe was capable of projecting here. Her frequently reported unprofessional behavior off-screen is all too evident here within this film; sadly, it would be the beginning of the end for her career and her life. Nevertheless, her name meant big box office for the film, and it is forever preserved on this film; however, there is no accounting for taste in what the public finds sexy, then or now. As for the rest of the cast, the only other actors who showed comic timing were Joan Shawlee as Sweet Sue and Joe E. Brown as Lemmon's romantic partner Osgood Fielding. Too bad the same couldn't be said for either George Raft or Pat O'Brien. I'm sure neither of them were hired for being funny, yet it's too bad director Billy Wilder didn't allow either of them to deliver his dialog with a little tongue-in-cheek. But Raft & O'Brien stop the film in its tracks, and that is symptomatic of a film farce lacking in any sense of pacing. Any good film farce needs to move, but this one stagnates and lumbers about.",
411,10 August 2017,jolyonsykes,9, Still hot after all these years,"This movie has not aged; it's still wonderful, full of laughs and surprises. The violence is handled well, almost as slapstick, and Marilyn thoroughly deserved her Best Actor award. The friendship and tension between Curtis and Lemmon helps carry the story, as does Joe E Brown as the fourth corner in this love triangle, but the real star is writer Billy Wilder. The dialog is perfect, probably the result of endless rewrites. Osgood gets the final line, ""Well - nobody's perfect"" but the script continues, hinting at a sequel: ""But that's another story - and we're not quite sure the public is ready for it.""",
412,5 July 2019,MeDipti,8, Fun good pacing and Im sure having two guys dress in drag was pretty shocking back then.,This is my all-time favorite comedy. I think it is truly a timeless masterpiece. It is also my favorite Marilyn Monroe film - and Jack Lemmon is just hilarious.,
413,19 January 2022,nawixi,8, 8\10,"Some Like it Hot is a truly delightful and hilarious comedy with brilliant acting and a great script. It's the kind of comedy where the desire for sex is part of the story, and while there were movies that ignored it, this movie uses it to amazing effect. The plot is brilliantly constructed and almost thought out: two men escape after witnessing a mob fight and join a women's group disguised as women, and this is where the film gets tricky. Billy Wilder's direction is impeccable, the cinematography is beautiful, and the music is superb. The real treasure, apart from the performances, is the script, full of classically delightful lines that are not only funny but also smart. The performances are just perfect, while Tony Curtis and Jack Curtis gave really great roles, it was the beautiful Marilyn Monroe, in a delightfully seductive and sly performance, who stole the acting honors. Overall, this is a really great comedy that ranks alongside comedies like Duck Soup and Night at the Opera as one of the best comedies of all time.",
414,31 August 2022,pearlyguillotine,10, Gentle side,"Ok, I have watched ""Some Like It Hot"" (1959). The film has warmed my heart by: how gentle depiction of men in this old relic of a film from the time of stifling gender expectations, 24 hour dress code, and how dexterous were the screenwriters to sneak the themes banned by Hollywood censorship (Hays_Code), partly for quite absurd reasons .",
415,27 September 2017,rita-catita-85248,9, Brilliant,"I must say that this movie was a surprise, in the most wonderful way. Everything about it was just so smart and catchy: I couldn't stop laughing. Marilyn Monroe probably did here the part of her career (she was stunning with all those clothes; the wardrobe of the entire cast was spectacular). The story line was well accomplished, and so did the final scene. ",
416,23 March 2000,Terri-29,10, My favorite film,"What can I say about this splendid film that has not already been said over and over again.  I have watched this adorable movie many times, never tiring of it. The acting is superb, funny and touching.  The best thing has to be the delightful dialog so witty and original. Great, wonderful if only all films were like this.",
417,25 March 2000,StageDiva,10, Greatest movie of all time,"I've seen this movie at least 20 times, and it has been my favorite movie since the first time I saw it (which was almost 10 years ago). Jack Lemon, Tony Curtis and Monroe, need I say more? This movie has the greatest last line of any movie I have ever seen, and if you're a fan check out the musical ""Sugar"" which was made after Some like it Hot and is based on it, it's really cute. If you haven't seen this movie, RENT IT",
418,25 May 2019,mogugipi,8, Perfect Comedy & Comedians!!,"I have watched this movie for the first time online on youtube and I'm kicking myself for waiting so long!! It's the best comedy movie for me that makes me laugh out loud, but I definitely made some a lot noise watching this one! Jack Lemmon gave one of the best performances which I've not ever seen before; add Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, and one hell of a script. All are the best comedian in this movie which makes me a lot of laugh and my whole days goes very best that day.",
419,3 September 2007,mbrg2003,10, Two musicians in trouble go into hiding in an all girls' band.,"""Some Like It Hot"" is supposed to be the funniest movie of all time; I cannot disagree, the movie is hilarious. This is one classic that is worth while, and provides entertainment beginning to end. The trouble starts when Jack Lemon and Tony Curtis witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre and must go into hiding to save their lives. The only escape is joining an all girls' orchestra that is leaving for Florida. It is here that they encounter Marilyn Monroe and vie for her attentions, though they are dressed as women. The plot thickens when they reach their destination and grows more comical. The acting in the film is top notch, including the performances given by actors other than the stars of the movie.",
420,25 February 2017,csenky,10, A mandatory to see for any theater-lover!,"It is sad, that technology does limit what people can enjoy. I myself do not watch old movies either, like the majority, because they lack the tempo and visual enjoyment, that I am used to see. However I have seen some great pieces of art in my childhood, and this motion picture is definitely one of those pieces.",
421,21 November 2005,soup-chef,10, Some Like It Hot - Work of Comedy Geniuses,"This film, among my top 3 is possibly the most innocently hilarious movie ever made. It is one of those films that you can watch a million times and still find the same bits funny as well as others you had never found funny previously. The line ""Pull in your reel Mr. Fielding, you're barking up the wrong fish!"" is possibly the greatest comedy quote ever uttered! And who could possibly forget the slumber party in ""Daphne's"" compartment!",
422,9 August 2018,viccentelles,10, The Best,The best movie I've ever seen. The acting is great and I never get bored by the comedy... So much fun!!!,
423,7 April 2020,Herrguth,8, A Classic,"Charming, funny and cleverly written dialogue.
Great performances and a story that's easy to follow but still takes a few turns with an energetic and charismatic cast.
All the makings of a classic.",
424,13 December 2005,hollybidney,10, Wonderful!,"Voted AFI's funniest comedy (100 Years 100 Laughs) for good reason! You'll have to see this movie multiple times to catch all the little jokes you'll miss the first time. Brilliantly acted, hilarious with one of the best last lines in movie history. Definitely see this classic! OK, I was going to end my comment with that, but apparently I have to have 10 lines of text. Let's see, what else - a little trivia about the movie. Marilyn Monroe originally did not want to take this part, she was sick of the ""ditzy blonde"" roles. So in attempt to not be cast for the role, she gained weight, though she was cast anyway. She was also fighting depression during this time and had a very hard time remembering lines. Not to talk about downers, but there's the trivia, now go see the movie!",
425,3 September 2018,cinedetodotipo,9, One of the best comedies,"Some Like It Hot is a comedy in which it shows how two men (Curtis and Lemmon) have to flee from a mafia band that wants to kill them after having witnessed a horrible crime. Meanwhile, they learn that an orchestra composed solely of women is looking for two components to join them. At first they think that it is not a very viable option, but given their economic situation and the mafia that persecutes them, they do not hesitate to join the musical group disguising themselves as women to go unnoticed. During their stay with the orchestra they will meet Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), the singer of the group and a very passionate young woman.
This film, true masterpiece of the director Billy Wilder, is one of the best comedies thanks to its protagonists Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in which the viewer can have fun all the time. In addition, the fabulous performance of Marilyn Monroe is the icing on the cake and thanks to it has become one of her most famous films. What this film has lacked is that it be in color.",
