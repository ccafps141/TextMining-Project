This review is of the longer ""director's cut.""",/
1,1 July 2002,preppy-3,10, Classic,"This 1988 Italian film (released in the US in 1990), is back with a full 51 minutes added on. This seemed like a stupid idea...there was nothing wrong with the original. The directors cut (which was 1/2 hour longer) was considered a mess. Also, for this release, an extra 1/2 hour was added! I expected the worse. Well, I was pleasantly surprised that this 3 hour version is better than the 2 hour one.",r
2,12 February 2005,caspian1978,10, Every Filmmaker's Favorite Film,"Giuseppe Tornatore's Nuovo cinema Paradiso (Cinema Paradiso) is everything good about the movies. It is a story about love. The love between a Father and Son, an Individual and his home, and the love for the movies. Even if this is not your favorite film, if you are a filmmaker, you have no choice but to say this is your all time favorite film (if not one of the greatest films ever made). If only for the movie's ending, this is a great film. The ending answers all of your questions and completes the story. The missing love from a Man's life. The missing pieces to all the stories (movies) found and made into a whole. The final message from beyond the grave, the ending is perfect. If the musical score doesn't put you in tears, the amazing visuals will push you over the edge. This is what all movies should be about. Terrific.",e
3,19 March 2020,boblipton,10, A Movie For Movie Lovers,"Is there any way for someone who has chosen the movies over life to write anything sensible about this movie for an audience who have made the same choice? I could talk about the way that Philippe Noiret's performance dominates the movie, but he is the only actor who plays his role from start to finish. Certainly, if Giuseppe Tornatore had set out to make a feature intended to win a Best Foreign Picture Oscar, he couldn't have plotted more cannily.",v
4,16 June 1999,doeadear,9, A beautiful film about the love of movies and life,"I continue to be moved and deeply touched by this beautiful film from Italy, and I never tire of watching it. I share the lives of Toto and Alfredo, the small Sicilian boy, who loses his father in the second world war, and the older man who runs the projector at the local cinema. Toto lives in a world of make believe, movies, adventure. His dreams take him away from the small Sicilian village where he lives with his mother and sister. Alfredo becomes for him a surrogate father, and the movies, his paralell existence. It is a deceptively simple film, which sweeps you up and carries you along. You never want it to end. And, when it does end, it is with such heartbreaking simplicity, I cannot help being moved to tears. Young Salvatore Cascio is a marvel as the small Toto, a mischievous, impish, adorable child. Phillipe Noiret is unforgettable as the sly and heart-warming Alfredo. You grow up with Toto, until he becomes a famous film director in Rome, and returns to the small village after many years for Alfredo's funeral. It is the story of life, lost love, devotion, friendship, and family. It is unforgettable.",i
5,30 January 2005,darkside2003,10, A Masterpiece,"I seldom watch Italian movies, (i saw it today for the first time) being Italian maybe i'm biased, but this one really stands out. A real masterpiece; i can't remember another movie so moving like this one, maybe Schindler's list; it makes you laugh and it makes you cry, yet it is so simple and straightforward. Maybe there lies its magic: no Hollywood superstars, no special effects, just pure emotions and feelings, love, fear, grief and regret, nostalgia for childhood and youth, memories of places and times that will not come back, memories of the loved ones. Some movies are there to entertain, some to scare, some to question. This movie is there to affect your feelings. Definitely to be seen.",e

7,29 November 1999,michaelsjmurphy,10, As Good as Movies Get,"Movies can wield a strange power over those who sit in the darkened seats of a theatre.  The truly great ones manipulate your perception of reality, suspend your disbelief, and ultimately either alter or affirm your view on life.  NUOVO CINEMA PARADISO is just such a movie.  It is the near-perfect melding of direction, acting, script, sound track, and cinematography. Phillipe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio give the kind of performances usually associated with much more recognizable actors.  The supporting cast looks like they could all be full-blooded Sicilians.  The location shots add depth and realism to the entire production.  Ennio Morricone's music is simply the most appropriate and emotive I have ever had the pleasure to hear in a theatre.  Tornatore's script and direction are a joy, a breath of fresh air.",/
8,16 May 1999,*DATo*,10, Personal Favorite,"Whether you are a professional or an amateur it is always wise to avoid superlatives with regard to a movie critique ... but I cannot. 'Cinema Paradiso' is simply the finest movie I have ever seen. Like many who have posted at this site before me I have seen it many many times. It reaches within me to places other movies have never reached and I have often wondered why. Perhaps it is because of it's simplicity. It contains no expensive special effects, it has no gratuitous sex or violence, it has no ""multi-millon dollar per performance"" actors that I know of, it is arguable whether it even has a story line, and yet it soars far above the nonsense that film makers are producing these days. It's characters are portrayed by each and every actor in award winning style and the music is not only beautiful but absolutely perfect for this film.",r
9,26 January 2016,Hitchcoc,10, A Film for the Ages,"A village comes to life as a man dreams of a character who directed his entire life. He was a projectionist a run down movie theater which formed the center of entertainment in the community. We are introduced to Toto who lives with his mother who waits for her husband to come home from the Russian front. He is a scalawag who disobeys her and finds ways to spend time with Alfredo, the protectionist. He is in constant trouble but always comes to this man for direction, even though the guy finds him to be a pain in the butt. One night, the movie projector catches fire as does the film (nitrate film did this in the early days) and blinds the old man. Toto becomes the projectionist, even though he is but ten years old. He also becomes the eyes of his friend. He stays at the job, ignoring school, and eventually makes some modest films himself. As he does this, he sees a beautiful young woman with whom he falls in love. This whole film captures the essence of the city. We get to know a multitude of characters because their lives revolve around the movies being shown at the Cinema Paradiso. Toto (not his real name) returns to his home when his mother leaves a message for him that Alfredo has died. He has really cut off ties with the place and it is a painful trip back. But it pulls at our hearts. Things are almost magical. One of the best films every made.",w

11,10 April 2020,krational66,9, Film Heaven,"Youth is a kind of capital, and nostalgia only belongs to the old.
When a world collapses, you always see some people crying and others smiling. It is always the young who laugh, for they look forward and see that the destruction of the old world means the birth of a new world.
I don't know why, after watching ""cinema paradise"", the deepest picture in my mind is that when the cinema collapsed, the smiling faces of the young people, the thunderous applause filled the air of the small town, accompanied by the sigh of the old people.
Heaven belongs to the nostalgic, because it is a simple and innocent ideal of the past. The past is a dream, that's why it's beautiful. Time will beautify all cruel things, to wear a hazy veil of pain.
The old evert said to the young saverto, ""you are so young, the world is yours. And I'm old. I don't want to listen to you any more. I want to hear people talk about you. ""Such a sincere piece of heart, hidden, but all is a vision of the future. Only youth is always looking forward, in the long stream of time, is a little optimism and hope for the faith.
So saverto left, with lost love and a broken heart, never to return.
If there is no expectation of the eternal, then love is just a dream, but, leave that little expectation, life from then on to bear such a heavy cross.
The immortal cross, how could savertu not understand? The 30 dazzling years in the movie are actually 30 365 days in real life. Cut out the banal, trivial, realistic details, so that the past 30 years ago is such a beautiful story.
Unfortunately, that's just the story.
Children always love fairytales. They have no past and have no time to remember their short life. They expect to hear the ending that the prince and princess live happily ever after. When young, is never to think, in fact, the end is just a beginning, and the real end, is writing behind the endless trivial and trouble.
The king may also die in battle one day, leaving the widowed queen alone. Their children may be demented. Somewhere in the palace garden, love is rotting. One day, when all the people are old, only the wrinkles of the eyes are still flashing a little clear light, perhaps only then, is to write the real ending time.
But everyone did not like to hear such stories, young people, happy to witness the birth of a new world, but do not want to go to the old world that was full of joy. When we go to remember, perhaps, our hearts have been old.
I guess I do.",2
12,5 February 2005,phaneendrakumar,10, Great movie.. with excellent background.,This movie definitely is one of my all time best movies. Director Giuseppe Tornatore placed himself in the list of the best directors. The usage of an excellent background score is a trademark of his movies and this movie is not at all a different case.,7
13,5 March 2014,ma-cortes,7, Stunning film with great sense and sensibility ; being compellingly directed by Giuseppe Tornatore,"Colorful and moving flick dealing with a wonderful friendship between a little boy and a solitary projectionist . However , being overly nostalgic , too sentimental and overwhelmingly sweet . Attractive and sensitive picture with stirring drama , ravishing cinematography and enjoyable musical score . A filmmaker (Jacques Perrin , he subsequently became a notorious director) recalls his childhood (Salvatore Cascio , Toto , who celebrated his eighth birthday during filming) , when he fell in love with the movies at his village's theater and formed a deep friendship with the theater's projectionist (Philippe Noiret who said all his lines in French) at Cinema Paradise . The director goes back home to his Sicilian village for the first time after almost 30 years and is reminded of his first love (Antonella Attili) . ",7
14,12 July 2006,planktonrules,10, About as good an Italian film as you can find,"With the exception of a few of De Sica's films during the Neorealist days of the 40s and 50s, I think this is the finest Italian film I have seen. It is highly reminiscent of Fellini's Amarcord, though even better (and that's saying a lot), because it offers a wonderful and nostalgic look back at how life used to be. And, it is told so gently and affectionately that you can't help but love the film and the characters. The film is named after the local theater because it is the focal point for this community through the many years the film encompasses. Gentle, beautiful and full of humor and grace--this is a wonderful film for pretty much the entire family and you can't help but admire all those associated with it.",1
15,7 February 2021,stevelivesey67,10, A Perfect Movie,"Genius, masterpiece, (insert superlative here).

16,24 November 2006,lee_eisenberg,10, In memory of Philippe Noiret,"Philippe Noiret's death yesterday brings to mind all his movies, including ""Nuovo cinema Paradiso"". The first time that I saw this was right after I had seen ""The Postman"", and I recognized him as the man who had played Pablo Neruda. Here, he plays an equally great role, of the operator of a camera in a movie theater in an Italian village in years past. His friendship with and advice to young Salvatore proves to be more than the boy could have ever dreamed about. In a sense, the movie seems to be a look not only at what Italy was, but also what going to the movies was. It's definitely a masterpiece that I recommend. There may be the issue of whether or not we should make Italy's past look so idealistic, given that Mussolini was in power at the time. But I would assert that this movie shows that even in times of oppression, people can find ways to escape it. A really good movie.",4
17,8 October 2012,paul2001sw-1,7, Celluloid nostalgia,"To those of us who live in places less beautiful than Sicily, and which have lost connection with their peasant heritage much longer ago, there's a natural appeal to stories from that island. 'Cinema Paradiso' provides a nostalgic look at post-war Sicily, and also of Italian cinema during that era; in the story of how progress led to television, the death of the cinema as a social institution and the individualisation of people's lives, it recalls 'The Last Picture Show'. There's similarity as well in the conflict between attachment to one's community and the desire to escape, although it lacks Peter Bogdanovich's film's sense of overwhelming claustrophobia. Indeed, the emotional temperature of the film is actually quite muted, in spite of the surface colour and vigour. I enjoyed it, but (especially in a setting with such a complex historical and political backdrop) it could have benefited from a shade more intensity.",/

20,25 December 2004,davspin,10, Profoundly important movie,"Cinema Paradiso is a profoundly important movie because it deals with identifiable emotions/issues that could be considered universal on so many levels. The entire story is retrospective similar to Fellini's style as well as a love story that pulls in the viewer on an emotional level. The film also attempts to expose an inkling of Sicilian life, language,(different from Italian) and how ""history"" has intruded upon and shaped the mentality of the Sicilian people; to also show that traditional concepts of what is ""moral"" or right is not to be taken for granted because of the people and their particular history. For those who do not fancy history or non-fiction, the film attempts to educate the ""outsider"" not familiar with Sicilian history as it pertains to the WWII era. I watch it again and again and see more and more details that pertain to the story. I did see it on the big screen at a local theater back in 1991 and it was a hit with the audience. I have several scenerio that I think could make it more interesting and am very curious about the uncut version and what is different about it. Finally, the movie does make me cry because it is after all a love story and it is clear at the end that Toto (aka Salvatore)is still in love with Elena and that is why he never married or settled down ""..to love one person. . . "" as his mother says to him after his 30 year absence from home. The final scene of the credits also shows him looking at Elena again and the look on his face is telling. This film has many little ""hints"" that serve to inform the viewer and give just a little more info. about the story. Truly, one of the best films I have ever seen !!! These characters come alive and we feel like we know them--personally. Viva Giuseppe Tornatore for his masterpiece!",e

24,14 March 2021,PIST-OFF,9, Wished I'd seen this when I was younger.,"This movie is wonderful. It really captures a sense of nostalgia many of us harbor in our own lives. I don't know why I put off seeing it for so long. A little boy grows up loving movies (movie people in their narcissism love movies about movies) and is mentored by an older guy who sees big things in the kid's future. A rose tinted view of youth, love, and times that never seem to stop changing is what follows and a wonderful story it makes for. One of the few movies to get a grasp on childhood along with Stand By Me, The Sandlot, and a few others. Another movie that could benefit greatly from an English dub, as too many people are too likely to avoid subtitles at all costs.",t
25,10 November 2017,richard-1787,10, A movie about being infatuated with movies,"I first saw this movie back in 1988 in Italy, when it came out there.

27,9 August 2014,classicsoncall,9," ""Friends, this cinema is for you.""","A sincere love of film and attention to detail is readily apparent in director Giuseppe Tornatore's ""Cinema Paradiso"". I was struck by the many creative elements employed in the picture, like Alfredo's (Philippe Noiret) decision to broadcast a movie on the side of a building and how the mother's crocheting unraveled as she went to answer the door for the returning Salvatore near the end of the picture. Earlier, when Salvatore/Toto was still a child and anxious about his father returning from the War, his mother's response was ""It takes years to go there (Russia), years to come back"". But then when it was confirmed that the father died in the War, the pair pass by an advertisement for 'Via Col Vento' - ""Gone With the Wind"". For young Toto, it was as if his father never even existed.",u

From the camera, the direction, the sound, the acting, through the story it tells and the overall atmosphere, to the emotions it arouses, ""Nuovo Cinema Paradiso"" is simply mesmerizing. There is not too much drama, or humor, or mystery here, no tension, no brainstorming. But there is magic, magic of life, and magic of cinema, which intertwine in the heart of a boy. ""Nuovo Cinema Paradiso"" is a relaxing feast for the senses, which fills the heart and soul. It is full of symbolism, but it is so lovely that I do not want to analyze it in any way. Just turn off the lights, sit back comfortably and enjoy your own experience of this timeless masterpiece.",v
30,30 April 2006,whpratt1,10, A Film for Real Movie Lovers,"This film touched my very heart and soul from the very beginning to the end. As a young boy I went to the movie theater with my Mom every Friday afternoon at the Lefferts Theater on Liberty Ave., in Richmond Hill, N.Y. and grew to love all the films just as the young boy in this film. It is very easy to see why this film received so much wonderful praise and awards. There was plenty of funny comedy when the Roman Catholic Priest censored all the films shown in the theater that showed any form of kissing or physical contact between a male or female. It was a great down to earth film which words cannot describe fully, and can only be appreciated by people who love to escape into the World of Film and stories. The Actors, Producers and Directors out did themselves with this great masterpiece of JOY. By the way, when I attended those Friday afternoon showing of films with Mom, she also received a free plate or dish to go with her set of matching dinner dishes.",
31,11 May 2005,Anonymous_Maxine,10," A celebration of what the movies were, are, and hopefully can be again.","From beginning to end, Cinema Paradiso is, of course, about various forms of love, but my favorite element of the story is not just the way movies are portrayed, but the way old movies are portrayed. I have a particular fondness of older films (and a particular distaste for the shallow, exploitative and unimaginative garbage constantly cranked out by Hollywood these days), and one of the biggest themes of this film is the loss of purity and truth and innocence that movies once had.",

It is wonderful in the first half and the cinema with the boy and his love of the clips, the cuts and the whole of his childhood, the projector, the man and his magic and his helping to as well. The splendid scenes of the cinema and the children and the adults are just as thrilling. As the boy gets older and falls in love it starts to get a bit too sentimental and later as him older it is really not as good at all. I find that the old cinema magic has gone and just too schmaltzy.",
33,2 January 2015,Marc_Israel_365,6, The movie nostalgia faded before the movie ended,"I so wanted to be engrossed by a film about a filmmakers romance with his villages movie theater and their projectionist. I wanted it to validate my own love of escapism, so wonderfully woven by incredibly directors who take us to such wonderful places that even our imagination couldn't have dreamed of. With such a grandiose name, the (lack of) family, village square, theater and boorish patrons fell short of endearing and, at times, fell short on many levels. Meaningful bits went on too long carried to 1970's made for TV levels by a overindulgent soundtrack. The actors played their parts, but with such inconsistent overdubbing, I felt for none of them. Yes the boy and projectionist bit was sweet, but not enough to carry the film. The older Totos' added no depth to the little boy. Conceptually nice and the scenes reenacting the crowds reaction to the theater and its limitations worked even if they were crude, but did we find a way to connect to movies as a character. I don't believe it was introduced until the final scene evidenced the character shunned from them by the church and I just couldn't relate, just like the film",

Certainly its probably the greatest film about the love of film the medium has ever produced. It is not a flawless film, the romance in the latter half of the film isn't as strong as everything else and it weakens, some what the rest of the film. Even so I wouldn't change a frame of the film. I love the Ennio Morricone score, which is haunting even now three years since I last saw the film. If you love movies see this film, its a glorious tribute to life in the cinema, as maker, projector and most of all watcher.

However, it must be noted that the three central performances are beyond reproach: the child Salvatore (played with rascally charm by Salvatore Cascio), the brusque projectionist Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) and the adolescent Salvatore (Marco Leonardi). All three are masterful in creating the viewer's emotional attachment to these characters. The relationship between the tough but tender projectionist and the little boy is what carries the first half of the film and it continues when the boy becomes a lovesick adolescent. It is only the last half of the film that seems to drag a little with scenes of the adult Salvatore (Jacques Perrin)contemplating returning to the little village where he grew up in the shadows of the movie theater and those wonderful silver shadows on the screen.",

People who don't like foreign movies like this one because, if you take away the Italian subtitles, this film is as fake and schlocky as the worst piece of sentimental clap-trap churned out by the Hollywood myth-making machine.

Cudos to the great Ennio Morricone & son Andrea. Many reviewers insist that the shorter, theatrical-release version is superior to the director's cut. The full-length version makes a central character morally ambiguous, in contrast to the uniformly benevolent father figure depicted in the shorter version. In the long version this character commits an act similar to but far crueler than the behavior of another character who is ridiculed early on. Most new viewers will watch the full-length film. The shorter version is more satisfying for those who secretly prefer fairy tales in which the good guys & bad guys are consistently good guys & bad guys.

A film which perfectly captures the obsessive and domineering power cinema has over its dedicated fans and their lives. In the manner of how the picture's protagonist Toto becomes enchanted and engulfed by the movies, Cinema Paradiso is a movie which succeeds in doing just that. Cinema Paradiso takes the viewer back to a time when the movie theatre was at the heart of a community, where people would even have sex in the middle of a crowded theatre and teenage boys would engage in acts of self-pleasure to what was on screen (must be a European thing), or alternatively, many would just go to enjoy a nap. Cinema Paradiso is my favourite Italian film but also my favourite film not in the English language, and what a rich experience it is. Even the Italian people's over-the-top, histrionic nature is hugely entertaining - now that's a good-a pizza pie! The music, scenery and vibrant architecture of the village of Giancaldo on the island of Sicily immediately draw me in with the stone buildings, fountains, cobblestone streets and wide open squares free of automobiles. This contrasts with the film's latter scenes set in the modern day, where modernity has replaced a world in which the influence on Ancient Rome still lingered and instead with something more superficial and ugly.",

Alfredo should be all of us, with constant, permanent love for one another while asking for nothing in return. Very very beautiful. I still cry every time I hear the final scene movie.

59,12 November 2012,jboothmillard,9, Cinema Paradiso,"Many of the films listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die have interesting and good sounding titles, including the foreign language ones, and this Italian one I was very intrigued by because it sounded like something I would love, and it was rated well by the critics. Basically, in 1980s Rome, Salvatore 'Toto' Di Vita (Jacques Perrin) is a famous and successful Italian film director. Returning home late one night, his sleepy girlfriend tells him that his mother telephoned to tell him that someone called Alfredo has died. It is obvious he has shied away from committed relationships and his family in Giancaldo, Sicily, the story flashes back thirty years to see who Alfredo was. After the Second World War, highly intelligent and mischievous six-year-old Salvatore 'Toto' Di Vita (BAFTA winning Salvatore Cascio) has a love for films. He spends most of his time going to the local movie house, Cinema Paradiso, and gets to know the projectionist Alfredo (BAFTA winning Philippe Noiret), who for a while finds his presence annoying and he gets frustrated. Slowly though Alfredo takes a shine to Toto and they form a close friendship, as the projectionist allows him to watch movies from the projection booth, and he teaches him how to load and operate the film projector because of his fascination with his work. They often hear the audience boo when sections of films are missing, especially those where characters in the movies are embracing romance with kissing. The film jumps these moments, as the scenes have been cut out, under the orders of local priest Father Adelfio (Leopoldo Trieste) who wants the films ""censored"", all of the scenes are piled on the projection room floor. One night one of the movies, made of the routine highly flammable Nitrate film, catches fire and causes some of the movie house to burn, Toto notices this and manages to save Alfredo's life, but consequently an explosion burned Alfredo's face and permanently blinds him. Eventually Cinema Paradiso is rebuilt by town citizen Ciccio who invests his football winnings, as the only capable hand, Toto is made projectionist. A decade passes, adolescent Salvatore 'Toto' Di Vita (Marco Leonardi) is now in high school and still a projectionist at the ""Nuevo Cinema Paradiso"". He still has a strong relationship with blind Alfredo, he often takes his advice about his personal life, such as being in love, and this advice is given with him quoting classic movies. Toto has started experimenting in his own filmmaking using his home movie camera, while doing this he sees and is attracted to wealthy banker's daughter Elena Mendola (Agnese Nano). He wins her heart with his charm, but her father does not approve and forces them apart, and when her family is moving away at the same time it is compulsory that Toto serves in military service. While there he tries to communicate with Elena with letters, but they are returned undeliverable, when he eventually returns Alfredo is urging him to leave Giancaldo permanently with no explanation. He says he wants him to achieve his dreams for filmmaking, the town is not big enough, and if he does pursue his ambition he should go and never return, and never write. Back in the present, Salvatore is desperate to return to Giancaldo for the funeral of his friend, he finds that the town has changed a lot, and he finds out why he was told to leave. Salvatore is told by Alfredo's widow that he followed his film directing career with high interest and pride, his dying gifts to his friend are an unlabelled reel of film and the stool that he operated the projector on. The sad news is that the Cinema Paradiso is being demolished to make way for parking spaces, many of the people in the village gather to watch as the building comes down, many of whom Toto recognises. The end of the film sees Salvatore return home to Rome, he takes the reel of film he was given by Alfredo to a cinema, as it plays he discovers it is every romantic scene cut (including The Gold Rush and His Girl Friday) by the priest, put together in a special montage, in floods of happy tears Salvatore has made peace with his past. Also starring Pupella Maggio as old Maria Di Vita, Antonella Attili as young Maria Di Vita, Isa Danieli as Anna, Enzo Cannavale as Spaccafico, Nicola Di Pinto as Village Idiot, Roberta Lena as Lia and Nino Terzo as Peppino's Father. Noiret gives a really nice performance as the initially grumpy but then absolutely lovable projectionist who is an inspiration to his young friend, and the supporting cast members all do their parts well also, especially Cascio as the child filmmaker that grows up to achieve this ambition. The story is easy to follow, the characters are lovable, the plot lines inside and outside the cinema are interesting and fun, if you are a big fan of watching films, this picture really expresses the magic of escaping the everyday world and entering the spirit of movie going, it is a most enjoyable drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, it won the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language, Best Original Film Score for Ennio Morricone and Andrea Morricone and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Direction for Giuseppe Tornatore, Best Editing, Best Make Up Artist and Best Production Design, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.

It also works because for all the sentiment, he makes it a story essentially about a boy, Toto, without a father after the war who finds a surrogate-cum-mentor with Alfredo, the projectionist at the theater. Their bond makes for the emotional core of the film, as the grown-up Toto comes back to the town he left so long ago for Alfredo's funeral, and looks back on his childhood and adolescence in this small down of Giacardola.",

At the very least, if you must watch the director's cut, I urge you, no, I implore you, to make sure you watch the 123 min version first.

There's something of the Pagnols about it as Tornatore creates a whole community and peoples it with living, breathing people, just as Pagnol before him did with the Midi.

Salvatore Di Vita has become a successful film maker in Rome and hasn't been home in 30 years. Alfredo was the projectionist for the cinema. He befriends young Sal nicknamed Toto. Alfredo becomes more like a father figure to Toto since his father died in World War II. We watch Sal's life as reflects upon the loss of Alfredo. The film has a great cast and crew. It's absolutely heartbreaking by the end. The cast is superb with Jacques Perrin as the older Sal. I don't cry but I did today. It takes a lot for me to cry. Ennui Morricone provides the magic musical score. He is a genius. The original score is breathtaking and unforgettable.,

Nearly two decades later, as I have gotten older and closer to the adult Salvatore's age, I have softened considerably in my opinion of the film, an open-hearted tribute to cinema and its transcendent impact on people's lives. Granted it is awash in sentimentality, but with its unique combination of storytelling elements inspired in equal parts by Chaplin and Fellini, there is a burnished, nostalgic glow to the whole venture as most of it is designed as a flashback.",

In fact, it somehow makes you feel nostalgic for something you never even experienced. Framed as a trip into memory, the movie charts the formative years of Toto as he grows up in and around a thriving small-town cinema and strikes up a friendship with a coarse but kind-hearted projectionist. The picture does a great job in conveying the passage of time, with its eponymous picture-house going through as many - if not more - changes as its core characters. Though it does occasionally drag and, generally, has the tendency to meander, the experience is an oddly affecting one that remains engaging throughout. It has a palpable texture to it, too. Helped immensely by a stand-out (if somewhat repetitive) score from Ennio Morricone, the movie transports you to a distinct place and time in an almost melancholic way. It's by no means dour - in fact, it's often rather funny - but it definitely has more than tinge of regret to it. In the end, it can almost entirely be described as one thing: nostalgic. 7/10",

Even worse: the films of his youth are presented as escapist daydreams, but his entire life (revealed in flashback from childhood to middle age) is no less an illusion, transformed by nostalgia into a heart tugging, romantic tearjerker.

104,18 December 1998,thepetshopboy,10, My all-time favorite,"The most gratifying piece of film making I have ever seen, ""Paradiso"" is one of the few films that I can watch time and again.  Director Tornatore brings a passion to the film which seeps out of every frame and invites the viewer to revisit their youth, their hopes, their dreams and the crushing truth of reality.  You will not see a more beautiful, haunting film than this. Phillipe Noiret gives the performance of his life (one which he played a subtle riff on in "" Il Postino"") and Ennio Morricone's score ranks right up there as his best.  For true junkies like myself I would highly recommend getting a hold of the director's cut in which an additional 50 minutes of material is added.  While as a whole it is not as good a movie (Tornatore clearly needed a forceful editor) it does provide insight into what happeneed to Toto's beloved Elena and surprises viewers with a heart-wrenching plot twist which was cut from the original.",

It contains about everything that the cinema is about (or maybe better: once was), and more. Tornatore also wrote the screenplay for this film and it can be felt throughout that the material comes from his heart, drawing from own experiences and those related to him - the director even has a cameo appearance as a projectionist in the final minutes. ""Cinema Paradiso"" is as powerful as it is not only because of its topic, the direction and the screenplay, but also because of its scope - spanning the whole lifetime of the main character -, its memorable imagery, Ennio Morricone's brilliant score and of course the carefully chosen cast headed by Philippe Noiret. By the way: Even grandmaster Fellini might have made it into the movie, intended for the role of the mentioned projectionist at the very end. But he replied to the director's request: ""At such an important part of the movie putting a face so bulky like mine could be distracting to the audience. I suggest an unknown person instead: Let Tornatore do it!"" Well, so we've still got a master of cinema up there at least - the one who made ""Cinema Paradiso"".",

Its focus is the power of love to shape our lives over the long term. The protagonist's passion for the cinema and his youthful immersion in ""first love"" are intertwined, and become mutual symbols each for the other. What constitutes success and what failure? What is or must be sacrificed to achieve our goals, and how are we to know in advance which life goals will prove worthy and enduring? All these dilemmas move beneath the surface of an engaging tale, but without detracting from its drama. Let me point out too an important word of warning that may be missed: When an adult's help and guidance of a young person, no matter how lovingly offered, crosses the line to making decisions for them without their knowledge or consent, the consequence often may be suffering for which no one would have wished.",

Movies that after the first few scenes you know that, regardless the development of the plot, you're now become completely involved with the story and the characters. You are *in* the story. It is often said that great movies are the ones that manage to convince the public that what they are seeing is reality, that the spell they cast is so well-carved that you don't notice that on the other side of the screen there's actors who leave their characters after the director shouts ""stop"", and people who work on the make-up, lightning, script.

How would this story unfold? How would the passions be released?

Of course, everything passes, and cinema has gone through many phases, it has undergone metamorphoses, and the end of the great classic movie theaters was one of them. And now?

This is a film about a boy growing up in the vicinity of a movie theater. On the background there is a war ongoing but the episodes of the film don't make much connection to it. Story is a bit boring at least from a Finnish point of view.. Only one or two episodes made me smile a bit but the humor isn't too intelligent. Maybe this film is good for some people that can imagine beyond what is shown. For me; characters didn't matter much. Music is more happy than melancholic and I could probably compose something more touching.. :D.

154,20 April 2008,arthera09,7," heard great things about this film, but","I heard great things about this film and never would have watched it, but it came highly recommended. I did enjoy the film, but I watched the directors cut which was close to pushing 3 hours. I am not sure what got added, but I think a lot of the films power was lost with additional scenes that slowed the pace down. I loved the idea and I got the message, but I just did not feel it at the end. There were scenes that I loved and they made me smile and there are some great lines, but in the end I did not feel that it was terribly inventive and did not create that sense of awe and love that I have for cinema. I loved the scene when Elena comes back during the showing of the movie in the outdoor cinema and it starts raining. It was cliché, but it worked and was perfect for the movie. It has always been hard for me to enjoy movies about the love of movies because I feels as if few of them can capture the emotion that we as viewers derive from movies. I think part of the reason I missed some of the movie was it was only recently that I really started enjoying movies. Growing up I did not really look forward to watching them and they were nothing special. The love story aspect of the movie was weak in my opinion and did not need to be fleshed out as much as it was. I would have liked to have imagined that they just missed each other and not it told me exactly how it happened. I also guess I did not agree with Alfredo's idea that he could never return and that Toto was bound for greatness and that could only be achieved with a complete separation from his roots. Going back and revisiting the past at an early point of his life might have brought Toto more closure, I know it did for me. I know this movie is rated really high in the all time list and I am not sure if I agree with it, but I don't think I saw the version that most people voted for. Also I think I was lost on the fact that I did not know any of the movies that were shown in the theater at any point, which is in a way sad to me.",

The casting is perfect. Indeed, there is a maturation of the boy to a young man and finally an adult. He is adorable as a child, and rugged as an adolescent. When finally he becomes a prominent film director, he charms the audience with his looks as well as his pensive stare. There are moments of laughter that help to relieve the tension of a passionate love story. The The cinematography is displayed to perfection. The colors are a very attractive pastel that blends with the Itallian surroundings. All of the film shots in the movie house in his small town and captivating. This film is a must see to all serious moviegoers, and it should be placed at the top of one's list of films. It is definitely ""two thumbs up"" in the Hollywood vernacular.

This part of the film is very sweet and is full of little moments like the town bonding, the boy sneaking into the projection room, the projectionist talking about his life and more. This all gives a well-rounded view of the boy's life and environment, which feels warm and true to life. The acting of the boy and the projectionist must be commended for a sense of genuine warmth. After a time skip, the young boy becomes a young man who takes over the projection booth. By this point, the repetition of the extended director's cut really starts to show badly. His desperate attempts at romance come across as annoying to watch. This really leads to confusion by the next time skip when she happily reunites with him.

It also touches on the fact that in life we have to give some things up to achieve others.  Cinema Paradiso hasone of the greatest endings in any film, a beautiful montage of light and film imagery.  To this day it grabs something in my soul and lifts it.  This is a film for parents to watch with children, friends to show each other and lovers to bond over.

Director Giuseppe Tornatore created a nice Italian and original story about a typical cinema in the 40/50ies that was located in South Italy. The little boy and Philippe Noiret did a great job here but every actor made a solid casting. Sometimes I had some nostalgic thoughts about my own country.

The film is set in Italy in the early years of cinema. It is about a young boy named Salvatore (who is nicknamed Toto) who daily goes to the theaters to watch movies. He becomes friends with the projectionist named Alfredo. The two of them bond and Alfredo teaches Salvatore about film and how to use the projector and the film shows their friendship and Salvatore's life and how he grows up and the impact film and Alfredo has had on him.

Before I start my review let me say that the version I saw of the film was the original version running at 121 minutes. A year or two ago a new version was released with extra footage that runs about 174 minutes. One of the reasons I saw Cinema Paradiso was because I always read good things about it and it is often talked and praised about on different movie sites and message boards. Another reason that I saw this film was when I was in a small independent video store once that carried a lot of foreign, independent and offbeat films. I saw this film on the shelf and on the corner there was a note from one of the workers of the store that said something like ""This is the reason I opened this store"". After reading many good reviews and after reading this note I decided to see the film. Cinema Paradiso has good direction, a good script, good performances from the two main actors and a good supporting cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing and good production design. The film is a good looking film and it is sweet and touching. The film has a nice story and nice characters that you begin to care about and you want to see how the film progresses and what happens to them. This is a film that I think people young and old will enjoy because it is a coming of age story and it will appeal to many.

Almost 30 years later I revisited Cinema Paradiso (I also saw the released director's cut version somewhere in between) and experienced a slightly different response to a film that I originally enjoyed unconditionally. I still enjoyed it immensely and continued to be touched by its expressions of love for the art of film, the love of love itself, community, family, and tradition. Ennio Moriccone's score still hit my ears as beautifully lyrical and melancholy as ever, only this time I noticed its indulgent overuse. I noticed many of the Italian film cliches that I somehow either didn't notice or instantly forgave in my youth. Despite noticing Tornatore's many indulgences I remain a fan of Cinema Paradiso and yes, I too find the ending scene very moving. I would like to add that I did not enjoy the longer director's version and if you're only going to see one or the other that you stick with the original US release version.",

Simple characters build around a theater only source of entertainment for people in a small province of Italy during WW II period, and a love story of main character first with movies, then with a girl, is simply beautiful, especially the passion of the kid with movies, is simply astounding. Another relationship depicted in the movie that of Toto and Alfredo is beautifully developed and equally well played by actors (3 played Toto, kid, young and mature old). The Kid artist who played Toto is amazing and played the role with equal panache as does the Alfredo. Other various artists are good in their roles, well suited. Music is very good and blends with every scene very well. Direction is superb and the photography too is top-notch, dialog's too are very well written. Watching crowd in the theater watching cinema is a pleasure moment for me as a viewer, it takes me back to old days when I use to enjoy a movie so much in theater, now its usually on TV, DVD, theater magic is not like that anymore. 10/10, must watch, irrespective of foreign language.

A movie about cinema, friendship and love, about surviving and thriving, about living with what we have and still be happy with it. A flashback to a happy and eventful childhood that makes Salvatore Di Vita, incredibly played by Salvatore Cascio as a young boy, a successful Italian filmmaker, go back to his hometown, after years of isolation in Rome. A childhood where he learned the art of cinema together with Alfredo, a beautiful portrait by Philippe Noiret (don't forget to watch Il Postino).
A recollection of memories that show us that life is worth to be lived as long as we stay close to the ones we love, that we care and allow ourselves to be part of something that is bigger than our egos.

But if you do you'd know the story line quite well by then, I won't help you very much. My comment is more of an ""homage"" to Philipe Noiret whom I keep calling Jean Noiret? Who passed away 2 days ago and so creates a big vacuum to fill in the cinema industry. Reading a few comments I was rather surprise to see no reference to Philipe Noiret as a French person in an Italian movie. This shocked me almost as much as I recognised him when I went to see this wonderful and quite talked about movie in Sydney (yes Australia) open air screening in the city botanic garden, (I think during the Sydney Festival that is the month of January...some years ago). One comment I read, said ""Phillipe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio give the kind of performances usually associated with much more recognizable actors. Is it very french to feel like sneering at such a remark? Perhaps but I do so without hard feeling just realising that in this (Bill Gate) anglophone world it's excusable; but also feel so privileged to have had some 20 years of french culture before leaving it for ever. Well! August 2011 and I decided to put my VHS tape onto a DVD As I watched a little of the dubbing I was very stirred by this lovely story. I guess if my dubbing is not to perfect it won't matter as a little aging is very much in the grain anyway. I was amazed, whilst reading some more reviews about it, that some people could find it ""cliche"" and or boring, most other reviews were so full of compliments about it as I think this story deserves.

The story is told mostly inside the Cinema house with a few shots of Rome to build the story. There is a sublime intricacy and mystery to this story that does not manifest till the end.

While continuing to show this leaf, the camera begins to slowly dolly backwards into a home. At the end of the dolly shot lays a basket of fruitimplicating that every human life begins as a small and humble seed. Through a progression of time (suggested through the dolly movement), the seed grows, developments, and eventually becomes a basket of fruit. In other words, time is what allows people to grow into something more mature as they learn to bring forth the fruits of their labors.",

The passage of rites of young Salvatore through his boyhood to eventually becoming a cynical adult just like most of us - all with the small Italian village cinema as it's backdrop, is a majestic work of art. It conveys us the viewer to the simple ways of life, to experience all aspects of human emotion and be transported there as only the cream of films can do.

And because the beginning of the movie already showed us the end ... there wasn't much surprise anyway. The classic last scene (watching the reel) was - for me - so annoyingly repetitive ... and i truly didn't get it !
But then i checked about Cinema Paradiso and learnt there was a Director's Cut; and from what i read, the Director's Cut really gives a lot of sense to the last scene. The deleted parts really give content to the last message of Alfredo to Toto.
Finally, i believe the film was awarded because of the Director's Cut version, not the theatrical one. (Or else i would agree with paulclaassen (20 December 2019), this is a movie for movie buffs and nostalgic of the older era of cinematography, which explains the long list of awards and the status of ""classic"" for this movie)",

The film's duration seems too long, only because one thinks that this movie is about childhood upon viewing its first half, while in truth, it is rather a biography. It does seem, though, as if the director just cared more about the film's ending, rather than the film in its entirety and that he aims at our sensitivity in order to make us sentimental and wet-eyed so that we *like* the film.

I remember renting the video many years ago and being taken by its flow that merged a coming of age theme of a young boy captured by cinema in an Italian town and his friendship with the theater operator.  The operator was a somewhat mentor for the boy, and the film created an envelope around us -- the viewers -- as we watched a story on three parts.  These parts were that of the young boy, that of the same man as a teenage, and that of the same as a mature adult who returns to town thirty years later.  Once viewed, you must think about how your were manipulated by the director to actually be part of the film itself as you laughed at those in the film who emoted and cried, and yet at the end we, too, were that same audience.",

I watched both of them and I just want to say that their is no point in watching shorter version after all you have to see longer version anyway because you don't want to miss out even a bit of what this movie is about. The last conversation with grown up Toto and his old mother made me wept and it was so real and genuine it sends shivering in me. A movie has everything in it, Toto's kid life story that has school life, street life, home life and social life and as an adolescent everything around him has been shown and of course the grown up Toto is just awesome. Alfredo is another character in the movie who is so impressive and real. One thing I liked about the movie is that director has done a marvelously job of keeping thing connected.

336,9 May 1999,Paul-250,8, A Hymn To Cinema,"Cinema Paradiso is a film about growing-up as much as it is a homage to the cinema; the pains of growing-up, the compromises and, eventually, the separation that it involves from those we love and the familiar surroundings that have helped to shape us. And in a real sense, despite what Varlaam (in an earlier comment) said about 120 minute popcorn ads, it acknowledges the role of film as fantasy, a fantasy that cannot last. But what a beautiful fantasy! Anyone who knows Italy well will recognise the emotional warmth that permeates the film, and in that sense, like Fellini's Amarcord, the film is inescapably Italian. But it is also universal in it's acknowledgement of loss through the inevitability of change. This is a beautiful homage to cinema, but also to the ties of friendship and community that help people to develop as fully-rounded human beings. That we see little of what the townspeople do is not the point. We don't need to. One advantage of films like Cinema Paradiso and Belle Epoque is that they may encourage many people to watch subtitled films, and to appreciate that a film robbed of it's original language and sounds is a film castrated. To those unaccustomed to subtitles, that alone is a reason for seeing this wonderful film.",
337,4 February 2020,Andy_MJD,8, Nuovo Cinema Paradiso,"A truly heart-wreching story about a boy growing up, and his lack of a father figure filled in by the old man who never has kids. I heard that in the extended version he meets back up with the love interest for one final night. I find this useless, if not in fact contradictory to the story: the point isn't about the boy and the girl. It's about the boy and the man. The love interest doesn't work out by the end of it, we know that since it's mentioned that he's with a different girl every time the mother calls. But frankly that wasn't why the movie was powerful. It was a great story, almost from the point of view of the town, since the boy leaves but we never know about any of his life (or very very little) outside of the town. What he does, what he likes, what part of town he lives in. Just like the old man, we shouldn't even want to know. It doesn't concern us.

Cinema paradiso is regarded as not only one of the greatest Italian films ever exported, but one of the greatest foreign films ever! But I would strongly disagree, as far as to say it is an insult to label this majestic testament to the beauty life, as just a foreign film! It's more than that, much more. A story told in flash backs, from the perspective of a highly successful film maker in his 40's (Salvatore Cascio). Upon receiving a call from his mother to inform him that his child hood hero had unfortunately died, it forces him to recount his entire youth. Telling the story of a young Salvatore living in a run down, poverty stricken and grim war-torn, post ww2 Sicilian village with his baby sister and his harassed mother who is as free with a slap as with a hug. But finding refuge from all the pain and misery, in a cinema paradiso, a local picture hall, provides him with an idyllic paradise where his love for cinema and adventures can run free. There he soon strikes up an unshakable life long bond with a aging projectionist, serving as a father figure and confidante, then after a fire robes him of his sight, Alfredo (Philippe Noriet) encourages Salvatore to take over at the new paradiso, but eventually he would push the now young 18 year old Salvatore, tainted by his first heartbreak by his true love Elena(Agnese Nano), out of the confines of this dead beat village, to a world waiting to be explored and conquered , Only returning 30 years later, to witness the burial of Alfredo and the demolition of the cinema paradiso. Giuseppe Tornatore provides us with a poignant and almost, spiritual reminder of how the simple things that we held so delicately in are youths can almost be forgotten and misplace in our older years, as we replace the magic with vain perceptions of success and obsession with money, when we should actually try and reconnect with our youths, and again enjoy the personal cinema experience that promises so much. As soon as the end titles rolled by, I couldn't help but feel sad, as a big cinema paradiso shaped whole was left in my heart.

341,2 March 2021,judemcrobbie,9, Memorably touching,"One of the most touching movies so far. Many movies talk about obsession, usually in a negative light, however this places obsession on a pedestal showing it as a drive through life rather than how it pulls you down like others.
As with once upon a time in Hollywood (2019) this movie is a love letter to movies and how they have clearly affected the writer and director. No movie grasps this concept like this, making us adore the movies and see them as a separate character.
It gives you the warm and fuzzy feeling like it's a wonderful life (1946) but without the ending left up to chance it gives the movie space to grow in your mind.
The final scene is so beautifully crafted as it feels like the final act all summed up together in a beautiful bundle, which would or should bring any viewer to tears as it creates an impact on the audience undreamed of. On top of that it feels like a microcosm of the whole movie as it pulls elements from everywhere to create, what I'd deem, the perfect final scene.",

First time around, this film was a wonderful experience. The whole film very gradually works towards a final scene which pushed all the right buttons and had me in tears (as those of you who know the film [and me] may well expect). Now, I can understand why some people might think that this film is engineered for the effect of the last scene but, for me, its wonder lies in repeat viewing. This film is about nostalgia. It can be felt reliving Toto's childhood on each viewing. Together with the characters (""the square is mine!""), the familiarity of the Sicilian village, and the evocative music score, the film improves each time I watch it. It's difficult to describe just how involved you become in such an uneventful (plot-wise) film. But it isn't about the plot - it's about the experience. Give it a try and become part of it.",

Life is going too good at the cinema paradiso and the whole cute Alfredo as angry old man and Toto as precocious young boy has become played out, therefore, fire. Next, we see a shallow adolescent who falls in love with someone he doesn't really know. The relationship is not believable as being anything other than a juvenile infatuation and yet this is what later causes him such sorrow when he returns. Nothing is really shown about him being in the army except a comedic montage and the only time the main protagonist seems to get angry is near the end in the car, otherwise, always swooning or happy. The scene in the car is about the only interesting scene in the film yet it is not believable as following from the relationship they had. The film is thus emotionally vacuous, too long, and clichéd. It had some potential but nothing was sufficiently developed for it to be anything except hollow and unnatural.",

Viva La Tornatore! Grande! Later Tornatore directed MALENA, it is also a great movie, but it never reaches the greatness achieved by CINEMA PARADISO. The movie shows the diverse nature of the crowd present at a movie theater, people in all kinds of moods, as Roger Ebert said,""Romances are launched in the darkness of the theater, friendships are sealed, wine is drunk, cigarettes smoked, babies nursed, feet stomped, victories cheered, sissies whistled at...""! The movie sometimes reminds us of Fellini, especially when in the long shots someone suddenly appears in close up. Like Truffuat, Tornatore gives a special place to posters in this movie. 'This film captures the essence of a man's life, gently bringing us from childhood to middle age believably and beautifully.' There is a presence of warmth and humor in the movie, from the fainting lottery winner to the zealous censorious priest, and the madman who goes on saying, ""This square is mine""! It is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes poignant but it's always warm, wonderful, and satisfying. It is one of a kind. Salvatore is present in all of us. And when Alfredo says, ""Living here day by day, you think it's the center of the world. You believe nothing will ever change. Then you leave: a year, two years. When you come back, everything's changed. The thread's broken. What you came to find isn't there. What was yours is gone. You have to go away for a long time... many years... before you can come back and find your people. The land where you were born. But now, no. It's not possible. Right now you're blinder than I am."" --- it applies to all of us on a universal level. And the music? It is brilliant, romantic and never fails to touch the heart, kudos to Ennio Morricone.

That was satisfying for me. I loved this when I first saw it and I enjoyed it even more in the director's cut -- I cried more at the end. Also the mature Salvatore (Jacques Perine?) had a lot more scenes in the longer version. I liked seeing him talking to his mother and trying to reconcile his childhood memories with the man he'd become. Just an overall beautiful love story of films and unrequited youthful love!

378,15 April 2005,sicboi81,8, What Makes European Cineam Great,"Cinema Paradiso is at the crux of everything that I believe makes European cinema superior to American. Cinema Paradiso is the reminiscence of a middle-aged Italian filmmaker, Salvatore who, upon learning of the death of his mentor, a projectionist named Alfredo, remembers his childhood in postwar Sicily and the movie house, the Paradiso, and the ways in which classic cinema is intrinsically tied to his memories and his life. When Salvatore returns to his village for Alfredo's funeral, he sees the old, abandoned Paradiso and watches it be demolished. He then returns to his life in Rome and watches a reel Alfredo left him of all of the classic movie kisses he had edited out of films over the years at the village priest's bequest. The major element that this great film has that is invariably absent from American dramas is subtlety. If Cinema Paradiso had been an American film, Salvatore wouldn't have reminisced much about his childhood; it would have been glossed over in a seven minute short leaving us with no character development. When he returned to his village for Alfredo's funeral, he most likely would not have been the thoughtful, taciturn man that we see, but some sort of vigilante ready to hatch some last minute, hair-brained, against-all-odds scheme to save the old Paradiso. He would have dealt with some stuffy bureaucrats looking to demolish the Paradiso for unclear personal reasons and he would have had to rally the town to save the theatre of his childhood. Also, in an American version, his childhood sweetheart, Elena, would have somehow returned after thirty years and he would have somehow overcome her distrust to win her back in the end. An American director would have inevitably found a way to destroy any pathos in the plot and turn it into a good-time film. However, Giuseppe Tornatore played his cards right. In the version that is known and loved, Salvatore reminisces with some sadness about his lost youth, returns to his village, attends Alfredo's funeral, says nothing as the Paradiso is demolished, and goes back to Rome. Nothing explodes, he doesn't get the girl, there are no heroes, but Salvatore comes to a subtle personal epiphany about his own life. And that is enough. Perhaps this is the way that European cinema depicts life more closely to the way it is and not in the way it should be as in the American cinema. American cinema never lets its viewers get too emotionally close to its protagonists because they are always in situations in which we never realistically find ourselves and are, therefore, always distanced from their actions. We, as humans, gage our lives by our memories and, in that spirit, Tornatore's tale of a man for who film was the defining factor in his life, brilliantly evoke these tender sentiments for us. A great watch.",

I immediately realized that I ain't just a film buff, I am a Filmmaker. Coming to the review part of this movie, the story telling style of Giussepe is so unique and nostalgic that while you see the people sitting inside Theater reacting to on-screen emotions is classic and makes us feel we are part of them inside Nuovo Paradiso Theater. Alfredo is a great teacher and projectionist who lived Films all his life. Toto at the same time has just discovered his love for cinema. The beauty of cinema Paradiso is on one hand there's Alfredo who dreams to become a filmmaker however he couldn't because he's the only projectionist in Town and on the other hand there's Toto who's desperate about Films and wants to become friends with Alfredo to watch & learn films. However A school exam decides whether they gonna be friends or not. Adult 'Toto' recollects his memory and childhood experience in the village.

401,14 March 2013,reddevil_42,9, Paradise,"Cinema Paradiso is one of my favourite movies. It left me working out if Alfredo was right to do what he did. I watched the released version first and even though I could discern some large plots of the movie missing, it had just the right amount of information for you to fill the rest up. With the director's cut, Alfredo's character is portrayed in much more negative light. Either ways, he is vindicated by the final scene of the movie, which is one of the best I have seen. Just as Salvatore began to ponder on the What-ifs, came this montage of the cut out kissing scenes reminding him of his first and biggest love, the Movies. Portrayal of a young Salvatore, madly in love with the movies and Alfredo's company, is both innocent and charming. The teenage Salvatore, who falls in love with a blue eyed girl and attempts to woo her, has also been very well played. While many meanings lie beneath the scene where the Paradiso finally falls, the one that comes across strongest is that echoed by Alfredo. While attachment to loved ones and feeling nostalgic to one's home and past is natural, it takes true love and devotion to pursue one's passions and calling in life and achieve success. While this 'Sacrifice love for true passion' expression might not resonate with some, it is much easier to understand why Alfredo acted in the manner that he did. He knew that Salvatore had great potential and could go on to do great things in life but at the same time, his attachment to things would always peg him back and restrain him from exploring the possibilities that lied far from home. The two scenes when Salavatore cries are the ones when he sees his love on the projector and the montage at the end. He realizes that the sacrifice had to be made for him to be where he was and was grateful for that.",

The second one is the direction and I am including the third one, the writing one here too.

404,2 November 2010,hywelis,10, Magic,"I am going through an interesting project at the moment. After joining a film club I am ordering films that I haven't seen from the 'Top 500' list from Empire. Last night I watched Cinema Paradiso. Well, I loved it. As everyone else here reports, it's a wonderful treasure set in a beautiful, if stifling, little town in Italy. The characters are warm,wonderful and totally believable and I loved it from start to finish. I went to bed last night dreaming about it and woke up with it swimming through my mind. I have a feeling it will occupy a soft spot in my heart for years to come. If you can lay your foreign film prejudices to one side and park your Hollywood frames of reference in a quiet corner, then grab yourself a beer or glass of wine and settle back to watch one of the best films I have seen in years.",
405,9 May 2005,chrysdtl,8, ...what influenced you as a kid?,"This movie made me cry because it managed to arouse powerful feelings and thoughts about life - the things you learn from it, the people that have an impact on you, the experiences that build you as a person and the way you understand to live it. Toto, the boy fascinated with the cinema and the old man Alfredo, that shows him around the cinema's secrets at it's beginnings, make a wonderful example of friendship. They help each other, learn from each other, laugh together and enjoy life at its fullest through that one thing that connected them in the first place - the cinema. Italian movies have a roughness and a freshness that make them real, away from clichés and well designed everything as the American movies thought us it should be. This film reminded me of ""La vita e bella"" with Roberto Begnini, where another boy discovers life (and stays alive) being influenced by a grown up. And if you're looking for more humor and surprising situations, don't miss ""La vita e bella"".",

A lot of ""The Lover"" is a sadist's wet dream, the protagonist's family is abusive and very dislikable and the protagonist is more of a cardboard cut-out rather than a character you can sympathize with. Everyone in ""Cinema Paradiso"" is much more likable in comparison and the plot points are actually emotionally well-conveyed. I personally prefer the director's cut of ""Cinema Paradiso"".",

Without them the film is a soulless affair with no sense of reality or place. It is a tourist trip to a fantasy Sicily of the 1940s and 50s decked out in nostalgic glowing colours and accompanied by nauseatingly sweet and persistent music.

At that time the TV wasn't what it is today, so the cinema was a very important cultural, informative and social place for every town or city. But besides that, my Grandpa loves movies, and when I see Salvatore falling in love with them it makes me think that my gradpa was a ""real life Salvatore"" when he was a kid.
The relation between Salvatore and Alfredo was the other thing I liked the most, that was true friendship. The love for the cinema that both of them had, made that friendship stronger even though the age difference. Also, Alfredo was a fatherly figure for young Salvatore and always wanted the best for him, even if that meant no seeing him never again (Although that was a bit exaggerated, Salvatore could have go to visit once in a while)

It tells several stories. First and foremost portrays the magic of Cinema, which is one of the cheapest entertainers. With advent of television, fall of Cinema. Human story is about a fatherless boy who develops an attachment to a projectionist who becomes his father figure and helps building his character. There is a love story of first love. I find this story is a Morden transformation of a fairy tale with immense presence of reality. The projectionist Alfredo's character is that of a wise man, who does not demand anything of Toto, but continually feels him with signpost. Amazingly he does not demand to see Toto before he dies. I am now keen to see extended version, which may have expansion in love story. If you have not seen this film, I thoroughly recommend it.",

It is a far better and more complete cut than the original release - which restores Jacques Perrin's towering but understated performance from a small walk on part to the major role it always was. It also reinstates a crucially key scene which was deleted from the original and is fundamental to the completion of this much darker version. I cried in this version even more .... The effortless control of crowd scenes both inside and out make it hard to believe a crew is ever present. The young and old Toto are particularly impressive along with the ever reliable Philippe Noiret, and Morricone's score is quite wonderful. There's a big difference between overwrought sentimentality Hollywood style and sentiment which in this case is really pathos.",

The supporting characters are all very charismatic and interesting too. Lots of great visuals and lots of creative transitions.

428,5 May 2007,bracketj,8, Bittersweet Tenderness in Cinema Paradiso,"recognizes the ennobling effect movies can have on viewers, and then proves this maxim by inspiring tenderness in the viewer. Though the story aptly concerns itself with the bitter effects of war on a family, the modernization of small towns, the distortion of culture, and the loss of young love, its lasting impression is the positive effect a loving mentor can have on the life of an individual despite such hardships. Salvatore's adult life does not reflect much outlet for emotional development, so the audience can infer the importance that his childhood, particularly Alfredo, held for him and his maturity. This loving relationship is most poignant for the audience because it occurs between believable individuals. Neither Toto, nor Alfredo, nor their town is reflected as perfect. Rather, they are all shown to have their flaws, their pompousness, humility and crazy characters mixed in with their beauty, compassion and adoration. This film is well balanced and will warm any audience, at any time, with its ageless story of humanity, regret, growth and love.",

I agree completely with those who believe this to be the most romantic love story ever filmed, ever. Let me add one observation. The structure of the Director's cut allows you to complete matters in a way which would have derogated a bit from the absolute excellence of the theme had it actually been pursued. Salvatore's final comment after the parting telephone conversation, the promise rediscovered in the dusty operator's booth note, and the inexpressibly moving montage from Alfredo tell it inescapably.",

It almost makes you feel as if you're a native in a small Italian town, taking part in all its dramas and twists and turns. There is very strong acting by Philippe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio; you might almost believe they were father and son in real life.
In Cinema Paradiso, a young boy named Salvatore, nicknamed Toto, hangs around with an aging projectionist named Alfredo who runs the theater.

It's sweet and sentimental, romantic and a tad cynical (""Life is not like the movies - It is much harder and difficult"")  First love leads to lost love, memories serve as sad reminders of happier times, the ones you love are fading away.  These themes are all played out in a charming montage of sublime scenes, each lovely word of dialogue revealing the pain and loneliness we all feel, the very loneliness which continually draws us to the movies to begin with.

This love not only corresponds with spectators who share a passion for films nowadays but for the Italians in 'Cinema Paradiso' and millions of others globally during WWII.

The movie has a theatrical version and a director's cut. I would suggest watching the theatrical cut, which is actually my favorite, before watching the director's cut. The director's cut answers a lot of unanswered questions in the theatrical cut, but in my opinion it went a little bit too far in explaining certain things. Telling the story in flashbacks of his early youth and later teenage years was a fine way of developing the characters.

This is one of the most beautifully made films I have seen: maybe not my favourite movie ever, but everything simply slots into place: Philippe Noiret is extraordinary as Alfredo, Salvatore Cascio is outstanding as the young Toto. Tornatore has created a masterpiece, and Morricone's music is perfect. You must see this film.",

The princess had promised to marry the soldier if he could prove his love for her by staying for a full 100 days.  The projectionist ends the story by asking the question, ""Why does the soldier finally give up when he is so close to his goal?""

They are there to save each other's life. The other village residents progress over time also, so that one sees them age, mini stories within a story! The village madman, the romantic couple, the censuring priest, Toto's grieving mother all play a role in making Toto a success in life. The ending is a touching tribute to Toto from now deceased Alfredo, a loving gesture of devotion that will make the tears flow. Who hasn't lost someone without a final goodbye?

473,26 August 2014,tessa242008,9," Great movie over all, definitely worth the time :)","Over all this movie is a great watch. Its a movie thats good for all ages and its one of the best foreign movies I've seen yet. The actors that had the privilege to be part of this movie were truly brilliant throughout, and deserve to be credited with at least a 9/10 rating. The man who plays Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) does a brilliant job of portraying his character as the man behind the movies; and when the fire occurs, that whole scene with Alfredo and Salvatore 'Toto' invokes tears into all the viewers eyes. I know I spent a good portion of the rest of that movie with a Kleenex box next to me. I myself am of Italian nationality and it was truly wonderful to see a good Italian movie, with a great story line as well as great actors and comedic relief where it was needed. The nice thing is that if you don't want to watch it with subtitles, you can change the language. Although, I do recommend that you watch it with subtitles as it keeps it more authentic when watching it in Italian. I have personally watched this movie at least 10 times and never seem to get tired of it. All in all a truly great movie, 100% worth your time :)",
474,6 April 2008,kennyfan,10, Beautiful Example of Italian film making,"The title of this comment should correctly convey my feelings for this movie. It is a beautiful example of foreign film making and contains many ideas and themes that many U.S. directors should utilize more often. I love this movie because of the ideas to do with innocence, happiness, love and loss and how they affect ourselves and how hollow people can become if exposed to either too much or not enough of any of these things. a highly commended mention for the score, brilliantly executed and fitting the mood perfectly, the music is the proverbial icing on the cake that gives this movie even more of a soulful atmosphere than it would have had with out it. The story flows seamlessly, and the main characters are genuinely likable, and one almost feels a sense of loss when the movie is over every. every character, no matter how small a part they play in the film, all have their own sense of belonging, embellishing the story line from start to finish. It is the characters, even the smallest one that keep the story moving, from the village idiot to Salvatore himself, and, despite the fact that I don't normally like movies that are generally longer than 1.5 hours, 2 at a pinch, I was able to watch this movie and keep track of the story, and still be able to empathize with the characters. a truly touching moment is when Salvatore discovers what Alfredo's final gift to him is, especially with how the music tied everything together produced a brilliant movie moment.",

480,15 December 2002,bo-selecta,10, Italians do it better.,"Sure there are a plethora of ""coming of age"" flicks out there, but nothing like this. In fact I find it difficult to categorise Cinema Paradiso, as it has so many ingredients which blend almost seamlessly into the narrative arc - drama, humour, pathos, suspense, romance, plus depictions of the ever changing religious, familial, political and social environments in the Sicilain town of Giancaldo. At its core, Paradiso's main theme is obviously the love of cinema.  The film celebrates the medium's ability to bring a group of rather disparate people together for a couple of hours to indulge in a pastime that, for some, is a nice escapist diversion.  However, for Salvatore Di Vita (""Toto""), it becomes his passion.",

What a triumph in film making. I am NOT a deep thinker. I am NOT a foreign movie buff, though I have seen many. I am just an average Jane. To me, that this movie could mean so much to someone who is just ""regular folk"" says a lot about the way in which it was made. I have a really hard time describing this movie to recommend it to people. I pretty much just say, ""Oh, it is magic. Incredible. You will love it."" But then when I try to explain the plot, I realize it is such a simple plot and most people look at me like I am an idiot. As if, ""what could possibly be interesting about that?""

This film is about choosing a life of love or money gives us a beautiful story about this young boy who grows up to become a successful man in the movie industry. The film starts with the protagonist as a wealthy man living in the big city. He immediately gets a telephone call from his mother saying that Alfredo is dead. With that, he relapses into a state of dream to show us his story, a story of his time with Alfredo, the man who works with the movie projector, and a story of his one true love, Elena. The story also has family elements and we can see the way that the relationship between Toto (the main character) and Alfredo grows from beginning to end. The soundtrack is also a heartwarming collection which really adds to the imagery and tone. The tunes in this movie have stuck with me and are stuck right into my mind, but I don't mind because they are artistic pieces which remind me of this delightful and insightful movie.",

No special effects, just a great story, brilliantly conceived, directed and shot, captivating acting by perfectly cast actors and yet another inspired soundtrack from the genius Ennio Morricone. The shorter version delivers as much enjoyment but the full version is more satisfying as it closes the circle. I defy anyone not to be captivated by it!

Its focus is the power of love to shape our lives over the long term. The protagonist's passion for the cinema and his youthful immersion in ""first love"" are intertwined, and become mutual symbols each for the other. What constitutes success and what failure? What is or must be sacrificed to achieve our goals, and how are we to know in advance which life goals will prove worthy and enduring? All these dilemmas move beneath the surface of an engaging tale, but without detracting from its drama. Let me point out too an important word of warning that may be missed: When an adult's help and guidance of a young person, no matter how lovingly offered, crosses the line to making decisions for them without their knowledge or consent, the consequence often may be suffering for which no one would have wished.",

The score is also beautiful and haunting. While I've seen it at least 7 times I still become very emotional...the music alone moves me.,
535,20 August 2013,karl-sokhn,8, Infinitely Innocent,"We all have had moments when we seemed to cling to past sensations or childhood memories, we feel a certain comfort re invoking these thoughts into mind. That is exactly what Cinema Paradiso portrays in an almost 3 hour long movie all through which you don't budge. Allow me to explain : The past is an ambiguous word but to clarify, let's consider the past as the numerous events that lead to NOW, the present. Having said that, the movie is a picture perfect depiction of the influence of the past on one's present and future. Childhood, teenage crisis, first love, the search for one's roots etc.. I shall detail these headlines. This movie represents the main character Salvatore Di Vita,a bright little kid who, never met or had any kind of interaction with his father(a soldier in the Italian army). And Alfredo, an old man with no kids who takes care of film reels in the Cinema Paradiso. (The only downside of the Cinema Paradiso was that films were censored and scenes involving physical contact were cut from the reels). Many actions lead their relationship to strengthen throughout the movie even though their bond had an inherent tendency to grow because each of them found in the other what he was lacking. Alfredo soon becomes the father figure Salvatore longed for as a kid and the little boy starts seeking counsel with the elder in matters that he couldn't understand. He becomes the prominent person that represents Salvatore's childhood along with the Cinema Paradiso, the place where Salvatore cultivated a love for Cinematography. And finally Elena, Salvatore's one true love draws the final stroke on this amazing portrait : Giancaldo, Salvatore's home village. Outer Circumstances force Elena and Salvatore to be separated, and their attempts to communicate fall on deaf ears and they lose all kinds of contact. A while after that Alfredo's counsel leads Salvatore(Toto) to leave the cradle of his childhood in order to pursue his dreams. He returns several years after to attend Alfredo's funeral and starts to rediscover Giancaldo from an other point of view and is finally able to make peace with his past with Alfredo's posthumous help. Finally i would like to add that the movie has an air of innocence to it and an immensely frivolous atmosphere giving all the characters' feelings a sincerity that i have never seen in any other movie.",

538,21 November 2016,jamiek-27013,8," A true story of love, loneliness, passion, and faith.","Cinema Paradiso was a satisfying Italian film that has won numerous awards. I watched it with English subtitles. I was immediately pleased that I could pick up some basic phrases in the beginning, as it opened with a telephone conversation. I was quickly drawn into the plot as the scene flashed from a handsome, distinguished gentleman quietly reflected on his relationship that had spanned many years and experiences and shaped his life, with his dear friend, Alfredo. The young Toto, with all his mischievous, bright- eyed wonder, was impossible not to love. And the hard-talking Italian film operator, Alfredo, had a soft side that was evident through his way of protecting the young boy. The impact of the cinema on a community was nostalgic. There was a careful balance that seemed to never be disrupted between the growing Toto and his mentor, with the stakes growing higher each new phase of growth. Beautiful was the love story of tentative, curiously exploration as Toto came of age, easy to relate to, and certainly pulled at the heart strings. We see Toto grow from a boy operator in one city, to far away from where he came from, older, wiser, perhaps a little lonely. By the end of the film, we too are wistfully reminiscent of the old days of Cinema Paradiso and sweet, innocent love. One thing is for certain by the end of this film: There is no certainty except life moves forward and all good things come to an end. – Jamie K.",
