0,30 December 2013,SnoopyStyle,9, Real tear jerker opening,Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) as a young quiet kid idolized explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) and his discovery of Paradise Falls. Ellie is much more animated and also a great fan of Muntz. Together they would marry and live their lives together until the day she dies. Now Carl is hounded by a property developer and forced to go to a retirement home. Instead he ties a sea of helium balloons to his home and float away to Paradise Falls. Wilderness Explorer scout Russell who's trying to get an Assisting the Elderly badge gets dragged along on the adventure.,/
1,17 May 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," In my personal opinion, this is Pixar's funniest and most poignant film","I love Pixar and feel they have been pretty consistent. True I do prefer Toy Story over Cars and Finding Nemo over Ratatouille, but I find their films amazingly animated and thrilling. I thought that after the first two Toy Story films, that Pixar wouldn't be able to make a film to top them. WALL-E, yes I loved it, came pretty close, but in my opinion Up is Pixar's masterwork. And why do I say that? Because it is widely imaginative and astonishing in its emotional range.",r
2,29 May 2009,DonFishies,10," Imaginative, fun and moving - as close to perfect as Pixar has ever been","Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) has lived a long life, but dreams of adventuring to South America. He wants to spend his remaining days in his home, but new high-rises are being constructed around it. After a chance accident, Carl loses his home, and is set to be taken into a retirement home. Unhappy with this idea, the former balloon salesman ties thousands of balloons to his house and simply floats away, en route to his dream adventure. Except, he is not alone – young ""wilderness explorer"" Russell (Jordan Nagai) inadvertently shows up in mid-air, and Carl sees no other choice but to bring the boy with him.",e

5,22 November 2009,ccthemovieman-1,9, Another Feast For The Eyes,"This is another film in which it really helps to know in advance what it is, or more specifically, what it isn't. Then, you go from there. I enjoyed the animated film very much but, some of that was due to the fact a friend clued me in first, saying ""this isn't really a comedy or a film for little kids. Don't expect a ton of laughs."" So, instead of seeking laughs (although I still got them here and there), I just enjoyed the adventure story and marveled at the amazing artwork. ",e
6,4 June 2009,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," Up ""uped"" the bar once again! Wonderful movie","Seriously, I'm convinced, Pixar is maybe the only movie studio that is providing the best movies around. Who said that animated films can't be considered real movies? Can't be considered an art form? Up is the latest creation from Disney and Pixar, after last year's smash hit WALL-E, I felt like they couldn't at all top themselves and they did it again with this incredibly charming story. Admittingly from the trailer, I wasn't sure this story was going to work as well, but I got the opportunity to see Up this week and was just totally blown away by it's story, animation and characters. The thing I adore about these movies that Disney and Pixar are creating is that they're not just for the kids, but the adults as well, this is something that I could even see an adult seeing by themselves. This story doesn't insult kid's intelligence and is extremely entertaining for anyone to enjoy, to go through this adventure with an old man who just wanted to make his wife happy.",w

9,23 September 2015,ironhorse_iv,8, Lighten Up with UP! It's up there as one of the best animation movies of all-time!,"What's up? Up is up! It was very successful movie! It even was nominated for Best Picture by the Academy Awards. It was the second animation film to do that. Directed by Pete Docter, Up is Pixar's tenth film in their series and their first full-length 3-D film. The film tells the story of an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen (Voiced by Edward Asner) whom trying to fulfill his late wife's dream by taking their house to South America. The only problem is, that an earnest Boy Scout named Russell (Voiced by Jordan Nagai) has tagged along, making the simple trip, so much, more complex. Can Carl make it to South America or will his late wife's dreams be shattered? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found this movie to be very entertaining. The movie is gorgeous and colorful. Sadly, the 3D isn't worth it, but it's still, beautiful to the eyes. I love the amazing music by Michael Giacchino. I just wish, the tune sound more South or Latin American, than European, because it would make more sense. The movie is unsurprisingly well action part. Great pacing. The film is also well-acted. Everybody did their parts, very well. Edward Asner was a great choice as Mr. Fredricksen. I love his grumpiness in his voice. The use of mostly grunts, make it seem, like his responses come from a protective stance, rather than his own grouchy nature. Jordan Nagai as Russell is just as likable. He has the most lines, in the film, and none of it, sounds too annoying. I guess, there was something, sweet about his voice. You really do hear it, whenever, Russell speaks. I love that the actor wasn't even trying to get cast for the role, but end up, getting it, over his brother who was. It show, how charming, his voice is. The supporting cast's voice acting is just as memorable. Christopher Plummer as the villain, Charles Muntz, the explorer was fun to listen to. Bob Peterson as Dug, the dog, was pretty amazing. His voice in this, remind me so much of veteran voice actor, Dom DeLuise. I also love the cameo from Pixar's own favorite actor, John Ratzenberger in his minor role. As much as I love the voice acting; I really love, how the cartoon characters appear in this film. I like how, they have more child-like appealing cartoony look. The whole over the top celebrity caricatured facial appearances kinda works, because the older computer model for humans, used in Toy Story 1&2 are just way too bland-looking and unappeased. It has that creepy uncanny valley look to it. Anyways, I think, the new model gives the movie, the amount of surrealism to make the plot to work. I really doubt, the film could work, with more realistic facial appearances, because how bizarre, the premise is. While, the appearance of Carl is meant to resemble Spencer Tracy as he appeared in his final film, 1967's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. I like his short square status, and cartoony facial expressions. It makes Carl stand out. Unlike some critics, I also love, how Russell look. He doesn't look, like a kid with Down syndrome. He looks like a normal kid. I think, they were a little too harsh in their judgment. I also love the fact, that Russell is clearly Asian American, but his character lack the typical Asian over-stereotyping. Surprising, it makes the character, so much, more appealing, because it's not stepping over to over-used racial clichés. Charles F. Muntz really looks like, an old explorer, but his character's looks was a bit jarring. I really had a hard time, believing, that he's that well maintain, at his age, when he spent, most of the film, living for so long, outside of civilization. In my opinion, he should have, look, a little more broken-down. Last is Dug. He's a very realistic looking golden retriever. I own one, and they got it exactly right. I like how he closes his mouth and freezes when he notices a squirrel. Funny moment right there. For the story, it's both a hit and miss. I love that the film deals with more adult like drama, than childish antics. Having Carl still dealing with the loss of his wife, gave the movie, so much depth. It was really needed. However, besides the awesome and unexpected genuine tearjerker opening marriage montage, the film goes into another direction, with its absurdity. It's really off the wall, crazy and convenient, that Carl able to travel to South America in the way, he's traveling. The movie takes great artistic license, when it comes to engineering and physics. You have to really, be willing to suspension your disbelief from the rest of the entire film. Especially, when Russell was designed to be the child that Carl and his wife were unable to have, in both a figurative and literal spirit. Another thing, I didn't get about the plot, is how Charles Muntz can be, easily discredited. Clearly, the amount of what he found, in his short life, would give, his statements about the exotic bird, some credit. Clearly, much of the unexplainable questions in the plot, could be solve in the Carl is crazy theory that certain people has latch on. In theory, Carl didn't travel to South America, instead the Balloons are metaphors, reflecting Carl's happy and uplifting memories of his wife. Hints, why he was stubbornly clinging to them and refuses to let go, as if he's afraid he's going to fall. It wasn't until he did, was he able to live life, once more. Other people have notice, some themes similarity in the plot to John Milton's great poems Paradise Lost, Harvey Potter's Balloon Farm by Jerdine Nolen, and most of all, several really obvious references to Studio Ghibli. Overall: It deserve its good praise. A must-watch. Things can only go up from here.",w

14,29 May 2009,Apemangalore,9, One of the finest films I've ever seen,"If Pixar - as a studio - has any weakness, it's that they have no idea how to make a bad film. Again and again they release entertaining movies with not only a terrific sense of humor, but a level of storytelling that has set a standard for today's films, animated or otherwise. While I was obviously extremely excited to see Up, never did I expect it - or, to be honest, anything else from this year - to reach the level of quality of this year's first animated film, Coraline (which, along with last year's Bolt and Wall-E, became one of my favorite films of all time). Well, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Simply put, Up is a perfect movie.",1
15,18 January 2021,auuwws,9, Up,"One of the best Pixar movies, the beginning of the movie makes anyone cry even if they turn them from your stone, and do not cry from any movie. The beginning of the movie and the movie stars were excellent. I'm really sympathetic to Carl. Rarely is a cartoon character well written in a target for children. The story of the movie was excellent, the message of the movie was, and I feel that the movie made me feel the magic of the Disney films that I missed a lot, the evil of the film was disappointing and was not convincing unlike the rest of the bad guys at Pixar and Disney, my rating for the movie is 9.2",5

20,26 May 2009,C-Younkin,8, Pixar soars again,"""Up"" is a winner, and I couldn't be less surprised. Anyone still putting a limit on how new and inventive they think a Pixar film can be deserves to have their socks blown off. For the rest of us, just buy a ticket and expect to be taken away. This new flick is the work of writers/directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson, two guys who have each been around the making of Pixar flicks before. Docter was a director on ""Monsters Inc"", a writer on ""Toy Story"" and a co-writer and director on ""Wall*E."" Peterson was a writer on ""Finding Nemo"". Both know the guidelines for success and while ""Up"" doesn't reach the heights of say a ""Wall*E"" or a ""Toy Story"", it's still a fantastic movie because, well, I don't think the people Pixar hires know how to make anything other than fantastic movies.",e

When he meets the girl Ellie, who also worships Munts, they become close friends. However Charles Munts falls in disgrace, accused of forging the skeleton of the monster of Paradise Falls, and he travels in his blimp to South America to bring the monster alive and he is never seen again. Carl and Ellie get married and they promise to each other to travel together to Paradise Falls and build a house there. Many years later, Ellie dies and the lonely Carl refuses to move from their house despite the offers of the owner of a construction company. When Carls hits one worker that damaged his box-mail, he is sentenced to move to a retirement home. However, he uses many balloons to float his house and travel to Paradise Falls. While floating, he finds that the boy Russell, who is in the Wilderness Explorer Training trying to get his assisting the elderly badge to be promoted to senior, is a stowaway on board. They travel together to South America where Russell finds a weird bird that he names Kevin and the talking dog Doug. Then they meet the insane villain Charles Munts that spent his life in the forest trying to catch Kevin with his talking dogs. But Carl and Russell decide to protect Kevin and they have the adventure of their lives. ",f
22,30 May 2009,Craig_McPherson,10," Up-lifting, Up-standing, Up-pealing, and quite simply - brilliant!","Sadly, there aren't enough superlatives in the English language with which to laud Up, the latest offering from the folks at Disney/Pixar. This is quite simply the best movie of any genre to emerge thus far this year. No small praise considering how I've long been adverse to ""kids movies"", pegging them as being shallow, vapid, and simplistic - a personal preconception which Pixar mercifully shattered with 2004's The Incredibles and 2008's WALL-E, which proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that for all their acclaim as an animation studio, they are equally brilliant story tellers Up tells the story of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner), who as a child meets Ellie, later to become the love of his life. Carl and Ellie find they share a common dream – to one day visit Paradise Falls, a mysterious tropical oasis in South America made famous in vintage newsreels chronicling the exploits of explorer/adventurer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). Life, however, manages to get in the way as the two grow up, get married, experience the pain of miscarriage, and eventually grow old, so much so that father time catches up on Ellie, leaving Carl a widower. All of this is conveyed with little dialog in a masterful sequence that had the audience, old and young alike, sniffling throughout.",_
23,6 April 2010,colinrgeorge,7," ""Up""","""Up"" may be more emotionally charged than previous Pixar efforts, though almost exclusively in its first act, and is nevertheless a step down in storytelling for the company that last year brought us ""Wall-E"" and before that ""Ratatouille.""

24,31 May 2009,Quinoa1984,10," as they say, Pixar hits it out of the park again!","Some, and you know who you are if you're reading this, may come across the IMDb page for Pixar's Up (and no, it's not Up! with an exclamation point, as that belongs to the 1976 Russ Meyer X-rated flick), and turn your nose up at it as just another Disney and/or Pixar kids flick. ""An old man with balloons tied to his house flying around with an annoying kid, not enough ""art"" for my taste"" (or something similar to that if not as snobbish). I want to relay an example for you that may get you excited: this is for Pixar a riff on Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo. You might remember that crazy little movie where Klaus Kinski, a dreamer obsessed with opera, decides he has to build an opera house in the middle of the South American jungle, so in order to accomplish this he has to drag his big freighter-ship across a mountain to the other side. It is a leap of faith, but we take it because it's led by a filmmaker with a compelling sense of telling a story with an equally compelling protagonist. Balloons tied to a house, ship across a mountain, not much difference if you ask me, just the degree of the ambition.",t
25,27 July 2009,Buddy-51,7, loses its way at times but endearing in large part,"For a few perilous moments in the middle of ""Up,"" I began to suspect that the folks at Pixar just might be about to register their first major stumble in the studio's hitherto flawless reign as ""king"" of the computer-animated film (a reign which began with ""Toy Story"" all the way back in 1995). But, like the airborne house that floats at the center of the story, the movie eventually righted itself and sailed off smoothly into the wild blue yonder.",t
26,22 August 2010,moonspinner55,7," Sweet sentimentality and raucous kiddie comedy...not always a sublime mixture, but the intentions are true","The opening eleven minutes of Disney/Pixar's animated ""Up"" are pure poetry in motion. Chronicling a man's journey in life from boyhood to married adult to lonely widower, director Pete Docter gives us images which are extraordinarily heartfelt, so elegiac in tone they should take an audience's collective breath away. Big dreamers but relative homebodies, an elderly man and his wife live happily together alone in their house until her passing. Faced with eviction, the man gets an amazing idea overnight: attach thousands of helium-filled balloons to his rickety old house and sail it through the air to a revered point in South America. But, as with 2008's ""WALL·E"", there has to be dramatic conflict, a villain, a chase, and lots of outrageous comedy in order to attract the youthful target audience. In a perfect world, there would be a Pixar effort designed to steadfastly avoid this kind of commercial pandering to 10-year-olds. Once the house reaches the next continent, the man, now joined by a chatty juvenile, encounters a rare bird being hunted by a world-renown explorer--the 78-year-old's childhood hero--who fails to live up to his newsreel notoriety. The bird only wants to get back to her babies in their nest (how's that for conflict?), while the man and his kid-companion are held off by a pack of dogs who have voice-boxes in their collars. If this isn't bad enough, at one point the dogs even prove to be flying aces in fighter planes apparently held in storage since WWI (it's a lackluster homage to ""King Kong"", and a highly unnecessary one). The screenplay, written by Pete Docter and his assistant Bob Peterson from a treatment by Docter, Peterson and Thomas McCarthy, is so wonderfully cognizant of an elderly person's traits and attachments to their beloved belongings, to then witness the central character being chased by talking dogs is an insult. And yet, because the filmmakers are wise enough to keep returning to the tale's likable principles, ""Up"" is often vastly entertaining. The detail is marvelous, often beautiful, as is the subtle music score by Michael Giacchino. There are a handful of near-terrible moments in the film which keep it from being a true masterpiece, but Docter and his team are surprisingly honest when it comes to the sentiment. The friendships made and lost in ""Up"" are genuinely touching; and, though the slapstick is noisy and sometimes mean-spirited, the overall intent to somehow steer this vessel to a happily-ever-after ending is clearly evident and commendable. *** from ****",_

But in the case of their latest 3-D animated story, ""Up"", I'm sad to report that this new Pixar concoction does not live up to the all the hype. For those who are watching a Pixar animated film for the first time, of course 'Up' will seem quite impressive.

35,7 September 2009,solacewaves,7, The greatest journeys UP are when you're most down,"In terms of animated features, Pixar ventures where very few other animated films have gone before and that is to delve into the lives of the elderly generation. In fact, having any film (animated or not) examine what it is like to grow old and the roller coaster ride that is life would normally mean you are in for some heavy material indeed. This is because true depictions of life are not constantly joyful and grand, it is always hand in hand with tears and hardships. In this respect, Pixar are to be applauded to have dared create a ""kids"" film that explores the circle of life in all its vivid glory and personal heartache.",

He meets a lively adventurous little boy, and has a fantastic, exciting, and yes perilous adventure in the place of his childhood dreams. This adventure is in the loving memory of his wife, and although he starts out thinking the little boy is an annoyance, they become almost family by the end of the story. This is not a sad story.

The first 15 minutes of this movie is a masterpiece in storytelling. Nobody can tell me otherwise. I think literally every single time my mom has watched it she has cried. I don't cry during movies, but there are a couple things that definitely get me close... and the first 15 mins is one of them. The rest of the movie is a super fun adventure and is one of the funniest Pixar films to date. The kid, the bird, the dogs, all great. The message the film implies is also very important and sadly true for all. Watched this so much as a kid, and can't wait to show it to my kids.

More than most seemed to feature some sarcastic little animal,voiced by an irritating overpaid recognisable actor picking up and easy paycheck. So, with trepidation i inserted Up in to my DVD machine and after 10minutes i realised i was watching something as imaginative as it was visually impressive. I never gave a second thought to who was voicing who.To my delight, i just let myself be carried away with the film and at the end i found myself having choked back the tears at least 5 times. Wow. I never thought a digimation could do that to me but it did. My hardened heart has been thawed by the sheer joy and creation on display in Pixars Up.

42,15 February 2020,Ryan_Barbakins,10, Adventure is right here!,"This is my personal favorite pixar film. The music, dialogue, characters, comedy, and story have ingrained themselves into my brain forever as something to behold. This film succeeds every time to hit the right emotional buttons for me. This I believe is because of how greatly developed each element is.
A criticism I see thrown around is that the first 10 minutes are great, while the rest isn't. I strongly disagree, because this film isn't only about the first 10 minutes. It is about an old man getting the adventure of his lifetime, hoping to do it for his deceased wife, but eventually letting himself move on from it. The very end of the film when Carl lets his house float away saying ""it's just an old house"" perfectly encompasses this theme.

46,24 March 2010,JoeytheBrit,8, Squirrel!,"Films like Up, with computer-generated animation that captures every tiny human gesture and expression while still presenting a parody of the face and body, are so far removed from traditional animation that they might as well be given a genre of their own. That's not intended to denigrate the work of the likes of Pixar, but simply to point out that what we have here isn't so much another form of animation as another form of non-human images. Where Up! loses the kind of warmth human animators were capable of drawing into their characters, it redeems itself by delivering an emotionally-anchored tale of adventure that relies heavily on it's lead character's melancholy state of mind to keep the audience on board. To this end, Up! is more of an adult's film with elements added to keep the kids entertained rather than the other way around, which is usually the case with films like this.",
47,15 June 2015,anaconda-40658,8, Way Up!,"Up (2009): Dir: Pete Docter / Voices: Edward Asner, Jordan Nagai, Bob Petersen, Christopher Plummer, Pete Docter: Adventurous animation regarding living life to the fullest. Elderly Carl Fredricksen descends to the air bound for South American Paradise Falls via thousands of balloons lifting his house. He is accompanied by an eight year old kid out for adventure. While third act is ridiculous with dogs flying planes, director Pete Docter is backed with extraordinary visual images. He previously made another inventive Pixar animation called Monsters Inc. Edward Asner voices Carl whose back story is the emotional core. It is a sad yet detailed account of how his childhood love gradually became his wife but their planned trip to Paradise Falls was always prevented. He will now make the trip with Russell and become the father figure he never was. Jordan Nagai voices the enthusiastic Russell whose meaning is obvious. Bob Petersen voices Dug the dog with a voice collar and a better route in life in mind. Christopher Plummer voices the villain whose story is depressing considering his humiliation. His ability to render dogs in flight with speech collars is insane, and his defeat is at the mercy of his accusers. Pete Docter provides the noises of the rare bird in edition to directing this epic animation. The film teaches our potential regardless of our age. Score: 8 / 10",

50,27 January 2013,paul2001sw-1,9, A real movie,"'Up', the latest delightful animated film from Pixar, combines whimsicality, beautiful graphics and a lot of laughs. It follows in the spirit of previous Pixar movies, most obviously its immediate predecessor 'WALL-E', but has something of its own flavour too - although the medium is different, there are elements of this film that would not have been out of place in Nick Park's 'Wallace and Grommit' films. What really has impressed many people about Pixar's films, and which certainly impressed me about this one, is not just that they feature groundbreaking animation, but they are put together with a real auteur's eye: look for the quality of the scene composition, or the way that the final images of one scene fit visually and thematically with the starting images of the next, and it's clear that this is a film made by people who know how to make movies (although for once, John Lasseter himself is not directing, and the job is done instead by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson). And ask yourself, have many mainstream Hollywood blockbusters feature two (sympathetic) characters as unglamourous as a childless widower and a fat kid? This is a gentle movie, for sure; but also a genuinely funny one, and oddly, in spite of its fantastical story, a certain grounding in truth actually lacking in most live action Hollywood films.",

These both lines are outrageously wrong. Up is nowhere near funny, it is actually quite depressing. They simply showed the funny scenes in the trailer but the actual movie was not funny. Right from the beginning, we see the old man as a kid being forced by his future wife (as a kid) to like him, and eventually it starts from there. They eventually get married, live a happily nice life then a few short scenes of pictures with background music, they show the wife dying in a hospital then there, she is dead. That's not funny.",

The movie ""teaches"" us that we can still realize our life-long deferred dream of exploring South American wilderness if we can just attach thousands of helium balloons to our house and sail away. It's hard to say if up to then Frederickson's life has been fulfillment or disappointment.

Not least effective is a lovely montage sequence that takes our hero from childhood through dating, marriage and loss of his much-loved wife.

Don't get me wrong, its a good movie, but its one of those movies where if you can work out the perfect way the story should go- thats what you'll see. The opening montage of the life of Ed Asner's character with his wife is as damn near a perfect arc of a life as you'll likely to see...and the tears come exactly on cue. through much of the film when you see certain visual images or verbal references, you realize that you'll see them later on. Its a perfectly constructed film, possibly the most perfectly constructed film that Pixar's made, but at the same time it's the most artificial. Pete Docter has fashioned the most perfect of animated, nay, of any films from all of the best stuff in the world and he forgot one key thing, heart and emotion, real heart and deep emotion. Yes I was moved and yes I was carried along, but at the same time I didn't feel completely part of it. I didn't really feel the real emotion. I didn't feel the emotional connection of Wall-e and Eva, I didn't feel the joy of Peter O'Toole's food critic at the end of Ratatouille. the ""Claw is our Master"" in Toy Story is still better then ""look a squirrel"". I know I've complained about almost every Pixar feature, but even in the bitching there was real emotion and not manipulated emotion.",

Come on, it will lift your spirits up! OK, enough uppers already! Do not want it to be a downer for you guys. ""Up"" is yet another creative Pixar tale about a lonely geriatric widower named Carl Frederickson who fixates on fulfilling his deceased wife Ellie's wishes of flying their house to a paradisiacal land in South America. This idea might not fly with many, but grumpy Carl just wants to be happy by his lonesome in his own isolated South America Paradiso. However, Carl did not expect a junior wilderness explorer to come along for the ride. What's up with that? Russell is the aforementioned boy scout who accidentally gets stuck in the house during Carl's upward liftoff. Nevertheless, Frederickson was in no mood to be ""bringing down the house"" even with Russell on board. Frederickson and Russell end up landing in the paradise land (house and all), and there they befriend a talking dog named Dug and an eccentric female bird who Russell names Kevin. Their nemesis comes in the form of the devious explorer Charles Muntz who masters a pack of menacing talking dogs. So therefore, Frederickson and Russell are confronted with plenty of ""ups"" and ""downs"" during their adventurous experience. There are many humanistic elements in ""Up"" such as aging, loneliness, acceptance, and detachment that many kids might not be up for; but provides invaluable life lessons on character education to our future generation. ""Up"" does play with your heartstrings plenty, so bring a hanky! The former Mr. Grant, Ed Asner, was granted a perfect role to voice as Frederickson; that impressed me Ed Asner! (Only ""Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" fans got that pun upper). Bob Peterson's tender & uplifting screenplay was superb while Pete Docter doctored a successful directorial uperation of ""Up"".

I loved WALL*E as much as you fellow reader but I don't consider it the very best Pixar film, it is not even one of my 5 favourite Pixar films, hell I haven't felt desires to buy/rent its DVD, I haven't felt desires to watch it for the second time. I just saw Pixar's latest production (in 3-D and it looks, as expected, just wonderful!) Up (Peter Docter directed it being his second Pixar film. His other, the 2001 Monsters Inc., is my second favourite from Pixar) and for me is just as wonderful as WALL*E and Ratatouille (another film I haven't seen since I saw it for the very first time on the big screen back in 2007) but like those two films it is not one of my most favourites from Pixar.",

It's not as tightly plotted as other Pixar flicks, and the villain, in particular, could have used more work. But so what? Really, I haven't enjoyed a movie this much since, well, Wall-E. The prologue of this film, especially its second sequence, a completely silent (except for score) exploration of a long, beautiful marriage that gives us a novel's worth of information in a mere 8 minutes, is so remarkable that I could not hold back tears. In a way, that's a minor flaw as well. The film never quite tops those first 10 or 15 minutes. But the remaining 70 or 80 minutes are a ton of fun, and touching in their own way. Pixar shows Disney that cute animal sidekicks can be completely charming and hilarious. Dug the dog who talks with his special collar is constantly hilarious, as is the goofy bird, nicknamed Kevin. Like I said already, the villain is weak and could have been more thoroughly characterized. But it's not too bad - that's made up for with his more villainous talking dogs. Villainous they certainly are, but the way they talk, still thinking like dogs, is always worth some big laughs. And there's also a cute kid who is in no way annoying. Pixar proves once again that it has more imagination, wit and charm than anyone else working in the medium today. And that medium is not animated features, but cinema itself.",

I was a bit skeptical about ""Up"" not because of the recent news that Disney is worrying about its commercial appeal, not because of the unrealistic plot elements (and there are some), but because after nine great movies, a misfire could be on the horizon.

When listening to how they developed the story for UP from the director's commentary on the DVD, I felt as if I as an audience member was being treated with respect and even being nurtured and cared for.

The music was standard Pixar/Disney fare, which has a hint of obvious, on-the-nose emotional-clichés about it by this point in Disney films. Even though the scenes were absolutely ridiculous in logic, it makes for the best kind of kid's film. This is the updated version of ""Rescuers Down Under"" and ""Flight of the Navigator."" (Basically Disney and Pixar decide over the question ""Does the shot look dramatic enough?"" and goes with whichever logic gets them that shot) Personally, I would have liked the movie better if Carl made the decision to stand his ground in the end and not to go after these accessory characters, and the way they arrive and return to the destinations of home and Paradise Falls is completely by happen-stance. In the end, I gave the movie a reluctant 7 stars, though, because it is fascinating what Pixar can dream up, however implausible the story is.",

They must be cheating or somet---Squirrel!,"However they do it, whether it is by steroids, stem cell, Egyptian secrets, Babylonian water, or selling their soul to some monster, Pixar has been providing hit after hit, success story after success story since 1995. Surely they don't profit as much as their rival Dreamworks, but Pixar's films have lasting appeal that can and will span decades and generations to come. I severely doubt a century from now we'll remember Shrek or Madagascar the same way. Pixar's strategy has always been top provide tugs at the heartstrings for every time they deliver a laugh. This mix of comedy and drama has served them well in the past, with Finding Nemo and the Toy Story films being the absolute best examples. Up on the other hand, has overwhelmingly more drama and sad moments than laughs. If you can survive this little shift of film-making from Pixar, then you are in for a treat. Up is yet another grand film from the company that seems to do no wrong and it has great appeal for moviegoers of all-ages.",

Gosh, what originality and what a plodding plot, characters, and empty subsidiary characters!! Yes, you just sit there while old Walt works the sentimentality line he did in the forties and fifties, only with modern animation, eg fat Americans who eat chocolate! Sorry I could not enjoy it more, but you suckered me into the cinema (only £3 each admittedly) and gave me a tired rerun of a lot of other Disney rubbish with superficial modernisms.

133,31 May 2009,pilotom,3, Not UP to par with other Pixar classics,"I own every Pixar film on DVD but I have to say that UP may be the first one I pass on. I was very excited about seeing the film today after reading several good reviews. I think now that perhaps some reviewers out there are letting the Pixar reputation get to them. I can't believe ANYONE would say this is one of the best films of the year. Films like MONSTERS, INC, FINDING NEMO, WALL-E and TOY STORY deserved accolades like that but UP doesn't have the heart those classics did. The film is at its best early on when the characters aren't talking much. We see a montage of the lead character's life as a young Carl meets an exuberant girl named Ellie. We see them marry, live a life together, experience the highs and lows of life and finally, we see Carl loose his beloved Ellie and become a widower living alone in the house that always was their home. This sequence is moving and made me think that Pixar was about to strike another home run. However, at this point the characters start talking more and the story starts to get a bit...much. Carl decides to tie a bunch of helium balloons to his house in order to fly the house off to South America on the adventure he and Ellie were never able to complete together. He unwillingly takes along a young boy scout stand-in (Russell) who ends up on Carl's porch when the house takes off. Russell is determined to earn the patch for helping the elderly required by his troop in order to graduate to senior status. The balloon premise is a bit far-fetched but since it's an animated film, you go with it. However, once in South America, things get progressively weirder. Carl and Russell end up walking through the jungle and mountains with the house strapped to them, floating above. I think I knew the film was NOT going to be the usual classic I was used to from Pixar when they come across a bunch of talking dogs. It seems Pixar, whose done films about animals who can talk and done films just about humans, wanted to mix the two so they write into the story these dogs with collars that allow us to hear their thoughts. The dogs belong to an old adventurer living in the area who is determined to capture a big, ostrich-like bird to prove he's not the fake the world judge him to be decades ago when he claimed the bird existed. The adventurer has hundreds of dogs and not only do they search the jungles for the elusive bird, they also cook for their master, serve meals AND fly planes. Very weird. I think if you're going to make a film about smart, talking animals - make a film about smart talking animals (FINDING NEMO) and if you're going to do a film about humans, do one like THE INCREDIBLES about humans. In UP Pixar tries to mix the two and it just doesn't work. The ONE character who I thought had the most heart and was most interesting, was Kevin, the big bird who doesn't talk, seems devoted to her young and takes an instant liking to the human boy who probably reminds her of her babies. I heard kids in the audience more than once asking what was going on because they couldn't quite understand the story. I suspect UP will not be one of those films kids will watch over and over again like they do with the other Pixar classics. Pixar has some incredibly talented people but in UP I think they spent too much time on ""cool"" ideas and not as much time on developing the story and characters into something we could care about and believe in.",

The relationship was between Carl, a shy young boy who idolizes the explorer Charles F. Muntz, and Ellie, an eclectic young girl who turns an old, rundown home into a headquarters for her club. The two meet out of nowhere one day, spark an immediate, offbeat friendship predicated on their love for exploring new places, get married, and endure decades of happiness before nature takes its course and Ellie passes away.

Along for the ride is stowaway Russell (Nagai in an affective vocal turn for a youth), a 9-year old Wilderness Scout wanting to assist the elderly for his final badge of honor, much to Carl's chagrin. Written and directed with flair, style, humor and most importantlyheart, by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson (who provides hysterical voice work as Dug, a 'speaking' dog the duo encounter, who steals the movie), the film transcends all ages and truly inspires magical moments that will have you feeling like a kid again while crying through your laughter (the early montage of Carl and his wife-to-be Ellie is for the film vault that ranks up there with any Chaplin flick; silence is golden).

I've watched almost every Pixar movie and it seems that despite the potentially least interesting, least commercial subject (an old guy flying away in his balloon-covered house), they just can't go wrong. It's another great film, exquisitely animated and downright beautiful to behold. What makes Pixar films, and ""Up"" in particular, so special? My theory is that beyond the amazing 3d computer graphics, it boils down to likable characterizations and heartwarming humanistic moralistic stories that don't consider their audiences stupid with a dash of good humor and a pinch of wonder added for good measure. Basically, Pixar films like ""Up"" usually have ""heart"" without feeling forced or fake. The life story of the old guy presented at the start was a wondrous touching piece of work accompanied only by beautiful evocative music. Actually the music in ""Up"" is noteworthy for its emotional effectiveness throughout. The story might appear a bit simple in hindsight but it works beautifully and touches on several universal themes and values such as grief, friendship and acceptance. It has its sad dramatic moments but overall it's quite fun, funny and dare I say uplifting. This coming from a guy who's usually allergic to ""feel good"" movies.

This movie really grabbed me by surprise, I didn't expect it to be so good, especially after watching the trailers. I thought Carl was simply an animated version of Clint Eastwoods character in Gran Torino. But in this film we really feel for the characters, the character development in this film is just brilliant. There is a scene at the beginning of the movie where there is no dialogue but we all understand what is going on and it is one of the most heartwarming scenes. The film also has several funny moments so there is a nice balance. This is probably Pixars most serious film, but at the same time it is extremely funny. You think Carl is finally fulfilling his lifelong dream when he sets on a journey to South America, but at the end you realize he has already lived the adventure of his life. Sometimes we are so caught up with reaching our dreams that we miss the adventure of the moment. Enjoy the ride even though at first you had different goals and dreams! A powerful and touching story which at the same time combines some very funny moments (I loved how they played with the voice of the Doberman). This is one of those rare films that is much better than the trailer makes you expect it to be. I know it is a little early in the year but I expect this film to be nominated for best picture. Yes, it is that good.",

This seemed impossible to me, that an audience of people could become so emotionally involved in a film within ten minutes as to start crying...I was wrong. The opening to this film is heartbreaking, and possibly one of the saddest scenes to be featured in a film. And they pepper these little scenes throughout.

There is physical assault, the endangerment of a child, savage dogs, fire, more physical assault and death (again). There is nothing uplifting or redeeming about UP and most of the young children in the theatre had to be carried out crying, because sections of it are dark, menacing and terrifying. The parents I was with agreed that this had to be the product of a disturbed mind and castigated Disney for ever releasing such violent dark content.

Although the 3-D provides added depth, the effect was very subtle. I was hoping for something that popped out of the screen more. I see no need for understatement in a 3-D cartoon, especially one that leans so heavily on the fantastic and implausible. In short, I'm confused by all the praise this movie has gotten, and I think the 3-D version is a waste of time and money.

The same can be said for ""Up"", the tale of an old widower curmudgeon who inadvertently hijacks a stowaway on his sky-bound home as it lifts off for a lifelong destination called Paradise Falls. The film is colorfully rendered, and if you're a guy who once might have been involved in Scouting at any level, you'll get a kick out of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner) sending his young hitchhiker Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) on a hopeless snipe hunt. When these things occur, I find myself in the underdog's corner, and when Russell finds a snipe and names him Kevin, the adventure really gets under way. It's too bad Carl's childhood hero turned out to be a villain, but that sets up the challenge of saving his new found friends from a diabolical, mad scientist, and find a way to get back home. Oh yeah, can't forget the cute canine pal along for the ride as well. His name is Dug, and is sort of the comedy relief character along with Kevin, and has a big hand (paw?) in making the save for the intrepid travelers. For it's efforts, ""Up"" won a Best Animated Feature Film at the Oscars in 2010 against some worthy contenders.

After Wall-E, the bar was set higher than ever. Wall-E was a beautiful haunting picture, made not for children but more for people willing to absorb the imagery without needing to be guided by dialogue. Despite the success of Wall-E, I think Pixar realized how it may have alienated children to some extent with its long first act, and has included more colour and dialogue in their next picture, Up.

Ellie was an extroverted adventurer while Karl was a shy, reserved person but their friendship and marriage lasted a lifetime. It was Ellie's dream to follow in the footsteps of a famous world traveler, Charles (Christopher Plummer) and make her way, someday, to Paradise Falls in Venezuela. Over the years, however, Karl and Ellie, a childless couple had many home and life realities to deal with and they never made it to South America. Now, Ellie has died and Karl is forlorn. Not only that, developers want their Victorian house, the last holdout in an urban neighborhood, to be razed to make way for high rise buildings. They almost get their wish. But, at the last moment, Karl attaches a fleet of balloons to his house, lifting it in the air, and steers a course for Paradise Falls. But, wait, there's more. A talkative, tweenage scout, Russell (Jordan Nagai), who had convinced Karl to help the young lad earn a merit badge for helping the elderly, has stowed away under the house's porch and is, thus, a fellow passenger in Karl's house-airship. At first, Karl is annoyed but after they land in Venezuela, not on target, Russell helps Karl begin to move the household toward the falls. The two also encounter a trained army of dogs, who obey the commands of their long-lost-to-the-world master, Charles the explorer, who has been trying to capture an elusive, large, colorful bird, new to the known world. It seems Karl and Russell are definitely putting a spanner into his plans. What will be the outcome? This is an extremely wonderful family film, highly entertaining and very, very touching. The story is ingenious, with a flowing action that will keep everyone riveted and the animation is amazing, especially in 3-D. But, added to that mix, is a beautifully moving tale of true love, friendship, and loyalty. This viewer was in tears several times and would dare to say most others will do the same. As the voice of Karl, Asner is excellent, his gruffness hiding a caring soul. Nagai is also topnotch, very funny and very sweet as the young, lonely boy. Plummer, too, does a fine job as the ""heavy"" of the movie and the lesser characters are absolutely perfect, too.

191,22 October 2009,jboothmillard,10, Up,"This was the tenth feature created by Walt Disney Pictures studios and Pixar sounded like it had simple concept, but it is done so beautifully that you can feel yourself in the story. Basically, young Carl Fredricksen (Jeremy Leary) loved the idea of exploring, and his hero was the great Charles Muntz (The Sound of Music's Christopher Plummer), and he one day meets fellow exploring enthusiast Ellie (Elie Docter). They grow and marry each other, and over the years they try to achieve their dream of travelling to the Lost Land in South America, but many things stop them, and the dream disappears completely after the sad death of Ellie. Carl (Edward Asner, voice in hundreds of cartoons) is now lonely and grumpy, but still remembers the promise he made to his wife, it is only when he hits a construction worker forcing him to move out to a retirement home that this may actually happen. Before the men can take Carl with them, a huge cover unveils thousands of helium balloons that manage to lift the whole house away, with directional wings to take Carl to South America. He is inadvertently accompanied by a young stowaway, eight-year-old scout Russell (Jordan Nagai) trying to earn his last assisting the elderly badge. After encountering a storm and nearly getting lost they manage to land safely on a cliff of South America's Lost Land, and tying the house to themselves they start walking to find the spot above the large waterfall. On the way they are joined by a rare colourful flightless bird, probably the ""snipe"", that Russell names Kevin, and a talking (with a translator) dog named Dug (Bob Peterson). While walking Carl meets his childhood hero, Charles Muntz, missing for many years trying to find the rare bird that he has to become evil over to catch. There is the point where Carl wants to be alone, determined to fulfil his promise to Ellie, but he finds the adventure book is more full than he originally thought. So he plucks up the courage to go after Russell, the bird and Dug and stop the nasty Muntz from succeeding, in the end he even manages to let his house go, attend Rusell's badge receiving reception, and get a new and I guess better house. Also starring Delroy Lindo as Beta, Jerome Ranft as Gamma and Pixar regular John Ratzenberger as Construction Foreman Tom. The montage near the beginning of Carl and Ellie together with music by Michael Giacchino is beautiful, the film is full of extravagant colour, and all the characters make this a wonderful heart-warming story that makes you believe your never to old to follow your heart and your dreams (sounds corny I know, but it's true). It may be aimed a little more at adults, but with plenty of stuff for the younger generation too, it is a visually astonishing, funny, moving, and imaginative, essential animated viewing. It won the Oscars for Best Music, Original Score for Michael Giacchino, and Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Sound Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Film, and Best Music, and it was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film for Best Original Score.

I've been wanting to see Up for a very long time and finally my little (well actually, incredibly tall) blonde friend decided to buy it for me this Christmas in Blu-ray no less (he spares no expense!) and what do I find, after I had expectations as high as Carl's floating house? I find probably the best Pixar film ever! It's probably even the best animated film I've ever seen too. Up ticks every single box and more. It has a genius original plot, sensational characters, a huge heart, is absolutely hilarious and is also incredibly entertaining whilst balancing all of these things.",
198,1 January 2023,c_navarrete,9, A great opening with a good adventure,I would be lying if I said that the best scene in up wasn't the beginning but nevertheless it is still A really wild ride after as well. I will first start off by saying the amount of work put into drawing all those balloons in just mindblowing and visually stunning . Also well I may have a bit of a bias Because I have been a scout. I love russell and find him very funny. If there is one problem I have with the movie it's that you will know the villain as soon as you see him. Also the final act of the movie can be a bit ridiculous. But to be fair we are talking about a movie where balloons can lift a whole house. Other than that it is a really fun adventure of a film.,

Pete Docter's ""Up"" portrays elderly Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) attaching balloons to his house and sailing it to a South American waterfall and finding even more than he bargained for. I've never been a fan of Disney, but this one had some out-of-the-ordinary stuff (for a Disney movie, that is), namely when Carl scornfully calls someone a hippie. As far as I can tell, the major theme is the completion of long-standing promises - Carl's deceased wife had long dreamed of going to the waterfall - and Carl's return from the brink of total senility.",

Not enough when you dream to make a full length motion picture and want your audience to relish and reminisce every frame conceived. I did have very high expectations of the movie ever since i read rave reviews from the Cannes fest, also counting the exciting preview screened before Terminator Salvation began. The balloons, the lift, the adventure appealed to me instantly, the lover that i am of 21 balloons. it's with this heightened expectation that i approached the movie and was disappointed by every attempt of Pixar's in creating a story out of an idea. That would be the most frustrating part of any writer's work when a grand idea has to be developed to reach it's end. Sadly this is where the writers lost it. They had a planned and riveting story until the old man (Carl Fredricksen) realizes it's never too late to get started on anything. The plaintive note of Carl's early life all played very well with the setting to escape on a long wished for adventure. Yes the story held me in it's sway UP until this point. This point was stretched so far as to include the 70 year old Carl confronting his childhood idol, Muntz ( who should be about 95+) and is seen walking with ease and in perfect health ( did the writers in their right mind think this made sense at all,), a senseless plot about capturing a bird that loves chocolates, which is by the way the central plot( not the balloon adventure that you thought the movie was about.

In the case of Up, the humor was not at all on par with previous Pixar releases. But the biggest problem was with the setting of the story, i.e. the world they create. In Monsters, Inc they could invent anything, because it was a fictitious world. In Toy Story, the toys could do anything, but the humans were generally bound to the same physical laws as the rest of us. That's where Up makes a gigantic misstep. The main character is rendered very realistically, visually, but does the impossible for an elderly arthritic at every turn (running pulling a house... excuse me?). Where did the talking dog collars come from? The villain is portrayed as a realistic human, but it makes no sense that he might (living in the rain forest, alone) invent a talking dog collar. He's an explorer, not an engineer. This was clearly just something Pixar pulled out of their ""funny ideas to stick in a movie someday"" jar. They should have looked to see if it fit, first.",

They get married and spend their lives together. When Ellie passes away, Carl becomes depressed and forgets about his old promise to Ellie about visiting Paradise Falls in South America. Carl is soon visited by a little boy named Russell, who is trying to get his ""Assisting the Elderly"" badge. Carl soon turns his house into an airship using thousands of balloons. He finds out that Russell was still on his house and assists him in his adventures. Carl runs into his boyhood hero, who actually turns out to be his enemy.

This is the third Pixar movie I have written a review for, and this will also be the third consecutive time that I will open the review with the following sentence: Pixar have done it again. Once again, they have proved that no animation studio – and no live action studio either, for that matter – can come anywhere near the sheer and utter quality of their entertainment, purely and simply put. Pixar have proved once again that they can take a concept and premise that doesn't sound particularly attractive at first, and turn it into a masterwork of cinema. They have proved that unlike their animation studio contemporaries, Pixar don't need celebrity voices and characters specifically designed to be packaged and ready for delivery to toy store shelves, and they certainly don't feel the need to patronize their young audience members by injecting into their films jokes that only parents can understand. And they have proved once again that unlike most live-action studio output, it is still possible to create compelling, dramatic and irresistibly entertaining cinema from original screenplays without falling into formulas, clichés or any other kind of compromise for the sake of the audience. In short, Pixar have once again proved that they are the best film studio working today, period.",

We see the life of widower Carl Fredricksen and his wife Ellie up until the present. Carl (brilliantly voiced by Ed Asner) is a lonely old man, who believes the best part of his life has passed him. In ""Up"" Carl was supposed to go on Ellie's dream trip to Paradise Falls in South America, but this does not happen. Instead of surrendering to a retirement home, Carl decides to go on the trip to Paradise Falls by hooking up a fleet of balloons to his house.

Still, Up is one of the strongest arguments for closing the vote until the hype has passed (Maybe until the movie has been released on DVD?) Along with movies like The Dark Knight, Star Trek and the other Pixar Wall-E it makes me more and more certain that this is the solution. Don't get me wrong, I loved both Wall-E and the Dark Knight, but there still is no way that they're as great as the ratings say. Besides, Star Trek was plain awful. Slumdog Millionaire is probably the only hyped movie I can think of that has landed on an appropriate rating in the end.

Some of us might have heard that this is Pixar's crowning achievement, surpassing the likes of ""Toy Story"" and ""Finding Nemo"". Regardless of the buzz surrounding ""Up"", the film remains, quite simply, one of the finest animated movies of recent history, if not of all time. Yes, the first ten minutes are extremely compelling, and I have never seen a movie achieve its exposition so well in such a subtle way; it's something beyond remarkable. The life of Carl Fredrickson is played out to show the love he shared with his wife, Ellie, and how they had some big dreams that never quite came true. The rest of the movie is a beautiful testament to how love and the spirit of ambition take new forms as life goes on, as Carl befriends Russel, an enthusiastic young scout, Dug, a talking dog, and ""Kevin"", an inappropriately named tropical bird. The way this film tackles heavy issues like loss and grieving is so profound and yet simple enough for any audience member to understand. There's enough laughs to keep the kids interested, enough touching moments for adults, and an amazing sense of adventure for the kid in all of us. I can't really name a favorite movie, but if someone held a gun to my head and forced me to decide, this would certainly be one of the first to cross my mind. Absolutely essential viewing. Perfect.",

This makes for an experience that is just simply amazing, across the board. A tear jerker of an animation, and one hell of a movie. But the expansion of audiences also invites some bad into their otherwise perfect work. I don't wanna give away too much but a high pitched annoying voice and some unexpected plane pilots caused an entire point off for this movie. Nearly two. This may please the younger crowd, but for the older I am afraid it hurt it. It hurt it bad. Besides breaking up the smoothness like a scratching record with this overplayed low-end television trick, it just gives you that gut wrenching feeling in your stomach: They obviously did not preview this movie enough. Now I'm no film critic, but my refrigerator could have caught that one. I mean come on.

Then, of course, we need to suspend out disbelief, thinking that a house, propelled by helium balloons, can be raised from the ground, becoming airborne. What follows is a truly great story. We have a young Wilderness Scout who has all the hangups of modern youth, clueless in so many ways. We have a cast of incredible dogs who have been given the ability to speak through a device invented by the villain of the movie. There are complex relationships that transcend the usual kid plots.

260,25 July 2009,zardoz-13,10, Fly Away House!,"The Pixar animated comedy ""Up"" owes no small amount of its success to the specter of Charles Chaplin. No, Chaplin had nothing to do with this fanciful, first-rate, odd-couple comedy, except that ""Up"" shares something in common with Chaplin's 1921 movie ""The Kid."" The story throws together a grumpy 78 year old retiree and an eight-year old Wilderness Explorer scout and the elder learns how important he is to youngster after his wife has died. This exciting 3-D adventure (it's also available in 2-D) boasts top-flight production values. Indeed, this represents an instance where the characters are so realistically done and voiced that you readily accept them for the people that they play in the film. Mind you, this release may appear to be geared primarily toward adolescents, but adults don't have to worry about getting the short-shrift. There is more depth here beyond the superb 3-D visual effects than you might imagine. Although ""Monsters, Inc."" director Peter Doctor and scenarist Bob Peterson have made a film that epitomizes the spirit of adventure, ""Up"" is not without its poignant heartfelt moments that older viewers will appreciate but younger ones will dismiss.

Carl, however, is an old man who at the end defeats a guy who has to be 90+ years old. Dogs flying airplanes? Please. The talking collars are maybe believable but come on. The hero of Carl's youth kills people who come to ""steal"" his elusive quarry Kevin? Just one more ""loss"" for Carl and the much missed Ellie. Why does Russell remind me of Dash, check his mouth. Why does the black father at the end look like Ice or whatever his name was in The Incredibles? What happened to Russel's father? Why is Carl there at the end and ""mom"" is sitting in the audience? They needed Russel to be an orphan and they couldn't come up with a story line for it. The whole no child section is just too much at the beginning.

There's a lot more to it than that, though. For its majority, it's a fun adventure featuring a grumpy old curmudgeon and a naïve little boy. It also features fictional birds, talking dogs and a balloon-tied house that floats all the way to South America. In some ways, it's strange that these outlandish elements exist alongside some very realistic - even sobering - moments and an incredibly affecting central theme; it's almost like there are two movies in competition with one another. Yet, the picture has an excellent handle on its tone and it never feels close to incohesive. It's entertaining and engaging even at its silliest, with well-rounded characters and a tightly paced plot. The relationship between its leads evolves naturally and the piece's payoff is incredibly satisfying. It's an enjoyable experience right the way through.

But, they're now 10-for-10 with 'Up' a brilliantly colorful and original story, filled with heart, adventure, comedy and finally a talking animal that not only explains why he (or they) can talk, but what they would really say vs. the writers humanizing them. Also, the movie opens with a great, yet somewhat slow, monologue explaining the background on the main character, Carl, vs. just telling us he's old and grumpy. At a very young age, Carl befriends an equally adventurous young female and its love-at-first-sight. They marry, but their dreams of Indiana Jones adventure is curbed by everyday life. After she passes, and his neighborhood follows, Carl takes flight, literally, avoiding certain doom in a retirement home. Stowaway Wilderness Explorer 8-year-old Russell helps him try and find Carl's (and late wife's) final destination in South America. Comedy ensues, as the life-lessons-learned and typical sidekicks. Best of the bunch is the aforementioned talking dog, Dug. He was hilarious, interesting and like I said, finally an un-humanized cartoon speaking animal. Okay, now the bad, not that there's much to say negative and this certainly wasn't the weakest, though still way above average, of the Pixar bunch. I saw it in 3-D, and it truly was NOT amazing in 3-D. 'Monsters Vs. Aliens' in IMAX was 10x better in 3-D quality and quality. 'Up' was also incredibly predictable, was funny at times – but not all the time and the trailers gave away too much, gave some background on the boy's father and some woman in his life, but never explored it fully and finally, I seriously can't believe CPS wouldn't be following with all the extreme dangers the child was in.",

282,1 June 2009,cultfilmfan,10, Up,"Up is a new family friendly 3D animated feature from Walt Disney Studios and Pixar Animation. I do not always go to see family films, usually because I feel they are aimed at more of a younger audience and there is not much for me to enjoy, or be entertained by. Up is a different story entirely. Once, I started to see all the glowing reviews of the film, I figured I would at least give it a chance and I was so glad I did. I think there is a lot here that adults will enjoy and reflect upon and enough that will entertain children and keep them interested and make them laugh. For adults the plot does deal with aging and overcoming obstacles and learning to reach your dreams and deal with the sadness and loneliness in your life. The film does briefly deal with some of these issues which are more, or less things that will happen to everyone of us at some point in our lives, which is just a natural part of getting older and losing our mobility and perhaps losing the ones we love. Although we all know this will happen to us sooner than later, as the film shows, it is still not easy. While some adults may feel that these issues are not what they would want to subject their children to, don't worry because this film is a great film to see with the whole family and while there are some mature and thematic elements to it, it is nothing a child could not handle and it is not done in a disrespectful, or disturbing way. It may be sad, but wasn't also a lot of other Disney films that children have been watching for years? Also for the youngsters in the audience the film deals with adventure and again following your dreams, making friends and doing the right thing. Both of the main characters in the film seem to learn these life lessons from one another and they make a captivating, funny and charming two leads to this film. While, I appreciated the subtle and more thematic moments of the film there was still a lot of uplifting moments that were both touching and sweet. There was a lot of comedy as we are introduced to some wonderfully creative creatures later in the film and also a subplot that deals with good versus evil and a final showdown that will keep everybody watching. Up is a thoughtful and sometimes thought provoking film, but it still has the other qualities like humour, magic and adventure that families love about these kind of films. Not to mention that I really enjoyed the animation as well. I left the audience feeling really uplifted at the end of this film and it was a thoroughly entertaining 90 minute film and sometimes I even wish it had been longer. Another great addition to this year's lineup of movies including Adventureland and Drag Me To Hell (not family films though) and one of the best films of the year so far.",

Now, Pixar proudly brings us, 'Up'. 'Up' is a tale of a young boy,named Carl Fredricksen,who just wants to follow in the footsteps of his hero,adventurer, Charles Muntz,and travel to South America to find a hidden waterfall paradise. The ensuing years manage to side track Carl's dreams (in a wordless montage that will go for the heart strings). Carl is now an old man (voiced by veteran actor,Ed Asner),who's home is scheduled to be demolished to make room for apartments,and seems doomed to spend the rest of his life in a nursing home when he has the idea to tie thousands of helium filled balloons & float away. Unbenownst to Carl,a young boy scout,Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai)stows away on his porch. Carl has no other choice but to bring Russell along. What follows is a series of adventures for Carl,Russell,and a dog named Dug (voiced by co writer, co director,Bob Peterson)to South America,where they manage to find not just Carl's boyhood hero,Charles Muntz (voiced by Christopher Plummer),but an ultra rare bird,which Russell takes a fancy to (and vice versa). Bob Peterson co writes & directs,with Pete Docter (who also provides some voice overs for a character named Campmaster Strauch),from a story by Peterson,Docter & Thomas McCarthy. The film has some impressive cinematography & editing. What I really admired was the fact that,despite a Disney production,doesn't have the usual sappy Disney-esquire songs that only manage to pad the film out. I eagerly await Pixar's next entry. Available in certain areas in Digital Disney 3D,and standard 2D for cinemas that are not equipped for 3D screenings.

On top of that, why was he still alive and physically superior to our 78-year-old protagonist who was obviously much younger than he?

As a result he is going to be sent to a nursing home but before they take him he unleashes balloons attached to his house, which lifts up his house off the ground so he can go to South America which him and his wife always wanted to do. Unbeknownst to him, a little boy was under the house at the time, who needs to get his badge for helping the elderly. The boy is funny and brings most of the humour to the movie but it's really about friendships and doing things you love. The annoying things I found were the talking dogs.

It has a near perfect balance of drama and comedy, it had loads heartwarming and upsetting scenes that genuinely made me cry, but it also had plenty of very funny parts and hilarious characters that brought light to the film, such as Dug, and this movie brought me so much joy to watch, and I will certainly be seeing it again and again. My only problem with the movie, and it's a very small one, is that I didn't feel we got to see Ellie develop enough, I know exactly what they were doing with that montage and it was terrific, but I would like to have seen a bit more of her beforehand so that I would feel so much more sympathy once the montage came along, although seens revolving around her later on were the parts that real warmed my heart. Carl Fredicksen is easily one of Pixars best written characters ever, he has so much depth and he is very human, I felt so much sympathy for him and can relate to his struggles to not want to let go of the things that mean so much to him, it's quite hard to believe that this very real character is computer animated.

294,20 January 2019,tabuno,8, A Fabulous But Uneasy Adult/Family Animated Movie,"5 July 2009. ""Up"" attempts the difficult fusion of both children and adult elements in the same movie and usually succeeds marvelously at both. This sharp, 3-D animated movie handles both roarously funny scenes along with dramatic emotional scenes dealing with love, growing old, and the issue of what's important in life. However, as a serious movie, it attempts to incorporate childlike fantasy elements and sometimes the rigors of logical and reasonable cause and effect go out the window which would be no problem in a traditional animated movie directed towards young people. But ""Up"" in attempting to have it both, both serious grown-up issues and thoughtful scenes, it brings with it an expectation of a tighter reign on more realistic scenes regarding chases and escapes while thrilling go beyond plausibility, breaking the suspension of animated realism, which when 3-D is used actually increases the need for virtual practical sequences. Overall however, this movie is captivated with fabulous colors, the action is riveting, the plot outline decently strong and in some instances even more intimate than Coraline (2009). 8/10.",

It's par with Pixar.,"Maybe I came in with too high of expectations, but I know I'm not the only one who thinks that this movie wasn't so great. It was just OK. It had funny lines, -all of which were already shown in the previews-, and a pretty good plot, and great animation. But I just don't see why so many people think this is such an ""awesome"" movie. There was no adult humor at all, so maybe all the ratings are from parents or children, I don't know. I think the 3d version must be a whole different movie than the one I saw, because I walked out thinking it was just mediocre. Heres some advise, do Not watch it if it's not in 3D, you'll probably be disappointed as well.",
296,4 January 2016,lisafordeay,8, At first I actually hated this movie but now I actually really like this film.,"Up is a Oscar winning animated film from Pixar that tells the story of an elderly man who whisks his house away by using balloons and goes to the falls where his deceased wife wanted to go. Along the journey he teams up with a scout named Russell,a dog named Dug and a peacock and together they go off on an adventure. The animation in this film is very well done and the first 10 minutes of this film is very sentimental where we see Carl(Ed Asher from Elf)who meets his future wife who was a real tomboy and we as the audience get to see them growing up to actually falling in love to actually growing old together. That was just genius the way the filmmakers did this. Also the story is very good too and if you haven't seen this movie I strongly recommend it. ",

302,9 August 2009,Dr_Coulardeau,8, You can't teach an old dog new tricks,"Walt Disney has done better animated films in the past. This one is rather average. But it is important because it shows a radical change in the targeted audience. The concept of family audience has completely changed. The kids are no longer accompanied by their parents but by their grand-parents. So the film targets these grand-parents as a potential audience and is built on two main characters, the child and the senior citizen. The whole film is based on this crossing over three generations. Then the film is also aiming at a younger audience that is living in decomposed more than recomposed families and the child is thus living with his father and another woman than his mother, and he is systematically betrayed, in spite of what he mat say, by his father. The boy scouts are shown as particularly father-centered if not male-chauvinistic by not allowing a boy to be supported by another person than his father when receiving medals in some ritual ceremony, the father or another fatherly man, but not the mother. A very long tradition with Walt Disney: their support of the family structure like with Ebenezer Scrooge in the famous Christmas Carol, or of course Snow White and Cinderella. Fathers are not particularly enhanced and step mothers are frankly demonized. The animals of the film are not essential, just some kind of mirror in which children will be able to recognize their phantasms and dreams. But this film is absolutely Anglo-Saxon and based on a myth from this culture and this culture only, or nearly, and particularly the English branch of that myth and culture, the Lost World of Conan Doyle, the belief in the existence of a pocket or virginal nature surviving behind un-crossable mountains that can only be reached by air with a blimp or a flying house. It is thus normal to have some paradise cataract and a bird of paradise, a giant one mind you, and of course this bird will have three chicks, a trinity that is there to sanctify this virginal world, this garden of Eden. At a time when Jules Verne was looking for adventures that contained a great quantity of danger, Conan Doyle was dreaming of the rediscovery of the garden of Eden. Charles Muntz has little to do with Captain Nemo. In fact he has no humanity at all, not even the good sense to forget about, and forgive, the dumbness of human beings. He is ready to kill a child and destroy a bird of paradise and doom its – her actually – chicks to perdition for his own vanity. It is these particularities that make the film interesting, but it does not have the finesse and the subtlety of Ratatouille. The allusions to American culture are numerous but it would be fastidious to give them all, like the small house surrounded by high rise buildings (Death of a Salesman). These allusions are aimed at the adult and elderly audience of course. But I can't resist asking one final question: is the Shady Oaks retirement home covering some shady business or some shaky eugenic mentality concerning the elderly?

303,16 March 2010,johnnyboyz,7," Stands on its own as the animated film with all the individual high profile accolades; and Up is a pleasant piece, blending a number of fun ideas and affecting content.","One wonders if 2009's animated feature 'Up' will be the mark of change in certain areas. Here's a film of an animated ilk that not only opened the 2009 Cannes film festival, but became the first since 1991's Beauty and the Beast, and only the second ever, to receive a best picture academy award nomination. The heavy spate of films throughout the whole of the last decade, those of a kind that saw them animated but rendered by way of computers, have enchanted and engrossed children and adults alike; but one wonders if, amidst the higher-ups that are entrenched within the nether regions of The Academy and premiere occasions across the European film festival circuit, those in charge have ever seen any of them as anything more than just a bunch of cartoons produced in order to merely satisfy and entertain. Up's recognition at Europe's best known, but not necessarily best loved, film festival gathering plus domestic acknowledgement at The Oscars, even if it was never going to win, might mark Up down as more significant over time than the creators first had in mind.",

He meets Ellie, a neighbor who shares his passion for nature. When they grow up they marry, but are unable to have children. He sells balloons and she works at a zoo. They have always intended to travel to South America to verify Muntz's claims to clear his name. The best laid plans of mice and men prevent it and Elle dies, leaving Carl alone.

The scene was so well animated, and the idea seemed so inspired, it was as if every shred of cynicism I had about movies was vaporized. ""That's right, movies CAN be magical!"" I thought.

It has the colorful animation that is to get lost in. It has the well grounded set of characters that deliver the pathos. But it also contains several of the Pixar well -worn devices and plotting. The opening segment for example is the exposition framing device that is also used in The Incredibles, and Ratatouille. The Muntz being a darker version of Carl is very much like Marlin and Gil in Finding Nemo. Dug, Kevin come off as lesser versions of Dory. Nothing is bad or off and the film is gem on its own.

Maybe this puts me in the 'old fart' category, not being over-impressed by whiz-bang digital computer-generated graphics. I find the Pixar visual style irritating rather than appealing, and for me the super-slick, ugly, unappealing visuals tend to overshadow the story-line, dialogue, etc. 'Up' had quite a good story but it tended towards the clichéd and while there were some amusing moments I found myself wriggling in my seat and wondering how much longer I would have to sit there.

323,30 May 2009,arthera09,10, This is why Pixar is the best there is,"What can I say about this movie. It is perfect in every way. First of all it looked beautiful and probably not as mind blowing as some of Pixar's in terms of visuals it still looks great. The second thing is that the voice acting is top notch like always and nothing less than one would expect. The music never stood out and over powered a scene but there were definitely moments when there would be a little piano melody that would really tug at the heart strings. I guess the most important thing about a movie like this is the story which was told masterfully by Peter Doctor. If I could a favorite Pixar director it maybe Peter Doctor mainly because I think he has the ability to tell a very adult story that never strays away from being a children's film. He totally nailed it Monster's Inc. and was probably for me one of the more emotionally moving Pixar film, or film in general for me right after this one. If you try to explain to someone this movie just in terms of the the character arc it is a very grownup story, but Pixar puts in in the perfect amount of heart, warmth, humor and just magic in general. I do not think I even need to point out any particular moment, but so much of it is just perfect. If I did have one complaint it would be I wish I would have seen some sort of resolution with respect to Russel's character and his father. Now I must say a word about the environment that I saw the movie in. I saw it at 2:10 in the afternoon with nothing other than kids and their mothers. There was a little girl maybe 3 or 4 sitting next to me with her mom that had to keep getting up to go to the bathroom. Except she only had to go when the movie slowed down with respect to a personal moment for Carl. As soon as some action picked the little girl could have cared less about going to the bathroom. Their was chatter all around me, but I loved it. It was perfect. The parents laughed at moments aimed at them and the kids laughed at moments aimed at them and then we all laughed at the moment when it was right. I loved the experience.

The storyline is one that is bent more toward the adult, and true empathy for the characters is unique to this film. The kids may enjoy the special effects and cartoon animals, however, the adults will appreciate the kind and gentle approach to the elderly that is a welcome change in the cartoon world.

The first is the unique casting of an Asian lead character, a cherubic, hyper-curious nine-year-old Japanese-American Wilderness Explorer stowaway named Russell. The second is the reference to Fenton's Creamery, which is a two-minute walk from my former home in Oakland. Beyond those two points is a surprisingly mature, sometimes melancholy comedy adventure that focuses on a 78-year-old protagonist whose self-proclaimed destiny is to visit a mythical place that he and his wife have dreamed about ever since they first met.

It's by no means a bad movie, but the story wasn't focused enough - what is the point of the movie? - pieces of information sort of patched together - what does the movie want say thematically - the movie has trouble flowing or connecting well. This isn't meant to be a huge criticism, and it's not to say it's not entertaining. ""Up"" has some genuinely funny moments (especially with the dog collars and whole dog scenes). The Russel character wear's thin sometimes contrasted with moments with ""Kevin"" that are interesting, alive, and well paced.

This run-of-the-mill Disney/Hollywood action is only interrupted towards the end when the film remembers that it has an idea and that it needs to convey a message. It reveals what our true ""lives adventures"" are; this part and the beginning of the film earned the 7 stars from me.

The animation, as to be expected, was stunning. The character design and ballooning portions of the film were exceptionally crafted. The story, however, was lacking. The first 30 minutes were perfect, exuding a level of maturity I didn't expect from a Pixar film. With minimal dialogue, the expressive cinematography was emotionally effective, reminiscent of the best moments in the nearly silent Wall E. The summation of Carl's life with his wife was absolutely beautiful. It is truly one of Pixar's finest moments, and one of the best scenes of 2009 thus far. Once Carl's journey got underway, however, the film took on a far younger sophistication, with cutesy side-characters and inane slapstick moments thrown in to keep younger audiences awake. Kevin the bird was especially annoying. On the other hand, the dogs were hilarious and creatively crafted, garnering some of the best moments in the film. Overall, I thought UP was an enjoyable, if somewhat underwhelming film that could have been so much more if it didn't noticeably pander to younger audiences.

Though you didn't know this character too well at this point, you felt for him rather deeply by seeing his life progress, start to end. This flow of life from childhood to old age is an immediately identifiable aspect of the movie. Anyone with a depth of personality and a reflective side, can identify with this.

In ""The Incredibles"" this could be seen in the normal life of a family and the existence of, primarily, a real world; but the characters were superheroes. Brad Bird doubled the bet with ""Ratatouille"": the non-verbal communication between a rat and a human, the logic possibility of thinking anyone can cook and a rat finally doing it, in an entire human world.

UP tugs harder on the heart-strings during its first 10 minutes than any cartoon in history (for adult viewers, at least). Though this film may give pause to wise and\or precocious kids, such children should have no trouble adding this to their daily dose of doom and gloom. The opening chapter to this story parallels one of the best-loved baby boomer picture books, Virginia Lee Burton's 1942 THE LITTLE HOUSE. However, it uses Asner as a stand-in for actor Frank Morgan's gruff WIZARD OF OZ (1939), whisking an elderly city man rather than a Kansan girl to a cross between LAND OF THE LOST and the current TV show LOST (as in, will this whole bizarre episode turn out just to be Carl's post-traumatic-stress-induced dream, making him a geriatric version of Dorothy Gale?). Carl's chance companion for this trip, would-be boy camper Russell, shares enough of the spirit of young Carl in the movie's opening sequence to shade the rest of the film with a sense of deep irony. Though poignant and bittersweet, this cartoon is fresh, fun, and human enough to merit a projection of its future as a classic with staying power, along the lines of Bambi or Pinocchio.",

Both kids grew up together with passion for adventures and throughout the sequence we the audience see how they move on in life, get married, face challenges and funny moments until finally Eli passes away, leaving Carl alone. That sequence only shows many features of life and emotions. You get many scenes like this throughout the movie but the opening sequence is the memorable one. Up is an amazing movie, full of humor and emotion. The idea of a man who seeks to bring his house to South America with an enormous amount of balloons making his house fly is just a funny and original idea I looked up to as a kid. The relationship between Carl and Russell is great, every moment together on screen is a piece of art. The idea of the snipe Kevin and the dogs with the talking Colors.

Maybe those expectations ruined it for me, as expectations often do, but I really don't think this movie deserves a spot this high. Okay, it's funny. But so are Monsters Inc., Wall-E, Finding Nemo and countless others. The story is imaginative and entertaining, but no magic. The plot tries to push us through a wide range of emotions, but the movie's sugar-coated, candy-like look and slapstick nature kept me from identifying too much with its fairly shallow characters. A while ago, I saw ""Spirited Away"", a movie that touches the soul, takes you into a land beyond your wildest imaginations and leaves you with magical, dreamlike images you won't forget for a long time.

397,27 September 2009,Likes_Ninjas90,9, This is an animated film that truly soars.,"As a child Carl Fredricksen (Edward Asner) was always interested in adventure. He shared this passion with his childhood friend and sweetheart Ellie. They were both fans of the explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) and when they married they had always planned to travel to South America. Yet through the opening montage of Up we learn that Carl and Ellie weren't always able to fulfil their life goals together, such as travelling or having children. In the present day, as a cranky old man and a widower, Carl is still living in the same house and neighbourhood. He wishes to be left alone, particularly when he is bothered by a young scout named Russell (Jordan Nagai). Yet following an altercation with a construction worker, Carl is set to be moved out of his home. To avoid being put into a retirement village he attaches hundreds of balloons to his house to fly to South American for an adventure, unaware that Russell is onboard as well.",
398,2 June 2009,BigWhiskers,10, Wonderful movie -,"Just got back from seeing ""UP"" and it was a very entertaining movie. Lots of neat special effects and it really did make you feel as if you were up in the air with the main characters. The plot involving a 76 yo man Carl Fredericksen wanting to experience adventure before he dies is charming and heartfelt. Along with him for various parts of his journey are a young cub scout and other characters like a talking dog and a large bird. I can see why the movie is rated PG though as their are some parts that I think would be too scary or too intense for the under 10 crowd - such as the part where one dog brutally bites another dog and throws it off a cliff and the duel between Carl and Charles Muntz which is rather intense- Carl gets kicked in the chest by Muntz and nearly impaled several times while fighting Muntz who is armed with a large sword.",

A young boy scout accidentally follows him during the journey. When they finally get there, they discover a rare colorful bird who must be protected from a vicious poacher and his dogs. This is one of Pixar's more mature efforts (indicated by the PG rating). The movie knows how to be charming, personal, and observant all at once.

407,29 May 2009,megatom5,10, Amazing Pixar film,"I've been a pixar film since 10 years old ever since I first saw toy story and fell in love with those characters. Ever since then I've become a bigger and greater film fan and pixar I feel has kept up with that. With Incredibles they did one of the best superhero movies and with wall-e I felt they had made a sincerely great entry into the scifi genre. Up is an action/adventure movie on par with the early Indian jones movies, except for the exception that the main character is about as old as the latest Indian jones movie. This is honestly one of pixar's sadder films. I am tempted to say darker but the film is honestly a light hearted adventure once it get going. The first 20 minutes are sheer sadness though. Not since the Lion King have I felt such empathy for an animated character. From the first scenes you know that it's headed toward eventual tragedy, but this is where the story of Up picks up from. It begins with a tragedy then moves into an action adventure, unlike any film I've ever seen before. I love the characters I love the setting, I just genuinely love this movie. It's got a true blue heart but it's not afraid to make you laugh, cry, and feel the intensity that the characters feel. Additionally the Disney 3-d is amazing, this isn't the type of movie where I felt that they went out of there way to make it 3-d (i.e. Beowulf My Bloody Valentine) but the effect is quite riveting. On top of a fantastic film you get a 3-d preview of Toy Story 3, which honestly had me giddy with joy. Especially after seeing how great Up looked in it. I feel like Pixar keeps getting more ambitious with their films, Wall-e contained a blatant political message, while this film is significantly heavier than any animated film I've seen. It's about remorse and lost time, and is a reminder of why we should live our lives to fullest.",
408,30 May 2009,spradley-3,10, More than fabulous animation - see it with someone you love!,"I'll start by saying that I am usually taking my daughters to these animated films and have not been engaged in any of these until WALL-E. However, even with WALL-E- beyond the relationship of the two robots, the rest was done well but ... Anyway - UP was different. ******Lots of spoilers******** The film starts with Carl as a young boy, getting into mischief, meeting his wife - also very young. Still in the opening scenes, with essentially no dialog just images- we are taken through Carl's life and tender moments with his wife. It is truly moving, their love through difficult moments but mostly happy, together times. Then Carl is 78 years old - it is today - and he's alone. For me, half of the film was about Carl's fulfilling his promise to his wife, to make their home in a special, beautiful spot in South America: their special adventure. As Carl embarks upon this endeavor, he meets wonderful, endearing characters whose personalities shine with and without words. The way that Pixar weaves stories with so little words is incredible. The animation is wonderfully detailed and beautiful - you could see individual fur on the dogs, intricate feathers on the bird and stubble chin hair on Carl. The adventure has the usual villain but (for the adults), the second emphasis of the story is about Carl letting go of his loneliness and sadness after losing his wife and becoming engaged in life again. His wife had started a scrapbook when they met as children, about the greatest adventure she wanted to have in life - being the trip to South America. Carl always thought the pages after the ""Great stuff I want to do"" in his wife's scrapbook was empty because they had never gotten to go to South America. At the end of the movie, he moves past that page to find that her scrapbook is filled with pictures of all the times they had together - that those were her best adventures. Amid all of the characters, comedy and activities which had the audience laughing and cheering, was the kind of love we all search for: enduring, fun, tender - and how hard it is to lose that love. You could feel Carl's sadness. Very moving, poignant - absolutely worth the tears. It will help you value your loves more while you have them. And the movie is filled with smiles too. The kids won't understand why there are tears in your eyes...",

The humor is excellent as well, and of course, doesn't rely on the raunchiness of the R-rated comedies to get laughs. There are a lot of great messages in this movie that have probably already been discussed by others, so I won't get into it, but you do come away with a little better understanding of what is important in life.

417,21 December 2020,baileycrawly,7, Emotions Before Story,"Up is a bit of an anomaly in the sense that it's got emotional potential, but the primary scene in which most viewers report breaking down in tears (the first 10 minutes) provoked absolutely no emotion in me. Truth be told, there wasn't enough context and interaction between the characters to develop any kind of emotional resonance with them, and therefore when you watch the lives of Carl and Ellie unfold, there's really nothing more there for me than a series of events strung together in a mini anthology. And so, going into this film, I was of the impression that the only thing the film had going for itself was in those first ten minutes.
However, that's not the case. This movie gets its emotion in ways that are a lot more subtle, and the tears don't flow for me until nearer the conclusion, as is the case with a lot of Pixar films. It's not a ""sob for the last half-hour"" kind of film like, for instance, Coco was, but the emotional moments are genuinely sweet, and the tears are certainly warranted.
The story is quite weak. Coming from the production company that managed to make a cowboy doll coming to life feel like a character we know and love, the fact that this story crosses the line is borderline hysterical. It's not the story itself that drags the movie down; it's more in the execution and I couldn't help but wonder if, from any other studio, this film might've been a complete flop. The plot (particularly the final act) feels underdeveloped; it could've used another handful of meetings to brainstorm better ideas. When it comes to defeating the antagonist, everything happens relatively suddenly and feels dissatisfying.
The voice acting is okay, but...
SQUIRREL!
...it gets annoying at times, particularly Russell. The kid is nothing short of insufferable and, although you're only with him for about an hour, you just want to see Carl throw him off the deck of the house at every possible instance.
In conclusion, Up is an okay film, but it's bordering on average. It doesn't mean it's one you should skip, but from a studio with the track record of Pixar, this is definitely more of a miss than their previous work. Beautifully animated and scored, the plot is thin and lacking enough substance to truly leave any sort of lasting impact despite the sickly-sweet emotional segments.",

The story begins on a touching note, with beautiful short-cut vignettes that demonstrate the passing of time and the developing of a relationship. After that, the film bogs down to a routine action/adventure, rendered more fantastic, perhaps, than the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" series only because of the lack of constraints that the medium of animation allows. For me, the unhinging of the imagination afforded the creative team was wasted on extravagant but silly, over-the-top, plotting. I don't routinely seek out animated movies, but the word on the street for this one was compelling -- almost irresistible. Worth a look, sure. I expected to be blown away, but I found myself checking my watch about an hour into the show.",

While I found the animation to be as amazing as always, the plot was depressing and downright boring for much of it. I didn't care about the characters at all (except maybe Dug) and the talking dogs were about the only decent laugh I found in the whole thing. I am completely baffled at this high of a rating (it was 8.5 at the time of this post with over 50,000 votes). Maybe I'm in a off mood but I don't think so. Anyway, maybe I have gotten to the point that i expect much more from Pixar. Doing a little looking into it this has a higher rating than Toy Story (8.1), Incredibles (8.2), and Finding Nemo (8.3). WTF?!?!?!?!? Those are all much better films by far. I have seen them all numerous times and never got bored once. I couldn't barely make it through UP hardly once!",
423,15 June 2009,socrates99,8, I was surprised 'Up' wasn't better though it's great anyway,"The problem is the storyline. Love parts of it, like the review of the old man's past life, and the tie-in to what he finds in South America. But some of the contrivances are as annoying as they are helpful, for example, the device that lets dogs talk. And then there's the way the floating house seems to drag the action down in places. Still, the many little quirks of an old man embodied in Mr Fredricksen's figure are pretty much breathtaking as is those of a young boy embodied in Russell. Ellie is fleshed out as a character so quickly and assuredly that I was flummoxed trying to imagine what kind of a team could have produced her. But then most of the art work is completely awe-inspiring and entrancing. (I found the bird Kevin to be disappointing, though.) I guess I would have made the story a little less wild, these films deserve to be instant classics, and I can't help feeling some of the more wild parts are going to hold it back. By the way the opening cartoon about storks delivering babies was a complete pleasant surprise and a clear indication of the level of genius at Pixar. I'm guessing they wanted us to practice dropping our mouths open.",

Within the first fifteen minutes of the film lies a contextualising montage. With almost no dialogue, and very little screen time, it told a story that ripped my heart out.

444,13 August 2009,Jackpollins,10, Nothing short of perfect,"Up is one those rare family films that completely speaks to both kids and adults. It is funny and touching with jokes and sweet moments that both kids and adults will love. This is the story of Carl Fredricksen (voice of Ed Asner), who tied a 1,000 balloons to his house when his wife, Ellie dies. There's even a nice montage at the beginning of the movie about Carl's life, and how his life went downhill after his wife died. Now he lives in a house surrounded by construction, and one day, when a man is tearing down his mailbox, Carl attacks the man. So, when he is forced to go to a retirement home, he instead puts the balloons to the test. He soon takes in a boy scout named Russell (Jordan Nagai) when he finds him on the porch. Yes, this isn't realistic at all. There is no way a man can make a house fly, but it's by far Pixar's best film so far. The subplot involving Carl's hero, Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) trying to take Carl down is also interesting. This is probably the best family film ever made, and it nicely teaches difficult subjects like death and aging to a way that can speak to both kids and adults.",

My four year old was in tears when we had to explain that the brilliant goofy exploreress had grown old and died. She then proceeded to ask questions about her all through the film.

Seen in 3D it is on occasion very close to real - the coat of one of the dogs was very lifelike for example. As an entertainment I don't think its intended audience is really children. It's for parents and other adults who are generally child friendly. The story effectively pokes and evokes emotional responses. I cried at one point and it was evident to me that the whole audience at the cinema I attended were also similarly affected. This is an incredible feat for animation - but not unknown. The heavy emphasis on sentimentality however, I found detracted from the Lost World Adventure story that it should really have been about. Admittedly, the Venezuelan scenes were beautifully done, the was even a rainbow on the waterfall - as occurs in life, the subdued mood created by the first segment of the film could not be erased.

In a slow season of movies, and the year is almost halfway done, I am glad I can write about an outstanding animated feature that would appeal to all ages. I like this one much better than ""Monsters vs. Aliens,"" the previous film I reviewed because this movie relies on careful character development and an interesting story, rather than ""Guess which celebrity does this voice? Pick out the celebrity's personality and features in the drawings and you'll know who,"" needless pop culture references which can bore the most discerning adult film-goer, and violent action. That's right. The reason why Pixar animated movies, and ""Up"" is the 10th Pixar movie, always do so well, I can say even better than DreamWorks animation, because they are interested in plots and characters, where most DreamWorks animated movies in recent years such as ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" can border on vulgar pop culture and celebrity parodies.",

They shared plans of visiting a place in South America called Paradise Falls, where Charles had discovered an exotic creature that was difficult to capture.

491,17 July 2009,kyle-cruse,8," After three lesser entries, well deserved","Pixar has, in my opinion, delivered the finest computer animated films to date. However, Pixar's three entries before this film (""Cars,"" ""Ratatoille,"" and ""Wall-E"", though most people will disagree with me on the last one) were, I feel, lesser entries. The last three did not have the overall appeal value that the previous films (""Toy Story,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" etc) had. ""Up"" is a pleasant surprise in nearly every way. What a fantastic concept this film has, featuring a house floated away by a massive amount of small helium-filled balloons (I mean, who doesn't think it would be neat to have their house fly?) Of course, a great concept deserves an equally well-written plot and screenplay, and this film pulls off both of those. The film involves Carl, an old man trying to keep his late wife's dream alive by going to Paradise Falls to prove that their childhood hero, explorer Charles Muntz, was not lying when he said he had traveled there. Along the way, he picks up a young boy scout and a few animals to continue the journey together. This film features who is probably the all-time greatest movie dog character, Dug, a dog who says just what he thinks due to his automated voice collar. What a brilliant concept, rather than the overused one involving animals talking with moving lips. There's too much to share about this film in one review, but the most important thing to say is that I recommend it.

The best thing for me, personally, was that I dreamed of going to Guiana highlands all my childhood. From the trailer, I had no idea that's what this was about.

I don't want to give away any spoilers, but there's really nothing to spoil.

Up is Disney/Pixar's latest adventure and their first in 3-D (which looks colorful by the way). Our story starts off with Carl Fredrickson a grumpy old man who's missed the train, and is still mourning the death of his beloved wife. Until one day he decides to travel to Paradise Falls (a jungle in South America) by tying 100 balloons to his house and exploding into thin air. Taking along a young wilderness explorer named Russell, Carl is determined to finish his journey while honoring his late wife's dream in the process. Disney/Pixar have been making nothing but Art ever since they first started and this is no exception. Up is a delightfully funny, sweet, and heartfelt dramady that will make you smile and shred a tear at the same time. It also has a good message about moving on and the chemistry between Russell and Carl is a good example of a strong friendship and true male bonding. There's nothing to complain about here as I haven't seen a single flaw but young viewers maybe frightened by the appearances of the dogs. They turn out friendly, but are creepy enough to scare the kids. That said this is a movie event you can take anyone (your parents or grandparents in particular) to.

The storyline was probably a bit over my daughter's head but she was drawn to the characters Dug the dog and Kevin the bird so it didn't make much difference. She was giggling through out the movie over their antics. My 8 year old son was drawn to the idea of a flying house and the adventurousness of the story as well as the characters. Certain parts of the story had my girlfriends and I getting choked up and teary eyed but that aspect of the story was over their head. There are a couple take aways from this movie depending on how old you are and not wanting to spoil it I will leave it at that. I highly recommend this movie! See it as a family if you can.

From this perspective, Pixar is an outright fairytale factory. Whether it's the naive ideal of its movie content or its reputation that hasn't faded for more than ten years, the little table lamp that is bouncing around is probably the farthest away from the words disappointment these years.

The animation is pristinely captured and rendered, making each scene colorful (in the elderly person style, but it fits) and completely watchable at worst. The characters are a blast to have on screen or off (if Russell is a tad obnoxious), and the story has among the best balances of originality and cliché I have seen in a Pixar movie (up there with Monsters. Inc, which didn't take too much advantage of its originality), all because of its execution. The prologue, of course, is what most people will hold memories of, connecting to the lives of any widowers or widows who might watch this movie with their grandchildren or someone else. Even after leaving it, Pixar put in quite an amount of labor in creating the Venezuelan rainforest that the rest of the movie would be set in (please do not take that literally). The jokes work as does the action, and it sums up to a movie that anyone would (or should) appreciate. Pixar, you have crafted another champion, and I have optimism that you will continue to do so in the future (little did I know that only one movie past this point until the Dark Age would be such).",

At least Toy Story had a semi-credible story line and Finding Nemo made sense from beginning to end. We wasted $9 apiece for this piece of dreck!

Script's fine, but it has some glimmers of really good writing. The character development with the main character is great and touching, especially that scene when Fredricksen opens the book near the end, finally being able to move on from the burden grief of his wife's death. The chemistry between the unlikely duo Russell and Fredricksen along with the funny sidekicks are wholesome to watch, visuals and score are amazing as always, one of the Giacchino's best for sure.

540,22 March 2010,manicman84,10," unforgettable movie, equally laugh-out-loud funny and wistfully nostalgic","Pixar are continuing their winning streak with this uplifting (yeah!) masterwork. ""Up"" takes an unusual, awkward premise and turns it into an unforgettable movie, equally laugh-out-loud funny and wistfully nostalgic. Let's start from the beginning. The first 10-minute montage depicting elderly Carl Friedrikson's life is mesmerizing to the point that it ranks among the most poignant ones ever created. What's following is more adventure/comedy-oriented material with its blend of electrifying action sequences resembling ""The Incredibes"". Up's own identity is unquestionable though. In a nutshell, the movie is about putting the past in perspective, about gaining the distance to the past events and eventually accepting them. All three central characters deal with a painful loss of some kind. Carl mourns her late wife Ellie, young Russell misses his now distant father and ex-celebrity adventurer turned villain Charles Muntz has lost his credibility chasing supposedly imaginary bird. It's not the climax that matters here that much, but the journey towards this finality. On their journey, Carl and Russell meet a wonderfully goofy bird named Kevin and a sweet talking dog called Dug. Their adventures, albeit exciting, require certain risks and sacrifices. ""Up"" blends fantastic with realistic: it's the first Pixar film where blood is visibly shed and death is dealt with so prominently. All these adult themes may seem too much for a kid-friendly movie, but directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson do such a wonderful job of keeping all the aspects of the story balanced and characters easily reliable. ""Up"" is a fully accomplished exercise in escapism that soars every time it should fall. Superbly executed and enthralling in its ideas, it raises the bar so immensely high.",

Walking out of Up I felt the same joy that I did walking out of Finding Nemo or Toy Story with one distinct difference: I felt like the target audience was different for Up than for all other Pixar movies. All previous Pixar films left me with the impression that they were created for kids, but not just for kids. They could, and were, appreciated by all generations despite having kids as the target audience because they were so finely crafted. For me, Up has the same characteristic of being enjoyable to all ages, but I really felt like it was targeted to adults. The themes and issues, while appealing to kids, will resonate more strongly with adults. The format and content were definitely kid-friendly, but I hope the animated style doesn't dissuade adults from going to see it regardless of whether or not they have kids with them.

Behind the childish aspect, Up addresses themes that everyone will have or have already faced in their life. It is not just a children's movie, it's not even a children's movie in my opinion ! This film is balancing wonderfully the heartbreaking and the heartwarming, you don't have the time to be bored and the soundtrack that goes perfectly with the scenes makes it even more emotional. That was the first time in my life I cried in the first ten minutes of a film and there was still some scenes to come that made me cry like a baby. The characters are touching and greatly voiced, you only want them to be happy ! My favorite song was the one in the opening scene, «Married for life». The animation is well-done and the choice of colors in the scene when Carl looks at the Adventure Book of Ellie is so clever and subtle, it completely matches with his emotions through the scene.

589,13 December 2009,Vishal_s_kumar,10," A must see, brilliantly told tale....","I'm unashamed to admit that Up wrecked me. It didn't earn a stalwart man-tear. It didn't make my lip quiver. It didn't even assault me with the usual warm-n-fuzzies. No, dear readers, it absolutely wrecked me. It's not often that I'm reduced to a pile of thirtysomething tears and sobering sniffles, but Pixar mainstays Pete Docter and Bob Peterson created such a touching tale, such a rousing adventure, such a gorgeous masterpiece that I was completely enraptured by everything that graced the screen. From an early, heart-wrenching glimpse into an old man's dashed hopes and hardened heart to his eventual embrace of something far greater than he ever imagined, Up is as much an emotional experience as an entertaining one; as much a multi-layered character study as a rewarding animated journey; as much a stirring story of love and loss as a thoughtful, nuanced examination of friendship and devotion. Before I exhaust all the glowing adjectives in my vocabulary, I suppose it's best to start at the beginning. After earning critical and box office success with the help of several unlikely animated heroes -- a box of aging toys, a bumbling ant, a pair of closet-haunting monsters, a neurotic fish, a family of outlawed crime fighters, a cocky race car, and a cooking rat -- Pixar proudly introduces Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner), a bitter widower who decides to relocate his house to a remote South American locale using tens of thousands of helium balloons. His motivation? A decades-old promise he made to his late wife, Ellie (Elie Docter), when they first fell in love. Of course, things don't quite go according to plan. Carl finds a young Wilderness Explorer named Russell (Jordan Nagai) stuck on his now-soaring front porch, inadvertently flies into a storm, lands short of his intended destination, and meets an elderly recluse named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) who just so happens to be his childhood role model. But before he has the chance to get his bearings, Carl finds himself at odds with the arrogant explorer, building a genuine relationship with Russell, and rediscovering the man his wife always knew him to be.",

Lucklly some children will not be able to figure this all out for themselves. But if they are like my son, they will be asking you questions all the way home.

It's almost unfair to compare recent kid's films such as Kung Fu Panda or Shrek - both of them decent movies in their own right - to the likes of Finding Nemo or The Incredibles, movies that put to shame anything being produced by rival studios. Then of course, last year, we saw WALL-E, a quantum leap forward from what was already a splenderously high level of standards. That film made me and many others reevaluate what a modern children's film could be, and left us wondering if Pixar would ever be able to replicate that level of success. Up is the film that proves not only that they can replicate that success, but better it. It is a film that blends the best parts of all of Pixar's previous films, and yet somehow manages to be utterly unique, and utterly wonderful.

The movie actually has a lot of material that will keep younger audience more than satisfied, ""Up"" will very much appeal to older viewers. This project is very dynamic, and has really a lot going on in it, but at no time does it lose control or dynamic. The movie was fantastically organized and designed, and definitely everything happens in proper timing.

It is beautiful and horrid to experience. It shapes us in many fashions as we experience every moment, learning more and more about ourselves. Whatever goals we have in life are part of the self-developing construct that helps us better in choosing whichever direction that intrigues us. This adventure is wondrous in its mystery and just as frightening in the same respect that in the end of this journey there is death. What follows after, who's to say? Modeling their love for exploring after famous explorer Charles F. Muntz (Plummer), Carl Fredericksen (Asher) and his wife Ellie (Docter) have looked at the prospect of exploring with the same charisma of their idle, believing in simply the journey. Their hope to reach a place known as Paradise Falls has been their one and only dream in life. Sadly because of the many pressures life brings forth, dreams are often left on a shelf for many years before they can be opened and fully realized. Not long after a poetically musical montage of introduction, Ellie passes on to hopefully a better place, leaving Carl alone, and with little spirit left to move forward. The story picks up later with Carl, a little more cynical and bitter, with his house blocking a construction site. After a misunderstood accident with a worker, Carl is forced into a retirement home. Gratefully though, as many senior citizens are encouraged to by yours truly, Carl refutes such a notion of indifferent hospitality, as he turns his home into a makeshift airship, embarking towards Paradise Falls, in the hope for just one more adventure, for his sake and Ellie's.",

""Wall-E"" may have wowed some adult critics, but I noticed that it did not hold the attention of actual children in an actual theater. Sadly the same is true for ""Up"" even though it has a more childlike storyline. Too many disparate elements -- a house powered by balloons, hordes of talking dogs, a big bird and a giant dirigible? OK, whatever. This is one of the weirdest movies I've seen lately but it's a shame the screenplay is a sort of rehash of aspects of previous Pixar movies. The tearjerking dialogue-free story of loss? We already saw that in TOY STORY 2. Long stretches of no dialogue or limited dialogue? WALL-E. I got the feeling that this movie was just ""Let's do a movie about a house powered by balloons!"" and they just threw a lot of other stuff at it.

Carl meets Ellie (Elie Doctor) and instantly become friends. Eventually Carl grows up and marries Ellie. They promise each other that they will travel together to Paradise Falls and live there. After attempting to save up but always having an emergency, Carl and Ellie continually take from their savings and are unable to go.
Ellie eventually dies and Carl refuses to move from their home despite an offer from the owner of a construction company. When Carl accidentally hits a worker with his cane, he is forced to move to a retirement home. However, he refuses to leave Ellie (the house) and uses helium balloons to lift his house out the ground and keep his promise of taking Ellie to Paradise Falls.
The theme of the movie UP I believe is to be relationships and the focus of this is the Character. Ever since Ellie died Carl has just been mourning and in depression. He is mean to others and has not had any other relationship. Even though he wanted to be alone and just let it be him and Ellie on his way to Paradise Falls, Russell (Jordan Nagai) a boy scout who just happen to be under the porch as the house took off got stuck with him making this bond inevitable.
The setting of the film shows how the characters developed and shares its importance to the film. When Ellie dies this changes Carl to become Bitter to the world. Places him in a position of being the old lonely man who is mean. The house becomes cold and is just a room full of memories for Carl.

However, this great setup was quickly turned over by countless ideas that were not appealing at all. I may have laughed only once in the entire movie as the humor could only be funny to small children. It saddens me that this movie could have been great but I was clearly the wrong target audience.",

Everything about it is so well done. The 2 main voices are excellent. I've never even heard of the guy who plays Mr. Fredrickson's voice. I've seriously never heard of him before, and now I need to check more of his work out, because his voice was spot on! I know of Christopher Plummer. Another excellent choice! The plot is about a kid named Fredrickson who wants to be an explorer and along the way he meets a girl named Ellie, who also wants to be an explorer. They both got married and spent their whole life together! In the end she passed away and Mr. Fredrickson is now an old man and he is lonely and just downright depressed. When the retirement village are ready to take him away he takes off with his house with flying balloons hoisting him into the air! Along the way Mr. Fredrickson meets a very annoying kid named Russel. They are now in Paradise Falls and they encounter talking dogs! But how? When? And who do they belong to and what do the dogs want with them? Excellent, funny, cute and very sad and heartbreaking movie! I recommend it to anyone of all ages! 10/10!",

Carl becoming more of a friend/father to Russell is just so satisfying as they both find happiness despite all the rough times in their lives they've experienced. The scrapbook scene near the end made me cry. And I never cry! Seeing the twist that Carl felt guilty of not keeping his promise of taking Ellie to the falls with him and realizing that their adventure was just spending life with Carl.

And I was kind of right. I think kids can enjoy this movie, but adults too, and maybe even more than kids. I love all the metaphors (House represents what Ellie is for Carl), the music and the animation (even though I sometimes feel like they didn't nailed the balloons). In general, the first half was like a 4,5/5, truly brilliant. But the second half, I thought didn't gave that brilliance of the first half. It felt so fast, kind of messy and the action didn't worked for me. And the fact that Muntz dies, makes Carl kind of the bad one, like he doesn't care about that death, it doesn't even bothers him. Anyway, that half doesn't makes the movie a bad one. Its an 3,5/5 half. Still deep, great message (I would summarize like this: Love is amazing but you still have to do your own thing.

But other than that the movie fails to convince me that it is the best out there. there is a very common thread that is running through both Wall-E and Up...Loneliness. The main character in both the films are undergoing severe loneliness and it is heart-breaking to watch it. My heart went out for Ed at times. But after sometime I got depressed and that is when I thought about Wall-E. It was the same thing I felt in that movie. There is a limit to how much Isolation I can handle :). Other than that the movie was a visual breeze. The animation was far too good and I felt as if I was in heaven while watching some scenes. The bird in the movie was fantastic. I just hope for the next Pixar movie there will be no isolation themes.,
644,10 March 2010,east-emerald,9, The animated movie continues its evolution,"I found some things to poke fun at in ""Up"" ,but I'll start out though with a little gushing praise. Pixar has produced a complex story that blends heartfelt sincerity with the illogic and humor available in animation. I won't bore you with a plot description because I imagine everyone is familiar with the story of Carl Frederickson and his improbable journey to Paradise Falls. In a sequence completely absent of dialogue (think Wall-E) we are shown the complete life of a marriage that includes a miscarriage and the eventual death of Carl's wife, Ellie. This portion alone could have been an amazing short film. Once Carl has teamed up with the ever helpful Wilderness Scout, Russell, we are treated to a more conventional Pixar with the happy ending right around the corner.",

The famous opening is lush and emotional and provides a strong backbone for the adventure that follows. Seen as an ""unfinished love story"" and coming-of-age movie, UP reminds us of the kid in all of us, and it will make you laugh and cry and laugh again (and cry again), all in thanks to the terrific director, Pete Doctor, and the wild and transcendent screenplay by Doctor and Bob Peterson.

659,1 June 2009,jonnygs,10, Up,"Peter Docter's UP is an animated film only in the most basic sense, for it is like no other animated film ever made; it is equal parts action, adventure, drama and comedy. The film combines all these elements so successfully that you will put aside your preconceived notion that animation is for children's films. You know, silly films with uncomplicated plots and G- rated adventure. UP is about an old man, Carl Fredricksen, who dreamed of going to Paradise Falls like his hero, the famous adventurer, Charles Muntz. He promised his wife, who he met as a child and who shared the same dream of adventure, that together they would move to and live in Paradise Falls. But life, and all its problems got in the way, and Carl and his wife never take said adventure. After she dies and Carl accidentally injures a man working on the construction that is occurring next to his home, Carl is forced by a court to give up his house and move into a retirement center. Instead, he attached thousands of balloons to his house and flies away. The characters are hardly stereotypical heroes: an old man, a talking dog, and an overweight Asian boy scout who just want his last merit badge. These characters are believable and they make the film feel realistic. UP features great visuals and stunning color sequences. It is beautifully directed, with shots of great beauty and scope. Docter uses the visuals as his main tool of communication, for example, explaining Carl's life story without any dialogue, and it is obvious that he took great care in framing the characters within the shot. As a result, the film feels authentic and engrossing. The emotional elements of the story are heart-wrenching and make the audience feel a part of Carl's journey. This is also an adventure story where people and indeed their animal accomplices do perish, granted all of this is implied without any details. There are many suspenseful turns in this film and it keeps you on your seat and interested throughout. The mood is constantly being lightened by numerous comedic moments. The dog that follows them on their journey, Doug, whose collar allows him to talk, fills the film with much laughter, as well as being an involved character in the story. The film manages to strike the right note at every turn and is a joy to experience. UP is quite simply a lot of fun and is a comedic adventure that will appeal to all audiences. UP is the best film of the year so far, and is worth any ticket price.",

Everything you see in the trailer is pretty much present as you would expect, but the problem is that other than the masterful introductory fifteen minutes or so, nothing is there to surprise you or make you feel 'blown away'. The action scenes were fun but they somehow stole from the feel. To quote quite the unlikely source for such a phenomenal line... ""It's the boring stuff I remember the most."" That could not be more appropriate to describe Up, as it was the small, slower-paced scenes in the film that really made it stand out in the moments where it did feel special. When the child speaks of his father, and especially any moment referring to the old man and his beloved wife... these story elements that really focus on the characters is what won the show for me. Sadly, that is constantly broken to a degree by another scene that, despite its epic-scale in adventurous action, strangely felt unwanted when I'd rather just listen to the characters talk.

The main character was boring and not funny. Ill give it one thing: the plot line was mature, but is that good for a kids movie? Do you want kids to see a pack of snarling red-eyed dogs coming at them in 3D? I expected a good movie like Toy Story. Toy Story had good characters, a good villain, and a good plot line.

But it lacks that emotional content what this sort of a film requires and it aspires that too. The starting scenes are pure gold. The story runs fast and rapidly to its meat from the very first scene itself. Mr. Fredrickson is a character of great man-hood. But leaving aside him and Russell, this film doesnt provide any other memorable characters which Toy Story does pretty consistently. The humor is good but inconsistent. There are some sequences that will hold your breath but they are far and in between, the film feels unmistakebly long and strecthed though its lenght is just above 93 minutes. The love story is great,begins well and the idea of making this story in animation deserves a apllaud. Then surviving dreams come true altogether, it feels unmistakbly contrived. It could have been more effective. What good is the idea of creating a villain who is your very own childhood hero. The idea was pretty cool but the effect is missing somehow. As i said the animation is good. Kids will enjoy this movie and so do adults, its your choice you decide wether its your cup of tea ! But i have seen better stuff by pixar my favourite being toy story. As i said the animation is first rate and the storyline is unique. A give it a shot kind. I'm going with 5 out of 10.",

The characters in this are perfect even if it is a small character like Ellie or big character like Carl everybody gets so much development even Charles Muntz the villain of the film is also given development, even more than some superhero films nowadays. Also this film has comedy some Pixar films now just want to make you cry but in the 2000s they had mix of sad and funny moments. So overall this film is as close to perfect as an animated film can get, it is has a mix of emotions it is funny and sad when it needs to be it has so much heart and the characters are perfect.

Pixar created a masterpiece of art, they created the definition of cinematic magic. Never has there been a more enchanting, a more fascinating, a more spellbinding animated feature than Up. As i said this is not animation, it is something much more special. Up feels like a Newbery or Carnegie medal winning children's book that comes alive and captures the imagination and soul but this time instead of doing so with text it happens to do so on the silver screen. It feels more like these timeless, enduring and unfading works of pure literary imagination than just being a movie. Movies pale in comparison to Up. Yes i am comparing this film to award winning, timeless, generation spanning and magical literature because comparing Up to other films would be a far more severe insult than calling it an animated film. Up has the magical enchantment only found in books. Up takes all these great qualities that only books have to an even more extraordinary level. Do you want to know what that is? Pure unadulterated emotion. Emotion so profound and philosophical, so startling and deep. Emotion like nothing i have ever seen in animated films nor in almost all of the live action fare that has ever been created for that matter. The humanity in Up slays me.

694,2 April 2010,Lifexinxrewind,6, Pixar takes forced sentimentality to new heights,"As with Wall-E, I couldn't help but feel less than enthusiastic while viewing UP. It's a well put together package, of course, but rarely have I felt that the emotional responses the film makers were going for were so forced. Many of the bits were amusing, and many came off as trite and trying way too hard to inject some humor or cuteness into the proceedings. For a viewer such as me, simply parading cute looking characters on the screen is not enough to warrant the masterpiece status that Pixar seems to get with each film. That being said, the film was beautiful to look at, no argument here. It had some moments that truly clicked, such as the opening montage. In fact, as predictable as the movie's story arc was, the first third of UP was enjoyable.The one thing that really did bother me during my viewing was that I consistently had to say to myself ""it's only a kids movie."" Which is fine and all, but should a movie with such mainstream and critical acceptance really need this sort of free pass to be considered great? It seemed a scene couldn't go by without a major continuity error (by the way, WHY ARE THERE CONTINUITY ERRRORS IN AN ANIMATED MOVIE) or some new level of ridiculousness that betrayed the previous set rules of the film's universe. It was as if I was playing a kids game where the rules keep changing. I expected the overbearing sentimental themes seen in the beginning and end, but between the physics involved in an old man pulling a hose along by a garden hose and the whole ridiculous talking dog storyline it eventually came to a breaking point. There are ways to show sentimentality in a way that doesn't obviously manipulate the viewer, and pointing this out doesn't mean I don't enjoy an emotional story arc. Give me Finding Nemo or Monsters Inc any day over a film like this, which seemingly exists for those that need inspiration to be beat over their head repeatedly for 90 minutes.",

But branded by the name Pixar, I saw the movie and as much as I love Wall E, Up is not only my favorite Pixar film, but one of the best films I've ever seen in a while. This is how animated films suppose to be, I never really fancy Coraline and I like Monsters vs Aliens but that movie doesn't have as much heart as Up. From the start of this film I was emotionally captivated by the main character and even being an grumpy old man, he's still likable and that's one of the reasons I didn't want to see the film in the first place, because the star is an old guy. But don't think for once that the movie is just too emotional, it is also funny, Oh look another movie with talking animals, we got like about three movies like that in 2008, but Up has a talking dog (name Dug) like no other we've ever seen before, Its actually a very genius way of having a talking dog and I would imagine that's how a dog would talk in his mind and Dug's facial expression just makes you go awe and is funny at the same time. Listen people I know you all are looking forward for big blockbusters out now and later soon like Transformers and Harry Potter, but if you can't wait that long go and see Up, you will laugh, even some may cry and enjoy this great adventure movie that I thought before ""A house floating with balloons, LAME"",trust me you haven't seen anything yet and mark my words it will win for best animated film for 2010 Oscars.",

This sequence in particular was reminiscent of the dialog-free sections of Wall-E which deliver their plot punches without exposition or the need for endless sequences that would take twice as long in live action. But this approach doesn't leave the younger audience behind either, and for such a dark start, all I could see in the audience were kids and adults alike glued to the screen. I won't give away any more plot details since the film doesn't open for another three weeks, but every scene and character trait is meticulously plotted so that nothing seems too ridiculous or contrived, even for such a fantastic journey. The graphic stylization is also fresh, in the same way that The Incredibles had a very distinct and authentic look. All of this serves to heighten the humor and there are some extremely funny scenes, helped by the way the characters are quickly and believably established (even the talking dogs, but you'll see what I mean).",

Ever since we were kids, we loved their movies. This year however, Pixar may have made their best movie ever. Let me just say that this is all opinion and no fact and the only fact that may appear is a event from the film. --------------------SPOILER LINE--------------- The main characters of this film are Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) and Russell (Jordan Nagai). These two characters are funny and although this is a kid's movie, the kids will still love Carl. They'll probably relate to them like their grandfather or something. The main villain is Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). Charles is Carl and his wife, Ellie's inspiration. But since Russell's mouth slips and tells Charles about the rare bird specie he's looking for, he now tries to kill Carl and Russell (harsh for a Disney Movie) and get the bird. He even burns Carl's house, THAT FRICKIN *******! The supporting characters are basically Dug, Kevin, and Alpha. I dislike dogs but you gotta love Dug! He's so cute and SQUIRELL! Kevin is also funny but not quite as Dug. And Alpha, no----ot so much. There's action in here ( a little) and it's can have you laughing (or crying) all the way through. Now the story is simple enoug... oh wait, it could be complicated. Carl gets married to Ellie and they want to travel to Paradise Falls but Ellie dies before they can. Carl now tries to fulfill his promise to Ellie and he ties balloons to his house and flies to Paradise Falls. But Russell sneaks on his porch and they land in South America.

It's a Pixar creation with disappointment, loneliness, regret, personal reconciliation and crushed ambition, but that's not what makes UP transcend entertainment to artistry--from child's play to vivid, mature reverie. In this movie, characters do let down others, get let down, die and spill blood. They cry, they lose hope, realtions are disintegrated, passions and goals unfulfilled.

It speaks with so many messages I agree with.. and in such a non message-driven way: this is like hearing a story a true hero, while yourself finding more than one way to connect with their plight. There is a message to feel good sharing with your parents; adventure NEVER ever stops, and loving someone (your chosen beloved for life) is about wishing that their adventure is never ending... There are things we miss out on automating our lives... and reaching too hard for the future or clinging to needily to the past - both things can prevent us from living the moment.

The movie continues with Carl finding a way to finish what he and his wife started, but in the process finds a kid that wants to help him. The movie has a similar feel to that of Its A Wonderful Life, there's a man that's hit rock bottom and a random innocent person wants to help him. However, this takes a different turn where he goes on an adventure and Carl realizes that his memories are where Ellie (his dead wife) is stored, not in the stuff. The movie has everything.

Their marriage is shown to be an adorable one and they have been through the trials of realizing she is infertile. The subject matter while not inappropriate for younger children to see may be a bit over children's heads.

Certain scenes in the film I can call art, yes the film is a work of art, mainly because this film excludes the rule dictated by many, that the films of today cannot be better than the classics of old, the history of film, the touch of love, together with its special effects and animation makes it good enough to be among the list of the ancients.
The colors and details form a bold, moderate and clear, stunning descriptive art. Some scenes when paused could simply become a large portrait or even a large painting by a famous artist hanging in a renowned museum. The images are admirable, especially when the film focuses on the super sharp characters that transmit feelings in abundance across the face, or when it focuses on the high definition of the exuberant nature.
The film is a judicious mix of combinations of feelings, such as, adventure, fantasy, comedy, suspense, romance, drama and others. The film is so acceptable that it could be a film for adults, where the big ones would love more than their children, in short, everyone would be gaping regardless of their ages.

763,8 February 2013,sam-moore82,9, One of my favourite movies of all time,"First lets say I am NOT a massive fan of Pixar movies. Sure, I've had my fair share of them, but it's not really a genre i'm overly fussed about. They were nothing more than fun entertainment made for all the family to watch and enjoy. Enter Up, a tale about a grumpy old man who, after a lifetime of misery and misfortune, goes on an adventure to the land he always dreamed of going to, bringing his house with him. The house isn't the only thing he brings with him, however, and he finds a small child named Russel tagging along for the journey too. What makes Up so interesting is the way it isn't just a typical run of the mill Pixar-type film. It's got all the elements of a comedy that you would expect already (with characters such as Russel adding a sense of light and happiness to the tale and a nice contrast to the more secluded and lonely character of Carl, and talking dogs bringing a relatable and goofy humour that keeps things moving) but the tale also stretches to be emotionally engaging. Carl's story is an emotional one and you really feel sorry for his character from very early on in the story. The first 10 minutes will make you cry (no joke) simply because it's such a relatable and down to earth issue yet effects his character in such a great way that really makes you understand why he is how he is. Towards the end of the movie you really do feel connected to his character and really want him to finally get the happiness he deserves. That's something that movies of ALL genres fail to pull off on a regular basis. The progression of the story is a little hit and miss, and elements such as a bad guy don't feel well placed or even necessary at all, but it does its job of continuing the story, mainly down to the great voice acting and writing, along with some real toung-in-cheek references to movie classics (Independence day fans will get what I mean) Whilst the movie could have been shorter, and a few scenes were a little pointless, by the end you really feel satisfied you were watching a well made and full movie. People of all ages can enjoy this movie. One of the best movies I have ever watched, and certainly the most solid from an emotional standpoint. I highly recommend this, whatever your age or movie tastes, for anyone to watch and enjoy.",

Carl Fredricksen, the 78 year old (or in this case young) balloon vendor turns out to be the surprising hero of the act, where, among other things, he saves himself from all the things that were pulling him down because of the recent events in his life.

Ellie passes away, leaving Carl alone in a world that seems to be moving on without him.

When he arrives he meets his childhood hero, who turns out to be not at all what Carl expected. In the end Carl realizes his dream was really companionship and his life is enriched by the new friends he made while on his adventure. The story, overall, is uplifting, funny and just a good time.

Of course the ending is happy because the ending has to be happy, but to put it bluntly, Up is the first Disney or Pixar movie that made me cry. Its 3-dimensional characters are some of the best characters I've seen, its plot is adventurous yet at the same time believable and its soundtrack is pretty darn good too.

801,6 February 2011,rochelle123,7," I found the film ""Up"" to be funny and chalked full of excitement . It was a great movie to watch with my children.","The movie ""Up"" is a 2009 Walt Disney film about a retired balloon salesman, Carl Fredrickson who is in his 70's living his deceased wife Ellie's childhood dream of adventure to South America. Carl is a funny little man who adored his life with his wife Ellie who he met as a child. After Ellie's death and the court's decision to send Carl to a retirement home, he decides to fulfill Ellie's dream of living on Paradise Falls in South America. Carl fills thousands of balloons with helium and ties them to his house in order to take the house to Paradise Falls. Along the way he realizes that he has another passenger, an eight year old wilderness explorer named Russell. This unlikely duo get off to a rocky start but through meeting new friends like Kevin the bird and Dug the dog they become like father and son. The theme of this film is about life, love, and adventure. In the beginning we see Carl and Ellie's life together up until her death when they are old. We also see the love that they shared. Throughout the rest of the film we see the adventure that Carl takes to live the adventure that Ellie had wanted herself. Towards the end of the film when Carl sits down and looks through the adventure book one last time he realized that Ellie had lived an adventure of her own and was happy with their life together. The film as a whole focused on an old man's dream of fulfilling an adventurous past. Each scene of the film offered a bit of imagination and suspense. When Carl finally reaches Paradise Falls with his house he quickly realizes that his adventure is just beginning. After coming in contact with Kevin the bright colored unusual bird and the talking dog dug the pace of the movie picks up to an action based plot. Carl is torn between saving his house and saving Kevin from his childhood hero. The film was bright in its color format and used very deep but brilliant lighting to enhance the characters themselves. The camera gave different angle shots on specific scenes to keep you in suspense. For example, the scene where the dogs were chasing what appeared to be a very large bird. I found this film to be very mature and more of a young adult type than of a children's style of film. I felt that the film gave a sense of sadness and reality.",

Pixar with such films as Wall E, Toy Story, and Monster's Inc have always been about following your dreams... and maybe that is what makes their movies so great! Pixar as long as I can remember has never gotten a bad review and I am still a teenager (they were making films before I was born!) they have brought back the tradition of Walt Disney who made films for children. Not the garbage: Hannah Montana, Zack and Cody, or some of the other stuff they play on Disney Channel these days, which is not for kids, but for people whose brains have been ripped from there heads and replaced by pounds of music, movies, and thoughts that mistreating girls or acting like a prostitute is cool.

I don't think, since WALL.E that is, that film goers have really appreciated the power silent montages can have on them. The first 15 minutes of the film alone deserves an award as it triggers many emotions within. A mans life is condensed with such purity and heart that instantly we are rooting for the character before he has even muttered a word. After this, we are taken on one of the most beautiful adventures ever to be told on film. I will not say to much about it, check it out for yourself! What I'm trying to say is that ''UP'' has so many messages about life, letting go, and making the most of your time whilst on your journey, that one scene in particular makes the film click! For those that have seen it you will know what I mean when ''Carl'' finally lets go of the past and offloads the ''dead wood'' A masterpiece, do yourself a favour and go SEE IT!",

Yes, the movie deals with some very grown-up subjects such as grief, disillusionment and loss. You WILL be crying within the first fifteen minutes - and that's okay. Detractors fail to grasp UP's two-part message: First, you are NEVER too young or too old to follow your dreams and second, life is the greatest adventure off all, whether or not you actually find your dream.",
828,1 January 2010,zunitrail-1,7, Paradise falls...,"I think the main problem with this film, which I found just OK, was that it was made in these times of ours. Probably what made me think so was seeing it on the same day I saw the digitalized version of the 1941 movie ""Mr. Bug Goes to Town."" While I enjoyed Carl's character, it was diluted by the hyperactivity going on around him, and I ended up caring much more about the insect village in New York 1941 than what happened to Carl's house, which he talked to as if it were his wife. The insect village was beautifully colored and animated, had interesting characters and dialog, and a decent plot (not to mention great music). ""Up"" (which is called Old Carl's Flying House here in Japan) did not have the beautiful color of ""Mr. Bug,"" the human characters were so much like ordinary people we all know (yawn), and it overall tested the suspension of belief I hold for all animated films... the superpowers of 78-yr old cane-wielding Carl and his nemesis 98-yr old Muntz, people and animals apparently being magnetically attached to a wildly careening blimp, to name a couple. Most of all, I missed the crispness of color and line I have come to expect from Pixar. A huge drop from WALL-E. Despite all this, I became misty-eyed at the right moments: which is why movies like this kind of scare me. The intended messages were missed, but at least I cried.",
829,21 June 2009,seriousbusiness47,9, Pixar is godly,"Pixar's new film, Up, is just as dazzling and beautiful as the previous films. The opening sequence alone was enough to make me cry, as it just grabbed your emotions and twisted them about and punched them until they bled. In a good way. It also helps you to understand and connect more deeply with the old man, Carl Fredrickson, voiced by Ed Asner. After his wife dies, he accidentally-on-purpose hits some guy in the head with his cane and the courts decide to send him to an old-folks home. He escapes by attaching a zillion balloons to his house and flying away, off to South America to complete he and his wife's dream of living in a previously undiscovered part of the continent. Along the way, they meet Dug, a dog that has a collar that can translate his thoughts into English (supposedly. I'm not entirely sure how it works). It's almost scary how similar he is to the dogs I know. Adults can be satisfied that they won't get bored, nor will their intelligence be insulted. And judging by the reactions I heard in the theatre (way too many, by the way), kids loved it, too. The animation is, as always, beautiful. Not realistic, but if that's what you were expecting, you must not have ever seen a Pixar film. Also, this is the first Pixar movie I've seen where there was any blood at all, but don't worry. This isn't like The Shining, with a wall of blood gushing towards you. It's a bump on the head.",

Doug is a perfect comic relief character and a huge improvement on Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' Steve, a film which came out the same year. But the stark contrast between the full of life boy scout Russell and the old, deteriorating Carl which makes the movie so rewarding. The surprise villain Charles Muntz is also very good.

837,28 April 2012,david-gouldthorpe,10, My favorite Pixar film so far.,"""Up"" was a great triumph for Pixar, and for animated films in general. Any animated film can make the target audience (children) laugh- -add a couple of cheap jokes and the kiddies roll with laughter. But ""Up"" does much more than that. It makes you cry as well. I highly regret that my family and I went to see Disney's farce of ""G-Force"" instead of this in theaters. Don't get me wrong, ""Up"" has plenty of humor as well, but this film goes one step more and plays with your deeper emotions. This film explores the theme of letting go of the past and embracing the future. There's plenty of drama for adults, plenty of fun and action for children. Be cautious of letting very small children watch this, but it should be fine for most kids. By all means, watch this movie. It's a testimony to the power of animation.",
838,24 June 2013,blackbird827,10, The first eight minutes say it all,"The first eight minutes spoke for the entity of this film. Pixar's montage of Ellie and Carl was not only animated really well, but was also one of the best uses of a montage I've seen recently (montages are tricky to use without being really clichéd or annoying or a mix of both). The 8 minute love story is a detailed recant that explains why Carl is so crotchety. Now, lately, Pixar has been in a decline with their ideas, popping out generic mini-animated things and making them talk coded gibberish, but Up was a diamond in the rough. Even if the kid annoys you, or you don't like love, or you hate dogs, the production of Up is one that remains superior to the recent Pixar attempts at grossing box offices. The plot that follows an angst old man, rather than an angst teen (it's a nice break), and his quest to fulfill the dream he and his wife shared flows steadily with the Scrooge technique of softening his heart. With well liked characters, I find that this is really a FAMILY MOVIE. I hardly find all movies ""family"" movies, because it's just not too common at all to find something produced in such a specific manner it fills the cinematographic mediums of all or most age groups. I don't just mean adults and toddlers will like it, but even your moody teenager might crack a half-smile at the movie. No promises. Pixar really did a good job this time.",

In South America, they saved a colorful bird from an explorer, Charles Muntz, who wanted to take the bird to scientists and was searching for it for many years. Carl lost his house in the end but he owned Charles balloon ship and traveled with Russell happily. Carl was the main character in the movie.

Carl was a determined person and carried on their dreams. Though he was very old and his wife had passed away, he took the trip immediately that nobody could imagine. Finally he passed his love on to the little boy. Russell was a little hero in the movie and brave. He desired a real adventure. Facing danger, he still wanted to save his friend. He was really friendly and kind to animals. Charles was an overambitious and cruel person. He decided not to come back to England until he found the bird when he was doubted by the public. He lived in field for many years. At first he was kind to Carl and Russell and invited them to dinner. But when he found the bird was their friend, he wanted to kill them without mercy and catch the bird. He had many dogs. His favorite one was Alpha, who was the same ambitious and cruel as him.

The 3D wasn't that good and the story wasn't as intriguing as the story of a robot that develops human emotion whilst cleaning a desolate, inhabitable Earth landscape. It does have its upsides, though. If it hadn't been for ""Wall-E"", this story would have blown me away.
