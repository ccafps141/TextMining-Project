Most of the ones I've seen were wonderfully entertaining but I am far from an expert on Bollywood. Because of this, I have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. So, consider this when you read this review. This may be among the very best India has to offer or it just seems that way to me.",/
1,20 November 2011,donutpizza,9, Wow this American loves this movie,"I asked my co-workers to recommend a Bollywood movie. I expected ""Dumb and Dumber"" by the title. It wasn't that at all. It is more of an inspirational comedy with some serious but good messages. A more accurate title would have been ""The Legend of Rancho"".",r
2,9 September 2013,Fella_shibby,10, Finally a masterpiece from Bollywood. Aamir Khan is the best thing to happen to Bollywood.,"Awesome film man. Saw this with my family in a theatre. Worth every penny n worth every minute. Never seen such an amazing film from Bollywood.
What is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. The last 30 mins were beautifully shot. Very good direction by Hirani. The star cast is good n Aamir khan steals the show.
The editing is top notch. U don't feel bore for even a sec. Awesome screenplay. It's hands down the best film in the history of Bollywood.",e

4,2 October 2020,Xstal,9, Hat-Trick Heroes x 3...,"Like Dead Poets Society but with Robin Williams as a student and some extra tonic and spice thrown in for good measure. Serious, sad and silly, often concurrently but overwhelmingly very, very funny and engaging, as engineering students at an Indian college end up teaching as much as they learn. Who could disagree with the distinction between education and learning while recognising the often sizable gulf that exists between the two after watching this. Who would dissuade those with aspiration and passion from pursuing their dreams and goals. Weighing in not too shy of three hours you'll be shocked how quickly the time flies as your attention is vacuumed up and your view of the world turned on its head, or inverted, depending what you've learned.",i
5,3 August 2021,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,9," Don't be fooled by its name, it's a great movie","The film not only shows the mistakes of the education system, but also reveals how the truth should be. That life is not actually a race; reveals that this is imposed on us by the education system. Rancho, our character who opposes the order at every opportunity, cannot make sense of not talking about new ideas but grades at schools. Because he goes to school to learn, not for a diploma, he gives importance to knowing the meaning, not memorizing, he does not say ""what I learn at school stays at school"", he applies what he learns in daily life. The secret of its success; Reading the part he is passionate about.",e
6,6 February 2016,deloudelouvain,7, One of the better Bollywood movies I saw,"Because the movie had such a high rating on IMDb I was intrigued. Bollywood movies are not particularly on the top of my list I must admit. But I gave it a shot and I'm glad I did. It only has two scenes where they start singing and dancing so that was not too much. Why they start singing and dancing that I will never get. The story does not need that at all. The story itself was very pleasant to follow. Full of mixed emotions, happy ones and sad ones. The cast and the filming was great. All actors gave a good performance throughout the whole movie. Like in most American television series they want to give you a lesson in life and most of the time it makes me want to barf but in this Bollywood movie it works perfectly well. I had fun watching this and I get why I am not the only one. Certainly worth a watch.",w

10,26 September 2020,MOscarbradley,10, If this had come from Hollywood and not Bollywood it might have cleaned up at the Oscars.,"The title may conjur up images of the 3 Stooges and the crude humour of the opening might suggest a Hindi ""Porky's"" but with a running time of almost three hours ""3 Idiots"" clearly has its mind on higher things. It's a Bollywood buddy-movie devised as an epic and determined to outdo all the competition and being a Bollywood movie is full of large-scale musical numbers as well as a lot of very broad and very funny comedy.",6
11,24 December 2009,sumanbarthakursmailbox,10, 3 idiots is a masterpiece and easily one of the greatest Bollywood movies of all time,"I saw the paid premiere of 3 idiots today.On the whole, 3 idiots is a winner all the way everythingwise.3 idiots suits the term 'landmark cinema' and has all it takes to help Bollywood take a giant step into world cinema with pride.3 idiots is a sparkling example of qualitative cinema.3 idiots not only entertains, it also enlightens.3 idiots is forward-thinking, but also makes you recall your roots. It promises lots of laughs and also a heartwarming message.There are movies aplenty, but very few remain etched in your memory and possess recall value. 3 idiots is one of those films. Indisputably and undeniably, this Aamir-Madhavan-Sharman outing is worth the price of the ticket and more.The film will set new records and has the merits to emerge one of the biggest hits of all times. The weekend business should be historic, the Week 1 business should be unparalleled, the lifetime gross should be amongst the biggest of all times. In short, 3 idiots has 'Blockbuster' written all over it.The story of 3 idiots has been told differently and most importantly, the story offers so many twists-n-turns that you just can't guess what would unfold next.There's so much happening in every scene and the screenplay is so gripping that you don't feel the need to look at the auditorium ceiling or at your watch at brief intervals. You aren't restless. 3 idiots demonstrates how strong film-making can enhance and elevate an already solid concept.An Aamir Khan film is nothing short of an event. The supremely talented actor acts in one film a year and no two films are ever identical in terms of plot line.To sum up, 3 idiots is commercial Hindi cinema at its best. The film has 'Hit' written all over it. Let me put it this way: Cancel whatever you're doing today and go watch 3 idiots instead.Director Rajkumar Hirani strikes a fine balance between humor and emotions. The comic portions are executed with panache, the drama is attention-grabbing and the emotional quotient is strong enough to turn you moist-eyed. The marriage of humor and emotions as also technique and content is what drives 3 idiots to the winning post.",7

15,2 November 2017,classicsoncall,9," ""Aal izz well"".",Never would I have thought that a movie that looked this stupid on paper could have turned out so good. Just looking at the DVD cover would have been enough to turn this film back in but it shows up in IMDb's Top #250 so I thought I'd give it a try. It didn't start out that well for me but before long the movie's magic began to take hold. Not that there's anything daringly new about it's message; it all has to do with believing in one's self and doing what you really want to do with your life after one's formal education is completed.,5

I have definitely watched over 600 movies in my life, and this happens to be the only movie which was able to have a positive impact in my life. Long story short, I have been in the place of each of Rancho, Fahran and Raju in my life. And I have always applied the principles this movie introduced whenever I have been in a tough situation. I have learned to follow after excellence rather than success. I have learned to follow my passion and care less about what society thinks about my decision.",r
20,15 January 2012,ahmedn32004,10, The best Indian movie ever,"To be brief, THIS IS THE BEST Indian MOVIE EVER CREATED..... I know it is old but I just heard about it recently so I watched it yesterday. I think this movie should be one of the best 250 films in history on IMDb rating. I rated it 10/10 and believe me it worth more than this. I don't want to make spoilers in my review so that you will enjoy every minute of the movie. This movie is 2:44 hours length full of laughter, joy, tears, drama and passion. And of course, the most interesting part of the movie is GENIALITY. I loved every moment of this movie. and I hope to watch a lot of future Indian movies like this. I'm also waiting for Ferrari Ki sawari movie to watch. It is starred by one of the 3 idiots. ",e

If anything, I'll take that as a compliment, as the film is about self-actualization, or the simple fact that it's a wake up call in this rat race of a world that we live in, that we lose sight of things that matter in the pursuit of success. It's a wake up call that we should be pursuing Excellence instead, which in the work environment one gets easily drowned in mediocrity, or blind faith that success follows without putting in too much hard work.",f
22,11 August 2015,ironhorse_iv,8, All is kinda well for 3 idiots. It was mostly a great feel-good movie.,"In a country, where over-achievement is expected & anything deem a normal life is look upon as the idiotic or lazy failure. A lot of Asians feel, that slaving away, their lives, for the chance of extraordinary wealth is the only way, to live, even if it's does not suite their personality. Indeed, the hunger for success and wealth is so engrained in Asian culture, that it's hard to escape, such burdens. It's true, that Asians societies, do put extreme pressure on its members. Often, weighting down on them to a point, that some people feel, that it's too much; causing them to common suicide. So, I can see, why people would want to see this film directed by Rajkumar Hirani. It has a more healthy and positive approach when it comes to a country's wants and don't wants, when it comes to the individual member. Set in an India academia world, 3 Idiots revolves around three students studying in the Imperial College of Engineering, in New Delhi. The first idiot, Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) comes from a poor family and is desperate to pass and get a good job, but lacks the self-esteem to go with his plans. The second idiot, Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), comes from a relatively better family, but has joined engineering to please his family, while he really wants to become a wildlife photographer. The last idiot, Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchhad (Aamir Khan) is a radical-thinking young man, who more willing to challenges the educational system at every step he takes, rather than accenting the harsh-crude teaching practices of the college, often infuriating the headmaster of the school, Viru 'The Virus' Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani). However, Farhan and Raju lost contact with Rancho after graduation. Ten years later, Farhan gets a call from an old enemy colleague of theirs, Chature 'Silencer' Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya) who says he has found Rancho. Abandoning everything, Chatur, Farhan and Raju set out on a road trip, to find him. But all is not as it seems. Can the idiots find their friend or will the search end up as a wild goose chase? Watch the movie, to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to look at the film, in a western world view set and say, the Animal House style college scenes, far out-live the present day, road trip movie. I really felt, those scenes were far, more effective, even if the social message was somewhat too broad. I like that, the modern day teaching standards are called into question. It made a very interesting film. Sadly, the movie takes the often funny yet brilliant Patch Adam like, school challenges, and mixed it, with below average Bollywood film dramatics. The movie often moves into such clichés, that it become somewhat emotional jarring to watch. One minute, you're listening to a Bollywood musical dance number, and then, you cut to an emotional, over the top preachy death scene. The pacing for the film is all over the place. It really drags at times. Some of the film's greatest twist comes inappropriate mistimed. You'd know that Raju will survive his suicide attempt since he's alive and well in the present day scenes. You know, that the men will end up, being successful, regardless, what the Virus pull onto them. Don't get me wrong, the twist about Racho's past was pretty good, but the film was pretty predictable. Then, there are the unrealistic over the top scenes that are absolutely nearly implausible in any universe, like the whole stubborn baby scene. Anyways, the acting, throughout the film was pretty good. Each character had a moment to shine. My only problem with the acting is Kareen Kapoor as Pia. She was so disappointing, most of the film. I really don't get her character. Why would she still go after, Suhas (Olivier Lafont), after three-times, where characters warn her, not to!? It doesn't make sense. Plus, that noise ring, she wore, during the film was so distracting. Another thing that kinda hurts the film is the songs. Shantanu Moitra's score is a bit too gimmicky. The song, Zoobi Doobi sounds entertaining, but sounds too similar to other Bollywood songs. The song 'All Izz Well' sounds like it should had been, put in the credits than in the middle of the film. Anyways, I love the over-the-top childish humor. While, the jokes are simple and old. They work mostly within the means of the story. Chatur's engineered speech is by far, the funniest scene in the film. Still, the movie does seem, a bit, one-sided when it comes to condone misbehavior. I'm deeply surprise that the three men, wasn't kick out of the school, within the first couple of minutes in the film. Much of the film's controversy, comes from the fact, that the movie is loosely based on the novel, Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhaget. Any fan of the book, would know, that the film is way different. The suicide message of the book, get somewhat lose in the film. Yes, within the last five years, India has one of the greatest absolute numbers of suicides cases, but here is where the movie get some of the information, wrong. Other countries have the highest rates, overall. It's also untrue, that extreme pressures of academia cause most of India's suicide rates. Farmers are more likely to kill themselves, versus any other professions in India, as list by the World Health Organization. Despite that, the film is fun for the most part. The film is distinctive for featuring real inventions by little-known people. The cinematography is beautiful to look at. I love the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh. The film felt like a typical masala film. It's good to eat, but a bit too spicy, at same moments. No wonder, why this film is one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films ever. Overall: While it's kinda overrated. It's emotional, entertaining and enlightening. In my opinion, it was a somewhat above averaged Bollywood film.",_

Why would a movie with such a bad title be voted so highly? I went in thinking this would be India's version of Animal House or American Pie. But after watching the film, I was in love! It is so much more than the usual college story of young guys getting drunk, flunking classes, and getting back at their superiors. It is an extremely well-made film about doing what you love and facing your fears. The acting is incredible by the ensemble cast. The script is funny and poignant at the same time. Even the scenery is breathtaking. Although the length of the film is pretty long and has some quirky musical numbers, 3 Idiots is a delight. It is worth the watch!",t
26,29 June 2013,ctowyi,10, An undeniable masterpiece,"One of my students - a girl, once asked me how would she know if she has found the right guy. I told her I don't know how but I shared with her a method to sieve out the useless ones. Get them to watch 2 films with you and watch for their reactions. If the first reaction is ""I don't watch silly Japanese cartoons and musical Hindi flicks,"" discard them like used tissue papers because they are not worth your time. Why?  Because they already have deep-set perceived ideas and worse of all, they will not even give it a chance, not even for you. Then if they do want to watch them, watch for their reactions. If they give snide and self-important remarks, hello-goodbye them out of your life. The 2 movies that I suggested to her were My Neighbour Totoro and 3 Idiots. ",_
27,10 December 2020,perica-43151,9, Significant and entertaining,"This is a significant Bollywood movie, but for European or American viewers, it is best compared to a binge-watched colorful Hollywood miniseries by style, melodramatic and light in tone, but much more filled with meaning. It celebrates Gypsy style music and ingenuity in poverty while criticizing strict education systems of high Asiatic pressure and parental authority which stifles creativity by senseless rot-learning even at top institutions. Quite entertaining and watchable, and different in style - but not at all inferior in quality - to the top Hollywood production, it has some authentic light humorous touches and some intense melodrama - an over the top Bollywood type soap opera that is somewhat a significant social critique at the same time.",u

You know, eveyone bursts into dance in the middle of the film and the good guys beating up the bad guys with super hero powers. Or the cheese plots of the poor boy marrying the rich girl... Well Hirani's directing totally shifted my views not only on Indian cinema but also helped me understand and appraciate Indian culture. For me it was easy to relate with the struggles of the charecters to face their family's plans for them as well as to survive the rat race that our lives have turned into, in spite of the fact that I have no asian background.

What's even worse, I've run out of American movies to watch since I've basically watched every movie that suits my palate. A friend of mine hugely recommended this Indian movie for me to watch. I was completely reluctant in the beginning to say the least. The title sounds like a Jim-Carrey-parody-like comedy which nothing in it can be literally taken serious.

But 3 idiots is intriguing enough to shatter my bias. Character building is successful enough to make the three idiots, Pia, Virus and even Chatur seems authentic and attractive to me. I love the bright, joyful color of a school comedy that lightens up the mood before the characters even appears. Twists and turns in this movie is so cleverly arranged that the excitement they creates are perfectly maintained by the next. Rancho, the legendary guy, happens to leak his whereabouts when Chatur declares victory over the other 2 idiots, and they happen to seize the opportunity to make the real Rancho spill the shameful truth, and Pia happens to get married at the same day, so they can restore the poetic justice for Rancho/Wangdo and embrace the perfect ending.

Please note I am NOT Indian, but this is (as of yesterday) one of my top five favorite films of all time. My only criticism is the title - it's horribly misleading for American audiences who would probably expect a Judd Apatow nonsense film (and offensive to boot). Not so with this film - the characters are anything but idiots despite their college experiences. Brilliantly written and directed, there's something for everyone here: comedy, tragedy, and even a couple of song and dance numbers (seamlessly integrated). The acting is superb, the plot is a bit complex but fascinating, and it's shot with care and attention. LOVE IT.",

The high expectation was palpable. After all, Aamir Khan has been producing successive hits over the years. Now for the movie - which starts in an engineering college in India, goes on to show the lives of three of its students through the years till they graduate. This being a Bollywood film, obviously has a smattering of romance and song and dance sequences. Right from the start where Aamir jaywalks into the college building without a care in the world to the time he starts questioning the teaching methods in class, its just a matter of a couple of days. Some cheeky guy this is! Unfortunately, all his antics and funny lines are as old as the college building he is in. You would have heard these jokes a hundred times over. Anyways, that is the best part of the film since it at least elicits a few laughs. The rest of the 3 hours is filled with stereotypes and melodramatic scenes which are ridiculous at best. It seems that these days in India, anyone who can make the audience cry can laugh all the way to the bank. Aamir has this knowledge and isn't afraid to use it.",

53,1 October 2011,Peter_Young,5," Fairly idiotic, but it's not that bad","Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots is generally a rather entertaining comedy, but as a film it is only partially successful. Though it does have its moments, it never really manages to completely deliver and lacks the power to enthrall. It mostly works as a senseless comic ride and only occasionally does it convince when it tries to convey a message. The film is quite messy in presentation, and it is a tiresome task to follow the proceedings as every now and then the story moves confusingly between past flashbacks and present developments. The movie is good in many ways, and at times it's very funny, but it is the overall product which is faulty. The dialogue is for the most part excellent, so is the visual style, but then, the script lacks focus. While Hirani's direction is quite smart and creative at times, he often tries to include too many elements, and, as a result, the movie often seems to go nowhere. The humour wavers between witty moments of hilarity and cheap, unoriginal gags. And then we also have poor sequences of overdone melodrama and manipulative sentimentality, which are incorporated rather forcibly into the movie and they really fall flat. The entire birth sequence, for one, is one hell of a cliché. So is the ending, which is sugarcoated to the max. ",
54,25 February 2010,jmathur_swayamprabha,7," Good, not outstanding","3 Idiots is definitely an over-hyped good movie. A lot of expectations were associated with the movie since it was going to come from Raju Hirani, the Munnabhai director and Aamir Khan, the perfectionist actor (and producer and director). Definitely the movie is a good one but it falls short of the pre-release expectations. It is a nice timepass as the entertainment value is quite high. The inherent message for the youth to pursue their passion instead of joining the rat race is also exemplary. However, giving a second look to the movie (after the laughters and the first time euphoria have calmed down), several flaws can be seen very easily in the storyline as well as the treatment. Loosely inspired by the novel Five Point Someone, the movie has shown the lead characters as black or white instead of grey, the real life ones. The director has played with the characters as puppets in his hands instead of allowing them to develop normally. The best example is of Chatur (played excellently by the hitherto less known actor Omi). The movie has exaggerated several things and the biggest drawback of the movie in my opinion is that the storyteller challenges the intelligence of the viewers at several places. There are several incidents in the movie totally indigestible for a sensible viewer. Perhaps Raju Hirani conveniently overlooked the fact that his audience is not the David Dhawan's audience who is expected to leave the brains at home before leaving for the theatre.",

And just to be fair, there are a few entertaining moments, it's professionally produced, and the performances for the most part aren't that bad. Heck, I'll even go so far as to say all the protagonists are pretty good. But good lord, what an awful script. Melodramatic clichés galore, terrible humor (why so many pee and fart jokes?), simplistic messages, a hero who can absolutely do no wrong and villains for whom the phrase ""one-dimensional"" is generous. It's as if someone marathoned through the absolute worst Hollywood has to offer and took notes. The sad scenes are laughable, the comic scenes are painful, and all of it is predictable (except the final little twist, which I admit was kind of a nifty surprise). Much of the film resembles REAL GENIUS, from the unflappable, infallible hero to the evil professor and the suck-up rival. And that's not a movie you want to aspire to. And there's a scene I know I've seen somewhere else before, but I can't place it. Teacher tells student his exam/paper won't be accepted because it's late, student asks if the teacher knows his name, teacher says no, student stuffs paper/exam in the middle of the stack. It'd be a clever bit, if not for this nagging feeling it was lifted from something else. Even the songs aren't that great, although the accompanying spectacle is sometimes charming. In the end, it's the three leads (Aamir Khan, Sharman Joshi and Madhavan) and the romantic interest (Kareena Kapoor) and their endearing performances despite the horrible material that save this from being a complete waste.

There are many instances where students have taken last step as suicide when they can't handle the study pressure. There are people who have inner abilities and skill sets of some other field than the field in which they are currently working or say there are people who trying hard to establish themselves in the field according to their chosen career path but can not make the headway. Actually these kind of people might have realised that they have taken wrong path and that is because of parent's expectation, social status or may be because of peer pressure. There are people who are repenting after making career in the field in which they are not enjoying and have mindset that they would have been done better in some other field. There are parents with the mindset that some educational field are good and some are bad. This is may be because of status in the society, job market and money reward in the field. But by this way they are ignoring inner abilities of their child and take the part in spoiling their career. This is like curing the disease the wrong way by giving wrong drug. This way they are killing their real pleasure.

72,28 December 2009,anudge,7," Good, but they overdid it.","I was eager to watch this movie as the only bollywood films i like are those of aamir khan. When i saw the trailer of the movie, i thought that this movie could be the best of all time in bollywood, but it considerably failed to be. The plot was somewhat interesting , the cast was very appropriate, the acting was superb, the dialogues were wonderful , but the director maybe oozing with overconfidence, tried to put just too much in it. He tried to put it in ALL the good and bad things a teenager should do while he is in college. It was hard to identify the real protagonist in this movie, and even in the end i was left wondering whether raju was the man in the spotlight or aamir. What i hate to watch and hear is a meaningless song with meaningless lyrics and meaningless dance. And thats just what was very prominent in the movie. I don't understand the purpose of such futile non-sense, is it because people like it ? OH REALLY??? or is it because the director finds it attractive? attractive like - cow dung over cake.!? Another flaw i noticed was the change in character of aamir - from when he was a small kid to his teenage years. He looked and behaved like the most innocent one and out-of-all-activities one and later he became the most notorious and daring guy in college. Let the movie be pathetic or super-hit , boman irani was as always at his peak. His character was very well presented and he did just fine enough to make him the funniest as well as the most brutal character in the movie. The movie also had a lot of dramatic, sensitive scenes, at the wrong times, which did at times bring tears in my eyes, and left the other brain-left-at-home audience sob while staring at the screen. I wont say anything about Kareena because there isn't any need to publicize her flaws, there's a need to look for the minimal positivity in her enacting of her cameo. Rest was very appeasing , it was a pleasure to watch nonetheless, and the film was worth watching. 7/10",

It's not even that I can't get into a cinematic whirlwind like this, as other filmmakers in other countries will (sometimes) go for BIG emotions and BIG turns like this one does (Love Exposure was something that came to mind during this, of all things). So if you read what I'm about to say and think I'm full of it or don't know what I'm talking about it, well, the latter may be about right, but I can still share my honest thoughts much as they are.

Moreover, the main content & message proves that surely it was another a very much needed film for the respected audience. And as usually Mr. RH delivered the package very well. But my only little disappointments goes with the final climax. The sequences of final climax are very much important to closing the main statement in a way that stays in the mind of the audience for an adequate amount of time. And that can then help to form a judgmental & thought provoking ideas. For example, MUNNA BHAI MBBS. The whole vacuum baby delivery idea may be new for the viewers with a little demonstration of usefulness of WEB CAM tech. Though I haven't get the chance to read the original novel but personally I think this climax sequence didn't quite fit in a proper way with the content of the story like the climax of MUNNA BHAI films were superbly coped with those stories.

93,4 September 2010,asankabg-1,10, Best Bollywood movie I've ever watched,One thing that comes to our mind when we say Bollywood is fancy stories with dream worlds. They are far for reality and almost nothing to take from it. But this movie stands still as a giant proving that Bollywood isn't all about synthetic dream worlds. This is a classic masterpiece with the combination of geniuses.,

The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the name: 3 idiots is not appropriate, it should have been ""Looking for Rancho"" or ""Al-its-wel"". Another thing was It doesn't explain much about why Rancho ran away from his friends and his love, it never explains why he couldn't express his love. You can sort of figure it out at the end of the movie, but is not that clear.

Some of the messages about suicide, peer pressure, parental expectations and teaching methods were presented quite well, though possibly a bit heavy handedly, and generated some of the genuinely heartfelt moments.

After noticing lots of popularity I was also pulled into the hype. But was disappointed to see another movie like Munnabhai. Same College and Principal and hospital etc. Not fresh story at all. Lots of old jokes. Some sequences are absurd. 3 idiots can take a old patient to Hospital but cannot take a pregnant woman and applies their engineering knowledge to deliver a baby. They can gather the whole college but not a single girl to deliver a baby. Like I said...its a good bollywood masala movie but nothing great. I don't know why some people are surprised about Aaamir's acting as a college boy. His face is still boyish and suits these kind of roles. May I ask in which film he looked like a Man? Arshad Warsi could have done better job in this movie. Now the good things. There were some good dialogues and good acting from Sharman Joshi(Raju) and Omi Vaidya(Ramalingam). This movie is Chatur Ramalingam's. The producers are clever to market the movie like Ghazni and make their money. After few days we audiences will look back and think how they made fool of us. This movie is worth watching only in DVDs.,
124,2 January 2010,sam-pacificmortgagegroup,1, Bland and Boring......,"It is only if I had not lost my movie sensibility, I would have been placed better. The best part about India is that everything has a following and Aamir Khan with his histrionics and verbal spats is in the midst of a great purple patch. Everything he is touching is turning into gold and it takes a modern day genius to do that. He is more like a good salesman then an actor. If you can sell the same college song after 21 years, you sure have to be awarded the best salesman in your industry. Well, the real disappointment is not Aamir, as he frequently makes bad movies...Fana and Ghajini to name just the latest 2 but he also carves out little gems like Taare Zameen Par every now and then. And the disappointment is also not from the fact that he is still playing the college Romeo. The disappointment is with Raj Kumar Hirani who in trying to accommodate Aamir's star power did what Shubhash Ghai did in Yaadein. The Box office verdict has been starkly different for both the movies because young India connects to the message of 3 idiots well. Critics with a few exceptions did not speak their mind because they knew that this movie was going to do colossal business. But the fact remains a fact....the ending was manufactured and seriously pretending. It was like that the script writer was superficially trying to make everybody smile while walking out. It is the first time Hirani has erred and hope that he does not slip again, as he has given 2 most memorable movies in recent memory. This does not even come close. The point of view was excellent, the treatment not.",

It sucked me into a world of comedy, romance, and drama in a way I've never seen used before. It was so unique in the way it was used; it wasn't a typical Hollywood film with every cliché scene being used. I quickly found myself become attached to these ""3 idiots"" through great acting and character development. This movie was stuffed with life lessons and ultimately very enlightening. It was all a slam dunk. a 10 out of 10. However, don't get me wrong. This movie wasn't perfect. There was a few scenes where they would break out into song for about 10 minutes which was a little annoying but I could see how it fit into the movie.

156,14 July 2020,garethcrook,8, 3 hours of joy.,"Looking for a silly comedy? This has you covered. I guess the title suggests an element of farce and it sure delivers. Farhan (R. Madhavan) fakes a heart attack to get off a plane that's just about to leave Delhi, to pick up his mate Raju (Sharman Joshi), after getting a call that their mate Rancho (Aamir Khan) is on his way. We don't know why, but this news creates a lot of excitement. Unnecessarily it seems as Rancho isn't really on his way. Chatur (Omi) has brought them to a meeting at their old college campus, the setting were 10 years earlier, he'd challenged Rancho to a bet to see who'd be the more successful on their return. Fahran and Raju's excitement is because they've not seen Rancho in 5 years, he's disappeared, he's not at the meeting, but Chatur says he knows where he is. First though we'll travel back to how the friends met. At university, where Rancho instantly proves himself a bit of a maverick. He's the smart unconventional one. The others don't know what to make of him, but admire him. He's apparently from a wealthy family, the others far less so. But Rancho sees the world from an idyllic viewpoint, seeing the possibility and promise in everything and everyone. It's all a bit light and fluffy, like a teen movie, just translated from California to India. It's playful, even employing a few Bollywood style dance numbers, which I'll confess I really enjoyed. Blasts of colour, sweeping cameras, beautiful synced choreography, it really is a lot of fun to watch. For all it's joy, it's not scared to hit the darker side too. The school for engineers they study at is highly revered and the pressure immense. From themselves, perhaps their families, certainly the teachers. The tyrannical head of the school, nicknamed Virus, doesn't like them either, especially Rancho. Mainly down to the fact that in Rancho he's found a nemesis. Smarter, younger, much more likeable. Here again it echoes those 80s American high school movies. Virus is Rooney from Ferris Bueller! I'm not laughing hysterically throughout, but it is funny. Rancho is fond of a joke to make his point, that work should be fun. But one such gaff pushes fellow student and teachers pet Chatur over the edge, ridiculing him in front of the whole school. This is what brings us to the fateful scene, where the bet is made that he'll be more successful in 10 years time. This becomes the catalyst for a great twist, one that I'm loathed to spoil. Rancho is an inspiring fellow, but he's much more than what we see on the surface. It's a truly heartwarming story, overly sentimental yes, far too long yes, packed full of cliche yes, but it's so lovely. It's the silliest thing I've watched in ages, but it's infectious and all the characters are wonderful, you're rooting for everyone, not just the 3 Idiots. Even at its nearly 3 hour runtime, it rattles along at a decent pace. A tangle of characters, relationships, timelines and story arcs. It's not ground-breaking, but I'm not sure I've seen anything else quite like it.",

159,20 September 2019,JakeBrinkman,5," Poor first half, but a powerful second half","I've only seen a handful of Indian films so far, but this was the first one that I can call okay instead of bad. It has a really slow start but an emotional second half. I didn't expect to like it based on the beginning. The advertising made it seem like a comedy, when it's actually a coming of age drama, and nearly all of the comedy is extremely immature potty jokes. Plus a lot of Rancho's initial challenges to the establishment (and the entirety of the director's character) seemed childish and/or unrealistic. However, once the story turned serious (about 45-60 minutes into the movie), there were several scenes that had me on the verge of tears in powerfully joyful moments.",

He shows us that both can be possible in a single movie.

164,16 November 2020,Kdosda_Hegen,6, Not all is well.,"This film is a mess. It mixed past with present time to tell a story. They completely ignore the most important questions like why Rancho has not contacted his friends in all these years, also why was Pia going marry ""ass"" again if she was proved that he's not worth it. Basicly this film completely ignores what the characters learned in the past and makes them do same mistakes only for the finale of the film for them to make the right choices again. Also this film likes to show many serious issues of the real world but then the next second it puts a terrible joke, so I could not take this film seriously at all. It's such a mess. It had many great ideas, the storyline is great, but it's just such a mess, it tries to mixes multiple genres at the same time which does not help.",

168,17 January 2023,sandipdeores,10, Masterpiece from Bollywood,"Masterpiece from Bollywood, All is well, as they so often say. Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots, my introduction to the world of Bollywood cinema, is a comedy-drama unlike anyone I've ever seen, long, but never drawn out, frantic, but never desperate, and emotional, but never manipulating. It provides us with three of the most likable characters of the last decade, and with insight to the culture of Indians and their parents. Rarely has a comedy had this big of a brain in its head and a canvas of opportunities in mind, while possessing a title not even fit for a farce. 3 Idiots recite when they become frazzled or nervous, while frantically tapping their hearts. They know that reciting the oversimplifying phrase will not provide their problems with a solution, or even a catalyst, but it gives them the onset courage they desperately need at a time of uncertainty and despair. One character even tries to use the line after an amateurishly-given birth may have gone terribly wrong. It's times like that when the saying may not be so effective, even if its goal is not to provide certain relief.",
169,10 January 2013,karanx22,1, Reality Check for you,"Being an Indian I have seen a lot of Bollywood movies which do not live upto international standards. 3 Idiots is no different. It's a masala movie, which will draw only mainstream and dumb folk. It might be attractive to the viewers outside as such experiences are new to them, however the truth is that this movie doesn't deserve any place in any top lists on IMDb. I'm sure that the people who have given it a 10/10 have never seen any other movie on the top 250 list. It was a major hit in Indian theatres and any rational,logical and a real movie buff can never like this sort of an impractical movie. To be honest, for an Indian movie I'd give it a 6/10 , however on an international scale it would barely get a 5. If you want to watch a good Indian movie, I'd recommend watching Dev.D which I rate as an 8/10; and I feel should be on the top 250 list. Make a wise decision",

This is an inspirational blockbuster movie, full of sentiments, touches upon critical issues like school stress and it carries varying kinds of moments, funny to deep thought-provoking moments with big significant lessons by the virtue of humor and the witty dialogues that keep you engrossed.
Thanks to the splendid Performance by Amir, he owned it indeed, some other acting crew were average and also I think that the duration was too long and I believe it could have been less longer. I noticed that Indian like their films to surpass the two-hours timeframe which might be deemed to be a weakness because you want to keep the viewers awake and you don't want them to yawning, also films suppose to save time or some viewers rather read the book that this movie was based on, you will be moved by the movie and it will absolutely change your mindset after you will have done.",

I guess that many Western people cannot understand what Asian students like me are going through. We have to study all day, I mean, studying is not only a 7 to 5 ""job"" but it also deprive us of our sleep.

It's a Amir Khan movie(assuming the country has a huge Amir Khan fan following). 2. It's supposed to be adapted from one of the India's top selling Author's book. The movie has a very pathetic head start. I never seen a taken off plane landing just because of a stupid Chest Pain I thought Airlines were supposed to have Emergency Trauma Treatment and other First Aid services. Well neglecting that point since it's a bollywood movie its quiet fair. As the movie takes off almost till its mid section you may find certain Kicks but not a perfect comedy material yet. I didn surely notice that movie dictates some social values Even though I could see a good script building up only if the characters could have stood by it. The character of Chatur seems totally illogical, from his acting and presentation point of view it looks total waste of Reel time, I personally didn like it may be some mature actor might have Sufficed for it. Amir is OK as ever not a big deal to his role but had done pretty well till now. On with d latter section of the movie there is quiet a story.

Just because you make posters that look like tarey zameen par, the movie does not become one. You know what is funny?

It couldn't get higger! Loosely based on hlockbuster novel ' Five Point Someone ' hy Chetan Bhagat the movie deals with the present education system in India that whether getting more marks and better grades is better than gaining knowledge and is mugging up everything more use ful than understanding it. The movie has many hilarious scenes and everyone in the film form Aamir to Boman Irani to Omi Vaidya were su perb in their roles. Aamir has outdone himself. Never in the film he has looked 44 year old... Film's music sounds mediocre hut when viewed on the screen then the music sounds perfect.. Cinematography is awesome and so is the direction.. Raju Hirani's screenplay(you can easily ignore a few loose points) is a master piece and the film will achieve cult status for engineering students in a short period of time.. It has the soul which Five Point Someone had.. It is easily Aamir Khan's finest f ilm to date.. The film's climax is fantahulous and is a shocker.. It takes everyone hy surprise.

188,19 October 2018,acforever_36,1, Bollywood Crap,I´ve read some of the reviews here and the majority of the positive reviews are either from people in India or neighboring countries. From an objective point of view this is one of the most cheesy films I've seen in a while. It felt like a horribly long episode of the Big Bang Theory with it´s dated and predictable humour. The dialogues felt like they were literally being read off of a script and did not flow and they may might as well have not spoken english at all because the accents were so poor. Ridiculously overrated. Don't waste your time with this film if you are really into cinema.,

I fail to understand why would the film maker after delivering successfully the definitive message of ""Follow your heart, not the crowd"", try to show some impractical happenstance of 'vacuum-cleaner delivering a baby' or 'fresh-born-baby responding to Aal-is-well zingle' or 'a runaway bride'. Is it just to cater to the Indian audiences who could only settle for their heroes nothing less than supermen and always believe that miracles do happen in ordinary circumstances? This attitude of ours of seeing geniuses in our heroes had earlier given us before heroes who can sing like Kishore Kumar, fight like Dara Singh and dance like Michael Jackson simultaneously. Now our sensible directors settle only for heroes who can make a model of helicopter, top the class without studying, woo the professor's beautiful daughter, and .....hold your breathe....deliver a baby on a pool table.",

The soundtrack is incredible, and are sometimes accompanied by funny scenes and very sad too. Definitely the best Indian film to date.

The use of comedic flavor and serious drama complement each other perfectly to develop the central theme of the movie (which applies to a lot of people studying in countries where rote memorization is the primary approach used to study). Omi Vaidya is the actor that I felt really stood out in this movie. Aamir Khan and the rest of the core actors did a wonderful job in their roles, but Vaidya presented the perfect impressions of someone who has been corrupted by the flawed educational systems of these Asian countries.",

Movie is not only hilarious but also inspirational. This movie questions our current education system not only in India but also worldwide and suggests that what following a passion could lead to. Screenplay, Acting is superb. Aamir Khan is as usual brilliant but we also see noticeable performance from Madhvan, Sharman Joshi and Kareena Kappor.

The acting is mediocre, the laughs are just ok, the obligatory dance sequences leave this American scratching his head. The length at almost 3 hours is way too long for a movie of this sort. And the hero, is well kind of a jerk not a loveable rebel (a quality I usually love to see). And there is way too much predictability in the plot.

258,2 May 2014,sibsankar91,4, Totally artificial- a piece of cheap propaganda.,"Personally I was totally shocked by the stupidity of this work, for I had heard so many people praising it like anything.It has been made with a social agenda which is very much genuine and praiseworthy. But nothing goes correct in the representation. They have picked up some stars and gone for more glamor than realism. They have made a perfect hero and a perfect villain which itself a trait of poor film-making. A really good film should not tell clearly ""hey this is the 'good guy' and look that one is the 'bad guy'"". It should be able to see some good in the 'bad guy' and also some bad in the 'good guy'. Real life does never have perfect heroes and perfect villains, all people are imperfect. This film has has stooped to that cheap superficiality of a crowd-puller. From the beginning till the end they have gone with a motive, there has been no spontaneity. Only redeeming feature has been probably the pleasing musicals. My rating : 4/10 - rotten",
259,1 January 2010,meet_grn,8, Loosely inspired by FPS? - I think not ..,"Watched this movie yesterday - after hearing about the great box office reports, and insistent friends who were pretty vocal about calling it the movie of the decade. Its a hilarious movie, laugh-out-loud funny, and some scenes leave the tummy hurting. There's enough zing for mainstream cinema - which probably explains its amazing business in a couple of weeks of release. While Aamir is fantastic and totally believable as an engineering student (Defying his real age) and everything else about the movie is great, it's the attention to detail that got me hooked enough to decide giving it a second viewing. The plot is reasonably well thought out while originally ""adapted"" from Chetan's book. There are a lot of great things going for the movie - but i was sort of surprised to not see Chetan Bhagat's name anywhere on the credits. After getting out of the screening, got online to figure out what the deal was - and got wind of the huge controversy brewing. As nice a movie as this adaptation is - it is still an adaptation, and having seen the movie, and given the book a second read to get my facts right - i can honestly state that a lot more than half the movie is a lift from the book, so the claim that the screenplay is original does take something away from the whole experience (The film makers claim that the end rolling credits have Chetan Bhagat's name is pretty funny - because frankly, how many stick around to watch the rolling credits!?) Note: I am in no way related to or have any affiliations with Chetan Bhagat. This is just my opinion after having read the book, and watched the movie - to make sense of the lack of credit where its due.",

Evidently no one from Director's family ever had been an engineer and neither he had seen one. Ever if you go and watch this film, just watch it as an mindless (supposed to be) hilarious ride, with almost every joke that you may have heard of. Movie loosely based on the spiced book '5 point someone' by Chetan Bhagat, makes you realize that book was cent percent a better read than the movie. Too long, predictable and TOO LOUD on being 'Ever Joyful Enthusiast Loving Caring' personality. Performances to be acknowledged are of 'Boman Irani' playing the Dean of the Institute & of 'Omi Vaidya' playing Chatur Ramalingam aka 'Silencer'. Best and most humorous scenes are filmed with them.

272,25 January 2010,panuk765,7, Feel Good,"On Christmas day my family and I went to watch a new Bollywood movie called 3 Idiots. Starring Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor. The majority of the film is a flash back of the college days of three young boys, whose future had been decided at birth. Correlating with with the Indian stereotype of: whenever a boy is born he will become an engineer. The moral of the film is that when one finds what they truly love to do, work will become play. This moral is presented to the audience through numerous comedic and emotional situations very well placed throughout the story line. Although much of the story is very predictable, I believe the film was supposed to be this way, as the point of the film was to teach the audience a very important lesson: do what you love to do. As with all Indian films, this one also had the token 'love' part, which no Indian movie seems to be able to function without. This is a recommended watch, whether it is in theaters or on DVD, this movie is a definite 'feel good' film that the whole family will enjoy.

The songs were good too. Naration of madhavan was good.Sharman acted well too especially in the scene where he makes a choice between life and death. Rancho is a very likable character. Kareena plays her part good too(her luck to bag this role after some flops like kurbaan and khambat ishq). The conclusion was so unpredictable.That nerdy guy was funny too.

Many of them seems to have been taken from email forwards that we regularly receive (remember the scene with mixing the examination papers, then pencil-pen astronaut scene, etc etc). Talk of originality .. !(the Five point someone controversy) The movie goes to extremes with emotions - why can't the story be slightly subtle?

All you need is directorial excellence and magical touch of Rajkumar Hirani, supreme performances by as many as six actors in a single movie; Aamir Khan, R Madhwan, Sharman Joshi, Omi Vaidya, Boman Irani and Kareena Kapoor, a story that touches all generations especially youth, a water tight screenplay which feels like a roller coaster ride of fun, emotions, pain, drama, thoughts and new ideas.

Probably a movie like Lagaan or Jodha Akbar might have been a better choice over 3 Idiots which basically is for the younger generation and like most of the movies delivers a common message. I am not quite sure how it got 8.1..The most ridiculous part was the delivery of a baby using a vacuum cleaner, common people who are watching not dumb, can they point out a single instance.

323,23 August 2020,upayansinha,10," there are very few movies nowdays that provides its audience with so much insight, intelligence, and human affection","""All is well,"" the three ""idiot"" heroes of 3 Idiots recite when they become frazzled or nervous, while frantically tapping their hearts. They know that reciting the oversimplifying phrase will not provide their problems with a solution, or even a catalyst, but it gives them the onset courage they desperately need at a time of uncertainty and despair. One character even tries to use the line after an amateurishly-given birth may have gone terribly wrong. It's times like that when the saying may not be so effective, even if its goal is not to provide certain relief.
Our title characters are ambitious but stunted Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), jittery, fearful Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi), and borderline prodigy Ranchhoddas ""Rancho"" Shamaldas Chhanchad (Aamir Khan), three close friends who attend the Imperial College of Engineering (ICE), one of India's most prestigious colleges where only the best are accepted. The young boys already are facing some of life's greatest challenges, all of them pursuing the field of engineering when the only one who seems to have a passion for the material is Rancho. Farhan was forced to become skilled in the field because of his strict father, and Raju is pursuing the field with the goal of getting his family out of poverty, with his father's expensive health bills, his mother's fragile core, and his sister's inability to marry all on the table. Rancho is studying because he feels that one should pursue passion and make a career out of it, so it doesn't feel like work. If you're passionate and devoted to your work, success will find you - yet this is only one of the countless morals and insights 3 Idiots provide its viewer with.
The film chronicles their issues in college in flashback, with instances in the presence popping up to show Farhan and Raju searching for their pal Rancho, who has disappeared and avoided contact for several years now. This is not your typical flashback film, however. It uses this method much to its advantage, and doesn't feel like a narrative within a narrative. It seals both stories nicely, but it takes the viewer on a roller-coaster ride of emotions through carefully constructed events before it even arrives at those endings.
3 Idiots also provides us with the idea that many Indian children are told what to become in life early and are discouraged from exploration or even personal ambition. This I can't believe. What an unhappy, uninspiring, completely wasted life to slog through everyday doing something you loathe all because it was the lucky career choice of your parents. Yet I'm sure millions have been lead through this same life. It's the worst way of ""living through a person"" that I can imagine.
Through every quick-witted song and dance number, through every comedic scene, through every instance of dramatic despair, emotionally alive moment, solemnly poignant sequence, suspenseful setup, to a lovely, heartfelt conclusion, 3 Idiots is a wonderful, invaluable endeavor in the world of film. Its actors are beautifully fitting for their roles, assisted by a script so human and true to life that it is honestly hard to believe, and captured through beautifully alive cinematography to collectively give us a beautiful package not just in the figurative sense. This is arguably one of the best comedies I've ever seen.",

But, yes, there's no denying that Aamir makes you forget all his past achievements as you watch the amazing actor play Rancho. To state that this ranks angst his finest works would be an understatement. Madhavan is incredible, especially in the sequence when he explains his point of view to his father. Sharman is outstanding from start to end. This was a difficult role to portray and only an actor of Clare could've pulled it off. Boman is superb as the vicious head of the institute.

Moreover,it includes jokes that make the whole movie lovely and really entertaining!The actors play really well,allowing anyone who is watching the film to become a part of it!.Furthermore,the funny songs and the wonderful images traveled me in India and in the Indian culture!There are not specific disadvantages!Although,the title could have been either ""Life of Idiots"" or ""Life of Rancho!"" These three hours that I spent to watch this movie where the best three hours of my entire life!Maybe this movie isn't the most famous one,but for me is it is the best!In this movie ""All is Well!!!""",

The movie was an excellent piece of cinema and also one of the best films of the decade in bollywood. Aamir Khan has made me his fan! He is the best and the most versatile actor in the world! This guy looked the most young in the movie, being 44 he played the role of a 23yr old! Madhavan looked a little old for his role but his acting was tremendous, Sharman Joshi was mind blowing! Boman Irani was excellent as usual! Kareena was fine! The screenplay & dialogues by Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijat Joshi were hilarious at times (sometimes it made my jaw hurt), but were also eye opening in parts! The movie was a train ride, and the stops were emotion, drama, comedy, suspense (for a while), and much more. The direction was an absolute delight and the cinematography was refreshing and great (especially the aerial shot of the car going to shimla). The music was also excellent.",

364,18 June 2021,linxuyanyu,10, My thoughts about this movie,"""Three Idiots"" is a comedy released by Bollywood in 2009. This movie is about the friendship between three friends. The three protagonists are called Lan Qiu, Fahan and Raga. Their friendship grew and sprouted in the ivory tower. Lan Qiu does not agree with the high-pressure and hierarchical education system, so he repeatedly challenged the system. When he challenged the school system, he also helped other friends. Like helping Joey make an aerial camera just want to give him a surprise, although Joey had committed suicide when he finished the aerial camera. Lan Qiu also gives his Fahan an advice which is following Fahan's mind because Fahan was afraid of the pressure of his father and family, so he chose mechanical engineering that he didn't like. Lan Qiu told his friend Raga to release the pressure. In order to release stress, Raga turned it into the awe of the gods. But when it was about to graduate, Lan Qiu suddenly disappeared, so Fahan and Raja embarked on a journey to find Lan Qiu. This movie creates glorious, but it does not forget to expose the darkness.",

The 3 idiots creators decided to recreate Chetan Bhagat's ""Five Point Someone"". Unfortunately they failed miserably. All the realism was lost to make the movie more appealing to the masses. Rancho is a student who is kicked out of every class, but still manages to top in the college. Aren't the same professors, who kick him out because of his logic and reasoning, the same ones who grade his papers? The movie also enables the idea that when a student is facing unbearable mental pressure, she/he should attempt to commit suicide and if she/he manages to survive, life will get all fancy for her/him again. Totally ridiculous! The book was so much better. I loved the humor aspects of the book too. The movie just made ridiculous child humor that was borderline funny. Let me not get started on the immense overacting. Boman Irani's character ""Virus"" was so unreal and totally unpalatable. Rancho was annoyingly and unrealistically humble. Kareena's acting was greatly disappointing too. On the whole, I'd say please just read the book instead!",

Aamir's Rancho is a bouncy, fidgety genius with a golden heart. The 44-year-old actor almost passes off as a 22-year-old collegian, bringing out in his character the juvenile buoyancy and vivacity few actors of his age can. Madhavan and Sharman give ample support from the flanks, but a word of praise needs to be reserved for Sharman who shines equally in dramatic as well as funny scenes. Kareena, sadly, has been relegated to a corner but makes her presence felt in a few well-enacted sequences, but it's Boman Irani who comes up with the best performance in the ensemble with his brilliant portrayal of an eccentric professor. His jawline protruded, his brows pursed, his gait ungainly, his speech lisped, Irani is every bit the vile and virulent Virus he's supposed to be.",

This time, he doesn't have Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi. So, this time we have Aamir Khan, Sharman Joshi and R. Madhavan playing college students. The hype is tremendous. But what about the movie? Our heroes enter a top engineering college with shining eyes full of dreams, and hopes for a better future. Life gives them a reality check in the shape of Viru Sahastrabuddhe, their dominating principal who believes that life is a race, and that is the only way it has to be lived. Rancho, (Aamir Khan, looking surprisingly youthful, but still older than an engineering student) keeps motivating his friends to learn rather than mug the subjects. While most people refuse to take the path less traveled, Rancho continues to excel on this path, and even beat those who take the conventional track. The frequent run-ins with the Principal, what happens to the friends in college is what forms the crux of the story.",

Certain sequences almost have you rolling in the aisle, like the ragging sequence, Omi's speech, the three some's wedding crasher sequence, their mournful meal with Raju's mournful mum and Rancho's sundry demos to prove how Kareena has chosen the wrong guy for herself. Add to this, the strong emotional core of the film that makes gentle tugs, now and then, at your guts, and you have an almost perfect score. Hirani carries forward his simplistic 'humanism alone works' philosophy of the Lage Raho Munnabhai series in 3 Idiots too, making it a warm and vivacious signature tune to 2009.

At the same time, the film also reflects a lot of more realistic content, such as inequality between classes, as well as differences in educational concepts and learning methods, values, etc. In that school, Rancho seemed to be a different kind.

But what really helps the viewers to enjoy the movie is the humorous way in which it is able to send a message. Agreed some of the humor was a bit corny but still it keeps you glued to the screen until the end. Amir Khan was a class apart. Almost each of his scenes had some message in it, in a straightforward or comical way. Madhavan & Sharman were the perfect supporting casts. Boman Irani made up a truly memorable performance & Omi Vaidya was hilariously & annoyingly brilliant as Chatur. Kareena Kapoor too did good.

Although suicides aren't that frequent but most people are under enormous burden to shine and shoulder the responsibilities of the family. The pressure is tremendous and the competition is very high. This film captures that, and the actors & film crew does the job very well, but most credit to the writers and musicians for the good songs. Like every film, views will vary among viewers but like almost all of top250 movie, this one has got a certain class. only drawback is the use of 40+ actors as engineering students.

472,6 July 2017,bachispicaqtmz,10, Never let the dream die,"I was so moved at this film. There are three college students. They are studying about engineering. But Farhan, as a narrator in the film, prefers taking photos of animals to engineering. In India, it is said that men are expected to be an engineer and women are a doctor. So Farhan gives up his dream. One day, an genius boy enters this college and made friends with Farhan and another main character, Raju. He is Rancho. His pet phrase is 'Aal izz well'. He is very good at engineeing and does not hesitate to say his thoughts or opinions to anybody who has wrong ideas. Both Farhan and Raju gradually trust him. As this is a Bollywood film, the scenes of musical are shown. Their dancing is very cheerful and energetic. This film teaches us what learning is. Some people thinks entering a great school is a goal. Some people thinks they have to be an ideal man or woman as the parents wish you to be. But Rancho has doubts about them. He thinks it is most important to cherish your dream. So he helps Farhan to make himself to be honest to his father, and Farhan can manage to tell his true feelings and becomes a photographer at last. I love Raju's attitude for leaning. He does not care about the grade in test or academic background at all. He purely loves to learn. I could not stand crying at his sincerity. This film is not only serious but also hilarious, so makes me laugh often. The ending is very very great. I want to watch this film again and again. And I try to keep the phrase in mind 'Aal Izz Well'.",

It is no spoiler but this movie deals with the current problems in Indian society where one's academic career decides his/her life. And there are some scenes that I have experienced in my daily lives in Japan.
For example, there is a scene a the father of one of the 3 idiots denies his dream to be a photographer because the father gave everything to send him into a good college. It is of course that academic records matter but it should not be ""EVERYTHING"" in one's life. 
Japanese society still tends to put the most great value on academic careers and our university exams stress us a lot. Maybe all the students have to watch it to reflect on what they have done and will do (but only after the exams are over!).",

The acting was outstanding and very natural. The cinematography was very clean and smooth. The story was amazing and inspiring. The musical parts are fantastic. For me, it is a perfect film. I liked every thing about it. The TRT was approximately 3 hours, yet every seconds and minutes of it was perfection. At first I thought it was just like the same ""common"" type of comedy film. But I was wrong, it was different. It was unique in many ways. The mixture, chemistry and transitions of comedy and drama of this film was done perfectly. This is the kind of film that all people should watch. This is the kind of film that will teach you a lot of moral lessons in life. This film will help enlighten people and I promise to all that this film will change your life.",

490,5 January 2015,michelleghislaine,8, A fresh coming of age tale with a big heart!,"I just finished watching 3 Idiots and was rather glad I gave it a chance! The high rating on IMDb roused my attention to its existence, however the title seemed to suggest some slapstick tale (of which I am also partial too from time to time), though as I read the synopsis I became intrigued with the premise of a comedy/drama/Bollywood/musical set mostly in a college campus. I couldn't think of anything I'd ever seen before falling into all of these categories simultaneously and I also felt I needed to give Bollywood a bit more of a chance as my repertoire is quite slim in this department to date! I won't say much about the plot (my summary is about as much as I'd like to give away), as I watched the movie pretty blind of what was to unfold and I really felt swept away in what at times felt like an epic journey of twists and turns; nothing too ridiculous to prompt a 'WTF?!' response, I felt the pace of the film moved really nicely along with realistic and believable scenarios interjected not for shock value but to aid the storytelling. The characters were well fleshed out and I really came to feel a sort of camaraderie with this not altogether hapless but lovable bunch with the main character Rancho, especially likable despite his bad-boy status with the Director of the college 'Virus'. Sometimes I felt a few scenes played out a little like a spoof, feeling slightly cheesy, however I have a feeling some of this vibe came from the cultural gully you often find with having to rely on subtitles (though as another reviewer said, pidgin English is used throughout the film so sometimes you don't need the subtitles). If musicals make you cringe then I guess you may feel a bit like the scenes with sporadic bursting into song are unnecessary, but you have to not only expect this from Bollywood films but also value it as an important part of the storytelling in its own right; plus, the songs in this film are catchy, well crafted and appropriate for the mood attempting to be set. As a final note, if someone was to ask me 'what makes a great movie?', I'd probably answer something like this; It should make me laugh and maybe cry, then come away thinking more about the film and its underlying meanings. Characters should be well formed enabling me to fall in love with them (or even begin to hate them) so, caring if they live or die; to feel their pain and joy and be able to absorb myself into their adventure as though just one of the gang. The look of a film should make me want to make screen-shots just so I could take a closer look at the subtle fleeting beauty that is a single frame, and together, the mosaic of images creating a flow so appealing to the eye that it lends a resonance to the script and plot without distracting you from the deeper message. With that in mind I'd say '3 Idiots' succeeded on many levels and left me feeling satisfied, unlike many highly praised blockbusters of late which have left me feeling jaded and apathetic. There are a couple of scenes where, should I dare say it, 'The Sound of Music' came to mind, though I won't say why other than perhaps the beautiful scenery and the innocent feel to the actions of the characters in comparison to the overly sassy and promiscuous teenager of many Hollywood films these days. Overall, I think my score of 8 is fair given how the movie made me feel, it's lasting impression on me and the fact that I could easily watch it again- perhaps even adding it to my favorites list. I would recommend others to give it a go, even if you're not partial to musicals or Bollywood, or subtitles- so what?! You can always be surprised and I have a feeling you might be!",

It's very entertaining and amusing. The whole cast was great every actor played his character very well specially (Boman Irani) and (Aamir Khan) for being 44 years old and performing a younger character with almost no changes in age. This movie is awesome not because of one actor or a couple of actors, it is a joint effort of every member of this movie.

Besides the funny parts - expected from a self described comedian movie - the movie was disappointing me... until it started the second part. This final part added the drama needed for a perfect movie: it showed us real human problems. Even more: it showed how to solve it. All in a funny way. The main problem of the movie was: should we follow our heart to do what we like in our professional choice or just do what our parents ""suggests""? Other secundary problems - but not less important - were showed as well and all the adventure to solve it made the movie simply beautiful. Highly recommended.",

Movie revolves around Ranchordas(Amir Khan) and his two friends Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi).Ranchordas(Amir Khan)as a Engineering Student denied to bound by traditional teaching practices and tried to convey,teaching is at it's best when it is served with simplicity and fun. Boman Irani as Professor Viru Sahastrabudhhe (ViruS) was the only piece in the movie who achieved it's purpose and he was so factual that he could make you, to thank God, to not to cast you in his class-room. Film editor has made a wonderful job to montage all sequences in a self-explainory manner and it was non other but Rajkumar only. Like Amir Khan's other movies he looked here stiffed too, he has failed make any appeal to audience but still his quick clear with perfectly synchronized mover made this movies alive and he had perfect timing for humor punches too. Cinematography is not the thing for director as observed from ""munna bhai MBBS"" and ""Lage raho munna bhai"" but his movies are justified as soon as these are kept in commercial cinema. All I personally liked in this movie was it's script which is soul of the movie but when conspiracy evolved from the all time best seller writer Chetan Bhagat for the story plot nothing was left in the movie. When you personally read his famous book Five Point someone you will also have the sympathy for him.

Not just any kind of silly and cringey fillers to make up the story. The acting, editing, dialogues, script, music everything is on point. The more important thing is that it actually had an impact on Indian parents. My own parents started telling me - ""Do whatever you want in life"" This is the thing that makes this particular movie so unique- it doesn't just try to make a point in society, it has actually truly made an impact on the society and has helped it change. I don't think any other movie in the entire world has actually made a change in society as deep as this one.",

553,29 September 2018,keshabbaskota,10, Absolutely Awesome!,By Keshab Baskota ,
554,28 September 2018,keshabbaskota,10, Awesome movie,"In Rajkumar Hirani's inspirational comedy film, 3 Idiots, Rancho (Aamir Khan), is a college student who does not hesitate at all to achieve success. He assists his two friends, Farhan and Raju, by feeding inspirational advice to alter their way of thinking. The film begins when the two friends get together because Chatur ""Silencer"" Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya) calls Farhan and claims that he has found out where Rancho is. All three of them get together and travel to Shimla to find Rancho, who has disappeared since graduation. While on the car to Shimla, a flashback story is painted which shows Farhan and Raju starting their college year in the Imperial College of Engineering (ICE) in Delhi. Rancho has a conviction that hands on learning is the best and goes to class to learn, rather than achieve good grades. Farhan and Raju have their own personal dilemmas which is why they end up at ICE. The institution's director, Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani) is also a professor known as ""Virus"" in the ICE community. Virus's traditional philosophies on education contrast heavenly to Rancho's carefree and easygoing love for learning. Rancho and Virus's daughter, Pia (Kareena Kapoor), fall for each other but things start to fall apart when the influence of friends is embraced which leads to bad choices 
 When I watched this film It was in 2014, it was a cold windy Saturday morning. My first impression was, ""here we go again, another boring film!"" Because after reading the title, my brain instantly thought this movie was a flop. But I kept watching because it starred the talented, Aamir khan, who is one of the best actors of Bollywood. The film was hysterically funny and inspirational. The song, Give me some sunshine, is very powerful as it relates to most college students' life. The lyrics, ""give me some sunshine, give me some rain...Give me another chance I wanna grow up once again..."", gives me flashbacks about my childhood and want to relive those moments again where the sun was shining bright; where the clouds would spit out heavy rain which would swell the plants and create loud intimidating drops that simply calms your soul. We are all tired and need a little rain and a little sunshine in our foreheads sometimes. The climax of the film is when Rancho and his friends are caught asleep behind the back seats of the class by Virus. They were all drunk, but Rancho and Raju were awake from it and up sitting down with their blurry faces. Virus walks in and calls, Raju's name and he awkwardly replies, ""present sir!"" The bottle rolls on the floor and goes down to the front row where Silencer picks it up confidently and takes a sniff. Raju is called to Virus's office and is forced into an extreme scenario: He is forced to choose between Rancho or himself to be rusticated from ICE. Raju is stuck between sacrificing his poor family or his best friend. At the end, he jumps from the window and is immediately rushed to the hospital. I think this scene sums up what college experience really is: it is about the decisions you make as you mature. It is really a heart touching scene for the audience. It creates the pathos appeal as the it kicks in with the lyrics, ""We won't let go of you. We won't let you go!"" It is hard to translate it to English but the second sentence is inversed from the first sentence; this is done to paint an even picture in the audiences' minds because the meaning is same, but it is said in a different order. 
 Truely, an absolute powerful movie that teaches a significant life moral: do what you love to do, and your career will be that.",

It is inspire from a novel Five Point Someone.Greatest,realistic, entertaining movie I love it. It is the story of 3 friends Farhan,Raju and Rancho. When three student enter the engineering college they faced ragging session but today we are enough lucky that their is no more ragging session and it is an illegal act. "" What is machine ? "" The definition of machine everyone in his class memorized the definition but they never thought that it can be said in very easy way only we have to know the concept and utilize it now in the movie Rancho said the answer "" Anything that simplifies work and saves time is a machine. In a warm day, press a button and you get a blast of air-a fan, that's a machine. Speak to a friend miles away - the telephone, that's a machine. Compute millions in seconds - a calculator, a machine. We are surrounded with machines, from a pen's nib to a pants zip, all machines "" . It is exactly the machine means. He guided his friends not only in educational way but also he gave some life mantras which is useful to live a live. "" All izz well "" - the song it doesn't mean everything will be well but from inside it gave a courage and strength to fight back in bad situation . Raju when he started to fight back against his fear he had reached his destiny that means dedication,hard work and if we control our fear and nervousness then we can reach out goal. Farhan was interested in photography but he was study engineering which doesn't give any interest to him from this we can say if you are interested in that course then only join otherwise not don't choose any option which is not make you interest and don't pressure your child choose according to you please give them chance to choose his or her(child) own interest course which he/she want. Rancho had an innovative mind he doesn't believe in only getting degree but he believed in getting lots of knowledge and applying them in real life. Practical knowledge so that we can apply in future.He always want to give answer in logical way . Another song give me some sunshine this song means lot I can relate every line.Once we grow up we want to have those childhood days where we enjoy our life happily without stress.Every parents want his or her child should score 90%marks then parent will gift watch otherwise stick but in reality marks are needed but if you can't score 90%then it doesn't mean you are useless we should always target 90%and we should also deep clear concept about the subject and have practical knowledge to utilize it in real life .It is an amazing movie it gave lots of message.

The second half is good,but slightly drags in some scenes but it doesn't hurt the film much. 3 idiots is not only an exceptional film, it is arguably the film of the year.

The story of the film is about India's education system, which does not encourage students to choose their destination by their wish, rather than it forces us to follow the regular rules of the system to race.
In this film, we see a lot of characters Rancho(Aamir Khan), Farhan(R Madhavan), Raju (Sharman Joshi) are the main leading characters. They got admitted to the city's elite college, where they meet their principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe(Boman Irani). Who was very strict with his rules. For that everyone in the college was afraid of him but in behind everyone call him VIRUS.
Rancho was joyful and limitless who always gives challenges to the difficulties of life, takes it very lightly. Raju and Farhan were different. They were afraid of parents, teachers, and also exams. Both of them have their different family problems. In this movie, we see how Rancho changes their life and also their way of thinking. Here we also can see an interesting character Chatur (Omi), Who always follows the race and want to become the winner. Presence of Priya( Kareena Kapoor) makes it quite romantic and emotional. And the small argues with VIRUS entertaining the audience, especially the Chamatkar/Balatkar speech. Music & Choreography were really awesome.

There was a period of time where I would watch this movie, or at least parts of the movie, multiple times in the week. Yet, it never got old. I still cried at the sad scenes and laughed just as much at the happy parts. This is because the events in the movie are just so touching and can cause anyone watching to connect with the characters. The movie deals with so many issues, such as the dichotomy between career and passion and the stresses and mental health of college students. It holds so many beautiful lessons while discussing these issues, such as what it means to have a true friendship, the love of learning, and the importance of resilience and optimism in life. The main character makes this movie what it is, and is such an amazing person that truly inspires me. He has such a passion for learning, is the best friend anyone could ask for, and is simply kind and loves life. He is grateful for life and his experiences in a way that is so inspiring - all he wants is to soak up as much knowledge as possible through life and have a positive attitude. That being said, the other 2 main characters also have wonderful backstories and their character development is so beautiful and inspiring to watch. I can say this is one of my favorite movies, and I will never get bored of it. The countless lessons this movie provides are worth the watch, and the comedy in the movie is very well-written.

While none of the characters are portrayed as gay, the numerous references made to the male buttocks are enough to make one take note. It is referred to as a ""gift that is being requested for acceptance"" at the new students initiation ceremony, with many of the new students strutting and gyrating in just their underwear, including a scene with an underwear pulled down slightly to reveal a side of the buttock, with a stamp of approval on it, like it was certified A+ grade meat, or beef (gay male). In addition the name of the hero (Amir Khan) in the movie is too long to say at the initiation, and is considered to be ""quite a mouthful"". There is another scene in a song where all three lead actors are seated with their backs to the camera, on seats that have the shape of male buttocks, and then turn around while seated in them and rub the buttock shaped seats with their hands while smiling suggestively. There is also a song where the students are taking baths but that could be considered to be as communal shower although with the shorts covered with loin cloths. Other scenes include pants dropped to the ankles from time to time, with some scenes also involving turning of the person to the camera and whacking it to be accepted in defeat with the pants down. It might be overlooked as being funny, but these scenes are heavy in gay overtones. Otherwise just another Indian movie with a strong message of friendship.",

But after watching it again for the 50th time (no joke) I knew I had to write a review. I remember watching this movie when it was first released in theaters. As an 11 year-old Indian- American my hindi was pretty bad and some of the comedic scenes such as the one where Chatur was giving the speech in front of his school and made a mess (which i consider one of the best comedic scenes in any movie) went right over my head. Even the central message of the film which was to not follow success, but to do what you love and that success would follow you, was something I had still yet to understand. But now, watching this movie as a 20 year-old college student, really resonated with me. The trials and tribulations of being successful to appease your parents while also still battling the true aspirations that reside within you. All I can end this review by saying is this movie is truly a masterpiece and sure it did have some ridicoulous moments and scenes which could have been done without. But it's essence is timeless and even 30 years later, kids and adults alike will connect with this film.",

Rancho is there between us, in fact inside us,just we have to find him. Coming back to the history of Bollywood, one can only say the names of classical hits like Mughal-e-azam,and flicks like Tare Zameen Par,Rang De Basanti and Chak De-India to feel extremely proud(this can be a bit too harsh) and here comes these 3-Idiots with their not so Idiotic rules and principles which can cause a rush of ADRENALINE in your body and tears in your EYES and you love it. This film also present the fact that we Indians seldomly select the education and profession which we like, we have to fulfill the dreams of others,we are all proud of this but still one can only imagine what we could have done if we would have done what we wanted to and this movie made that imagination true.Mr.Phunsukh Wangdu You stick to your seats till Intermission and gets stuck to it after that. When the end of the movie comes you simply will feel that why it has to end,why can't it continue. Acting- No-one could have replaced anyone in this movie.Kareena was the best selection made by Raju Hirani and a lot of things has been said for AMIR KHAN,so i don't have words to describe,just like KAREENA said in her interview, ""You have to work with AMIR KHAN to be a complete Actor"".

Every character in the movie has acted brilliantly, despite their small roles Kareena,Madhavan and even Millimeter(I don't know his real name) excel. Chatur aka ""Silencer"" has given marvelous performance in his first Bollywood movie.Thoug it is based on 5 point someone but it takes very few scenes from the blockbuster novel and the most certainly it is more entertaining than the novel. Watch it for fun and for a strong message.",
670,11 January 2010,pratik1812,10, After 'Jaadu ki jhappi' and 'Gandhigiri' its 'aal izz well',"In a late scene from the film, 2 of the 3 idiots zip down their pants and pat their bottoms facing the third idiot. Rather than feeling gross at that instant, you have a lump in throat. For the zillionth time in a Hindi film, a bride runs away from the pheras on her wedding day. But the scene still doesn't come across as clichéd. For a group of all-male engineering students, to 'deliver' means to literally carry out a delivery operation on a woman in labour pain. And when the motionless newborn responds to a goodwill chant of 'aal izz well' in true-blue Manmohan Desai mode, you fail to find a fault in the filmi formula. That's the golden touch of Rajkumar Hirani.",

But as we go through the second half you witness the structure come undone, the director packing everything in as though ticking items off a list, and the humour is drained away. Some plot points of the second half are rammed in without consideration for the whole. It lets itself down after such a fun first half.",
673,4 February 2016,amansaxena,9," Watched it multiple times, still entertaining","I have watched this movie a lot of times and never got bored always enjoyed thoroughly. If we talk about the collections, many Bollywood movies have crossed its grossing though but, they aren't even close to its standards. Getting a 300Cr film in 2009 was not easy. Well, I know one should never judge by the collections but, sometimes when they cross a mark, indicates even the intellect audience is paying to watch it. The narration itself from Farhan's POV keeps you bonded with the movie. All the characters were so strong that you fall in love with them easily. You will only agree with me when you watch it. Simply, Raju Hirani + Aamir Khan = Masterpiece!!!
In one sentence - the best Bollywood movie ever! If you are into movies, then this one is not to be missed. The acting is incredible by the ensemble cast. The script is funny and at the same time. Even the scenery is breath-taking. Although the length of the film is pretty long and has some quirky musical numbers, 3 idiots is a delight.
It is worth the watch! I laughed! And I'm giving this a 10!",
674,20 April 2016,bhowmickpatidar,10, The best Indian Movie of all time.,"It has to be the most idiotic start to such a fascinating movie. You wonder where the movie is heading to when an airplane returns to base after a passenger(R.Madhavan) suffers a heart attack in an infirm manner. But Rajkumar Hirani soon gets his act and cast together to deliver a stunning product. Education is not about success; it's about pursuing excellence and doing what you are passionate about. In the end, success will chase you. This oft-repeated dialogue is beautifully portrayed in the climax. I have never laughed so hard before leaving a theater and you surely don't feel as a fourth idiot in the theater. ",

You aren't restless. 3 idiots demonstrates how strong film-making can enhance and elevate an already solid concept. film is nothing short of an event. The supremely talented actor acts in one film a year and no two films are ever identical in terms of plot line.To sum up, 3 idiots is commercial Hindi cinema at its best. The film has 'Hit' written all over it. Let me put it this way: Cancel whatever you're doing today and go watch 3 idiots instead.Director strikes a fine balance between humor and emotions. The comic portions are executed with panache, the drama is attention-grabbing and the emotional quotient is strong enough to turn you moist-eyed. The marriage of humor and emotions as also technique and content is what drives 3 idiots to the winning post.",

700,24 April 2020,srutishaw-80264,10, #3 idiots review,"3 idiots is a good example for students who believe on ratta .
The film begins with entry of threesome idiots in the city's elite engineering college. It takes the first trust with the mandatory ragging session which enunciate who the leader of the gang is going to be: new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends fondly call him. Rancho not only leads his friends through the maze of India's competitive, high-pressure, rote-heavy, illogical and almost cruel education system, he tutors them on several life mantras too. Like, running after excellence, not success; questioning not blindly accepting givens; inventing and experimenting in lieu of copying and
cramming; and essentially following your heart's calling if you truly want to make a difference.
So, you have the threesome embroiled, time and again, in a confrontation with authority, as represented through the domineering figure of Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), the unsmiling Principal who venerates the cuckoo because the bird's life begins with murder. Kill the competition, because there is only one place at the top, believes the Princi. Poor, mistaken Princi! Doesn't he know that competition is effete, model students like Chatur (Omi) end up as duhs in real life and non-
conformists (Rancho and Rocket Singh Inc), who care tuppence about being on top, could end up as eventual winners. More importantly, they could be high not only in IQ (intelligence quotient) but in EQ (emotional quotient) too, never losing their humaneness and social networking skills.
The high point of the film is the fact that director Rajkumar Hirani says so much, and more, without losing his sense of humour and the sheer lightness of being. The film is a laugh riot, despite being high on fundas. Certain sequences almost have you rolling in the aisle, like the ragging sequence, Omi's chamatkar/balatkar speech, the threesome's wedding crasher sequence, their mournful meal with Raju's mournful mum and Rancho's sundry demos to prove how Kareena has chosen the wrong guy for herself. Add to this, the strong emotional core of the film that makes gentle tugs, now and then, at your guts, and you have an almost perfect score. Hirani carries forward his simplistic 'humanism alone works' philosophy of the Lage Raho Munnabhai series in 3 Idiots too, making it a warm and vivacious signature tune to 2009. The second half of the film does falter in parts, specially
the child birth sequence, but it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track.
Amongst the performances, Aamir Khan is stupendous as the rule-breaker Rancho. But the rest of the cast doesn't remain in the shadows. Both Sharman and Madhavan manage to carve their independent characters as lovable rebels too. Even Kareena shines out, despite the minuscule
length of her role. A special mention for Boman Irani who is impeccable as 'Virus', the vile Principal and newcomer Omi who perfectly slips into the stereotype of the best, albeit bakwas student. Shantanu Moitra's music score, which may have sounded pheeka in the audio version, comes alive on screen with lyricist Swanand Kirkire giving India its clarion call for 2010: Aal Izz Well. Rush for it!!.",

708,5 May 2020,debrajmaji-34638,10," ""Bachcha Kabil Bano, Kabil.. Kamyabi Toh Saali Jhak Maarke Peeche Bhagegi.""","Kudos to director Rajkumar Hirani to doing something more than justice to Chetan Bhagat's novel five point someone. The story revolves around 3 friends namely Farhan (R. Madhavan), Raju (Sharman Joshi) and Rancho (Aamir Khan) and their journey of 4 years through an engineering college.
The film begins with Farhan and Raju going on a searching spree for Rancho after 10 years of their college life has ended. Over the whole of journey of road they keep on lamenting the memories of their elite college life. It takes the first trust with the mandatory ragging session which enunciates who the leader of the gang is going to be. At this point enters the ever charming Aamir Khan as Rancchodas. Rancho not only led his friends through all the mazes of peer pressure, illogical educational system but also taught them some excruciating exciting life mantras.
Through the journey of college life, the three musketeers came in a confrontation with the authority as represented through the dominating figure of Viru Sahastrabuddhe who's only principle to life is, to win the race of life you need to be fast or else ""you'll be like the broken egg of a cuckoo bird."" Doesn't he know that competition is effete, model students like Chatur (Omi) end up as duhs in real life and non-conformists like Rancho who care tuppence about being on top, could end up as eventual winners. More importantly, they could be high not only in IQ (intelligence quotient) but in EQ (emotional quotient) too, never losing their humaneness and social networking skills.
In the process of travelling through the journey of college life, Rancho falls in love with Pia (Kareena Kapoor) who happens to be Viru Sahastrabuddhe's daughter and they inspite of all the odds in the path as destiny has carved out, Ranchho and Pia do end up together after a long wait of 10 years.
The second half of the movie holds special mention due to its sudden turn of events as of Raju's suicide attempt to the child birth sequence. But it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track.
The best part of the film is that, this film is a factory of life lessons yet Hirani for not even once loses the humor essence of the movie. Certain sequences might even have you rolling on the floor, like the ragging sequence, Omi's ""chamatkar"" speech, the mournful meal with Raju's mom, attending Pia's sister's wedding, Ranchos sundry demo of how Pia has chosen the wrong guy for himself.
3 idiots is a complete package watch from comedy to seriousness to life lessons to carry with yourself throughout. Along with the incredible acting of all the actors, Shantanu Moitra's music score gave the movie a whole new level of life.
Having being released in the year 2009, 3 idiots still now holds a good rank in our hearts when reminded of a Sunday Afternoon Movie Marathon with family!",

I don't watch movie but I watch this movie because of my cousin. Then I feel very happy watching the movie. I have seen some wonderfully entertaining movie but this movie is wonderful then other movie. I doesn't watch more movie to consider this when you read this review. Indian has many movies but this is a very long film almost three hour. ""3 Idiots"" is an excellent movie I loved to watch this movie many times. The beginning part is kind of with my expectation. Two idiots started to turn the world around them upside down by highly over the top actions they propagate an observatory of the Imperial College of Engineering aka ICE their Alma mater to meet a friend they have lost communication for six years. Then my feelings about this movie was different than any other comedies. It all started with a generous chant that opens the main story line. The main character, Rancho, was a guy who was include in ICE. However he was totally different than any other students. And he focused more on the efficient aspect of the knowledge. As a result he was capable to blow a pretty in the groin with electricity. There was another student he was very good and who was working on his own helicopter project. However, their director/dean virus is a nick name of course wouldn't allow graduating. Rancho understands the education policy was extremely flawless. It publicized the personalities of all the students, focusing on nothing but the grades. Rancho determined to setup opposition to it. He concealed requisition his teachers and even director. Rancho made two friends Farhan and Raju to inspire his two friends and really inspired them. When I was watch the movie than I learn when I face any problem then I say all is well. This won't solve your problems but it will give the mettle to face it. Prey success will follow. Life is not about acquirement marks grades but chasing your dreams. 3 Idiots these are the golden rules which indoctrinate very light and all way. Now I enunciate ending of the movie was so touching that anybody and shed rheum from their eyes with a small yarn that would made everything entertaining once again. 3 Idiots is a fantastic movie. This movie covers everything in it love, friendship and a grave message of how to achieve your goals. The movie story is excellent and is really affecting because it's too close reality. Amir Khan Performance is brilliant and perfect. I doesn't watch movie but I watch 3 idiots 3 times. And even through every time it's diverting. Most movie of the genre it has its share of the customary singing and dancing so foreign to firms from other counties. You should know one thing is that destine the type of movie it is not verily easy. 3 Idiots is a comedy much but it also has many acute traces some existential moments where they pursue the meaning of life and work of life and it's also a loving movie in a relationship to friendship. We can say 3 idiots is a message to the parents of the youth and in this time that is time to stop actives pressure to an already throng out demographic. In brief the basic theme of the movie is that chase and superb and success will follow. 3 Idiots has the expectation to break all records and collect all awards.",

With his genius he kept away from the ragging not just that he rebuffed the senior just as. Raju, Farhan and rancho were the roommate after at that point.
Raju has a place from a lower-working class family, Farhan was a working class family child. Raju is religious and Farhan consistently needed to be a wild life picture taker yet his family constrained them to do engineering so they came here. Another side Rancho was consistently a commendable understudy and consistently needed to be an engineer. He never put stock in the arrangement of learning of the school. Commonly we can see that he got into arguments with the teachers. Many times we can see that he got into arguments with the professors. He is very famous for unorthodox questions, answers, and innovations.
Farhan and Raju were constantly frustrated by the instruction framework and they were not doing great in the opposition yet rancho was continually doing acceptable outcomes by not considering 24 h yet doing everything. Chattur was the first boy of each class. He generally stands first in each test. Instructors and educators were extremely content with his exhibition however here is rancho who quietly crushed him in each test and on each event. Yet, Rancho was never on the great book of the instructors. The educator called an infection never observed rancho as a decent understudy and he generally chides Raju and Farhan to leave him. This made weight on Farhan and Raju. Viru sent a letter to Farhan and Raju's folks about their performance. Raju got into deep depression and endeavored suicide. However, karma supported Raju was spared by the assistance of rancho pia and Farhan. Here we can see the mother's affection towards his child. A moms' affection can fix any issue of life.
Meanwhile, Rancho and pia, the girl of Virus got into a relationship. Yet, rancho was consistently cognizant about his future objective and he showed pia exercise of her life and opened her eyes. Rancho instructed that a rich man isn't generally a sharp man.",

It promises lots of laughs and also a heart-touching message. That movie changes the viewing angle of your life. The story of 3 idiots has been told differently and most importantly, the story offers so many twists-n-turns that you just can't guess what would be next. I loved every moment of this movie and I hope to watch a lot of future Indian movies like this. I have watched 3 idiots almost 10 times and every time it's entertaining. Every part of the movie will keep you entertaining and you won't like to miss anything. That film's climax is fantabulous and shocking. It takes everyone's surprise.
I like that dialogue ""all is well"". If you afraid just say it and you feel relax. I think this movie breaks all the records. I would also give a lot of credit to the director Rajkumar Hirani, that movie ranks him top Bollywood director. If it is possible, I could give this movie a higher than 10 ratings. This movie is funny, charming, loving always unpredictable in every situation. You try to find what happened next. This movie teaches us how to learn in the class, how to handle the critical situation. This movie shows us the hard work of engineering students do.
That is one of the best favorite movie in Bollywood. Everyone must watch that movie and never lose your hope. All is well, All is well & All is well.",

724,17 September 2020,pujasahaaiub,5, The best movie I ever seen,"Last Saturday, we watched an Indian movie entitled ""3 Idiots"". It is a great film and I must tell you that it is a great experience. At first, I actually taught that it is a typical comedy movie but I was wrong. There are so many lessons to be learned in the film. The first lesson is we should always follow our passion. Very often, we deceive ourselves by giving in to the demands of the people around us, rather than following what our minds dictate. We go by the set standards of the society and ignore our real passion.
We end up becoming average professionals in the field that we enter and on the other hand, the field that happens to be our real passion loses a potential talent. An example given in the movie is a person who has a passion for photography walks into an engineering college and ends up becoming an average engineer, while the fine arts industry loses a good photographer. The second lesson is do not learn to get success, learn for knowledge. When we strive hard to learn and improve our knowledge, we move ahead in life.
Never run after success but let it automatically happen to your life. The third lesson is we should enjoy the present. We either lose ourselves in the maze of past success and failures, or worry ourselves sick about the future. We cannot change what has already happened and we cannot predict what happens in future. Instead, we should focus on doing our day to day work with eagerness and excitement, then we end up positively influencing the future.
Helping others helps you grow mentally and easily associates you. A lasting relationship is created by helping others. In the film, Rancho helps Raju and Farhan in choosing right careers for them and follow their dreams. This creates an everlasting bond between friends, not only friends but with anyone whom we help. You grow as a person and never have to look back in life. This movie is an eye opener to each one of us. I recommend that every student should watch this film, they will not only apply it to their studies but to their everyday life.
Aamir Khan as Rancho plays the role of a very bright student who motivates his friends pursue their passion and make a career out of it. R.Madhavan as Farhan who wants to become a wildlife photographer but was forced to pursue engineering because of his strict father . Sharman Joshi as Raju who is pursuing engineering with the goal of getting his family out of extreme poverty. Boman Irani as virus who plays the role of a strict college director who is highly competitive Kareena Kapoor as Pia who plays the role of virus's daughter and falls in love with Aamir khan. The film goes very smooth. The film's first half includes ragging scene, confrontations with the professor, Chatur's speech and mournful meal at Raju's home. Overall the film depicts a very nice mingle of comedy, suspense and motivational. All the actors and co-actors done a commendable job. The music of the film was very soothing. The back ground music supports the film all through the movie. Overall dipiction is fine. Some of the scenes are really emotional. Overall rating is excellent. It is definitely a one-time watch.",

But after I try to open up my heart and watch this movie, it made me realize that Indian movies are just as good as other countries! Even though there are interrupted songs in the movie, I think this is a very good and catchy song. I must admire Aamir Khan who is both the director and the main actor. He was able to create a really good movie. It is a movie that has all tastes - happiness, sadness, funny, and also hidden with insights throughout the story. Which we can understand and feel into it, because it is a story that we can meet in real life such as competitive exams, the expectations of the people around you, and the goals that must be reached.",
743,11 March 2021,muhammadbilaltaufiqurahman,10, This Film is Full of comedy and life lesson,"Briefly, the films narrate the adventure of three engineering students or the three idiots consisting of Rancho (Aamir Khan), Farhan (R. Madhavan), and Raju (Shaarman Joshi). Their reasons for attending the Imperial College of Engineering varies, for Rancho he always admired learning and studying since his is a child, while Farhan originally wanted to become a wildlife photographer, but instead he attends engineering school because of a pressure from his parents, and for Raju he wanted to become an engineer because he originally came from a destitute family and wanted to save his family from poverty. Despite all of their reasons, they actually quite have a wondrous adventure in their years of studying engineering in ICE, and they sure are going to make you laugh. Here are some examples of scenes that might put a smile on your face.
In the first night of being a college freshman, Farhan and Raju are being humiliated by the college senior as it's their first day tradition in their institution. All of the freshman in the institution including Farhan and Raju are forced to be naked only covered by their underwear and getting their buttocks stamped ""Chicken Ok"" to honor their senior as the tradition. While Farhan and Raju are being embarrass Rancho come in late and also forced by the senior to take off his outfit but Rancho disobey him, it's the first time Farhan and Raju met Rancho. Furthermore, as Rancho disobey him, he seems a bit confused and threated at the same time, the then calm himself by saying ""all is well"". And then when the senior is distracted by humiliating the others freshmen, he rushed into his dorm and locked the door, showing his bravery and fearlessness. As the sound of dashing wind and the sound of slammed door the senior noticed and count from one until ten and threatens to piss on his door for one semester. With his engineering mind he created a device with the supplies in his dorm, a device that can transmit electricity if water hit the device. After the count to ten is up, before the senior piss on his door he slides a tip of spoon that used for his device, and then the senior piss on it striking him with electricity. What a way to introduce the character, it's truly hilarious and surely will amuse the audience.
Another hilarious scene is when Rancho criticize the chancellor of the university's teaching methods. The chancellor Viru Sahastrebuddhe or commonly called Mr. Virus then fed up by anger dragging Rancho to a class, stopped the current teacher that teach in the class and angrily command Rancho to teach the class. A second of silence occurred, then he began grabbing a book and write the words ""Farhanitrate Preajulation"" on the chalkboard, he then asked the class including Mr. Virus to find the meaning of the words in 30 seconds. After all of the class skimmed through the books also Mr. Virus, they couldn't find any definition about the words. And it turns out that the words ""Farhanitrate Preajulation"" has no real meaning and it's only his friends name ""Farhan"" and Raju"", all of the class filled with laughter accept Mr. Virus which he is irritated and asked the class to shut up.
To sum, the movie is great and highly recommended to the one who really loves comedy / drama movies. Although it may be not as fun reading it, the movie scenes is more funnier when watching it directly by seeing the pictures, scenery and ambiance, It is surely worth the time to watch in leisure.",

752,11 March 2021,cliantadahayu,9, no more 3 idiots such as this 3 genius :),"Everything in this movie is presented blatantly from the critics to the pure emotions. Making it a rollercoaster ride of explosive emotions. From my perspective, this is a uniques characteristic to make the movie 3 Idiots a bit more appealing to the masses through empathy and inspiration as well as hard thinkers audience through its critique, I would say it is pretty messy due to the rollercoaster of emotions (and literally scenes) and might be too tiring for some.
1. Unrealistic standards of academics generalized by the school/country are very harmful if not deadly
Critiques towards India's education system is a center idea throughout the film. The unrealistics standard of academics generalized by the school nor country are binding kids only to focus and compete on academics instead of supporting and guiding them in their passion. This idea of ""good grades are mandatory practices of teaching kids to compete"" is very harmful mentally and physically. Like Farhan and Raju or even Chathur who study because they want to succeed and have good grades (for themselves and family) not for the sake of curiosity and knowledge. In extreme cases, as shown in the movie, pressure from strict teacher and lack of empathy in order to fulfill the curriculum and system can lead to suicide or suicide attempt of the students. Of course, parents can be the reason too
2. A true friend would risk everything for the sake of them, much like a soulmate
If we were to say that friends are those who spare time with us, having fun, study together, sharing stories, etc. it's correct, but true friends are always by our side in every situation. Not only at the happy moments, just like when Farhan and Rancho always stand besides Raju in his suffering, vice versa. They would prioritize their friends who are in dire need with no hesitation and judgment nor payback.
3. Parents should encourage their kid in order to pursue their passion, no matter if its not a known occupation for how well it pays
This a recurring pattern throughout the movie, parents enrolling their children in ICE without knowing what their passion is (Farhan for example) note that most of the parents abide the mindset that a good school and good grades will ensure in a well pay job, this is mostly correlated to the economic factor of the family itself
4. Study because you want to learn, not to achieve success. The desire to learn and discover things is the main fuel for success internally and externally. Passion is important, more than judgements, money, nor power.
Rancho has boasted about this numerous times in order to enlighten the people around him. And fortunately it works wonders for Farhan, Raju, Pia and himself. Chathur did achieve great success and maybe being the smarty-pants is his style of doing things, he might not be as great as Rancho but he succeeded in his own way and that's what matters.
Now to dive deeper into the main character way of thinking and overall personality and how he carried the whole movie plot. Rancho follows the path of idealism (study for knowledge and not success, chase your passion, and other ideal motto) which in a way works to his advantage and uplift others to be the best version of themselves. While in a lot of ways I agree to his principles to some extent, I believe his ways of proving so is harmfully excessive. In order to enlighten somebody Rancho almost always degrade others (which can be seen in many scenes involving Chathur and the professors) to a worrying extent. This includes stealing, manipulation, embarrassment, and many more.
Rancho is someone I personally aspire to be. Although, people like me would not go as far, because unfortunately I am not gifted with such genius. Though his ways of doing things are highly questionable and unethical, he (literally) saves people's lives even those who are not close to him. His almost unrealistically positive personality that lights rooms, spun people into dancing, and a happy go lucky guy is sometimes balanced with his vulnerable side (which pop's up in a more emotional scene) towards people he cares for and that care for him. Though most of the time he looks and acts improper his genius mind is something not to be questioned, a few scenes will showcase just how quick-thinking and strong willed he is that is sure to 'wow!' our minds. Nevertheless, I aspire to be someone that becomes so proud of his friends achievements for their own benefits and not mine.",

754,12 March 2021,radenathaya,9, a masterpiece artwork!,"The movie is titled three idiots, directed by Rajkumar Hirani released on the 25th of December 2009 has a perplexing storyline of interpreting the world of love, education, and friendship. It achieved success as the highest-grossing Indian film in 2009 and collected 4.60 billion rupees at the box office because it presents a story that is so memorable as it shows us different ways to live life from different perspectives. The characters beautifully created by Rajkumar Hirani and embodied by outstanding actors make the film convey the moral of the story perfectly. The most important message is that it remains in the hearts of the audience.
The genre of this film combines romance and comedy. It makes the film even more enjoyable to watch and does not get bored quickly because even though the film has a deep meaning, it packaged very lightly, and the love story between roles that makes the film not only revolves around comedy. Even the words used are in the form of a comedy but have a powerful meaning. It subconsciously makes the film easier to convey because it is in simple and engaging language.
The actor Aamir khan wraps his role as Rancho very well. Even though his actions seem trivial, it opens up perspectives that have never been seen before and connected in life. His performance stole the show in this film. Especially the appearance of Ranganathan Madhavan as Farhan Qureshi and Sharman Joshi as Raju Rastogi makes a magnificent combination. Without these two great supporting actors, this film would not have achieved such a spectacular result.
This film is full of scenes that are very memorable for the audience. There was a scene that is no less memorable and has a strong message when Rancho, Raju, and Farhan on the stairs are drunk. Farhan and Raju complain to Rancho about why they can't get good grades even though they have tried. Moreover, Rancho said to Farhan that Rancho knows that Farhan's passion is not as an engineer but as a photographer and forced himself to become an engineer because of his parents' coercion. Raju is now the one to ask why he does not get good grades, even though he aspires to be an engineer without pressure from anyone. Then, Rancho replied that Raju carries too many burdens about his parents and sister. Rancho wanted Raju to focus on enjoying learning without thinking about those burdens because all of that affects the quality of his study, and he finally realized and pondered it. This scene is delivered well even though with an atmosphere that is not tense. The tone of the voice tends to be joking, but the message is consequential and very memorable.
In conclusion, the producer, director, writer, and everyone involved did an outstanding work portraying the wonderous world of love, education, and friendship. This film has reached success since it struck the highest-grossing Hindi film in 2009 and raised over 4.60 billion rupees in the box office.

If you're brainless and rotten, you won't understand it so don't watch it. I hope these many words are enough for this review. Thank you..",

Even for someone like me who is not a big fan of Indian movies with all of the dancing and singing, 3 Idiots are still enjoyable to a certain extent. There are few unrealistic scenes that I am baffled with, which unnerved me enough that I questioned why I even watch this movie, but once I braved it on, it's completely worth a couple cringy clips to watch the entirety of 3 Idiots.",

This film told the story of 3 engineering students (Rancho, Raju, Farhan) who looked stupid in front of their lecturers, even though they had potential. Rancho was a smart kid, but unfortunately, his university professors didn't realise his potential. The professor had a standard that where the only valid answers were from textbooks, and Rancho proved it otherwise. This taught us that if we only memorize the textbook but do not understand it, it will be the same as the case when Chatur was asked to appear as a student representative. He did not understand the difference between the words Chamatkar and Balatkar, which have very different meanings.
Rancho also taught us that learning is everywhere. When he was expelled from the class, he would look for another class and listened carefully. Heavy spoiler alert, Rancho's plot twist was the fact that it was not even his real name. His real name was Phunsukh Wandu, the son of a gardener from Rancho who is the same age as him. His curiosity about students made him go to school wearing Rancho's uniform. This explained a lot of his behaviour from the early scenes, where he freely entered any class to study.
Rancho's iconic quote 'all is well' is extremely catchy and excites us. Saying that sentence gives us the courage to face the problems we fear. Indeed, that sentence does not solve the problem but makes us think positively about things that have not occurred.
However, the quote from the 3 Idiots that is most memorable is ""Do what you love, not do what you do"". Farhan's dream was to be a wildlife photographer, which was very different from the university he chose, namely engineering. In the beginning, his parents didn't allow him to follow his passion. His parents thought that being an engineer was better than a photographer. An engineer salary is more than a wildlife photographer. However, Farhan managed to convince his father that he wanted a wildlife photographer. His father supported his passion by asking how much a good photographer's camera is, is it worth the laptop he just bought. Parents will always support their children. Indeed, if there are some differences it will take a little time to deal with them, but the parents will understand, eventually.
The scene that stood out to me the most amongst other quite memorable clips was when Rancho fixed Joy's innovative helicopter that he threw away after Viru Sahastrabudhhe, their notoriously stuck up professor refused to give him more time to finish his project. Rancho took it out of the trash, and fixed it if only to cheer Joy up; never mind that he and his friends had tons of examinations and projects due as well. This theme carried over the next few minutes, to the point where they were all singing and dancing cheerfully when Rancho flew the mini helicopter up to Joy's room, where they discovered Joy's already stiff body. Joy could not take any more pressure, both from his professor and from his father who was extremely excited for his graduation that was cancelled by phone by Viru. It was a tragedy, and I would not sugar coat it. The most heartbreaking thing was the moment when you realise that Joy had not even seen his invention working like he meant for it to be.
Joy's suicide shocked me. It was without warning and almost completely unexpected if it weren't for the foreshadowing that you wouldn't completely understand until you watch it until that scene. This happens countless times every day in every country, as was evidenced by Rancho's confrontation with Viru where he brought up the statistic of suicide rate. This is real, even to this day and age. 3 Idiots managed to bring up this topic, not in the most sensitive way, but it represented the issue well enough.
Overall, as I stated in the beginning, this movie is enjoyable. It's humorous, it's the Indian musical type that some people enjoy, and it has wonderful moral value. The plot twists are amazing and unexpected, but the scenes before provided foreshadowing for those who watch it. It is almost 3 hours long, though, so take that into account and grab some snack before watching.",

This movie is based on people's minds that have been implanted so far in the education system that emphasizes students' obsession to have high grades.",
762,12 March 2021,salsafdp,9, 3 Idiots Review,"We will review a film called ""3 idiots"" with a duration of nearly three hours. The film tells the story of the friendship of three people who meet at the university named Farhan, Raju, and Rancho. At the beginning of the film, the stewardess' acting when Farhan fell was not deep enough in his role, it looked less natural. The film combined with the video clip makes it different from the usual films. Then, some scenes include comedy and funny things that make it less monotonous or boring. After that, many messages and implicit moral matters contained in the film were packaged with a relaxed and light disposition (comedy) which was also closely related to social life. The moral message is:
1. Life will still go the way, must have a ""compete or die"" attitude.
The point is to live life with a competitive nature, because if not then other people will follow us more advanced and we will be left behind with them. But it must be according to the portion and ability of each individual.
2. Respect time and be productive.
Make the best use of the time you have and as much as possible. Furthermore, time assistance so that the activities or activities carried out are of quality and productive every day.
3. An exam or academic system with a competitive attitude will make students depressed.
With so many assignments, projects, exams, it does not make students develop themselves but instead makes them stressed and depressed because they are like being turned into robots by the lecturers. Students must understand the lecturer, but on the one hand, the lecturer must also understand the position of the student. Not only physically tired, but mental problems are also very influential such as depression, fear, crisis, and others.
4. Choosing a major and your goals must be following your own wishes.
If parents go to school and determine that their child should be a doctor, they have to get good grades, and so on, it will only make the child feel burdened and under pressure. Must be following the children's interests, abilities, and talents. Don't let them go to this department because their parents, during college, there will only be stress, depression, disappointment, and regret in the child's mind.
5. Don't just want to graduate to work but to raise your soul.
The meaning of the sentence above is realistic. It is possible because everyone needs money but the goal of graduating from university is not only that but to make a wider perspective, think openly and critically, increase experience and insight.
Overall the film was very insightful and thought-provoking to those who watched it. There are many positive values contained that we can implement and apply to our daily life.",
763,17 March 2021,ariefmusabintangxipa,9, Pretty good,"3 idiots is a story critiquing the labor-like education system and competitive mindset in education. The main character supposedly represents the writer's voice who critics the system, but the interesting thing about it is that the story is told in a second person perspective by the main character's friend.
The progression of the story is also really good. The intro started with 2 of the ""idiots"" in a hurry after hearing news from an old colleague about the whereabouts of the third idiot ""Roncho"" who apparently has been missing. It made me wonder who is Roncho and why are they so excited to meet him again.
Then it goes to a flashback to how 2 of these friends met Roncho, the story is told in a flashback-present type way. Turns out this Roncho guy is a likeable person, and so a concern emerges... How did he went missing? And basically that straps you in for the ride, and it made sure you stay strapped in for the rest of it.
It had funny moments and emotional moments mixed in there, very well-paced too. Although, there is one thing that I'm not a fan of, the musicals. I think it would've been better off without any musicals, it comes off more as fillers more than anything. There's one particular moment that fells off to me. The part when they finished that guy's drone project and started flying it to his room while singing, only to reveal he was dead... on a noose, then cut to full silent.
Other than that the show is a 9/10 for me. Enjoyed the funny bits, Teared for the sad moments, Gasped for the twists. The moral of the story is clear, do not be bound by society, don't sweat too much about the future, and do what you love.",
