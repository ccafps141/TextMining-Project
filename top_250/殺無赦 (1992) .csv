0,15 March 2011,hitchcockthelegend,10, That's right. I'm just a fella now. I ain't no different than anyone else no more.,"William Munny (Clint Eastwood taking the lead and directing the piece) is an old and retired gunman whose past misdemeanours would make the devil himself seem tame. Widowed and struggling to raise his two children on a paltry farm, he's tempted out of retirement for one last pay dirt job, the consequence of which provides violence - both physically and of the soul.",/
1,9 March 2018,Fella_shibby,10, This aint just a great western. Its an incredible movie with an awesome star cast n superb performances.,"Saw this in the late nineties on a vhs n revisted umpteenth number of times. Own a dvd of it.
Jus revisited few days back on a blu ray.
Back in those days, my grandpop was excited to see both his fav film stars, Eastwood n Hackman in the same film. The cast is awesomely strong. Eastwood, Hackman n Freeman.
This aint just a great Western. Its a great movie with awesome characters.
Eastwood playing a tough guy who has killed women and children in the past but trying to lead a decent honest life with his kids on a farm. He has become more weaker with age. His farm is going thru a loss n he is pulled into his darker side once again.
On the other side v have Hackman as a sheriff whos against people carrying guns in his town.
He is a bit autocratic n sadist when meting out punishment.
We have Freeman as Eastwood's old pal who during a shootout acknowledges that he aint no ruthless anymore.
All the performances r top notch.
Eastwood's direction is truly mesmerizing from opening shot n the editing top notch. The one liners are also memorable. Cinematography by Jack N Green is wonderful.
The film begins and ends with a beautiful wide shot, Eastwood standing at the grave near a tree, with a sunset in the background.
As a fan of Eastwood n western genre, i owed it myself to write a review of this film.",r
2,19 February 2007,jluis1984,10, Masterpiece,"Ford, Hawks, Leone, Peckinpah, all of them big names who have defined the Western genre in one way or another across the history of cinema, transforming what started as low-budget action films into an art itself where the American Old West served as setting for tales of mythical heroism, classic tragedies, and legendary adventures. Actor and Director Clint Eastwood is probably one of the most knowledgeable artists about the Western genre, as his acting career began as the legendary ""Man With No Name"" in the Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns of the 60s. As a director, he somewhat continued this legacy through movies like ""High Plains Drifter"" and ""Pale Rider"", but finally in 1992, Eastwood released what many consider his final ode to the Western, and his ultimate masterpiece of the genre: ""Unforgiven"", an epic saga about the deconstruction of the Western myths.",e
3,6 June 2000,cathyyoung1,9, Unforgettable,"""Unforgiven"" may well be Clint Eastwood's greatest triumph as an actor and director.  In this grim, dark, and yet strangely beautiful story of former gunslinger William Munny (Eastwood), who comes out of retirement for one last job, Eastwood deliberately sets out to demystify the old West.  This is evident in the conversations between Munny and the Schofield Kid (Jaimze Wolvett), who has a romanticized image of the old-time gunfighters, and between sheriff Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) and hack journalist W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek).  Yet the ""demythologizing"" message doesn't feel forced; it is woven effortlessly into a gripping story that powerfully conveys the human cost of violence.",v
4,29 November 2005,Smells_Like_Cheese,8, A classic feel of Western with the added brilliance of Clint Eastwood and an equally strong cast,"I have heard quite a bit for ""Unforgiven"", also I want to seen all the best pictures from the 90's. I was also excited to see Morgan Freeman in the cast, so I know now that ""Million Dollar Baby"" was not Clint and Morgan's first experience together. They work so well as a team and bring nothing but sheer entertainment and charm to movies.",i
5,24 March 2009,bkoganbing,9, Notoriously Vicious And Intemperate Disposition,"With all the fine westerns that have come out in the history of film, Unforgiven is only the third one to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Following in the steps of Cimarron and Dances With Wolves, Unforgiven finally got Clint Eastwood the Oscar recognition for one of film's great icons. ",e
6,24 November 2016,Leofwine_draca,9," Reflective, contemplative revenge western is a real treat","There's little to say about this supreme western that hasn't been said already, but I'll try anyway. It's a spellbinding film, and nothing like what you'd expect from the rest of Eastwood's career. This turns out to be both an ode to a dying genre (the central characters are old and regretful) and a film with a powerful, anti-violence moral. Eastwood is at the top of his game both in terms of his screen presence (never has he played such a fragile, human character in a western) and as a director. This is one of the most beautiful westerns I've ever seen, with extraordinary lovely landscape shots which look fine when played in high definition.",w
7,7 June 2007,erostew,10, A Fitting End,There may never be another real western. Clint appears to be done with the genre and there really isn't anyone else I can think of that can do it Properly. Sergio Leone is gone. William Wellman is gone. Sam Peckinpah is gone. John Huston is gone. John Ford is gone. Howard Hawks is gone.,/
8,30 January 1999,Kaserynofthegyre,9, Eastwood & Hackman shine,"Unforgiven is about as far from the fantasy mythos of A Fistful of Dollars as Clint Eastwood could get.  No pin-point accuracy with 19th century technology, no desire to 'play fair' and face the enemy on even terms.  If you can shoot him in the back...then do it.",r

10,6 February 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10," In my opinion, Clint Eastwood's best movie...","Not only that but one of the best of the western genre. Unforgiven is simply brilliant. Clint Eastwood's direction is superb, and he is also exemplary in a suitably world-weary role. There is also some brilliant support playing, not only from Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris, but also especially from Gene Hackman.",2
11,11 January 2014,SnoopyStyle,9, Legendary,"It's 1880 Big Whisky, Wyoming. A cowboy slices up a whore's face. Sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman) together with greedy saloon owner agree to a fine of a few horses with not even a whipping. Strawberry Alice (Frances Fisher) is outraged, and pool together a reward for killing the two cowboys. The bounty attracts every killer around including English Bob (Richard Harris). It also attracts The Schofield Kid. He contacts William Munny (Clint Eastwood) who reunites with Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman). Together the three men travel to collect the reward.",4
12,23 September 2009,Hitchcoc,8, Sickness and Death,"I just felt awful after seeing this film. I had that same feeling after watching Taxi Driver and Deliverance. There is never a bright light anywhere. We begin with Eastwood's character visiting his wife's grave. He is a sad, defeated man. His life has been given over to violence and the one person who has salvaged some of it is now dead. Enter a young gunslinger who doesn't know anything about killing and what is involved in it. He is on his way to kill a couple cowboys who were responsible for the maiming of a prostitute. Eastwood falls to the need to feed his little children because his hogs are sick and bad times are on the way. He engages his old friend played by Morgan Freeman and get the bunch of them in way over their heads. If there is a more complete villain than Gene Hackman in all of film, I'm not sure who it is. He is killing machine who is in control of his empire. He lives on the fear of others. He brutalizes people and then grins. He is working on a house, hoping to sit down and enjoy the sunsets at some point. But you don't mess with him. Everyone understands that and they fall in line. Ultimately this movie is about the price of killing. Despite his declining years, Eastwood has had a stomach full of it and when his friend is brutalized by Hackman, well, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. It's just that it brings on the darkest feelings in the soul. Maybe that's the point.",8
13,23 March 2019,NpMoviez,10, Incredible!,"For me, it is the greatest Revisionist Western ever made. As per Westerns in general, this is my second most favorite Western of all times, the first one being (obviously) ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" (1966). Besides this, this movie is one of the most worthy ""Best Picture"" recipient as well as one of the most worthy ""Best Director"" recipient in the history of Academy Awards.",6
14,22 July 2018,Tweekums,10, Possibly Clint Eastward's most impressive western,"After a couple of drunken cowboys cut up a prostitute in the town of Big Whiskey, Wyoming Sheriff 'Little Bill' Daggett decrees that they must give the owner of the brothel a few horses as compensation for lost earnings... the other women do not think this is enough so combine their money and let it be known that they will pay $1,000 to anybody who kills the cowboys. A young man calling himself the 'Schofield Kid' hears of this and approaches retired gunslinger and general ne'er-do-well William Munny proposing that they kill the cowboys for the reward. Munny has renounced his wicked past, thanks to his late wife, but needs the money to raise his two children so reluctantly accepts. Along the way he picks up his old partner Ned Logan.",5
15,15 December 2012,ironhorse_iv,8, It is unforgiven if you haven't saw this movie yet,"Before Clint Eastwood was talking to chair, he was making good films like Unforgiven. Unforgiven is a uniquely different Western, at the time as it gave the audience the most realist example of how life was like in the Old West. A group of prostitutes in Big Whiskey, Wyoming, are looking for any bounty hunter to kill two cowboys who disfigured a woman's face. Sheriff Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman), is wanting to keep the town peaceful and is against any bounty hunters coming in. Little Bill had given the two men leniency, despite their crime. News about the reward reached Kansas, where a pig farmer William Munny (Clint Eastwood) is approach by the Schofield Kid, a boastful young man to collect the reward. Clint Eastwood is a great actor, who able to hide facts with his eyes, and his facial expression. Much of the charm of the first part of the movie is how unlikely he could be a bounty hunter, but he go on to do it because he's raising two children alone and his farm is failing. On the way, Munny's friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) joins in for the search of the cowboys. They weren't the first to make it to the town. Back in Wyoming, gunfighter English Bob (Richard Harris) arrive in Big Whiskey, also seeking the reward. Little Bill and his deputies savagely beat Bob, hoping to set an example for other would-be assassins. When Logan and Munny got the chance—they were able to kill one of the cowboy. It becomes apparent that Logan and Munny no longer have much stomach for murder. Logan tries to return home. Logan gets captured by the Sheriff's men and this is where the story gets intense. This is where we see how bad-ass Munny is. David Webb Peoples, adapter of both Twelve Monkeys and Blade Runner, wrote the screenplay. He wrote when Munny drinks whiskey, it's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The audience does truly find out whom Munny really about in the last ending scene. That was where it shined. The beat up up, pig farmer was urged by multiple consequences to take a drink and the monster erupted with horrific consequences. Mr. Hyde took a lot of prodding but his reputation was well founded and could been worse if he was the Hyde that shed all humanity. He still had a foot in his human side. There is a film noir feel to the film full of ambiguity and atmosphere. The dark Western deals frankly with the uglier aspects of violence, deep and steeped in morality. It was a perfect fit, hand for a glove. The screenplay is unique, written for Eastwood to direct. Still, the film realism is kind of distracting and depressing. It tends to break up the myth of the West. Unforgiven is a film that doesn't hold a candle to Sergio Leone's brilliant Dollars Trilogy in any way. Certainly, it's a classic Western, regardless of it not following the classic theme. There is something appealing to a film that takes an old concept and makes it up to modern standard. Everything about this movie is good, from direction to acting! Gene Hackman's acting is keyed to the film to work. The Sheriff was right. The only way to handle real criminals is to show them you are meaner and more ruthless than they are. Hackman did a perfect job of demonstrating the ""style' that all good law enforcement people ""should"" follow to actually get the job done effectively. Today's soft, limp wrist, politically correct cops pay a very heavy price when incorrectly believing that they can warn and make friends with bad guys; and the politicians could care less how much they or their families suffer. It finds it kind of surreal that Little Bill is painted the villain of the film. Willy tried to be a family man, Bill wanted to build a house. Bill killed one man (a mercenary) and Willy Munny killed six (most of them innocents). Any way you look at it there were no heroes in this film. Clint's acting is just bar none, and it is a movie that has characters so compelling, it makes you wonder about the nature of humanity. Everybody soon learns a harsh lesson about the price of vindictive bloodshed and the malleability of ideas like ""justice.""",8

17,5 September 2007,classicsoncall,10," ""I ain't like that anymore, Kid.""","There's a compelling scene in the movie where the scarred whore Delilah (Anna Levine) offers William Munny (Clint Eastwood) a 'free one', not from herself, but from one of the other girls. Munny's response has to do with the scars they both carry as a burden in their lives. For one brief moment, Delilah takes comfort in the fact that someone finds her beautiful after the savage attack that left her disfigured, and Munny realizes there are only just so many things he can hang on to before reverting back to his true nature, a grim, cold hearted killer.",/
18,19 January 2006,tjcbs,10, How the west was,"This film was a revelation, a western that DOESN'T LIE. The whole theme stripping away the mythology our culture has built around the west, scraping it away like the finish on a mirror and reveling the ugliness AND the humanity beneath. I was utterly convinced, both by the portrayal of the period and the reality of the characters. A large focus was its treatment of the subject of killing. The movie SHOWS US what it is like to kill a man, a stark stark contrast to the casual attitude taken by so many other westerns. We see what we already know, wild west or no, that killing is something that most people just aren't capable of. And yet the character of William Munny shows us that in spite of the mundanity he embodies in his later life, true evil still existed then as now, and every now and then, true heroism.",?
19,12 November 2004,sjwest,8, 'A Man With No Name' Becomes 'A Man With A Real Story'.,"Clint Eastwood's storytelling gives the western genre one of its most sublime story's. Gone is the trademark mysterious hero and in its place is an ex gunman who made his peace when he met his wife. Eastwood has transcended traditional entertainment to storytelling craftsmanship. He delivers rich characters with deep rooted problems inextricably linked to the villains of the story. Refusing to wither and die away, style has been perfectly adapted with age thus ensuring his maturation into a true Hollywood legend.",r
20,17 April 2005,murrayjp,9, Requiem for a Western,"Unforgiven will always be the last Western. No matter what comes after it, Tombstone, The Missing, or Wyatt Erp, Unforgiven has the final word. Not that I wouldn't characterize those films as Westerns, but the spirit of Unforgiven, from the opening shot of the house with the scrawny tree and lonely grave, to the end which returns there, is imbued with the finality of a spent genre. The feelings evoked are ambivalent and distant, much like the characters within Unforgiven itself. Perhaps Clint Eastwood's genius lies partially in that he doesn't allow for us to mourn. It wouldn't be western to cry because a story-form is over, it wouldn't be leather to empathize for a broken man who doesn't want your sympathy, it wouldn't be spurs to despair about the implacable and corrupt forces of life which turn men like William Munny into killers.

23,10 December 2004,whstrock,9, An old man reconnects with his wicked past,"I enjoy the transformation of Clint Eastwood's character throughout the movie. In the beginning he reluctantly becomes a gunfighter but as the movie progresses you see how he slides down the slippery slope of wickedness to become the cold-blooded killer needed for the task. Morgan Freeman's reaction to the transformation is well played also. Richard Harris' character is colorful as is his sidekick. Gene Hackman's sheriff is pleasantly atypical of the role. All these actors and their characters effectively leave the viewer with a myriad of directions from which the movie expertly entertains. If you are expecting anything like Clint's ""spaghetti westerns"" you will be disappointed. If you are looking for an excellent story with characters that all have varying degrees of wickedness, you will be satisfied when its all said and done.",=
24,14 May 2009,murtaza_mma,9, A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Truly Unforgettable,"Unforgiven is Clint Eastwood's tribute to his mentors, Sergio Leone and Don Siegel. Regarded by many as the last true Western, Unforgiven is truly unforgettable. Though, it being the last true Western is subject to qualification, but it definitely consummates the genre. In fact, it will easily make it to the top 10 of the decorated genre, a genre illuminated by greats like Ford, Wayne, Leone, Peckinpah, and Eastwood himself. ",t

Second only to John Wayne as the longest A-Lister to be on the A-list (although Tom Cruise just broke both of their records), Clint Eastwood was the man with no name. He didn't want to come to your town. You forced him to. He didn't want to be the hero. It was forced upon him. Same in this movie.

Clint has dabbled in ""Shane"". In ""Pale Rider"" he used the mysterious stranger, in which he saves a working community by means that are practically supernatural.

28,19 October 2003,MovieAddict2016,8," The Good, the Bad and the Unforgiven...","Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" is a nod to the old spaghetti westerns from the sixties and seventies, such as ""The Dollars Trilogy"" by Sergio Leone, the very films that made Eastwood a major Hollywood player. But this one is more touchy than the others--it features a character who may be The Man with No Name (a.k.a. Blondie) thirty years after we saw him ride away at the end of ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" This particular man is filled with guilt trailing him from his past, when he was a gunslinging drunkard made infamous throughout the west as a brutal killer. Now he's older and a retired cowboy--he lives with his two children in the middle of nowhere as a farmer. His name is William Munny.",r

Excepting the final shootout, this representation omits the unshootable, the character that could walk through the volley of a dozen Gatling guns and survive.

30,29 August 2010,hnt_dnl,5, Very flawed Eastwood film,"I'm a huge fan of ""early"" Clint Eastwood (you can see by some of my other reviews) and have seen UNFORGIVEN (1992) several times, but I just can't completely get into this film and don't think it's a masterpiece, as with several of his other films that he has starred in and/or directed (A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, DIRTY HARRY, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, and the criminally underrated elegiac A PERFECT WORLD). Also, there are several other ""lesser"" other Eastwood works that I'd pop into the DVD player before this one, ones that I find to be provocative, immensely entertaining, or re-watchable or all of the above (HANG EM HIGH, THE GAUNTLET, THE ENFORCER, SUDDEN IMPACT, TIGHTROPE).",
31,18 November 2012,Theo Robertson,6, Overlong Unfocused Anti-Western,"It's interesting that when UNFORGIVEN was released every review show that showed an excerpt would would always show the same clip - the climax where Clint Eastwood's grizzled anti-hero walks in to the saloon and informs Gene Hackman "" I've killed everything that's walked and crawled and now i've come to kill you little Bill "" . This hooks the audience in to thinking they're going to be watching one of these old school Westerns where convention dictates if you want to survive then you've got to be quick on the draw. This is entirely misleading because UNFORGIVEN is very much an anti-western , something of an antidote to the syrupy feel-good DANCES WITH WOLVES which kick started a mini boom of the Western genre. Both films are at a polar opposite in most ways but share a common ground in that they're both films that won the Oscar for best pictures. They also share the common ground that they're overlong ",

A magnificent, perfect and virtuoso piece of filmmaking, which highly deserved to win the Oscar in the four major categories of Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood, Best Supporting Actor for Gene Hackman and Best Film Editing for Joel Cox.

Before reappearing in San Francisco, where he wrote another glorious chapter of life with his two grown-up children. Then come the end credits. Still in shock, we cannot help but draw a parallel with a certain Mr. Harry Callahan, who might well be the grandson of Bill Munny.

Grovin up whit western movies, I would have to say that unforgiven is about whole new genre among western movies. Unforgiven is really a true statement of man's brutality and what he ""or"" she is capable of. Religion,marriage,children, doesn't change ones true identity.

41,1 October 2018,cardsrock,10, A masterful meditation on the nature of violence,"Clint Eastwood masterfully deconstructs the American western with this stirring epic. Formerly a star of such westerns, Eastwood confronts the genre's hallmarks and asks us to consider moral ambiguity in relation to violence. There is no obvious good and evil, only a gray area in which this film carves out its rich story. Eastwood and Hackman shine in their roles as the morally ambiguous focal points. For anyone who considers westerns to be shoot-em-ups lacking any real substance, consider this touching, complex look at the Old West. Eastwood closes the book on the western as the 20th century knew it in supreme fashion.",

'Unforgiven (1992)' is a sombre and reflexive piece that isn't afraid to be morally complex and presents all its characters, along with their callous acts of violence, with an objective honesty so that the viewer can draw their own conclusions about who is 'right' and whether violence is ever an appropriate response. It's a refreshingly intelligent picture that never spells anything out and is all the more compelling for it, easily becoming one of the most emotionally investing and riveting films in its genre.

52,20 April 2012,drqshadow-reviews,4," Eastwood's Spacey, Vacant Western Makes Shockingly Slow Progress","Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman play two retired wild west bounty hunters, back in their saddles to chase one last bounty after decades of silence. Agonizingly slow, its two leads take their sweet time collecting their belongings, mounting their horses and trotting at a leisurely pace across state lines, sharing less than a few sentences along the way. We gather that Eastwood was a shady character in his day, reformed by the love of a deceased wife, but he seems more like a caged animal than a redeemed spirit and we're never given much reason to pull for him despite the presumed change of heart. Though his beloved bride's spirit lives on in the couple's two young children, he barely acknowledges their presence before leaving them on their own for a month to randomly hunt a new bounty. Freeman tries to drag some character development out of him on the trail, but Eastwood holds onto it with an icy grip and piercing eyes, and there we sit for the rest of the picture. Gene Hackman is noteworthy for his portrayal of a smarmy, cocky town sheriff with a chip on his shoulder, but on every other count this is a western that misses with each squeeze of the trigger. Despite a few beautiful panoramas, the world feels stiflingly tight and compressed. Outside of Hackman, there's no fire and passion in the cast, even when Eastwood turns the page and transgresses to his wilder young persona. Finally, the atmosphere, crucial to all films of the genre, feels too clean and polished where it should be gritty and dirty. Much as I would have loved to see Clint don that familiar parka and revisit the days of his Sergio Leon sunrise, it's just not happening here.",
53,23 September 2005,RanchoTuVu,9, both sides of the gun,"A violent story of revenge set in the cold and inhospitable town of Big Whiskey, Wyoming, with touches of the earlier High Plains Drifter, it revolves around the disfigurement of a prostitute and the inability to find justice through the law. It becomes quite a convoluted story, given each of the characters backgrounds and personalities. The traditional good guy, the sheriff, is here a sadistic monster, while what was always portrayed as the bad guys, hired killers, are now wearing the white hats. The girls in the brothel have to pool their money in order to pay for the killing of the men responsible. Paying proves to be the easiest part while carrying out the mission makes a repeat offender of one of the men, and a first time killer of the other while the third, who never really did anything to deserve it, is captured and tortured to death. At that point the operation takes on its own life and leads to a final scene in the same darkened saloon where the girl was attacked. Eastwood makes it all very apt to happen in the stark and brutal environment he creates with great camera, acting, and music.",
54,17 November 2010,mnpollio,4, Overlong revisionist western,"Clint Eastwood's much-ballyhooed revisionist western became the first western in decades to win a Best Picture Oscar, but most viewers will probably wonder why. The film is beautifully photographed, but over-rated, overwrought and over-populated with extraneous characters that pad out the film's already questionable running time given its flimsy story. The film opens with a puzzling on screen typescript that ultimately becomes laughable as it has nothing whatsoever to do with the story and discusses a woman that never appears in the film or is really even discussed. Eastwood trots out his old stock character of the tired gunslinger prodded back into action by young whippersnapper Jaimz Woolvet to accept the commission set out by a group of prostitutes in Big Whiskey to avenge the disfigurement of one of their own by a local ruffian. Corrupt sheriff Gene Hackman is not too keen on the idea of cavalcades of gunslingers parading through town and naturally becomes an obstacle for Eastwood. Truthfully, this story has been done to death, and the only thing Eastwood really brings to the table is making his character aged and the entire tone of the film melancholy to the point of inducing sleep. None of the ""action"" scenes are especially suspenseful and there are so many characters that are just simply not needed. I enjoy Richard Harris, but his participation in this film is pointless. Morgan Freeman seems on hand only because Eastwood likes to stack the cast with older actors and because someone needs to die in order for him to go all ""man with no name"" on everyone. The women - who one would think should hold some sway over the film - are relatively interchangeable and given little screen time. Woolvett is little more than an irritant and is given short shrift. Eastwood looks and acts pale and decrepit. Only Hackman seems aware that he is in a film and there needs to be some energy or life to resuscitate the audience watching. The conclusion is predictable and most viewers will have little, if any, emotional stake in the outcome. A beautiful looking waxwork of a film, which copped Eastwood his first of two completely undeserved director Oscars. With all due respect McCabe and Mrs. Miller did this revisionist western thing much better more than a decade earlier and Eastwood's film merely comes across as a poor copy.",

Making it become larger than life are the actors in this movie which is a good thing because we are entertained and that is what this is all about. I personally thought it dragged a little in the beginning and it ended too abruptly. However, any critique is offset by the good time that comes from watching. Westerns always have the same premise i.e. my gun, my pony and me. After that, add a woman, some gunfights and revenge here and there and it captures us as it should. This movie serves up ""comeuppance in large portions. You just can wait to see certain people in this movie get what is coming to them. Here, the movie gives closure and satisfaction but could have gone the distance and milked it more. The West was a colorful but dangerous place and the proof of that was that many back East loved hearing the tales of what was happening out West. It was the place of adventure, discovery and where men still made their own rules. That was all soon to end as we well know taking with it the Indians, open ranges, the buffalo, and excitement of exploring the unknown. Civilization has a way of taming and dumbing down even the most ornery of characters and situations. The West we see in the movies is all that is left of it.

70,26 March 2010,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10, A masterpiece in nuance,"This is probably Eastwood's best, as far as both directing and starring. The depth and the lack of black and white or judgment are astonishing. Every single character is well-written, credible, developed thoroughly and a *human being*. Not one of them is limited to only one side to their personality, everyone is flawed... the antagonist is arguably not a ""bad guy"", and you can get behind him and see things his way. This does not present us with right and wrong, it offers differing points of view, and allows the audience to decide for ourselves what we think. Food for thought, not a raised index finger. The script comes from the man who would later give us Twelve Monkeys and Soldier(no, it wasn't brilliant, but that wasn't his fault, Webb Peoples gave them a great start-off point, blame Paul W.S. Anderson), and the plot is relatively simple and easy to follow(not to be confused with predictable), so that the focus can be put on exploring the people. This portrait of the fictional William Munny is entirely unforgettable, immensely insightful and ultimately quite tragic. The level of realism that is present in every area of this is impeccable(the one thing I can think of that strains credulity is the presence of an African-American who isn't a slave, but with how incredible Freeman's performance is, I can forgive it), sets, costumes, dialog, language, relationships, etc. This has excellent and spot-on acting all the way; heck, even the kids aren't too bad. The editing and cinematography are amazing, and this holds several gorgeous and memorable images. This is not about action, it's an engaging drama set in the Wild West. With that said, there is definitely thick tension, as well as exciting scenes in this(and they neither are, nor feel, out of place in the least). There is a lot of brutal, bloody and unpleasant violence, a bit of disturbing content, occasional swearing and a little sexuality and references to such in this. I recommend this warmly to everyone mature enough to handle and appreciate it. 10/10",

76,2 March 2008,moonspinner55,6," Mangy scoundrels, shaky gunslingers, and one vicious sheriff...","Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning western ""Unforgiven"" is said by some to be an elegy to the genre, an honest and probing examination of killing. The murders in the film spring from injustice and lawlessness, and while the picture certainly has a deep texture and rich performances, it isn't always graceful--nor original--though still one of the finest westerns of the last twenty years. Two cowboys in a small Wyoming town in the 1880s are responsible for the slashing of a young prostitute; they're let off easy by the corrupt, power-mad sheriff, causing the ladies of the brothel to pull their resources and put up a bounty on the men. Eastwood plays an ex-gunslinger turned pig-rancher who, along with an aged partner and a cocky, nearsighted kid, takes up the task of killing the men for the money, not counting on crossing paths with the town sheriff and his dedicated deputies. The film isn't multi-layered, and it isn't an allegory exactly, although Eastwood and screenwriter David Webb Peoples do tease the moral issue, as well as showing us how strenuous (physically and mentally) it is to kill another human being. The resulting picture is intriguing, absorbing (after a somewhat rocky start) and, finally, cathartic. The weak dialogue is an obstacle: Peoples has come up with an arresting narrative, but his trash talk is flabby--and things gets even worse with the buddy-isms (Morgan Freeman to widower Eastwood: ""Do you use your hand?""). As another mercenary, Richard Harris has a strong supporting bit, yet it's his entrance (and exit) that allows sheriff Gene Hackman to really flourish as the villain of the piece. Oscar-winner Hackman gets down to grit of this cold-hearted man (with the meanest steely eyes), yet this sheriff is also a clod, a fool living in a leaky house. As director, Clint Eastwood doesn't do much out of the ordinary (and one has to wonder about those two youngsters left alone back at the ranch), but visually the picture looks adept and is paced well (but I could have done without the heart-to-hearts around the campfire, as well as all the rain). As the winner of the Best Picture Oscar, it revitalized the craving for new-fangled, hard-bitten westerns...and its individual success bears the brunt of many painful imitations. **1/2 from ****",

Eastwood's directing, for which he also won an Oscar, is impeccable, and as far as his character and acting are concerned, I had the impression that I was watching the fourth sequel to the trilogy. Apart from playing practically the same character, improved by age and experience, this is also a revisionist or anti-western, even more serious and darker than Leone's. The film tells the story of a middle-aged widower and father of two small children, once an unscrupulous gunslinger with a scary reputation, who, after more than a decade of peaceful farming, embarks on another, last bounty hunt, questioning his own life and personality while karma collects old debts. Eastwood was also nominated for the Best Actor in a Leading Role, but this Oscar deservedly went into the hands of Al Pacino for ""The Scent of a Woman"". Morgan Freeman played his partner expectedly well, and Gene Hackman took the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, the role of a local sheriff trying to stop them.

When he received a screenplay for an independent Italian production called The Magnificent Stranger (at the time), little did he know that it would make him a big star. The director on this project was a man by the name of Sergio Leone, who is mentioned towards the end of the credits of Unforgiven. Unforgiven is a tribute of sorts to Leone's style of direction. Before Sergio Leone hit the American markets, Westerns had fallen into cliché, and had stagnated so much that they were no longer taken seriously. Kind of like almost everything produced by the MPAA and its studios today, but with a smaller price tag. Unforgiven, from start to finish, is a tribute to Sergio Leone's unconventional direction and style of story.

92,28 October 2009,GeneSiskel,4," I Was a Friend of John Ford, and You, Sir, Are No John Ford","And now for another point of view: I didn't like it. I didn't finish it in fact. I know that ""Unforgiven"" is ranked by some as one of the greatest Westerns ever made. I know that it stars and was directed by Clint Eastwood, one of the icons of American cinema. I know that it won a bunch of Oscars. Still, I didn't like it. I don't like Westerns, and that's clearly a matter of taste, but I also don't admire Eastwood's acting. He is not and never has been a leading man. He is no Burt Lancaster, no Paul Newman, no John Wayne. In this film alone he is dwarfed by Richard Harris and Gene Hackman; they are both actors. No, Eastwood is a tall guy with a reedy voice who usually plays tough guys. Here he plays a retired tough guy. When I see him on screen, I see a man laboring at his acting. Then there's the anti-Western Western plot. It is too obviously intended to inject contemporary values -- a respect for the role of women, blacks, native Americans, and single parents; a disrespect for violence and drinking; the wholesomeness that comes with marriage, including interracial marriage, and small adorable children -- into a century in which those values weren't necessarily accepted, at least in these ways. By promoting those values, the movie comes across as mannered, if not preachy. Then there are the hoary movie stereotypes -- prostitutes with hearts of gold, the kid who can't shoot straight, the city slicker new to the wild West, the sage brush shimmering on a summer afternoon with a musical accompaniment in major chords. Finally there is the pacing of Eastwood's direction. I gave up after an hour. Eastwood was still riding north, chatting with Morgan Freeman and the kid who couldn't shoot straight, sixty minutes after the plot driven by the slashing of a prostitute was set in motion. It was way too slow. Somebody had to find these elements uncompelling. I am afraid it was me.",
93,15 October 2006,Jakealope,5, Im-Morality Tale Posing as Heavy,"I never understood why this film was billed as and considered by so many to be a morality tale. It is about a bad man, 'Bill' Munny, a killer, who settled down for a few years when he got married, had a couple of kids and tried to lead a normal farmers life in the 1880's West. Then his wife died. One day, one of his old buddies, Ned Logan, comes to him with a proposition. A couple of cowboys beat up and scarred a whore in some remote archetypal western town. Even then, one of the cowboys was almost a spectator to the crime and even tried to restrain his friend. The local sheriff, Little Bill Daggett, then brutally horse whipped the two men in public and made them pay compensation to the whore. But that was not good enough for the other whores, who chipped in to hire a hit man to do the two in. Natch, this was an attraction to Mr. Muney, who promptly abandons his farm and two kids to go out and resume his murderous ways with his old fellow criminal, Ned Logan, and a wanna-be Billy the Kid, The Schofield Kid.",

113,19 August 2017,nzswanny,10, The subtle decay of a killer.,"Unforgiven, a film directed by Clint Eastwood, holds a dark, brooding atmosphere that instead of holding a glamorizing gloom in the atmosphere of the movie it seems to be a regretful and honest gloom which isn't common with a lot of movies, and this subtle little thing is what makes Unforgiven one of the better films you will watch in your life. William Munny decays through his age as he reflects as a farmer on his regretful, haunting, violent past and whether or not he has changed or not, a cold-blooded killer that used to kill women and children for the sake of cruelty. In this film, William Munny one day has a person named as the Schofield kid entering his farm and asking him to go with him to achieve a 1,000$ reward, but in order to achieve that award the Schofield kid has to kill two cowboys named Quick Mike and ""Davey-Boy"" Bunting because of them disfiguring a prostitute. William is then told by the Schofield kid that the reason why he was being asked to help him was because of the rumour the Schofield kid heard about him being a cold-blooded killer, but William is convinced that he is not the same person as he was and refuses to help him. But some days later as the thought of returning to his old ways crosses his mind, William decides to achieve the reward of 1,000$ with the Schofield kid and sets off on his horse to find him, and along with him he brings an old partner named Ned Logan in order to achieve the reward. But as William Munny goes in the process of achieving it, he realizes his haunting decay as he sees disturbing hallucinations and remembers innocent people that he murdered inconsiderably, and so William dissolves a recognized darkness into his soul that slowly increases as the film goes along.",

115,20 December 2006,bowtiecinema,1, Who ever gave this film an Oscar is unforgivable!!!!,"This movie would not be half as atrocious as it was if it hadn't won 4 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor for Gene Hackman, and Best Editing. Simply put, this movie is unforgivably bad. It had no umph behind its story, a retard behind the typewriter, and one of the least talented actors of all time manning the helm. The content of the film could've been powerfully put together as a means to expose the horrors of the true old west, as opposed to the many western before who glorified it. But the way Unforgiven is woven together leaves no room for the audience to admit the tragedy of the situations happening on screen or even be entertained and caught up in the magic of a western. Instead the audience is horrified by the tastelessness of the dialog, sexual references and violence. This film has no purpose. It's not entertaining, exciting, compelling, tragic, or even believable. I'm sure something like this did actually happen in the old west, but to tell you the truth, I believe more in the story told in the previous movie I critiqued. The cinematography (which was nominated for an Academy Award, but thankfully didn't win) was a complete atrocity! I believe I saw one good shot in the entire two hours that I suffered through this film. If you're famous and you want to make a movie, I have no problem with that. But when industry praises a film unjustly, while putting brilliant work down or at least putting it in the background, the cruelty of this world surfaces. Such brilliant work as Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men was not even allowed one win, even though it was nominated in 3 of the categories that Unforgiven won (including Gene Hackman winning against Jack Nicholson). Even worse is that Robert Redford's greatest film, A River Runs Through It, wasn't even in the running. I'm remembering back to one of my previous revues of director Clint Eastwood's Bronco Billy (another flop in my book) when I say that again this film isn't dramatic enough to work. I would have given this movie a quarter point higher in my rating if it wasn't held up as something so great, but no more sympathy from me. Clint Eastwood, you do a better job in the cheesy Spaghetti Westerns from Sergio Leone; they at least can entertain.",
116,20 March 2011,eyesour,4, Did Pa used to kill folks?,"Weirdly ambivalent, slightly incoherent 1992 story.

Bits and pieces from ""Liberty Valance"", ""A Fistful of Dollars"", ""Ride the High Country"", ""Lawman"", ""Young Guns"", even a touch of ""Badlands"" and ""Cat Ballou"", no less. A jug of whiskey greatly improves your target-shooting. A mash-up. One of the silly scenes happens early on, when Clint flounders around in his pig pen; and then can't get on his horse. What's he been doing for the last eleven years, since he stopped gunslinging? How has he been getting into town, or anywhere, except on horseback? Has he just been sitting in his shack with his two kids, for the last three years, since his wife died? There's a try at explaining it away. In any case, it's very badly shot and performed.",

This sequence sets the tone of what's to come, and proves the catalyst for the rest of the movie. No, Unforgiven is not the kind of wholesome, if somewhat violent entertainment that John Ford and Howard Hawks used to make. Nor is it the kind of stylish, ultraviolent shoot-em-up that Eastwood used to star in back in his younger days.

Around a rather poor and somewhat unconvincing story of a group of bar prostitutes trying to hire a killer to revenge the barbarous cut up of one of them by two cowboys, Clint Eastwood made a good western movie in technical and formal terms with a de luxe cast (himself, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman and Richard Harris). When I say a good movie I mean a good movie in terms of images, sequences, dialogues, acting and cut. It's of course a movie full of the usual violent and tough scenes since the main characters are violent and tough people who can easily kill other people for money or pleasure. Nevertheless this doesn't prevent some of them to show good human feelings, revealing even on some final scenes curious conscience problems. The general atmosphere is one of the lawlessness that was in force in the American West by mid-19th century where law was dictated by who could shoot first and faster. That atmosphere is well reproduced in this movie. The feminine element is here composed only by the group of the bar prostitutes who show often more human feelings than men.

The outlaw Josey Wales was a much better western and mirrored the same sentiment of a mans past catching up with him. Violent yes but we are lead to believe that they were violent times..cannot comment on that because I wasn't there.Gene Hackman is great as the violent sheriff trying to keep order in violent times and of course Clint makes a great cowboy but this movie lacks a little something for me. I also think that the men portrayed in this would worry too much about a prostitute who had a few scars on her face either..but that's irrelevant.

That Eastwood went under several aliases but was always calm, collected, deadly with the draw and ruggedly handsome. Here he is ragged and elderly; he tends to pigs, not to bounties, misfires from a few paces on a still tin can, and can barely mount his horse without a decent struggle.

145,8 March 2016,oOoBarracuda,6, Forgive me for not caring for Unforgiven,"Unforgiven places Clint Eastwood precisely in his element. I haven't even seen that many Clint Eastwood films, but I can say without a doubt this is his type of movie. The 1992 Best Picture winner also directed by Clint Eastwood is the Clint-essential (see what I did there?) western depicting a retired gunslinger who wants a new life, but is still needed for his particular set of skills. This precise role is one Clint has played time and time again, yet with each turn brings something new, yet very Eastwood to the role.",
146,4 April 2012,dworldeater,10, My favorite movie of all time.,"This is one critically acclaimed film that deserves all of the awards it received. Unforgiven also put Eastwood back on top after a few not so well received pictures that came out previous to this . This is not a typical western as the western period is not really romanticised here. There are no good guys ( at least in the traditional sense) either . This movie has a lot to say about violence and its lasting effects . Clint Eastwood does not play his usual man with no name type, but a flawed, complex character. This is rounded out with a powerhouse supporting cast with Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris .The tone of the film is dark and the direction and acting is rock solid. David Webb Peoples wrote a fantastic , original script and Eastwood made it work . Movies of this quality don't come along often and in my opinion William Munny is the character Clint was born to play.",

148,19 June 2017,HarlequeenStudio,10," ""It's a hell of a thing, killin' a man.""","All of this because of a prostitute?!? Yes, indeed. And that alone makes this film monumental. The film has an unusual pattern and breaks some of the unspoken rules of the genre: no one is cool and they all seem like a bunch of losers. The good guys and the bad guys get killed. When you look at the equally badass characters of Richard Harris, Gene Hackman and Clint Eastwood, you can't tell who will finally come out on top. Jaimz Woolvett and Morgan Freeman are more than just sidekicks. The prostitutes are hardly damsels in distress - they can fend for themselves (Frances Fisher as Strawberry Alice is far from sweet). And they don't just provide the amusement and/or body count. They are flesh and blood and no makeup. They are treated like human beings, as well. The men don't just exchange the bullets, but also emotions. Clint Eastwood's penchant for the lone gunmen and scars is evident here, too. The moral of the story: one scarred woman is worth 9 men (total body count).",

151,23 September 2005,jboothmillard,8, Unforgiven,"In 2020, it was the 90th birthday of the leading actor and Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated winning director Clint Eastwood (Play Misty for Me, High Plains Drifter, Million Dollar Baby, The Mule), to celebrate I watched many of his finest films, including this one. Basically, in 1880, in the town of Big Whiskey, Wyoming, prostitute Delilah Fitzgerald (Anna Thomson) makes an offhanded comment, and is brutally attacked and disfigured with a knife by two cowboys, Quick Mike (David Mucci) and Dave ""Davey-Boy"" Bunting (Rob Campbell). The women want Davey and Mike to hang, but local sheriff ""Little"" Bill Daggett (Oscar, BAFTA, and Golden Globe winning Gene Hackman) says they will be horse-whipped as punishment. Skinny is more concerned with potential loss of business, so Little Bill decrees the men will bring several horses as compensation. This outrages the women even more; they decide to offer a $1,000 reward to anyone who will kill the cowboys. In Hodgeman County, Kansas, on a pig farm, William Munny (Oscar nominated Clint Eastwood) is a former outlaw and murderer, he is now a repentant widower raising two children. A boastful young man calling himself the ""Schofield Kid"" (Jaimz Woolvett) visits the farm, wanting to recruit Munny to help him kill the cowboys and claim the reward. After initially declining, Munny recognises that his farm is failing and jeopardises his children's future, so he reconsiders. Munny recruits his friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), another retired outlaw, and they catch up with the Kid. Back in Wyoming, an old acquaintance and rival of Little Bill, British-born gunfighter ""English Bob"" (Richard Harris) arrives, seeking the reward himself. He is travelling with writer and biographer W. W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek), who naively believes Bob's exaggerated tales of his exploits. Enforcing the town's anti-gun law, Little Bill and his deputies disarm Bob and Bill beats him savagely, hoping to discourage other would-be assassins from attempting to claim the bounty. Bill ejects Bob from town the following day, but Beauchamp decides to stay and continues to write. Munny, Logan, and the Kid arrive in town during a rainstorm, and head into the saloon. While Logan and the Kid meet with the prostitutes upstairs, a feverish Munny is approached by Little Bill and his deputies. Not realising Munny's identity, Bill beats him up and kicks him out for carrying a pistol. Logan and the Kid escape out a window, and the three regroup at a barn outside town, where they nurse Munny back to health. A few days later, the trio ambush and kill Bunting in front of his friends. Logan, who has lost his nerve and had enough of killing, chooses to return home. Munny insists on finishing the job; he and the Kid then head towards the cowboys' ranch. Kid ambushes Quick Mike in an outhouse and kills him; distraught, he admits that he has never killed anyone before and renounces life as a gunfighter. When one of the prostitutes arrives to give them the reward, they learn that Logan was captured, revealed Munny's identity, and was tortured to death by Bill. The Kid gives Will his revolver and heads back to Kansas with the reward, while Munny makes his way back to Big Whiskey seeking vengeance. That night, Munny arrives and sees Logan's corpse displayed in a coffin outside the saloon. Inside, Little Bill has assembled a posse to pursue Munny and the Kid. Munny walks in alone to confront the posse and kills Dubois. In the ensuing shootout, Munny shoots Bill and kills several of his deputies before demanding the bystanders to leave the saloon. Critically wounded, Bill promises to see Munny in hell before Munny executes him. Before leaving Big Whiskey, Munny warns he will return if Logan is not buried properly or if any of the prostitutes are harmed. The end text says that that Munny left the pig farm with his children and is presumed to have moved to San Francisco. Also starring Titanic's Frances Fisher as Strawberry Alice, Tara Dawn Frederick as Little Sue, Beverley Elliott as Silky, Liisa Repo-Martell as Faith, Josie Smith as Crow Creek Kate, Shane Meier as Will Munny and Aline Levasseur as Penny Munny. Eastwood as the aged former gunslinger is terrific, Freeman is good as his former partner, Harris does well as the posh English gunman, Woolvett is likeable, and Hackman obviously stands out and deserved his accolades as the vicious town sheriff. Eastwood directs the film with real passion, depicting the west as an unforgiving place, with a well-crafted script, splendid performances and the right amount of action and intrigue, this is a marvellous redefinition of the genre, an essential western. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, and Best Film Editing, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Sound, and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Cinematography, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and Best Screenplay. Gene Hackman was number 42, Morgan Freeman number 27, and Clint Eastwood number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Eastwood was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Hackman was number 31 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 98 on 100 Years, 100 Movies. Very good!",
152,25 September 2000,pzanardo,5, I don't see why this movie is so much appreciated,"I don't see why ""Unforgiven"" was so widely appreciated by critics and public. In my opinion, this movie has great faults. The very starting point of the story appears rather unbelievable. A prostitute who makes fun of a client with an obscene joke is very unlikely. And the subsequent behavior of her colleagues (offering a bounty to avenge her etc.) is wholly preposterous: from the prehistory through the 21th century, a prostitute showing such a lack of professionalism would be kicked off by the other ""girls"", with no further comment. I fear that this show of feminine solidarity is just an anachronistic homage to feminists.",

154,10 June 2008,Robert_duder,8, Eastwood's final epic Western...an homage to the Western King,"I saw Unforgiven years ago when I was a kid and I hated it. I hated Westerns and thought it was boring...thank goodness our tastes change. In the last few years I became a HUGE Clint Eastwood fan which led to me finally seeing the Sergio Leone/Clint Eastwood trilogy and a love for the Western but it took me a long time to come back around and see what many consider to be his quintessential Western. This really is his best piece of work when it comes to Westerns and I think it's really terrific that it got the critical and public praise that it deserved and as big of a fan that I am of Eastwood and his westerns he could not have gone out on a higher note. Unforgiven is gritty and brilliant, beautifully shot, and definitely not your typical western. The lines of good and bad are very blurred, there isn't a clear cut hero or villain. I even think that Unforgiven pokes fun at Eastwood's persona a little bit in a darkly comedic kind of way. Eastwood is a long retired killer/gunslinger and stumbles in trying to get on his horse or shoot a weapon and it has an heir of spoof to it without ruining the dark tone to the film. Regardless you can feel the film building to the climatic gun fight at the end. The characters are well created, wonderfully written and fit the story perfectly.",
155,2 February 2021,severindringel,8, A worthy end of a legendary genre,"In what is still his last appearance in the genre that made him a superstar, Clint Eastwood has created a true classic. His western Unforgiven is still considered the crowning achievement of one of the oldest and most legendary film genres. The plot is quickly told: an aging serial killer, who for the love of his family hasn't picked up a killing weapon in ages, is suddenly confronted with a job again. Since he is in need of money, he seeks out his old partner and makes his way to the place where the big massacre is to take place. There, a cold-blooded sheriff awaits them, who will do anything to protect his citizens.",
156,3 June 2010,pfgpowell-1,6, By no means the masterpiece all declare it to be - too many clichés,"Oh dear, everyone says how fantastic Unforgiven is, what a superb swansong for Clint Eastwood now in the twilight of his career, how Eastwood has redefined the western and undercut is clichés, and generally what a marvellous film it is, and I'm about to disagree. In some ways doing so is rather like breaking wind at a wedding, but I must be honest. I'll admit it: Unforgiven is a good Western and better than some, but in this reviewer's view it isn't the masterpiece some seem inclined to make of it. More than that, I can't quite even begin to understand why some people claim that it is. I have never thought Eastwood was much of an actor: he has the Man With No Name down to a T, but over and above that, even in the fabled Dirty Harry films, I've often felt him to be one-dimensional at best, and here I remain unconvinced by his character, William Munny. Munny, we are told, was at one time the meanest, most cold-blooded and most ruthless killer in the West but who was then - handkerchiefs at the ready girls and boys - tamed by the love of a good women. She transformed him and made him see the error of his ways. So when he is recruited by a self-styled young killer - who, it turns out, has never killed anyone despite his boasting and is horribly short-sighted to boot - to murder two cowboys in revenge for what they did to a whore, he agrees to do one last job only very reluctantly because his hogs have caught swine flu and he needs the money. Yet a few years on after his Damascene conversion to righteousness he is now such a good egg that he has forgotten how to mount a horse and can't shoot straight for toffee. Well, pull the other one. Just why the young would-be killer would come to the back of beyond to seek out Munny to enlist him is never made clear and - call me cynical - but the young shaver has 'plot device' written all over him. Munny sends him off with a flea in his ear, but has second thoughts and seeks out Morgan Freeman, another reformed killer and his former partner in crime, and the two of them head off from Missouri to Wyoming to catch up with the would-be killer to do the deed and collect the money. Freeman is another problem. He is a great actor but far too avuncular to convince as a man who had previously killed in cold blood. So far so clichéd, so what's all this talk about Unforgiven actually undermining clichés? Eastwood continues to be utterly useless, catching pneumonia and allowing himself to be beaten up by Gene Hackman's rather unpleasant sheriff, until the Moment Of Truth: his good friend and partner Morgan Freeman is caught and beaten to death by Hackman, so Eastwood Takes Revenge. Instantly, he is transformed from that wheezy old has-been into the ruthless gunman of yore, corners the sheriff and 20 of his deputies and sidekicks in the saloon and dispatches a great deal of them. Naturally, as is the way of films, he is lucky enough not to catch a bullet even though all 20 are shooting at him. Well, my response to all that is yet again: pull the other one. OK, Unforgiven is nicely shot (although it includes that post-modern cliché that it rained almost all the time in the West despite what earlier films showed us) and generally does the business, but outstanding it ain't. Sorry. In many ways it is cobbled together: what was the point of introducing English Bob, another notorious gunman who, presumably, also arrived in town to kill the cowboys and claim the reward? None as far as I can see except to introduce the unusual sight of an English gunman and give a turn to Richard Harris. Then there is the curious portrayal of the sheriff: it seems we are supposed to regard him as the baddie, yet all he does is insist that everyone should observe the town ordinance that no guns should be carried in town. Admittedly, he enforces that ordinance rather ruthlessly, but then he isn't exactly dealing with choirboys, as the case of two cowboys cutting up a whore only because she laughed at how small he was in the man department surely demonstrates. Incidentally, Hackman provides one of the better performances of the film. Saul Rubinek's itinerant writer of dime novels is included to demonstrate how the old West's is passing and is already being mythologised, but little more comes of him. So forgive me if I don't join in the general chorus of 'what a masterpiece this is'. As I say, it's entertaining enough and better than some but don't get carried away. I first saw this when it was released and remember coming away feeling vaguely disappointed, although I could never quite remember why. Now I can.",

Eastwood's low-key direction serves the movie well, relying on character interactions to build the story. The performances are pretty good, particularly Hackman as a sadistic sheriff. There are two weaknesses that keep this from being a better film. The dialog becomes somewhat pretentious and preachy in driving home the point that violence is bad. Then the film does an about-face at the end, going against everything that it has been preaching, with Eastwood seemingly having a flashback to his Man With No Name days. Still, about 90% of the movie is worth watching.",

I think revisiting it now, after watching many more films directed by and/or starring Eastwood, it's safe to say that this dark, almost anti-western is the best film he's ever directed. Part of me prefers The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly as far as movies starring Eastwood go, but Unforgiven would be the best film he's overseen as a director. It certainly has some strong competition, mostly from Eastwood's hot streak during the 2000s: Mystic River to Million Dollar Baby to Flags of Our Fathers/Letters From Iwo Jima to Gran Torino was a phenomenal run, and he did it while in his 70s!",
161,6 July 2012,poly-nikes,5, How did he get so good with a gun?,"I think a lot of viewers read more into this film than is there. I didn't think it was all that good. For one thing, near the beginning, the Eastwood character cannot hit a stationary bucket with his six-gun at very close range; yet, in the denouement, he goes into action like Wild Bill Hickock on steroids, taking on a whole room full of bad guys and taking them all out on his own. Where did he acquire this acuity? We don't see him taking intensive target practice throughout the film.",
162,9 November 2009,iainnalec,3, Still not forgiven,"I will keep this review short and simple. Unforgiven lives up to its name as I have still not forgiven it. Richard Harris portrays one of the weakest characters I have ever seen in a film. Despite being listed as a star of the film, he barely features. He arrives in town, acts rather stereotypically English, gets beaten up for said actions and leaves. The end. Gene Hackman is laughable as Little Bill, with a name that makes him sound like an Indian war chief than the hardened Sheriff that he is supposed to be. The way in which he plays his character is like a detective in Murder She Wrote...only with less life and even worse acting. When the prostitute gets her face cut up I half expected Angela Lansbury to burst in with a piece of evidence linking the saloon owner to the crime. 'Bill; I think I know who did this, but I need your help to prove it...' It would have been more entertaining certainly. This brings me neatly to Clint. Oh where did you go wrong. One minute you're a mysterious preacher in Pale Rider and then you are a cardiac waiting to happen like an extra out of Dads Army who keeps falling off his horse... The only person who brings some redemption to this film is Morgan Freeman who, tragically is killed by the producers before he can make a true impact on the film, for being mildly entertaining. The question really, is just how much worse could this film be? With its all star pantomime cast, it could be tricky to pull off, though no doubt the producers could still nick a few coins from all our pockets. If you want a good classic western, pick up Appaloosa or Pale Rider. These are far more entertaining and do not stereotype the Englishman as a t**t.",

I thought ""Spice World"" was the worst movie ever, but Clint Eastwood now holds that title with this disgusting ""movie"". Easily the worst movie my girlfriend or I had ever seen. And between the two of us, we have seen some real winners. I actually enjoyed The Good the Bad and the Ugly. First, a lot of people think this is some kind of grand statement by Eastwood about America just like in The Outlaw Josey Whales. But it's not. It's a mad dash by Eastwood to show you every disgusting image he can think of. Sure it's nasty. But in a nation with G.G. Allin, Eminem, and John Wayne Gacy the shock value is gone. And disgusting for disgusting's sake doesn't make any kind of profound statement. America gives people a wide latitude to be as degenerate as they want. That doesn't make America filthy. Second, the acting is horrible. Half the lines sound like they're being read off the cue cards for the very first time. The other half sound a little better, but they all lack any kind of real inflection or feeling. And the plot... how are these people at a cross road in their life? Somewhere right now, as you're reading this, someone is plotting the torture murder of a child for sexual gratification. How is Clint Eastwood worse off than those people? He's not, and the whores are not even close. The only redeeming quality this movie had was when Daso X starts making his list of wrestling figures.

171,9 February 2014,campbell-russell-a,10, Eastwood's Masterpiece in Ambiguity and Regret,"For all those who believe in karma, ""Unforgiven"" is not for you. It is a film that depicts the world as being a place in which who you are and what you do bring about consequences that are in no way commensurate. Delilah, the young and inexperienced prostitute, indiscreetly giggles at the size - or lack of it - of a client's penis.She has her face brutally slashed by an enraged cowhand and this injustice sets off the train of further over-reactions and injustices. The client's companion who has caused Delilah no harm and who displays true remorse and a genuine willingness to make amends by offering her his best pony, is gut shot and dies in dread and agony whilst pleading for water. Ned, who finally cannot bring himself to murder for money, is brutally tortured and his corpse displayed as a warning to other would-be assassins. Little Bill, incomparably played by Gene Hackman, obviously believes that by portraying himself as a public avenger and as an upholder of mainstream attitudes, values and morality he will be somehow cosmically protected. He protests,""I was building a house"" as if pleading his case to a more just and higher court as he contemplates what he considers is an unjust death. He builds a house not only as a place to stay but as a bulwark against the bad men such as assassins and the merely dissolute drifters and teamsters who he has been called upon to deal with in the western towns as they transitioned from wild and lawless to relatively civilized. Bill wants to be part of the transition but he has been part of the wildness for too long and his righteous tirades cannot completely mask the sadistic pleasure he takes as he brutally beats real or potential wrong doers. In fact, Bill's righteous talk always seems like he is protesting too much. Bill's inability as a carpenter is symbolic of his inability to make it back from the dark side. He says that he wants to sit on his porch and watch the sunset as he smokes his pipe and drinks his coffee and we believe him. He does not want to deal with bad men anymore and is slow to respond when called upon but, like an addict, when he becomes involved he cannot resist one more kick than necessary. William Munny is another who is trying to transition from the wild west to civilization. He has done the worst of crimes, killing women and children and murdering men without due cause. Do we cheer him as hero because he is now murdering in the name of giving his children a better future? The reflective theme music as the epilogue is printed over a silhouette of Munny's final farewell to the wife who changed his evil and dissolute ways leaves us at odds with how to feel about what has happened throughout the film. Are we pleased that Munny went to San Fransisco and prospered in dry goods? ",

To some torture is a Foreign Language film. For me it is a Western, no other cinema is more painful. So why did I rent Unforgiven? Two reasons, one I am watching all of the Oscar Best Picture winners. Unforgiven was a noticeable hole in list of films in the past 20 years. Secondly maybe I have seen all bad Westerns and if I gave a good Western a chance I would enjoy it. Well that is a big 'no'. I had to fast forward at the half way point, the only reason I did not just turn it off was to see the credits and who have gone on to become stars in the 14 years that have past. No real break outs, Clint Eastwood continues to get accolades for acting and directing as Morgan Freeman continues to get nominated for the next ten years until Million Dollar Baby where he wins for best supporting. Saul Rubinek, a TV actor, most notably goes on to 3 years of 'Fraser' as Daphne Moon's fiancé. Richard Harris does Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series among other roles. Gene Hackman continues a successful career. Frances Fisher goes on to a supporting part in Titanic. Unforginven is the story of Big Whiskey Wyoming. A cattle hand loose it when a green prostitute lets out a little giggles at his manhood's lack of presence. He cuts up her face with a handy knife. The owner of the saloon/ bordello, Skinney Dubios (Anthony James, who quits acting to become an artist after this film) complains to the Sheriff, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) about the monetary lost he will incur because 'no one will want to sleep with a cut up whore'. Little Bill decides to fine the cattle hand and his partner (I am not sure why the partner was ever brought in to this he never touched the girl and actually tried to stop his lunatic friend) in horses to be given to Skinney. The women of the brothel are outraged at the lack of substance in the justice. They end up pulling together one thousand dollars for a reward to who ever kills both the cattle hands. This brings all sorts of undesirable characters to Big Whiskey: English Bob (Richard Harris), a gunman that feels obliged to tell everyone that the fault of the U.S. is it's lack of a monarch. Wild Bill Munny (Clint Eastwood), Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) and The Scholfield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett). All have a problem with Big Whiskey's ordinance of 'no fire arms in town'.

Such an unglamourised approach is refreshing to say the least, and gives the characters a lot of depth as we follow their personal journeys towards an unforgettable conclusion.

199,18 April 2005,malkane316,7, Quick Reviews!!,"Eastwood directs what many feel to be his masterpiece, a Western which tries to be lyrical, which tries to be more real in the shadow of many that have gone before but retaining the violence of those films. Eastwood stars as a retired killer Munney, one of the most notorious and deadly bounty hunters ever. He met a woman who changed his ways, and they settled down and had kids. However, she died soon after, leaving him with the kids and some pigs. When a young prostitute is beaten, her and her friends look to their sheriff for justice. Hackman plays Little Bill, the Sheriif who wants peace in his town but will go to any lengths to achieve it. The justice he dishes out is minimal, so the women place a bounty on the heads of the two men who hurt the girl. The word spreads and young, ambitious man who calls himself the Schofield kid decides to collect. He needs a second man though, and goes to Munny who at first declines. However, he is getting old, is no good at farm work and decides to join the kid, bringing along old partner Ned to the displeasure of the kid. When they get to the town they realise what breed of men they are, and how justice is rare. Munny is caught by Bill and beaten. Later they kill one of the men in a reluctant shoot-out, and Ned leaves seeing what he is. The Kid kills the second man while he sits on a toilet. After the initial high he sees what he has done, vowing to never kill again, and leaves. Munny prepares to collect the bounty, but hears that Bill captured, tortured and killed Ned. This awakens his old spirit, and he goes for revenge.",

Then when it was nominated for several Oscars, being the pretentious film snob I was at the time, I was so disgusted and later so outraged when it won the Best Director and Best Picture Oscars that I ceremoniously burned the toy Oscar statuette I had after the broadcast. Of course, I look back on the contenders for Best Picture now and think, `Well it probably WAS the best choice' although I firmly believe that Altman deserved the award for `The Player'.  ",

202,21 May 2017,kokkiarun,8, Excellent movie,Happened to find this movie by chance. Beautiful masterpiece by Clint Eastwood.. Typical western cowboy movie and excellent performances by Morgan Freeman & Clint Eastwood.. Shows the emotional journey & varying perspectives of few killers - 2 experienced ones and an amateur / beginner. The experienced killers struggle with their emotions to kill people (used to be arrogant and killed people for fun in their youth); they do not gloat with glee on the number of kills they have done so far - rather they are filled with remorse and fear. Whereas the amateur has never killed a soul so far but boasts of having killed 5 people (when truly his eyesight / aim is quite bad). Surprising to find a cameo by the first Dumbledore Richard Harris in this movie :) (can't imagine him in any other role) !!,
203,2 January 2023,davidmvining,10, Eastwood's Greatest Triumph,"When it comes to Clint Eastwood's directing work, it's important to separate the films he made for financial reasons (The Rookie, Firefox) from the ones that were more personal to him (Bronco Billy, Honkytonk Man, White Hunter Black Heart). This feels like the latter, a script he gravitated towards (after decades languishing in assorted places, including his own office when his script reader hated it), that didn't really have much perceived potential for huge box office gains, and had a lot to do with Eastwood's own image subverted. Of course, it's obvious that there's an effort to demystify the Old West gunslinger in general, but the main focus really does seem to be more personal for Eastwood. That it became a big hit and won Eastwood his first Oscars is something of an irony, I think.",
204,22 September 2005,gelman@attglobal.net,10, Circle Back and See This One,"Prior to Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby, I did not think of Clint Eastwood as a serious film maker. Wowed by those two films, I decided that I needed to see The Unforgiven, which when it came out I disdained as another of the shoot-'em-up Westerns in which Eastwood had frequently starred. If you haven't seen this film, do so IMMEDIATELY. Although it is being sold in a package with Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby, I wasn't able to find it as a single. However, I signed up for Netflix, put it at the top of my list and received it two days later. In many ways, The Unforgiven serves up a heaping portion of the clichés that have deservedly caused film makers to avoid Westerns in recent years. There's the retired gunfighter (Eastwood) and the sadistic sheriff (Gene Hackman), the black sidekick (Morgan Freeman) and the inevitable shootout. But Eastwood's character is a lot more interesting than the usual retired gunslinger and Hackman's is possibly the most sadistic sheriff ever. A wonderful touch is Richard Harris as English Bob, a preening professional killer brutally beaten by Hackman's sheriff. If, like me, you thought Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby were wonderful, go find The Unforgiven and see it!",

208,27 January 2008,PeeJay,7, Good but not superb,"This Western-style movie by Eastwood shows that Eastwood still is a master in portraying Western-characters. Even more he knows how to create the classic-western feeling even when his plot and story are up to modern standards. He builds up his character carefully, till the glorious moment which in fact means also his downfall from the standards and moral he has set for himself. A good performance by Morgan Freeman, the most sympathetic character in this movie, and a violent and annoying as almost always Gene Hackman combined with a appearance of Richard Harris give the movie a strong foundation when it comes to acting-talents. The main disappointment is the predictability and simplicity of the story. In fact the story is not much more than a background to the character-development of Eastwood and thus falls a bit short of a 5-star or even a 4-star movie, in my opinion.

I kept hearing about how great this movie was. Mostly from critics. Always a bad sign. I haven't actually looked up revisionist yet but if it means boring, badly done and kinda pointless, then Clint Eastwood nailed it. Ok, let's review. Clint plays a creaky, dusty, moldy, incredibly old ex-outlaw named Will Munny. We find out he gave up drinking and killing and other bad stuff to get his old lady(now deceased) off his back. Now he spends his time farming, raising two kids and falling off his horse. A prostitute is attacked in another town by two cowboys and has her face cut up because she laughed at one of their...uh, junk. Always a bad move. Guess she wasn't there the day they taught that at prostitute school. So the other prostitutes pool their money and offer a reward to whomever will come and kill the two cowpokes with the small genitalia. Will (Clint) decides he could use the cash so he abandons his two small kids, falls off his horse again and heads out. Along the way he picks up Morgan Freeman so he can get killed. They also hook up with some kid who can't see or shoot worth a **** and take him along because...uh...heck i don't know. He never does anything so you got me. Oh. Speaking of not doing anything, Richard Harris shows up as English Bob. He goes to town, get the ever-loving *** kicked out of him by Gene Hackman, goes to jail, then leaves. Weird. So our ancient, geriatric heroes ride into town. Pretty sure they had their left turn signals on the whole way. Almost immediately Gene kicks Clints wrinkly old butt and a little while later gets Morgan Freeman and beats him like a red-headed step-child too. The problem is that Freeman dies (either from the beating or advanced old age. Not sure which.) and this really pisses Clint off. He chugs a bunch of fake movie whiskey and rides into town to shoot Hackman and a bunch of movie extras. Not sure what happens after that. Does he get the reward money? Does he go back to his two kids he left alone and defenseless in the Old Indian and out-law infested West? (Just follow the buzzards Clint). Does he buy a smaller horse so it not so far to the ground next time he falls off? Heck, I don't know. What I do know is that if you make enough movies long enough the Academy will eventually give you an Oscar sooner or later. 2 arthritic stars.",

Just about the only thing going for it is the story. The narrative with the whore being cut up and then the law doesn't do much about it, so the whores have to hire their own killer to get the bad guys... that part was good.

John Wayne's final film ""The Shootist"" was better at that with the last scene in the saloon where Ron Howard throws the gun away and John Wayne nods in agreement and dies. Certainly the director of that movie, Don Siegel, were he still alive at the time, would have done a better job with ""Unforgiven"", as he had as director of earlier Eastwood films. It was only Eastwood's aging that allowed him to make this particular kind of Western, and with that aging came a consistent decline of quality in his output.

There is nothing sublime here, nothing pathotic in the murders.

245,19 December 2022,VikingBurialService,10," The ""Chinatown"" of the Western Genre","A 10/10, and easily the best western movie I've seen; better than The Searchers, High Noon, Good/Bad/Ugly, etc. This movie takes a lot of the archtypes and tropes of old western movies (the gunslinger-for-hire, the up-and-comber, the corrupt sheriff) and adds depth to all the characters. There are almost no characters in this movie that are outright ""good"" or ""evil""; all exist in a morally grey area that makes the movie not just engaging to watch, but thoughtful as well. The dialogue benefits from this depth too, with most of the lines feeling 'real', like something an actual person would actually say instead of some tropey, John-Wayne one-liner. The cinematography and camerawork are fantastic - the movie starts off with these detailed shots of the broad, open west, and gets darker and closer as it rushes to the final confrontation. Speaking of final-confrontations, it's also the best shootout I've seen, aside from the standoff in Good/Bad/Ugly. Even the score - though it's not blow-your-socks-off good - holds its own better than most western scores. This movie could be released today, 30-years later, and I wouldn't notice the age. It's a remarkable, outstanding, dark western; easily Eastwood's best from both an acting and directing POV.",

247,25 February 2010,Aaron1375,8, A western where things are not black/white...a lot of gray in this one.,"This western is not your typical one, it is about a couple of guys who cut up a prostitute and the prostitutes in return offer a reward for killing these guys as they do not think the guys got enough punishment from the local sheriff. Well a man who was apparently a really bad outlaw and is now a man of the lord raising his two children as his wife has passed on is recruited by a young gun wanting to get the reward for killing the two guys. Well the old gunslinger gets his old friend to come along and the three of them are now after the bounty. The movie though poses a lot of questions like who exactly is the bad guy in this piece and who are the good guys? The answer is there really are no bad guys and good guys. Clint's character and the other two assassins as they are called are just in need of work and actually show regret over the ones they killed at points in the movie. The sheriff seems to have a short fuse and he does go over the line from time to time especially in his handling of Richard Harris' character and especially Morgan Freeman's character. Still, he is the lawman and he is trying to do the best he can for the town he is in as he does not want people coming in to collect bounties and killing. I have to say the worst people in this one are the prostitutes as they are the ones who invite all the trouble and misery in town. Sure the woman got cut up, but why did they feel the need to kill both men, the younger one was sort of bullied into helping his friend cut up the gal who survived the attack. If the older prostitute cared so much for the younger one perhaps she could have explained the dos and don'ts of being a call girl. Still, it is a movie of interpretations as I am sure people could argue that the assassins are bad, Hackman's character the sheriff is bad and all sorts of ways to put it. The acting is really good, I kind of wish the Richard Harris character was in it a bit more. If there is fault in the movie it is that it tends to move slowly in areas and while I sort of like the interpretations I sort of like a movie a bit more cut and dry, however seeing as there are plenty of those movies this one looks more unique and so that minus can also be a plus. So while I am not normally into westerns this one is actually rather good.",

What I think about characters at first is always betrayed in later scene about them. In this film, there is no completely good person and bad person. I dare say that one of the main characters, William Munny is a good person relatively, because he goes to kill cowboys for the prostitutes. However, that thought changed later by the scenes that William and his partners try to kill others who are not completely bad persons. I wonder what this title, Unforgiven means. At first I thought unforgiven person is the cowboy, but later I also thought there would be another. So there is no one who can punish others, although someone looks a good person.",

Duke would never have taken on this gig however as director Eastwood portrays a west more wasted than wild, with all the main characters exhibiting at different times weakness and cowardice, often covered by that sort of macho toughness only usually seen in, well, John Wayne movies.

253,29 May 2009,jrocker13,2, Exactly what you would expect.,"Clint Eastwood with a gun, shooting people, and somehow justifying it. This movie did not capture my attention at all, especially with the first scene being a whore and a client. I don't approve of any form of prostitution so the fact that Eastwood' s character and his cohorts were trying to get revenge for them only sickened me more. You know why this is a classic movie? Because out of the two cohorts, it's the African American one that dies. The only parts I found funny were when the blonde prostitute got her face cut up, and when her assailant gets shot. Scenes that were supposed to be funny but made me want to roll my eyes were when the writer pees his pants, the guy that gets shot while he's in the outhouse, and when Kid cries about his first kill. This film had absolutely no point and a very strange conclusion. There was almost no part of this movie that I actually liked. The fact the Munny comes off as this laid back peaceful kind of guy, while we all know he has a bad past, makes for a very predictable movie. Why else would Eastwood play this role if he didn't get to shoot people and fake an anti-hero? My neck hurt so bad after watching this movie because I couldn't stop shaking my head at the cheesy-ness of it. One question I have is, how do people find these kinds of movies even remotely interesting? The only way I kept from cutting my wrists while watching this movie was from the knowledge that it had an ending. To give the move some credit, the use of the terrain and natural lighting did make the movie easier to watch, other than that I found the acting and plot as a disappointment.",

The screenwriter manages to capture some of the best characters and plot points ever created. His dialogue is just so perfect and we completely understand just why each character is doing what they are doing. The performances are also very fine. Gene Hackman is in particular wonderful as the brutal sheriff. Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood are both also very good though. The film is also very well directed by Eastwood.

I rarely comment on the film giving spoiler, but the final scene can actually be quite jarring climate of the film, perhaps Willian (Clint) have to have died, but kill the unnamed man is like killing Superman, Rocky or Batman. The character is an icon, almost a superhero, kill him, it would be like to kill Clint himself, so the director (Clint Eastwood himself) opts for a redemption, not a death. Another point to be discussed is a movie western to where no one pulls the gun and kills 20 people with the eye closed, but a killer who can not kill another killer who never killed and has problems vision and one that has visions of death and can barely get on the horse, and Sheriff claims to love the law and hate killers, beating people who believes to be criminal, are real cowboys, humans, this point of unforgivable is incredible.",

The present condition of will munny contradicts to the talked about past of him which is considered a fabrication by most of them in the movie except a few who has really known him.And even us sometimes. As you can never accept those stories of will's past life because it seems quite impossible for a man to do and yet become something like that how he appears. He never talks about his bravery nor confirms his acts of courageousness. He is not sure of what he has done. Yet when he is really challenged he shows them what devil of death he is. This kind of story puts you on hold till the last five minutes and as those minutes starts and what you get to see as climax your mind keeps saying awesome every second of it. I am really out of my words to praise for this movie and the kind of act everybody has put on. The film says the person who praises himself to be great is not great but the person who is praised by people is actually great. This is a must watch movie for everybody.

It is very professionally directed by Clint Eastwood, who is, at this stage in his career, a professional with westerns, he adds a lot of depth to them, there is more emotion and character development here than you would find in any other western. However, Eastwood's character, despite receiving the most screen time, is the one we learn the least about, which disappointed me, we are aware of his past but there is little detail on it, I felt like we could have learned much more by the end. The performances are stellar, Eastwood and Morgan Freeman are terrific as always, but Gene Hackman steals the show, delivering a very intimidating, somewhat frightening performance, a well deserved Oscar win. Emotional, intense and a top notch cast, Unforgiven is certainly worth the watch, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good western or drama. ",
269,11 July 2020,schroederagustavo,10, Unforgiven Review,"Unforgiven feels very ""meta"", in the sense that the movie is about the Old West becoming a thing of the past, where cold-blooded killers have been tamed, outlaws and bounty hunters replaced with law enforcement, cowboys with self-appointed nicknames instead of others naming them. In the same way, the Western as a genre was dying, if it wasn't already completely dead in the 1990's. Eastwood, one of the all-time great actors of the genre, became now one of the best directors of the following generation, but that past seemed almost gone. Unforgiven, I think, is about how the sins of our past will haunt us to the grave. There is no escape. It features great direction, flawless acting and beautiful cinematography and some of the coolest quotes in any movie ever. Seriously, just check out the quotes section of this page and see for yourself how many memorable quotes there are. It's a great film. And in the end, it feels somehow, that swift justice has been delivered upon this Earth. I love the ending of this movie, the best way to describe it, I suppose, is ""Old Testament"". I think the movie is also about how the movies have made heroes out of killers in Westerns, when the true case is these people have to learn to live with what they have done. The Old West is a thing of legends. So much so, that many of the characters in the film try to pass as dangerous men, when they're really not. And you see someone like Will, who is a terrible and very dangerous person who's killed women and children, who wants to pretend that he's not dangerous.

The ultimate episode of the western wilderness just before it turned so sour that your blood would curdle in your veins and your brain would either calcify into a heartless stone or liquefy into a tasteless brew. The solitary cowboy is the real judge and executioner, in one word that last fatal justice maker that represents the final fate of all crooked minds that meet with their destiny in front of the barrels of his guns just before he shoots them dead with no remission, no suspension, no parole, ever and never. Fatal lethal fateful fate of a big bang death of a few trashy men who thought their violence was god's law to all others. And God came down from his heaven in the shape of Clint Eastwood and he struck them dead with the flashes of lightning of his anger. Just before these hooligans learned that women had to be respected, that plain justice, fairness and humanity require strength, righteousness and forwardness. With only one star in sight guiding their steps, the star that leads to Bethlehem and the birth of a really humane world founded on the salvation of the innocent and the damnation of the guilty, and not the reverse. Probably the acme of western films, the final touch to be able to close a long line of inspiration that has to come to its end since the audience has now lost their innocence. When justified violence is the angry redeeming tool of gratuitous and pleasurable cruelty. But that's also the end of a myth, the myth that there is a salvation of the innocent and the weak in this savage world that could not even think of existing if it were not brutal.",

Beauchamp get off the train and ride into Big Whiskey.There is a no firearms policy in town, and English Bob doesn't believe in that.Little Bill ruthlessly beats him up and puts him in jail.His author pal stays in town and chronicles Little Bill's stories.Later, on a stormy night, Little Bill also beats the feverish and sick William Munny.But they still have a task that needs to be finished.Unforgiven (1992) is a Clint Eastwood movie.This earned him two Oscars, and for Gene Hackman and Joel Cox for editing.David Webb Peoples wrote the screenplay in the 1970's.First it was going to be a Francis Ford Coppola movie.Then Clint found it, and waited for the right time to shoot it.He wanted to play the part himself, and in the early 90's he was just the right age to play the part of William Munny.And he is good, he is real good.There is a lot of depth in his character.He's a man who doesn't feel proud of his past, the man he was.And now he has to go and be that man again.Morgan Freeman is something else as his former partner.Gene Hackman as the villainous sheriff is unforgettable.And the fact, that he's building a house, badly, makes his somewhat a human.Jaimz Woolvett as The Kid is terrific.I can't believe he didn't become a bigger star after that.Richard Harris is marvelous as English Bob.Saul Rubinek as the nervous Beauchamp is brilliant.Anna Levine plays the part of Delilah really well.And so does Frances Fisher as Alice.This is a grand modern western, that shows us the way of the west.To kill those cowboys is something that just needs to be done.More than anything this is a movie about the nature of violence.You kill because you have to, but there's nothing glorious in killing.There's no beauty there, it's plain ugly.There are two great scenes, where that all comes out.One is where those three are firing at each other from behind rocks.Davey is wounded badly, and Munny has to finish him since Ned can't do that.They wound The other is where The Kid does his first killing, shooting the man while he's sitting in the outhouse.He doesn't feel great about it, even though he had it coming.This is also a movie about the western mythology.The ending is superb, something you can't forget.There the man becomes a myth.Munny goes into the saloon and shoots everyone, except the author who witnesses the whole thing.He rides off and becomes the legend of the west.",
274,9 April 2014,ak392,10, The Perfect Western,"I have viewed many Westerns over the years, especially with my dad. While he prefers John Wayne, I have gained a preference towards Clint Eastwood films. This is not a film for everyone, as my father who loves Westerns does not have a taste for this one. He thinks its too long, too dark, and too depressing, a far cry from many other Westerns that tend to champion a hero overcoming the villains. This film has much more complexity, starring Eastwood as a man tormented by his past that he is so hard trying to forget. When a young prostitute is cut up by a man she unintentionally insults, her coworkers seek justice in a town that does not value prostitutes as anything higher than a few horses. Pooling their money together, they create a bounty on the man's life. Eastwood hears of this after a young man seeking the legendary killer, William Munny (Eastwood) to help him on this quest. Filled with imaginative characters, rich dialogue, and a true gritty vision of life during these days, this film stands out as the penultimate picture of Eastwood's career. I urge any fans with a strong stomach for occasional scenes of intense violence and the attention span required for an epic Western to view this film.",

282,29 November 1999,tcuthbertson,9, Revolutionizes Westerns,"Unforgiven is a brilliant movie because it brings humanity and life to the stock good guy-bad guy western movie.  The traditional protagonist/antagonist struggle is more than just reversed.  In other words, the protagonist isn't merely switched to the bad guy role.  Rather, the viewer is never sure who the bad guy is in the first place.  Sometimes we find ourselves rooting for the protagonist, other times we are shocked to find how violent and abhorrent the protagonist really is.  We seek to turn to an antagonist as someone to root for, but there are so many, and they are constantly in flux as well.  If this sounds complicated, that's because it is!  Clearly, this is the resounding message of the movie:  that humanity is sloppier and more complex than traditional westerns.  However, this message is implicit and it propells the plot further and leaves it embedded in the viewers mind long after the tape is rewound.  Traditional western lovers will enjoy the movie's gunfight scenes, and the fairly rudimentary storyline:  atonement for the damage of an ""innocent"" woman.  More intellectual types will watch it again and again in search of a message that will speak to their inner psyche and help to reveal to them what lies within.",

286,14 April 2011,dee.reid,10, Now this is how a western should be...,"I'll make this short and sweet: I will admit that I'm not too much a fan of westerns, but the best ones I've ever seen have always featured Clint Eastwood in them. My father knows more about western movies than I do, but it was because of my father's influence that I was drawn especially to the works of Clint Eastwood (like his Sergio Leone-directed ""spaghetti westerns"" and his 1985 self-directed western-comeback feature ""Pale Rider""). I'd also love to throw in the late Sam Peckinpah's 1969 landmark bloodbath ""The Wild Bunch"" for good measure. Then came in Eastwood's swan song to the genre, 1992's ""Unforgiven."" The Best Picture Oscar-winner of 1992, it stars an aged, then-62 Eastwood as William ""Will"" Munny, a retired gunslinger now trying to make ends meet as a pig farmer and widower with two young children on an isolated farm in Kansas. One day, he's approached by a young bounty hunter named The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), who wants his assistance in tracking down the cowboys who mutilated a prostitute miles away in Big Whiskey, Wyoming. After some initial reluctance and deep soul-searching and contemplation, that's when Munny decides to take on the bounty with The Schofield Kid. Eastwood used his age here to great effect: one of the more dishearteningly realistic and poignant scenes in this film is when Munny tries to mount his horse and because he's gotten older and been out of the game for so long, it takes him a couple tries to get back on the saddle. He contacts an old friend named Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) and the three make their way to Big Whiskey, where they eventually butt heads with the town's brutal sheriff, Little Bill (Best Supporting Actor Oscar-winner Gene Hackman). ""Unforgiven"" is undoubtedly the greatest western I've ever seen; it would probably rank the same as ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (1967), it's that good. What makes this film so especially great is what it doesn't do. ""Unforgiven"" is not all about cowboys, guns, gunfights, and easy women. No. While it has those, it doesn't glamorize them. This is a dark, depressing, violent, and angry film with one of its main concerns being to turn many well-known western-genre conventions (like what I just mentioned) on their head. That is why the Academy saw fit to give this film and Eastwood so many awards in 1992, and why it is commonly referred to as an ""anti-western"" feature.",

The cowboy-flick is one that's been around pretty much since the beginning of cinema and reigned in the mainstream from 1939's Statecoach through the 70's. And in that time the most recognized and celebrated star of them behind only John Wayne was Clint Eastwood. He certainly meant this film to be his swan song to the genre (waiting over a decade to film the script) and in the process he closed it off for pretty much all others. In a sense what makes it so effective as an end, is that it's such a great anti-western. Every trope is thrown right out the window. Morality is blurred, heroes and villains seem much like each other, killing is undesired and brutal and there's no glory to be found in anywhere.

Clint Eastwood standing on an overly sunny hilltop and squinting to see nothing in particular, is there any shot in the cinema universe more effective than that?

In fact, he seems an antihero and overshadows all the other characters in the plot. But when Munny learns about Ned, he easily helps himself with the liquor, seems determined, plans and acts boldly. By the end of the movie, Munny shows the vestige of his fearsome and deadly outlawed past. Then the viewer easily forgets the other characters around and are awestruck by Munny.",

320,8 June 2021,realalexrice,10," Eastwood's most interesting directorial effort, worthy of the praise","Mostly struck again by the film's grim and tonally different, but enthralling finale. Though it doesn't gratify (or shouldn't) the viewer satisfaction to see William Munny return to his old way, Eastwood's self awareness in the part solidifies to me what makes the film smarter than it might initially seem. The violence that we are confronted with, that hasn't appeared in as disturbing and consistent a manner as in the opening, is so alarming that it makes sense that Munny unfortunately has to return to where he was so far from when we first met him. It feels too simple to many maybe, but there's the inherent sadness that Eastwood also brings to the role, which is known even from the very opening as we're met with the information that he's a widower and all anecdotes shared by the supporting cast and Munny himself point to the unjustly violent background of his character. I believe it's what pushes the movie to be more than many other westerns that I've seen as it confronts the genre with more than just the tropes, but the death of them, what happens to the heroes when they become too old to fulfill them? This is perfectly encapsulated by Munny's pathetic, but real, struggle that exists when he decides to pursue The Schofield Kid just to get on his horse. ""Post"" genre films can tend to lead to the greatest critiques as well as the most impactful moments of their respective genres, and this film has many moments like that here.

Of course I was disappointed back then when I saw the product. There just was not anything I had expected there to be. No cool Clint slingin' guns and shootin' off worse guys than himself from the first minute to the last. No cool music by Ennio Morricone. No duels. No abundance of one-liners. So understandably I didn't like the film that much. But now, I'm six years and since I like Clint Eastwood I thought I'd give this film a second chance. On top of that can over twenty-thousand people visiting IMDB and giving this film a 8.0 be wrong? Well I found out that they are not. Unforgiven is a good western, but only for those out there who are prepared for a bit of storytelling. If you're looking for action and one-liners pick up one of Clint's films that I mentioned earlier or their 1990's equivalent: Desperado. You could try to convince yourself to watch this because it has won 4 Academy Awards, but if you're looking for fun and action, do you really care about artistic quality in Directing or acting. I know I didn't and I know most other folks just want to see a lot of shooting as well. This does not mean that there is no action here, or no shooting, it's just that it is not the focal point of the movie. The focal point are the characters here. The professional gunslingers, the starting gunslingers and the retired gunslingers. Good, mature western, made by a matured Clint Eastwood and although I enjoyed it I thought that there was something missing. I know I searched, but I could not find it.

Eastwood also won Best Director and Gene Hackman got himself an Oscar for best supporting actor. A USA Today columnist calls ""Unforgiven"" the best western in over 20 years. I say it is simply the best western EVER. The story is quite simple. A couple of aging gunfighters William Munny (Clint Eastwood) and Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) go after a reward being offered by some vengeful prostitutes in a town called Big Whiskey. They are also accompanied by a young gunfighter-wanna-be calling himself, The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett).

The sheriff hates people who carry a firearm so much he beats people for it but why he is so extreme is never explained, they didn't even give a hint. So all you can do is guess. The sheriff is living the irony of he is after making the town safe but he bullies people for no good reason enough to become a local gang that kills innocent people which I liked this irony especially because of how real-life law officers can be lawfully bad people. Since knives are allowed the story could happen and it all starts with a woman's problem and a banshee making the situation worst. As a result, women put a bounty on men who went too far because they were not satisfied with the ""merchandise"" but these women's sense of justice was so extreme their decision obviously ruined many men's and their families' lives.",

331,25 March 1999,emm,7, A new Western that's branded a new life in a new generation.,"One of the few remaining Hollywood's Rocks Of Gibraltar, Clint Eastwood, displays new vigor to his familiar old cowboy image in UNFORGIVEN. You may have seen a lot of other Westerns before, but with Eastwood's high-quality directing that enriches the feeling of the Old West, it livens up the genre to 90s standards, showcasing the injustices and brutalities that make up for its tedious flow of action. The crisp photography of the surroundings shows authentic life (better than QUIGLEY DOWN UNDER). If you want a feel-good Western that has a reliable sense of humor, discover Gene Hackman as a colorful villain of sorts who can't pronounce the word ""Duke"". I hate to be cruel, but the ending is mighty weak, and largely overplayed with slow pacing. Still, there are sky-high merits to brand UNFORGIVEN as a true Western classic for any generation.",

There are imprints of his other characters here, including those from ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" and ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly"". But this one goes much deeper than those early spaghetti westerns. In a sense William Munny is based on the myth of Eastwood's own characters from those old movies. The movie is peppered with stories about his legendary, grisly ""accomplishments"". It seems to revel in the cold-bloodedness of his prior actions luridly, until you realize that there's a point to all of this. Munny is tired, and he does have remorse for what he's done in the past.

but he wanted to take up the movie when he grows old enough to play the
role. I bet he achieved perfection in it ! The script, per SE, isn't
unique, yet it impresses the brain in it's subtleties, e.g: Till Ned's
death, one feels pity for the frail, repenting and struggling Munny
while Little Bill inspires both respect and hatred - he is vigilant, a
fearless leader and a ruthless but constrained law enforcer but one is
left wondering why the hell he doesn't eliminate the cowboy menace (but
I guess that's what gives a gray shade to his character) !. In fact, he
seems an antihero and overshadows all the other characters in the plot.
But when Munny learns about Ned, he easily helps himself with the
liquor, seems determined, plans and acts boldly. By the end of the
movie, Munny shows the vestige of his fearsome and deadly outlawed
past. Then the viewer easily forgets the other characters around and
are awestruck by Munny.",

He played the role of sheriff, judge, and executioner, and tried two cowboys in the name of justice without argument. No matter what the two cowboys did, it was not important to William. In his heart only believe in his own creed. When Ned realized that he couldn't pull the trigger, and the kid was immersed in the guilt of the murder, it further highlighted the essence of William's killer. Although he was shaped like a bone, he could still kill.
The last battle arranged by Clint should have been a manifestation of the determination of a lone hero, for the revenge of a friend's true character test, but under the construction of the true atmosphere of the movie, it makes people feel that only lunatics will face one Enemies in the house with live ammunition.

After listening to the slow death unfolding for what seems an age Eastwood calls to the victims friends, 'Give him a drink for Christ's sake; we won't shoot'. Later, after his companion kills the second victim at point blank range sitting on the loo, (and becomes distraught at what reality of what he's done) he says to Eastwood, 'Well, he had it coming'.

366,5 January 2020,Dr_Mark_ODoherty,10, Very good psycho-drama and Western.,"Interesting about this film is that all main characters are flawed and have varying degrees of wickedness; the amoral and brooding gunfighter (Will Munny), the cruel and self-righteous sheriff (Little Bill), the opportunistic journalist W.W. Beauchamp; and even the victims to some extent - the sex workers/prostitutes - who were partly responsible of triggering this explosive, violent clash between Will Munny and Little Bill; by putting up the bounty to have the man killed for cutting up the face of one of the working girls; which ultimately results in a massacre and blood bath.
I think the film also carries an important message; namely that getting into a scuffle with an outcast of society is never a good idea, especially if he has got nothing to loose and is a born survivor; as anything can happen in a violent scuffle, as also this film shows - Will Munny simply being 'lucky' when it comes to killin' folks, as he says so himself, after the gunbattle at the end.
Indeed, I think the picture painted in this film illustrates very well that it is never a good idea to get into a scuffle with people, and that we should all try to live in peace with each other - just as the saying goes, 'It takes all kinds of people to make the world go around, though perhaps some shouldn't go quite so far around it as others.'",

A new step in Westerns, we saw the creation of an anti-hero. Someone who was tough and bad but still had the decency and morality to stand up for others. The evolution of the western has finally evolved to this film; it is the ultimate climax. An amazing look at the violence, notoriety, and tragic history of how the West actually was. Unforgiven took everything about the Western and re-examined it. It is a powerful and dark film that has redefined and brought an end to what can be thought of as a western.",
372,4 April 2019,ChristianLeFeuvre,10, One of Clint Eastwood greatest performances,"Making his name in such iconic westerns as 'A Fistful Of Dollars', 'The Good The Bad And The Ugly', and 'Hang 'Em High' and 'Pale Rider', Clint Eastwood takes the reigns in directing and starring in easily one of the greatest westerns ever made, 'Unforgiven'.
In a small Wyoming town called 'Big Whisky', two cowboys who attacked a young prostitute go unpunished by the local sheriff 'Little Bill' Daggett, save for them having to hand over a few of their horses as a fine. The other working girls are not happy about this and let the word be known that they will pay $1000 to anyone who kills the two cowboys.
A young cowboy who calls himself the 'Schofield Kid', approaches former bandit and killer 'William Munny' to join him and claim the bounty.
Munny was once a renowned cold-blooded killer but turned his back on his former life after he married and started a family. Since his wife died he has concentrated on his kids and their farm and is reluctant about returning to his former ways, but, needing the money he agrees and they team up with Munny's former partner 'Ned Logan' and head to the town.
When 'Munny' and the 'Kid' are given the reward after they complete the second kill, they hear that 'Ned' was captured and killed by 'Little Bill', this brings 'Munny's former self back to the surface and he heads into 'Big Whisky' to exact revenge.
In my opinion, this is film making at it's finest.
Even if you are not a fan of the western genre you can not miss this incredible movie.
The whole cast is outstanding and it has to be one of Eastwood's finest performances. Gene Hackman is fantastically nasty as 'Little Bill and Morgan Freeman is brilliant as 'Ned'.
Richard Harris is cast as bounty hunter 'English Bob', and even though it is a relatively small role, it is such a great performance.
Unforgiven is not the usual 'spaghetti western' but is so much more 'real'. The movie's screenwriter David Webb Peoples, and the excellent direction from Clint Eastwood strips away any heroism from the main protagonists.
We find ourselves getting attached to every character. We see the unsympathetic attitude of 'Skinny' the brothel owner, following the initial attack and the cold brutality and corruptness of 'Little Bill' as he dishes out his own style of horrible justice. I could actually feel my toes curl with each lash as he tortures 'Ned'.
The 'Kid' is just naive and we discover he's not as cool as he makes himself out to be. But above all the others, Clint Eastwood's 'William Munny' is such a captivating character. A grizzled, aged killer, haunted by the life he once knew, and desperate to keep his past behind him and retain his humanity, and you actually feel for him through the film with his reluctance to take the on job, his clumsiness in returning to the saddle, his compassion for the scarred working girl and his determination to get this job finished so he can return to the life he now has. However, when he hears of the death of his friend, we feel his anger and watch as the troubled 'Munny' from the beginning of the movie becomes unrecognisable as he turns into the 'Munny' of the past, the cold-blooded killer he once was.
Unforgiven won four Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director for Eastwood and Best Supporting Actor for Gene Hackman, and deservedly so.
The cinematography is stunning, and the darkness of the movie in the rain-soaked night scenes, the darkness of the characters and darkness of the subject matter from the cruelty to women, the merciless beatings, the moral ambiguity to the transition of the main character make this a western that turns the conventional genre on its head.
This was Clint Eastwood's last western and he definitely saved the best for last. It is genuinely a magnificent film.",

Gene Hackman shines as Little Bill- the epitome of the town bully and the prostitutes add a human dimension to the story.  Most of all the tug of war that Munney fights between honoring his wife's memory and going back to what he does well.  All this is subtly played out in the battle with the bottle-- you can feel his tension. Though there was some violence- it all fit into the context well.

In reality,it is not an easy thing killing someone, quite the contrary, it is a very horrific experience (I would imagine) full of internal conflict with one's own emotions, morals and fears, not to mention nerves, especially completing a task as up close and personal as ""face to face"" can get. This film deviates from the traditional ""Hollywood"" western by putting the emphasis on the human condition and not by simply glorifying acts of violence by allowing the protagonist to reign victorious despite any of the odds or obstacles involved. Clint Eastwood and company did a stellar job in conveying a story in such ""true-to-life"" fashion. A most excellent piece of cinema!",

But I am impressed with Eastwood's directing of this film. He took all of his experience as western figures and came up with an incredible western film, so incredible that he became an Academy Award®-Winner for Best Director & Best Picture. Eastwood's age caused no problem for the film. The acting was inspiring and the gunfights couldn't have been better. Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood make a great team together, but Eastwood going solo proves himself to be unpredictable and is making me looking forward to future films with him as director and perhaps an actor, as well. Just as impressive as the Sergio Leone films and I wish Eastwood good luck in the future. We all can't wait for his next western. Bravo, Eastwood.",

His Will Munny has a name, a kind of sleazy sounding one, too, and he has all the problems and baggage 'Blondie' in ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" never knew existed.  In fact, Munny has been saddled with all kinds of character: used to be a cold-blooded killer, was reformed by a religious, loving woman who turned him to Christ - she died leaving him sad, lonely, 20 years 'on the wagon,' and devoutly Christian still (if more for her memory than for himself).  On top of all this, he's a pig farmer raising two small children, still dragging around in his heart the guilt from having once ""killed nearly everything that walked or crawled.""",

As the standard Western heroes - John Wayne, James Stewart, Henry Fonda, Burt Lancaster, Gary Cooper - either died or got too old for their parts, only a few Italian Westerns and an occasional Eastwood one (though he went nine years between ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" and ""Pale Rider"" - and seven between the latter and this) kept the genre alive.  Then, in the early 1990's, two classic Westerns briefly breathed new life into the Western, before it continued to decline (or just died).  Neither were conventional.",

It throws us back, then encompasses us out of 1992, and brings us to the golden era of Westerns, and then it takes us to an almost neorealist aspect about our characters. Clint Eastwood successfully blurred the lines of good and bad in Unforgiven.

387,4 April 2011,Jayalltheway,10, Genius.,"Pure genius, although in my opinion not for the reasons mentioned so many times. I've seen and read so much about this movie, simply because if I had to make a list of my all time top 10 favorites this movie might just be at the nr. 1 spot, although a shared position with a few others. But the message of anti-violence I don't see as much. Of course Munny is tormented by his ghosts from the past but in real life things would be a little different. Men who kill women and children have much bigger problems than Munny does, at least mentally, and in the end he even prospers or so it is rumored, and I don't see the anti-violence in that. On the DVD extra's people who have worked with Eastwood said that this is the picture where the character he has played before, more or less, shows a deeper side of himself, a more fragile side. But in that last scene we just see the same cold blooded Eastwood we know, much more so, and there's nothing wrong with that, far from it. I love this movie but let's be honest, it's because everything builds up to that last few minutes when we finally see the old fragile man back in his saddle, the saddle only one actor I know fits as well as it does Mr. Eastwood. If it were such an anti-violence movie that maybe Little Bill should have killed Munny, leaving his children orphans maybe, I don't know, I'm not a screen writer. But Munny kills a bunch of people and moves on to prosper and Little Bill did have a point when he said: ""I don't deserve this, to die like this"". My kid asked me why I love this movie so much as a big painting of Munny is in on our living room wall. And the only thing I could say is: ""well, this is a movie where the bad guy is good, and the good guy is bad"", or at least it's not sure which is which. But anti-violence? Ned is the only one that is really fed up with it and when he decides to leave Munny says something like: ""we'll find that other one, shoot him and catch up with you"", that's cold blooded, I don't see any lesson learned or ghosts in that. No, Munny seems to have regrets at first but in the end he just does what he has always done, kills everyone and moves on to better times. You might say this killing is just what Munny needed to get his life in order. We all love the bad guys in movies, plenty of top-10 lists out there, Hannibal, the Joker, you name 'm. But if this movie was made from Little Bill's point of view William Munny just might be the coldest bastard ever to appear on screen. Simply because he's the only one that is not insane and get's away with it all squeaky clean. I'd like to see Hannibal or the Joker raise 2 children as if nothing happened. No for me this movie is about the build up, it builds up to that last scene where we get to see that everything Munny said and was before that was, more or less, nonsense. On the DVD David Webb Peoples mentions Travis Bickle as sort of a inspiration for writing this. But Travis Bickle is out his mind and a pretty sad character, Munny would eat him for breakfast. To kill that many people and just have a few bad dreams? Wauw...",

391,13 February 2005,ryan_kuhn,8, Real Cowboys of the West,"There is are certain aspects of Westerns that are given. One of the givens is that the cowboys who go around shooting each other are emotionally detached from the work they are in. The movie Unforgiven uses this expectation, then turns it on it's head to make for a fun and introspective look at the classic spaghetti Western that Clint Eastwood made so famous. Eastwood stars, directs, and produced this, the Oscar winner for best picture and best direction. Gene Hackman was also honored for best supporting actor for his role as the tough sheriff of a lonely Wyoming town. Eastwood plays a former gunslinging robber who has retired to become a father and run the family farm. His struggles on the farm, most notably with his pigs, sends him on a job where the pay has him coming out of retirement, teaming up with his former partner in crime, played by Morgan Freeman. One of the joys of this film is how it does not go for the easy social commentary, and Freeman's race is never mentioned in the story. The Eastwood character is a good man who does the right thing, even if it means being tough and nasty. The end of the movie was the biggest surprise, as conflicts within the mind of a want-to-be cowboy comes to the surface, and a real character emerges. These are the Sergio Leone cowboys made famous in the 60s with the Eastwood vehicles, these are old, experienced, moral cowboys who still know how to get the job done.",

My favorite part about this movie is the fact that there are no heros. little bill and william munny are very similiar, both have a ruthless streak. The only thing that separates them is the fact that Little Bill happens to be a law man and the fact that Eastwood's character is a step more evil than little bill.  Little Bill is more evil than the duke of death and eastwood's character raises it up a notch from there. When he grabs the whiskey bottle, you know that he has just snapped. I can find few flaws with this film and can find something new to appreciate ever time I watch it, although the morality of the kid realizing killing is a bad thing was laid on a little thick. The entire film builds up to the last 10 minutes. During that last 10 minutes you will see the most purely evil, dangerous and frightful cowboy ever put to film.

398,13 September 2022,slazenger_7,9, Revisionist Western With Only One Flaw For Credibility: Casting Morgan Freeman,"The ONLY reason why a 10-star rating eluded UNFORGIVEN (1992) was the casting of Morgan Freeman. Certainly NOT because of his acting but because of the credibility of a Black man in 1880 Wyoming whose best friend is a former Missouri gunman... Anyone who knows anything about history and cowboys, gunslingers, outlaws, and lawmen from 1880s Missouri (and Wyoming), knows that no 'redneck peckerwood' (as Peckinpah Westerns described them) would have befriended a Black man...Let alone one who is his best friend. Historically, that would have been a one-in-a-million chance of occurring. That right there killed much of the neo-realism of this revisionist Hollywood Western. Had the Ned Logan character been realistically (not idealistically) cast with a white man, it would have hit a home run with all bases full. No way would a Black man in the 1880s Old West be allowed as a patron in any Wyoming cowtown saloon...And least likely of all, one who is allowed to be a john to white frontier strumpets. Eastwood's casting was spot on with everyone else ... Especially Hackman. The Ned Logan character could have been played by either James Coburn, Robert Duvall, Bruce Dern, or Jon Voight (see Return To Lonesome Dove). Dern being a year older than Freeman while Voight a year younger. Coburn and Duvall were closer to Eastwood's age. Dern would have been an interesting choice mainly because he played a few nasty cowboy characters and a sympathetic one would have been an unexpected change of persona. Coburn or Duvall would have probably been the best choices to play Ned Logan. So many reviews of UNFORGIVEN have covered so much. There isn't too much more to elucidate. The only other critique of UNFORGIVEN would be that the profanity in this film was anachronistic. Too modern-day. It is no secret that Eastwood as a filmmaker has been obsessed with George Stevens' SHANE (1952/3) throughout his film career. It was Clint's input to Leone when he remade Kurosawa's YOJIMBO as FISTFUL OF DOLLARS to make the main villains the Rojo Brothers (after the Ryker Brothers in SHANE). As with Morgan Ryker in SHANE, Esteban Rojo frequently laughs like a hyena and gets killed the same way (trying to ambush the hero at the end). And Eastwood's main antagonist in ANY WHICH WAY YOU CAN was named 'Jack Wilson' and played by a somewhat Jack Palance look-alike, William Smith. Finally, he himself loosely remade SHANE in 1985 as PALE RIDER. For UNFORGIVEN, he had it set in Wyoming as was SHANE. In spite of the neo-realistic revisionism of Eastwood's vision, Clint approached UNFORGIVEN with modern, late 20th Century sensibilities, standards, and social values. In 1880 Wild West America, when the Little Bill Daggett character publicly brutalizes English Bob or bullwhips Ned Logan, the town onlookers and his deputies are shown flinching from the savagery of his actions. This would have been the reaction of modern, late 20th Century Americans. Eastwood forgot that the America where his fictional story is set was a very, very different place. An America where public lynchings of outlaws and criminals were commonplace. In 1893 at Paris, Texas, just 13 years later from when this fictional story is set, a black man named Henry Smith was charged with the brutal murder of a 4-year old little white girl (without any trial). His subsequent public lynching (on 1st February 1893) was attended by over 10,000 people which included women and CHILDREN. Henry Smith was tied to an elevated scaffold and tortured for 50 minutes with red hot irons and then doused with kerosene and burned alive (!!!). Dozens of photographs were taken of this event and some were made into postcards (!!). Clint Eastwood should have further researched or remembered factual events like this when making UNFORGIVEN.",

413,17 June 2010,tmpj,9, The Last of a Genre....,"""Unforgiven"" is, in many ways, Clint Eastwood's magnum opus on westerns. We won't be seeing many more like this one, and there have not been many made since that come close to this one. It's like Clint himself saw the writing on the wall for the western, and composed a cinematic opus that would stand on its own, and which incorporated a number of themes and elements that would not have been allowed on screen during the heyday of the ""spaghetti"" westerns. Morgan Freeman's presence breaks ground in the movie, as he is not playing a cook or a servant or some other stereotypical role. Clintwood casts him as an equal, and as a past partner in crime, and the chemistry between the two is part of what makes the film work so well. Gene Hackman is sufficiently oily as Little Bill, the sadistic sheriff, and the late Richard Harris as English Bob gives us plenty of the foreign perspective on the goings-on in the wild west. I have wondered what might have happened if Clint had decided to cast Harris as Little Bill. It seemed plausible to me...but second guessing Eastwood at this point serves no useful purpose...the film went on to critical acclaim and commercial success...and it's one of the films that I would not just want to watch, but would also want as part of my collection. Two old style gunslingers go out on a final fling to collect reward money if and when they catch up to a bunch of yahoo cow-pokes who cut up a whore in a brothel. The other whores do not feel that she has gotten justice, and they pool their resources to put out the reward to have the culprits done in. Eastwood as Munny plays a dangerous killer who has turned his life around and put his guns away. He has become a hog farmer, and it is getting the best of him. With two kids to support he has to think about the future...at least for the welfare of his progeny. When this opportunity comes his way, he turns his back on it at first...but then reconsiders. The money he stands to make is a temptation he cannot afford to pass up, and he wants to give his kids a fresh start at something other than sod-farming. He changes his mind, recruits Morgan Freeman ( as Ned, his old running buddy from the gun-slinging days), and the situations and people they encounter on the journey are what fills the screen in this very engaging drama of the old west as it was fading. I have a few caveats as far as sexual situations and language...as well as some gratuitous violence. But the film is terrific, and it is definitely a worthwhile watch. The last of a genre...yes...but it is a movie that is very nearly a great movie.",

425,13 July 2004,Manthorpe,10, Yeah.,"Although I don't typically describe myself as a fan of Western flicks, mostly due to the fact that I simply haven't seen most of the greats yet, I truly loved and enjoyed this film. Clint Eastwood plays William Munny, the baddest and meanest son of a bitch ever to walk the Earth...and killer of women and children. It's simply amazing that Eastwood not only starred in this, but also directed and produced it. One of the few examples of this that can be given. Mel Gibson also did a decent job in his Braveheart. I think that if you have seen all of the Western Eastwood classics that this movie might even be more enjoyable for you, as it's rumored that Munny is simply an extension of some character he's played in the past. After finally getting around to seeing this one, I will most definitely go out and educate myself in this genre.",
426,27 July 2013,teejayniles2345,8, Is this a story about Avenging a Wrong or about Murder as an Addictive Behavior?,"I agree that this is a great Western movie of the 20th Century -- it is certainly not typical with the reason for the Action and Conflict being the aggrieved women themselves. The cast of characters as developed by David Webb Peoples and director/producer Clint Eastwood are a sordid bunch. We see the earthy and grim parts of a lot of the ""Wild West"" and learn that Gun Control is not just a measure of the contemporary U.S. political groupings. I don't quite think that the main character is an anti-hero but he does seem a bit like a reformed addict pushed to the breaking point. It is not for the young and over-sensitive. UNFORGIVEN (1992) is a good example of a two-hour feature that doesn't need the big tech-effects to keep us thrilled and on the edges of our seats. It does reflect a kind of critique of gun violence while showing that guns can provide a kind of means of revenge where the ""bad"" people get their comeuppance. I rate it an ""8"" *",

The man who are shocked because of his partner's laughing at his penis' lenghth goes crazy and chops the prostitute's all organs except the private point. Upon this fact, the sheriff Little Bill who is known with his discipline is called to the brothel by Skinny who is the manager of Greely brothel. Little Bill investigates two men one of whom attacks the prostitute and decides to whip them in spite of the objections of the prostitutes. After that Bill gives up this decision and replaces the decision as like that:Two men will bring totally seven ponies to the end of time that is given by Bill.Then the time goes and ponies are brought by two men.But the prostitutes aren't pleased with this decision of Bill and of course ponies. The prostitutes aren't satisfied and send news by the men who have sex with them about a reward which will be given to the man who kills two men. Skinny learns this fact and wants the help of Bill who should prevent such kind of fact. Even English Bob hears the award corresponds to 1.000 dollar and goes to the town.

Both films are heavy on what it takes to kill a man, in what you might call the everyday run of things, that is, outside a national war situation. Eastwood looks good, but he has only one persona, one expression, one tone of voice; hard, laconic, matter-of-fact. Both films focus on the killer instinct, the man who doesn't think twice about ending another man's life. Lancaster's lawman kills because it's his legitimate job; Munny kills for money, and for revenge. Lancaster ends up with nothing, but Munny ends up prospering in dry goods. Both films make you think. However, Lawman is the better film, with a better plot and script; and Lancaster is the better actor. My feeling is that Unforgiven's ratings will drop over time, whereas Lawman's will rise.

440,31 January 2010,johnmschofield,10, A unusual but superb thoroughly watchable study of some really colourful characters,When I watched this film for the first time on DVD I was frankly completely underwhelmed by the whole two and a bit hours. Maybe my original expectations for the film were unrealistic or just simply wrong because when I watched it again years later I must have been in the right mood because I was blown away by its innovative approach. For me it simply doesn't fit any convenient criteria and when you watch it the story doesn't unfold in some reasonably predictable way. It is continuously changing and evolving and whenever you think you have it figured it goes down a less worn path and I was drawn back to it all the more because by this point you are watching to see where it is going to go. It isn't really just a western its a fine study of hard times for virtually everybody concerned and the lengths each will consider to survive. I would recommend anyone watch this film as it is genuinely interesting and makes the viewer think about what is important in life and it doesn't preach a message but simply lays it out for opinion. Please be patient when watching this film and in my opinion you will not be disappointed.,

It will be interesting to see how long Hollywood can afford to throw profits to the wind, to appease the unappeasable. I'm giving it a 9 because the cinematography isn't poor - it's like it simply was never considered. And westerns should be a gold mine for cinematography. Looking back, I don't think Eastwood ever cares about cinematography when directing. I'm guessing he's the guy who thinks you're dumb for pulling over for a view.",

Put him in a movie with legends like Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, and Richard Harris, and this sad fact becomes even more painfully obvious. His line delivery is just so out of place and comparatively terrible that it'd be laughable if it weren't actively ruining an otherwise OK movie. He's known for his ""stoicism,"" but it's honestly more of an emotional vacancy so profound it comes across like he's doing a first table read. I'm struggling to understand the appeal.

443,9 March 2005,timmyklob,10, Has it both ways,"The film simultaneously deconstructs the Western myth and reasserts our need to believe it. I think we have to be very conscious of our emotions as Munny walks into Greeley's for the last time. Look at the wonderful shot of his gun barrel entering the frame from the bottom of the screen. Listen to the thunder boom when we see him standing there. Notice how the unarmed man he shoots, Skinny, is the most detestable character in the film, and how we have no emotional investment in any of the deputies he shoots. Little Bill has tortured to death Will's best friend, an innocent man not capable of violence anymore. Everything is set up to either justify Will's rampage or for us to say, ""Man, that's cool."" I used to feel like Will left part of his soul in Greeley's, but now I think he was just doing what he did best. W.W. Beauchamp is a stand-in for the audience of all Westerns with his slavish hero-worship. He's just seen what was thought to be only mythical brought to life, and he couldn't be happier. And I think we'd be lying to ourselves if we didn't feel some of what W.W. does, too. Our fascination with violence, after all, is one reason Westerns became the trademark of American cinema.",

446,8 November 2007,Cheetah-6,8, Cowboys With Issues,"Even the cold blood killer can have a heart and a conscience and appear to be a man of integrity. Clint Eastwood brought the western into somewhat new territory with this film about cowboys with serious misgivings about how they've chosen to live their lives in the past when they were murderous gunslingers. Even still in their new lives when things turn difficult with hardship down on the homestead they cease an opportunity to do perceived justice by reverting to old ways for a profit, although with some hesitation. This is much in the vein of the Eastwood mold that has developed where the line between good and bad characters is blurred and qualities of both show up in the main characters, you know, more like real people. Eastwood seems to be fascinated with presenting hero's with flaws and here it's especially effective in a genre that was well known for presenting well defined good and bad guys. Everything works about this film, casting is spot on with great performances from all involved.",

It is a great depiction of a man who once lead a violent and evil past but has changed his ways. It is also the story of his partner Freeman who has agreed to join in on there worldwide redemption of killing. And the young killer who has lied about killing so many. It is a great movie about characters and goes very deep. Eastwood finds himself in a spot where he is faced to confront a man who has wrongly killed his partner and he ends up turning into the man he once was int he past. It is a great movie with a great script and fantastic characters. But if your looking for a western with a lot of action or a very active script you are looking in the wrong place.

454,15 August 2006,fullonrobotchubby,10, Eastwood's Best... Without a Doubt,"Thanks to Unforgiven, I recognized the many talents of Clint Eastwood that I had been misjudging for so long for whatever reason. Before Unforgiven, Eastwood just seemed to be a squinty-eyed, raspy-voiced, uptight desperado who liked to shoot people and occasionally hang out with an orangutan, respectively. In 1992, Eastwood took his directing, acting, even music composition (!) seriously and made the best western I have ever seen (so far... and yes, I've seen Tombstone). The people who say Eastwood is a terrible actor are either A) still bitter he swiped Paul Giamatti's Best Actor nomination spot last year, B) unaware of the powerhouse undertones Eastwood can spring on an audience, or C) both. My favorite scenes (tie) are both because I marvelled at Eastwood's acting: when he responds to a crying young fella who wrongly thought he was ready to kill a man, and the climactic ending. This classic western about a showdown between two unofficially retired gunslingers (Eastwood and Morgan Freeman) and a no-nonsense sheriff (Gene Hackman, another Oscar-winning performance) has everything anybody could ask for in a Clint Eastwood film. Though Million Dollar Baby cemented Eastwood's rep as today's best film director for an actor, Unforgiven is his masterpiece.",

Most of the dirty jobs of gunning down ""assassins"" and making the sheriff's own policies belonged to Little Bill Baggett. Bill the Sheriff was not wrong about a lot of things and policies, but Baggett had a violent way of dealing with ""problems"". So English Bob was interested in a game of billiards, but he also deliberately ignored the gun law in Baggett's town. Much like Wyatt Earp's towns in the Old West. With the apparent difference that Earp was trying to stop outlaws. Were English Bob and William Munny outlaws? Yes, I suppose they were.

It's beautiful in so many ways, but Eastwood's direction and acoustic guitar-laden score are only a sample of what is on offer.

482,3 April 2016,duncanbourne,10, Unsurpassable,"What makes this film so great is Clint Eastwood himself and his history in the world of westerns. Which means that in a sense you have seen the younger William Muny in his wilder days (yes I know Clint was never the ""bad"" guy but Hell Man-with-no-name was hardly squeaky clean either) and can visualise what he was like. Nevertheless that is just icing on the cake. Clint delivers a powerful performance of a man trying to escape his past which clings to him like a bad smell. It because of his past that he is sought out to join the bounty hunt and everyone he comes across who knows of his past exploits is wary of him. But Clint is a seemingly a broken man and not the black terror he once was. Only at the end do we catch a glimpse of what made him so feared before as he passes into the night and becomes the darkness. The late great Richard Harris is superb as the aged gunfighter English Bob, and like Eastwood plays up to his own past as a hell-raiser. His biographer Saul Rubinek counterpoints him as a bumbling writer who recasts the brutal and morally dubious reality as legend. Both Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman also give excellent performances. Especially Hackman as a brutal sheriff in a brutal world who only wants to sit on the porch he made. In many ways the film is about how stories grow in the telling, from the increasingly horrible verbal descriptions of the injuries suffered by the prostitute to the literal creation of the legend of the west by Bob's biographer.

484,26 June 1999,sailor-28,10, As close to authentic 1800 drama as you can get.,"Few films give viewers a chance to see multiple perspectives on the same issue.  The Unforgiven was one of the few that did.  It was quite violent and authentic in many ways.  The terror and intimidation that is commonplace in law enforcement until just ten years ago can trace it's roots back into the era when frontier expansion was monitored with brutal behavior.  Clint Eastwoods' role as a reformed outlaw turned bounty hunter give a chilling example of how the world just seems to be turned up-side-down when a single act of violence occurs. The values of the 1800 society portrayed in this film gave viewers the impression that terror was not the exception, it was the rule. Before public education was born in the 1900's to solve social problems like high crime and skilled labor shortages, one gets a fairly accurate glimpse of the 1800's reality of what type of conditions existed.  Morgan Freeman, and Gene Hackman played their parts very well.  Few could really criticize the way the film's director defines barbarian.  Our frontier expansions of the 1800's were filled with brutal characters in every segment of that society.  This film helps me celebrate how much this country has advanced since then.",

489,15 October 2002,thrillhouse678,10, Truly excellent.,"Unforgiven is a truly wonderful film. If you don't like westerns, then I still suggest you see this movie, because its quality transcends the limits of any particular genre. Eastwood plays William Munny, a former gunslinger who picks up his six guns looking for one last score. He is joined by his friend and former partner Ned Logan, played wonderfully by Morgan Freeman. The two aging outlaws set out for Big Whiskey, Wyoming, where a group of vengeful prostitutes are seeking retribution for the battery of one of their own. Gene Hackman gives an Oscar-winning performance as ""Little"" Bill Dagget, sheriff of Big Whiskey. He is desperate to keep bounty hunters from riding into town looking for the money the prostitutes are offering. Richard Harris gives a memorable performance as English Bob, a legendary gunfighter who rides into town looking to collect. Little Bill looks to make an example out of Bob, who is an old rival. Along the way, Will desperately tries to convince himself that just because he is temporarily returning to his old life, it doesn't mean he'll stay that way forever. Will's journey to face the man he once was is accompanied by a truly haunting musical score, and breathtaking cinematagrophy. Unforgiven is a story of violence, revenge and redemption, with a non-violent message. It is truly worthy of its best-picture Oscar.",

491,16 June 1999,Gustav-11,10," ""We all have it coming, kid.""","Just as ""Saving Private Ryan"" is the war movie to end all war movies, ""Unforgiven"" is the western to end all westerns.  In the history of film, the ""western"" film genre has been one of the most violent.  Senseless violence to say it more truthfully.  Usually, there are bands renegades, a solo gunslinger, and a countless number of innocent fatalities.  Some would say a western is filmed for violence for violence sake.  The typical ""western"" usually represents the moral conflict of good vs. evil.  Pushing further, the brother-genre of the ""western"" is the epic war film, which in moral terms is validated by the soldiers fighting for a certain philosophy, i.e. freedom, tyranny, religion.  What has usually lacked in the ""western"", is a script that goes beyond the anarchic confines of the great plains, where a man or family is tested to fight for survival.  That is until ""Unforgiven"" was filmed.  I can only praise this films intention on a philosophical level.  Clint Eastwood, who stared in and directed this film, has taken a moral standpoint against the type of films that brought him into fame. The beauty of this film and the reason it is potent is that there are no good guys or heroes present.  It's intent is to show, through realism, the absurdity of glorifying the life of a gunfighter in the wild west.  All the main characters are bad guys: the hit men, the rapists, the law enforcement. As a viewer, it is only by habit that one would side with Clint Eastwood, for in the characters actions they are all morally bankrupt.  This film topples the pedestal that Clint Eastwood has stood on throughout his career. Conceptually, this film is a treatise on the consequences of pulling a trigger with the intent to kill for killings' sake.  Of course, in the situations that surrounds these men, it is either kill or be killed, backed by the idea of self-defense.  But this film has Clint in the role he has played so many times before, which is the roving hitman. Only this time we see the thoughts and reactions of a man who has killed more men on film than is imaginable.  This time we also see his friends, his children, we know his history. All these things, which are usually left out of the plot, when considered helps us to dramatically understand the motives and react to the consequences that face a premeditated killer.  What a  courageous statement filmed by Eastwood!",

496,1 September 2006,momohund,10, The Greatest Western Ever Made,"I make this statement for its realism. Most westerns, including The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, never really seem to capture what the Old West was really like. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly was fantastic in terms of its film technique, but we never get to appreciate what it was like to be inside the Old West. Not only does this film do that, but it also delivers the quintessential Eastwood as the great gunslinger. What I liked about this film was how an excellent story line easily integrated with heroism antics (the ending scene) and top notch acting by everyone in the film, as well as showing us what the Old West REALLY was like... hardly romantic, but dirty, filthy, and full of people living on the edge of society. People constantly facing off against the elements of nature and societies barely on the map, societies that as of yet could hardly offer infrastructure and social equity. what we get is a stark and shocking portrayal of people forced into a situation of natural selection or the survival of the fittest, which is what historians are saying the Old West was really like. Neighbor against neighbor as people, without the resources of the city, fight daily to stay alive.

""Unforgiven"" makes us question not only the natures of good and evil, but whether those terms are even relevant in explaining human actions. There is not one character in this film who is truly good, so where should our sympathies lie. Who's the ""good guy"". All of the major characters are shown in a more of less sympathetic light. Little Bill, who is in some ways the most evil character in the film, can also be seen as the one character who is most consistently on the right side of right and wrong.

First of all let me just say I am still pretty young, so you will probably laugh at what I'm about to say, but I consider Unforgiven to be Clint Eastwood's best movie! It's truly a masterpiece, and when you add Morgan Freeman, and Gene Hackman into the mix, you know it's gonna be a good film! I look at Unforgiven simply as this, A man who has turned away from a life of Violence, and he is looking to raise his kids and remember his wife who has passed away... When a Gentleman known as the Schofield Kid shows up and offers Munny (Eastwood) a chance to split the reward of a violent act, he decides to go, but only if he can bring his best friend Ned (Freeman).

Clint eastwood is a boring old man who speaks so monotone and slow it makes you want to commit hari-kari. Gene hackman portrays a villain about as menacing as an 8 year old child and there is some idiot 'kid' who is just really annoying. Its probably quite sad that I was happy when Morgan Freeman died - at least something actually happened. I watched this film because I didn't fancy a 3 hour film to bore me to death - oh how I was stupid. This film is just rubbish. Probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life and that includes the Star Wars sequels. Its like each character is trying to bore the others to death. You think its all going to build up for a Good, the Bad and the Ugly style ending when what you actually get is 9 seconds of shooting. Clint Eastwood is the most overrated actor ever. He is boring and slow and old and just really tedious to watch. Its actually just painful. I was convinced to watch this on a Saturday evening. Murderers get less. Never ever watch this film or if you do it is at your peril.",

515,14 August 1998,Sickfrog,10, The Last Great Western,"In what has been hailed as the last great Western that will ever be made (though I recommend the recent ""Tombstone"" as well), Clint Eastwood proved that he is capable of creating a masterpiece. The amazing script, which slowly turns from what looks like any other decent western into an intricate study of morality and mortality and eventually, a message arises of the horrors of violence. Yet, it is Eastwood who truly does take this film up to the next level and then up several levels more. His bold, stylish camera work makes this film pristine and conveys every mood he wants to convey in every scene so that you could watch it with the sound turned off and still feel every emotion intended with every scene. Also, in front of the camera, Eastwood's performance is his greatest to date. He embodies William Munny perfectly. You see that he is a good man, a reformed and repented man. You sense the good that his former wife did him. And at the same time, you can almost feel those demons that used to rule him. The carries with him a brooding presence and you just know that this man has seen evil... he has been a part of it. The greatest struggle in this film, the suppression of carnal instincts, occurs within this man. And you watch that happen throughout the entire film, occurring all within him. Also, stellar performances by Gene Hackman (for which he won an Oscar), Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris maintain this films excellence. Also, Jaimz Woolvett delivers an emotionally dynamic performance as a naive young man, trying to prove his self-worth and maturity by trying to become the kind of killer Munny used to be, though the message is eventually delivered... what William Munny used to be is the opposite of self-worth and maturity. It was an animalistic and berserk nature that everyone harbors, and it is only through determination and courage that they can be overcome.",

They also didn't cheat at cards or spit on the sidewalks."" Only the evil ""bogus"" cowboys (not to mention gamblers, ranch owners and businessmen) got drunk, killed people, used whores and cussed.

It was a canvas for a modern American mythology.  But once Peckinpah created his savage western to end all westerns (preceded by Sergio Leone's anti-westerns), there wasn't much more to say on the subject.  There wasn't any room for the classic western of yesteryear.

Why do we permit Squint to do these things to us: dish out extremes that belong in a 1950s comic book rather than in a serious film? We can accept that a good woman has diverted her man from drunken shoot-outs, theft and killings of women and children (though how or in what circumstances the latter occurred, audiences are not told). We conveniently overlook the fact that he leaves his young children, both sub-teens, to feed and look after themselves while he rides from Missouri to Wyoming for one last job. Can anybody seriously imagine those kids would survive by themselves, far from civilization, with no adult supervision? Or that the Eastwood character, Will Munny, and his sidekick in crime, Morgan Freeman as Ned, would not soon discern that their gang member, the Schofield Kid, had never racked up a reputation as a gunslinger? In Big Whiskey, where most of the action occurs, there is far more actual kicking of men when they are down than in any western I can recall. Co-star Gene Hackman is known to have lamented the violence after the movie was released. His character, Little Bill Daggett, the sheriff, was the principal offender. The last shot in the movie is Munny's shotgun blast at an injured man lying moaning on the darkened floor of the hotel. It is aimed straight at the groin, and elicits a shriek of pain.

If you have decided to have only one western in your DVD collection, buy this movie. This feature is not a typical western movie, Clint Eastwood has done a great job indeed.",
536,21 March 2008,amb4,8," Unforgiven will not turn on everyone, but I love it.","The film splices in existentialist messages with the counter-clichés used as poignant commentary on the romanticized Old West Myth, albeit the film is just one of a countless many pitching that revisionist view, and there are others still far grittier. Gene Hackman is outstanding in the role that earned him the Oscar nod over Nicholson (A Few Good Men). His character is brutal, but also discerning and just--so, almost wisely brutal. Commend the filmmakers as well that his portrayal makes a convincing antagonist even if the audience so happens to perceive him as essentially--a good guy. Lines such as ""...because he was so damn drunk"", ""I've always been lucky when it comes to killing folks"", and ""Deserve's got nothing to do with it"" will resonate long after the end credits. The historical and natural order can be blurred with ideas highlighting our inescapable yet vague understanding of the utter randomness of life, a matter which makes any analysis over what the film accomplishes especially subjective.",

In addition to directing, Eastwood leads the cast and gives and excellent performance. And, co-stars Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman are incredibly good as well.

In fact, aside from the setting, it may not even be a western movie. Some people cannot like a movie with a despicable main character. But this is what is presented throughout the movie. As with real life though, each character has more than one side. Munny is evil yes, but is able to show compassion, and even fear (unheard of in action movies).

The character of the Schofield Kid was both overacted and not too realistic.  I don't believe that his act of killing would have changed him forever. Also, if goofs are relevant, the Schofield S&W revolver does not have a swing out cylinder. (Bill Munny swung the cylinder out to reload it). There are a lot of Westerns that are as good, but they have nowhere near the cinematic quality, and they do not feature other fine actors in vignettes (Richard Harris) and (Gene Hackman).

Suddenly, nothing makes sense anymore.. I felt like I was being left by my wife and children, stranded on an island.

The storyline is that one of the prostitutes in the saloon is slashed in the face and ends up with permanent scars. The Scofield Kid (an over-cocky young kid who winds up not being able to see two feet in front of his face) shows up at Eastwood's place and tries to recruit him to avenge the man who slashed this girl. One gripe I have is that in these Westerns all the characters are made out to be stupid like they never got past the fifth grade: they can't talk correctly (which includes Eastwood's character) and all the men are about are slinging a gun and sleeping with prostitutes. ""Yessum"", ""I reckon"", ""I spose so"" and ""I don't do that no more, kid"" are standard lines in this movie. Even the prostitutes are extremely stupid.

It is not surprising that the movie was so interesting, mainly because of the actors. Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood are top notch performers which surely reflects in this film. My personal opinion is that Gene Hackman is one of the best actors when it comes to playing bad guys. He is tough, cool and gives an impression that he doesn't really care for anything. He is the law and that is it. If you don't like it, turn around or suffer the consequences. The story was pretty much a revenge flick positioned in the old West so it wasn't something new and not one of the best features of the film. The direction was OK I guess, I can't think of anything bad, or good for that matter, to say about it.

After being saturated by innumerable implausible one-man-against-many plots, Eastwood delivers a wonderful-realised conclusion (or so it would seem) to his Western career. It could only really be Clint, the star of the Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns, who manages to mix into the usual gunfight glamour and clear good guy/bad guy mix the realism of sleeping in the rain and the past that you sometimes cannot escape.

It has to be one of the best done, climatic shootouts ever...little details of this movie go unnoticed but have impact such as the scene in which Munny and the kid are waiting outside of town for their pay...it starts off by giving you a visual of the town and an indistinguishable figure riding toward them in the distance...the following dialog between Munny and the kid (a classic dialog in and of itself) takes place within the time it takes for who turns out to be one of the whores with the money (and the sad news) to ride from town to them...from time to time during the dialog, it shows the figure getting closer and closer...i think that this scene puts you into the pace of the life back then and adds to the overall realism this film tries to capture...yes, at times it is ""slow-paced"" as some here complain...but then, life was actually that way...unlike the action-packed, fast-paced, never-a-dull-moment life many westerns would have us believe life to be back then...life was hard, filthy, untamed, boring, and slow-paced with moments of total mayhem. Wyoming, a beautifully picturesque place, especially as depicted by most travelogues, was also shown to be a real place with nasty unpredictable weather to balance the majestic beauty it also offers...The recurring question to Beuchamps claim to be a writer: ""of letters and such?"" is another little example to detail this movie pays to the time and place of this movie--people's only reason to write back then would be to write letters and such--that was something probably everyone did back then, much like everyone talks on the phone now...it was the only thing they could relate writing to...probably the first writer of books and magazines any of them ever met...who had time to write books?

569,3 June 2009,lifetimejuli,7, A Mixture of Feelings,"Unforgiving is a four Oscar winner, western film with many great actors like Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and the living legend Clint Eastwood as start, director and producer. This film tells the story of retire; alcoholic, and bounty hunter cow boy name William Munny. He change his way of life, because of his wife. At the present, William Munny is a widower, father of two children making a living as a farmer. One of my favorite performances was done by Gene Hackman as Little Bill Daggett. He is the sheriff of the town, Big Wisky. He is the law and the law said ""no guns allowed in town"". The peace of his slow town got disturbed one night when two cowboys that were enjoying themselves in the local bar got offended when the hooker jiggles at the size of his male anatomy. Suddenly one of the cowboy's whips out his knife and slashes the face of a prostitute he's with. Little Bill Dagget the sheriff, instead of arresting the cowboys, allows them to get off with the understanding that they hand over six horses to the saloon owner as a payment for damage to his property ""the whore"". Bill's decision got the victim's best friends furious. The victim's friends pool their savings and offer a bounty of $1000 to anybody who will murder the cowboys. This reward money brought a lot of bounty hunter to town with their guns, including Clint Eastwood. Little Bill beaded the hell out of each bounty hunter who stepped into town breaking his laws. Combinations of feelings, about Little Bill Dagget views of justice take you over when he takes law into his own hands. I think movies are a great entertainment.

Unforgiven begins as a remarkable look into the life of ruthless cowboy William Munny (Eastwood) . For most of the duration of the film, we can see that Munny's sorry life and resentful anger is leading to something, and by God it does. After over an hour of character development, Munny and his partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) set off with The 'Schofield Kid' too assassinate two petty thugs, who soon find themselves under the wrath of the three cowboys. While all goes well, and Munny and The 'Schofield Kid' collect the money from the assassination, Ned Logan is caught as he heads south, and killed by the local towns sheriff, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman). Munny soon finds out about the death of his partner, and sets off back to the town to take vengeance on the lawman. The ending of coarse, being the thrilling highlight of the film.

Again William Munny, who was brutally beaten and disgraced by just a single man in hotel just because he was totally not ready for such a worst welcome and whose first expression was of a weak man proved him weak in reality too. But later when he returned to the same place for the revenge of his friend's unjust murder and for providing him the justice, William Munny returned to the same place against tens of armed men just with a double barrel rifle in his hands but with cold blood and iron eyes and an expression of a real furious warrior.

Because in Unforgiven, Eastwood takes what was by then the very tired old genre of the Western and re-invigorates it, bringing back the spirit of Shane and Stage Coach and Rio Bravo and even, of course, his own earlier work like The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and High Plains Drifter.
