0,17 March 1999,Stephen-12,10," A slow burner, a fine achievement","Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.",/
1,13 October 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, Incredible,"I don't think I have been this moved by a movie in a while. Good Will Hunting is an incredible movie and if I had to say what I think is Gus Van Sant's best film, this would be it. It is a slow-burner, but I think this was purposefully done and it added to the film's poignancy and psychological aspect.",r
2,3 September 2008,bkoganbing,10, The Genius In Our Midst,"So many personal projects of our best players never come out quite right. The vision they have somehow doesn't translate to the screen, or it's not box office subject matter, or maybe the actors aren't gifted with writing or directing talent. That's certainly not the case with Good Will Hunting which was not only the breakthrough film for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but it will probably remain their most personal endeavor. ",e
3,21 January 2001,rondine,10, This movie has a brilliant script...,"It appears the jury is hung... many people either loved or hated this movie. I can tell you why I loved it. First of all the script. I think it had a real slice of life, and brilliance in it. Sorry, but some people do use 4 letter words to express themselves. And no, it doesn't mean that's because they lack intelligence to use anything else. I can rise to the occasion any time I need w/out profanity. But it is how I think & speak in my day to day life. The language shouldn't even be an issue. If that's all you heard, you weren't listening! The brilliance in it is everywhere. For example, William's character putting Damon's character in place by noting that he sneers at things that he has no real life experience with. I know people like that. Then moments when he (William's character) says gems like, ""I'll save you the suspense sport- she isn't perfect & neither are you- the question is whether you are perfect for each other."" I'm paraphrasing of course. The question of relationships, and life career decisions- the courage to risk and overcoming whatever your background is, are all a part of real life. This isn't supposed to be about genius or some ""white trash"" as someone else said (some people might say the kids in this movie aren't trash, just normal hard working, middle class guys) - it's about love, life and courage- courage to ante up & try again, no matter how many times life knocks us around. The acting, direction and script are wonderful. They definitely deserved the Oscar for this. It has soul. It has meaning & I am sad for the people that didn't get it. As the movie ""American Beauty"" said... LOOK CLOSER.",v
4,27 February 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8, Its central performances are phenomenal and its inevitable emotional release is truly powerful.,"The genius of 'Good Will Hunting (1997)' isn't in its plotting or its resolution or even its character arcs per say (which are all a little formulaic or clichéd to an extent), but rather in the nuanced and realistic journey that that these almost fully-formed people take to reach the conclusions you know they eventually will. The two central performances are nothing short of phenomenal. Williams' subtly wise and humorous demeanour exudes fatherly knowledge as a man of experience and Damon's frustratingly yet understandably closed-off defensiveness makes his inevitable emotional release truly powerful. The writing rounds them off in ways which make them feel honest, imperfect and, most importantly, real. 8/10",i
5,29 October 2008,RedRoadster,9," ""I had to go see about a girl""","This is one of those films that you cant help walking away from without being touched in some way.

Friendship, love, pain, the past holding back who we could be in the present, acceptance (or not) of our place in society.",e
6,22 June 2017,Bored_Dragon,9, Beautiful,"I return to this movie from time to time for the last two decades. I do not like Damon and Affleck, but this is their lifetime achievement and the most deserved Oscar they will ever win. Beautiful drama about finding yourself, finding a balance between the essence of life and its everyday appearance, about love and friendship. Realistic, unpretentiously philosophical and warm movie about life. Two main trumps of this movie are its perfect script and brilliant Robin Williams, the actor that adds warmth and love in everything he does. I can not say it's a masterpiece of cinematography, but it surely is beautiful, intelligent and it never gets old.",w

Yet, the casting is so well done, and the acting at such good level, that interest is nicely maintained.",/

9,28 December 2016,Hitchcoc,10," A Sensitive, Remarkable Look at Genius","Matt Damon's Will Hunting couldn't be more complex. He is an utter genius. Unfortunately, he has enough baggage to send him around the world. Will is a brilliant mathematician, smarter than many of the professors at MIT. However, he is depressed and self destructive. He gives up the minute things get hard. He can't relate to others, especially women. After many failures to help him, he hooks up with a man who respects him (but who also fears his insights) played by Robin Williams in one of his finer dramatic roles. He pushes Will and Will pushes back. The interaction between two imperfect, but brilliant, human beings is the core of this movie. Created by Damon and Ben Affleck, this was probably the best movie of the year. Will Hunting is searching for happiness, as are we all, but others have decided what that happiness looks like. He is indeed ""hunting"" for joy in his life. Excellent performances all around.",w

Or was was it about someone who scowers thrift stores? Well, it has nothing to do with good will or Goodwill, it's about a young man called Will Hunting. He's a(somewhat unrealistic)genius who can solve math problems that baffle the world's greatest minds and knows twice as much on any subject covered in a Harvard class...yet he works as a janitor.

19,5 July 2019,heisenberg12,8, Good but overrated and overhyped,"It's a good movie; the premise is its best point, as well as the human connection between friends and relationships, but so many reviews on here calling this a masterpiece or one of the best movies ever made are way unwarranted and over the top. It's a good low budget movie with some depth and a famous role for Robin WIlliams, who won the best supporting actor Oscar. The script is good, but not great, the directing is slightly above average, it drags at times, and some little aspects of it are unrealistic. It's definitely good and worth a watch, but it's not one of the greats of all time.",r

Well, for the few that might read this, I find this movie very accurate about the state of seeing a counselor. It is also very accurate about a man who carries deep toxic shame within keeping him from intimacy with others and living with massive defense mechanisms. Because of this, I understand why some do not like this movie, it taps a part of themselves they are still running from, and that is why this movie is so powerful.",e

Just seeing this classic for the first time after being a long time fan of Damon & Affleck (who wrote the screenplay!), and R. Williams having tragically passed, somehow made it even more excellent. This is masterfully presented, powerfully engaging entertainment. If you have any tears in you this movie will bring them out when it gets a hold of your emotions.

I have to say now that I have finally seen it, I can see why. The film is beautiful in so many ways, the characters and their stories, the cinematography, the character development, the relationships between the characters, and makes you think about your own life, your own potential, your own achievements and what you want from life. The case was beyond impeccable and everyone played their roles superbly. I loved everything from the script to the setting, and I couldn't recommend this film enough. Definitely a classic!!!",

35,20 October 2002,moonspinner55,7," Quite good, except for a bogus ending","Barbed script full of ""F--- you's"" doesn't seem like a likely candidate for a Best Original Screenplay Oscar, but this one did win and I think the performances are the reason. The acting here is so strong--particularly by Matt Damon, who co-wrote the thing--that I believe it makes the writing seem better than it is. There are some terrible sequences that can be blamed on the script, direction and editing, such as the bit where Damon's friend Ben Affleck substitutes for him at a job interview. However, the acting usually rescues it, with Oscar-winner Robin Williams pensive and endearing as a psychologist who becomes therapist and mentor to closet-genius Damon. Minnie Driver is also excellent as an unlikely love-interest for Matt, but the finale is almost too hokey to believe. In their efforts to tie this all up with a big satin bow, novice writers Damon and Affleck sink their modest little ship just as it's about to dock. Too bad. **1/2 from ****",

The pauper genius is just fairy tale nonsense. In fact, the more you delve into these shallows, the only element that remains anchored and of value is the toned down Dead Poets character that Robin Williams reprises and the universal message he promotes.

Not only were Will and Chuckie endearing characters, every one else in the film conveyed a smooth and natural performance. Even Minnie Driver proved she could fit in her role as Skylar.

44,20 July 2013,kenjha,5, Pretentious and Manipulative,"A math genius works as a janitor at MIT, unable to overcome his difficult upbringing. The premise of this film is ludicrous. It really requires suspension of belief to buy that Damon, who never attended college, has become a genius by reading books. The pretentious and manipulative script by Damon and Afleck really reaches: not only can he do complex math problems, but he can hold his own with anyone when discussing politics, philosophy, economics, literature, and history. We are supposed to root for Damon, but he's such an arrogant jerk that one roots for someone to punch him out. Williams is fine as a psychologist, but it's a role he has played a number of times.

I think the casting was good, although I don't think Ben Affleck does a very god job in this film. Robin Williams deserved his Oscar, although a big part of me still thinks it belonged to Robert Forster for Jackie Brown. Matt Damon is very good in the lead role. I particularly like the scene toward the end when Matt and Robin's character's open up. The emotion is overwhelming and that is some great acting. The rest of the cast is good too, and Gus Van Sant's direction is powerful. Great movie.",

52,30 June 2010,elshikh4,1, Unbearable !,"10 years ago I've watched it. And it gave me only pain ever since. Pure and clear, I hate this movie. Rather, what's here to love?! Let me tell you, the moment when (Robin Williams) was talking about his wife who farted till she waked herself up, the joke of the girl in the café about old people's sexual perversity, the stupid never-ending lecture about genius guys (which seems copied, as it is, from many books), all of that are little instances for how disgusting and boring this movie is. Actually, this is what lived from it with the poor me. And when it comes to its cast, then let me bleed with hate; (Ben Affleck) is underrated actor, he is, since he isn't hated enough! I just can't stand (Minnie Driver) as an actress. And (Matt Damon) is so cold and unconvincing in mostly all what he does. There is a good story there, but totally murdered by adolescent script and provocatively mute direction. Nothing is beautiful in this movie. And while it's supposed to be touchy, it totally isn't. Save the scene of (Affleck) talking about missing his friend, I didn't enjoy anything. Enough to say that after its ending, I blamed myself hardly for setting all through it, and after 10 years I still do. Without further ado, and to be incredibly objective; THIS MOVIE ISN'T FOR ME.",

54,21 August 2017,Uriah43,7, An Emotionally Disturbed Mathmatical Genius from South Boston,"This movie begins with an incredibly gifted young man named ""Will Hunting"" (Matt Damon) working as a janitor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The problem with him is that he is extremely anti-social and is constantly getting into trouble with the law. Then one day he sees an incredibly difficult mathematical formula posted on a bulletin board there at the university and he writes the solution on it without any difficulty. Needless to say, the professor who put the problem on the bulletin board named ""Gerald Lambeau"" (Stellan Skarsgård) is totally amazed and immediately sets out to find the person responsible. However, when he finds Will he is totally unprepared for the emotional wreck in front of him. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that I really enjoyed the performance of Matt Damon, Robin Williams (as the psychologist ""Dr. Sean Maguire"") and to a lesser extent that of Ben Affleck (as Will's loyal friend ""Chuckie""). On that note, I should probably mention that Matt Damon won an Oscar for ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"" while both Robin Williams and Minnie Driver (as Will's girlfriend ""Skylar"") were each nominated for an Oscar as well. Be that as it may, although the film has some slow scenes here and there, it has a quality soundtrack and enough good drama and comedy to entertain nicely enough, and for that reason I have rated it accordingly.

Two upcoming movie stars, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck felt that their career was going nowhere. Instead of just playing stock characters and fading into obscurity, they went at it, wrote a script and sold the script at a meagre price of $600,000 in hopes that some movie production will take it in. You may think that the script for ""Good Will Hunting"" was made by virtue of dumb luck, well news flash, it was not. It was two people who understood humanity very well in how we function, interact and were able to create a believable world with people we can all relate to whether likable or not. From their experience growing up in Massachusetts, Damon and Affleck may have met people like the characters portrayed here and seem to have a better grip on what these individuals faced so that they were able to understand them which makes the film high on quality. The Academy Awards in 1998 had Damon and Affleck Oscar winners for Best Original Screenplay, in addition it had Robin Williams the winner that year for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.

Whats more, nobody would have cared. This is Hollywood at its ""Indie"" best. Trying to pretend that some of their hot properties can be artistic as well. The only problem is that this film is so painfully average and predictable, that few film festivals would have given it the time of day, had it not been for the writers. The story is an old one, just set in a bit of a different setting. Young tough, down on his luck, born poor, no future, gets opportunity and betters himself. Ahhh, what a ""feel good"" story. Please! I just love the scene in the bar where Will shows up the cocky Harvard kid on his knowledge of American History. Damon reels off one of the most laughable historical arguments in American History. The information is accurate, but the source is ludicrous. There is no way that his character could make such an argument, even if he had read the authors and understood them. He showed knowledge of the Harvard curriculum that even someone in the Liberal Arts Department would not know. It just strained credibility as this whole movie does. It was an average at best movie that was hyped into a masterpiece. I dismiss the Academy, because I know how the Hollywood Insider game is played. I mean, come on, Kim Bassinger and Mira Sorvino have an Academy! LOL! I mean, Beverly Hills Cop won for best screenplay, even though it had been passed around for five years.

There is some debate about whether veteran screenwriter William Goldman had a hand in the finished product, but nobody slags off Tobe Hooper because Steven Spielberg supposedly directed the lion's share of ""Poltergeist"", do they? Anyway, I reckon if Goldman WAS involved, it was only to polish up a few minor details. The bulk of the screenplay has the air of being written partly from experience. I think the criticism the lads received may just have been jealousy from the Hollywood establishment at having the temerity to nab their first Oscars so young.

It is an equation which reads, Superior intellectual equals power, but results in pain and isolation. Such is the story of Will Hunting, superbly played by Matt Damon. Born with a I. Q. Genius, the young man seeks friends and mathematical challenges alike. Consequently when he finds either, he attacks one and embraces the other. As a result, he lives in a world of turmoil and volatile possibilities. Unable to tolerate authoritative or academic hypocrisy, he armors himself with the sword and shield of intellectual arrogance and gives battle to anyone and everything around him. What troubles him the most is the dark pain of abuse in his youth and it is here he is most vulnerable. Robin Williams who portrays Dr. Sean Maguire give one of his most stirring performances as a sensitive and compassionate psychiatrist. Equally matched as they are adroit, the two battle in an emotional arena, each seeking to fathom the other. The result? The creation of a truly remarkable film. ****",

Basically I finally watched this movie because Robin Williams was in it. Yep. And as it turns out, Williams and Stellan Skarsgård were the only aspects of this movie that I liked. Their characters had a lot of interesting interactions, depth and emotional intensity. Minnie Driver was an interesting, non-classical beauty choice for Will's love interest and was played well. But Damon as Will Hunting and Affleck were just grating. First of all, I find it completely annoying when characters are constantly lighting up cigarettes and smoking. Yuck. Other than that, Will Hunting's toothy smarmy smiling was just, ugh. I suppose if you find Matt Damon handsome, maybe that would be considered attractive somehow, the big toothy grin but for me, it was just another smarmy aspect to the character of Will. I don't understand the title of the film, what does it really explain about the character of Will ? Was he supposed to be a good guy ? He seemed like an arrogant jerk to me. And even though Sean the therapist finally gets through to Will via a carefully built up friendship and a scene culminating in ""it's not your fault"" that makes Will break down and cry...it seemed to me to be rather quickly resolved trauma in one short scene. Like maybe writers Ben Affleck and Matt Damon realized the story ran too long (it did) and it was time to wrap it up already with some kind of neat resolution. They were considerably young when they wrote this movie and although the role of Sean was a nicely written father figure/therapist portrayal, the rest of the movie lacked depth.

The first problem has four parts which involve finding an adjacency matrix, a new matrix after 3 walks in G, and generating two functions for walks. To be fair, the average moviegoer wouldn't know what the problem is about, but it would be no problem for a graduate-level math student. The second problem asks for the number of trees with n labeled vertices and to draw all homeomorphically irreducible trees with n = 10. An undergraduate student who has taken discrete math and/or graph theory would be able to solve this problem as well. The extra attention to detail of assigning the class a genuinely difficult problem for a graduate- level mathematics course would've given the film more credibility, without feeling like it was ""dumbed down"" for the general movie-going audience.",

It tells a story of a young man who doesn't know his place in life and wastes most of it drinking in a bar with friends, getting into fights occasionally and doing some crappy jobs. And literally no one would blame him for it, we've all been there. But one day a time comes along and it gives you people who challenge you to get out of your shell and find your path, help you become a better person. I think everyone needs something like this movie in his life to re-evaluate it and see it in the different light.
Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's script, although a bit predictable and immature, is almost perfect despite that. The story gives you everything you want from a movie, it gives you time to roll on your back with laughter and to cry your eyes out, gives you food to think and thoughts to hold on to. Robin Williams is brilliant, he's phenomenal, he's the best thing in this movie and his closing line - amazing. Took the words right out of my mouth. Matt Damon's performance is near perfection and one of the best in his career.

Albert Einstein is mentioned several times in the movie as a parallel to Will Hunting, but don't forget that Eintein said, that to become a genius, you need 2% inspiration and 98% transpiration. What makes it even worse is that Will not only masters mathematics but history, literature, chemistry etc. as well.

Some parts that didn't go over well: Matt Damon, in an earlier scene, beats another tough guy to a pulp during a brawl on the basketball court. Later on, he gets manhandled by the out-of-shape Robin Williams and looks scared to death as the older guy has a grip on his throat. It was also unintentionally funny, right before this incident, when Robin Williams tells him he can bench press 280 lbs. In your dreams, pal - you are a small, hunched over, out-of-shape middle-aged dude. Also, Williams' character was ready to kill Will because he disrespected the memory of his deceased wife. A short time later, he laughs as he describes how his late wife loudly farted all the time, even in her sleep. How endearing.Then there's the scene where Matt tells off a stuck-up guy in the bar by giving him a history lesson from 1770. Like, anyone in a bar cares. Then, he gets Minnie Driver's phone number and it's a big trophy; an accomplishment. You would need very thick beer goggles to ask for her number.

Will Hunting is a janitor at the institution of technology and he has a photographic memory. He is discovered solving mathematics problems that students fail to solve. His boozing and fighting land him in jail until he is bailed out by a professor who wishes to use his talent. He is set up with numerous therapists whom he makes fools out of until he is met with one who refuses to turn away. Good screenplay only falters with repetition but it is a superb achievement by Gus Van Sant. He previously made such intriguing films as Drugstore Cowboy and To Die For. Matt Damon is excellent as Hunting whose attitude buries nasty scars that predictably arise from his past. Robin Williams counters repetition by delivering one of his best performances as the psychiatrist who utters those powerful lines, ""It's not your fault."" Minnie Driver is Hunting's girlfriend who is a student but also cares enough to endure his pain until she cannot anymore. Stellan Scarsgard as the professor introduces the plot and receives hard facts. Ben Affleck plays Damon's friend on the wrong side of the track who will advice Will Hunting to travel the right road. It is a great film about coming to terms with yourself and your past. Score: 9 / 10",

The acting is exceptional and in some ways the writing is fine as well. However, given my background as an individual therapist, the movie is a mess psychologically speaking. First, although I generally like Robin Williams in the movie, his physical attack on the main character (though deserved) would result in him losing his license. I have felt like hitting many clients--particularly sociopaths like Will but it just can't occur in real life--particularly since a guy like Will would also be the type to make sure the police and licensing board found out ASAP! Second, given that Will is a sociopath (he has all the signs of an Antisocial Personality), he would not be cured by the end of the flick. Many therapists feel that antisocials cannot be successfully treated while those who DO feel treatment will help would never think about doing short-term therapy with such a vicious powder keg.

His performance as Will Hunting - a genius who just doesn't fit into society and ends up as a janitor at MIT instead of a student - was fabulous, and made the movie worth watching. Unfortunately I personally didn't think there was much else fabulous about this. The story was modestly interesting, and the viewer certainly does want to know what eventually happens to Will. The ending was, strangely, both appropriately and unfortunately ambiguous, as Will leaves behind an opportunity to ""make it"" in order to pursue love. I say ""appropriately"" because the lack of resolution seemed to fit with the rest of his life, and ""unfortunately"" because it left me with no clear knowledge of what happened to him. The movie also raises valid questions about what it means to ""fit in."" Will didn't, because he wasn't doing what everyone thought he should do with his life, but - on the other hand - maybe that was just Will.

166,30 June 2022,dstan-71445,1, Over hyped,"PROS:The writing of the movie is impeccable (the screenplay written by Damon and Affleck!!!). It is a story about a genious man with a traumatic childhood who believes that he knows everything because of his intelligence but in reality doesn't allow anyone to be close to him aside from his friends and dismisses every gift that he has been given. Matt Damon portrays this troubled young being impressively well as an arrogant and selfish man in the beginning but in the end he eventually lowers his defense in a emotional way.
The perfomance of Robin Williams is flawless. He shines in lots of scenes and specifically when he puts Damon's character in place by telling him that he sneers at moments that he has no real life experience (monologue in the park). He is the man that guides him to move on with his life but also learns to keep his own wounds behind.
Ben Affleck gives a strong perfomance by playing a supportive friend who desires the best for his buddy. Stellan Skarsgard and Minnie Driver add more complexity with their portrayal into Damon's character.
CONS:The way that the movie depicts the intelligence of Will Hunting is a little forced and unrealistic",

Good Will Hunting Directed by Gus Van Sant, contains such an incredible screenplay written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. The plot is simply based on a genius who isn't living to his potential due to the traumatic impact of his past. For a topic which has been attempted countless times in film history, Good Will Hunting still holds the benchmark. Each and every word of the script is perfection. Moments of outrage as well as moments of therapy contain some of the most well written lines in cinema. Robin Williams' performance was truly inspiring. His line delivery has a way of transcending the screen and connecting with the audience on a deep, emotional level. I say this is my favourite film due to the fact that it is talented film making in its barest form. All that is required is a great script and talented performances, in order to create such a timeless film. This movie holds up incredibly well. Age hasn't made it less powerful or emotionally outdated. This is one of the very few films which actually impacted my personal life and changed my mindset. The bleak visuals together with Elliot Smith's melancholy music, establishes such a beautiful, sorrowful tone throughout the entire runtime. Not once do I ever believe I am watching a film whilst sitting through Good Will Hunting. The realism and authenticity is unbelievable. If you haven't seen Good Will Hunting, you're currently deprived from one of the greatest films in history. This film repeatedly leaves me in awe each and every time I experience it.

The plot of course has the title character (Matt Damon) finding his way in life with the help of Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, and Stellan Skarsgard also do quite well in their roles. I'll never forget Williams's comment when he accepted his Oscar (""Thank you Ben and Matt. I still want to see some ID."") Like so many other movies (pretty much every one except the illogical ""Gerry""), this certainly shows Gus Van Sant to be a great director. If this movie had any bad sides, it was that it paved the way for Ben Affleck starring in ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" (not to mention the whole ""Ben and Jen"" thing; thank God that's over with).",

It won't change anything. I have an IQ of 140. Not extraordinary, but not so bad either. This is how intelligent people are represented in our society. Every film one sees about this subject touts the virtues of the retard, and deprecates and misrepresents the smart. The ultimate example of this stuff, The Mighty, last year's film starring Sharon Stone tells the story of her son (in the movie), who is a sickly boy who will soon outgrow his bones. His organ will be too large for the space between the bones and he'll die. And he does. The only mitigating factor is that he meets a boy his age who is all muscle and no brains. Together with this boy Stone's son can get about. It's like the old joke ""Well, I'm the bum whole and if I shut down operations, you'll all be in torture, including you stupid brain!

Are we supposed to accept that since Ben Affleck's character isn't as smart as Matt Damon's, he should be satisfied with his lot in life where as Mr. Smarty Pants should claim his rightful place in the heirarchy of society? So, when some dumb kid sees this movie, he's suppost to say to himself, ""You know, I'm not as smart as Will. I'm more like his friend. So, I really shouldn't worry about succeeding in life. Like Ben Affleck's character, I should be happy working construction while my smart friend needs to get motivated and succeed.""

It's a master piece.,"Over-praised melodrama of a gifted math-whiz who loves to flaunt his gift, but when approached about it, plays it off with an annoying ""Don't bother me"" attitude. After a street fight, the whiz (grumpy Damon) is actually given exemption from sentencing, provided that he dazzle a teacher as to why he's so good with numbers. The kid is so closed off that he's actually remanded to counseling with a hot-shot shrink to help open him up. The rest is a dull exchange of dialogue over several sessions until (lo and behold) the kid opens up and becomes a better person. Yay. Another one of those ""realism"" scripts, where they think the F-bomb dropped every other word is effective character building. Please. Plus some painfully forced macho moments, such as Damon spouting an endless deluge of analysis on the art of the pick-up, and his lackluster taunting of a rival. ""Do you like apples? I got her phone number. How do you like those apples?"" Congrats, gasbag, you got some flat-chested Englishwoman's phone number. Someone call the Smithsonian. Rent ""Good Will Humping"" instead.",

Dr. Thorne mentioned a small detail about his dead wife.
One of his wife's worst faults is that she always farts when she's asleep.
The wife herself did not know this.
Once, she made so much noise that she woke herself up. She simply asked her husband, puzzled, what was that noise? Is that the dog barking outside?
Dr. Thorne nodded. He didn't deny it. He didn't have the heart to embarrass his wife, so he put up with the little flaws.
He said:
""It's those little things that make her my wife. And she knows all my little flaws. People call them imperfections, but they're not. That's a good thing.""
In fact, there is no absolutely perfect person in the world, when blaming each other, who can guarantee that there is no shortcomings?
If you magnify your shortcomings, your marriage will be dragged down one day. Only by tolerating each other and embracing each other can you be truly fulfilled and happy.
After all, the truth about marriage is never 1+1=2, but 0.5+0.5=1.
When you walk down the aisle, everyone has to throw away half of themselves to accommodate half of each other.
Therefore, edges and corners are to avoid, otherwise, will hurt each other, will hurt themselves.

I had a hard time believing it when I read it, too. Something that made it easier to believe what that I read in the trivia section that they originally wrote it as more of a Hollywood-like film, with government conspiracies and such. Luckily, they were advised to drop everything but the core drama. The result is this very interesting and thoroughly entertaining film. The story of one young man with vast, unused talent. Like many other dramas, this is based primarily in the dialog and the characters. Some of the most interesting scenes in the film are those where you see the interaction, the conversations between Damon and Williams. They play off each other very nicely. Gus Van Sant's fairly vague and undistinguished directorial style fits the story well, and I really enjoyed the usage of the cameras in the fight scene early in the film. The film has plenty of clever writing, mainly noticeable in the dialog. The plot is very good. The pacing is mostly good, though the film gets a tad slow every once in a while. Near the end I felt like it could have been shorter without hurting the film. The acting is all top-notch, though some of the dialects could have used a bit more work. Something that bothered me a bit about the end was how inconclusive and yet Hollywood-like it was. We don't really know what happens to Will Hunting after the film... but we get the feeling that he's going to be fine. I prefer the ending to 8 Mile, which was a good bit more ambiguous. In the end, a pretty good writing debut, and a solid directing effort by Van Sant. I recommend this to fans of dramas and the various names involved in it. 8/10",

Williams has the ability in his movies to either totally take control of a scene, or to sit back and play off the other actors (I can't wait for Insomnia.)

Basically Will Hunting (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated (for actor) Damon) is a lowly janitor at a South Boston college, a bit of a rebel with his friends, including Chuckie Sullivan (Affleck) and Morgan O'Mally (Casey Affleck, Ben's brother), and hides a genius talent for memorising facts and solving/proving sophisticated mathematical theorems. It is when Will is facing imprisonment (for attacking a youth and a police officer) that he gets the chance to prove himself for Gerald Lambeau (Pirates of the Caribbean's Stellan Skarsgård). Will can either go to jail, or he can be supervised by Lambeau solving maths theorems, and see a therapist, which he disapproves of and believes he doesn't need, and manages to get rid of eight. Lambeau in desperation calls old college friend, now psychologist Sean Maguire (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Robin Williams), and after their first meeting, Sean is determined to connect with Will and his hostile, sarcastic defence mechanisms. It is after Sean strikes Will with his story of giving up his ticket to the Red Sox in the 1975 World Series (thus missing Carlton Fisk's famous home run in Game 6), instead to find a girl. This encourages Will to try and have a relationship with Skylar (Oscar nominated Minnie Driver). In the end, after quite a lot of bickering with Sean, Lambeau, and Skylar moving to California, Will sees the error of ways, gives up a job he could have got, and sends Sean a thank you note, saying he's going to ""get a girl"". Also starring John Mighton as Tom, Rachel Majorowski as Krystyn, Colleen McCauley as Cathy and The Cave's Cole Hauser as Billy. Damon became a star and obviously became Jason Bourne, Affleck is pretty good as Will's best friend, Skarsgård does pretty well as the teacher, and Driver is good as the English girlfriend, and of course, Williams deserved his Oscar for his subtle performance.

As for Williams, the fact he won an Oscar for what is basically a replay of his ""Dead Poet's Society"" role is baffling to me.  I'd like to think that Oscar rewarded him for his overlooked dramatic performances in World According to Garp, Moscow on the Hudson, Awakenings and The Fisher King--his performances in all of those films blew his ""GWH"" Oscar-winning performance away. Much of this movie is paint-by-numbers (especially the climax).  There were some deeper aspects to Will's life that Damon conveyed with his fine acting, yet they were never explored.  Bottom line:  If the movie had not been described as being ""brilliant"" and ""groundbreaking,"" my expectations would have been lower.

266,9 September 2019,zhyarTheChosen,9, Well,"Good Will Hunting by Gus Van Sant (1997)
Well, is hard to say how beautiful this film is. It really is all about the characters and the script. This film is a drama of big proportions unfolding the complexity of human mind and life. The film shows us Will Hunting as a journey to discover the real self of a human with a great gift and a troubled past that is actually stopping him.
Will Hunting is nobody, someone that works cleaning and in a construction work doing nothing really impulsive in his life; but the professor Lambeau discovered him and his potential as student, a young man that come from a dysfunctional family and gets in trouble for fun.
This is where the movie makes one of their greatest movements, the introduction of a psychologist that can handle with Will's defensive position. Sean played by Robin Williams is the soul of the movie, he is in charge of discover Will's inner feelings and in order to achieve that he gets obligated to open up his heart too.
This is where the real action begins, and by action you know what I mean. Is surprisingly difficult to get to someone that can make you think that you were always wrong in 5 minutes. For Sean it took 1 night of repentance and another number of sessions.
The funny is that despite Will looks like a hard like rock person, he's actually weak and is afraid of everything. Sean needed to share what love means to him, what her wife meant to him and what he passed through when she got sick to fully interpret what is life about.
Will's reality is that, as we saw with Skylar, he's afraid of losing someone that he loves, and there are many reasons. He was abandoned by the ones that were supposed to love him the most and fell in families full of abuse and violence
And the only and most difficult thing to do is to accept that is not his fault to actually be like he is, his personality is a combination of the way he reacts to events and the events that he went through. And even when sometimes is not easy, humans are much stronger than you can think.
Talking about the script, is a masterpiece written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, with powerful messages to deliver and a set of words and letter that are not doing anything more than making you empathize with some of the best-developed characters in my film experience.",
267,7 September 2018,gaxiola_fk,10, Masterpiece in script and acting.,"GOOD WILL HUNTING, even though there really aren't any narrative surprises, is filled with wonderful dialogue and bolstered by strong performances.

Together with the help of an MIT professor (Stellan Skarsgard) and a psychologist (Robin Williams) he comes to understand his true potential. The best parts of the film are the many dialogue scenes, some emotionally deep and others biting, that add so much depth to the characters. This was a passion project for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, and it shows. The dialogue felt natural and true to life, which adds to the authenticity of the overall experience. Though everyone (including Ben Affleck) turns in an excellent performance, Matt Damon and Robin Williams are especially good. Matt Damon is the hard-headed young adult who is afraid to let people in, and Robin Williams is a professor with experience and insight that he uses to get to Will. Even though the narrative structure wasn't the tightest, there was something to enjoy about every scene, and all of them added something to the overall picture. I should also mention that Minnie Driver does a great job as Will's girlfriend, and Casey Affleck has a few of the best lines.

I think the final 10 minutes of the movie is arguably the most powerful because it leaves the the viewer saying to themselves ""wow, this is it, this is the end of a young mans routine in which he's done everyday for his entire life, what's next""? That final question you ask yourself is so powerful because the director allows the viewer to becomes so ""obsessed"" and comfortable with Will's everyday routine, and now he's moving on to bigger and better things.

'Good Will Hunting' isn't a great Oscar-worthy movie most critics pointed it out to be, but just a very good film with some good acting performances.

They screw around, get drunk and beat people up -- they are real 'nothings' to society. But, Will has a secret -- he's a genius. He works as a janitor at Harvard University and one day solves a ""said-to-be"" impossible math problem put up by the brilliant Math professor (played by Stellan Skarsgaard in a strong performance). Will then becomes the math professor's new hero and is destined for greatness, but will Will abandon his friends to better his own life? Robin Williams steals the show in an electrifying performance as Will's psychiatrist and Minnie Driver provides good acting as Will's British Harvard girlfriend. Gus Van Sant's directing is fair and the writing is pretty solid for the most part (but nothing Academy Award worthy). The bottom line is that 'Good Will Hunting' is a very good film where the good points more then out-weigh the bad points, but it's nothing spectacular. I recommend it. Grade: B",

It was at best mediocre.  Did it just appeal to people because they think they are really smart and have never expressed themselves, so they identify with some character who has an inherent knowledge of differential equations and sociology.  Nothing was believable in this movie: the love, the pain, the character, or the premise.  Ben Affleck's character was the only redeeming quality in the movie.  Robin Williams did his worst acting job since Mork and Mindy.  It was just a movie about a boy who lacked complexity and was ""wicked smart"".",

287,3 July 2011,patbuchanan-1,1, Utter tosh,"Here again is a film to which an extraordinary number of IMDb reviewers react with either jubilant enthusiasm as though it heralded the Second Coming or utter disdain as though all involved should be lined up against the nearest wall and shot. And neither reaction says anything at all useful about the film (or any other these others which elicit the same kind of response) but merely indicates yet again that a sense of proportion seems to elude a frightening number of people. Perhaps I am being too much of the buttoned-up Brit, but such extremes do nothing but gradually and surely devalue the credibility of contributors. In this reviewer's humble opinion Good Will Hunting has one or two forgivable flaws, but is overall an entertaining success. I suppose almost everyone here will know that back story of how two childhood friends and aspiring actors, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, were so fed up with getting nothing but bit gigs that they decided to write their own screenplay. In fact, their determination was such that once their agent had finally managed to find a buyer, they turned him down when they realised they would not have the degree of control over the production they wanted. And judging by what was finally made, they were right to hold out as they did. It would be easier to list what I regard as the few flaws first as they are minor and can be easily overlooked in what is otherwise an entertaining and often moving story. Damon is the tearaway from South Boston who is — this we have to accept as no proof is given — a mathematical genius with a photographic memory but who as an orphan who was regularly beaten by his stepfather finds it impossible to let go and allow someone to get close, in short who has a lamentably low self-esteem. Affleck is one of three childhood buddies with whom Damon likes nothing better than hanging out, getting drunk and getting into trouble with the police. Then there is Stellan Skarsgard as an MIT mathematics professor who discovers Damon's gift and tries to help him, in the process enlisting a college friend, Robin Williams's counsellor who can relate to Damon in that he has never been able to come to terms with the death from cancer of his wife several years earlier. The story is, in fact, quite simple: Williams does, in fact, finally manage to break through Damon's shell and Damon comes good. My slight gripe is that is is all a little glib, a little easy, a little like a textbook. In the real world the Damon character might be expected to be far more of a loner and far less sociable than he is portrayed. And Williams's success in getting through to Damon seems to encounter no setbacks — well, one ever so slight one — before Damon is 'healed' and takes off to claim the love of a good woman who also tried to help him. Given how entertaining the film is and, as I say, even quite moving, my gripes are perhaps a little harsh, for there is a great deal which is outstanding. Even though Damon and Affleck wrote the script, this is in no way a vanity project and it feel more like an ensemble production than anything else. Damon makes his character likable and sympathetic, and you root for him to come good (as, this being Hollywood, you always know he will). Williams shows once again that beneath the manic clown is a rather good actor (he was especially good with Al Pacino in the remake of Insomnia), and he, too, convinces as the psychologist (I think) who gains as much from his encounter with Damon as Damon does. Good Will Hunting is more than credible and the subsequent success of Damon and Affleck (and Casey Affleck, Ben's brother who plays another of the gang) shows this was no flash in the pan. From me it gets a seven.",

290,17 January 2019,as-88306,10, A star-making performance.,"Will Hunting is a rebellious and resentful adolescent, who likes to always be in his friends' company, drinking beer, beating Harvard's boys and knowing girls. What makes Hunting different from the other youths of his age, besides the money and his behavior's problems,is that the boy is owner of a brilliant intelligence, what makes him capable to solve difficult and challenging mathematical problems, to decorate parts of books and many other things.He reads Marx, Pope, Kant and many other famous authors. Will doesn't know how to guide his capability in a productive way, but after a mathematics teacher discovers the boy's potential, he decides to take him to Sean McGuire( Robin Willians,  who wrongly robbed Burt Reynolds' statue in the Oscar night), a hard, intelligent but sensitive psychologist, who has just lost his wife. The two end up building a true friendship, based on trust, and Will will have to evaluate his life and  choose among continuing to go on with his simple life or to open himself for the brilliant future that waits for him... Matt Damon, a young actor, wrote this excellent drama's plot,together with his friend Ben Affleck. In the hands of director Gus Van Sant, ""Good Will Hunting"" stayed faithful to the original ideas of the young stars, and it consecrated them as two great promises,due to their latent talent and charisma. Robin Willians gives a contained and thrilling interpretation ,building with effectiveness  a psychologist full of sorrow who, slowly, rediscovers the pleasure that life offers for those who want to get it. Actress Minnie Driver is excellent, portraying the girl who falls in love with Will and tries to make the boy surrender to the love! Gus Van Sant tried to avoid the exaggerations that marked his previous films, and he conducted with professionalism and talent a great film that teaches us something:for more difficult than life sometimes is is, if we count with values such as friendship, love, trust and pardon, is still possible to ennoble the world. Reaching the adolescent and adult public, ""Good Will Hunting"" is a thankful surprise!!watch the film, you will like it!!",

292,26 March 2015,willcundallreview,8, A very good movie with a very good cast,"This is a classic film in my opinion, right up next to the Breakfast Club. It is one that will never go out of style, and will never stop being great. Matt Damon is a phenomenal actor, and really dives right into this character in the best way. The supporting characters are also phenomenal and you almost immediately become attached to them, and want to see them grow. The script is very well-done, with snarky little phrases and witty remarks scattered throughout. Again, something that will never go out of style. The storyline is so compelling. You really get to see Matt Damon's character grow and change into this phenomenal man. I think all audiences love to see that in movies- major character growth. I originally started watching this movie for Matt Damon, and because I had heard of it many times before but never watched it. And I am glad I finally made the time to watch it. The styling was one of my favorites from any movie I have seen thus far. The costumes were fun and matched each character perfectly, I loved getting to see Matt Damon's character's friends outfits especially. Overall, a great film and a classic that everyone should watch. It is lighthearted but impactful, and I think it would appeal anyone, not matter which type of film is your favorite. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fun friday night movie.",

298,9 May 2023,Mymoviediscography,9," ""Good Will Hunting"": A Classic Tale of Brilliance, Growth, and Friendship","""Good Will Hunting"" is a 1997 drama directed by Gus Van Sant starring Matt Damon and Robin Williams. Certain films you watch will have an indescribable impact on you. Period. That is the short but indisputable truth, and I dare to claim that every single movie loving cinephile has at least one title that has changed their life forever and will always be in their heart as such. As I have expressed often enough, such films as ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Dead Poets Society"" have had this exact effect on me, but there are also some titles that mean the same to me (or even more) but I don't give enough credit for. This happens to be the case with this magnificent drama. My affection for it dates back to roughly two years ago when I watched it during a personally shaping phase, the summer after graduating from high school and before starting my new job, a short but significant period. Boy, during this time I made some precious memories, and one of them was the first time watch of that very movie. As I was today, I have been blown away by the pure ingeniousness that underlies everything in this production, and it also afterwards has drawn my attention to another certain Robin Williams film that changed my life for the better (Hint: Carpe Diem!). As you can probably guess from the way I formulated the previous sentences, this isn't the only aspect about it that makes it so special for me, because later on I met someone special who changed my life forever as well and whose favourite film of all time happens to be exactly this one. Yes, this film has several connotations to me and thus it is one I will never get tired of. Even though the situation has changed drastically since then and I am no longer in touch with this indeed special person, I thought I'd commemorate her and the past we shared by watching her favourite movie of all time on what happens to be her birthday. I think by now it is obvious that this is without a doubt the most personal review I've ever composed, but what to expect from a passion that bases its existence on the purest of emotions? Watching movies is never a thing of neutrality or detachment, feelings are always in play and I'd be lying to deny that and, in this case, not to mention at least once that it is also a personal issue. All sentimentality and personal attachments put aside, it is still outstanding as a cinematic achievement, nevertheless. To this day, it utterly amazes me to know that the film's basic idea and script were part of a playwriting class that Damon took. Not only is it totally inspiring, but also another proof that even the smallest ideas can make it to the big screen, in this case by the help of his best friend and co-star Ben Affleck, as well as Kevin Smith. There's barely a negative thing I could say about this film, as it is indeed perfect to me. With it, the screenwriter duo cemented their place in Hollywood and became famous, and for a reason. In their opus magnum, they combine everything a first-class drama needs and does all of that in the most professional manner possible. To be honest, I currently cannot come up with a screenplay more original and ingenious then this one. The major reason for this film's huge success is without a doubt the way everything is worded. Not only is it infinitely authentic, the lines are all extraordinarily intelligent to the very last one. Every dialogue delivered isn't only intellectual but also incredibly powerful and fascinating. I can't even decide which sequence is my favourite. They are all so brilliant. The scene Will lambastes that guy in the bar after he has made his best friend look stupid? Jaw-dropping. The sequence when Sean lectures his client about true love? Made my flesh crawl! The ""It is not your fault"" part? I cried like a baby! And those are only the most outstanding of them all, the fascination is an endless aspect in this matter. Mainly, because the film isn't only a conflation of a few dramatic acts, it is much more. I absolutely adore how this film depicts that intelligence isn't a matter of financing, but giftedness and devotion. Titular protagonist Will Hunting is only a wastrel from South Boston for most people, and the neighbourhood he lives in and the friends he meets with validate this impression on first sight, but beneath all this a genius, an uncut diamond lies dormant. From maths to medicine, over law and economics there is not a single thing he didn't teach himself via books, and the fact that he is the only one who solves a mathematical equation (twice!) only proves again that intellect is a matter of dedication and diligence. Despite everything he knows in theory, there is still much he doesn't understand, and that's where the dramatic aspect comes into the picture. As a result of his upbringing in poor circumstances, he was only able to acquire booklore and simply lacks the knowledge of experience. This is were the old conflict of upper class vs. underclass shows to advantage. Deep inside, he is a boy genius with an enormous potential who has everything it takes to be someone who will change the world, but the underprivileged conditions he was raised on made him the problematic boy he is. He is reckless, at times cantankerous, uncouth, cocky and most importantly, not aware of his own capabilities. This young man is the product an unusual environment, exactly what happens when two worlds collide, but he doesn't belong to any of them. He needs someone who guides his way and that's where Professor Lambeau and Sean Maguire come into play. While the first helps him realize his talent in a more practical, more work-orientated way, the latter shows him how to deal with his live in in its most minimal facets. The most fascinating aspects about those two mentors is how they teach him the most important things, but also still learn a lot from him as well. Thus, each and every character develops in a wonderful manner and isn't the same they used to be in the beginning. During the therapy lessons with Sean, he is gradually taught how to deal with the things one cannot learn from books, such as love and relationships. This comes in handy when Will gets to know his British girlfriend Skylar he experiences those totally new things with. Simultaneously, we also learn more about his troubled past and how he has experienced physical abuse. All this makes his eclectic character perfectly realistic, lifelike and likeable despite his imperfections. Like with every other remarkable drama, all of this would be in vein without stellar performances. Next to Skarsgard and Affleck (of which latter was known as the dumb friend of Will Hunting for a long time after) who both shine in their small but important supporting roles, also Minnie Driver convinces with her mainly minimalistic but not less brilliant acting, but the without a doubt most outstanding performances are delivered by Damon and Williams. Individually, they already deliver what is justifiably considered as cinematic history and show their versatility and enormous acting range, but together they are even more excellent and a true powerhouse of dramatic acting. They start out as incongruous individuals but form an unlikely bond and eventually a special friendship. As if the star power and acting ability of the cast wasn't already enough, the film also offers enough technical features that make it even more terrific. Next to the impressing musical score by Danny Elfman, the cinematography coveys the feeling of extreme intimacy and the underlines the vulnerability of its characters, as it mainly consists of closeup shots that enable this effect. All in all, this outstanding drama is by far one of the most original and best conceptualised movies I have ever seen. What started out as a simple homework for a playwriting class, ended up becoming a touching drama that combines great acting with its wonderfully written script. Even if it plays with its tonal directions, and includes scenes of drama, humour, and optimism, it never becomes a mess while doing so and doesn't unnecessarily pull at the viewer's heartstrings. A wonderfully paced and heart-warming film that has it all to be called a perfect masterpiece. I am absolutely in awe of the story, the characters and the film as a cinematic achievement in general. Truly an inspiring piece of art and the proof that the lady I mentioned in the beginning has a phenomenal taste in movies.

Williams and Damon are excellent, and the script is well written and smart, although it turns a bit too sentimental for my taste at the end of over two hours. Van Zant could have tightened up the editing; noisy bar scenes are always an unnecessary tool; and there are at least one too many in Good Will Hunting. Even with its slight defects, the film is well worth watching.",

332,20 November 2022,Reviews_of_the_Dead,8, Interesting Look at Intelligents and Humanity,"This is an intense movie and includes many strong performances, capped off by Robin Williams's, which is probably the best cinema performance of his career. The movie deals with a lot of social and psychological themes - denial, repression, social marginalization, self-esteem, love - without becoming corny or a spoof. That is, the story can be taken seriously, and for Hollywood, which has a track record of reducing event he most complicated issues to the most simplistic level, this is a major accomplishment. The title character, Will, played admirably by Matt Damon, really serves as a metaphor for every person unable to actual their potential. Minnie Driver's performance is especially powerful, but this is Robin Williams's movie. His performance as the treating psychiatrist who is able to break through Will's resistance and defenses may be the positive portrayal of a mental health therapist in cinema history. This movie should be watched by anyone who is interested in mental health and by the public in general because this movie is about us.",

337,11 June 2015,estebangonzalez10,10, Robin Williams best performance thanks to an incredibly solid script.,"The script has the merit of bringing in its very well-developed narrative structure a collection of striking dialogues, such as when Sean recalls how he met his beloved wife and in his amusing recollection of the couple's idiosyncrasies, being also responsible for creating and developing ambiguous and complexes like Will and Sean himself, escaping the pitfalls common to this type of film, which usually seeks easy crying through Manichaean plots in the story. Not here: the situation builds up little by little, slowly, until, finally, we realize that something has changed. And that's precisely what's most interesting about Matt Damon's script and performance. His Will Hunting, an extremely troubled and arrogant young man, is changing so slowly that we are not able to perceive this transition until it is practically affected. Damon's acting is subtle, powerful. The scenes where he discusses love, sex, fate and loneliness with Robin Williams are perfect.",

Matt Damon's (Will) performance as the troubled working-class genius in need of guidance is excellent. However, I think that this was too much of a feelgood movie and an endorsement of counselling, for it to be a truly great film. I found Minnie Driver's (Skylar) expressionless English accent thoroughly irritating and it destroyed, for me, the possibility of the romance between Will and Skylar being interesting.",
340,23 December 2001,andy67uk,7, Promising screenwriting debut but an overrated movie.,"This is the incredible story of Will a working class young boy who besides working as a janitor first and in the building construction afterwards, is also a genius in mathematics and several other scientific fields which he learned all by himself. But simultaneously he is a petty delinquent for which he has already got a criminal record mainly for assaulting other people in street fights with the likes of him. Despite being a real genius he is also an insecure boy fearing life and love due to the very unhappy childhood he had, which makes it very hard that he can take advantage of his intellectual ability. It also leads him to be rude to those who want to help him since he doesn't trust anybody. All through the movie we see the work of the two men who try to bring him to life and to take conscience of his own value: a maths professor and above all a psychiatrist who had his own problems in life too. This is shown in a brilliant way in terms of players' performances, images and dialogues with deep analysis of feelings and behaviours. All the players are excellent. A special reference to Minnie Driver as the boy's girlfriend with her spiritual and intelligent look and her moving reactions to some of Will's difficult to understand attitudes. This story is genuine indeed in terms of sentiments and actions and very well put on film. One of the best movies of its year.",

It's been hyped up by so many people in the media, that the viewers are actually getting convinced that Matt Damon is the new miracle giving Hollywood new hope and glory, but it is quite the opposite. As an actor I think he's not convincing enough, maybe in the first part of the movie he seems to be able to let you forget he's just an actor, but at the end of the movie he starts to act out his character in such a way it actually brings down all what he did in the first part. As the writer of the screenplay he's not such a star either, again the beginning is okay, but the ending seems like a bad headache after a night of partying. The only truly remarkable thing about this movie is the excellent and undervalued performances by Robin Williams and Ben Affleck. Matt Damon and Minnie Driver should have been the last choices for their characters.",

355,5 December 2020,keshby3636,3," Yeah, as bad as I remembered.","It's very predictable that a movie like this would soon be placed into that undefined category of ""good"" recent movies, which includes any film having the smallest bit of sincerity and meaning. The fact that the popular trend is toward the visual and that special effects are replacing plots and subtle nuances tends to lead the average viewer to the opinion that any film that attempts these is a grand effort. This is not true. ""Good Will Hunting"" does not even have a well-defined plot, but that fits into the movie acceptably: it's an extraordinary man's search for himself through love, psychoanalysis, and philosophy. The premier problem is that the movie overplays it's best card: Matt Damon's(character's) incredible brain. There is a certain point at which the audience should halt its fascination at his mental profencies and sigh in boredom. It's unfortunate that this was not the case for most theaters. Though the meaning of life and gifted individuals are good themes for movies, they are not original, and this ""tear-jerker"" makes no unique contributions to either idea. In fact, if you want to see real meaning in a popular movie, rent ""Rocky"", a title which many supposed ""film experts"" would probably not want to admit conveys deeper human meaning than most ""good"" movies, like (appropriately) Good Will Hunting.

And the acting is perfectly judged. The film has so many things going for it. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are superb, and they just gel so well on screen. Their gang of friends is lewd and crude but very affectionate and best of all, they swear authentically and talk in native accents. Robin Williams is a strong character as usual but most of the time is quite restrained, and acts well off other characters. Stellan Skarsgaard is perfectly convincing as a wily mathematics professor who is an old friend and rival of Williams' character. Minnie Driver acts well and has some great scenes, but I think her character is too much of ""the love interest"" -- it's a pity.

This questioning present in the film is what shapes his moral, which is to conjecture the sense of friendship and life, to Will friendship defines life, and his best friend makes him see that he has a bright future and that is not worth it The stagnation in exchange for his friendship, thus showing himself, really, a great and faithful friend, love is put on agenda and even the choices of life itself, because sometimes what the heart says is worth more than reason, Even so, the feature gets very focused on Will's character and leaves all those messages aside, including Professor Sean's character, who is fabulous and extremely three-dimensional. The film plays a lot with the camera, we have a lot of zoom in and out, quick cuts and frames changes, and a very expensive gray photograph from the 80s - even the movie being 97 - the soundtrack is little present but director Gus Van Sant plays with visual references and uses the culture to mock the viewer, when smarter, more blind and more being manipulated and lost, is a questionable message, but the film explains it very well for the viewer more attention. Matt Damon looks great on the role, boyish face, and boy pose and he understands his character as few, even because he wrote it himself, wrote it and knew how to live it, it's not a brilliant and out-of- the-way performance, but it's a great Acting of someone who does not even seem to be acting, just living the character, Robin Williams is wonderful, he passes an air of pure peace mixed with remarkable uneasiness, his character is wonderful.

Do I have to mention how inconsistent it is? Or how stupid? Just from the get go. Anyway, is not that awful and there's a couple of thought provoking lines here and there, and Robin Williams is good, so all hope is not lost.

410,1 April 2015,isaacj-oconnor,8, Robin Williams - well done,"""Good Will Hunting"" is not one of those conventional Hollywood dramas that are filled with sentimental moments, melodramatic situations and stereotypical characters. It is a film that  focuses on realistic characters, their complex lives and the things life has to give them, whether they want them or not. Something every human being can relate too. ""Good Will Hunting"" is a genuinely good film, that has qualities I consider a rarity these days in movies. This may sound over the top, but this movie will most likely be one of the most memorable dramas of the 90`s.  Matt Damon and Ben Affleck`s honest and invigorating script transfers almost perfectly onto the big screen, with the help of director Gus Van Sant. ""Good Will Hunting"" is about a young, cocky but deeply troubled young man named Will Hunting. He lives in South Boston with his street bum friends, but there`s something that separates him from the rest; He`s a genius. After an MIT professor accidentally discovers his gift, Will`s life starts to change, more dramatically than he thinks. Two strangers almost simultaneously then enter Will`s life; Sean Maguire, a widowed psychologist who tries to help Will, played greatly by Robin Williams. And Skylar (played equally as good by Minnie Driver), a vibrant Harvard student who quickly falls in love with Will. Will`s relationship with both them and his blue-collar friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck), all seem to deeply affect him, making it more difficult for Will to realise what he truly needs. The ending of the film sort of leaves you hanging, but you will no doubt me moved. ""Good Will Hunting"" is pretty down-to-earth film, but it is enriched with an indescribable power that is probably generated by all the exceptional performances, the script and Gus Van Sant`s unparalleled direction. A satisfying, powerful and thought-provoking movie.",
411,18 March 1999,Adrian-32,9, Excellent,"A math genius, Will, grows up in the back streets of Boston. Will has never sought any formal education and frequently gets in trouble with the law. He gets a job as a janitor at Harvard University. Between sweeping floors and cleaning toilets, he finds the time to solve extremely complicated math equations. A professor at Harvard attempts to take him under his wing and to save him from his latest prison sentence. The professor guarantees the court that Will will seek psychotherapy. After a number of therapists refuse to work with him, the professor asks an old friend to counsel Will. Enter Sean, Robin Williams, a man who also grew up in the back streets of Boston. Sean is able to relate to the troubled Will, and thus the healing begins I adored this film when it first opened. It had a fresh, funny, emotionally-charged script. The script was written by two young writers, who had lots of potential to become the most celebrated writers in Hollywood. Instead of sticking to the writing, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon chose the easier path. They became ""action"" movie stars on the back of Good Will Hunting and left their writing behind. I always thought that this was a shame, that they didn't stick with writing screenplays. Because of this, I think the film lost some of its initial impact. Don't get me wrong. It is still a notable work. When most audiences watch it, they find themselves cheering Will on, as he ""cuts"" elitist college students down to size. The most hardened and cynical viewers will find it hard not to shed a tear, as Will confronts his past. But what really makes this film masterful is that we are not just told that Will is a Genius. He proves it in every scene. Whether you are listening to his piquant repartee with other characters or his philosophy on life, you are struck by the intelligence of his remarks. The dialogue throughout the film is exceptional. It is earthy and natural (to stay true to the background of Will's character), but it is also adept and sometimes quite, profound.",

The plot is such a simple story of Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a young man with intelligence way beyond his years, yet all he is choosing to do with his life is cleaning the floors at his job and hanging out with his friends. After getting in trouble with the law, college professor Sean Maquire (Robin Williams, in his Oscar-winning role) is the only person willing to counsel him and turn his life around. Maybe I enjoy this film because I relate so well to it, as I am a college student unsure of what to do with my life. The film has rightly been described as a ""slow-burner,"" and I would agree. It was during my second viewing that the film's greatness suddenly hit me, and I really began to like it. It entertains but also brings tears to my eyes. It has the same inspirational value as Robin Williams' earlier film ""Dead Poets Society,"" for which he also should have won an Academy Award.

The film itself is one great scene after another, expertly written and acted in such a way that it reminds me of the Godfather films. The way Sean ( brilliantly acted by Robin Williams) was the only one able to break Will's ( an equally brilliant Matt Damon) tough exterior, really drives the film. The scene in the park where Sean tells Will he knows nothing about life, and that "" when i look at you, i don't see a strong, confident young man, i see a cocky, scared s***less kid."" Great moments like these come one after another and reaches an emotional climax with the "" it's not your fault"" scene. Minnie Driver's performance as Skylar nearly stole the show. I fell in love with her quirky charm, making it all the more dramatic when there relationship reaches a head with another great moment in the film. This is film any film lover should see.

Lucky for Will he does have his friends though, led by Chuckie (Ben Affleck) who supports him throughout the film and finally near the end of the film challenges Will to do better in life because he and the rest of his crew know how much smarter Will is than the rest of his group. It's interesting to note that the Will character, acting wise, came down to a coin flip between Damon and Affleck. If Damon didn't win the coin flip we would have seen Affleck in the role of the troubled genius janitor. Makes you think, doesn't it? Besides Will's crew there's a love story in the movie as Will eventually chases after a Harvard student he picks up in a way at a bar named Skylar played well by English actress Minnie Driver. Robin Williams' performance is something to talk about as well. Winner of the Academy Award in Best Supporting Actor that year for this role, Williams cuts right to the heart as Will's therapist as he can really identify with the troubled youth. The two share life and laughs, and Williams puts forward a very strong performance!! Stellan Skarsgard also puts forward a very good performance in the movie as well. Great acting, a good sound track, outstanding writing that won the duo of Damon and Affleck the Academy Award for Original Screenplay that year, make this a movie not to miss!! 8 out of 10 stars!!",

The fact is, the movie simply spoke to where I was in my life.

Matt Damon it is superb, and it grabs his character (which he wrote) so impressive and credible; Robin Williams in one of his best roles, his character is the most beloved and fun (and a little perturbed), the entire cast does a phenomenal job, Stellan Skarsgård, Minnie Driver, Ben Affleck, all perfect. The film teaches us that we all have a soul mate, not a romantic, but one that challenges us and transforms us what we are in the future ... (I wish have both).

It features one of the greatest screenplays of the last 20 years, written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, full of thought-provoking dialogue and some beautiful monologues, (My personal favourite is from Ben Affleck at the construction site about 3/4 of the way through the film). All the actors are great. Matt Damon perfectly embodies the role that he plays, an immature, cocky yet gifted boy in a world which he believes will wait for and build around him. Robin Williams plays an empathetic, yet gloomy psychologist who has never fully gotten over the death of his wife. Even Ben Affleck-haters will acknowledge Affleck's good work here, as Will Hunting's seemingly bonehead friend, who, as the film goes on, is revealed to be caring, empathetic man. Minnie Driver, Casey Affleck and Stellan Skarsgard round out the cast, all of whom give good performances. The plot is something many of us can relate to: An overconfident, intelligent man who cannot be bothered to realise his full potential. The insecurities of Will Hunting are fleshed out in great detail by the script, Damon's performance and Gus Van Sant's use of close ups for a lot of the major scenes, showing Hunting's emotions in detail. However, in some of the crowd scenes, such as in classrooms, Van Sant lacks a little imagination, resorting to the same camera pan sequence over and over again. Nevertheless, he is a more than capable director who delivers for the most part here. Danny Elfman's use of music adds to the heartwarming factor of the film. The film won two Oscars, Robin Williams winning Best Supporting Actor as well as Damon and Affleck winning Best Original Screenplay. In addition to this, Damon, Van Sant, Driver, Elfman and editor Pietro Scalia, earned nominations for their efforts. The film was also nominated for best original song and best picture. I would recommend this film to anyone, however, parents should be careful with letting their children watch this, as it contains a lot of coarse language as well as frequent sexual references.

I have rated a great many films and TV series but there was one scene in this film that so profoundly affected me, that I had to comment about it. Now I have watched this film several times since it was made and really enjoyed it, but today 12/30/19, I had to comment on this one particular scene in the movie. The scene is when Will is meeting with the NSA guy, regarding why he should join the clandestine agency. First may I say, how ahead of its time Will's explanation is, as to why he should not join the NSA. It is prior 911 and prior to any current scrutiny of these agencies. Will's response to why he shouldn't join the organization is unbelievably prophetic, considering it was written 22 years ago. His explanation of why he shouldn't, should make every proud citizen struggling to survive, question the current standards and practices of our government agencies including and especially our president's. Will's response explains the actions of the agency and its consequences to the average american citizen. So if you are a reasonable adult, who values morality and is now questioning or possibly doubting our current government agencies, politicians and our presidenct due to questionable tactics and policies, please watch this scene in the movie. Just do so with an open heart and mind. PS, by the way I highly recommend you watch the entire movie as it an incredible and enjoyable watch but that scene is like a crystal ball into our current future.

475,30 May 1999,yawow,10, This movie rocks!,"It wasn't that deep- quite entertaining though, as I usually like movies about an exceptionally talented character, featuring some mindgames, or situations where the character makes use of his ""powers"". Yet the sentimental issues the script was struggling to make Will's character more complex with, were just too artificial. I mean you have this boy, great at everything, and then he's voluntarily living his life like a loser, so that he can stay faithful to his friends? And at the end -he goes after his girlfriend, wow, like that's something really deep. In fact, I don't usually make much of a philosophy about movies; in this case there are some interesting ideas, like the one that no matter how much knowledge you acquire, that can't equal true experience, but 1. they're not really new or original, just OK and 2. they are generally connected to Will as a genius, an ultimately unrealistic situation. So as I said, it's cool to watch, but not that thoughtful as it probably aims to be. One last thing- a little goof which made me feel really awkward about the seriousness of the movie makers. I stopped the tape to see the problem written on the board in the hallway- and it took me about 10-15 seconds to solve it. It was hilarious- the problem was to write a simple 3*3 matrix and do some of the most basic, basic operations with it. Not even a problem, an easy exercise- for a 10 year old. And the second problem- I didn't even have to stop the tape there, I mean come on- a problem on which the whole crew of the professor worked for 2 years-2 years!!!- how on earth could be possibly solved with a couple of drawings?? and not a single mathematical symbol?? A couple of simple graphs, that was all. This was so embarrassing it made me seriously reconsider my appreciation of the movie. Not that it is significant- but how hard can it be to get a real mathematical problem-not the the prime-number-formula but Anything which cannot be solved within seconds, and barely Looks like a problem.

Robin Williams does a wonderful job and thoroughly deserved his Oscar. The scene where he gets Matt Damon's character to breakthrough and come face to face with what the root of his problem is is wonderful, and I cry every time I see it. I also love the scene where Matt Damon's character's instincts are shown when he quietly watches when his friend, Ben Affleck's character, tries to pick up Minnie Driver's character. Matt Damon's character quickly realizes that his friend has walked into territory where he is out of his league, and I love when he jumps in and shows his loyalty to his friend and completely embarrasses the arrogant guy from Harvard.

479,7 September 2006,rchrdshelt,8," Despite one or two flaws, worth watching for some excellent performances and a fairly original story","A few words about the script who won 1998 Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay and let's stay in the field of mathematics of non-logical axioms. The two young writers (at the time they wrote the script Matt Damon was 25 years old and Ben Affleck 23) have created utopian characters, as they would have liked to behave, and which cannot be found in real life (based on Damon short experience at Harvard University).
Comparing what the movie tell us and what is confirmed in real life, based on my experience of over 40 years, and especial the last 20, the screenplay is misleading and is based on a perplexing postulate that states that ""If A, B, C are TRUE behaviors of GROUP X then D behavior, which belongs of GROUP X, CAN BE TRUE. For an inexperienced person, D's credibility is no longer disputed and is considered as a true behavior. But D is FALSE because it's the exception of GROUP X. Perplexity decreases when group size increases.
Let's take a few examples:
1. Professor Gerald Lambeau's interest in revealing a superior intelligence even than his own. FALSE behavior. In the university system, and beyond, it is a fierce struggle to secure your supremacy.
2. Chuckie Sullivan concern for Will Hunting's future as a failure. FALSE behavior. We all know that the enemy stabs you in front and the friend in the back.
3. The behavior of the main character itself. If he had such a remarkable mind for mathematics, please believe me, his social behavior would have been quite different.
And the examples could continue.

Robin plays his character really well, and makes this film the success it was, from an actor which seems to me, Has done so many children movies, he comes across like the forever daft laugh a lot actor not to be taken seriously but it was a surprise when i saw him, now i like him. Minnie Driver looks sexy as hell playing Matt Damon's girlfriend, I'm a huge Matt Damon fan, and if you like him, you must own this. Matt Damon Of course is who the movie focuses on, and he proves how well he can play any part given to him, a boy cleaning the school floors is actually the most brightest lad, the school has. Ben Affleck plays will hunting's best friend. & there's abit in the end, which i really liked, between the Damon/Affleck characters which made the end enjoyable. Id Advise this movie for everybody to watch, you will enjoy it if you like a good drama. Written by both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck winning them both their first 2 Oscars.

Although I never really enjoy movies with either of these actors I thought this film was very well done. I give it a 10/10! A film of brilliance, heartbreak, rebellion, and a wild adventure. Knowing that they directed this movie I thought the plot would be awful but it really captured the essence of human nature.

The script, written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, is simply incredible and earned the Best Original Screenplay in the Oscars of 1998. Right from the first scenes there is a break of paradigms which make us realize that Good Will Hunting is not some random film. Along the plot also has a series of social critiques and even the picture being of 1997, these critiques are still current. The director, Gus Van Sant, by choosing a movie style calmer, clean and without many camera movements made the right decision. Another positive aspect of the direction was in certain conversations, the decision to keep a closed camera in the face of some character and slowly opening the plan to show the rest of the scenery. This method was great, because it caught all the facial expressions of the character and even when he was not talking, you could see how he reacted to the other talking, but none of this would be possible if it were not for the brilliant work of the actors.",

Robin Williams is talking to Matt Damon in a stern way telling him the way he goes about everything is that of a coward, but he makes it sound so calming. The way Ben Affleck tells his best friend he has to move on and do something with his life and even gets his friend a car despite his lack of wealth just to see his friend succeed is very moving to see that everyone is helping this one young man.",

489,12 June 2019,fournierse-91783,10, The ups and downs of Will,"Good will hunting played by actor Matt Damon is a young man who works as a janitor staying with his ""brother"" actually best friend. One day while at the university he solves a puzzle left on a board by a math professor and he solved it. This starts showing how smart he is without actually even going to college. His best friend chuckie says ""You know what the best part of my day is? For about 10 seconds from when I pull up to the curb to when I get there to your door, 'cause I think maybe I'll get up there and I'll knock on the door and you won't be there"" he says this to Will because he just throws this talent this gift that's been gifted to him but just chooses to work construction or crappy jobs when he could be doing better. I've watched the movie on my own free time and with my english class. After have seeing the movie more than once you see it from a different perspective in many ways people could feel like Will. He's broke, working a crap job, barely getting by like many of us what is different between us and him is his intelligence the way he can fire up different parts of his brain and the way his brain analyzes the problem the complexity of it all. Will can look at any equation and his mind makes it possible to where it makes sense to him. Scientists say normal average beings use only 10% of their brains while people smarter and more fortunate like Steve hawking, or in this case Will hunting.
The writing is witty yet brilliant for a movie that's come out in 1997 it would seem by the way it was portrayed that it would've and could've been a movie that came out easily in 2007. Good Will Hunting was very hilarious at times, both Matt and Robin Williams preform wonderfully from both a comedic and theatrical prospective. Matt the actor playing Will says ""You wasted $150,000 on an education you coulda got for $1.50 in late fees at the public library."" which became one of his most famous quotes. Letting everyone know not everyone has to go to college to be smart or successful that it's okay not to have all the money in the world as long as you have yourself and you're mind.",
490,30 May 2019,dicruzrivera,10, Great movie.,"The story of this film is so simple (and contrived) , so everyday , so condensated , that you can write the plot summary on the back of a matchbox (!!!) . You see exactly what you KNOW that you will see . Nevertheless the result is very good and effective .",
491,12 July 2001,timefreezer7,8, Good movie (although not a classic),"Matt Damon portrays Will Hunting in the heartfelt movie Good Will Hunting (1997). Will (Matt Damon) works as a custodian at MIT. He secretly observes each class and the material that is taught. When the professor puts certain theorems on the blackboard that seem unsolvable, Will (Matt Damon) goes after hours to solve them. All the professors are baffled by the fact that he can solve the theorems. Although, problems start when Will (Matt Damon) gets into an altercation with a police officer and resists arrest. But to his luck, Professor Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgård) decides to pay his bail under two conditions. One, that he studies advanced mathematics with him. Two, that he receives therapy from another professor at the school.
Throughout the film, we see how Will faces many personal struggles. Such as, starting and ending a relationship with another woman, interviewing for different jobs, and dealing with issues from his early adolescence in his therapy sessions. This films shows the theme of happiness and how it is achieved despite personal struggles depicted by all of the character in some way, shape, or form.
Some strengths that we see in the film are the cast selections and the character development. The cast selection includes two very well known actors: Robin Williams and Matt Damon. Matt Damon is known for playing characters who often have a rough exterior but a good heart. Robin Williams is known for playing humorous characters who are very lovable but can be serious when the need be.
The acting talent is also present in this film. We see many fight scenes with Will (Matt Damon) which tells us a lot about his character but we also see him develop from that as well. We also see his girlfriend, Skylar (Minnie Driver) at the time in pain and sobbing because of Will (Matt Damon) which creates a sense of empathy for her character.
Another aspect of the film that is worth noting is the script and the language that it contains. The script contains a lot of curse words which can be intense for the viewers at times but it is necessary to characterize the era and the environment of the movie.
The music in this film was fitting for the events that were happening. There was often light music to set the scene in the beginning. Also there was calming music in between each scene which made for a smooth transition.
The lighting played an essential part of the film as well. The use of shadows and more obscure lighting was the most frequent in this film. A specific example would be when Will and the professor are in the interrogation room of the jail and since the scene is very intense, the lighting makes both of their facial features more piercing.
The setting of the movie shows Will's house that he lives in. We see that it is very run down and that he lives in a lower class neighborhood. This automatically shows where Will comes from and gives us empathy for him because of his humble beginnings. Then, it shows him when he arrives to the prestigious college of MIT and that is the exact opposite. We also see that he spends most of his time outside of work at the bar in the same neighborhood that he lives in.
The costume and makeup shows us the styles of the time period that this movie was filmed in. But most importantly, it shows a distinction between social classes. We see the difference between social classes when the professors and students at MIT are shown. We see when Will (Matt Damon) goes in for a job interview and he is not dressed to the standards of the employer.
Finally, there were two scenes that were extremely important to the film and they are very much worth analyzing. One, Will's (Matt Damon) very first therapy session with Sean (Robin Williams). We see that even though he is so intelligent and he seems invincible, he still has his troubled childhood and personal struggles that play a part into the way he is. As viewers, we hope to see how his character development plays out from there.
Another scene that is important is when Sean (Robin Williams) talks about how his wife has passed and how she made him so incredibly happy. We see the theme of happiness appear here and we see Will (Matt Damon) express a desire to obtain that same happiness.
Overall, this compelling film was heartfelt and each character was developed with a touch of humanity. We see how personal struggles and happiness fit hand and hand with each other. I truly recommend watching this film.",

493,24 July 2006,TensersFloatingDisk,10, What 'education' really means,"Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is the janitor at the most prestigeous college in the country. He is also the most brilliant person there. He solves incredibly difficult equations in minutes, where it took others years to. He is well read in history, mathematics, and art. But spends his days drinking with his buddies. It is not until one of the professors (Stellan Skarsgard) discovers his genius, that his life starts to turn around for the better. But he also has alot of anger. As a part of Will's probation, he must see a shrink (Robin Williams). Will also meets a girl (Minnie Driver) that seems to be his soul mate. With the help of Sean the shrink and Will's best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck), Will acknowledges his potential and his abandonment issues. This movie is very well written and acted. Most especially by Damon and Williams. It shows that even the most complex person can find solace and understanding in others, if he only opens up. The movie was nominated for 9 Academy awards, it was truly one of those special feel good movies that had a message. And has quickly become one of my favorite films.",

For Will, as a mathematician he likes certainty in all things, and long relationships for him are uncertain. He keeps asking himself whether this girl is right choice and where he would be after. As for Skylar, she seeks for education and she needs from him confirmation of his love. The story tells that the right girl is the one for whom you are willing to sacrifice the most valuable thing.

The recipe is usually the same.  Take a working class loser, make him very handsome, brave, charming, and extremely intelligent, then contrast him against well educated people who are shown to be sexually frustrated, neurotic, and otherwise unhappy, and you create a white-trash hero.  ""Good Will Hunting"" plays this game very effectively.  By the end of the film it has you believing the classic lie that education is unnecessary and all that matters in life is that you get the girl.  Still, a good film at what it tries to do.  However, one should watch an episode of Jerry Springer after seeing this film to remember what uneducated white-trash are really like.",

498,4 April 2020,thebadsa,10, Good,"Every now and then I like to step away from reviewing a new theatrical or Blu-ray release and talk about movies that have already been out for some time now.I,as I'm sure the rest of the world,am still deeply hurt to hear about the tragic death of Robin Williams.So I wanna share my opinions on one of his most celebrated movies and movie roles in Good Will Hunting. William Hunting is a young,South Boston raised punk who works as a janitor at M.I.T.Ironically,despite being ""just a janitor"",Will can solve math equations that baffle even the school's top professors.After anonymously solving a nearly impossible math problem posted in the school halls,he gets the attention of one of the school math professors. With the teachings of Prof. Lamdeau,played by Skarsgard,and regular therapy visits with a community college psychology professor,Will gets the opportunity to really show just what his young brain is capable of while also finding a person he can open up and connect to in, Dr. Sean Macguire played flawlessly by the late,Robin Williams. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck both won Oscars for their screenplay of this movie back when it released and believe me when I say that this movie's script is one of the best in film in my opinion.I know that's a stretch but every character conversation,no matter what the mood of the scene,is filled with interesting and important dialog.I literally won't watch this movie with out subtitles just because I don't wanna risk missing an important piece of info or some character development.There are scenes in this movie that can bring me tears with either sadness or hilarity,this is definitely a layered movie.All this makes the story that much more believable and that of course makes for extremely likable and developed characters.Seriously even minor characters have their moments throughout. With these great characters,you definitely get great performances.Matt Damon is as good as I've ever seen him,he has these one takes where he goes on and on spewing out all this mind numbing but intriguing dialog.Ben Affleck is in this one,however he really plays the secondary character here.That doesn't mean he doesn't get a few good scenes here and there,I actually liked his character as well.Minnie Driver and Stellan Skarsgard both give really good supporting performances as well.As for Mr.Williams,I really don't have to say anything.What more need be said by now,you know? His performance in this movie puts you through so many different emotions as does his character and it works SO effectively,he's perfect! The music by Danny Elfman is subtle but really kicks when it has to and the cinematography is also actually very good after I rewatched this on Blu-ray.Gus Van Sant may not be a houshold name but he really has this way of making the movie seem almost like a documentary sometimes,he brings realism to his films and a lot of welcomed depth to his characters. With this review I'd like to say one last goodbye to my childhood hero,Robin Williams and praise his performance as well as this film that still gets me Every time!You can call it a sympathy rating but I cant help but give this movie a perfect 10/10 because its MY review and despite the circumstances,this is really a GREAT film and I love it.Of course I give GOOD WILL HUNTING MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION.

509,9 July 2013,kulpank,9, Brilliant Movie.,"Good Will Hunting weaves many themes: love, friendship, loyalty, rivalry, class, relationships and intelligence. Considering that this film was also written by Matt Damon & Ben Affleck makes it even more remarkable. What started as a collection of scenes became this modern fable for generation X. Folks might be put off by the language, but it is what makes the film real. Having been in Boston, I have seen the differences between Southies and the upper crust, and Matt & Ben, who I believe are from Boston, really bring this class issue to light. You also see unconditional love & loyalty in the friendship of Matt & Ben (which parallels the Stellan Skarsgard/Robin Williams friendship), and later, in the relationship of therapist Robin Williams with Matt. Matt's lack of vulnerability is his shield in relationships until he meets the premed student as played by Minnie Driver. With her, his walls come down, but he is still wary of exposing his vulnerability and has a fear of commitment. And it is the therapist (Robin Williams) who finally breaks through, teaching Matt about revealing himself. There are many poignant moments in this film; and given the fact that Ben Affleck has been slammed many times for his acting, he gives a sublime, endearing facet to his character's friendship with Matt in his performance. Minnie Driver projects a warmth and intelligence that Matt's character is attracted to. She is an open book, unafraid of falling in love with Will Hunting, and sad when she cannot feel the reciprocation from him. But the real scene stealer is Robin Williams, whose therapist character is similar to Will; southie boy who is wicked smart. The scenes of Matt and Robin are like a well choreographed dance, and I believe that this is some of Robin's best dramatic work since Peter Weir's Dead Poet's Society. Having watched this movie many times, I keep finding new subtleties in all the acting performances. Definitely a must see film!",

I never give him undue bias, because he can definitely be hit or miss. This, however, was and always will be, his biggest hit (in terms of making an ideal film). There are hundreds of quotable lines in here that espouse more philosophy than most filmmakers pack into trilogies. The direction is steady and the acting is great, but what really sets this movie apart is the writing. The writing of Good Will Hunting is so exquisitely realistic and philosophical, that to contemplate your own life during the movie is almost a necessity.

It goes through the horrible abuse Will Hunting faced as a child and how he overcomes it. We also find out late in the film that Sean the therapist also dealt with some abuse as a child. My favorite line is when will starts out by saying ""he used to just set a belt, a stick, and a wrench on the table and say choose"" then Sean says ""I would have to go with the belt"" then will says ""no I used to go with the wrench"" Sean says""why"" will says ""cause f*** him thats why"".

Will seems to have a tough exterior, given the South Boston background, he has a comeback for everything, except he doesn't. The plot further dwells deeper into his attitude towards his relationships with his peers. A mentor, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) is introduced, more like a guardian angel in the form of a Counselor who helps Will get in touch with reality and the trauma that he faced when he was a child which in turn is why he keeps pushing everyone away who's trying to get close to him. He helps Will see the actual picture and pursue the one thing he should follow, his heart. The icing on the cake is his best friend, Chuckie (Ben Affleck), who sees the true potential in his friend and always wants the best for him.

The fight scene on the baseball court was not very realistic, and even though Matt played the character of will being a disturbed and lonely young man very well, I didn't feel like he would be the person who could possibly scare anyone.

He also doesn't know what to do with his ability. Enter Dr Sean Maguire (Robin Williams in his career best role), a therapist that helps Will try to make the most of his abilities. The chemistry between Damon and Williams is electric and plays a big part in making this movie magnificent. Very effective portrayal of a therapist-patient relationship. Besides the two leads, Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver and Stellan Skargard provide great support. Besides their acting, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deserve just as much credit for their Oscar winning screenplay as the story is uplifting.

It works on many levels - the characters and plot are interesting as a well told story, the interactions between Will and the psychiatrist are revealing and compelling, and the questions it raises about life and lifestyle choices are deep and complex. I also really appreciated the relationship between the two friends. The conversation they have while working, when Will's friend tells him about his hope that Will be able to break free of this life, is so real and so beautifully done that I can't think of many film moments that come close. Robin Williams does a great job of creating a character who is flawed, yet incredibly capable of reaching Will and helping him to change his life. To add to the realism, the psychiatrist is also changed for the better because of his interactions with Will. Finally, the photography, attention to detail, and the incredibly good choice of settings and background helps to make this movie believable and great.

As we see the growth of characters, our horizon for our life widens. This film brings a lot of helpful tips for life into my value.

The profanity was not that excessive if you spend any time at all with many lower to middle-class people around the age of the characters.  In fact, it was downright realistic. As for the acting, it was wonderful watching Damon portray this character who has to struggle with what he thinks he wants, what he is told he should want, and what he finally realizes he really wants.  No, I don't think it was the best performance of the year, but it was definitely one of the top five and worthy of a Best Actor nomination.  The chemistry between him and Minnie Driver was electric, particularly during their first date and again in the scene in her apartment before he leaves.  Robin Williams, in my opinion, delivers his best performance.  Sure, it's the typical Williams-drama character from Dead Poets Society and the like, but this character was better with the mental games and interactions with Will.  The best part of this movie was watching the relationship develop between Will and Sean.

After solving a difficult high-level math problem on a chalkboard in the hallways of MIT, his talent is discovered by Professor Lambeau, who decides to help Will reach his full potential. When Will gets in a fight and is arrested for attacking a police officer, Professor Lambeau takes a deal to get leniency for Will if he gets treatment from therapist Sean Maguire. Although the movie plunges into and addresses the emotions of each character, like the psychological trauma that Will experiences, it still manages to incorporate lots of humor. There are many instances where the witty banter and hilarious exchanges, especially between Will and his friends, cause the audience to immediately respond with a laugh.
 ""Good Will Hunting"" was written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who portray the two best friends, Will and Chuckie. One might stipulate that the writing and on-screen connection between the two would be mediocre, considering that Damon and Affleck were just in college when they began writing the script and the fact that they were not the big named actors that they are now. But, because Damon and Affleck are actually childhood besties in really life, they make the friendship between Will and Chuckie (and even with Billy and Morgan) all the more authentic. Their friendship and loyalty towards each other is the glue that keeps the movie together; they accept each other for who they are. The already well established relationship between Damon and Affleck reinforces their performances, reminding the audience that family does not just come in one form. Damon and Affleck didn't just grow up as best friends, they also grew up on Boston, which is where the movie is set. The movie included many scenes that were actually shot in the city. For example, the famous scene where Sean has a heart-to-heart talk with Will at a park was actually shot at Boston Public Garden. The movie has had such an impact on audiences that the bench where the conversation took place became a memorial for Robin Williams after his passing.
 Not only is the bond between Will and Chuckie unmistakable, but also their character development throughout the movie. Usually, the main character in a movie is moving towards a goal and the audience is rooting for them along the way. But, in this film, that is not the case. Will Hunting is not someone who embraces his intellectual gift and, in fact, seems to be against accepting it at all. This sort-of creates a frustration in the audience which, in turn, makes them root for him even more since they want him to learn to embrace it. The movie may seem typical-about some genius kid-but it actually touches upon two very important topics. First off, it addresses the psychology of Will. The movie dives into the psychology of Will and how the psychological traumas from his past have affected him all the way to adulthood. Also, in the movie, Will is faced with a decision: to use his intellectual gift to its full potential, or to pursue love. Just like how Chuckie hopes for Will to be gone one day when he comes to pick him up, the audience wishes for Will to embrace his gift and reach his full potential. But, it isn't that simple for Will and he has to learn to follow his heart and what he thinks is best for him. This screenplay, written by Damon and Affleck was nominated and won an Academy Award, as well as a Golden Globe, for ""Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen"".
 Just by looking at the cast, you can tell that the acting is going to be top-notch. Every role in this movie was cast perfectly and the actors performances were always in-character. The chemistry between Minnie Driver (Skylar) and Matt Damon (Will) is undeniable. Even though Damon wasn't yet a big-named actor, his performance was powerful. Skylar and Will's interactions were effortless, making the audience root for them without the writers needing to keep all the focus on them throughout the movie. No one could play the role of Sean better than Robin Williams. The dialogue that he delivered in the Boston Public Garden became so famous and resonated with so many that, when he passed, the bench where he delivered it became a memorial for him. Robin Williams won an Academy Award for ""Best Actor in a Supporting Role"" for his wonderful performance as Will's therapist/mentor, Sean. The performances were incredibly powerful and believable, and definitely one of the biggest reasons why this movie was so successful and is so loved.
 Despite the frequent use of vulgar language and the predictability of the overarching plot, ""Good Will Hunting"" is still definitely worth a watch. Although the opening minutes of the movie are slow, the movie as a whole presents a refreshingly enjoyable story of a mathematical genius who is, unexpectedly, relatable as he struggles with the psychological trauma from his past as well as the task of finding his true purpose in life.",

589,29 November 1999,svswinger-2,9, One of the best 5 movies of the year.,"The dialogue in this movie is riveting because it gives you a feeling of a chess game of wits and rhetoric, set in modern times. I agree with others who've said that the movie's draw is that basically it's a well-written essay on the extent of the power of the intellect. Will Hunting at first seems like an omniscient god, but the question keeps coming up: so why is he a janitor? The answer is that no matter how much you know, you cannot go anywhere without trusting other people. You can't find love all by yourself; you have to have faith on someone to return it. Will's problem is similar to being rejected by girls over and over again: the hurt/pain tells you it's not worth it and fate will let you down anyway. Anyway Will thinks that by not trying to take his life anywhere, he's playing it safe. The thing is, he's right in that it is the safest, most controllable thing to do. He should see, however, that it is possible for people other than his childhood buddies to love him unconditionally. He refuses to see it, until Sean without asking or warning simply shows love. He didn't ask for it but he got it anyway. That is how you move a genius.",

It deals with a very serious matter and manages to examine its every aspect. It's a fresh and original movie, the kind of those we want to see more in the cinemas.

I point at my husband and yell ""ya suspect - - ya you!!"" at least 5 times a day. I'll never forget Sean's (Robin William's) wise words about not really arriving at a place of true wisdom until you know what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. Until then you're just (wicked) 'smaat' and spouting out facts you've memorized from books you've checked out at the public library. I think it is such a beautiful coming of age story and it stays with, and matures with, the viewer in every season of his/her life.

639,25 March 2019,amirali_karimi,10, I loved it!,"Directed by Gus Van Sant, Good Will Hunting is the story of a mathematical genius named Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon. The film takes place in the campus at MIT, where Hunting works as a janitor. One day after his class is over, mathematics Professor Lambeau writes a problem on the board that took several MIT professors two years to figure out, and challenges his students to solve it. When Hunting sees the problem, he solves it by himself in a matter of minutes. The movie then unravels the genius in him, but also portrays his many weaknesses and his rough childhood. ",

646,9 August 1998,Bomber-2,10, Great pic!,"The film works because it manages to capture various shades of each character in an unforced manner through an intelligent script.Though the impossibility of the scenario depicted may make one apprehensive in the beginning,it is precisely that which allows the cast the unique opportunity to lend credibility to the film's script by their remarkably honest performances complemented by crackling dialogue which ranges from the witty,to the profound,to the meaningfully terse without being overly emphatic at any time.There are many things which have been handled with admirable sensitivity like the bond of friendship between the boys,how the healer(Sean)manages to reach out to Will who in turn makes an impact on him,the refreshing chemistry between Will and Skylar,how prof.Lambeau's personal fears,Will's troubled past and his vulnerability are brought out.Yet for all it's finer nuances,the story is told in such a simple and lucid manner that it holds one's attention even if one refuses to probe into them.I can go on and on about this layered film but i'd rather not because i would like the reader to watch this engaging film speak it's own language himself(or herself)and gather the joys of discovering it's subtleties.",

Oh, by the way, Matt Damon's performance was also 10 times better than Jack Nicholson's....'cmon, anyone can play someone with OCD but not everyone can play someone from Southie and is a genius.

648,4 July 2000,JoePi0105,10, Good Will sure went Hunting to get this excellent movie,"Good Will Hunting is fantastic! A story written by Matt Damon and Ben Afleck which is a little mastermind that leaves you with a large smile at the end, after the emotional roller-coaster throughout. Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a mathematical genius and has potential that only one wishes to have, however there is real personal issues that has affected Will, stopping his own potential to be full-filled because of his life experiences growing up as a child. In more specific terms Will is like a terrified child who stays at home on his couch, so he doesn't have to go into the real world and feel the kind of hurt that has affected him before in life. Will hangs around with so called ""no brainers"" and his best friend Chuckie (Played by Ben Afleck) who is the type that really would lie in the middle of the road for Will we gradually begin to admire this genuine loyal friendship that in the middle class world seems to be rare for some people. Great sub-plot with therapist Sean Maguire (played by Robin Williams) which is like cat and mouse with each meetings they have. Will has always called the shots and kept in control of what he wants people to no and understand about him, but Sean is finally his match, and with great dialogue this kept me locked and fascinated throughout the film as i generally wanted to no more about Will and understand him! There is love in Will's life called Skylar (played by Minne Driver) and Skylar has everything charisma, looks, intelligence and a very sweet/caring side. Will struggles throughout being able to allow himself to love Skylar and become vulnerable for a women once in his life. Good Will hunting is a film that educates and provokes human ignorance for roughly 2 hours and definitely changes people perceptions of judging people who they truly don't understand!",

The cinematography was clean and maintained dramatic tone without unnecessary effects. The actors performances were outstanding Robin Williams is both believable and sympathetic in his role as a good-hearted psychologist with a sensitive past. He earned every inch of that Oscar. Matt Damon also gave a brilliant performance as the damaged genius whose quick comments and fast thinking has the audience laughing when they least expect it.

But if you go out there, living between real people on a daily basis, you realise the qualities of this film. Comparing it with another Hollywood movie, this film is crap. Comparing it with the real life, it is unbelievable true and exciting.

The start of the movie , first, kinda doesn't make any sense.If Will Hunting was so smart, how come it took him until now for someone to spot his jewel. It just doesn't make sense. The plot, however decent and understandable, doesn't seem to segue smoothly. For example, there is a scene where the professor and the therapist are arguing. Then, when Will comes in and they kiss and make up. Where in the hell did that come from? Finally, there is the ending, which is the worst part. It leaves us hanging, with no clues whatsoever as to the outcome of his trip to Cali. I am probably making this film out worse than it actually is. The movie itself is worth a good watch.

This Oscar award winning film so full of emotion you feel as if you are right in the story feeling what Will feels. When Will proves the equation on the board, the momentum begins to pick up. Soon after proving he is a genius, he shows that he is also a brute, and a lover. He can take on hooligans as well as keep a girlfriend. The movie shows how Will and Mr Lambeau begin to connect through their mathematical triumph, but the professors spot in the boys heart quickly fades as he meets a therapist he cannot best. Robin Williams plays Sean Maguire, a run down psychologist working at a community college. He teaches Will many lessons through the pain of his wife's death. He explains how his brain does not allow him to comprehend true emotional responses in situation, he knows them, but does not feel them. The movie is really all about the transformation of this Albert Einstein boy played by Matt Damon from a bum to a functioning member of society. The actors play their roles perfectly and are made for these roles. This movie allows us to see parts of ourselves reflected in Will, and almost brings you to tears when Will breaks down. Flawless movie except for all the cursing to make it R seemed very unnecessary and out of context, otherwise beautiful execution.",

658,30 December 2017,brandongarza-40962,10, Superb Script-Writing and Brilliant Cast Support,I saw this movie 2 years ago so maybe I'm not in the right position to write about it. Truth is I remember a few things about what happened in this film. The story didn't work right for me. I felt like I was watching another film with Robin Williams who was playing the same role over and over again. For another time Williams was playing the good man of the story. Sure he did an excellent performance but its unfortunate that we didn't see this actor play a wide variety of roles before leaving this world for good. Mat Damon is an actor who I can't go along with him in almost any movie he ever played. Same goes with Ben Affleck. Their performances were ok for me but not Oscaw worthy. Same goes with the screenplay. Gus Van Sant did an alright work but nothing out of the ordinary at least for today. I don't know maybe this movie was a success because of it's time but nowadays it seems obsolete. Yes it has good dialogue and some awesome quotes and the ending is leaving you with a bittersweet taste in your mouth but I myself couldn't delve into the film's world. Now you can find a million of movies like this one. I know that it's a movie that inspired almost every other movie of this genre but still I can't consider it a masterpiece. A good movie but nothing out of the ordinary at least for me.,

I had not heard one person say a bad word about this film and they were absolutely right. Damon's character is complex and involving, sometimes even quite humorous. The on screen chemistry between him and Affleck is a joy to watch, Affleck being far less intelligent than Damon's character yet having more common sense and seeing that Will Hunting was just wasting himself is an interesting angle.",

Matt Damon is superb as the fresh-faced, insecure Will Hunting, and displays a striking sense of vulnerability beneath a rough, uncompromising exterior, particularly in the psychiatry scenes...which brings me to Robin Williams. Whilst I have occasionally thought that Williams can tend towards the cloyingly sentimental, his performance here as Will's psychiatrist is truly towering, which was acknowledged by a 'best supporting' Oscar. Peter Sasgaard (think that's how you spell it!) is also worth a mention, with an excellent performance an unlikable, but ultimately well-intentioned professor. Minnie Driver also stars in a nicely portrayed, if somewhat limited role.",

The plot was incredibly predictable, the dialogues were cringeworthy and one cannot avoid to think that this movie is only such a big hype because of the famous/good looking actors.

682,1 May 2023,zahydani,2, Hugely disappointing,"Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deserve a lot of credit for this movie.  One reason they painted such an excellent portrayal of life as it really is or could be, may be attributed to their youth.  Youth facilitated this film with universal themes of the transformation from youth to adult, and to balance the rebelling nature of Will Hunting, Robin Williams adds (with a very well developed character) the humbled but wiser soul of an older man. Even though Will being so naturally gifted at math seems a little out of the ordinary, it is supposed to be this way. The movie takes this abnormality and uses it to make everyone realize how much like Will they are.  Math may not be your strong point or your weak point either, but this characteristic of Will is simply an example of a trait that could cause any type of tension or problems in the life of a person.  I especially love how Williams' character is written into this same theme so that personalities young and old clash. This is one of few movies that can truly move me emotionally every time I see it, and it is because it can be related to every human that ever lived.",

I can tell you why I loved it. First of all the script. I think it had a real slice of life, and brilliance in it. Sorry, but some people do use 4 letter words to express themselves. And no, it doesn't mean that's because they lack intelligence to use anything else. I can rise to the occasion any time I need w/out profanity. But it is how I think & speak in my day to day life. The language shouldn't even be an issue. If that's all you heard, you weren't listening! The brilliance in it is everywhere. For example, William's character putting Damon's character in place by noting that he sneers at things that he has no real life experience with. I know people like that. Then moments when he (William's character) says gems like, ""I'll save you the suspense sport- she isn't perfect & neither are you- the question is whether you are perfect for each other."" I'm paraphrasing of course. The question of relationships, and life career decisions- the courage to risk and overcoming whatever your background is, are all a part of real life. This isn't supposed to be about genius or some ""white trash"" as someone else said (some people might say the kids in this movie aren't trash, just normal hard working, middle class guys) - it's about love, life and courage- courage to ante up & try again, no matter how many times life knocks us around. The acting, direction and script are wonderful. They definitely deserved the Oscar for this. It has soul. It has meaning & I am sad for the people that didn't get it.

Matt Damon and Ben Affleck for writing their wonderful screenplay that consisted of so many beautiful words of knowledge. Gus van Sant for making it possible and my mum for buying it a our local Virgin. So, if you wan't a movie of speech, excitement and emotion, Godd Will Hunting is the best so far.

692,16 October 2020,rcwestpod,10, Stunning,"In a year of the ultimate high budget film, Titanic, Good Will Hunting was at the very least a breath of fresh air.  With it's budget a miniscule fraction of the Oscar winning best picture, Gus Van Sant and the writers, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, produced a picture with much more substance and emotion than any other movie that year. Critics have questioned the reality of this film.  Is it so hard to believe that there is a kid genius from the slums of South Boston?  As far as I'm concerned, the critics must be appalled at the idea that someone without a Harvard education could be so successful and so intelligent.  Get over this fact, and get over this part of the movie.  In all likelihood, the fact that he is a genius isn't the most important element in the film.",
693,11 December 1999,dcc21,10, Great Flick,"It's the first time I've ever write a film review even I feel like I really should starting to do it for such a long time.
I've heard tones of good reviews on this film but I just watched it now, when the pandemic has been on for almost half a year and people have been questioning themselves a lot recently including me. During this hard time I felt confused, lost , angry, disappointed and negative, all these emotions and feelings are the ones that I've never imagined that I would be like when I thought about it.
While I was watching it, I couldn't bear my tears at all from about 40 mins. It reminds me of all those tiny things from the past, failed relationships, people that I've missed and moments that I regret. Your struggled feelings slowly burned up with Will all the way to the climax because you understand exactly how he feels, you understand those hard journeys that make him and you who you are today, but meanwhile, you still want to see and anxious to see him makes the decision that you know what is right.
I'm having a very bittersweet feeling right now and I guess this also explains perfectly why films are so powerful, what a great script, what a character building. I love how Matt used the script shows off a bit side of his English education background with small parts like mentioning about Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens, Skyler as the British girlfriend, all little details were very nicely putted.
I just wanted to say how lucky Will is to have these people around him, his friends, met the Gerry who found his talents and cherished it so much who would do everything to keep it up, and Sean who smartly guides him all the way and also truly understands him, and of course Skyler, a lovely vivid soul with a brave, strong and beautiful heart. All character's personalities are so different and so lively, they're all just like reflections of people around us in the real life, all these lead me to the final question that, did we really cherished our life well enough? If not why don't we just start doing it now? It's never too late.",

I've read the screenplay and seen the movie numerous times, and I can tell you that there has never been a more original film. My love of this film is one of the reasons that I hate Titanic so much. Good Will Hunting deserved all of the Academy Awards that it was nominated for, more even. It was one of the happiest moments of my life when I saw Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Robin Williams accepting their Oscars. No one has ever deserved them more. I feel sorry for Minnie Driver though. She deserved her Oscar much more than Kim Basinger did. Kim was barely in any of L.A. Confidential, while Minnie was one of the most important characters. They all deserve Oscars.",

701,25 September 2014,samanthas-45-119570,10, The best movie I've ever seen,"I was sitting at home one day, and saw an ad for Good Will Hunting on TV. It was a movie that I had wanted to see for years, but never had the time to, so I got up still in my sleep clothes, grabbed my keys, walked outside, got in my car, and drove up to the video store. There was only one copy of it there, I asked the guy why so little, and his reply is,'People just usually steal it.' I thought that was sorta unusual considering that if you were gonna steal a tape from a video store, it'd Clerks, but I still hadn't seen it yet. So, I got home, poured out some nasquick, got some pop tarts, and popped in the tape, and sat down to watch it. During the film, I found myself on the brink of tears. The movie just hit so deep. The janitor that comes off as being some mischievous, beer guzzlin' guy, but is revealed as a brilliant person who has had a troubled past. Being an orphan. Being beaten as a children. Going from foster parent, to foster parent only to find more people that could pummel him. Then, he mets the therapist who can actually connect with him, and not just be another school counselor. This movie is just so emotional, and understandable that it just makes you think about life, and everything it's worth. It displays magnificent writing from Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, and amazing filming from Gus Van Sant. It is definitely a movie that one should rent or buy if they have not already witnessed its greatness.",
702,19 July 2005,shemyrushmoremax,10, Such a relatable and emotional story,"Good Will Hunting is a wonderfully paced, highly engaging drama that focuses on each character with painful emotional authenticity. I mean, literally, painful. The human struggles facing Matt Damon and Robin Williams' characters are so universal and beautifully realized. Every man must face one of their points of view, at some point. The hurt that Robin portrays is touching, sad and moving. You never see his wife. He just reminisces of her and it couldn't have felt more real. The subtleties in Robin's performance in this film are breathtaking as he laughs, cries and has his patience pushed over the edge.",
703,6 May 2015,Wombat_Had_That,9, Wonderful vehicle for every actor involved,"Ben Affleck and Matt Damon wrote and starred in the film, ""Good Will Hunting"" which put them on the map in Hollywood. Matt Damon plays Will Hunting a brilliant young man working as a janitor at MIT in Boston. One day while cleaning he stumbles upon a equation that had been given to graduate students as a challenge. He is able to solve the problem and gains the interest of a professor. Even though Will is brilliant he is from a poor part of the Boston suburbs and has some trouble with the law. After an altercation with a police officer the professor tries to help Will achieve his potential by steering him in the right direction. As part of the deal Will must see a therapist played by Robin Williams. During therapy sessions Will learns about himself and deals with his past. Along the way he falls in love and struggles to determine what is important to him. The acting in this film is superb. Robin Williams won the academy award for best supporting actor. This film also won an Oscar for best writing screenplay. I love this film because it showcases the complexity of life and ones life is made up of choices.",

What you will enjoy the most it'll be the humor, the well-written dialogs, the passion, and even the emotions come off the screen. Only showing what would happen in reality, allowing us to see how others feel and go on in life, while still having some awkward moments and mature language (only us adults understand).

705,26 April 2016,ZoryaM,9, Best Movie Ever Written!,"I was amazed by this film. A story of a young man ,who has a brilliant mind, but finds it easier to use his fists in any situation. I was very engrossed by this film, especially when Damon, the main character and Williams, his psychiatrist have sessions together, discussing Hunting's painful past.The romance between Minnie Driver's character and Matt Damon's is very gentle, which helps the audience to relate t them as characters. The only thing I objected to was the amount of unnecessary use of swearing. Swearing is often used for dramatic impact and effect or to portray the society in which a film is set , but I found the fact that every other word was a swear word quite off putting and useless. Other than that I found the film enjoyable and humorous in just the right places. My favourite part is the scene with Williams and Damon where both men embrace and Damon's emotional barrier is cracked, allowing him to be liberated from his brutal past. Affleck's part is easily as important as Hunting's friend. Such sensitivity. What a beauty!!!!!!!!",

They cater to the lowest common demoninator of people in our live lives not worthy of anything. See this movie and it will enlighten you. Definitely worth watching a second and third time. Highly recommend renting it on DVD. Good premise and storyline. The location was also excellent in Boston. See this film! It is a must-see and deserved all the Oscars.",

This film from the beginning gripped my full attention. It's as if the three stars referenced above really weren't actors in the film. It was real life. No one would be noticed if they tried to redo this film. Life today is very hard, and scenes as depicted here are probably common. Every one in a while it's a good thing to try to convey to the public that we're all alike and from time to time show a glimpse of the extraordinary in their lives, but can't seem to get their message out. Here, Matt Damon, is an example of someone like this. He's fortunate to receive the help he needs. It's not easy, as the film shows, but Robil Williams is the one (that everyone of us needs) who finally breaks thru to truly help someone who is Good, Will Hunting.",

The portrayal of Will Hunting is just so REAL, I am sure that many people are related to his personality and character, and so do I. For those who has a bad past in their life, and became more defensive and always pretending that you are a strong and complete person, please watch this movie.

710,26 November 2005,thedude-52,10, just a great film... every time!,"I first watched this film on DVD after recognizing the title at the local video store. I was pleasantly moved. it is now one of my favorite movies. as i am sure many others were, i was shocked and initially a little doubtful upon hearing that the screenplay was written by Damon and Affleck, and couldn't help thinking that perhaps the latter's input was the occasional pizza run and neck massage for Matt's writers block. i am not a Ben affleck fan and use his name in the credits as a sign to steer clear but he doesn't manage to cripple the subtle magnificence of this picture. will hunting is a gem of a character, complex and heavily guarded, possessing a unique and superior gift and masking it with an arrogant mistrust in anyone but his four drinking buddies. robin Williams gives what i rate as his best cinematic performance as the only outsider to break through will's defenses and have any influence on his actions, using his own experience and surrendering his own covers to eventually gain wills trust and, in a poignant scene, releases will's true emotions and gives him the confidence to let himself do something with his gift. The effect that will has on every person he meets is relentlessly entertaining, whether it be the Harvard business student, the shrinks (and hypnotist), the other mathematicians, the job interviewers or Skylar. His un-rivaled knowledge and accompanying wit shape some hilarious and impressive scenes. when reading through the comments made about GWH i cant help but laugh while feeling sorry for those people giving one star and advising people to ""avoid the hype"". there are even a few people complaining about the language used. uuuuum, do you expect a person of will's background and lifestyle to speak in perfect English, avoiding profanities as to please those around him? the essence of the film is the character of will and his struggle to transcend the injustices of his upbringing. have the people making these comments any knowledge of movie history or prestige? the greatest movies made throughout history are those that step outside the boundaries and portray REALITY or a dramatized or sensationalized version of it. thats the beauty of cinema, we see the poignant moments of life portrayed in new and thought provoking ways. i advise anyone complaining over the language used to watch the likes of ""a clockwork orange""; ""goodfellas"" ;or ""shindlers list"". these are great movies, high up on IMDb's top 250. i am not saying that GWH breaks any new ground in terms of explicit viewing because it doesn't; the language fits appropriately and any attempt to dull it down would ruin the essence of this masterpiece. I wont compare this movie to the heavyweights of cinematic history, because it doesn't need to be, GWH simply is a picture that must be seen, and WILL always be treasured by movie fans, it moves you in a way not many things can in the times we live in. The hype is just. ""ordinary people"" gave a similar message, but Good Will Hunting delivers it in astounding and unforgettable fashion. this movie is what superlatives were invented for.",

These days it seems that a film is either transparently contrived as a money making vehicle, pretentiously aimed at being an art piece or just plain bad! It was nice to see an excellent story done in an above average way! My only regret is that a few scenes were not left on the editing room floor. For example why was the ""don't masturbate in my moms room scene there"". Not because of the subject matter but because A: it wasn't interesting or well done and B: It had no connection with anything else that happened. It could have replaced with another interaction scene between Damon and Driver so that when all the, ""I love you's"" started flying around I wasn't left scratching my head and thinking, already!

714,11 May 2002,wow-2,9, A good editor away from being a masterpiece!,"I vehemently disagree with anonymous from Vancouver, Canada.  Good Will Hunting truly shines in our lackluster times of modern Hollywood movies. Matt Damon reminds me of Pacino of the 70's.  He is a young and a very talented actor that can hypnotize his audience almost at will.  This movie could not have been successful without the supporting cast of Williams and Affleck.  Driver may not be the ""Cameron Diaz"" but she is certainly a talented actress.  The scene at the lake with Robin Williams' ""uncut"" extended performance is just jaw-dropping.  The amount of depth in the character development and the complexities of the plot spun by this movie is just simply amazing and sensational.  This movie is an exclamation point.

But they do because Will and his friends are supposed to be living a tough life and you imagine that they would swear a lot. So because they do swear so much, that proves that Ben and Matt are very good writers and in my opinion they should write more scripts in the future, whether it's together or separate, even though they probably would do better together.

The development of the story grows organically through the characters. Even Skylar, the love interest (played beautifully by Minnie Driver, as too are the rest of the performances great) is an interesting character in her own right and someone we want to follow through the story.

752,26 January 1999,jfriedl,9," A wonderful, moving experience.","Good Will Hunting is a timeless classic, that won countless awards, including an Oscar, a Golden Globe and multiple nominees. This movie relays on the acting and bad boy personality of Matt Damon. Throughout the movie the audience follows the life and what his actions do to others. While this movie was released in the 90's, I still enjoyed and understood the film. The themes and underlying messages also still transfer over to today's day and age. I was thoroughly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. The film captured my attention as I felt many different real emotions, because of the angles/shots, soundtrack and script.
In the opening scene you get a look at how rickety Will's (Matt Damon) life is in the south side of Boston. Along with this you get aerial views and pan shots of Boston to set the scene. I enjoyed the setting because it showed the rich high life society of Cambridge but also the desolate housing and college pubs.
With having it set at MIT is a bit of a cliche, in the sense that of course Will should belong at MIT because of his intelligence. A positive to being set at MIT is that the writers were able to compare Will to the smartest students and professors in the nation.
One of my favorite scenes was the one in which Will met Skylar (Minnie Driver). Will showed off his wicked smarts, and by the end of the night he got her phone number. Matt Damon has a comedic line about apples. By adding this joke I believe it helps to captivate the audience before the movie shifts to being more serious.
Skylar's has some personality quirks. She always seems give the excuse that she needs to study and work hard, on the other hand Matt Damon has the natural talent to read something and memorize it. She believes in Matt and wants him to succeed in life and have a chance. Everyone but Will believes in his potential. With his rough childhood background he has never been rewarded of his accomplishments.
Will has many struggles in his life and doesn't know how to balance his math intelligence with his social life. As a result Will seems to get in trouble continuously but has become a manipulating and is able to get him out of many situations. But on the judges last straw he sends Will to jail, and the only reason he got out was because of the MIT professor. One of the conditions that Will has to agree to though is to go to therapy. After the Professor sends Will to therapy will opens up about his past and his trust issues.
One important theme that I took away from Good Will Hunting was that child abuse and a rough childhood can lead to trust issues. Much like Will's childhood with abuse and multiple homes, Matilda (Mara Wilson) grew up with child abuse and until she was finally able to trust her teacher and create a lasting bond. Another aspect that connects both movies is that both Will and Matilda are brilliant as a result of reading hundreds of books.
It's easy to relate to how heartbroken Robin Williams is with his wife dying. I feel that by put his time into therapy he is able to escape his grief. I really enjoyed his eccentric storytelling of the day he met his wife. This scene added to how Robin Williams was able to balance his grief with remembering the joyous memories.
The shots and angles in this film were also well put together. During most of Will's therapy sessions the director uses eye level and medium shots. By using this effect the director is able to have the audience feel like they are in the room. Along with this the readers are forced to read the facial expressions to get a sense of emotion. During every therapy session but the last both Sean and Will are not in the same shot together. By creating this composition it creates the effect of a real conversation that goes back and forth. Another example of how the director used angles/shots was when he strategically used a high angle shot to show power and dominance. This scene occurred while Will burned the proofs and Professor (Stellan Skarsgard) was on his knees and the camera angle was above him. Will's power over his own life shows true here because of the element of a high shot.
The fight scene is a notable scene because of the sounds and music in the background. The music is very subtle, and there is multiple layers of other peoples voices, but overall the directors were able to edit it together to make it feel like the audience was in the right scene. and finally there is a cop car that skids to a start and arrests Matt Damon. The soundtrack for the remainder of the film is very well thought and adds to either the suspense, happiness of craziness going on in Matt Damon's life.
The script includes dialect that is noticeably a Boston accent. There was the use of wicked which is a famous Boston stereotype. The accents were also very strong on Matt Damon and his Southie friends like Ben Affleck. I think it was a wise decision to cast Matt Damon and Ben Affleck because of their natural Boston accents.
The ending to me was a bit predictable, in scenes earlier you were foreshadowed by what was ahead. Also in most movies there is a happy ending and this movie does just that. The director also left with a bit of a cliffhanger which in today's movies is expected to have the audience create their own ending.
By the end of the movie I felt attached to Will's character and Sean's grief, and the romance between Skylar and Will. Good Will Hunting was a classic movie that will be enjoyed by many in the coming years. I would definitely recommend putting in the time to watch and enjoy Good Will Hunting.",

You can tell right away from the first scene that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are the bestest of friends, and they have several poignant scenes in this movie.

Behind his facade there is something a little deeper about his behavior, something about a childhood that was ruined and about an insecure boy. He is about to go to jail, when a teacher saves him, and makes him go to therapy. This movie is all about a guy who has a hard time trusting people and letting them in, also about why people can be so aggressive sometimes and that it all can be a misunderstanding. I thought this movie was pretty good, because I can relate to Will and because the actors were great. Even tho the movie is about 17 years old it still focuses on important things that can happen to anyone. I thought this movie was good.

Then there are the people calling it unrealistic. Now forgive me but I come from a similar background to the central character Will and I believe myself to be intelligent, but I didn't use my intelligence until very recently. Instead I took to taking drugs and drinking and swearing! Only a few years ago I was working as a cleaner, but now I'm studying programming and media technology at the best technical University in the UK. Now if I can identify with this film's realism (and I live in England) why can't so many others? This film is a veritable jewel. The script is one of the best I've ever seen. The way it mixes thought provoking ideas and witticisms with the kind of colloquial dialogue which we have read in things like 'The Catcher in the Rye'. Now I agree with the sentiment that some people have put across, 'get in touch with your inner Robin Williams'. But thankfully the script or Gus Van Sant or whatever prevented it from going over board. Look at the final scene where they're hugging and saying their farewells. Now this could have overlapped into a typical slushy moment, but no the lines 'Doesn't this contravene the Doctor, patient relationship?' 'Only if you grab my ass' were uttered so as to diffuse it. Then bear in mind that you never actually see the reunion between Skylar and Will! I could go on forever arguing against people's criticisms. But what's the point if certain viewers can't appreciate the subtly evocative direction of Van Sant, the quick fire script and the superb performances by the cast. It's these same viewers who shall, until the end of their days sit and watch the vacuous outpourings of Hollywood mainstream.

Main problem I had with this film is that it tries too hard to lecture us. All these conversations between Will and the psychiatrist are too melodramatic. Because of that, even the good scenes become not as impactfull as they could be. If you showed this movie to a 14 year old they may get a few ""deep"" quotes out of this, but otherwise its a bit too forward. Also, the love story between Will and the girl is under developed. The acting in the fight scene is brilliant, but we didn't see a lot of their connection or chemistry before nor after. And the fact that he desides to go to her in the end is predectible and a bit unrealistic, but i guess the movie has to lead somewhere and show that Will has changed. But the love arc seems to be used for that purpose only and it doesn't feel as organic as the other aspects of the story. Overall, this had some great scenes and some good acting, so if you don't mind the cheesiness it is an intertaining movie with a feel-good ending.",

It wouldn't be long before I would see his similarly styled drama ""Elephant"" about the events leading up to a school shooting.

Despite all of this psychological problems, Will appeared to have a brilliant mind in all fields and not only math. Later in some event in the movie Will sees a guy who he appeared to have some old nursery problems with, Will decided to take revenge, which reflects that his personality is really affected by some memories from the past. He gets arrested and thanks to that he meets the professor who wants to make Will take advantage of his brilliant mind. But to make him do that will had to see a therapist to get rid of his ""aggressive personality"" first. A bunch of therapist failed to communicate with Will due to the fact that he is the one who analyzes their personalities and not the opposite. But prof Gerald knew the one who could communicate with Will and make him reveal what's inside his heart, an old friend called Sean, who later became a close friend of Will's.

You wont see Ben Afleck this good in any other movie, and Robin Williams is outstanding. It is a movie.

Very true to form, and full of real dialogue and overall interaction (that makes you feel you are a fly on the wall). Minnie Driver was a ""knock out"" and her acting was perfect for the role and mood of the film.

But, bearing in mind that such language is endemic to the principal characters in the film, I found myself thoroughly entranced by Will's character development throughout the film.  The script and attendant dialogue carry the viewer along logically, both with respect to Will but also the Robin Williams character.  The development of these two fully-realized characters as their interactions cross provides real insight into the complexities of human nature. The supporting roles of the maths professor and the Minnie Driver characters only add to the painful but honest reality of this film.",

Before seeing it I thought the basic premise was nothing new but Robin Williams might make it an interesting movie. I was delightedly surprised. Matt Damon pulled off a magnificent performance in a not-so-new character type. I found the plot to be a wonderful vehicle for the outstanding dialogue that made the movie so rewatchable for me. The screenplay absolutely deserved the Oscar. Robin Williams had easily one of the best performances of his career (at least as powerful as Dead Poet's Society if not more so). He poured a lot of emotion into a character just as complicated as Damon's. The connection between Williams' character and Damon's was powerful. Minnie Driver delivered a wonderful performance as Damon's love interest. Stellan Skaarsgard, though I don't recall another movie he has been, also played a complicated role as sort of a mental mentor to Damon. But my hat is off to Ben Affleck. This was the first movie I saw him in and his presence on screen was amazing. He is responsible for possibly my favorite scene in the movie, the scene where he tells Will Hunting that he doesn't ""owe it to himself, you owe it to me."" I believe he took the role as best friend to a new level. He also has a wonderful scene where he has to basically just stand there and let us know what is going on in his mind. I hope to see him around a lot in the future. This movie is wonderfully cast and brought me back again and again.",

Go bowling With Professor Lambeau and have a nice conversation about ""exciting math theory."" I think it is definitely believable, hence the word PRODIGY.

801,19 April 2006,diddycream,9, To: Critics,"Good Will Hunting was a good movie, it shows that love can go a long way and in all different ways. Will Hunting double thinks but ends up going with his gut, i thought he should of went with the girl before she left. I see me in Will Hunting i double think but i go and get what i want, people judge Will even though they don't really know him people do that with me too. He has a different way of doing stuff and he's underestimated by others.
People don't think Will Hunting knows what he's talking about or doing because he's younger than them. But Will Hunting actually knows what he's talking about and doing, he's a smart guy. It doesn't better how young you are if you actually know what your talking about don't listen to what people got to say. Age doesn't matter if you know what your talking about. Will Hunting is a person who doesn't care what people say about him he would still go and do anything to help himself.
The only thing i didn't like was the cliffhanger in the end of the movie. I just wanted to see if he really made it to her or even to see if he married this girl. I rate this movie a 7, besides the ending i liked the whole movie. Will Hunting went with what his friends said they told him to go with his dreams without telling them when he's leaving and that's what he did. It was a great movie and i recommend this movie.",

805,14 December 2019,christinebourgeois-73437,9, Williams has it,"Good Will Hunting is an excellent movie. The movie touches upon many aspects of human life. It shows fear, friendship, love, potential, pride, and sorrow along with many other aspects of human life. Good Will Hunting shows real human struggles, and real human triumphs. It has a great deal of genuine humanity for a film.
Good Will Hunting follows a young troubled genius named Will (Matt Damon)who lives in Boston. As the movie starts Will is working as a janitor at MIT. One of the Math professors at MIT writes an incredibly challenging problem on a chalkboard in a hallway and challenges students to solve it. Will solves it after hours and the Professor sees him but Will runs away. Will then hangs out with some friends and gets in a fight. He is going to be sent to jail when the Professor tracks him down, and gives him two conditions to be let out of jail: meet with him for math once a week, and meet with a therapist once a week. Will accepts and this sets the stage for the whole movie. His therapist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) and him continue to meet. Will is reluctant at first but he starts to trust Sean. Will also gets a girlfriend and starts to develop genuine feelings for her.
The movie has excellent characters and dialogue. When two characters talk on screen it feels like a real conversation. The way characters seem so comfortable with each other reminds me of the Oceans movies. The characters have realistic and consistent motives for their actions. The film also uses lots of humor, Will and his friends make fun of each other and the joking feels natural. Some scenes don't advance the plot but it doesn't feel like a waste because watching these characters just interact is captivating. There really aren't any major drawbacks of this movie for me. But it does use a lot of time to set the plot up. The story starts of fairly generic as well. When the movies plot gets going though and the climax is approaching I found myself genuinely glued to the screen. The movie's directing and soundtrack aren't groundbreaking, but they don't need to be for this film and they do their jobs well enough. The actors all do phenomenal jobs. This movie is some of the best acting I've seen from Matt Damon and Robin Williams.
The main strength of this movie is its humanity. It shows many challenges that real people face and it shows these challenges in a real way. The movie shows people dealing with the fear of the unknown and fear of commitment through the main character Will. Will also struggles letting people in and letting people know about his issues. The main struggles at the center of this movie are inherent struggles that come along with being human. Will may be incredibly genius but he's still easy to relate to. The way Will and his friends interact with each other is incredibly natural. Them arguing and joking in the car is incredibly fun to watch. But the best scene that showcases humanity in this movie when Will and Sean are sitting outside on a bench. Will starts cracking some jokes at Sean's expense but then Sean starts talking. Sean tells Will all the things he hasn't experienced yet in life, but the way Sean is doing it is outlining his own life. He's telling Will about the struggles that he's been through. The struggles that come with living a real life. Because the main lesson Sean wants will to learn is to not be afraid to live a real life and put himself out there. The acting in this scene by Robin Williams is immaculate. I've never seen anything done by him that tops this monologue. A Dead Poets Society rivals it.The writing in this scene is just beautiful.
Good Will Hunting is one of the few movies I've seen were the characters seem genuinely real and the movie is still captivating. It has that balance between cinematic moments and real human moments. I was sad when this movie ended because I didn't want to stop watching. I wanted to see more of these characters. The movie was centered around human struggles and human triumphs. This movie is a definite human triumph.",

809,22 July 2006,priam_hasnat_k4,9, Good Will Humping (Damn...Hunting) Is GOOOOD.,This movie was so important in so many ways and it touched me deep inside. It was not overrated at all- hello it came out in the year of Titanic. I think it deserved Best Picture. It also launched the careers of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. (I love both- but Ben is awesome). They are both very talented and deserved all the credit they got. And Robin Williams ends up winning an Oscar with one of his only serious roles. How ironic? He gave the best performance of his career. Although Ben and Matt wrote it and everything- Robin just stole the picture. It wouldn't have been the same without his portrayal of Sean Maguire.,
810,21 April 2001,NewYorkerAtHeart,10, Amazing :),"""Good Will Hunting"" is a film that pulls at the heartstrings of the viewers. Written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, this film focuses on the life of Will Hunting. Will is a troubled young adult trying to find his place in the world. Spending most of his young life in a dead-end job, Will lashes out at the world. After solving a complex math problem, Will is forced into therapy by a mathematician who cant help but be impressed with Wills' natural ability in mathematics.
Forced into therapy, Will lashes out at every therapist to drive them away. This is when we are introduced to Sean who is played by the great Robin Williams. Sean has a unique insight into Wills life. Will in unaware that Sean had the same lifestyle as him growing up. Sean posed a question in the early meetings ""What do you want to do?"" Will is unable to answer this and you can see that it bothers him tremendously. After many months of sessions, will is finally able to trust Sean and he opens up about his problems.
The therapy seems to work both ways in this film. While Sean is trying to help Will he ends up facing his own demons in the process. This was a great way to show growth in both of the characters.
The culmination of this film is when will goes to see Sean to let him know that he is leaving. He notices that Sean is also preparing to leave on his own journey and simply leaves a note for him at his door. The note is sort of an inside joke to them both. The last time we see Sean is here where he says that Will stole his line.
The color used in the movie consists of mostly neutral tones. The office that Sean used had a warm inviting amber color and the camera work was perfect for the scenes they were trying to create. They did an excellent job showing that Will came from nothing and had to struggle to make ends meat. In fact they even go as far to show that he was embarrassed of how he lived and how little he could afford.
Overall, the movie is a great weeknight watch. It draws you in rather quick and allows you to identify with Will and Sean. It hits a cord that people don't always want to face in themselves and makes you ask what do you want to do?",

The movie is absolutely immaculate except for one technical error that Will (Matt Demon) introduces Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck) as his brother to Skylar (Minnie Driver) and she believes the lie. If you have seen the movie fairly attentively(which you are compelled to - its so encapsulating), you must have noticed that when Will first meets skylar in a club, Chuckie is also with him and when Will gets into an argument with the pompous guy (I am not sure what his name is) on history knowledge, Skylar is present right there in the scene. Will says to the guy something like ""You are trying to impress some girls and embarrass my FRIEND"". Now if I was Skylar and I was as brainy as her (she is shown to be quiet a brainy person - at least thats what i feel), I would not have forgotten that Chuckie is Will's friend and would not have fooled by the lie which Will tells her later and introduces Chuckie as his brother.",

When Will's troubled ways land him with a jail sentence, Lambeau reaches out and persuades the judge to release Will on the account that he'd be under Lambeau's supervision and would attend a weekly therapy session. This film, Good Will Hunting, is based on the cliché that a zero can become a hero. There's also a bit of romance thrown in with a girl attending Harvard, played by Minne Driver. This film follows plenty of the movie- industry rules, as well as having an easily anticipated conclusion.

It has a great plot and great script and many turning points throughout the movie. Van Sant used actors that were good to his taste and had many years of experience with acting and were great with their roles: Matt Damon's character was very dramatic and emotional throughout the movie and the hardships he faces. Robin Williams played his role really good that I felt it was just perfect as he explains to Will that deep down in him there is good inside while Ben Affleck and Minnie Drive were great too- both played good in their roles and probably liked Van Sant's way of directing. During a number of scenes it was sort of hard to follow what was happening but as I kept watching I understood how connected the characters were together and the strong chemistry they had.

860,17 October 2020,Neobama,8, Incredible character study,"Gus Van Sant's classic movie, Good Will Hunting, portrays the multi-faceted dynamic of the human soul. Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, is a lowly janitor at MIT. However, his abilities far surpass his position. While cleaning the the math rooms after class hours, Will stops to solve a difficult problem that a professor had posted on his white board. Within minutes the problem is solved and staff and students alike are baffled. Once his genius is realized, the professor aims to mentor and facilitate him in order for Will to reach his full potential. The problem, however, is that Will has created walls that are nearly impossible to break down. These walls prevent him from fully connecting with those in his life, something we see through the actor's guiltless and nonchalant toying with the emotions and authority of others. After getting in a fist fight over an old feud, he is required to see a therapist once a week to stay out of jail.  His therapist Sean Maguire, played by Robin Williams, allows us to see Will's complexity of character. During their sessions, Will's jabs and banter only furthers Sean's desire to break down his barriers. It is Will's physical and verbal defenses to Maguire's gentle probing that show how deeply his problems run. As their sessions progress, the doctor-patient relationship quickly turns into a strong and mutual friendship, and we can see the characters grow and develop through their interactions. Throughout the movie, Damon perfectly plays the wounded genius who has been knocked down one too many times, covering up his hurt with sarcasm and quickly delivered wit. Damon's delivery and mannerisms progress the character... His air of mental superiority and disdain for following authority can easily be seen. The flippant way in which Damon treats others and their emotions helps to bring to light his own character flaws. Similar to Damon, Williams does a wonderful job at showing his character's broken heart and carefully controlled despair. He is haunted by his past, and that is apparent through his acting. In moments where a touchy subject is brought to light, Williams lashes out both physically and verbally. This aggression is contrasted greatly by his usually calm and caring demeanor. Williams makes this switch seamlessly, making his character's pain believable. The script fosters the relationship of the two men, showcasing the benefits that each receives from it. In viewing Good Will Hunting, it is obvious that the scriptwriters know a great deal about the human complexity, brought greatly into play in a scene when Maguire attempts to convince Will that what happened in the past was not his fault. Each character seems to struggle with their sense of self, and we see a general fear of stepping out of the comfort zone. While these issues are covered in the script, the delivery is fast paced and keeps us interested and thoroughly entertained throughout. There are many one-liners sprinkled into heavy conversations to add comic relief, as well as helping the script stay true to the characters themselves. In a world filled with cliché movies that all seem much the same, Good Will Hunting stands out from the masses. It showcases incredible acting and a dynamic script that forces us to reflect upon our own lives. Watching this movie makes one introspectively assess one's own character flaws, much like Will, and inspires one to do something about them.",
861,23 February 2016,lkfricke,8, Good Will Hunting is about a hotheaded genius and his struggle to reach his potential.,What a powerful film. ,
862,26 March 2016,samanthateubner,10, Wonderfully Powerful,"A film following a mathematics genius working as a janitor at M.I.T. sure doesn't sound good on paper but this film beyond defines the never judge a book by its cover statement. Matt Damon portrays a realistic south end Boston, blue collar working man; who is struggling with finding a true purpose in his life; after nearly being jailed for aggravated assault Will is approached by fields medal winner Professor Gerald Lambeau to work on highly difficult Math theory's and go through court mandated therapy in exchange for not going to Jail; as the film goes on Will still struggles with finding purpose in his life but after working with therapist Sean, Will starts finding both meaning and purpose in his life. In my opinion and from my two experiences of watching Good Will Hunting I found that this film touches viewers deeply, and resonates with you even weeks after watching it; furthermore, this film just gets better and better after repeat viewings; great and relatable characters that seem realistic further improve the movie. The films use of low key and high key lighting to show viewers the difference of living standards and locations in the movie is very effective. For example, when the movie uses high key lighting in professor Gerald Lambeau's work place to show that he works in a prominent position at a prestigious university versus the low-key lighting they use in Sean's therapy office to represent his lack of success and greatness compared to Lambeau. In addition to this the movie very effectively uses low key lighting to set the rough around the edges character of both Sean Maguire and Will hunting, this can be seen by how whenever will is in his home or with his friend's low key lighting is used to represent their rough around the edges personalities and lifestyle and the same can be said for Sean. The movie benefits very well from the deliverance of strong character lines and acting that seemed genuine and improved the movie. The use of Boston accents mixed in with a lot of slang really helped the movie establish the characters that were will and his friends and it gave a great point of comparison to professor Gerald Lambeau's more proper and gentlemen like dialect and accent; and Skylar's British dialect helped show her off as more of a preppy rich Harvard type character. I personally found the characterization used in the movie were great. The costumes used also helped in showing the distinct levels of class throughout the movie and was an excellent way to visually represent the difference between will and his friends and Gerald Lambeau and even Skylar. What makes the movie even better is the cinematic and Dramatic aspects used to bring forth a sense of realism and felling to the movie. The use of longs shots to establish settings was very effective and helped established a lot of the movies setting. The use of shot reverse shot and close-ups helped convey the emotion coming forth from the characters especially in therapy sessions between Sean and Will. And the use of hand held shot in the fight at the start of the movie really helped put the viewer in the shoes of the characters that were fighting and gave the viewer a feeling of being in the fight scene alongside the characters. The literary aspects of the film like music ended up being UN-notable but still useful in the scenes they were used. Great casting alongside purposeful and appropriate lines really gave the movie another dimension and made it even better. The use of symbolism throughout the movie gave the viewer very subtle yet effective ways of representing Wills life. The use of the square fence and square objects in Wills house showed the viewer how will was in a way trapped with his current life style; and Will using the square shaped train that is constantly on one set path (like will) to represent Will was an excellent and very subtle way to symbolize Wills life; but the best and most significant piece of symbolism in the movie in my opinion was when Will was given his own car, this represented Will leaving the set path that he was always on when using the train and now was able to do whatever he wanted. The use of a car to represent wills change and freedom to do whatever he wanted was an excellent way to tie up the movie and subtly represent the way Will has changed, due to his therapy with Sean. Despite this movie having a lot going for it still has a predictable plot along with quite a few clichés, although most people won't agree with me but in my opinion the predictable and clichéd plot is not a terrible thing but ends up being one of the best aspects of the movie. The use of clichés like the young troubled adult refusing to get help end up elevating the movie and can give people a way to connect with the main character; and the predictable plot of Will's man vs self-conflict being resolved by the therapy with Sean and everything being all happy afterwards ends up being a nice and satisfying way to tie up the movie. The cliché of the main character always getting the girl in the end was also a very satisfying way to end off the film as it really showed Will's change throughout the movie from being too scared to get out of his comfort zone to literally skydiving out of it by chasing his dream girl all the way to California. The conflict of man versus self and overcoming adversity was resolved nicely due to a predictable, clichéd movie with a very satisfying ending. In conclusion, Good will hunting is a great movie worth watching more than once with very little negatives while also having a lot of positives.",

The type of film that tells me that intelligence doesn't have to look, dress, or act a certain way to be respected. The character of Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, is a highly intelligent albeit troubled young man from Boston. He is staggeringly out of touch with the depths of both his potential and his problems. He is working as a janitor at MIT and solves and equation that Prof. Lambeau challenges his students to solve. In solving this equation and even more getting caught doing so, his genius is discovered. In order to foster this genius Prof. Lambeau leans on a former colleague of his, a psychologist. This psychologist is played Robin Williams and named Sean Maguire. Sean shows Will that struggle and love are a big part of life and he needs to embrace them both to move forward and upward. The theme of this movie can be summed up in human relationships. The many relationships that embellish boyishness and intellect collectively make this movie great. This reminds me of The Shawshank Redemption in the collective of human relationships both inside and out. Andy is troubled by his existence much like Will. The both culminate in a chrysalis type break through. The lighting of both movies is the same. Almost like they didn't do a day of filming without a cloudy sky.

867,15 December 2016,aeonvem,10, An Honest View into the Human Psyche,"It might be thought-provoking for some but it's certainly not a high rank piece of art. I think that acting and editing could be a little bit better (example: when one of the friends (a.k.a. brothers) came to Will's house, we can see as he smiles a little bit and in a different shot, a second later, he's deadly serious on his face). Also, it may give some kind of misinformation about how talent works, being gifted is super helpful but the most important part is practicing. All of the best pianists started at a very young age. There isn't any famous pianist who started at the age of 20 or so and discovered that he/she's a genius (while watching, you could get a thought like there is; maybe only Czajkowski but he's famous due to his creativity in music and not his piano skills). Will was practicing through logical thinking, so that's understandable in his case. However, it was mentioned a few times that he's learning because he's curious but when he was asked to work with the best technology in the world he denied (not everything is in library books) even tho he was fired from the school where he was supposedly taking more advanced materials from. One can justify that by saying 'he was too much bounded with his environment' but it seems to me far-fetched due to the fact that he had to really love mathematics to be that good at it (talent means that you're really passionate about something).",

869,31 January 2017,joey_secrist,10, Absolutely phenomenal.,"As of recently, many films catered towards teenagers are centered around immature humor and high school stereotypes. Unfortunately, most of these movies fail to appear relate-able or funny, very much inside the spectrum of normal to mediocre. The film Good Will Hunting, however, is somehow a more genuine approach at a coming-of-age story, with amazing acting performances and well written scripts. The movie experience is a true joy, and portrays life and maturity in a manner that is touching and heartfelt. Being a mathematical genius, the main character Will Hunting is a disenchanted youth struggling with his identity and pressures of the environment around him. This being a typical movie plot line, it is both revolutionary and surprising in the tactful way it is handled. Although the film ""Good Will Hunting"" centers around an extraordinary genius, the themes of identity, emotional healing, and love successfully imparts a universal message to the quintessential viewer. One of the wonderful aspects of ""Good Will Hunting"" is the portrayal of identity and acceptance in the transition to adulthood. Though Will has an extraordinary capacity for knowledge, his angst and confident attitude only masks the true damage and doubt that lurks. Coping with outside pressures from his mentoring professor, Professor Lambeau, (who is intent on having him enter the modern world as a researcher), Will must search within himself and find out what he actually wants to do with his life. The professor believes that Will should use his intelligence to influence the world around him, but meanwhile, Will is uncertain in the future he would like to lead. A strong-willed, widowed therapist, named Dr. Sean Maguire, portrayed fantastically by the late Robin Williams, helps Will to delve into his own feelings while also becoming a mentor and friend. Through the emotionally trying sessions, Will realizes the true pain and brokenness within himself, and in much thought, decides to follow the girl he loves. Although themes of identity and adulthood may seem common and overdone, ""Good Will Hunting"" presents its case with its poised and genuine approach. The theme of emotional healing and vulnerability is present throughout the entire movie, and handles the topic both uniquely and succinctly. One of the most memorable lines of the movie is by the therapist, who says, ""It is not your fault."" This idea of blame and almost self punishment does not only apply to Will Hunting, a formerly abused child, but also the average person in the world. Even though each situation is different, oftentimes when one is experiencing emotional turmoil, self confidence withers and vulnerability is shied away from. The seemingly impenetrable Will is reduced to tears with these simple words, the scene both shocking and touching. By making key choices in characterization and scripting, the film beautifully portrays barriers being broken down. The movie ultimately teaches that, eventually, hindrances must be faced, and though the situation may seem incredibly bleak, one is able to be good again. Lastly, of course with every coming-of-age film comes the idea of love, both in the platonic and romantic sense. Interestingly, the romance does not feel forced or cliché, and the emphasis seems to be more on brotherly relationships than Will's growing affection for Skyler, a university student. Despite being surrounded with a band of rambunctious and loyal friends, Will still has yet to trust and depend on someone emotionally. By being an accessible, coarse, and vulnerable human being, Dr. Sean Maguire is able to pierce through Will's thick facade, and allows Will to have a mentor to guide him in the world. The movie truly showcases that oftentimes the most important relationships that are made in life are produced out of vulnerability and dependence. ""Good Will Hunting"" depicts beautifully and realistically the extent of a human friendship, and how oftentimes the strange and unwelcome guests in one's life can change it for the better. The movie, ""Good Will Hunting,"" is definitely not a cliché, sappy, teenage film. Instead of playing on stereotypes, it takes a mature outlook on the often frequented themes of identity, emotional healing, and love, and makes it relate-able and touching to a normal audience. In taking a more subversive approach, ""Good Will Hunting,"" is both overarching and personal, which truly makes it a movie for the age, and definitely a film worth watching.",

This changes once he is arrested for starting a fight and forced into mandatory psychology with Sean Maguire (played by Robin Williams). Throughout his therapy sessions, they form a bond and Maguire (predictably) convinces Will to do something with his life. The plot is predictable and cliché, starting with the classic unrealised genius character and ending with his life turning out perfectly. This dull plot development does help create a realistic main character, but Will Hunting is already believable due to his dialogue and portrayal by Matt Damon. However, believability does not create interest. Many of the ""interesting"" aspects of Will are simply generic character archetypes. The orphan. The prodigy. Maguire pulls out the other parts of interest, but simply by stating them, and this should not be the case. Although one might blame it on the fact that Will is a self-guarded orphan and requires therapy for a reason, the film should not be so dependent on archetypes to make the viewers interested. Will's friend (who drives him around), on the other hand, had no cliché background, and viewers learnt about his comradery and down to Earth approach through his honesty while he convinced Will into doing something with his life. The writers clearly had the ability to create interesting characters, so why did they have to rely on archetypes for main characters? Dialogue was spot-on and breathed believability into the characters, which makes it more painful to see such clichéd mains. The symbolism was limited but effective, such as the train symbolising Will's previous one-track path through life, and then him receiving the car for his 21st, which allows him to go places he wants to, symbolising where his math ability can take him. However, these might not be related at all, and the car is simply there as an economically realistic way for Will to follow Skylar to California so the writers can tie up lose ends and finish the film in a positive, albeit predictable, way. The film shines when it comes to cinematography and camera angles, using a range of them effectively, such as the camera panning to a new location when a character enters the room, symbolising a change in tone. The film could improve on setting the scene, as many locations were ill defined. Many scene changes were set by a generic birds eye view of a standard city block, and then transitioned immediately to another scene, without specifying where that particular room was. For example, viewers never saw the building Maguire's psychology office was in, or the outside of the college he was a janitor at. However, that is one of the only areas for improvement. Warm colours are used in places where Will feels happy and safe, such as Maguire's office and Skylar's room. Cold colours are used in places like where he works to convey a sense of hostility. This can be expected from a Hollywood film. Dramatic elements are also used well. High and low angle shots are alternated between during fight and argument scenes to convey a power dynamic, and costumes accurately represent the personalities of the characters, such as Maguire's classic psychologist beard. There's not much to say about the dramatic elements, as they were effectively used. Again, something to be expected from a Hollywood film. This film has all the necessary dramatic and cinematic aspects to be a recommended view, but the clichéd storyline lets it down where it needs it most. Relying on likable but archetypal characters and a predictable heartwarming ending, Good Will Hunting is likable and satisfying, but you don't need to be a psychic to tell how the film will end.",
871,27 April 2017,junkmail-44276,7, Predictable plot lets down an otherwise great film,"I think this film is good because of the exceptional acting, interesting characters, and a great plot. Definitely not my favourite, but still a good film. The film is a drama about a man named Will Hunting (Matt Damon) who is a janitor at a prestigious university and is found out by one of the professors that he is a math genius. He tries to get Will into a prestigious career because of his talents, but Will had a troubled upbringing and is afraid of failing and taking chances in life, and he receives help from a psychologist named Sean McGuire (Robin Williams).

872,30 April 2017,berrydale,7," Pretty good film, but I wouldn't watch it again",Good will hunting is one of the best movies I've seen in awhile.,
873,30 April 2017,derechjacob,9, why good will hunting is something i'd watch again,"Good Will Hunting is a dramatic, life seeking movie that centers around a young adult named Will with a unique gift in academics. Will is a janitor at MIT and his raw intelligence is discovered by a professor at the school after he was discovered to be the person that solved the infamous math equation that no one could solve that was left on the chalkboard in the hall. After getting arrested by police for getting into a fight Will is in danger of facing jail time but the professor at MIT arranges an agreement with the judge to keep an eye on him and make sure he spends mandatory counselling sessions. This was a tactic by the professor to try and groom Will to his full potential but you soon see that Will's problems stem much deeper than behavioral issues. The movie demonstrates Will's struggle to reach his full potential partly because of distractions in his personal life and his self-struggle with adversity and getting out of his comfort zone. At first the conflict is Man vs. Man but later on it turns into Man vs. Self which truly was the real conflict all along. I personally found this film to be very compelling and it quickly grabs your attention. The idea of a naturally gifted individual that has slipped through the cracks and became a janitor at a highly prestigious school and furthermore being able to solve extremely high level math equations after listening too a couple lectures here and there is extremely far-fetched; this is made up for by the genuine acting and the well put together script that captures true emotions and a heart wrenching story. The characters are well put together and there is an extreme character development in the movie. Will goes from a tough, underachieving, rowdy, belligerent boy to a young man with his priorities set straight. This is shown by Will leaving Boston to join his girlfriend Skylar in California as well as him finally opening up to Sean Mcguire (Robin William) who is his councilor. There is also an immense amount of symbolism in this movie. Will's house is surrounded by fences which symbolizes how his potential is trapped and he's not allowing it to go, that is basically the main conflict of the movie. ",
874,30 April 2017,hunter_miles,7, would recommend,"Good Will Hunting is a very dramatic movie that is focused on the life of Will Hunting and his skills in mathematics. Will is a janitor at MIT, MIT is a university near Boston, Massachusetts that is known to be one of the most prestigious universities in the world. Will would do math questions on a chalkboard near a professors class after school hours when nobody was there. The equations could not even be solved by the professor (Lambeau). The professor was stumbled and knew he had to find whoever was capable of solving these challenging equations. After Will gets placed into jail for having another fight, professor Lambeau bails him out under the promise that he will undergo therapy and that he will help him with the challenging questions. Lambeau takes Will to one of his old friends (Sean) for therapy. After several sessions with Sean, Will tries to get his life back in order. Sean gives Will advice on his job and on his love life (Skylar). ",
875,4 May 2017,afeist,8, Decent Movie.,Brilliant in all aspects of the film. Can not fault the portrayal of any character during the film. Each character leaves an impact with the viewer they will remember for a specific reason. The story line is complete and relatable and pertanant to the characters within the story line. I highly recommend this movie.,
876,19 July 2017,Shebie_King,9, Brilliant,"I came here and saw as expected a host of reviews which praised this film to the heavens, as well as the odd few who seemed ignorant to the masterpiece they are watching. One said, ""nothing relatable at all"", and to that person and those who think this, I would advise that if one were to go through life avoiding the chance to understand things that don't apply to them, life shan't be very fulfilling at all. In a heartbroken place I have watched this movie for the first time. The gentleness and realness of the characters in this movie, the delicate yet powerful way in which those who created this masterpiece have portrayed the lives of the young and confused, the old and experienced (and yet still not done in their own confusion), is breathtaking. Many films are created for a reason, some to scare, some to inform, to be funny. This movie was written to have a personal relationship with all who watch it, to provide a strong wisdom to those who form a relationship with it. This is one of few movies that was written to change lives, and it has certainly changed my own. The use of profanity is, unlike many films, part of the realism of the movie. The lead character Will's contrasting intelligence and personality speaks to all of us and highlights the truth about the way we are when we are young, exaggerating them enough that we can see this in ourselves.

877,18 August 2017,emilyweedon,10, A film that changed my life.,"Written by the young minds of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in 1997, Good Will Hunting was a burst of genius that took the country by storm. With over 225 million dollars grossed in the box office, and only a 10 million dollar budget, the film was a massive financial success. Also, with a 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, one of the most trusted movie review websites, the movie's story line and acting were essentially flawless. The movie follows the fictional life of Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, who is a dirt poor 20 year- old unrecognized genius who does not get along with the law. His genius is noticed by a world renowned math professor, Gerald Lambeau, but Will is forced to go to therapy with therapist Sean Maguire in order to study with Mr. Lambeau. The greatness of the film sourced from the constant witty banter, the extreme nature of the relationship between Will and Sean, and the overall lesson of following one's heart.",
878,17 October 2017,Chocopiegod,10, Great Will Hunting,"Good Will Hunting is a beautiful and thoughtful film, which comprises the main aspects of brilliant film making. Director Gus Van Sant has taken the script and plot created by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and created a world in which the film seems real. The film is strikingly naturalistic, which blends well with the fact that Will Hunting is such a genius. The relationships that Will Hunting finds himself in throughout the film are portrayed in honest and fantastic ways, showing the diversity of the character and the way in which he interacts with the people trying to help him in his life.",
879,7 December 2005,matthewbalnaves61,10, Simply Genius Film,"Matt Damon as Will and Ben Affleck as Chuckie fit into my visualization of the stereotypical young adult male from Boston in the 90's. The fact that the two were both raised in Massachusetts makes me smile a little when I realize they are most likely playing a version of themselves from the past but with that said I couldn't have enjoyed this movie more. I assumed far too much about this film just based on the quick synopsis I had read beforehand. Will being the problem child/genius was not quite what I was expecting. Typically these type of characters are written to be a sort of incredibly anti-social recluse, where as Will just received a really bad roll of the dice and grew up with little to no positive guidance and instead used his brilliance to skirt the law and impress his friends.
 The introduction of Robyn Williams' character, Sean, was the perfect addition to balance out Will's reckless nature. Sean's heartfelt approach to therapy is something that should be taken considered by real mental health professionals and Robin William's personality shines through perfectly as a foul-mouthed man that has experienced a world full of struggle and pain. A more exceptional match for a young Will has entered the building, the rest can go home.
This film uses an impressive amount of close-up camera angles as a way to transition through dialogue which acts as a way to keep the viewer engaged and aware of the emotions on the characters faces. This fits perfectly with the emotional impact that Will and Sean's interactions have. What an amazing film, I will be watching this one a second time.",
880,4 February 2018,eternalxv,8, Great spin on the hidden genius premise.,"Good Will Hunting is a story about a young man who is struggling to find himself. Will, Played by Matt Damon was raised in foster homes and finds himself on the wrong side of the law after an assault charge on an officer finds himself working as a janitor per the court orders instead of serving time. Will finds himself sweeping the hallways of MIT where he sees mathematical equations scribbled on a dry erase board for one of the classes. Will, solves the problem with ease and is recognized by Professor Lambeau played by Stellan Skarsgard. Will is then sent on a roller coaster ride of finding love, trusting his therapist Sean, played by Robin Williams, and not leaving his friends behind who have been the only loyal people in his life. 
The theme of this movie is trying to find yourself. Will was raised by the state and was in foster homes most of his life. He lived a hard life and never played by the rules, in fact, Will usually made his own rules. Wills friends were the only sense of family he ever had so trusting others, especially adults, was not going to happen. Will finds himself in trouble with the law after an assault on an officer earns him a deferred prosecution becomes a janitor at MIT. Will comes across as just a product of his environment and nobody could predict the genius that was hiding behind his thick walls. Will becomes a client of a therapist that little beknown to him came from a very similar background. Sean, played by Robin Williams, digs deep to the inner core of Will trying to help him find the true person he was meant to be. Sean is there for Will and teaches him that not everyone he encounters has a set motive. Sean spends a lot of time during their therapy sessions talking about his own life to try to gain the trust of Will. All Will has ever known was this town and his friends that he grew up with. When a girl named Skylar comes into his life he initially pushes her away and breaks up with her before she can hurt him.
Nobody expects Will to be so smart based on his upbringing. Professor Lambeau even stated that Will just ""got lucky"" solving his math problem. There is a special bond that is built between Will and Sean and he finally starts to let his guards down when they are comparing the beatings that they used to take from the hands of their fathers.
In the end the biggest scene that gets stuck in my head was Will and Sean's last session when Will overhears Sean arguing with Professor Lambeau regarding Will's future. I think this is the first time Will has ever experienced somebody sticking up for him. Will enters the room and it is just him and Sean and Sean tells him, ""it's not your fault"". At first Will is a little skeptical but Sean keeps repeating it until the final wall that Will has built breaks and he breaks down in Sean's arms. Will then decides to take the biggest risk he has ever taken, leave the only town he has ever known and all of his friends to ""go see about a girl"". 
Another movie that compares to Good Will Hunting in my eyes would be Stand By Me. This movie was produced in 1986 directed by Rob Reiner but follows the theme of finding yourself. This one is not just one boy trying to find himself but 4 boys that grew up as friends but had 4 completely different backgrounds that had to overcome obstacles of bullies and just being treated differently by others.",
881,1 February 2018,lyndecreviston,10, Very inspirational movie,"This movie is wonderful just because it is all genuine human emotion. How it is natural for anyone, no matter how bright they are, to not want to experience life because of their own field of experience. How we can cripple ourselves with our own sadness. We see Will Hunting who has this amazing gift for mathematics, yet he does not use it. I think it is very poignant to show how on the surface, it appears that will does not use his gifts, or try to accomplish anything outside of being a janitor because he is stubborn. When the movie progresses, we see that he is not stubborn, just in a great deal of pain. The movie as a whole is great because of the chemistry between Damon and Williams. Being a psychologist, Sean Maguire(Williams)is supposed to unravel the enigma that is Will Hunting(Damon). To find out why someone with such exceptional abilities is constantly in jail. Sean attempts to guide Will. He does not show much companionship towards Will early on. Sean would not allow Will to toy with him as he toyed with numerous other psychologists. What I love about this movie the most is the fact that Sean was only able to reach Will and help him, is because Will first reached him, and helped him. Sean was still grieving over the death of his wife. Grief that was preventing Sean teaching at MIT instead of teaching at a community college. Will encouraged him to move on. Will was grieving over the painful experiences of his childhood. Sean encouraged him by making him realize ""It's not your fault."" One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Any film and any actor that can truly portray vulnerability, pain, and the will to do what is best for you, is a great film in my book.",
