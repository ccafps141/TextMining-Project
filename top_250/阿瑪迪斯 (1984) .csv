0,16 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, One of those movies that you'll never forget,"I remember as a child, my sister told me to watch this film. That it was the best film she ever saw. I didn't watch it until I turned 10; finally I sat myself down and watched it. I fell in love with it.",/
1,3 September 2010,JamesHitchcock,10, The Patron Saint of Mediocrities,"Most films about composers- Ken Russell's ""The Music Lovers"" about Tchaikovsky and ""Immortal Beloved"" about Beethoven are examples- rely upon the cliché of the creative artist as tortured, neurotic genius. Perhaps we like to console ourselves for the fact that we are not ourselves geniuses with the thought that genius must be paid for in mental suffering. Of course, not all composers fit this stereotype- Haydn was stoical in the face of misfortune (including a miserably unhappy marriage), Rossini was a noted bon viveur and it was often said of Felix Mendelssohn that his forename (Latin for ""happy"") well suited his character. But when did you last see a biopic of Haydn, Rossini or Mendelssohn? ""Song of Norway"" told the story of Grieg, another composer who doesn't really fit the ""tormented genius"" label, but it bombed at the box-office. ",r
2,26 November 2006,possumopossum,9, The Movie That Made Me Appreciate Mozart,"Before I saw this movie, I respected Mozart's genius, but his music wasn't my cup of tea. Beethoven was more to my taste, I tended more toward heavier classics. But this movie moved me to tears, especially at the end when they did Mozart's REQUIEM while he was working on what was to be his last piece of music. Now, I'm a Mozart fiend. This was a great movie. True, there are some historical inaccuracies. Anyone who has studied music history knows that Sallieri did not help Mozart with his Requiem. It was a student of his named Sussmayer. But it does make this story ironic, that the man who was so dedicated to the ruination of Mozart ended up helping him in the end. (I question the historical accuracy of that as well.) I recently bought the director's cut to this movie. Until I saw the director's cut, Sallieri seemed like a more sympathetic character, someone who just couldn't buy a break. Who can't identify with that? But after seeing the director's cut and seeing what I think is an important scene between Sallieri and Mozart's wife, he seemed more like a jerk. You also understand why Frau Mozart was so rude to Sallieri at the end of the movie, whereas before, you see the next to the last scene and you think, ""Whoa! Where did this come from?"" This was a great movie, for entertainment value only. If you want historical accuracy, watch a documentary or read a biography from the library or something. Because of this movie, I am now a rabid Mozart fan. If the movie can make Mozart converts, then it can't be bad at all.",e
3,7 March 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Absolutely brilliant!- funny, charming and touching, a masterpiece!","I adore classical music, and Mozart is one of my favourite composers. When I came across Amadeus in my local charity shop, I knew I had to buy it. I watched it, and I loved it from start to finish. It is true it is not necessarily a true depiction of Mozart's life, but I was so blown away by the quality of the acting, sets, costumes and music that I forgot about that. The film is just gorgeous to look at, Vienna in the film (Prague in real life) looks beautiful, but the sets and costumes are colourful and lavish. The music is utterly majestic, from the Marriage of Figaro, Queen of the Night(brilliantly sung in what is one of the most difficult colouratura arias ever), Requiem in D minor to Don Giovanni, it was a feast to the ears. The script I thought was of exceptional quality particularly during the finale of Marriage of Figaro(one of the most beautiful tender moments in any opera is where the countess forgives her husband), and the direction was very fine. As many reviewers have pointed out, this is more about the mediocrity and envy of Salieri than it is of the eccentric genius of Mozart, thus the story was compelling and intriguing. The acting is wonderful; Tom Hulce is excellent as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, yeah his laugh is a tad grating, but I loved the manic and eccentric interpretation Hulce gave. Elizabeth Berridge is suitably petite and alluring as wife Constanze while Jeffrey Jones is delightful as Emperor Joseph II. For me though, F Murray Abraham gave the film's best performance, for he was absolutely outstanding as Salieri. Overall, brilliant film, gorgeous to watch, amazing music and essentially a must see! 10/10 Bethany Cox",v
4,30 January 2007,miknnik,10, True Gem for Movie and Music Fans,"I'd like to point out a few facts before I review the movie. First of all, Mozart died at home surrounded by his family, pupil and a priest. Secondly, the plot of Amadeus is not exactly original. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote a short opera called ""Mozart and Salieri"" with the bare bones of the story and the identical characterization of the two composers, and he used Pushkin's drama for the libretto. So, the rumor that Salieri killed Mozart has been around for almost a couple of centuries though we all know there isn't an iota of veracity in it.",i
5,16 January 2010,AlsExGal,9, To give everything you have to music and come up short,"At the tender age of 26, when I still thought no film was complete without a car chase and a big explosion, Amadeus had me hooked. I went to see it multiple times back in 1984 during its initial release, back when the theater was empty whenever it played and before it was nominated by the Academy.",e
6,6 December 2014,SnoopyStyle,9, Great F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce's laugh,"The movie opens with an elderly Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) confessing to killing Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). He used to be one of the great composers of Europe but has since been forgotten. As a boy, he was jealous of Mozart. He was delighted that his boorish father died. He works his way up to being the court composer to Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones) in Vienna. He is eager to meet Mozart but finds a flamboyant immature sex-fiend. Soon his admiration turns into jealousy of Mozart's Godly gift. Mozart marries Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge).",w
7,20 August 2016,ironhorse_iv,9, Rock me Amadeus! Amadeus is a beautiful musical masterpiece,"Extraordinary! On the page it looked nothing! The beginning simple, almost comic. Just a pulse. And then, suddenly, high above it, beautiful music. A single note, hanging there, unwavering. Until a clarinet took it over, sweetened it into a phrase of such delight! This was no composition by a performing monkey! This was a music I had never heard. Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing. It seemed to me that I was hearing the voice of God. Director Milos Forman's Best Picture winning drama was indeed a masterpiece. Based on Peter Shaffer's extravagant 1980 Broadway play with the same name. The film tells a fictionalized biography of tortured genius and Viennese child prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). Also, the story was presented in a way that was very unique at the time. It was through the eyes of fellow jealous composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) who finds the deeply crude and childish behavior of Mozart, unworthy of such praise. Driven by his attempt to outshine Mozart, Salieri must find a way to gain the audience of the Austrian Aristocrats, before it's too late. Without spoiling the movie, too much, a lot of people had complain that this movie wasn't historical accuracy. In my opinion, a lot of this criticize wasn't needed. To the film credit, Amadeus never claims to be a true story. It's normal for films like this, to sometimes diverge from historical facts in order to explore more fundamental and universal human issues and to achieve a dramatic effect. Yet, the film had more fact than fiction than most people are willing to taken. It did a lot of homework to get, as accuracy as possible. So, when I hear, some of the main complains that the critics point out about the film. I had to question, their short-temper justice. I felt like they were misinform. Many of the so-call historical inaccuracies were somewhat true. It's true that Antonio Salieri later claims he killed Mozart. Even Mozart toward the end of his life, swears that he's believe that he been poison, but in terms of Salieri doing it; its indeed historical fiction; due to the fact that most historians dismissed his mad ravings with that of a person whom clearly had his sanity deteriorated & the fact that Mozart fell ill while in Prague on Sept 6. 1791 where Salieri was clearly not there. Another claim, these critics spoke of, is how the film, portray a masked man wanting to commissioned a requiem from him in order to steal his work. In truth, it was very likely at the time for people to anonymously commissioned requiems from famous composers and pass them as them, off; but there was no reason why Salieri needed to. After all, his music was a lot more popular at the time, than Mozart. It wasn't, because Mozart was lazy. It was, because he was a fading child star, who had drug problems which both historians and film critics fail to notice that kept him working. I thought that Tom Hulce's immature performance as Mozart was very accuracy as it was very well documented that the composer had those characteristic traits even if it's a little exaggerated. However, the ever-present, idiotic giggle does get a little too annoying at times. About the fact that Salieri and Mozart were fighting for certain imperial jobs, it was true, but the reason why Mozart was never given a position on the emperor's courts, wasn't, because Salieri's envy of Mozart, but the fact, that Mozart's music doesn't sound typical 'Galant' & he wasn't noble. There was no reason why Salieri really needed to steal his work, as he was rich enough, and Mozart's work was a little too controversial at the time for basing works on Austrian's past banned materials and not being tradition. About Mozart's constant embarrassment of Salieri, such as seducing Salieri's lover, Catarina Cavalieri (Christine Ebersole). There is no evidence that Mozart slept with her. In reality, it is very likely that Salieri slept with Catarina, as it was generally known, at the time, that she was his mistress, and if they were still together years after 'The Abduction from the Seraglio'. If anything, Mozart and Salieri were, if not best of friends, at least on peaceable terms with one another, when it comes to sexual and musical conquest. He wasn't a saint at all. He even educated Mozart's younger son Franz Xaver Mozart, after the composer death. While, yes it's true that Mozart's work outlive, Salieri. It wasn't because Mozart work was better than Salieri. It was, because German nationalism began to take shape in Vienna with the birth of Romantic nationalism during the Napoleonic Wars. Italians were often view, as scapegoat of the war since Napoleon was one; thus Italian culture like it's music was somewhat banned from most European cultures during the mid19th century. This short ban, cause hits like Salieri to be nearly forgotten. It wasn't until, the late 20th century that most of Salieri's work was reintroduce into western culture with this film. The film was well-received by both critics and audiences alike with its lavish set and period costume design, music, visuals, and its acting. If the film had any faults, it would be the fact that the movie has pacing problems. It's way too damn long. 2h 40min is too much. It could had been cut down. Ultimately, the 1984 awards were monopolized by Amadeus with eight wins: Best Picture, Best Actor (F. Murray Abraham), Best Director, Best Screenplay Adaptation, Best Art/Set Direction, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, and Best Makeup. It became the 7th film in Oscar history to win eight Oscars. Overall: It's visually interesting, has dramatic intrigue acting from F. Murray Abraham, hilarious comedy, and introduced people to a part of history that was phenomenally fascinating and surprising, mostly true. I highly recommended this film.",/
8,27 September 2004,OriginalMovieBuff21,10, An Excellent film of describing Mozart's life from wealthy with great fame that shatters in pieces,"Amadeus is one tremendous film. The acting was great. Tom Hulce did wonderful and I have only seen him once in a film and that was Animal House. The rest of the cast was great to like F. Murry Abraham did a terrific job in his performance. The music was brilliant, I have never seen a film with such great performances in their plays. I really did admire this movie, everything in it was very interesting and after I watched the film I did a little research on Mozart. The script and directing was superb and the cinematography was brilliant. I couldn't of asked for a better film than Amadeus. I'm glad I saw this film!",r
9,23 January 2004,dr_foreman,10, my number one,"Now, this is my idea of a movie - spectacle, religion, sex, envy, and some of the most stirring music ever composed.  And it all seems so modern; a bad visit from Mozart's father is awkward in the same way as a bad visit with my own parents!  Here's a film that makes ancient history seem like yesterday, using the same trick employed by all classic films - solid characterization.",w
10,16 February 2005,sol-,10, My brief review of the film,"A lavish, highly enjoyable production, the film is one of the finest biopics ever made, not just because of excellent production values, or the mystery element about the title person's death, but because it brings more to the depicted section of Mozart's life than just that. The film brings up and dives into deep religious issues and how important such religious beliefs were in the eighteenth century, and also it brings up some ideas about the profane mixed with the sacred. The whole production is wonderfully set to classical music, and it is technically superb in every area, with very good costumes and editing, as well as some fine acting, particularly from by Jeffrey Jones, who is as delightful as ever as Emperor Joseph. Nevertheless the film feels a bit lively in excess at times, and it never quite feels like it is in Vienna with the mixed accents, but still it is a quite a stunning achievement and simply superb entertainment. The film deservedly won 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture. A director's cut of the film was released too, running an extra twenty minutes at no detriment to the film.",4

14,8 February 2001,Quinoa1984,9," Excellent in the director's cut, though still long.","Amadeus actually caught my attention, in parts. It has excellent performances from F. Murray Abraham as a semi-famous musician who is incredibly jealous yet fascinated with the prodigy Amadeus, played to utter perfection by Thomas Hulce (love that laugh). The theme of competition is one that director Milos Forman latches onto and gets enough juice and dramatic tension to pull off the epic nature of the film, both personal and extreme. Often quite good, however suffers from the overlong-ness and sometimes it is impossible to keep attention, however it snaps back every once in a while. Period detail and is to the dot. And the music makes up anything else I could want in a film. A-",7

16,24 February 2011,vincentlynch-moonoi,8," Solid biopic or film masterpiece, depending on your perspective","There's no denying that this 1984 biopic, directed by Milo Forman and written by Peter Shaffer, is a great film. It's a story about the old adage -- life is unfair. In fact, just to demonstrate how unfair, it probably should have been entitled ""Salieri"", rather than ""Amadeus"", because its really the story of Salieri and his bitterness over the success of his contemporary. But, the average person is somewhat familiar with Mozart, so let's be commercial about entitling the film.",9
17,15 March 2005,SevenOfNine63,10, Genius,"It is because of this movie that I began listening to Classical music. Up to the age of 20 I wouldn't listen to anything but rock, rap, hip hop, punk. Then I fell in love with Mozart. And because of this epiphany I went on to listen to other styles of music such as country (Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Hank Williams), Edith Piaf, Al Jolson, and so on. This movie is breathtaking. A knockout and I wish I could see it on the big screen! Tom Hulce was wonderful as Mozart! Elizabeth Berridge who plays his wife Constanza looks eerily like the real Constanza judging from portraits of the great composer's wife. ",/

19,23 May 2004,mario_filipe,10," A movie of a genius, directed by another one !","I thought that it would be impossible to make a movie like this one! Peter Schaffer's original play inspired Milos Forman, the great czech film maker, that surprised the world with ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" (1975). The sublime, almost over-human performance by Frank Murray Abraham (the Mozart enemy and secret admirer, Salieri) is one of the keys for the movie success, mostly to it's depth. The perfect sense of timing by Milos Forman is admirable, he knows when to play wich music. All the scenarios: opera houses, palaces, streets, etc., are details absolutely harmonious! One of this classic secret was that Forman gathered ""the"" team, perfect team work.",r
20,26 December 2005,mstomaso,9, Landmark historical speculation,"Amadeus presents a heavily fictionalized, speculative portrayal of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's last years, focusing powerfully on his relationship with Italian composer Anthony Saliere, and Mozart's wife, Constanzia. My review is based on first seeing the theatrical release in the theater during its first run, and then viewing the director's cut twice. In my opinion, the director's cut is a much better film, though the theatrical release would still earn an 8 from me. ",e

Beautiful Cinematography and stellar performances by all especially F. Murray Abraham who carries the film. Tom Hulce was a terrific choice for this movie.  True this is historically incorrect but it doesn't matter this film works on so many different levels... the music ahhh the music.

I know that ""Amadeus"" the movie is not exactly his biography, and his relationship with Antonio Salieri, with his father Leopold, with his wife Constanze Weber, with the Emperor Joseph II and with the court musicians in Vienna of 18th century, might not have been exactly like it was shown in the movie, and Mozart himself might not have laughed as Hulce did but I LOVE the movie. I've seen it many times and I still love it. It is about a conflict between a genius for whom to create was as easy as to breath, and a talent that realized that no matter how he tried, he can not be a genius. It is very easy to admire a genius from the distance; it is unbearable to be next to him and to realize that you never will reach the same heights.

27,11 March 2012,planktonrules,7, Grrr...the history teacher within cannot allow me to completely enjoy this film.,"Sometimes, it's hard to be a retired history teacher. After all, when I see many historical films, I see the errors in the script--where the writers take HUGE liberties with facts. As a result, you would NOT want to go to certain movies (such as ""Pocahontas"") with me, as I invariably complain about the crappy writing and lack of historical accuracy. While ""Amadeus"" is a gorgeous film to watch, it is also a film you would probably not want to watch with me! While vaguely following the events of the adult Mozart's life, so much of the film is wrong--terribly, terribly wrong. And, in the process, the film does a terrible disservice to the memories of the folks portrayed in the film. To me, history is like a holy book--you don't just change it to meet your needs--but here in ""Amadeus"", facts just aren't particularly important. In the film, Antonio Salieri is a bitter, nasty no-talent. It's easy to urinate on his memory today--it's not like he has family members who will defend him after 200 years! And even worse is the portrayal of Mozart who is shown to be a two-dimensional man. On one hand, he's a musical genius. On the other, he's a blithering idiot whose laugh makes your skin crawl--and there's absolutely no evidence that this aspect of the character is the least bit like the real Mozart.",u
28,13 December 2013,bandw,6, The casting of Hulce was a problem for me.,"I am sure that casting Tom Hulce as Mozart was a great risk, but unfortunately that was the main thing that kept me from enjoying this movie. It wasn't all Hulce's fault, since there was a decision to have him insert an exceedingly irritating cackle at pretty much random points. Whoever dreamed that up must have really liked the idea, since there is one final cackle that closes the movie after all of the end credits have run. Hulce's attempts to act as an orchestra conductor were on a par with what you would expect from some untutored middle school student, what with gesticulations that mainly just kept the beat. ",r

31,17 February 2010,dataconflossmoor-1,10, A Genius? A Diamond In The Rough? Who? Mozart? Or This Movie's Director?,"What can you say about this movie's director, Milos Foreman? He is just simply superb at the itemization of complex human nature. The film, ""Amadeus"" is considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time! You would think that any director who lays claim to a film with such a stellar reputation would be at the pinnacle of his professional genius. The fact is, that in Foreman's case, he previously directed another film which has been critically earmarked as perhaps the most spectacular movie ever produced, that motion picture being: ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" Milos Foreman won the academy award for best director in '1975 for ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", just as he won the academy award for best director in '1984 for ""Amadeus"". Foreman takes a monotonously challenging approach to his films. I am convinced that this world renowned director could build a perfectly designed New York City skyscraper using only a pair of tweezers. This is how detailed Milos Foreman actually is! ""Amadeus"" was a simply remarkable movie which engages in a comprehensive biography of one of the most masterful composers of classical music in the whole history of all creation, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. This movie depicts how Mozart did not even write the notes to his sheet music on script paper, he memorized all of the music which he originated !! That is just simply amazing! Clinically using the adjective, prodigal, for describing Mozart, would merely be a paramount utterance of understatement. The culprit to Mozart's vulgarity was due largely in part to his baroque environment! Mozart's corrupt candor cultivated a tailor made invitation for his spontaneity to allow his personality to open the floodgates for him to maximize his flourishing aggregate potential! The movie ""Amadeus"" purported an intensely vivid clarity for pointing out a great many of Mozart's talented attributes! In a time when Germanic culture carried an assertively chauvinistic aura with the world's paradigm, Mozart was convinced that if he was going to write an unequivocally marvelous opera, that this opera should be composed and expedited in Italian. The English translation for this opera was entitled ""The Marriage of Figaro"". The cerebral complexities to Mozart were simply astounding. The grass root recognition of ideological fervor which prevailed with the hierarchy during the period of nineteenth century Austria was portrayed with a very subtle disposition in this film! The rendition of Mozart's music which was performed by the Dallas symphony, and conducted by Edward Mata, was a compendium of Mozart concertos which I will emphatically categorize as marvelously top notch entertainment. When I was in Austria, while visiting Salzburg, I ate lunch at a restaurant which use to be Mozart's home. The plethora of Mozart artifacts in Salzburg were, to say the least, intellectually sensitizing! This enriching sojourn of mine became a reflective synopsis of how influential Mozart was to the entire spectrum of classical music. As a matter of fact, I became passionately imbued with an aesthetic appreciation for Mozart as a result of watching this film,!! Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart auspiciously revolutionized all of western civilization.The film ""Amadeus"" executes a successfully cogent expertise at illustrating Mozart as an aficionado with an artistic finesse and an unprecedented musical flair!! Winning the academy award for best picture back in 1984, this is just simply the introductory tip of the iceberg in terms of being an indicator of how wonderful this motion picture truly is. If you have not seen ""Amadeus"" yet, make it a point to do so. The acting is great, the cinematography is enlightening, and the directing, by one of the all time directors in the whole history of Hollywood film making, Milos Foreman, is totally sensational!! See this film!! Five Stars!! Perfect Ten!! No Question About It!!",
32,2 April 2011,ave27,9, A well-done and memorable piece of work,"Not only did I enjoy watching this movie, but it also stuck with me afterward. In most respects it is well put together. The story if multidimensional and carries the viewer along well. The acting is superb; F. Murray Abraham as Salieri is flawless, Tom Hulce gives a fleshed-out portrait of Mozart's brilliance and his (according to the film) frivolous personality, and Elizabeth Berridge and the other principal actors put in solid performances too. The music works well with the scenes; my only complaint is that some of the opera scenes get a bit long. However, all in all this is an excellent piece of work.

37,22 November 2015,sharky_55,10, It is miraculous.,"Amadeus, or Loved by God. We view this figure through the historical lens of an ageing and seemingly senile Antonio Salieri, but I am struck by how clearly his memory haunts him, however accurate his representation of Mozart may be. In reality, Mozart was not some genius whose notes came to him as easy as breathing did, but that is how Salieri remembers it. We see how beautifully his recount flows in the editing; how these L cuts create such magnificent sound-bridges which link each period of Salieri's fall and Mozart's rise like a symphony. A crumpled letter from the angry Leopold transitions into the sound scattering a flock of deer as the Emperor proposes his niece as a pupil. Caterina Cavalieri is one minute a student of Salieri, the next inexplicably the star of Mozart's Seraglio, another cruel blow. And in the most evocative scene of them all, where a disbelieving Salieri inspects Mozart's original works, and each turn of the page unveils another masterpiece, and both Salieri's are trapped in ecstasy. F. Murray Abraham's dual roles are masterful; in one he is silent, so caught up in the majesty of these ink-strokes on the page as he trembles, and in the elderly voice-over, recalling the discovery crystal clear, and we know how wrapped up he still is after all these years in conflict, in admiration, in respect, in bitterness and unbearable envy at being passed over by God. See the contempt as the father hums along to the recognisable strings of Mozart's Serenade No. 13. I must admit I too can only recognise one of the three, and so there is a little bit of truth in this dramatisation. ",

Brilliantly paced the film runs for 180 minutes (Director's Cut version) and is full of detail (you'll never see a film film so exquisitely ornate with fantastical costumes and production design - it's like a baroque twist between Stanley Kubrick's 1975 'Barry Lyndon' and a wildly imaginative ""anything goes"" style), dizzying narrative depths and extravagant cinematic power. The character studies of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) and Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) makes both for career-defining performances, the spiraling relationship between them makes for a dynamic pace that keeps upping the drama towards the powerfully dramatic climax. The music of Mozart feels like the final third main character, so beautifully edited to the masterfully shot scenes by Miroslav Ondricek (the elegant gliding through the corridors, the flaring candle-lights, the crane-shots in the opera... it's truly the finest piece of cinematography ever), the film will reveal new artistic elements ""simply"" in its grand beauty. Importantly, the film is not about Mozart, it's about Salieri and his Mozart and his God, and through several viewings it reveals new sides in the tales of greed, guilt and faith, and it's psychological and darkly painted drama simply enhances more and more as years go by.",

Combining exotic and fascinating sets with great cinematography, flawless acting, grand writing, great directing, and a well-picked soundtrack to blend it all together, Amadeus is a visual treat full of deep themes that will move and question your soul.

Sorry, you classicial music luvvies, but Wolfgang Amadeus - or should I say 'Wolfie' - does not belong to you, he belongs to the world, and he was of such an ilk of genius that the world cannot define him in any prosaic way, but if he is best remembered by many as the characature presented here, that is no bad thing and in fact leads to a greater understanding of his achievements.

For starters, the two leading actors played by Oscar and Golden Globe Winner F. Murray Abraham and Oscar Nominee Tom Hulce play Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, two rival composers. When Abraham speaks, you can't take your eyes off him whether he is elderly or young and promising and gifted as well. He saves his envy for the spoiled musical prodigy Mozart who is also goofy and childish as well. It's Salieri who begins to despise his rival without telling him the truth of how much he resented Mozart's musical genius and that God chose Mozart over Salieri. Anyway, the backdrop which includes the lavish costumes and art direction are unforgettable. The movie takes you to another place and time where the same occurrences of rivalries, jealousies, and envy can be a powerful weapon of hatred. Mozart naively believes in Salieri's friendship and support. I don't care for the casting of American actors like Jeffrey Jones playing the Austrian emperor. Cynthia Nixon playing the maid hired by Salieri to spy on the Mozart family. I thought Elizabeth Berridge was adequate as well as Christine Ebersole. British actors like Roy Dotrice (when will be honored) and Simon Callow CBE are equally the same. It really is Salieri's film overall told from his point of view. You can't forget Mozart's unique laugh and his desire for his father's love who wants him back in Salzburg than in Vienna. Salieri's father died while he was young. We don't see much of the women in the film but that is expected since you expect that women were still second class citizens. Salieri envied Mozart's genius as well as zest for life outside music.

64,7 February 2011,ElMaruecan82,10," In the Name of God, Mozart, and the Holy Music ...","""Amadeus"", is a powerful portrayal of jealousy's poisoning effect in the heart of the envious. F. Murray Abraham turns his performance as Salieri, the unsung hero of the classical music Golden Age into the unforgettable fictional villain who killed Mozart, after he murdered his own soul, by making God his enemy. The title holds therefore a particularly ironic meaning if you think of Salieri's relationship with God. Amadeus is not just Mozart's middle name but means also ""beloved by God"", which obviously contradicts Salieri's personal sentiment before guiding all his vengeful actions  not against Mozart, but against God. Salieri is the personification of the inferiority complex which, when dangerously mixed with frustration, gives birth to evil. However, Salieri is probably one of the most sympathetic cinematic villains, because despite our reluctance to admit it, we can relate to his feelings. In this world, there are and have been more Salieris than Mozarts, this is God's implacable will, God who inspired Salieri a burning desire of revenge. ",

Sure, it has a simple narrative that is easy to follow but it's more driven by the vision and the experience for the audiences over the narrative. Now this movie has gotten some backlash, mainly because of it's depiction of the historical figures. So yeah, although the story might not entirely be focused on telling the exact truth, it does a fine job of blending fiction with reality. Because it does have important scenes that are deemed to be historically accurate or assumed to be. Never the less, the main focal point of this movie isn't to tell the step by step of Mozart's life. But to make it a experience that would draw the audiences in with it's depth and soul. Even the directing style comes of slightly strange when it comes down to it. So the story is told from the perspective of Antonio Salieri who was one of the well known composer during his prime as a composer. But in this film he is depicted as a mediocre composer trying to be more than what he is. Salieri in this comes across as a overly self-righteous, pompous jerk that has a huge jealousy towards the musical prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Since Mozart in this film is portrayed as a party guy that loves the ladies and just like enjoying the moment with his lavish spendings. Which kind of makes him a rock star during his time period. And since the demeanor of Antonio Salieri is vastly different from Mozart, Salieri not only makes Mozart his rival but his sworn enemy. Sometimes people like to pick apart and only try to focus on the negative side of someone they are jealous towards and that really shows through Salieri in this. He is a character that will do whatever it takes to bring Mozart down by slowly diminishing Mozart's chances to show his musical talents to the world to see. In this, while Mozart is a musical prodigy Salieri is a mediocre composer that is gifted in scheming, manipulating and has a very cunning persona. It shows the colliding of personalities and the ill intentions of Salieri as he picks apart Mozart. I also found Mozart's focus when it comes to his music and how he enjoyed life and his family to be touching and yet interesting. May it be entirely true or not, the man was a musical genius and his music will continue to carry on for generations. Overall though, this is a intriguing movie that I thoroughly enjoyed despite it being 3 hours. It's quite a depressing film though, so I probably wouldn't pick it up immediately to watch it again.

This is a terribly flawed, disappointing film that's unjustly considered a classic. It had great potential, a biography of the great Mozart seen through the eyes of a mediocre composer, but the result fails in many areas and leaves one confused and hugely disappointed. Everything about this film is top-notch except for one crucial element: the script. It lacks punch, it lacks heart, it lacks momentum, and it lacks any particularly memorable dialogue. The actors do their best with this below-par script, and so does the director and the entire crew, who deserved their Oscars, but the film really suffers from its by-the-numbers screenplay by Peter Schaffer. It's clear he's a passionate music-lover, but it's also clear he isn't able to construct a compelling narrative too. I've never seen the play, but I've heard it's better than this film. I certainly hope so. Somehow those moments that are intended to generate emotions in the audience never really pay off. We never feel like something horrible has happened, the events onscreen never really involve you, but make you hope the film will get better. Playing loud classical music on the background for dramatic impact may be effective for some, but not for me. However, the film is exceptionally well filmed. The cinematography, sets, and costumes make this a real visual treat, and the actors are all wonderful in their roles. And of course the classical music score makes for wonderful listening. With all these impressive elements, it's a shame that the film's core, the script, is so bland and uninvolving. No matter how good a cast and crew you've got at your disposal, if your script is mediocre, then your movie will be too, and AMADEUS is perfect proof of this.",

Where do I even begin with this beauty!? Both a visual and aural treat that celebrates the work of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The sublime music is beautiful interwoven into the narrative which makes the biopic absolutely spellbinding. Salieri is just as fascinating and important as Mozart. Played phenomenally by F. Murray Abraham, Salieri is maddened with envy after discovering Mozart and his divine musical gifts. He literally utilises any means necessary to see that Mozart fails as a composer, but beneath this cold exterior is an individual who yearns for greatness. The fear of his work being forgotten and diminished by a far superior talent. It's a bittersweet tale, one that hauntingly resonates with me. Tom Hulce was impeccable as Mozart, the laugh alone was stupendously charismatic. Forman's direction was perfect, embedding luscious operas into a savage rivalry. Using classical music to push the story forward. It was just sublime, it really was. The period costumes were accurate and authentic. Vienna's rich and lavish lifestyle was conveyed eloquently. The script was sharp and injected plenty of charisma into these characters with many subtle humorous moments. The first act does take a while to get going, but once the ignition is on Amadeus is the gift that keeps on giving. So so so close to perfection.

He does this by murdering 	  Mozart who he can see has been given just such a gift. The star of the film has got to be the music and this totally changed my attitude towards classical music. The 	  directors cut adds a few scenes that mean a few of the original scenes make more sense. This was the role of a lifetime for 	  F Murray Abraham and the rest of the cast and especially Simon Callow are excellent.,

What we get is one of the most exceptionally made films of our time, consisting of wonderful sets and performances, especially by F. Murray Abraham.

Its reputation among young people is that it is stodgy, high-brow, and boring. But in the midst of this perceived dormancy, Paul Shaffer and Milos Forman decided on another tactic: using the power of cinema to release the power, drama and excitement of classical music. Their answer was AMADEUS, a semi-fictionalized account of the opera scene in Vienna, Austria, during the late 18th century. Although many of the finer details are fictional, the film captures a larger historical picture of the exhilarating atmosphere of the late 18th-century. At the time, the arts were climbing toward a pinnacle in Europe, and Amadeus shows how music played an unrivaled role in high culture. ",

Therefore I was put off by Tom Hulce's fey portrayal of the legendary composer, and struggled to accept the characterization offered here. However the picture seems to have more to say about Austrian court composer Antonio Salieri, and the relationship he developed with Mozart upon learning how unprincipled and downright vulgar the man was. Repressing his own personal desires, Salieri comes to realize he will never be as masterful a musician as the much younger Mozart, at once blaming himself and God for the talent he can never hope to acquire. This was skillfully conveyed when he read Mozart's musical notes for a particularly important piece, and marveled that there were no corrections or erasures on the finished product. That moment led to the comment in my summary line above, an observation that described Mozart's talent as an almost matter of fact skill rather than the product of some long and laborious process of creation. This was given further support by Mozart himself when he objected to Emperor Joseph's request to rewrite one of his operas - ""I can't rewrite what's perfect"" was the composer's response"" - a comment that would challenge the Emperor to accept all or nothing, such was Mozart's supreme confidence in his own ability.",

Mozart's last days are stretched out inordinately.  Nevertheless, this film has depth, humor, and one of the greatest soundtracks you'll ever hear.  The historical facts are inseparable from the fantasy that forms the basis of the plot, so beware of citing Amadeus as an authority on the lives of Mozart & Salieri.  Mozart was not so unworldly in real life, nor was Salieri so obsessed with his colleague, at least while both were alive.  Mozart's music was very popular throughout Europe, though he didn't earn as much money from his compositions as he deserved.  While Mozart didn't die entirely forsaken, as the movie implies, he was a victim of bad health exacerbated by overwork.  Consider that modern ""recording artists"" like Michael Jackson, et. al. release a dozen new compositions every 4 or 5 years, while Mozart composed two full-length operas and the bulk of a Requiem mass, among other things - several hours of classic music - in a few months, while he was dying.

The whole thing about Salieri murdering Mozart is ridiculous historical fable that's been passed around by people for years, and has less validity than your average second gunner JFK story.  But viewers of this movie will, unfortunately, probably walk away from it thinking that Salieri was a bad, bad man indeed.  This is unfair to his life and his music, but the producers of this hero-worshipping (though also hero-deflating, in the modern ambigously ""realist"" style) flick couldn't care less.

Lacking a good enough slant for a powerful dramatic depiction, the writer latched on to this gimmick to propel the story to a wider audience. While we can be grateful for an opportunity to hear this great music and thrill to the recreation of some of the period settings, we cannot be happy about this distorted approach to biography. Nor can we feel elated over the decision to make the character of Mozart a cackling, show-off buffoon.

115,26 January 2005,esteban1747,8," Mozart, simply a genius","Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was one of the most skilled composer and musician of all time. When he was only six years old he played for the Austrian Empress, later being still a child he played for the French and English royal families, and wrote his first symphonies. He had such an ear that he could remember any piece just listening once. In addition, Mozart's life was a real disorder, although his incomes were high he usually spent more than what he earned, he was also a heavy drunkard and liked to have fun with women other than his wife. I think that Mozart was a child who never matured. All these aspects of Mozart's life are well described in the film of the Czech director Milos Forman. Unfortunately the film concentrated more on Mozart's deeds in Vienna, and nothing was shown about his travel to Italy, where he wrote two operas. The unproven legend that Mozart was killed by Antonio Salieri was shown with some thoughts and ideas of the director and writer of the film. Up to date nobody can really assert that Salieri really poisoned Mozart, the only thing one may accept is that Salieri was really jealous of the extraordinary Mozart's skills, but to kill him is another story, a bit strange. The most shocking fact in the film, probably it is true, is that Mozart was buried in a common hole without any grave for him. Although with his disordered life he contributed to his poverty, such a genius just put in that hole is to me an injustice. The film has some polemic issues, but one must acknowledge that it is a sound work and an important contribution to make Mozart's life known.",

Even though Salieri knows Mozart is a genius, his jealousy craves the ranting towards Mozart's music, such as the Emporer's (Jones) criticism of one of Mozart's pieces having ""too many notes"". It appears Forman and Shaffer should have taken their own advice, as the film starts to drag significantly during the second half, mainly due to drawn out opera scenes. As the film comes to an end, the viewer can't help but feel satisfied by, not only a well-told story, but also (and more importantly) the brilliance of music contained in the film.

Murray Abraham, Jeffrey Jones, Elizabeth Berridge, Roy Dotrice, Christine Ebersole, Charles Kay, Barbara Bryne, Simon Callow, Kenny Baker, Herman Meckler, Cynthia Nixon. Director Milos Foreman Best Picture Of The Year For 1984, Amadeus was previously a smash Broadway play by Peter Schaffer. The film boasts an extensive Mozart score, authentic period costumes and stunning cinematography, not to mention the first-rate performances by all the principal actors, particularly in F. Murray Abraham's portrayal of the wicked and jealous rival composer Antonio Salieri, a performance which earned his Best Actor Oscar. Amadeus is a fine introduction to the times of Mozart and his music, and many music history classes find it worthy class viewing material, but truthfully, the play and the film was so compelling for the reason it was mostly fictional. Any learned music scholar will tell you that Salieri never killed Mozart nor was insanely jealous the way he is in this movie. Mozart is portrayed as a flamboyant man-child, an excessive hedonist and a vulgar, smart-aleck rebel. He may not have been this wild in real life. He did in fact drink and party too much and his alcohol problem gave way to his liver complications which resulted in death. His musical genius is never in question, though and that part is at least accurate. Emperor Joseph (played by Jeffrey Jones) was indeed a great patron of his music. Small-theater manager Emmanuel Schikaneder (played by Simon Callow) was a friend of Mozart and collaborated in the production of ""The Magic Flute"", even acting and singing the part of Papageno, as shown in the film. There are some truths to the film concerning Mozart's childhood and his constant hand-to-mouth lifestyle and the fact his father Leopold never approved of him as an adult. There are genuine moments of humor and brilliant screen writing, such as the scene in which his wife Constanza shows Salieri a sample of Mozart's music, and Salieri is in awe at the music. Other great scenes include Salieri burning a cross and giving up his Catholic faith, believing God has abandoned him, a dying Mozart composing the Requiem with the help of Salieri, who is only there to see he dies. The opening scene, in which Salieri attempts suicide, is also quite powerful, and opens the film rather well. Salieri's final monologue at the asylum, in which he proclaims himself the patron saint of mediocrities everywhere is also poignant. Pathetic he is, but somehow it's rather sad to see him fall to pieces that way. The music is what makes this film especially good, at least for me. The soundtrack is unbeatable, full of a plethora of Mozart's piano concerti, operas (Figaro, Don Giovanni and Magic Flute) chamber works and of course the final piece - the Requiem. The movie is rather dark in that Salieri seems to give up his humanity for the sake of extracting revenge, consumed by jealousy and envy of a man he felt superior to him musically. This is a well-made DRAMA, but not a history lesson in music. But as a drama, one must admit it's wonderful. I, for one, was on the side of Mozart, Constanza and their son, and absolutely disliked the stuffy, snobbish Court at Vienna. The late 18th century period, from horse-drawn carriages, to the way operas were performed, to the interior of the homes, is all remarkably real. It remains a great film and justly deserved its Oscar.",

Salieri confesses to the Priest sent to converse with him after his suicide attempt, that he devised several plans in order to stunt Mozart's success. Salieri was fiercely jealous of Mozart's ability, and how seemingly natural that ability came to him, as Salieri devoted his life to composition mastery yet couldn't hold a candle to Mozart's compositions. Salieri promised his chastity to God in hopes of being imparted the gift of music by the hand of Christ. Salieri enjoys a comfortable living and career as court composer to Austrian Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). The envy of Salieri eventually engulfs his entire being; he is dumbfounded as to why God could choose such an immature, petulant child to instill his most precious musical talents in.

123,16 March 2005,gengar843,8, Scribbling and Bibbling,"I would like to make some short comments. 1. Acting - a. F. Murray Abraham - there wasn't much for him to do except brood. Flashes of intensity, but for the most part, he seems swept through the action by happenstance. b. Tom Hulce - over-the-top performance still made believable by the restraint of the script. Especially convincing is Mozart dictating to Salieri. c. Elizabeth Berridge - unconvincing, underplayed to a fault. Relying on script and costuming is a poor way to make a living as an actress. d. Jeffrey Jones - made an impact on me as a catalyst and not a flunky of the circumstances. Leopold's brief interactions are nonetheless very important to the storyline. 2. Writing - the plot line is pretty cool: a little bit of Hitchcock straining at the leash, but mainly we're treated to a chronology of Mozart's works, albeit truncated and jumpy. The subplots concerning Mozart's father and Wolfie's wife are thin, and to me don't add any substance to the transitions nor the ending. What stands out is the God-given talent of Mozart, which is brilliantly displayed in both the context and the acting. Hulce brings to life the torture of genius. What it feels like to be blessed by God, which can also be a curse. He has all the music in his head, and the rest is just ""scribbling and bibbling."" To say that Mozart worked himself to death wouldn't be outlandish, even knowing that his alcoholism contributed mightily. But which was the killer? Was it the strain of dealing with all the music that wanted to be released, or was it liver and/or kidney failure? The ambiguities here and in Salieri's story are riveting, if ultimately unsatisfying. One moral I came away with: be happy for what you DO have, for jealousy will drive you mad as surely as ambition will drive you into the earth. 3. Design - costuming was heroic, and the settings were impeccable. The extras were very believable, and the atmosphere reeked of baroque. A little more definition of Vienna was perhaps needed just to reel you in a little deeper, but I'm being trifling here. 4. Music - I'm not crazy for Mozart, but I walked away with a greater appreciation for the prodigy and his vocation. I've always looked on Wolfgang Amadeus, the composer, as very pompous in his assumptions concerning the listener, and this was pointed out in the film as well. Nevertheless, the pieces are short enough to placate my A.D.D. and yet long enough to satisfy my curiosity. 5.

After that viewing, I fell in love with that movie.  The costumes, the art direction, and the music!  F. Murray Abraham is perfect as the tortured Salieri, a mediocre composer that plots and schemes against the loutish, but incredibly gifted, Mozart.  Tom Hulce gives Mozart a boyish charm, and that laugh!  That high pitched giggle that haunts Salieri till the very end.  The music of Mozart is heard constantly through out the film. You can see the foreshadowing and hear it, whenever Mozart's father appears. And when the Don Giovanni piece appears, it all makes sense.  The best scene in the film is when Mozart is ill, and Salieri sees this as his chance to get even with God.  Mozart hears the music that will eventually become the Requiem, all in his head.  As he dictates the score, Salieri becomes overwhelmed by the genius of Mozart.  But, the ultimate indignation for this great composer comes at the end.  The Lacrymosa is playing and we see Mozart's final resting place.  A mass, unmarked grave.  All dramacticaly punctuated by a massive choir, and you feel just like the priest that is taking Salieri's confession.  A great film that showcases music by one of the greatest composers ever to live.",

He drank, he barely slept, he didn't seem to have a normal, consistent diet, he blew through his money. The pplz back then had a low life-expectancy then, my goodness. He certainly didn't do himself any favors Lol :-P I still sympathized with him. But anywhoo, this movie is quite brilliant.

On the one hand, there is Salieri, a man whose entire life is devoted to music and who can't think of anything else 24/7, but who lacks the genius it takes to be remembered for his work by people two hundred years from now. And then, Mozart: a childish, immature kid who composes the greatest operas ever with the utmost easiness and who knows that he is a genius and therefore despises all the musicians and composers that are beneath him. I feel with Salieri. He is not an unsympathetic character at all, I understood most of his actions and I truly understand why he is envious of Mozart. After all, he is right: What is the point in working your life out in order to create something that will be forgotten the minute you die or even before. What is the point of striving for some kind of recognition, if, no matter what you do, there are at least a thousand people who know how to do it better? If you think of all the works of art throughout the centuries then there is probably just a handful of works that are worth being mentioned. Think of all the people who devoted their entire life to art but who never managed to amuse anyone but contemporary society. It's a shame, isn't it.

Yet, as I watched ""Amadeus,"" though Tom Hulce was exceptional as Mozart, it was F. Murray Abraham with whom I was most impressed. He is PERFECT as Salieri, and he does one of the best acting jobs I have ever seen in my life in this part. He plays his character in such a real and believable way that I was completely taken in by him. Also, so great is his talent, that it took me about five times of watching the movie all the way through (and checking the credits!) to realize that it was the same actor playing ""Old Salieri"" and ""Middle-aged Salieri"" throughout the movie. I recommend that you see this movie just of Abraham alone, though the entire thing is a masterpiece. I went out and bought a cd of Mozart's Requiem Mass after seeing it just twice! Overall, this movie is intriguing and entertaining, and the actors are perfect. No one could have played Mozart better than Tom Hulce, and I don't think I have to mention how amazing F. Murray Abraham is as Salieri again. I give it a 10/10. Simply fantastic.",

Mozart's work was considered the work and voice of God himself, and many including Salieri could not understand why God would give such amazing talent to such an undeserving man. Crude, vulgar, immature, and irresponsible, Mozart was all of these things...but he was also the source of music that had no equal and talent beyond all comprehension. Court Composer Salieri felt that he could not let God get away with such hypocrisy and made it his sole purpose in life to ruin and destroy the man who mocked him and highlighted his mediocrity.

147,4 December 2008,kyle-cruse,10, What a great film,"There simply aren't enough good things to be said about ""Amadeus."" This is an Oscar-winning Best Picture that truly lives up to its reputation, and is a personal favorite as much as a critical one. This film is full of fascinating (and funny) scenes, one of my favorites being Mozart (Tom Hulce) playing Salieri's (F. Murray Abraham) piece from memory after hearing it once and criticizing it somewhat unintentionally. An example of how great the film-making in this movie is involves the scene where Salieri helps Motzart finish his composition as he lies in bed dying. What Salieri learns from this is simply amazing, and it doesn't deserve to be spoiled here. The film is masterfully told in flashback, as Salieri reports the story as an old man in a confession to a priest. The film is not really a true-to-life biography of Motzart's life, and many of the interesting little facts, as well as the whole plot element of Salieri conspiring against Motzart, are more or less implied, speculated, or just plain made up. That's not the point, however. The film takes a true story that would ordinarily bore audiences and turns it into a movie that is highly entertaining, funny, and remarkable. I'm sure many people can relate to Salieri and what he must feel, knowing that in real life, there is always someone better than us. This Oscar-winning role makes the character of Salieri completely believable, allowing us to feel the envy that grows throughout the film and the redemption he feels toward the end. The only drawbacks to this movie are the mediocre acting jobs done by a few of the supporting characters, such as Motzart's wife, which don't really fit with the great acting done by the lead characters. Nevertheless, this does not ruin the movie by any means. This is highly recommended, even to those who don't tend to like biography or history films. Almost perfect.",

One of the best classical composers was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, whose life is brought to the screen in Milos Forman's Amadeus. Well, not all of his life as most of what is portrayed in the film never actually happened in real life. That is not a flaw of the film, however, as Peter Shaffer manages to still create a fascinating story that keeps us gripped throughout the three hour running time.

His wife lazes in bed by day yet offers sensible advice. Then there is the court composer who narrates the film in a confession to a Priest in an institution. Director Milos Forman creates one of his best films complete with glorious art direction. Tom Hulce is flawless as Mozart who knows how good he is despite his outbursts in creative expression. F. Murray Abraham plays off the envy of Salieri who hates Mozart yet loves the music to the point where he forces the unfinished final work even when Mozart is on his death bed. Elizabeth Berridge plays Mozart's wife who begins as a free spirit young female until marriage where she can sense Salieri's true nature. Roy Dotrice plays off the haunting presence of Leopold Mozart, Wolfgang's strict father. Jeffrey Jones plays Emperor Joseph the second who is also in attendance.

He was of course a highly sophisticated man of the enlightenment. Scheffer appears to have thought that because Mozart wrote crudities into his letters to friends, he was like that with everyone. A totally absurd assumption. At least the film does not go as far as the play in that regard. So while there is much to enjoy here, there is also much that is total rubbish. For example, the implication that Salieri was celibate is complete nonsense as the man was married. He was a very respected composer in his day even though his music went out of fashion. Even as his works dropped from performance, and he wrote no new operas after 1804, he still remained one of the most important and sought-after teachers of his generation, and his influence was felt in every aspect of Vienna's musical life. Franz Liszt, Franz Schubert, Ludwig van Beethoven, Johann Nepomuk Hummel and Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart were among the most famous of his pupils. Not a bad legacy. Rather than being bitter rivals, Salieri and Mozart had a respectful relationship. The other point of the film which is ridiculous is the portrayal of Joseph the Emperor. He was actually a very fine amateur musician. So although it is a very entertaining movie it is rotten history and the problem I have this many people will take it as true. It is hokum.",

Peter Shaffer adapted his own celebrated play and Milos Forman helmed the smooth direction (both won Oscars), but neither is very generous in showing us the creative process behind the music. There's far more love for the classical pieces on display than actual insight into how the music was created. F. Murray Abraham is deliciously dark as Salieri and won the Oscar for Best Actor; Tom Hulce as jolly Mozart is uneven, occasionally forced or strained; supporting cast, too, is variable.

For a large portion of the movie, he has NO dialogue. Just body language and facial expressions as he goes against F Murray Abraham's Oscar winning performance. He gets Abraham's character to speak by offering God's forgiveness. At the end, he is bent over clutching a cross and looks up at the laughing Antonio Salieri with tears on his face and a ""RAGE"" in his eyes by what has happened. Then Salieri comforts him at the end since he speaks for all ""Mediocrities"" as their ""Patron Saint. His performance was incredible. A great tragedy that he died so young and did not have a long productive acting career. Anyone that studies acting should study the scenes he was in during this film.",

For another, I saw this movie knowing that it wasn't completely true to life, but I loved it anyway. Because what really matters is how Hulce and Abraham draw you into their characters, not permitting your eyes to leave the screen. What really matters is the fact that the movie is very entertaining in its own right- with its humor, both dark and light (I laughed every time Mozart laughed, and then even at Mozart's dad's mask), along with a witty and quotable screenplay (""I may be a vulgar man, but I assure you my music is not""). What really matters is how Forman combines everything to really show us the passion Mozart had for his music and how Mozart was a touch above Salieri when it came to music- Salieri could recognize how extraordinary Mozart's music was but could not create it himself. My favorite scene is when Salieri helps Mozart write the end of his mass. Forman wisely does not distract with anything extra and simply shifts back and forth between the two characters, allowing the actors to do their work with their faces. When I was watching this movie again for the second time, I had forgotten about that scene, and watching it again, I could not take my eyes off the TV. In fact, I think I had that problem for most of the movie.",
184,6 January 2005,igor-28,10, Wrong Profession,"The story of Salieri is classic. The guy just chose the wrong profession. He should have become a music critic, not a musician. He wants to compose to the glory of God, but fails, simply because he is not talented enough. On the other side he has the gift to see the astonishing talent and genius of Mozarts music. Thats what makes Salieri a unique character in recent film history. The best critic ever seen on screen in a leading role. Besides that, Mozart is not the leading character in this movie. We see Mozart from the eyes of an admirer. Thats why we get a totally wrong impression from the life and work of this musical genius. The ultimate climax of the movie, the requiem scene in Mozarts flat shows the melting of two characters into one. Salieri becomes Mozart for a night. The synthesis of criticism and creativity.",
185,19 May 2009,footballer239,8, Jealousy is a Man's Best Friend,"""Amadeus"" was a historical biography about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The movie opens with an old man in a wheelchair, whispering Italian. This man, Saleri, plays a key character. Saleri plays as the narrator for some parts in which he is telling about his past and being with Mozart. He then has flashbacks of when he was a court composer and Mozart was just in his youth. Saleri was in love with the music that came from Mozart and was somehow always around Mozart when he had come up with new music. Saleri, himself, being so intrigued with the music and melodies, came up with his own composure's to try and please the Emperor. The Emperor is pleased, however, has Amadeus play it and while doing so, he changes a few keys here and there. This made Saleri upset because Amadeus did this quite often and leads us to believe that Saleri should've been the ""real celebrity."" A lot of Mozarts ideas are inspired by Saleri but with no credit given to him. Amadeus is married and has four children but the movie only portrayed one. He is quite the drunk, he spent all his time writing material and the moment he got paid for it, he spends it all on going out and getting drunk. He has the nice house and all, but his only happiness is coming up with music for everyone to hear. Even though this film is historical, I enjoyed the plot. Describing someone's life is definitely not easy, but Peter Shaffer did a great job with coming up with the plots and screen work. And showing the inside drama within each of the leading characters (Amadeus and Saleri) was interesting and led you into each of their lifes. The acting and music was great, I liked that they actually used his own works and used them correctly. The dramatics between roles were extreme but not the point where it was too much. And having Amadeus have a ridiculous laugh made it more enjoyable and more humorous. Some things I think the director should've pushed more for would be a better German accent. These characters seemed to have more of an English talk. The way they made Amadeus seem like nothing more than a drunk, turned me away. In many scenes in which he was coming up with plays, he always had some sort of drink in his hands, making it seem like it was his only getaway. They made Saleri seem more of like the jealous type and that the only thing he was living for was to get revenge on Amadeus, when in fact Saleri was quite the composer himself and is well-known. With the time transition, they should've made the characters age as years went on. Amadeus looked just about the same the whole movie. The choice of the cast was great, to me there were no actors that are too well-known and would be more favorable than others just because of their acting experience. They made acting seem effortless Amadeus is obviously a story about Wolfgang Mozart and his life. its factual, yet comical. The acting is great and holds drama you don't want to miss. If your into music, biographies, good humor, and a man's jealousy, this movie is definitely worth your time. I would rate ""Amadeus,"" by Milos Forman 8 out of 10. Great movie with a killer laugh!!",

Theoretically that is, of course, true, but try telling that to Antonio Salieri, a leading musician of his time who has reached the highest heights only to run across Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart who, as far as Salieri is concerned, is composing music on another plane, one inaccessible to mere mortals, in short Salieri felt a little like Bing Crosby when Frank Sinatra appeared on the popular music scene. Foreman's film, which is sumptuous and chock full of music, is really about Salieri rather than Mozart and F. Murray Abraham manages to inhabit the embittered Italian admirably whilst Tom Hulce offers light relief as a Mozart who is portrayed as immature at all times except when actually composing.

F.Murray Abraham in particular gives arguably the greatest performance in movie history as Antonio Salieri. He manages wonderfully to convey the pathos and contradictions of his character, caught as he is between admiration and hatred for Mozart, between his humility and passion for music and his consuming envy of the foul mouthed little genius who outshines him. Practically every scene is a masterpiece. Add to that the music of Mozart, Salieri, Haydn and others and you have a recipe for sheer perfection.

""This was a music I'd never heard,"" he says, ""Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing, it had me trembling. It seemed to me that I was hearing the voice of God.""

It seems that if you claim to being a failure, people are willing to believe it to be a fact. Western Society likes ""winners"".

The fact that many reviewers approve of this movie & rate it so highly is proof of this. I'm not against American culture per se (far from it) but the Americanisation of history in films (i.e. which gives the impression that many significant figures from the past grew up somewhere near Disneyland) is a terrible thing - it whitewashes cultural diversity & gives a totally distorted view of the world as it was, and still is. This cannot be overlooked. If an Austrian actor was chosen for the part (not Arnie) the film probably would have made less money so I guess that wasn't an option? Better to cast someone who appeared in ""Animal House""? Instead of a ""Directors' cut"" how about a ""Realistic cut""? Please explain?...well, if one of the characters in ""Amadeus"" had stepped out to buy a cheeseburger from Macdonald's or had switched on ""MTV"" at some point in this movie, it would not have seemed out of place - in what's supposed to be the story of an Austrian composer who lived in the 18th century!

207,19 August 2005,arthurclay,10, The Music and the Madness but was it really Murder? *SPOILERS*,"*SPOILER ALERT* I had never understood why this movie was so coveted until now. I had watched it when I was about 10 years old and at that time it made absolutely no sense at all much as the Godfather was incomprehensible to me. Having watched it again the pieces fall right into place. F. Murray Abrahams is dynamite and just blows you out of the water with his performance and he's not the only one. Tom Hulce is the gasoline that gets the blaze going. The two of them are bigger than the Fourth of July. Before I watched this I knew that Mozart was a genius of music. I didn't realize that he was THE genius of music. There has never been anything like him before or since. He did for music what electricity did for light bulbs. Here are two men that are rivals. Bitter rivals. It is impressed upon you in every scene. Salieri is great, a true living legend. And he hates Mozart, not because he is better than him but because he is a unsophisticated, uncultured, impish childlike boob. He wants him dead. Does everything he can to utterly ruin him and make him fail. But he loves his music and operas completely, unabashedly and without limits. Covets and appreciates his talent like no one ever could and knows without doubt Mozart is the best composer in the world. But he won't let Amadeus succeed. As a result, Mozart sinks deeper and deeper into a pit of alcoholism, sickness and depression. Wife leaves him and he's flat broke. His father's death haunts him like a demon released from purgatory. Salieri hastens if not actually perpetuates his death and what does Mozart tell him on his deathbed? That he thought Salieri didn't like his music and that he respected Salieri more than anyone and begs his forgiveness for being so wrong! That is a biggest slap in the face I've ever seen delivered on screen. It takes the cake for pure cinematic irony. Mozart, in all probability would have died regardless of what happened but Salieri cannot and will not forgive himself for what he has so underhandedly done to Mozart and even more importantly to the world of music. The way this film is told is brilliant and I'm not surprised it won the many coveted awards it did as it certainly deserved them. Best film of 1984.",

I really prepared to like it. I love this kind of theme: 'the burden bestowed together with gift. By the end you are not sure how to look at a genius mind: a blessing or a curse.' But it turned out to me a major disappointment. I was most deeply let down by the portrait of Mozart. I wouldn't have mind it so much if the movie hasn't kept on pressing the point via the statement of Salieri: the contradiction within Mozart - God's voice from a unworthy man. The movie totally failed itself in this aspect. On one hand Salieri went on and on with how magnificent and brilliant Mozart's music is that my head starts to ache. On the other hand Mozart has shown himself as a funny, sincere, self-confident man, cute and cuddly, with an off-beat laugh, a loyal son, a tender husband, simply an example of morality. It is a mystery that how come he didn't become the most popular man in Vienna. So many other works have done it much better, 'moon and six pence' and 'shine' to name a few, over the dark anti-social side of genius that 'Amadeus' in corporation only offered a very pale and shallow endeavor. Another thing bugged me is the other main character Salieri. He blamed himself to madness and tempted suicide. For what? What EXACTLY had he done to Mozart? True, he has not been a true friend to Mozart. Is that the reason Mozart died? No way. Those little tricks he had applied to harm Mozart, did they succeed? You better be kidding me. From what I can see they either missed miserably or by the unexpected turn of events helped Mozart instead. He hated Mozart and wished him dead, but that didn't make him a murderer. The director overdid the contrast between the two main characters and massed it up. And, the maid, played by the one of the ladies out of the sex and city. What an annoy! She lamenting 'Oh I am scared!' For what! and tears over Mozart's death. Again, for what? When did she grow so emotional over Mozart? What the director was thinking, did he forgot the story? Everybody hates Mozart, right? In conclusion, everything is pretty lame here, plot, direction and acting. Only recommended if you are an opera nut. Otherwise, skip it.",

216,22 October 2003,ericsinla,10, The Best Movie Yet Written!!!,"Without a doubt one of the best movies of all time Amadeus is also the one movie that has it all, drama, laughs, great music, spectacle, and of coarse GREAT ACTING!  Is there a better-acted, more thrilling scene in all of cinema than the one at the end between Mozart and Salieri ?  F.Murray Abraham and Tom Hulse give us a tour de force that has seldom been seen in movies. 	Most people know the story of Amadeus so it's fruitless going into to many of the films main - plot points. It might help to note however that a lot of what is portrayed in the film is fictitious, Salieri didn't actually sit at Mozart's deathbed while he dictated the Requiem, this is fiction, but it is the stuff great dramas are made of.  On the director cut version of the film Peter Shaffer explains that the ending is his favorite scene in the whole movie because it is so unlike any other Hollywood movie.  Here is a climax of a film and it is basically two men composing a piece of music, no explosion, no shootout, and yet it is exciting.   Of coarse the set up and the story of Salieri's mad jealousy are all part why that scene works so well. Many other details of the actual story of Mozart are also fiction yet many other parts of the story are in fact true.   By combining fact and myth Peter Shaffer has created a truly great drama. This is also a movie that looks and sounds amazing. And although it evokes the 18th century perhaps more authentically than any movie this is also a film that refuses to take itself too seriously.  Milos Forman is a genius for the way he brought this play to the screen.  Another director may have made a dull, overly dramatic piece out of Shaffer's play. Instead he choose to make every part of the story interesting, from his ""cartoon casting"" of secondary roles (the Emperor Joseph and his Court), to his giving us whole Operatic Arias, to his casting of virtually unknowns ( Hulse and F.Murray are brilliant ) in the major roles,  Amadeus  is about as good as movies get. I love this movie, 10/10.",
217,6 September 2008,Cosmoeticadotcom,6, Solid,"I found that the film was not at all as I expected- a staid Merchant-Ivory type production mixed with a hint of Masterpiece Theater. This was both good and bad. On the positive side is the very dramatic structure of the film, being told from Mozart's inferior rival's, Antonio Salieri's (F. Murray Abraham), point of view. On the down side is the over the top performance by Tom Hulce, as Mozart, especially with that pointlessly distracting guffaw. Also, as the DVD delineates which scenes were altered, extended, or added in toto, it becomes obvious that director Milos Forman's original cut was the superior, as none of the added scenes adds palpably to the thrust of the film. Yes, I liked the added scene of Mozart's wife, Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge), getting naked to try to sexually please Salieri, to advance her husband's career, for Berridge was certainly a major hotty with the body back then, but, despite my prurient interest, the scene is pointless. Unfortunately, in either version, this is nowhere near a great film. It's a fun, solid romp, but the American accents and slang that infiltrate Eighteenth Century Viennese society are just too much, as is Hulce as Mozart. No, a staid portrayal of the man would have been dull, but a genius as idiot savant, or a step above, is not worthy of this dramatic treatment, either. That it only heightens Salieri's frustration is dramatically defensible, but since the whole notion of Salieri's envy and hatred of Mozart is a historical fiction, there really was no reason to go so over the top in the first place.",
218,13 July 2010,jboothmillard,10, Amadeus,"I knew that this film was about a music composer, I had heard heard things about what the plot line might involve, and I knew it was Oscar and Golden Globe winning director Milos Forman (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest). I have to say, I would have watched this film even if I hadn't heard all these things, about the awards and success, especially as it featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Basically, it is the 18th Century, old and retired former composer Antonio Salieri (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated F. Murray Abraham) has attempted suicide, and a priest is listening to him recount his past. Salieri tells him the story of his encounters with eccentric music composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Tom Hulce), he adores his music, but his personality is a little less likable for him. Salieri wished to God that he could become the most successful composer, possibly of all time, but he believes his Lord is praising Mozart with this great gift for music, so he is madly jealous. He renounces God and tries to think of ways to stop the run of success for Mozart, but this is hard to do when Emperor Joseph II (Golden Globe nominated Jeffrey Jones) and other connoisseurs are in the way. It is when Mozart goes into frowned upon material for opera that he may be lowering his success rate, e.g. the wrong languages for a certain language story, and less shows and people are watching and listening, it's not that their bad, it's that they are possibly too good. There is finally the point where Mozart collapses with so much stress on his mind making the music and keeping his wife Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge) happy, so Salieri is more than happy to ""help"" Mozart finish his possible final piece. In the end, Mozart dies (most likely of fever), and you are left with the idea that it was Salieri praying to his God that killed him, but he was certainly mad enough to be a villain. Also starring Simon Callow as Emanuel Schikaneder, Roy Dotrice as Leopold Mozart, Christine Ebersole as Katerina Cavalieri, Charles Kay as Count Orsini-Rosenberg and Star Wars' Kenny Baker as Parody Commendatore. Abraham is certainly a great villain worthy of awards, and Hulce even though he didn't win is a great counterpart, the supporting cast all have their moments too. I think the main reason I rate it really highly, besides a great cast and story, was the magnificent music, Mozart was definitely the finest music composer of his time, and seeing a biographic drama about him is brilliant. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Make Up Artist and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay.

221,22 April 2006,glennsouthall,10, Salieri does not hate Mozart.,"First of all, let me say that Amadeus is as flawless a movie as I have ever seen, with probably the finest acting job in motion picture history in F.Murray Abraham's portrayal of Salieri. It is a delight for the eyes, for the ears and the heart from beginning to end. But I am only repeating most reviewer's comments in saying this. What I wanted to pick up on is that time after time I read in the reviews of Salieri's hatred for Mozart....but this could not be further from the truth. Salieri is consumed with hatred, that much is true, but not for Mozart, rather for himself and a fickle God. He hates himself when realising in his heart that he will only ever be mediocre and God who should mock his mediocrity by bestowing the very gifts that he had coveted (genius and popularity)in the form of a crude and childlike person such as Mozart.",

Murray Abraham's performance is perfect, I try to find one scene where he's not so good, and there's none. Those scenes where he recalls his history with Mozart to the priest is especially well done. Salieri adores Mozart's music genuinely and resents his god given talent bitterly.

Based on Peter Shaffer's play, ""Amadeus"" illustrates in flashback through narrator Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) the contradictive genius behind child prodigy Mozart (Tom Hulce), a man with a gift for musical symphony underlying a childish, though unintentional facade.  Caught in a tug-of-war between 18th-century censorship techniques of the Viennese court of Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones) and his own regrettable appreciation of Mozart's revolutionary genius, Salieri embarks upon a subplot which occasionally results in him being lost in his own autobiography.

The life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, from the angle of his relationships with Hapsburg Emperor Joseph II's Court Composer, Antonio Sallieri. Mozart is here described as a naughty spoiled brat, misbehaving with ladies, disrespectful of authority, wasting the money he really does not have. Overall, a man yearning for the youth he had been denied, a genius laughing at the inability of common people, a human being tortured by the music he cannot live without. Sallieri on the other hand, second-rate musician but true lover of music, probably understands Mozart better than anybody else. ""Here was the very voice of God"", he says of Mozart's music. ""I was staring through the cage of meticulous ink stokes at an absolute beauty"". But he cannot bring himself to help the genius he is so jealous of. Indeed, he will destroy him (""I will ruin your incarnation"", says he to God) and destroy himself in the process. A masterpiece, powerful, beautiful, enhanced by Mozart's music. Brilliant.",

Yes it is not historically accurate. Yes it is Americans and British actors playing foreign roles with no accents. Yes it is a ""stuffy period piece."" You know what? It is also an absolute masterpiece of a movie! The story manages to work on multiple levels. Yes the surface message deals with the ""price of revenge,"" but it is so much more personal than that. We see that Sallieri has become his own worst enemy purely because he cannot let go of his jealousy. He cannot just accept the skills of others and move on with his own already successful career. This is also paralleled in the life of Mozart, shown here as a childish genius who is trapped in his own prison of inflated ego in no small part because of his father. The film covers topics of faith, the fear of failure, the dark side of entertainment, the way class and talents are not in stone and more. It works organically and manages to be incredibly captivating.",
235,19 May 2009,fsugirl0408,8, the movie making you want more,"1. The Movie Making You Want More 2. When I heard about the film Amadeus, I was not very thrilled about seeing it. I didn't think I would be very interested or even like the movie in the end. As I watched the film I started liking it more and more. I feel this film deserved all the Academy Awards that it won. 3. Amadeus is a film about Mozart's life while in Vienna. Antonio Salieri is out to kill him because he is jealous of his success. The film starts out with Salieri in an insane institution looking back and telling a priest the whole story of Mozart. Mozart starts out in Salzburg, but soon gets kicked out of the town and decides to move to Vienna to further his career. With the help of the emperor of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, Mozart is composing many various operas and writing symphonies. Mozart meets the love of his life Constanze and they have a child together. She is by his side the whole time, supporting him and praising him for the work he is doing. Mozart thinks that Salieri is actually trying to help him and one of his friends, but little does he know that Salieri is hoping that he dies. In the end, Constanze leaves him to decide and take some time away because Mozart has a very bad drinking problem. She eventually comes back, but doesn't come back to find the happiest thing. 4. I really enjoyed the film because of all the colors and settings. The settings were very broad and stood out. All the costumes and makeup were bright and catching of the eye. The scenery really used big props and had spectacular visual effects. The music was another big factor. The sound was enhanced to keep the viewer interested and wanting more from the film. When something bad was about the happen the music got really loud and the opposite when something good was about to happen. The transitions in the movie were very smooth. The movie didn't switch scenes really fast without warning. 5. I didn't really like how the film wasn't fully portrayed to the fullest. There were a couple things missing and things turned around to make the film more interesting. In real life, Mozart and Constanze actually had four kids. Salieri was not actually jealous of Mozart and he was famous at the time in composing his music. I didn't really like how the movie portrayed Mozart as being a bad person because he went out and partied all the time. This was what kept him going and focused on his music. It also wasn't portrayed well that his wife was nagging him all the time. 6. I really liked all the characters. The actors were all selected very well for playing the characters in this movie. I don't think anyone could have played Mozart better than Tom Hulce. He had the serious times when it was needed and he had a sense of humor. I think certain audience members would be able to relate to certain characters. 7. I would love to see this film again and would recommend it to anyone. I didn't want the movie to end. I thought there was more to come and it just ended. You don't have to appreciate music to see this film. It has much more to offer and is a lot more interesting than someone would think. You also want to see this film to find out what happens at the end. This film is a must see. I would give this movie 8 stars.",
236,10 August 1999,Jim B-2,10, What genre?,"As a biography, the detractors are right. This film is only a 5 on that scale. But IMDb says the genre is Drama. I disagree. But if they are right then this flick is only a 7. And it is that high only because of the magnificent portrayal of the jealous Salieri by F. Murray Abraham. He has redefined Jealousy to include non-sexual jealousy, something Hollywood had forgotten. So classic was this rendition that Bill Buckley now calls Liberalism ""Salieri's Disease."" Once you see the picture you will understand the reference to wanting to destroy those who are more productive or talented. But the true genre is Musical. And the rating there is a 10, although the score is not reflective of the scope or the best of Mozart's compositions. Even so, this is Mozart. That makes the film a 10, and one worth seeing over and over and over!",

Mozart was a man of many moods. childlike in some ways. and naive of the ways of the world in others perhaps. scatological jokes were rampant however in the lives of the southern Germans (mozarts father) and Austrians (mozarts mother). you would have to read of the letters these two sent each other to know that bodily functions in the 18th century were much more out in the open than in todays much greater privacy. that would help explain Mozart's sometimes out of the norm tom foolery. it was part of the patois of the time. still you have occasion to hear some of the most beautiful music written and i suppose be grateful for that. when will we ever have a lifelike portrayal of the great composers? a brilliant spectacle non the less.,

Salieri is perplexed beyond sanity that, in contrast with his own saintly lifestyle, the Chosen One is a vulgar runt who tells filthy jokes, plays around with women, and giggles like a hyena.

The script is impressive, and although the writers may not have been too true to history, they certainly appreciated the otherworldly genius of Mozart.  F.

Well I was quite excited by the thought of a film about one of the greatest composers and musicians of all time, the potential to create really powerful film with some emotional and awe inspiring scenes accompanied by his most famous and rousing music was tremendous and, seemingly, obvious. Instead Amadeus chose to focus on how irritating Mozart the man was, and featured a few uninspiring scenes demonstrating his genius in composition.

No doubt that such a background fostered in his heart a dislike for all formal authority, for legalistic structures, and inspired in his mind a love for that archetypical rebel figure, the one who does not so much fight authority, because he despises it, but through virtue of higher alligence, to his own personal vision or inspiration, simply comports his life as though authority did not exist.",

Why historically inaccurate? Well, I am a big Mozart fan and I've read all the published letters he wrote to his father. Believe me, if Mozart had a disliking to someone, he'd mention it to his father without having reservations. If Mozart ever mentions Salieri in his letters, he refers to him as his colleague and doesn't have one nasty thing to say about him. Salieri never commissioned or helped Mozart with the Requiem score nor did he poisoned him (which also has been rumored) nor did he work him to death. I feel sorry for Salieri because he himself had only nice things to say about his colleagues. I think he deserves better and wonder why he's being portrayed as such a villain. (Bad enough for him no one knows his music...) By the way: Mozart's outrageous giggle which everyone loved and was the onset of an imitation-contest in Italy was ""made in Hollywood"". If the makers of Amadeus would have read the letters he wrote to his wife and niece, they could have dispensed with the fabricated intrigues and use factual material that would make Milos Forman's Mozart look like a choirboy.

286,26 April 2020,SAMTHEBESTEST,8, A miraculous biographical drama set in correct tunes..,"A miraculous biographical drama set in correct tunes. Even if you don't understand much about music and tunes Amadeus will still take you along, that's how powerful it is. I never thought Opera could be so meaningful and profound as i have seen in Amadeus and that too when i don't really understand anything about it. There are so many biographical dramas made over the years but no one came with this kind of uniqueness and proper use of fictional writing. Amadeus is story of Legendary Piano artist Amdeous Mozart but the story is told by guy who used to feel jealous of him. The entire narrative is driven by negative character which doesn't really feel negative when the film ends. Like he says, how could god take him away just to stop mediocrity to have a little share of his glory. Wow, wow, just wow... Amadeus will always remain special and different for this reason that the villain doesn't look a villain and the hero goes less admired than him. In Musical aspects Amadeus explodes all the correct tunes with top class presentation of Opera. F. Murray Abraham won Oscar for the portrayal of Antonio Salieri and the dominance was damn too high. Tom Hulce gets the madness right, his face expressions and that funny laughter seemed amazing. Elizabeth Berridge as her wife gets little enough to do. Coming to the most important person behind this miraculous presentation, the Director The Milos Forman, how do i find words to admire him when i feel like have used all adjectives already for others. I just wanna say this, Dear Milos Forman thank you for showing an art of storytelling in feature film attire. The Combo of Art cinema and motion picture rarely comes together and Amadeus is one fine example of it. I happened to see Director's Cut yet love it so much and soon will catch theatrical version and will surely love it even more than now.

287,19 May 2009,nhalmos,8, Rock Me Amadeus,"The film Amadeus conveys the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, an extremely talented child prodigy who matures into a famous composer. Incidents arise when Salieri, an Italian composer, becomes jealous of Mozart's brilliant work. Amadeus is a brilliant movie which captures the entire essence of music at its best. Mozart's scores are naturally uplifting, and therefore draws a person into the movie with each powerful note. The attire throughout the film provided a very realistic window into Mozart's time period. The beautiful detailed textiles of aristocratic men and women's clothing were brought to life on the big screen. On the flip side, the only negative aspects of the move can be found in the long, drawn out scenes concentrated on Mozart and his opera plays. The scenes could have been cut down into shorter time spans. The film has great comedic relief; however they could have dealt less with crude childish humor (such as when Mozart bent over to relieve flatulence). Casting roles also played an imperative part, making this movie worthy of all its Academy Awards. I quickly fell in love with Tom Hulce playing the part of Mozart. His overall cheery disposition and conceited attitude lightened the mood for what would be a rather dry movie if everything was absent. Frank Murray Abraham's roll as Salieri captured the character's lust to be the ultimate superior to Mozart. His character's script speaks with great use of dramatic detailed imagery. Overall, Amadeus is a terrific movie filled with great costumes, characters, and music. The casting roles fit every character to a tee. I would recommend this movie to a person who adores Mozart's great musical talent. My Rating: 4 out of 5.",
288,22 March 2005,Silver_Dollar,10, A text book definition of a perfect film,"Impeccably executed - A brilliant fusion of music and drama beautifully written and acted. As someone who detests musicals I was spared the My Fair Lady scenes where the protagonists spontaneously breaks into song and instead the music does not dilute the drama and momentum of the film. Neither does the film suffer from the emptiness and superficiality which is prevalent in costume dramas. The brilliant screenplay by Peter Shaffer and the masterful direction of Milos Forman skilfully handles the comedy and tragedy behind Amadeus in a way that leaves the viewer emotionally drained just as he did with One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest. Every creative aspect of this film is perfect from the opulent locations and interior settings of modern day Prague, which were used as a back drop for 17th century Vienna, to the unforgettable performances. Then there is of course the sumptuous score by Neville Marriner which is skilfully employed to enhance the cocktail of emotions on screen. I cannot recommend this film more highly.A must see.",

292,7 January 2023,CinemaSerf,8, Amadeus,"Rarely can I think of a more worthy multi-award winning performance than that from F. Murray Abraham in this masterfully crafted - if entirely speculative - retrospective on the life and times of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (portrayed here by the astonishingly effective Tom Hulce). Abraham portrays the duplicitous, envious and malevolent Antonio Salieri, the court composer to Emperor Joseph II of Austria (Jeffery Jones). He is talented, up to point, and settled in his politically influential and wealthy role, but growing up, he has always been aware of this other young boy who can play, perfectly, composing as he goes. Initially in awe of this man's predigious talent, it isn't long before the green eyed monster starts to rear it's ugly head, and jealousy soon starts to drive his every waking moment. Meantime, the young maestro is attracting more and more attention, acclaim and is soon rivalling Salieri for the attentions of the Emperor himself. At this stage, Salieri must act. How? Well fortunately he is ably assisted by Mozart's own self-destructive character. As a child, compared to a performing monkey, he always had issues with his father (Roy Dotrice) and even when married to Stanzi (Elizabeth Berridge) with his own child, we feel that he is always in search of adulation, appreciation and love whilst treading a very fine line between despair and a chronic fear of poverty and failure - one which leads him to an increasingly addictive existence. What is also striking here, is the extent to which Mozart's music has become pervasive in not just cinema history, but in our broader environment too. I found myself familiar - to varying degrees - with much of the superbly delivered soundtrack. It's all told via a rather apposite ""confession"" between Salieri and a priest who, as the story develops, struggles with his own faith and his belief that all sins can be forgiven. Perhaps some can't? The attention to detail here is fantastic: the sets, costumes and the location photography contribute hugely to the wonderfully rich look and feel of a film that just oozes style and confidence. Hulce's portrayal of the creative virtuoso as he descends into a maelstrom of misery is thoroughly convincing, and by the end - historical fact being adhered to, at least in this - I felt emotionally drained by the strength of these two tours de forces. A big screen with big sound is a must here, and I think you will find the three hours that this lasts will just fly by.",

I have always imagined what a good book would be like with a great soundtrack, and Amadeus gives me that picture.

This sly and subdued court composer is acted wonderfully, showing a figure who is composed on the surface but twisted and bitter on the inside. His aspirations for recognition and success drive him into greater madness to dethrone the irresponsible Mozart who is also portrayed wonderfully.

Murray Abraham, who manages to convey a way of understanding the world that has lost currency today, namely the belief that God controls every little event.

It is equally terrifying as it is hilarious. ""Do you believe in that? Fire, burning you forever after you die?"" ""Oh yes."" That short exchange between Mozart and Salieri, (no matter how inaccurate my quoting of it is, apologies if it is,) is mind-blowingly frightening. I think that this film is for lovers of great music, classical in particular, intellectuals, lovers of great cinema, and even I think, theologians. It is hard to tell, or it is for me at least, weather this film is a direct attack on God, or a fearful thought on his existence. The characters in the film certainly believe in him. Being a Christian myself, these themes were more poignant in my mind, although there are many others, including love, hate, morality, and the value of life. Overall this is an incredibly beautiful, endlessly enjoyable story, which really made me appreciate classical music more than ever before. I recommend this very highly and hope you enjoy and and enjoy thinking about its themes. It certainly left me thinking very hard, with Mozarts music playing in the background of my mind.

Amadeus is beautiful, dramatic and well-built movie. It is not an alternative for ""Lethal Weapon"" or ""Look who is talking now"", other category, other time to see. This movie is to choose if you are in the mood to ""truly see a picture"", not just switch-off. I do advice Amadeus if you want to have a movie-evening with a loved one (and really going for the movie, not something else ;) ). This movie has a great soundtrack, and not just because ""it's Mozart"", but it is been preformed astonishingly, I bought a new sound-system after seeing this film, to watch it again.

This movie is pretty accurate to the real life Mozart. With the extended addition there is a scene with sexual nudity and the word c**t is used. That version is rated R, so watch out if kids are watching that version. If the schools watch it they should stick to the theatrical edition. Even though the theatrical edition is rated PG, it really is more deserving of PG-13. It has sensuality and a lot of drinking. Mozart gets drunk in the movie. Overall it's a great film. Mozart was a great composer and I show big respect and remembrance for him on Memorial day and his birthday. I recommend that kids watch this movie because it gives them a great history lesson. I think they will enjoy it.",

312,23 January 2019,CubsandCulture,10, A great film that is hard to watch,"The plot of this film requires Mozart to be portrayed as boorish, annoying git. Hulce turns in a great turn doing just that. If anything he is too good at being annoying. Pretty much every time Mozart laughs you will want to stab him or your own eardrums. While that is precisely the point of the story it can make the film hard to watch in places. Fortunately the rest of the material is so compelling that you can usually overcome this issue. The film at least is great to think about.",
313,20 September 2005,ww1red_baron,10, Excellent!! But far from depiction of truth,"Amadeus is an excellent movie in every sense of the word.Recreation of Mozart's heavenly music ,great acting performances by F.Murray Abraham & Tom Hulce,excellent costumes...& the list goes on.Viewer's should not be swayed away by the depictions in the movie.Mozart was well versed with compositions of every leading composer of Europe & was not God to create music out of his mind.Depiction of Mozart as an alchol addict and promiscuous are not correct.Moreover Mozart knew how to behave in front of the aristocracy.Antonio Saleiri was a great composer and never actually tried to destroy Mozart.In fact his attempt to suicide was not due to any guilt conscience but possibly due to the shock he received when he heard the news of one of his favorite disciple's untimely demise.However the movie would have been drab and boring if Mozart's biography was depicted.The plot is good and enjoyable.",
314,26 February 2003,tj_director,2, yeah everyone thinks it's a classic but..,"now most classics, i can very well agree with their status, but this one i just can't understand why it's so acclaimed.. critics love bringing down any historical film down to it's artistic licences, but i'm amazed at how this one is so over-missed.. now come on Mozart speaking in an American accent, and most of the cast using contemporary dialogue.. i don't care how great the subject matter or production design is.. but really i can't overlook that fact.. A Knight's Tale having a moment where they sing Queen's 'We Will Rock You' i can enjoy, that film isn't taking itself entirely serious.. but Amadeus is!!! and there cast using american accents and contemporary dialogue in film set in Europe hundereds of years ago, is one of the biggest plot points i could think of.. i just couldn't take the film seriously, and it was pretty boring.",

Mozart travelled to a lot of European cities during this time. His music was a lot more successful than portrayed in the movie. 
The 'paupers' grave was BS. It was common during that time for non-aristocrats to be buried in 'common graves' that were re-used 10 years later. 
The bitter rivalry between Salieri & Mozart, the basis of the movie & that Salieri killed Mozart are BS & most likely come from a Pushkin short story. The movie totally ignores that Mozart became a Freemason 7 years before death & the importance it had it his life.",

Salieri is magnificent; the camera captures every subtle gesture while still taking in the staging of each delightful scene; the story is fascinating, and made only more dramatic by the exquisitely-performed soundtrack, featuring music by Herr Mozart himself and a few other contemporary pieces (played by St Martins-In-The-Fields, it fills three CDs and is worth every penny).",

I really could not think of a more boring topic for a movie than Mozart.  However, this splendid film completely captivated me, holding my attention so well that three hours passed in a virtual flash.  At the end, I felt as drained as the priest in Salieri's room.  Fantastic sets, wonderful casting and superb use of the camera made this possibly the best film I have ever seen. The plot was disturbingly well done- it was almost too painful to watch at times.  Like any really well-done drama, this movie is felt as well as seen.  I even had preordered the LaserDisc, so I could have this must-see gem in my home collection.",

The whole film Salieri was just jealous of Mozart's talent and that's it. It goes a bit deeper with him admiring and respecting Mozart at the same time, but it still for the most part just a film of hatred.",
320,28 December 1999,JBachman,10," ""Well, there it is.""","One of the best films ever made, from the actors to the costumes, to the lighting. To do this film from Salieri's viewpoint was an excellent choice. The soundtrack is excellent, and if you're not a fan of classical music, watching this movie and being able to understand Mozart and what a genius he truly was, you will begin to appreciate classical music, or at least his. Today's artists get paid millions for singing songs that most of them don't even write, yet Mozart composed more than 600 pieces of music in his short 35 years of life, probably earning less than what he was worth. A great movie that never gets dull or boring, I recommend it highly!",
321,27 December 2014,richard-1787,10, Director's Cut - too many words,"I'm not sure why directors are not the best judges of what should be kept and what cut from the final versions of their movies, but the director's cut of this movie, like so many others, shows that they often are not. Perhaps it is because they are too involved in the work to see it objectively? ",
322,28 January 2015,Seraphion,7, A nice depiction of genius,"The movie successfully surprised me with its depiction of Mozart's character and of how he lived his life. But the movie also did very well in depicting the genius of Mozart. I also like how the movie integrate the music into the whole picture, especially on the music writing scene later on. The perspective in the story-telling is also a very nice aspect of this movie. By using Salieri's view of Mozart, the movie nicely confirms the adagio of a hater is indeed a true lover. Especially in this case, the hater is someone who also has quite a talent though not equaling Mozart himself. F. Murray Abraham nicely portray the old Salieri very well, projecting the amazement, hate, guilt and envy all at once. Tom Hulce quite successfully depict his role with the stupid maniacal laughter.",
323,10 May 2006,n-bogdanovic,10, The rise of genius and what comes then,"This may be a major topic for mankind's existential orientation. As soon as something special is recognized it is admired at first. But then someone is disturbed by something lying in the undescribable. Suddenly envy starts to take control. It seems to be the fate of the outstanding persons that they don't have much time left. The mediocres can't endure the outstanding and so they do everything to damage them. It's as Mr. Tyrell says to Roy Batty : ""A candle that burns twice as bright, burns half as long."" And Mozart burned the whole musical universe in his 35 Years. It is important that this film shows Mozart's genius and that his music is still an immortal touch to heaven. I heard that Salieri is underrated as a composer and don't believe that he envied Mozart so much. But to me that's not important. It's a movie (and what a wonderful one). It shows (as Mozart's music) something beyond small-mindedness. A general statement of human psyche. And how the film shows it. Every second is something special. We come to see the heartbreaking downfall of a real gift to mankind and as Salieri is revited to Don Giovanni we have to witness every moment of it. In a sad way it's wonderful. Ah, yes; F. Murray Abraham is brilliant (and got an Oscar, right so), the same with Tom Hulce and the rest of the actors. Here everything is brilliant. I thank Mozart for being the man he was and Milos Forman for what he made of it.",
324,4 December 2014,Movie-ManDan,10, Absolutely Breathtaking!,"As breathtaking as Amadeus is, not everyone will like it. Everybody will agree the acting as a whole, and by Abraham and Hulce alone, are top notch but there are some people that hate opera, can't stand classical music and will laugh too hard at the outfits. Luckily, I am not one of those people. The acting is always the one thing I pay attention to the most, all other film aspects follow soon after. But with this, the sets and costumes are so good, you can't take your eyes off the screen. You are suckered into seeing a cast of fine actors, with two underrated actors named F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce leading the group. Even if people don't like classic or opera, the way that they are placed in this is sure to blow the viewer away. There is one scene where Salieri (Abraham) plays a fine composition then gives Mozart (Hulce) to critique. Mozart likes it, but makes it even a better piece in an instant. No matter the viewer, they will find that bit really cool.",

It may or may not be historically accurate but it is an amazing story nonetheless. I am not familiar with the rest of the 2 main actors' careers but I am willing to bet they never came close again to the magnificent performance they give here.
As a note, I am also willing to bet that if this movie was made now, everyone would have some sort of silly fake British accent. I don't know why this is the trend these days and this movie clearly shows how unnecessary it it.",

It's the very rare modern day film, with all the trappings of today's film debauchery (language, sex, violence, etc.) that could just as easily have been produced back in the golden age of Hollywood (pre-1950.) F. Murray Abraham's portrayal of Salieri is truly Oscar award worthy. What better way to teach history than to show it through the eyes of the third person in which every step of the title character's role is seen with enough detail as to not confine the character within the facts of histories already known. Yes, as within most Hollywood's rendering of history, there are surely many facts that have been left to the director/screenwriter's interpretation, but then again - this is entertainment, not education.",

It's so opulent and detailed it's like bathing in a giant Fabergé egg. The core focus of the drama, although only lightly real, is what pushes the whole beast forward and it has fantastic momentum which still feels vital even as (the slightly bloated director's cut, this is) rolls into hour number two. All hands (or should that be hams) play it with edible vigour and Abraham particularly has a fantastic time chewing on Salieri's tormented angst. A mesmerising work, and worth a gander.",

Murray Abraham), a man who only wanted to perform music for the joy of it, and to garner critical recognition for his work. Intertwining with Salieri's life, however, is the vulgar, arrogant and vain Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (portrayed by Tom Hulce), in which lies an amazing musical genius beyond comprehension.",

What really bothered me the most was seeing Mozart, a truly self-centered bastard, go bonkers and not care that his wife and baby were starving to death. His wife had to beg for food from strangers because her husband was such a self-absorbed jerk. If this actually happened, then Mozart was very narcissistic and probably bi-polar, too. I'm tired of movies about crazy, self-centered geniuses. Too painful to watch. We were supposed to enjoy his kooky, wacky personality and crazy behavior, but I felt sorry for his wife, who was forced to suffer from his insanity.",

The story is such a fascinating one and it was truly engaging and informative for me because I knew so little about the subject matter and the movie really made use of its themes and setting creating an enriching world and wonderful characters Due to incredible attention to detail, wonderful interior and costume design, fantastic and informative story, truly powerful finale and a remarkable performance from F. Murray Abraham, Amadeus is truly a special movie and although it has many drawn out sequences mainly with musical pieces and opera performances, it is otherwise a remarkable film that benefits from terrific character development and a wonderful exploration of some truly amazing themes and relationships.

339,18 April 2002,Sean_Thorniley,10, Exquisite journey into two tormented souls,"The directors cut of Amadeus is far better than I initially anticipated.  I knew I would find it satisfying since it's one of my top 20 films of all time, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was significantly better.  Much like the directors cuts of The Abyss, or more appropriately, Touch of Evil's ""restored"" edition the film has a clearer story and smoother pace with a tighter climax.  It is too bad that many studios and/or producers feel the need to shorten films for fear of the audience being lost and/or bored.  One would think that with the success of so many ""long"" films even since the early days of the medium the industry would have learned that folks do not mind a well done story even if it is long no matter the medium. 	Anyway, I had not seen this film on the Big Screen since its initial release and not on video for  many years so it was wonderful to see it as it was meant to be viewed.  The print was of above average quality for one that had made the rounds for sometime which was also wonderful since it let the fabulous sound resound and stir the passions of  the film as it was designed.  The power of the music and the imagery was nearly breathtaking (it was a small screen with a slightly aging sound system where I watched it) and more powerful than I remember as a senior in high school. 	My favorite aspects of the film however are still a toss up between the score and the performances of Abrahms and Hulce, exquisite it the only word that comes close.  The costumes and set where of course first rate and helped create the mood without over powering it and I found that the cinematography was more interesting and subtle than I remember.  The script was witty with just a few dashes of charm which accentuated the horror and sadness wonderfully, like your favorite meal, or piece of music!  It is still wonderful to delve into the depths of tormented soul as this film does so perfectly. 	See this film again, especially if you have yet to see this cut!",

If that's not enough, it mocks pretension by using Antonio Salieri. He's just so insufferably envious of Mozart, that he inadvertently kills him. Even after death, he can't get over how inferior he is to the master. What a great antihero. A jerk to end all jerks. Adding to the ridicule that makes Amadeus so unique, is Mozart himself. Without prior knowledge, you'd leave the film thinking that this whole time, he was an idiot savant. But perhaps, Mozart is just as colorful as his punk rock wigs... at least that would be what we all would hope for.

But what exactly makes this film so special to not only me, but to so many film buffs and critics alike?

This achievement is primarily brought by the carefully selected background music connects perfectly with the movies from scene to scene, but most importantly, all the background music are Mozart's compositions, and through this movie we celebrate Mozart as a great composer who can transfer his feelings not by language, but by music. And it is a guarantee that by the end of the movie, you will be so completely absorbed into this movie that you will forget to take the DVD out until the cast list is over.

Amadeus is a curious movie, for a multiple oscar winner its rarely mentioned among peoples 'top lists'. Stanger still is the fact that its leading actors F.

I love Mozart, and I also love this film. It never shows Salieri killing Mozart, in fact it never even shows Salieri as the Man in Black, it shows Salieri's reaction to Mozart and God. People blame this for bad feeling against Salieri, but that's simply not true. Salieri was a dead name until this film came about. People aren't stupid enough to think Salieri actually killed Mozart. I cannot understand anyone not liking this film. It's beautifully crafted, written and acted. It's a bit of historical fiction, and revived interest in Mozart. I love this film. I could go on, but I won't. W. A. Mozart is one of my favorite people of all time, and this film shows him in a very human way. They do not portray him as an untouchable genius, but as they very real man he was.   As an aspiring Mozart scholar I would know that this is not a very accurate film. But so what? It's beautiful, touching, and makes me cry every time I see it.   If you enjoy classical music, go see this film. If you enjoy good movies, go rent this.

""Amadeus"" tells the story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in a series of flashbacks told by the now insane rival composer Salieri (Abraham). As the story begins, we see that Salieri is now troubled by his past and in complete hostility towards Mozart, who was a far more talented musician than Salieri. In an attempt to ridicule Mozart, Salieri finds his music overwhelmingly beautiful and ironically inspirational, bringing out an even stronger rage towards the legend.",

As for the story, I thought it was an interesting telling of this one sided 'rivalry' between two composers. It seems that I am the only one who actually liked Tom Hulce performance as Mozart himself. My guess is many folks perhaps thought such a musical genius should have been played with for reverence and seriousness? Not sure, but like all geniousnesses, I'm sure Mozart was also just a tad crazy and eccentric, of which I think Hulce portrayed with affectation. Overall, Amadeus is definitely worth checking out.",
354,19 May 2009,lifetimejuli,9, Jealousy of the musical notes,"This drama film "" Amadeus"" is beautifully made, when it comes to costumes, huge wigs and the music. I had nothing more to say than ""WOW!"". Mozart's life is presented in such a dramatic, interesting way, that it makes one hunger for knowing more and more of this genius musician life. But the movie is not a mirror image of his life. When I read his biography I got to the conclusion that the movie is much more entertaining. The film presents Mozart with a playful, weird kind of funny laugh and the personality of a child with a lack of manners that cares greatly about his music. He married and had a child in the movie, but actually, he was a father of four in real life. One of my favorite performance on the movie is the one done by Abroham in the role of Salieri, this strange and obscure actor really does a great job when it comes to explaining his feeling of jealousy and his plan of vengeance against God for denying him the talent that Mozart possess. Salieri always asked God to make of him the greatest musician because of his love for music. But, God denied him that talent and gave it to Mozart. Consequently, Salieri created a plan to steal Mozart work and finish with his life. In the other hand, the film present Tom Hulce in the role of Mozart, a character of poor, immature personality, not much of a talker for being the principal character. He will keep one entertained with his comical laughs, sharp movement during the operas presentation, and finally the deterioration of his health and weaken of his character through the films. Over all, The Producers of these films made the films much more entertaining for the audience by taking you back in time with the elaborate costumes, fashionable wigs, Mozart 's music, and the humorous scenes performed by Wolfy. Definitely, a movie to watch.",
355,19 May 2009,krcoe,9, A Genius in Music,This film 'Amadeus' was not all about Mozart. It is actually about Salieri and his obsession with the great composer. But why this film is called 'Amadeus'? In fact the word Amadeus in Latin means 'Loved by God' which is Mozart's middle name. It is a perfect title because Mozart has so much talent that one would believe that he is loved by God so much.,
356,25 February 2003,SlicerX,10," Apart from the great script, acting, costumes there is the greatest music of all time.","Look, I will make this simple. It is probably the best acted film I have ever seen especially by Abraham F Murray. I think the script is incredible, although it really has nothing to do with the real life of Mozart. The music is by the greatest of all composers, Mozart, so to say that the score is the best is an understatement.",

If he was like that, I hate him and people like that, it's as if they haven't lived a single day in their lives.  This movie is a bad movie because of the music, which gets on my nerves.  The directing isn't great and the storyline is boring.  There is no inspiration, no acting and the way Mozart dies is pathetic.  The guy makes him think too much and his dumbass brain works too much?  That's what he gets.  Mozart is no hero, you want a heroic movie.  That's Scarface and Braveheart.",

Among other things Mozart carried a horrible attitude toward anyone who tried to counsel him. He was very immature, and irresponsible in a number of ways. He had many adoring fans but the fame and attention goes straight to his head. Not even the kind words of his lovely wife could take him off of his high horse.",

363,27 February 2008,Spinetinglers,10, Mediocrity vs. Genius,"Everyone in their life will encounter someone who is brilliant at doing something. Pangs of jealously will ensue, and we will examine their behaviour, probably thinking to ourselves that they do not deserve to have this great gift, that they do not deserve to have a talent that we lack. All through life, all through history, the talentless have always been jealous of the talented. The fact that we are not created equal and some of us will have to work very hard at things that come so easily to others is the theme that runs through Amadeus  Salieri is so jealous of Mozart's talent that he conspires to let as few people as possible hear Mozart's music, and ultimately tries to kill him by sending him mad.",
364,13 December 2003,charlconradie,10, Monumental masterpiece,"The first time I saw Amadeus, I was 13 years old. Although I always loved classic music I thought it was the dullest, longest film ever made. The only memorable line at that time being ""...people so lofty they sound as though they s*** marble!"" When I was 17 I saw it again and the mastery of the complete work slowly dawned upon me. I am now 29 and watch this film at least once per annum and there is always something fresh, witty and intriguing that I had missed on previous viewings. (Often when people ask how can you keep on watching the same film over and over, my answer is: why do you buy a painting?) The acting of F. Murray Abraham is indeed worthy of an Oscar. It is strange that he never again reached this acting peak in the subsequent years of his career. In the scene where (as an old man in the asylum) he narrates his fantasy of his intended murder of Mozart and the ensuing, beautiful funeral (...Mozart's LITTLE coffin, while from the choir the most heavenly music - composed by his dear friend, Antonio Salieri! Ssss...!!) I ask myself if better acting has ever been filmed. Also the music used in this film is masterfully selected an played by St Martin in the Fields. When 4 Mozart experts were asked to recommend a conductor for this project; the choice was made easy when all 4 wrote on their slips of paper: Neville Marriner. A film which is truly worthy of the clichés ""unforgettable"", ""masterpiece"" and ""monumental"". This film is not an accurate description of the Mozart-Salieri affair; but never claimed to be.

Any and all people interested in the craft, whether as an actor themselves or as a spectator, should see this film for both F. Murray Abraham's beautifully tragic Salieri and Tom Hulce's fascinating Mozart. Both give their all with these roles and it SHOWS. In addition to the brilliant acting, the movie sports a fantastic script that prods deeply into one of the great fears of any artist: fear of mediocrity, of possessing the desire to express one's self but not the talent.

Although there is some facts that they didn't happen in real life and Mozart wasn't too ""crazy"", I think the picture shows the genius behind ""the vulgar man"" as he called himself. That scenes when he writes his music are simply magnificent. The music inside his mind and he just writes it. Then how he is describing his own music. By the other side, there is no shown any pupil working with him. I know that wasn't the purpose of the director (Milos Forman), but it would be interesting at least if one of his pupils had appeared.

The script is completely at fault: it is incoherent and contains a really disappointing ending. How it ever won an Oscar, I will never know.",
386,6 June 2020,dr_clarke_2,10, Entirely deserving of its reputation,"Milos Forman was reportedly cautious about the prospects of his 1984 film Amadeus, suspecting that a two-hour and forty-minute movie about classical music might not find a wide audience. So he probably wasn't expecting that it would win eight Academy Awards (including Best Picture), four BAFTAs, four Golden Globes and more, as well as frequently appearing on lists of the greatest films ever made ever since. Nevertheless, it isn't hard to see it received so many accolades.
Amadeus is a biography of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, focalised through this rival composer Antonio Salieri. Much of the story - including the Mozart-Salieri rivalry - is pure fiction, but then the film - with a screenplay by Peter Shaffer adapted from his own play - isn't intended to be a documentary. The film charts Mozart's life from child prodigy right up until his death; Salieri's animosity towards him - which Mozart remains oblivious too - drives the plot. Salieri goes from admiring Mozart to wanting to emulate him, to hating him and becoming resentful about his failure to achieve the same level of success. The dignified hardworking Salieri is disillusioned early on, as he meets his musical hero who turns out to a ""giggling, dirty-minded creature""; his faith and his ego fuel his hatred, since he believes that Mozar's music is literally divine and resents the fact that Salieri wasn't God's chosen instrument instead.
The acting is astonishing. F. Murray Abraham inhabits the role of Salieri naturalistically, showing a great deal about the man is thinking through facial expressions and body language alone. A noteworthy example comes during the scene in which Salieri reads Mozart's music and realises that - without any corrections at all - his fellow composer has simply written down music already fully composed in his head. Salieri narrates the film from the framing sequence that sees the elderly composer - having tried to cut his own throat - languishing in a sanatorium, confessing his sins to a priest, and Abraham is just as convincing as the much older Salieri, with help from some quite remarkable make-up.
Abraham is arguably the star, but Tom Hulce's childish Mozart with his high-pitched giggle and tantrums is a revelation. Hulce is painfully believable as Mozart's sanity starts to deteriorate as he struggles to complete his ""Requiem Mass"" following his father's death. Shaffer's characterisation of Mozart as an enfant terrible with father issues and an lack of respect for authority that often undermines his career is highly effective and Hulce is pitch-perfect. There's a not a single actor out of place here: Jeffrey Jones is surprisingly imperial as Joseph II, whilst the likes of Charles Kay as Count Orsini-Rosenberg give wholly convincing performances. Elizabeth Berridge is very naturalistic as Constanze Mozart, willing to sleep with Salieri to advance her husband's career despite her otherwise unshakeable loyalty, whilst Roy Dotrice impresses as Mozart's patrician father Leopold.
Forman's direction means that everything works here: the sumptuous production design that is evident in the immaculate mise-en-scene, Miroslav Ondrícek's cinematography, and the careful editing by Nena Danevic and Michael Chandler. The Prague location filming is gorgeous and the soundtrack - consisting entirely of works by Mozart - is not just appropriate but carefully assembled so that each piece suits its scene. The staging of the operas within the film is an impressive achievement in its own right.
Amadeus is arguably Forman's masterpiece (although it vies with One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for that title) and remains a magisterial film: it deserved its many accolades at the time, and unlike some award winning films it has retained its power to entertain and to inspire awe. It is likely that it will continue to appear on lists of great films for many years to come.",
387,27 October 2000,blur13,9, How is this movie so good?,"For a movie that is based on a storyline that is - to put it mildly - an outrageous lie, Amadeus is still an enjoyable tale from start to finish. Even the presence of American accents (most notably, Mozarts wife) roaming the corridors of 18th century European nobility doesn't detract greatly from the experience. Yes, it's that good. Immerse yourself in the music and try not to take the storyline too seriously.",

Two characterisations of the creative spirit. Salieris are far more common than mozarts, but art can't survive on mozarts or salieris alone.

Basically, the fictionalized story of a rivalry between Mozart and Salieri, leading to Mozart's tragic death. The acting was great across the board, which is surprising considering how few of these names were big actors (either then or now). Using old Salieri's narration to pace and frame the story is another great too - it sort of divides the story into manageable chunks, and is a big reason why the movie goes by so fast. The music... What is there to say. It's Mozart. It's all mozart. I don't think it's possible to walk away from this movie without immediately listening to more of his and other classical tracks. The great thing is how well they incorporate the different instruments and pieces into the film; they don't just play the pieces, they show you how the characters (especially Salieri) are 'feeling' the music. There were one or two scenes that made me like Salieri less or got annoying. What I found out later was that these scenes weren't in the theatrical cut (only the director's cut that I watched).

Ever since, Mozart and his music, as well as many other classical composers, have been important in my life. As well as this movie! I dare easily say that this is one of the best movies ever made: the setting, combined with these actors, this direction and of course this music have made this movie a classic. 10/10!",

Only when he saw Peter Shaffer's play, a highly fictionalized account of the rivalry of Mozart and the Viennese court composer Antonio Salieri, he immediately understood its potential - and turned it into a masterpiece.

We can empathize to a certain extent with Salieri, but pity him as much for his own lack of understanding of his own talent and his obsessive jealousy.

419,14 January 2017,cdjh-81125,8, Anything But Mediocrity,"Milos Formans, ""Amadeus"" is a film that for me could have had the potential to be either a fascinating insight into how a pointless rivalry destroyed the lives of two good men or an overlong bore that failed to intrigue me as I have got literally zero interest in music but I found that this film fell into the former category and found it to be fantastic. This film doesn't really have one good character to get behind, everyone has hopes and loses that you all feel, everyone is flawed and down to earth, I found myself never being able to ultimately pick one side in the film. Both characters are developed perfectly You understand just how much their music means to both of them and why they need to hold on to it, it gives a fantastic insight into there mind sets and makes them more investing as well as interesting characters. Every thing in this film production wise is fantastic all the eccentric costumes, palaces and gutters look perfect. F Murray Abraham won an Academy Award for his performance in this film and I've seen few performances more deserving he is so convincing as a conflicted man shamed with his inability to advance beyond mediocrity, he's perfect at balancing both the young idealistic and older fragile versions of his character, he always had me engaged and he was truly amazing in this movie. Tom Hulce who I have seen literally nothing else from is fantastic in this movie, he's over the top laugh, excitable tendencies yet committed nature made him an entertaining character to watch and was the perfect opposition for Abraham. It's also a very dark film to watch at times, the way in which these two men's lives begin to fall apart isn't truly heartbreaking as ,like is said, they are developed perfectly so you understand the stakes of their rivalry. But I loved that they didn't necessarily hate each other but were really jealous of each other and their eventual bond towards the end of the film made for an extremely satisfying conclusion to their arc. One of my only real issues with this movie is the love story between Mozart and his wife, it gets extremely repetitive and dull after a while and his wife was completely unlikable to I ultimately just ended up not caring at anything of her turmoil. Another issue was the present day story line with the mental asylum it was mainly he Actor who played the priest who gave a fairly bad performance, just relying on the same facial expressions to carry his portrayal and got on my nerves after a while.

Perhaps the greatest aspect involves the editing.  None of Mozart's music is changed or revised in any way from the original.  All the editing of the film was structured around maintaining that consistency.  F. Murray Abraham's performance was one of the best of his career.

Unlike allot of films made in the last 20 years, this was actually a brilliant adaptation from the original play.  Tom Hulce was a bit of an odd choice as Mozart, (his accent slipping a bit) but he was still very convincing as Mozart.

Only a handful of his work had ever been performed in his lifetime. He did die impoverished, he did have a pauper's funeral in a common pauper's grave. He was a vulgar person, given to scatological humor, he was given to drink--and for a small person, alcohol would be more disastrous than for a larger person. (These details are well documented.)",

429,20 July 2003,silvercloud9,5, nice try,"I honestly cannot fathom the enduring popularity of this film.  It is over-produced, garish and vulgar, directed with a ham-fist by Milos Forman...and would appear to be only incidentally about Mozart's music.  I know, I know, the point is that hapless, buffoonish Mozart was also, ironically, a prolific and endlessly inventive fountain of matchlessly elegant, mostly joyous and altogether perfect music (though emphatically and unfortunately not the politically astute schemer that the plodding, envious and sinister Salieri was).  However interesting the conception of this film undeniably is as a dramatic device, would not an important additional point of a biographical picture about the life and times of a composer be to attempt to somehow relate that life to the creation of his music?  I don't imagine that this relationship was quite as arbitrary and incidental as it is presented here; the music itself, and its connection with Mozart's life and soul, is given pretty short shrift, in my opinion, and is not in fact a subject at all.  The screen  is instead filled to bursting, like an over-stuffed sofa, with broad cartoonish performances, frantic cutting, goggle-eyed camera work, and hideous wigs and make-up that attempt unsuccessfully to present a highly stylised re-creation of the Eighteenth Century.  Where in all of this indigestible and copious display is the soul and spirit of Mozart's matchless elegance, lightness and clarity, which was in many ways the definitive musical expression of the soul and spirit of the Eighteenth Century itself?  Not anywhere apparent that I can detect.  If you, as a filmgoer, want to experience a magically evocative and completely realised  stylisation of the 18th C. I suggest you view ""Fellini's Casanova"" (and ignore the dubbing and stilted performances).  And if you want to see a brilliantly expressive and gorgeous film about a Great Composer (Beethoven), and his times, his soul and his music, and his enigmatic life as an artist, then seek out, and savor, ""Immortal Beloved""(1994).  A magnificent film, and everything that busy, noisy tedious and empty ""Amadeus"" is not.  Sorry, but ""Amadeus"" stinks.",

It helps that F Murray Abraham is just phenomenal, and 100% deserved his Oscar. Even though Salieri does awful things, we still understand why he did what he did, and it makes the story a lot more grounded and engaging. Mozart is clearly a flawed character, but like Salieri the film presented him in a very human way, making it easier to connect with him. This makes the runtime feel a lot more acceptable as I actually cared about what happened to the characters. The cinematography is fantastic, but I have to praise the score. Obviously the opera pieces are impressive, but also the actual music played during normal scenes is just brilliantly done, and gave the whole film a sense of grandeur. The story has to be good to keep me engaged for so long, and whilst it's built on a fairly simple premise it really did manage to keep me engaged. The set design is another great feature, and it helped immerse me in this era. My only issue is that it didn't flashback to Salieri as an older man enough, particularly towards the end of the film. It was such an interesting aspect to the movie, and I would have liked it to have been explored further. I am just nitpicking, but that's the only reason why this masterpiece isn't quite a 10/10.

While at the same time it demonstrates jealousy and greed on the other end of the spectrum. Milos Foreman is unique and creative in the way he brings the story of Wolfgang A. Mozart to the screen. Mozart in the movie is portrayed as this naive but celestial sent prodigy. Whose genius is sometimes out shadowed by his pranks, and ""infintile boy"" behavior. But do not think that his music is comic, it is anything but that! In his music and in the film is portrayed with such seriousness, grandeur, and humility that it was quite the opposite of Mozart himself. Saleri is methodical in his story explaining by a confessional account of how he loved and hated Mozart. But most of all, the music is beyond imagination, each segment in the movie shows and tells how Mozart develops these mercurial and mysterious pieces that capitulates us how he truly was a genius at his work. All the actors did an incredible job in portraying the people that were more or less in Mozart's life. To see this movie is a must, it will move you and make you laugh at the same time. But it will not make you laugh at the person portrayed in the movie, rather, it will make you appreciate how much he loved to live life and expressing it with music. Mozart's music in one way is a celebration of life; love, joy, hate, jealousy, immortality, death, and forgiveness. The list is not exhaustive but it does portray the inner subconscious feelings that we practice everyday. This movie explains this and it does with such accuracy that in Mozart's words are perfect, no more no less than I require! This movie will go down as timeless and sublime in movie history.

This movie brought the spectacular music of both Mozart and Salieri. This tale was talented. It started out as old Antonio telling of the life of Mozart while in an asylum. It was a tale of pure talented and jealousy ending in tragedy.

The majority of the scenes are on the comic side, but those dramatic ones aren't missing. Wolfie (Tom Hulce), like his wife Costanze (Elizabeth Berridge) called him, is that childish mastermind, who modesty doesn't apply to throughout all the movie, yet it gives you joy watching him perform. Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) on the other hand is portrayed in two personas: young and old. They're quite different from each other. The young one is his position as a court composer for the emperor (Jeffrey Jones), and his old one is that of the narrator of the story. The emperor, now that I mentioned it, is a pulled-back, not-so-obvious character and his performance is hilarious, in my view. What's really about this movie that shouldn't be missed are the operas.

F.Murray Abraham portrays the religious and sceptical Italian composer Antonio Salieri , who does nothing to hide his jealousy for the former child prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). Salieri's bitterness towards Mozart yet his unwavering admiration for his talent cause Salieri to question his own faith, believing God to be mocking him for his own mediocrity. It's this developing rivalry that keeps viewers entertained throughout the film as Mozart grapples with alcoholism, his father's death, writing the Magic Flute and his crippling financial situation. We are constantly led to believe that it is Salieri who is such a negative influence on Mozart, eventually leading yo the composers unexplained death at the age of 35. He was writing the Requiem at the time of his death and it is shown that Salieri finishes it for him. The film then ends leaving us to ponder over whether it was Salieri who killed Mozart or if it was God who reclaimed his ""Beloved"", in reference to the Italian meaning of the film's title.

Actually, there was once a rumor that it was Saliery who killed Mozart out of envy. However, this was proved to be false later and the film also depicts the same. Presented as a flashback narration by an aged Saliery, this movie follows his point of view. Saliery, the court composer in the royal court of Vienna. He lived a happy life until one day the king invites Mozart to his court. Once there, Saliery sees Mozart as the 'Creature', who is hopelessly careless, obnoxious, easy going and socially ignorant person. However, his talents are prodigal and effortlessly creating divinely beautiful music is natural for him. Due to this, Saliery feels great envy as well as admiration for him. However, even after being immensely gifted, Mozart fails as a son, husband and professional due to his impractical ways. e slips in to poverty, falls prey to illness, dies and is buried as an insignificant commoner. Saliery, out of pity and admiration stays with him at the end and drafts Mozart's final composition on his dictation. The execution of this film is lovely and gives an accurate feel.

The obvious American accents of Tom Hulce (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) and Elizabeth Berridge (his wife Constanze) are somewhat misplaced in the setting of 18th century Vienna as is the use of 'mom' and some swearing which seem a bit juxtaposed with what is otherwise a stunning recreation of the period. It could also be argued that German and Italian would have seemed more authentic and appropriate for the language but if one can get over these small quibbles, then overall this is a very entertaining movie with some brilliant performances from the two male leads.

F.Murray Abraham is excellent as Antonio salieri. You can truly understand how jealous he feels towards Mozart. Basically, Salieri is the top composer in vienna, but when Mozart comes along, he feels angry that Mozart has a much better gift for music than he. Salieri is then determined to destroy Mozart. The music used for the movie also plays a big part. There is also a lot to do with god as well. Salieri is angry at god for blessing Mozart(who is very big-headed and annoying) with such devine gifts that he so desperately wants for himself. Even though Salieri may sound like a bad person, you actually feel sorry for him. When he first meets Mozart, he tries his best to welcome him by writing a piece of music for him, but Mozart, not exactly meaning to, sort of critices Salieri's music for being repetitive, so makes his own changes to it.",

Sometimes an exceptional movie becomes suffocated by its own quality and therefore loses entertainment value as the director struggles to strike balance between fun and artistic. Amadeus is the perfect example of how a work of art can be gripping, funny, elevated, educational, emotional and easy to watch without losing any of its artistic merit along the way. F Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce's duelling composers Salieri and Mozart are perfectly cast to show off the childishness and bitterness of one exceptional and one mediocre composer and Mozart's music interwoven into the score and taking centre stage is nothing short of magestic.

The movie mainly follows Salieri attempts to first befriend Mozart, then try to become better Mozart and then finally trying to destruct Mozart - all in the name of love of Mozarts magic. The movie also explores Mozarts relationship with his father Leopold, and how through his death, Salieri uses it to his advantage. Yes, the movie is about Mozart - but it is also a movie about falling from grace. Highly Recommended.",

482,19 May 2009,Cmagilewski,10, Amadeus' Music & Mysterious Life,"Amadeus was a precise and basic film that portrayed Mozart's life. The film overall was a historical view on Mozart's music and also personnel life. It had a remarkably outstanding cast as well as the setting and costumes. The film accurately showed what Mozart's life was about and how his music was truly genius. However, the story involved not just Mozart, but also his family, friends, and colleagues which gave a vast outlook and opinion about his life. The story was told from Antonio Salieri's (F. Murray Abraham), who told the story from what he felt or believed. The story gave flashbacks from Salieri's point of view on Mozart. This could be inaccurate due to Salieri's feelings or bias toward Mozart. Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) played an extraordinary role as a frail and silly musician. His characterization and role proved to be extremely realistic. His facial gestures, movement, and humor contributed tremendously to the film. Amadeus had many speculations concerning if Mozart was really the way he was as the film. Or if Mozart and his father really had a close relationship. It is very difficult to tell, yet the film had a phenomenal way of portraying an idea of what it could really have been. The environment and atmosphere made the film to become very credible. The costumes and makeup/hair design was very traditional to the people of that colonial era. Amadeus is a very moving film that clearly illustrates the dramatic life of Mozart. This film is an inspiring and breathtaking work of art that has won eight Oscars and many other awards. In recognition of its terrific performance, Amadeus has become one of the most original movies of all time. It has wonderful twist with different characterizations that make it an impeccable five –star movie!",
483,22 February 2011,dmenfield,10," Best of class, and worthy","It should be noted that the playwright Peter Shaffer titled Amadeus a ""fantasy"". In fact, it is just that. It becomes a Man vs. God morality play, where in order to make the dialectic work, Salieri must be portrayed as an admirable person, and Mozart as a cretin, albeit a genius. That is the fantasy. Nothing we know about either Salieri or Mozart supports such characterizations, other than Mozart's undeniable genius. In fact, once past his striking normality (so much for the theory that madness and genius always walkhand-in-hand), we know that Mozart was a clear eyed judge of musical worth, and one of the best friends one could ever have). Moreover, we know this: Mozart was probably the greatest musical genius that ever lived, and Salieri was a routine 18th Century musician chiefly known through Pushkin's play and Rimsky-Korsakov's opera as the man who poisoned Mozart (a contention generally dismissed as false).",

Amadeus presents stunning performance blending with an unfamiliar tale of the genius musical mind,  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. I find myself lucky that I got insight about the life of Mozart, his great story and how he gave shape and definition to his music. I think the power of film comes from the creativity of the director. Other than presenting an ordinary story, Amadeus is told from the point of view of his rival, Antonio Salieri. Thanks to Forman, this view made Amadeus fascinating and unforgettable. In the film, we see two greatly complex and conflicted men (Mozart and Salieri) as they compete directly and indirectly for recognition and appreciation. Of course we should not ignore outstanding performance of F. Murray Abraham who got both the Oscar in Best Actor and Golden Globe in Best Performance Awards in 1985 for his performance in Amadeus. With one sentence, Amadeus is a true masterpiece and a must-see for anyone!",

486,20 November 2011,msbloch,10, Amadeus -- Genius unleashed,"Okay, ""Equus"" (by Peter Shaffer) is clever and original but a little far out. But Shaffer's ""Amadeus"" raises the ante by adding enveloping universal themes in a compelling dialog deserving of its Best Picture Academy Award. Who could not be moved by Salieri, the court composer, who initially promises to devote himself and his music to God. Only to realize that he is and will only be ""mediocre."" He is merely blessed ""with an ear"", and the knowledge, to recognize the pure beauty of the work of the silly and vulgar Mozart. As Salieri's devotion morphs into a battle against God and His instrument, Mozart, and as Salieri's schemes succeed and fail by chance and design, the twisting of Salieri's mind is depicted with the painful whisperings and gestures of hands and face (of Murray Abraham) in a way rarely seen on the screen. Iago (from Shakespeare's Othello) has nothing on Salieri. Except that Salieri has fallen and knows it and seeks absolution. As you leave the theater, you may ask why health, success, and happiness comes so effortlessly to the wicked and why the righteous are often overlooked. Or you may ask why Salieri did not simply embrace and foster the beauty in his midst. Or ask why Salieri was not satisfied with the bounty of his life. Most of us are content to hear ""the duet change into a trio into a quartet into a quintet into a sextet with more complex harmonies"" without reviling the composer. But Salieri reveals our darkside that sees another's perfect dive, perfect pass, perfect statement, or perfect notes that prompt ""why not me?"" Of course, the meaning of ""Amadeus"" -- ""God's love"" -- is not lost on the viewer and only contributes to the 10 of 10 rating the movie deserves. Kudos to Shaffer, Milos Forman (director), F.M. Abraham, Tim Hulce (who moves way beyond ""Animal House"" here to create the mathematically musical facility and obnoxiousness of Mozart), and the lighting and musical contributors in fitting the puzzle pieces together so nicely.",

Yes, the pacing, editing and photography are top notch. Yes, the writing is, for the most part, brilliant. ""Amadeus"" would have been a great film as a character study of a fictitious composer loosely based on Mozart's life. Subtract out the silly nonsense, add a little depth and nuance to the character, and you would have an excellent character study dichotomizing two very different types of artists. Friends, yet competitors. One supremely gifted but erratic and eccentric. One highly skilled but perhaps jaded and not so inspired. There are many different, more compelling ways a film like this could have developed if it had been based on a purely fictitious character (which it basically is anyway) and had a story a bit more grounded and believable. If you're going to attempt a historic bio, at least make a minimal effort to be accurate. ""Amadeus"" may as well have been directed by Oliver Stone as outlandish as it is. For a real bio, read Maynard Solomon's ""Mozart."" He forever destroys the eternal child myth presented here.

It's interesting that they portray Mozart, a world-famous composer whose name has gone down in history, as a dirty-minded, infantile clown.

I just wish that I could get a copy of the last composition he was working on with Salieri when he died. That piece must be beautiful. Reqiuem for the Dead. Mozart was a womanizer as well as a drunk but he composed his best music when he was drunk. His wife had many men that she slept with when Mozart was away at the opera or the playhouse of the time.

The characters have about as much depth as those found in Coen brothers' films; the whole Mozart-Salieri is nearly totally fictional; the sordid, soap-operish (no pun intended) relationships between virtually every character are pure Hollywood pap but most importantly (and offensively), there is NO historical basis on which to portray Mozart as an over-sexed, philandering drunkard who took nothing seriously other than his own fame. Yes, I know a couple of pornographic-songs-as-bad-jokes were found in Mozart's notebooks but, beyond that, all evidence points to the fact ol' Wolfgang was ever the faithful husband (not to mention a deeply devout Christian, as well). And where did the writer come up with this idea that Mozart hated and was rebelling against Italian opera? If it weren't so prominent in the film I wouldn't take issue with it but, once again, it is completely historically inaccurate. Mozart idolized and emulated Italian opera composers and his sense of melody is equally rooted in that genre as in the German masters of his youth. In other words, the Mozart in the movie isn't even a caricature but, rather, a complete invention. Historic bone-picking aside, even if this tale were completely fictional and there was no historical figure called ""Mozart"", the movie is just awful. The corny make-up of the aging Salieri, the acting of virtually every character other than Tom Hulce's Wolfie (which is not to contradict myself, it is admittedly a good performance), the cardboard cut-out characters and melodramatic direction all add up to create a near total artistic failure.",

As a movie experience, it is entertaining and rewarding at the same time. Considering that Milos Forman was at the helm of its creation, one has a lot of expectations of the film and believe me they are well founded. He fills the movie with such grandeur and depth that you are easily overwhelmed. The length of the movie could scare the most avid movie buff, but frankly i didn't find it a drag. And in case you find yourself wondering if you'd like it despite the fact that you don't know the first thing about Mozart or his music, the answer is an emphatic no.",
515,7 July 2022,tiantianmk,8, A revenge to God from a great man,"After watching this film, a respect for Salieri lingered in my head. He was never a mediocrity, like he stated at the end, but rather he was also a genius at his time. He was a complex and deep person with a profound love for his religion, music and life. Compared to him, Mozart is, although genius in music, a less interesting character. Salieri's conduct was not a result from jealousy, because if so, there are also other people better than him in many other ways who he never felt anything about. He was born from an inferior class and fought his way through his position, so there must have been many more who were better than him but he never cared. He was driven by his vengeance to God, because he thought God denied him as his kid, abandoned him, and teased him. He was religiously in love with music, but God gave the talent to another person who got what he wanted from almost everything - the court he served now loved Mozart, his beloved girl gave herself to Mozart, the position he wanted was referred to Mozart...He wanted to revenge to God for being such a jerk to him (pardon my language), that was why he decided to humiliated Stanze the night he threw God's statue into fire. But he was, at the same time, so in love with music, that he couldn't concentrate on his revenge. He couldn't help but got into ecstasy every time he listened to Mozart's music. He couldn't resist his compliment to Mozart whenever the latter came to him for opinion. At last, he even wanted to help Mozart to finish his last piece of work. He served at him like an assistant, he got so excited when he understood what Mozart wanted to express through every phrase. He totally forgot everything when he was in the world of music. He was actually the one who understood Mozart the most at their time, which made him at least one of the greatest music critics. Mozart in this film was also fighting with a feeling, which was his intimidation and obedience to his father. He, compared to Salieri, never got to choose what he wanted to do for his life. Although he was lucky that his father chose him the way he could fulfill his talent, but that was out of his obedience to another person. Thus he was always living under a dark cloud, which drove him into excessive drinking and partying, for that was an easy way to forget about that cloud. Besides music, I also feel Salieri great as shown in his taste of food. He understood beauty in life, and chew every bite of his food divinely. He knew how to taste life. Mozart was like a kid who didn't really know the world around him, he drank without knowing the taste, and playing without understanding the fun. Don't get me wrong, I never disliked Mozart. To the contrary, I am a big fan of his music, and I do think he saw the world's beauty in an equally rewarding way. But I find both the two characters fascinating, and I can't help liking Salieri more in this film.",

With Peter Shaffer's game of ""What if...?"" that comprises much of the film (i.e. what if Salieri recognized his own shortcomings in sight of Mozart's genius, and then...), the stage is set for true drama.  There is conflict galore in this multi-layered film, and it brings the heart of the humanities close to us.  Why do we love music and what makes it great?

534,12 December 2006,revelation59,7," Great Man, so-so movie","I think this bit of history is the tragedy of the Roman Catholic church as well as some more recent Christian churches in America that have lost the meaning of the word GRACE. Mozart (Amadeus) was one of the greatest classical music composers of all time. Yet he was murdered through the use of psychology by a crafty satanic jealous Catholic priest-Salieri. He could not see how God could give such a great musical gift to a man who he perceived as being toally immoral! Salieri denied the Christina faith and sold his soul to Satan like Dracula in the movie BRAM STOKER'S Dracula! Some of the world's most evil people are connected to the church! As witness to what manipuLators clergy are and were, the chess opening, The Ruy Lopez, was invented by a Spanish Bishop of the same name!So, I really think I benefit from not being accepted in church. And I think I have some evil Salieri in my own life, some smug self-righteous religious jerk who tries to destroy my life as well. And as the movie ends, the point I also see is that at the end of even a great historical life, the Grim Reaper comes for you and they wrap your body in a shroud, throw you in a hole and cover you up with dirt!

I say this because there are a number of things that contribute to a film being great, and Amadeus achieves perfection in every single area. When the film starts, and while the screen is still black you hear the thunderous, dramatic opening to Mozart's ""Don Giovanni,"" you know you're in for something special.

539,10 January 2013,SchimoCro,8, Mozart through the eyes of Salieri,"The life story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart told retrospectively from the perspective of his contemporary and rival, the imperial composer Antonio Salieri, who at the end of his life is confessing to a priest in a believe that he is responsible for Mozarts death. Most of the story shows last years of Mozarts life, his character, his career, his personal life and his death. The technical part is done well, especially the scenery that makes a visual impression fantastic. Mozart's music is blended into the content of the film and is a great foundation for consistently strong atmosphere. It's a shame that some potentially great scenes were somewhat ruined with very bad camera work although Forman generally did very good job. Besides the historical inaccuracies that pervade the entire film, bad reactions were provoked by the choice of Tom Hulce as Mozart. Tom did great job, he gave his best and probably did all that was asked of him but he's just not suited for the role. Shaffer and Forman vision of Mozart is maybe correct, but it certainly is different from vision of biggest par of the audience. F. Murray Abraham is brilliant in the lead role of Antonio Salieri and was rewarded for it with Oscar and a Golden Globe. The movie won 8 Oscars and it's shares that number with movies like Gandhi and Gone With the Wind. The screenplay is very good in almost every aspect besides historical inaccuracies. The characters are wonderfully developed, the dialogues are strong and most importantly the story keeps viewers to the screen for the entire 160 minutes. This is one of the titles that absolutely no one should miss, but either before or after viewing, it may be good to read historically accurate story.",

I had not seen Amadeus or even ever heard of it. So i rented this DVD with reservations about watching some preachy drama about the life of Mozart but boy was i surprised after the first 5 minutes, that's how long this movie takes to grip you.. grip you very tightly. I have never experienced this kind of delight at the very beginning of a movie. The acting is great, The director deserved his Oscar many times over and the costumes are just breathtaking but all of it fades in front of the Music, the music that is timeless, the music you probably didn't even know was composed by the great Mozart. This story transcends time and connects to you on a personal level, its a story about jealousy, brilliance, passion, music, mediocrity, selfishness and above all creativity. Some of us have to chisel hard to get out the best of us but some are just born with the perfect composition. This movie gets a perfect 10.",
573,13 July 2013,kulpank,8, Musical Opulence,"Amadeus Amadeus is a biography of Mozart as told by Antonio Salieri. It shows the rise and fall of Mozart brought about by external factors and his own. It showcases the life of not just Mozart but also of Salieri. The movie starts in the present with out of control bleeding Salieri and his confession of having murdered Mozart. It is a flashback of his time and his journey with Mozart. Salieri is jealous yet almost reverent of Mozart. It depicts his love for music but lack of his geniuses. Mozart on the other hand is irreverent and lewd but a genius from whom music flows as if God himself speaks through him. The movie shows the trials and tribulations of Salieri to out do Mozart, at the same time the dedication and frivolity of Mozart. His obsession to rise above him yet to seek his approval leads him to actions with far greater impact. The movie though titled on Mozart, is of Salieri and how Mozart played a very crucial part in his life. Amadeus in Latin means ""Loved by God"" and is an apt title for the movie. Mozart as the man of god is a common theme of this film. Many a times Salieri makes this comparison and begrudges it. F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart are brilliant. They provide life to larger than life characters. The hatred, the reverence, the desire to share that one moment of fame are emoted effortlessly by Abraham. The tinkle laughter and boyishness of Mozart as played by Hulce, remains with you. Every emotion feels realistic and though set in time long before the present, where the styles of expression were a lot different, the movie manages to convey itself flawlessly. The supporting cast is brilliant with its effort. The costumes are grand and the sets are lavish. The depiction is interspersed by the music of the operas. The direction is fast paced and doesn't loose the audiences at any step. The film is vibrant yet dark. It carries with it deep sadness of the human emotions, But also celebrates life through the language of music.",

586,17 March 2012,gregory75,8, Excellent film,"I would have preferred to have seen more of his thought processes though, because Forman's glimpse of how Mozart applied his genius is extremely exciting to watch, but short lived. Characterisations are brilliantly engineered. Salieri is scheming and yet outwardly indifferent to Mozart. We can see that he loves the music of his superior, and yet is torn apart by his own inadequacy. Inadequacy is a fitting word for Salieri's skill as portrayed by Forman, who wanted to give the greatest contrast possible in terms of the virtuosity of the two men, without making Salieri look like a complete cretin. He is, after all, known as maestro Salieri. Constanze Mozart (Elizabeth Berridge) is on first appearances a giggling girl, and yet through the course of the film we are shown that she is very shrewd, and is ruthless when dealing with finance. Roy Dotrice's Leopold Mozart has a masterful air, and maintains an oppressive paternal hold over his son even after his death, the analogy being the use of an enveloping cloak. The cloak is used as part of Leopold's street wear, but is also part of the costume of the statue in the first showing of Don Giovanni, where Salieri is certain that the imposing figure of the giant statue represents the recently deceased Leopold. In short, Forman presents us with a marvelous psychological essay on weakness and power, both superficial and real. This is obviously no average biographical motion picture, but a film conceived with an intelligence nearing that of it's subject. We are shown Mozart's virtuosity several times, which again provides wonderful excitement. He not only plays variations of his music thought up on the spot (at the party scene) but plays them in the styles of other composers, upside down. He infuriates Salieri by arranging a welcoming march actually written for Mozart (and taken to be wonderful by the Italian up to this point), showing off his outstanding skills whilst looking around at the assembled courtiers and cackling with glee. Those who have watched this scene with me have either laughed or smiled in sheer wonderment at a majestic combination of music, acting and direction. This film is a gem, combining sometimes ridiculous comedy with deep tragedy. On the negative side, it would benefit opera buffs more than concert goers, because opera is the dominant musical genre of the movie. (Specially designed opera productions have been woven into the film; greatly extending it's length but adding that extra colour and vibrancy). The film becomes heavy and slow moving as it nears its astonishingly refreshing conclusion at the lunatic asylum, noticeable largely due to the contrast with a lighter beginning. This may test the patience of some viewers, but once the credits roll, I guarantee that the majority of those who have watched Amadeus will be struck by the passing of such a wonderfully colourful and rewarding masterpiece, and will not want to move from their seats until the tranquil piano concerto fades away. The film deserves all its eight Oscars, and I give it 9 out of 10.",

And a sallery who was answered by Mozart's music and hated everything else about him.
With unparalleled directing and acting,
The director's genius in merging symphonies and operas with the event is truly impressive.
The selection of the music itself is impressive, and all the music is written by Mozart and Salieri,
Acting is something indescribable, especially Murray Abraham in the role of Saleri.

Winner of 8 Academy Awards, including: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor in A Leading Role, Best Director and Best Motion Picture, Milos Forman knew what he wanted to create with this film from the get go. After coming off of a fresh Best Picture-Director-Screenplay Academy Award multi-win for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest in 1975, he wanted to do more with his new American career. Thus, he teamed up with fellow friend and co-producer of Cuckoo's Nest, Saul Zaentz and the playwright of the acclaimed Amadeus Peter Shaffer himself to create not only a fantastic epic poem of love, comedy, melancholia, hate and envy, but a monument in cinema. Luckily, the first time I saw this masterpiece was for its 3-hour Director's Cut in January. Since then, I have watched-ahem, I mean, experienced this wonder 6 times. The only reason it's not 10/10 is because it's operatic themes are a bit repetitive, though that is a pretty stupid complaint really. Watch this or die.",

Depicting Mozart as some douche who got music without trying is so wrong. He might have been a douche, but he worked hard on his music. One expected to see the struggles of the musician, both external and intenral of which we see none. All we see him is bedding woman after woman. One would expect the filmmakers to have done basic research on how mozart actually helped bring music to the masses instead of reserving it for the hoiety toiety of the court which is precisely why he was more popular the Sallieri. But do we see any of that? Nope. They have made this into a petty envy movie between musicians competing for emperor's attention. There is so much surrounding the life of mozart and the changes he brought into how music was written and for whom. But the moviemakers decided we need none of that. We are content showing mozart as some sort of old timey axl rose and call it a day. I seriously dont understand why people like this. It doesnt make them any more informed about the bare history let alone develops their understanding of music. People will come out with this misinformation in their heads and feel informed.

Since this scene is happening sometime in the early-to-mid 1780's, Haydn, born in 1732, would not have aged to the extent shown in the portrait, and in fact, it appears to be a copy of the one painted by John Hoppner, dating from 1791, substantially later than the time of the scene.",

607,19 June 2013,b_olson81,9, Excellent!!,"As a student of art history, I was fascinated by how much history really came across on screen. Not necessarily historical fact (I know that Salieri didn't murder Mozart, and most likely didn't try, and there were undoubtedly many other inaccuracies, due to the need for condensation). When I think history, I usually think of the history of ideas. And if you want to look at the historical development that took place from the idea of the artist dedicated to God, and the modern one of an artist as a tormented individual, striving for excellence on his own, you can see it in Salieri. And the film also made it clear how the coming revolutionary changes in 18th-19th Europe were to carry the artist from having to please a patron to having to make it in a democratic marketplace (well, until the founding of the NEA, anyway). Just compare this film to that odious monstrosity ""Shakespeare in Love"", which also, inconceivably, won a Best-Pictur Oscar! There, nothing goes beyond dull sitcom contrivance and clichés about the theater, and the conception of the characters is so thoroughly twentieth-century that no real historical ideas can possibly get though.

Just because you father or mother was a famous actor does not give these people merit as to being talented themselves...ugh...Hollywood Monarchy. I probably sound angry and bitter, I am. So what? Back to the subject at hand. Amadeus, good film , sober or stoned. Give it a try.",

In response to a dead man who is not afraid, there are living people who must be angry
This magnificent work of me reminds me of that person
Truly, Satan is an ancestor among us humans",
629,21 April 2018,gautamcheers,10," Mozart, Oh Mozart!!!","Too many bangs! Well, they don't come any better these days. Did the camera ever capture such ephemeral emotions, or did it switch to CG... well folks, this movie has too much of impossible positives, and the world can only handle so much (believe me, or read your newspaper). I'll proceed chronologically... gluttony succeeded by deflation, innocence succeeded by truth, and, guilt succeeded by absolution. Imagine a magician of colors playing to an audience of the colorblind but one. Imagine a gossamer apparatus touched by the imperfect. How does one restore back the magic? Perhaps the perfect can only come out of the imperfect. Mayhap our enemy only waits for us to spread our arms. Some things can't be undone, but some things are just meant to be. Oh a world with the focus of the protagonist and the disdain of the mundane!
Listen to this 'film' if you can't watch it enough now and then.",
630,13 September 2020,mohamedgamal-58475,10, It's a must-watch masterpiece.,"The film simply tells the story of the ups and downs in Mozart's life from Salieri's perspective, and that is what makes it one of the most layered films at the level of characters throughout history, where the narration is done by someone who hates Mozart very much and feels very jealous towards him and the movie tells about Salieri who wants Mozart's destruction in any possible way, but in the end he also bears full respect and appreciation for his talent. and the movie take this journey with our characters to tell us so many values in our lives. so, we see the most bad thing in Salieri's character is his neglecting his talent and we see him don't work hardly to be the guy he wants to be and only he is thinking about how to exceed Mozart in everything, and here we know the difference between Mozart and Salieri, the difference is that Mozart works until he fulfill his dream but Sailers works to destroy Mozart.",
631,22 January 2020,laurenloeweli,10, Childhood Favorite,Mozart was my favorite composer in high school. I've watched this movie over a thousand times. I will say that my playing Mozart's piano concertos prior to watching the film changed drastically after the film.,
632,13 January 2019,OnlyMakeYouStronger,9, What a splendid way to spend and evening,"After watching the film tonight and still 35 years later, I cannot believe that it didn't take more oscars like cinematography to name one example. Each scene was carefully shot with the utmost care of the quality of light, depth of field and most of all with joy. Every sound carefully placed in the ear to remind me of just how important and beautiful music is to me and how human the creative players are that make it. This work goes beyond an oscar in my book.",
