2,8 April 2002,Zonieboy,10, A beautiful fable for now and the future,"I believe everyone has a right to their opinion about films or other topics. However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.",e
3,7 April 2006,Hitchcoc,10, Pure Charm,"Every once in a while, something comes along that hasn't been done before. This movie is one of those things. First of all, we have a principal character whose take on life is one where you don't judge it; you live it. I know he's a film character. It doesn't matter because we use images such as these to inspire us and to give us our own way of treating each day. Forrest lets no grass grow under his feet. He is the consummate optimist. He doesn't complain because he sees early on that it does you no good. His life is one adventure after another, in and out of the public eye, but his shyness and demeanor don't ever get to his head. He is the epitome of patience, something sadly lacking in the lives of most Americans. He is pushed around by the gusts of time and always lands on his feet. His relationship with a troubled girl is the one consistent thing in his life, and that is also shows his pugnaciousness. There are some commentators and reviewers who call this character stupid. He is a slow processor, but his stability lies in his morality and his consistency. His mother raised him well.",v

5,15 December 2007,blairgallop7,10, Forrest Gump is a movie masterpiece that won't be forgotten and will continue to inspire,"He may have been good in Philadelphia but be is excellent in Forrest Gump.Tom Hanks delivers another great performance in his career by portraying the lovable,king yet not so intelligent character Forrest Gump.It is also Tom Hanks' second straight win for the Best Actor Oscar which he becomes the second man to do said accomplishment after Spencer Tracy.Whilst not as dramatic as Philadelphia,Tom Hanks' performance is just as great in this movie and this movie could possibly be the film of Tom Hanks' career as he used to be a comedy guy who turned to drama in a way which would paved for future stars such as Jim Carrey(The Truman Show),Reese Witherspoon(Walk the Line) and Will Ferrell(Stranger Than Fiction) to name a few.Also staring in this great movie classic are Robin Wright-Penn who plays Jenny,Gary Sinise who was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Lieutenant Dan Taylor,Mykelti Williamson as Forrest's best friend and shrimper Benjamin Buford""Bubba"" Blue and Sally Field as Mrs.Gump.This film was nominated for a total of thirteen Academy Awards but won six of them which include Best Film Editing,Best Visual Effects,Best Adapted Screenplay,Best Picture,Best Director-Robert Zemeckis and Best Actor-Tom Hanks.This is one masterpiece of a movie that will not be forgotten about in a long time.Bravo!",e
6,13 March 2003,george.schmidt,10, Contemporary classic: one of my all-time faves,"FORREST GUMP (1994) **** Tom Hanks, Sally Field, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson. Brilliantly directed and inspiring comic drama about the truly extraordinary life and times of mentally challenged Forrest Gump (Hanks in the best role of his career won his second Best Actor Oscar in back-to-back winning roles), a simple, honest, and decent man whose childlike innocence is his lucky charm through his altering experiences that span the past two decades flawlessly. Mind-boggling Oscar-winning computerized effects by Industrial Light & Magic has Gump meeting the famous and infamous. Hanks is a wonder (dare you not to get a lump in your throat when it finally registers that he has a child {yes, that's Haley Joel Osment}- watch his face!) and gets fine support especially Wright as the love of his life and Sinise as his best friend (Best Supporting Actor nominee) superior adaptation of Winston Groom's novel by Eric Roth (also an Academy Award recepient) that truly captures lightning in a bottle. Oscars also went to director Robert Zemeckis and for Best Picture. *** One of my all-time favorite flicks. I still cry, particularly Forrest telling Jenny why he loves her so much (""You're my girl!"") and at the gravesite when the birds fly overhead.",w
7,31 May 2004,kenhe,10, Purity and innocence retained,"I have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times, and I find that the beauty of the film is how Forrest Gump not only shares his innocence and purity with others, including the audience, he also manages to retain that innocence and purity through some very difficult times. As a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gump endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so perfectly understated that Forrest Gump's travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history only became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us.",/
8,22 December 2012,AlsExGal,10, The role of innocence in positive thinking and thus success ...,"... seems to be the theme of this film. Forrest Gump has an IQ of 70, is being raised by a single mom, lives in a remote part of the Deep South where there are few opportunities, and has legs that require that he wear braces as a child. Sounds like the recipe for a sad tale or at least a slow death from mediocrity right? No, instead, because Forrest isn't really bright enough to realize the situation he is in, he simply does what he's told to do or what occurs to him to be the right thing at the time and succeeds due to a lack of self doubt. He's told to run and he becomes the star of the Crimson Tide and an All American. When recovering from a war wound, he's taught ping-pong and winds up competing at the global level in China itself. He promises his dying friend Bubba that he'll go ahead with their plans and become a shrimp boat captain and his brand of seafood products becomes a household name.All along the way he never learns the lessons in life that tend to make the rest of us cynical.",r
9,23 April 2005,schmimic,10, Tom Hanks delivers an astounding performance as Forrest Gump.,"Starring: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Sally Field This was flat out one of the best movies of 1994. It won best picture for a reason, along with a few other Academy Awards. I think one of the tag lines for the movie was, ""The world will never be the same once you've seen it through the eyes of Forrest Gump."" How true. The movie is basically one simple man's journey through life. And what a journey.",w
10,1 December 2007,john in missouri,10, Quite possibly the best movie ever made.,"I've seen most of the top-voted 30 or 40 movies here at IMDb, and Forrest Gump probably wins my vote for the single best movie ever made.",3
11,12 February 2021,kosmasp,10, Mama said ...,"Take this with a grain of salt and don't be mad about certain things. Like one of the first flashbacks to the very beginning that does not come over preachy when it talks about the Klan (Ku Klux Klan that is, just in case you think I'm talking about any other Klan). Maybe sometime in the near future there will be a disclaimer and someone giving this context. But until then, you have to be educated enough yourself to understand and comprehend certain things. And you have to have a certain sense of humor to dig all the coincidences that Gump comes across at. It's alike a marathon through many landmarks of the short US history we have behind us. Like the Watergate scandal, Vietnam War, Black Panthers and so much more.",3
12,25 December 2020,Xstal,10, Encapsulating...,"... all that is, all that was and all that will ever be, through the life experiences of the titular character performed to perfection by Tom Hanks whose generous performance leaves us humbled and in awe of what we can achieve, how we can achieve it and why we would want that achievement in the first instance. A piece of cinematic storytelling that will perpetually resonate no matter who or what you are, where you are going or who you are going with - timeless.",8
13,22 November 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9, Beautiful film,"Forrest Gump, I think is a beautiful film. Never too schmaltzy, but there are some genuine tearjerkers like Forrest at Jenny's grave. The cinematography is stunning, the costumes are lovely and the scenery is gorgeous. The music is also very calm and relaxing, perhaps adding to the tone of this film. The screenplay is well crafted, and the story is simple. But what made this movie was its simplicity; it never tries to be too complex and is consequently moving. The acting is just as impressive; whilst Tom Hanks's accent is a little awkward in places, my only real criticism of this movie, he gives a truly remarkable performance, though I do think Morgan Freeman deserved the Oscar more for Shawshank. Robin Wright gives possibly the best performance of her career, and Sally Field is very dignified as Forrest's mother. The scene stealer though is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan, a very moving and insightful performance. Overall, an extremely good movie, I will admit I wasn't sure whether I would like it, but the simple answer is this, I do. 9/10 Bethany Cox",4
14,1 April 2000,Quinoa1984,10, One of the best films of the 90's,"Winston Groom's Forrest Gump was a novel that was complicated, but (Oscar winning) director Robert Zemeckis brings events together with visual effects that boggle even George Lucas. ",5
15,13 February 2010,bkoganbing,10, The Hand Of An Unseen Providence,When Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for Philadelphia in 1993 the film received a total of five nominations. His second Oscar for Forrest Gump came in a film that received more than double that in nominations and awards. If Forrest Gump did nothing else it solidified Hanks's credentials as a serious actor. He would never be doing imitations of his Bosom Buddies character in films again.,4
16,14 February 2005,adinutzza2001,10, why such a low rating???,"What I find completely ridiculous is why this movie, in my opinion one of the best ever, has such a low rating, so I've tried to figure out what some found against it.I noticed that the haters of this movie who make it have a lower rating than it actually deserves mainly argue that it promotes the government's politics of submission: the idea that ""if you're an idiot but you do what you're told then you will be rewarded, but, if you experience life then you're going to die a miserable death."" I'm not an American myself so i don't have any intention to defend the government or anyone else, but I think that the political events witnessed by the character in the movie make many miss the whole substance of the film. I think these bits of history only add to the magic of the film, making Forrest part of a fantastic world that seems so incredibly real though. ",9
17,20 June 2005,sundrymules,10, The zen of Forrest Gump.,"This is a powerful yet charming movie; fun for its special effects and profound in how it keeps you thinking long after it's over. Like others, I've seen this movie more than once. One comment I've never heard is that Forrest's simplicity is almost zen-like. I should read the novel to get the author's intention (I remember some people preferring the book and complaining that no one at the Academy Awards gave him any credit.) But rather than an implication that you should do what you're supposed to do and believe in God and you'll win in the end, I see it as zen-like, i.e., living in the moment and not having expectations or particular cravings (other than his loving Jenny.) So he ends up just stumbling into all the major historical events of the time. Granted, he achieves this only because he doesn't have the brains to think otherwise and actually have expectations, but so many of our problems are because we do have higher intellect and desires, which ironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing. We love our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in the moment. There's a line in the movie wondering if everything is predestined or happens randomly or it's a combination of both. It is something to mull over for a long time.",/
18,25 May 2005,lacey_joeskip7,10, Life's Lessons in one Movie...,When I first saw this movie I didn't appreciate it like I do now. I think it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there's no hope... I just love this movie. And anyone who hasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it I seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing...,?
19,30 July 2016,ironhorse_iv,9, Life is like a box of chocolates. You never truly know what you're gonna get. Forrest Gump is amazing!,"Based on the 1986 novel by Winston Groom of the same name; Forrest Gump is about a simple man, named Forrest (Tom Hanks) whom with a low I.Q. who goes through life, accidentally being present at many historic moments, while building success for himself, however, never getting with his true love, Jenny Curran (Robin Wright) which mostly seems to be the only thing, that is eluding him. Without spoiling the movie, too much, this feel-good, financial blockbuster was indeed one of my favorite movies from the 1990s. I still quote, act out, & rewatch this movie, even with the downer tragic ending, this film has. I just can't help, loving it, despite the film changing a lot from the source material, like Gump's core personality and size. I kinda like that, he's not an autistic savant. In my opinion, it would be, too jarring. It would be, really too odd and unrealistic to see him, play chess, while being an astronaut, while people still thinking that he's an idiot. I kinda like that the film primarily focuses on the first eleven chapters of the novel, before skipping ahead to the end of the book. The middle part of the book is truly outrageous with Gump fighting off, cannibals, and becoming a pro-wrestler. That was way too out there to be taken seriously! The careers, he got in the film, seems more grounded with the reality of his character and the story. In addition to skipping some parts of the novel, the film adds several aspects to Gump's life that do not occur in the novel, such as his needing leg braces as a child and his run across the United States. Those changes really did help the film, a lot. This movie was also well shot by Robert Zemeckis. It made great use of its locations. I also love the use of CGI techniques to make it look like Tom Hanks was in some of the archive footage with various historical figures. Most of the visual effects in this film were pretty impressing at the time. Yet, I just wish the voice-dubbing was a little better. It doesn't really match well, with the movement of the long-dead historical figure's lips! While, the movie does have a lot of profanity, sex/nudity, drug use and violence for a PG-13. I think it somewhat works with the rebellions style of the 1960s. I also dig the film soundtrack. Great use of many well-known artists of the 1950s & 1960s. It's really does fit with that era of time. Also, the original music that Alan Silvestri made for the film was also beautiful. It fits some well in the film. Not only did that work, but the acting was outstanding. Tom Hanks was amazing as the title character. In other hands, this dim-witted, guileless, Southern-drawling simpleton hero could had turn into a bumbling yet annoying unlikeable offensive mental retarded stereotype. Instead, Hanks makes the fictional character, Gump seem like a real person with real motives and feelings. He really did deserve the Oscar, despite what some critics make say about his performance. Even the supporting cast was well-done. I love all of the characters ranging from 'Bubba' Blue (Mykelti Williamson) to Mrs. Gump (Sally Fields). I even kinda like Jenny, even when the writers made her, somewhat a horrible selfish trouble-person, who leaves Gump with a kid that grew up to be Haley Joan Osment in one of his first movie roles. Then- who can ever forget, Lt. Dan Taylor? This was Gary Sinise finest role. The character development that they gave him, was heart-breaking, yet hopeful. I love his redemption story. The film has this 'ignorance is bliss' philosophy to it; that makes the movie, fun to watch. The satire on contemporary values, during America's mid-20th century accomplishments is truly funny. The historic 'zelig' style jokes are mostly a hit than a miss to the funny. I also like how ambiguous, Forrest's story, as some people believe that he might be an unreliable narrator who whitewashing American history. Yet, I don't think, it's as racist or sexist as some people think, it is. The film is a lot more positive than that. Forrest is a represented of what is innocence and good about the world. He has this, out right decency about himself. He helps his friends if they're in need, even if some of them, take advanced of his hospitality. Forrest Gump is also a surprisingly spiritual story, well-told. A lot of people has stated out, the relationship between Forrest and Jenny echoes the relationship of Hosea and Gomer in the Old Testament; which in return is about, the relationship between God and man. Hints, the white feather that floats through Forrest's life. The movie is about the question of whether we are masters of our own fate or on a path to a predetermined destiny. Another thing, interesting, is how some people has been noted to see some political interpretations which I kinda have to disagree with. While, it seem like Gump follows a very conservative lifestyle, Jenny's life is full of counter-cultural embrace, complete with drug usage, promiscuity, and antiwar rallies, and that their eventual marriage might be a kind of reconciliation between America's extremes political points; I agree with Hanks, the film was non-political and non-judgmental. Forrest Gump isn't about liberal or conservative values. It's about learning to live with your limitations, while also giving it, everything you got. About the film winning best picture in 1994 over films like 'The Shawshank Redemption' & 'Pulp Fiction', I think the movie deserve it. While, on the surface, those other two films look superior better and more mature. In true, 'Forrest Gump' has just as much to give as those films. Also, it's by far, the more entertaining film of the three. Overall: Forrest Gump is like a box of chocolates. It's super sweet.",r
20,9 September 2014,tavm,10," After 20 years, I still love Forrest Gump!","When I originally watched this with my mom 20 years ago, we both were pretty touched by the events of Forrest Gump's life and the way he handled things. So now, watching this in IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend, it's the same feelings all over again but now having some additional life experiences, one notices things one hadn't thought of before. Like how the first person who sits with Forrest on the park bench is so uninterested in his story she takes the wrong bus and admits it to him while the last one who sits with him doesn't take her scheduled one because she's so immersed in hearing about his life! Or how Jenny realizes how much she truly loves him despite the way she sometimes treated him. Robert Zemeckis truly made a very compelling picture. And Tom Hanks delivered a wonderful performance worthy of a second Oscar win. Nice humorous stuff involving Hanks mixed in real news footage of the various presidents. And great music soundtrack to mark the times they lived in. Oh, and I loved the supporting cast of Mykelti Williamson, Sally Field, Gary Sinise, and Robin Wright as Jenny. With all that said, I'll now just say that Forrest Gump is worth all the praise and adulation it has gotten over the years.",e

22,12 June 2011,classicsoncall,10," ""I just felt like running"".","For anyone who grew up in the turbulent Sixties, ""Forrest Gump"" delivers a clever blend of nostalgia mixed with a uniquely creative view of history as experienced by a presumed to be simpleton. While Tom Hanks' character recalls his life with a slow tangy drawl, he variously entertains and educates a host of passengers waiting for the next bus to their intended destination. Some ignore him, some show interest, one even scorns Gump's tale of getting rich in the shrimping business, only to depart before Forrest has a chance to pull out his copy of Fortune Magazine. Life can be like that for those unwilling to listen and learn, casting doubt instead of exploring the truth and keeping an open mind.",_

I've watched the movie about once every two years since then. This is an amazing movie in any number of ways. One big way it amazes me, is the way which it, as a simple and guileless little story, like a feather wafting in the breeze, nevertheless evokes raw rank hatred and eyeball-bulging, forehead vein-popping, spittle-spewing vitriol from liberals and so-called ""intellectuals"" who are absolutely certain that, like a guided missile, it is seeking them out, intentionally, personally, to insult them with rightwing thoughts and ideas, and by a nitwit character no less.

But in reality, it is a well-made film with some strong performances but not more than that.

26,27 November 2014,Horst_In_Translation,8," Timeless masterpiece, very unique","20 years after ""Forrest Gump"" came out, I decided to rewatch this one and it was even better than what I remembered from watching it the first time. The film won 6 Academy awards in 1995, including Best Picture, Best Director (Robert Zemeckis, ""Back to the Future""-trilogy, ""Cast Away"" again with Hanks later on) and Best Actor (2nd win in a row for Hanks after ""Philadelphia""). And even if it lost ""Best Score"" to ""The Lion King"", the music, especially the main theme, is nothing short of brilliant.

30,11 March 2005,jboothmillard,9, Forrest Gump,"From Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated director Robert Zemeckis (The Back to the Future Trilogy), this is a remarkable comedy drama based on the novel by Winston Groom. Basically, Forrest Gump (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Tom Hanks) is the low-intelligence but friendly man on a bus stop bench, and telling his life story to all strangers who sit down. The film is basically chronicles of his life accidentally ending up in big events of America between the 1950's and the 1970's, and finding fame and fortune without wanting or asking for it. These include meeting Elvis Presley, being put on an American football team for his running speed, meeting President John F. Kennedy, joining the army for the Vietnam war, becoming a Ping Pong champion, receiving the congressional medal of honour from President Richard Nixon, becoming a shrimp boat captain with his own company and running across America for two years. Within these adventures in his life, he always thinks of those close to him, the love of his life Jenny Curran (Golden Globe nominated Robin Wright Penn), friend Lt. Dan Taylor (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Gary Sinise), friend Pvt. Benjamin Buford 'Bubba' Blue (Mykelti Williamson) and his mother Mrs. Gump (BAFTA nominated Sally Field), and with his low-intelligence he does not realise the significance of his actions. Also starring Siobhan Fallon as Dorothy Harris, School Bus Driver, Alexander Zemeckis (Robert's son) as School Bus Boy, Elizabeth Hanks (Tom's daughter) as School Bus Girl and The Sixth Sense's Haley Joel Osment as Forrest Gump Jr. This is one of those films you cannot ignore, even if some people think not to watch it, but like Forrest says ""I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I, I think maybe it's both"" (this explains the use of the feather at the beginning and end). Personally, this is a film I would definitely recommend to see, and not just because of Hanks in what has to be one of his best roles. It won the Oscars for Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Makeup, Best Music for Alan Silvestri (he should have) and Best Sound, it won the BAFTA for Best Special Effects, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. Tom Hanks was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 39 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 40 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.""), it was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for Forrest at Jenny's grave, it was number 37 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 71 on 100 Years, 100 Movies.

Nothing I hated, but nothing I try to watch when I see it on the television either. The story revolves around the character of the title Forrest Gump of course. It basically goes through different parts of his life and shows how a very simple man led a rather astonishing life. A rather unrealistic life filled with a bit to much melodrama for my tastes. I can see why others like this movie, but once again just not really my type of movie. Tom Hanks is good in the lead role and I also thought Gary Sinese was good in his role too, however I did not care for the character of Jenny as she just ticked me off to no end. The film is also better in some places than other as the film really has a rather disjointed feel to it. It goes from here to there and is not hard to follow at times though it just feels like a patchwork movie. The Vietnam portion of the film to me was the highlight, here the comedy was good and even the drama worked too. Other sections of the film at times just felt to underdeveloped. Here is Forrest entering college, now he is done two minutes later, here is Forrest playing ping pong, now he is back Washington D.C. at a black panther party. Like I said it has its moments, but for me it was a bit to all over the place like they tried to get everything that was in the book up on screen. And as short as some of this segments were you then have a rather lengthy scene of just him running, though that one was rather good even though it was simple. I will never see how this film beat out ""True Lies"" for the best special effects Oscar, I was not overly impressed with the scenes Forrest was inserted in as it simply looked like they animated the mouths of those he was supposed to be meeting and they sort of stuck him in there using file footage of John F. Kennedy for example. I just thought it was just a bit better technique used than that of a Steve Martin film ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid"".

56,14 February 2010,Galina_movie_fan,10, ...And that's all I have to say about Forrest Gump,"I think of Forrest Gump (1994) directed by Robert Zemeckis as a fantasy or a fairy tale set in the real world, and what a marvelous tale it is. It's been 15 years since I saw the film for the first time with my 13- years-old son. We were impressed, touched, and moved by it equally. We laughed, we could not contain tears, and we lived together with the hero, the childlike, naive, and innocent Forrest Gump, the most unusual lead character you can think of. FG was a big hit when it was released, and it went on to receive 6 Oscars including for The Best Picture, Director, Best Actor, Best Visual Effects, and Best Screen Play. The film's Oscar status has made it one of the controversial choices among the film viewers. Some completely agree that FG deserved all its awards and its love. The others, and quite few to that believe that the film is totally overrated, sickly sweet, and it is nothing more than the American propaganda of mediocrity. They believe that the film's main idea is, follow the orders, do what you are told, and even if your intellect is low or almost non-existent, with a little bit of luck, you would achieve the success in your life and even would change the history by simply being at the right place in the right time. How wrong I believe they are. You can't think of Forrest Gump as a real person. He is a fairy tale character, or rather the embodiment of a human with no cynicism whatsoever, the candid, pure, innocent man who is not quick or witty but who knows bad from good and right from wrong and through whose eyes we see the historical events in the live of this country for about thirty years of the last Century. Forrest may not be an intellectual prodigy but he was led through life's hardships, by the inner moral compass if you will and he knows the very simple truths that he never misses - love and loyalty to his mother, his friends, the girl he loves and his Country.

59,12 September 2014,matthewssilverhammer,9, Sincere and Sweet,"There aren't many movies that have penetrated the subconscious of the American zeitgeist as intensely as Gump, and it's not hard to see why. It's a film that deftly mixes nearly every genre into one epic tale, yet never shies away from the importance of small moments. But with this much love, cynicism and (some deserved) scorn aren't far behind: terms like ""on-the nose"" and ""syrupy sweet"" come to mind. But what's the advantage of this cynicism when it's so rewarding to just sit back and enjoy? At its core, Gump is pure Hollywood magic that deserves to be treasured. Essentially a biopic of a fictional character, Gump is first-person-perspective storytelling with a protagonist who sees much but perceives littleat least not in the same way we do. Swimming in historical fiction and even magical realism, he impacts American history: presidents are met, classic songs are heard, Vietnam wars are foughtyet Forrest's gaze is set on one thing: love. It's silly and whimsical, yet consistently surprising to see Forrest navigate through life with such sincerity and tenacity. Lest we neglect how technically impeccable the film is. The aesthetic is simplistic and gorgeous, and the effects (missing limbs, altered historical footage) are light years ahead of what they should be. But these things are rarely mentioned because they aren't the point. Zemeckis wants the movie to be the same as its hero: simple, random, sincere. Gump's unconditional love, overwhelming kindness, and naïve determination got him wherever he needed to be, and that journey leaves him and us in stitches, while never abandoning hope. Manipulative? Maybeor maybe it's just great filmmaking.",

The movie starts out as a story about a boy who overcomes a handicap with a strong single mother (played by Sally Field). The movie could have been then a ""low key"" version of Radio and made a statement about the obstacles one has to overcome. Instead, Zemeckis wanted to make a statement about American history from the 60s to the 80s. The result was a judgmental indictment without regard for the ""complexities"" involved. For example, we are supposed to think that Forrest Gump is so ""dimwitted"" that he doesn't care about civil rights, when a young black woman is trying to attend class. Is Zemeckis mocking civil rights? Then there is something about having to pee while shaking hands with LBJ. I guess some people find this funny, but it just appeared childish to me. Then, Gump goes off to Vietnam, leaving his ""flaky"", ""irresponsible"" girlfriend behind. You get tired easily of his girlfriend being portrayed as an irresponsible child. When he returns from 'Nam, he gets in a fight with some pretentious hippy, who is supposed to represent the entire anti-War movement. This really irritated me seeing all the complex issues of the 60s being used to subjectively attack the anti-war movement. After this slight, the movie moves on to a new story. Now Forrest is running for no reason. In the movie ""Convoy"", where this idea was borrowed from (switching from truckers to runners), there seemed to be a little bit of a political message. Forrest is just running for no rhyme or reason. By the end of the movie, I am just annoyed by his talk about a box of chocolate. This movie was extremely annoying, patronizing, and ignorant. Forrest Gump might of been a better, more honest movie, if Zemeckis stuck to the storyline, instead of pursuing a right-wing political agenda.",

65,22 January 2018,seveb-25179,4, A Forrest of complete Gump,"Everyone loves this movie... except me.
Somehow I find the contrast between the unsophisticated, often rather juvenile, style of humour, which is juxtaposed with issues like physical handicap, child molestation, mutilation from war, death from war and cancer, jarring and uncomfortable.
For me I would consider the type of broad acting in this film was fine if it were a pure comedy, such as ""Ground Hog Day"", but in this context, where serious issues are supposedly being addressed, it lacks the necessary degree of subtlety (or respect).
Tom Hanks performance is wonderful, but still essentially cartoonish, like Gomer Pyle. I don't at any time buy into his portrayal as a credible mentally challenged person. (As, for example, I was able to do with Dustin Hoffman in Rain-man)
I guess the Director's concept was for us to view the events from what is intended to be Forrest's limited perspective, but for me it doesn't work.
It's told as a fairy-tale, but personally I'm just not comfortable with many of these topics being dealt with in such a shallow fashion. Hitchcock knew how to mix humour with suspense, but it's not an easy trick to pull off, this film tries to mix tragedy with comedy and I find it an unpleasant mixture.
In the world where little girls are sexually molested by their fathers and young men have their legs amputated after being caught by an exploding shells, crippled kids don't become All American running backs (although they may become gold medal blade runners at the Paralympics!) and intellectually handicapped people don't become Shrimp magnates.
Don't get me wrong, I've nothing against a good fairy-tale, but I suspect this movie aspires to be allegorical and profound as well, which it is not.
The movie packs in so many traumatic situations that it fails to do any of them justice, and then casually throws historical ones in on top
The assassination of the Kennedys and John Lennon, along with attempts on George Wallis and Gerald Ford are mentioned, although Forrest is not present for any of them and doesn't strike me as a person who has any political awareness or would take notice of current events.
(However Martin Luthor King and Malcolm X are spared inclusion.)
The frequent use of familiar pop music from the period is another cheap trick to engage the emotions of the audience without doing the work. Much of the music has little or no connection to the story and even less to the character of Forrest, who has no interest, understanding, or emotional connection with the pop culture of the day.
Forrest is strangely detached from the World around him, and probably that's the intention?
But in that case what relevance or insight can his character have to the events through which he wanders?
I'm sure this story is intended to be very deep and meaningful, but really, Forrest Gump could as easily have been set in the 1920s, 30s or 40s for all the relevance or insight he brings to 50s, 60s, 70s culture.
The part of the movie where Forrest runs across country invites comparison to Peter Sellars character in ""Being There"", a holy fool, but FG lacks the depth of that movie, and in any case only has five minutes to spare on this topic before moving on again.
There is some tenuous and weak humour involving ""Sh*t Happens"" and smiley face tee shirts, but no actual words of ambiguous wisdom that might account for his following.
The film continues to throw issues and situations at us, like so many custard pies, hoping some will stick, but most end up being only half baked. (How do you like them mixed metaphors!)
The Apple shares bit is pure product placement, Forrest was already as rich as they want to make him via the Shrimp company.
And why would anyone offer the multimillion dollar owner of a Shrimp company a job mowing lawns?
Then we get not one, but two, tragic deaths by disease to weep about, first Mom from the big ""C"" and then ""me own me sporting Jenny"" from a cause never made clear.
Jenny only brings Forrest back into her life because she is dying, not because she loves him enough to want to share her life and their child with him. How is that inspirational?
Good things come to those who wait? The meek shall inherit the earth? 
The secret to true happiness is low expectations?

Of course Gump is a ""simpleton""; any complex opinions might likewise bring out similar thoughts in the audience, and we can't have that is a big shiny Hollywood movie.

This movie likes to think that if it can pass itself off as simple, it can pass of its truths as ""simple truths"" much like its foggy-headed main character.  Not so.  It's just simple, in a kind of idiotic way that makes us underestimate the complexities of our social history (speaking as a 23 year old, what do I know?, but I've been through a little bit) and come out with a shiny happy 90s answer to all these issues.

Finally, use cgi to work the retard into all the key TV/pop culture moments, guaranteed to melt a boomer's heart. Have him influence the whole world with his simple homespun Gomer Pyle platitudes.

He's hardly the most intelligent person in the world, but he's definitely the most caring, heart-warming and relatable character to ever appear in film.

The path towards present day is packed full of events and achievements, some of which include the Vietnam war, meeting the President (twice), unveiling the Watergate Scandal and running non- stop for over four years.

Nothing that happens to Forrest would happen in reality and don't tell me it's a parable, because I don't even think it works on that level. The truth is if I was sitting on a bench with Forrest and he started to tell me his life story, I would get up and leave because strangers who behave that way make me uncomfortable and many people would admit this if they were honest enough to get over the emotional aspects of the story. Jenny was a tramp who didn't love him and slept around and didn't deserve that slavish devotion. And the line ""Life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're going to get"" not only makes ""love means never having to say you're sorry"" look profound, but it's untrue to boot.

These movies often largely retain that success and esteem over the years (Gone with the Wind, Star Wars and Jaws among others) or age poorly and get viewed as undeserving of their huge success at the time (for instance, Independence Day). Although no movie appeals to absolutely everyone's taste, Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump certainly can be said to belong more in the former category. Released in 1994 it raked in nearly seven hundred million dollars worldwide, becoming the second biggest box office hit of '94 (after The Lion King) and mopped the floor at that year's Academy Awards, winning six trophies including Best Picture (although I prefer Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption by the tiniest of margins, but this isn't about those two), Director and Actor.

Not only did Zemeckis earn a Best Director Oscar, but also Tom Hanks' took home the Academy statuette for Best Actor with his insightful, down-to-earth thesping.

It skips around a good bit and ends up slightly disjointed. Overall, the story is OK, but not 6 Academy Awards worth. It's trying to preach a sermon about ordinary (or less) people being able to make it, yet the message gets lost in the rambling story.

The acting, the story, and how almost every big news event from the 1950s to the 1980s finds it's way in this film. Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a kid from Alabama with a low IQ of 75 and with braces on his legs. He meets a girl named Jenny Curran (Robin Wright) and they become good friends. Forrest starts to lead an extremely productive life. Despite his low IQ he is accepted into the University of Alabama and becomes part of the all American team. While there he witnesses George Wallace stand in the door, to keep African American students out. When he graduates he joins the US Army and serves in the Vietnam War. He befriends a fellow boot camp recruit, Private Benjamin Buford ""Bubba"" Blue (Mykelti Williamson) who has a dream of going into the shrimping business and his platoon commander Lieutenant Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise) who regards it as his destiny to die in combat like his ancestors before him had all done. In one part the platoon is ambushed by the Viet Cong. All the men are wounded. Forrest takes all the wounded men and brings them to safety, including Lieutenant Dan. Bubba dies and Lieutenant Dan is angry with Forrest for not letting him die in combat. In the Army hospital Forrest takes a liking to Ping Pong and becomes the Ping Pong champion, and receives the Medal of Honor for saving everyone. In Washington DC he meets Jenny again who has lead a life that is the opposite of Forrest's. She moves from failure to failure as she becomes a hippie and takes drugs while Forrest goes to China to play Ping Pong for the US against the Chinese team. He meets Lieutenant Dan in New York, New York who has now fallen into depression and is still mad at Forrest for leaving him a cripple. Forrest retires from the Army and goes to become Captain of a shrimp boat like Bubba wanted to do. Lieutenant Dan later becomes his first-mate and they begin to own a very successful shrimping business. Forrest meets Jenny again and they spend more time together before she leaves again. Then Forrest for no reason at all decides to take a long run all over Alabama at first and then all over the country. He meets Jenny again who now has a son named Forrest Jr. (Haley Joel Osment) and shortly after wards Forrest and Jenny are married, and their wedding is attended by Lieutenant Dan. Later Jenny sadly dies. The film ends as Forrest is waiting for the school bus to come by and pick up Forrest Jr. on the same tree stump that Forrest's mother (Sally Field) had waited by on Forrest Sr.s first day of school. I highly consider this to be Tom Hanks's best role in any movie he's done. I certainly recommend this film to everyone.",

122,3 December 2021,nickenchuggets,9, Stupid is as stupid does,"Some movies get such a ridiculous amount of acclaim that I have no choice but to be skeptical watching them. I say this because there's a ton of films that people view favorably only for nostalgia and not much else. For the longest time, I thought that this was the case with Forrest Gump, a movie that is often seen as one of the best in recent memory. Having never seen it before, I asked myself if it was actually worth seeing or just something that has been overhyped to an untouchable degree. After watching the whole movie, I can say that it is pretty impressive and well worth your time, but maybe it's not as amazing as everyone says. Personally, I thought it was good because of its subject matter. The story involves american history, but it is partially fictionalized in order to bring attention to the title character. Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a slow-witted man with an IQ barely above that of a 9 year old child. Although he's not very intelligent, his actions speak louder than words, and he shows up in numerous important historical events. The vast majority of the movie is told through flashbacks while he's sitting on a bench in Alabama in the 1980s. He tells people who sit next to him about his tragic (but also heroic) life story, starting with his childhood in the 1950s. Forrest explains how he was named after the famed southern civil war general Nathan Bedford Forrest, the only man in the whole war to be promoted all the way to general while starting out as a mere private. Forrest talks about how he had to have metal braces on his legs from a young age because of a physical disability, which actually inspired Elvis Presley's famous (somewhat vulgar) dance moves. As Forrest attends school for the first time, he meets a girl named Jenny (Robin Wright) who quickly becomes his one and only friend, as she is one of the only people to not mock him. As they grow up together, Forrest lives through more monumental events, such as meeting President Kennedy and seeing the first black students walk into an Alabama college. Eventually, things take a turn for the worst and Forrest is drafted into vietnam. While there, he meets his commanding officer, Lieutenant Dan, whose military heritage stretches back all the way to the war of independence. Vietnam proves to be a harrowing experience for Gump, who comes close to losing his life numerous times. He even runs back into a jungle to save his lieutenant from being burned to death after the area is marked for a napalm attack. However, all is not well because Lieutenant Dan survives, but loses both of his legs, leaving him a miserable invalid. At first, he hates Forrest for ""robbing him of an honorable death"", but the two come to respect each other. After the war ends in the 1970s, Forrest is sent home and lives with Dan in NYC for a while. Forrest invests in a relatively unknown little company (Apple Inc.) at the end of the 70s and gives much of the money to the family of Bubba, a soldier Forrest served alongside in vietnam. By now, Forrest no doubt misses Jenny, and runs all across the United States for years on end to keep his mind busy. Jenny, who had become a drug addict during the counterculture of the 60s, returns to Forrest and marries him in the early 1980s. Dan shows up at their wedding, revealing he has new prosthetic legs. Unfortunately, Forrest's marriage is very brief as Jenny reveals she has some kind of unknown virus (possibly hepatitis), and she dies the next year. Forrest visits her grave to say goodbye, and the movie ends with Forrest wishing his son good luck on his first day at school. I have to say, I was really impressed with this movie. I still think it's overrated, but not without plenty of good reasons. For one thing, it involves history, which is a good thing (for me). It also shows how lucky Forrest is, despite being unintelligent. He just so happened to live through all these famous events. I made an attempt to describe some of them, but there's a lot more. After Forrest gets wounded in vietnam, he meets the president (again) and shows his injury to LBJ. Another scene has him meeting Abbie Hoffman and giving a speech about why the war in vietnam is immoral. Because this movie is so long and contains so many different settings, it's quite hard to write about. It's just one of those experiences that can't really be put into words because unless you've seen it, you don't really understand. I just appreciated how it showed Forrest staying with his vietnam veteran friend all the way into the 80s, which often happened in real life. Of course, like many who came back from that conflict, Forrest gets disrespected upon arriving home for participating in what many considered organized murder. It was a big shock to me when I found out that Robert Zemeckis directed this, since I only knew about him from Back to the Future. As you might guess from a movie of this magnitude, the acting is all really well done. Tom Hanks won an oscar for his portrayal of Forrest, as he's much more than just an idiot. He's a patriot, warrior, father, and comrade. He has people who depend on him. Robin Wright as Jenny is probably the saddest thing about the movie, as she's one of the only people who appreciates Forrest, so seeing her die so early in their marriage was really terrible. The last major character (but definitely not least) is Lieutenant Dan, played by Gary Sinise. He reminds me a lot of stereotypical drill sergeant characters, since he's tough on the exterior, but he really cares about his men. He has few ways of showing it, and he's even initially hostile to Gump, but he later considers him his best friend for saving his life in southeast asia. Overall, Forrest Gump is a surprisingly emotional and sad movie, but it also has many funny aspects to it. I usually say that only the best movies can make an audience laugh, make them scared, or sad within only one film. In this case I really do think it's fitting.",

I didn't find this movie to be a masterpiece, but I thought that it was interesting how they did it. The title character (Tom Hanks) is of course a retarded Alabaman who grows up with his single mother (Sally Field). Throughout the movie, he plays a part in almost every major event of the post-WWII era, and in the process meets several distinguished personalities. All the while, he continues trying to get back together with his sweetheart Jenny Curran (Robin Wright Penn). Toeing the line between comedy (he shows his butt to LBJ) and drama (his friend Bubba gets killed in Vietnam), the movie never gets idiotic, although it was intermittently sappy.",

It's incredibly long, but it isn't boring for a second. The dialogues are all things at once, one moment they're fast-paced and hilarious and two seconds later they're slow and horrendously saddening. The way the plot develops is truly beautiful, because Forrest Gump is one of the greatest underdogs I've ever seen in a movie. You can't help but feel happy whenever he accidentally writes world history, or just when he misunderstands things yet again and shows his butt to the president.

It almost always generates discussion and is a cultural landmark in American cinema. I haven't yet gone in to a discussion like this, but should the moment arise, I will definitely defend it, as it is one of my all time favorites. The thing that always gets me is the innocence in which Forrest sees the world. He doesn't really know what he is doing or saying, yet to us he makes a huge difference in the world. On the other side of the coin, Jenny makes her own choices. Choices that lead to a complicated life and an ultimately predictable demise. Unlike other characters that seem to have a positive impact on Forrest's life, Jenny always seems to be the light in his life, despite being a completely dislikeable person at one point of the movie. Once again the naive Gump doesn't judge Jenny's bad decisions, as he still sees that lovely, but damaged young girl he met when he was a child.",

131,5 December 2017,Screen_Blitz,9," Forrest Gump is not just heartwarming, it is a triumphant cinematic work of art with Tom Hanks exercising the role of his career","Calling Forrest Gump may be saying a lot, but there is nearly impossible to deny the astounding talent roaring in front and behind the camera. Robert Zemeckis, a filmmaker with a heavenly gift of storytelling, take his talent to the fullest extent with this heartwarming, charm-fueled tale focuses on the eponymous fighting to find his place in the complex world many people struggle to understand. This movie, unraveled from the pages of the screenplay by Eric Roth, lightens the flame with cinematic mastery with storytelling that blends landmark American history with a timeless tale of a misunderstood man with the heart of gold. When you are supposed laugh, you will laugh. When you are supposed to cry, your eyes will get soaked; and that is only half of the beauty that makes this adaptation of Winston Groom's novel of the same name a triumphant piece of cinematic glitter. So this film stars Oscar- winner Tom Hanks as, yours truly, Forrest Gump, a forty-something year old Alabama man who suffers a low IQ but nonetheless carries a gentle soul. Providing the framework of the story is Forrest sitting on the park bench as he tells his story to various individuals of his life from his childhood, to his adult life where he caught in the middle of America's landmark moments including the meeting with President John F. Kennedy, to his tour in Vietnam where he forms friendship with his squadmate Lieutenant Dan (played by Gary Sinise), to the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. While caught up a series of political unrest that ran rampant during the 60s and 70s, he finds himself distracted in his pursue for his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran (played by Robin Wright) who's life is in shambles, while reflecting his life choices all of the wisdom of his mother (played by Sally Field).

Sound and Fury-esque story of idiot savant Hanks, not the sharpest tool in the shed but capable of some simple observations about living. And he gets to make a lot of observations across several decades of an eventful life, in a true tour de force by Hanks. Trick photography, placing Hanks with celebrities of the times, doesn't overshadow main tale of Hank's life-long romance with troubled Wright. Solid supporting cast is highlighted by Gary Sinise as injured Vietnam war buddy; look late for Sixth Sense's child star as Forrest's son. Detractors may be taking this movie too seriously, I don't think it means to be that pretentious. Few movies in the last 50 years are so simply and beautifully told; just sit back and enjoy the story and the soundtrack. P. S.

A lovely and warming film with Tom Hanks as the lead character telling the story of his life and how things have changed around him. Gump leads an extremely full life but despite everything he does; going to war, going for a long run, inventing crazes, playing sports, meeting presidents, catching shrimp - despite everything, all he wants to do is be reunited with his childhood sweetheart Jenny. It's fair to say that when life throws a problem, he just gets on with it and does his best, showing the audience that it's not worth being down about big things, not when life is so wonderful and varied. Hanks shines and is somehow hypnotic as Gump, grabbing the audience and taking them for a ride. Robin Wright (it's only ""The Princess Bride"" folks!!) is brilliant as Jenny, making you love her and hate her in equal amounts. I also must mention how good Gary Sinise was as Lieutenant Dan - like Jenny I hated him and loved him in equal amounts. His character development is brilliant and goes to highlight that anyone can change. Furthermore, one of the messages of the film (amongst all the others), a small interaction with somebody could have a lasting effect on them - that's how Dan turns out after having known Forrest Gump.",

Forrest Gump was born and raised in Alabama where he overcomes a walking disability, survives Vietnam, starts a shrimp business, plays football, and meets two Presidents. What is most interesting is its emphasis upon the historical elements through the limited understanding of Gump. Excellent work by director Robert Zemeckis whose impressive resume also includes such unique films as Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Remarkable work by Tom Hanks as Gump whose accomplishments never out weight his sense of devotion. Robin Wright plays Jenny who descends into drugs all the while denying the one man who has always sheltered her. Mykelti Williamson plays Vietnan buddy Bubba whose friendship with Gump would live on when a dream becomes a reality. Gary Sinise is commanding as Lieutenant Dan Taylor whose sense of duty is tested when Gump saves him thus opening other opportunities. Sally Field plays Gump's caring mother whose advice is carried on through memory. Sometimes unfairly depressing but demonstrates one's purpose to do great things. Score: 9 / 10",

He is running his childhood with his best and only friend Jenny (played by young Hanna Hall). His mom (played by Sally Field) teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to choose his own destiny. Then he goes to college and makes the football team while in college, and then goes to the army for the Vietnam War finding new friends Lt.

He wins medals and creates a shrimp fishing fleet, inspires people to jog, create a ping-pong craze, create the smiley, with bumper stickers and songs, donating to the people, and meeting the president several times. However it's all irrelevant to him when he can only think of his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran (played by Robin Wright).

The story is based on a novel, which explains the excellent structure of the plot but the directing was very competent in making this a moving, genuinely thought-provoking and interesting piece of art. It belongs in the category of long, drama films, but it never gets 'long' and the 'drama' never gets over-dramatic. The tension is excellently managed, the acting is very good, and in spite of its said long run-time the films is filled with events, meaningful characters and very good dialog, and it never concedes to self-complacency - objectively this is strong cinema through and through. True quality. The Gary Sinise character who represents the human ego, and Gump as a symbol that intelligence of the heart is infinitely superior and more valuable than intelligence of the mind. The only true concern for an easy-going, indulgent movie viewer is that the film builds such tremendous momentum, is so flawlessly told and crafted, that one would certainly expect an adequately superb finish, an emphatic ultimate exclamation point; not something extraordinarily life-changing but something rich in the same emotion and genuinely interesting/profound quality the whole film as a platform had built seamlessly for two hours plus. Such great classic stories end with a beautiful and fulfilling sense of utter satisfaction, and this does seem to fall slightly short of that, so it may not merit a full grade. ",

Despite his sub-normal IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for many of the most memorable events of the second half of the 20th century. Entirely without trying, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon.

When running continuously, you can see the end point or not see the end point. You are advancing as much as possible. Every time you encounter a post on the way, you can choose to pass by or Staying, each choice may lead to countless results, just like you cannot predict the taste of the next piece of chocolate, and every time you think, there may not be an answer. As in the doubts mentioned in the movie, do we each have their own destiny, or Like a feather, drifting in the wind. The time background of the film is modern America. Some details of the era are seen in many details of the film. Some historical events have been moved to the screen. The film can learn about the reputation of Forrest Gump, because in many historical events He was left in the middle. The story that was asked to be quoted during the filming process must be an event that actually happened, and all of this has been done realistically, including the editing of some shots, which are all materials that once existed. This is a very serious production. A-Gump almost ran a whole movie. He experienced life and death parting all his life, and ran through many places. Every time he stayed at a node, there was a small turning point in his life. This turning point would prompt him to continue running, as if Life can no longer stop. Every time he started his long-distance running, he must be wearing a blue and white plaid shirt and a khaki trousers, and later a cap and a pair of running shoes. These shoes have been in the movie for a few seconds. The close-up shot of has now become a fashion trend leader and has been loved by many friends. A-Gump also treated everything he insisted on with a serious attitude. He could even say that he had done two things of persistence and seriousness in his life, because these two things made him hit by mistake and reached many unexpected achievements. He did not feel any difference at all, because in his consciousness, he is himself, not others, his purpose is only to be himself, even if he does not understand how to be himself, he actually understands, in him After running through so many corners. Finally, when he sent his son to the school bus, the scene was like his own childhood. At this time, the child was wearing a blue and white plaid shirt, a red cap, and a familiar look. When the father and son were fishing together by the river, the son tilted his head to the left like A-Gump, this is the same gesture. The connection between them has been expressed through many lenses. Forrest Gump may want to convey his spirit to his son. He does not need to do a lot of homework because he is not very good at it, but he will give his son a subtle influence. Son In the future, he will become a person who possesses his character but is smarter than him. I believe it will bring greater honor to his father.",

197,20 April 1999,bnm81510,5, Worst Oscar Winner of the 90's,"A clear case of mass appeal prevailing over cinematic substance. The uber-conservative approach takes to US history is frankly misrepresentational at best. In a technique reminiscent of Woody Allen's ""Zelig"", the title character involves himself in all of the most famous events of the last forty years. Basically, the movie vilifies the protest movements of the 60's and preaches blissful ignorance under the apparently Gump-invented slogan: ""S**t happens"". Why create a hero who celebrates stupidity as a national characteristic is anyone's guess. Any true American patriot with an intelligence quotient above 75 would be deeply offended by the disservice the film does to our country. But even on a purely objective level,  ""Forrest Gump"" is deeply flawed. Not only does the film shamelessly borrow (or makes a very conspicuous ""homage"") from such masterpieces as ""Midnight Cowboy"", it is also poorly structured. Lacking any visible climax, it has a potential to end at any point during its third hour. Alas, it pointlessly drags on and on, as Tom Hanks gets into even more of his ""stupid"" adventures.",

Upon seeing it for the first time in a theater for the 25th anniversary screening, I was still astounded at the movie's timeless morals and sentiment. The movie really does not get old. It has its adult content so it may not be fit for kids, but I really believe this is a movie that holds broad appeal.

In order to enjoy it, you really have to suspend belief and politics when you press play. Most should find this easy, as the film never attempts to seem realistic. Forrest starts as a mentally challenged reject with a positive, happy-go-lucky approach to life, and this approach eventually makes him incredibly successful. The wild events he finds himself in may be far-fetched, but they serve perfectly as a contrast between the success of being positive and the failure of self pity. Forrest never gets down on himself, and this eventually rubs off on those around him.

The movie's music wasn't helpful at all could have added more greatness to the scenes. The rhythm of the movie slowed at some parts and was quick at others but the only thing that bothers is that a character like Forrest after all of that could have been used better and had better situations and more effective and I really thought of it as a great performance by Hanks although I don't feel most of the scenes were the ones that could show us the character and make it way more epic but you will be taken by hank's performance which was the spine of the movie. His love Jenny I suppose wasn't that serious character that fits to guide him or help him and should have been another character that makes that great effect in his life. The telling of the story and camera movements were absolutely gorgeous and Robert Zemeckis did a great job in it along side with the scenario which reflected the characters so well.In the end a great movie! 8.5/10,

Secondary, ""True love"". I could see true love from this movie. Even if you see your feelings to the one you love impossible love, continue to care. That love would come true trult someday.
Finally, ""Continuing to challenge untill the end"". If you challenged something untill the end without giving up, your dream would come true though there would be a lot of walls you would face at. What I could see from this movie was ""Never give up"".",

Instead it pushes every button imaginable to jerk a reaction out of the viewer, and tries to dictate your emotions with a pushy music score. The movie lapses into silliness at times, and is self-indulgent for the last hour. Director Robert Zemeckis attempts to evoke each era by illustrating its clichés and by scoring it to a procession of over-familiar songs that serve as lazy, embarrassingly obvious signifiers of their times (Sweet Home Alabama, Hound Dog, Blowin' in the Wind, California Dreamin', For What it's Worth, On the Road Again, Mrs. Robinson, etc.).

329,5 April 2020,Pierre-Andre-17,10, The Running Soul,"I have to say that Forrest Gump is the movie which serves as a milestone in my life because of its special and unbelievable inspirational power...
I watched the movie when I was during the winter holiday in Grades 11... Before that time...I was like most ordinary students who wasted time on playing computer games and unhealthy videos... I didn't have a dream at that time... I didn't have perseverance at that time... And I didn't have confidence and always be stirred by the others at that time... All in all...I was a loser who forgot he used to be competitive in his childhood...who forgot that his parents loved him a lot but didn't he hid into the room playing games...who despoiled his talent but was not conscious of anything...-That is the context of me at that time...
By accident... the Fortuna even favored me ...who was a pariah ...just when I need her most... My mom sent me to talk with a talented student who had matriculate with MIT... Originally...we were aimed at sharing math-learning experience and I would wait for his advice...however...he ... a brilliant and prospective one...expressed his aspiration for me and urged me to think more about the world outside...which sowed a special seed in my heart... After that talk ...I asked my parents to buy a English-learning book for me and decided to master English...
Though I did work hard at that time...my heart still suspended as I missed computer games and sensory appetite... I was so confused like Pierre Bezkhov when I had to choose only one from sensory satisfaction and my prospective future... Without urge and enough perseverance ...I trespassed my rule over and over again though every time I decided to"" overhaul myself... Though I had an ideal...I didn't own strong heart to defend it... -that is my second phase...
Accidentally...I watched Forrest Gump with my parents in a evening as a so-called recreation... We escorted ourselves in the sofa and waited for watching funny things...However...what I heard was not laugh in the prelude... what I heard was not hilarious actions in the prelude-what I heard was an euphonious and soft music which made me feel I was the feather drifting with wind without knowing the destiny and touched my heart-string powerfully...
...
That was the first time that I watched a movie till 1:00am... After the 142mins watching ... I turned off the TV seemingly silent but a special power rose in my heart meanwhile... That was the first time in my life that I was touched so completely by a movie... Laying on the bed...I thought Forrest has small dream but also trys his best to defend it ... Why can't I? He doesn't care anyone's scoff and doesn't be affected by others'perverse...Why can't I? He loved Jenny truly madly and deeply and deemed her his beacon faithfully...Why can't I own this faith towards my dream? It's time for me to have a run with Forrest in my heart...
I grasped this invaluable chance and discarded my old habits decisivly ... finished the English book at an amazing speed ... I liked reading English books in the corridor and on the way to my home ... I also run to my home after school so that I can save some time to learn Engish-I know this foreign language can take me anywhere ...
With the inspiration left by the movie ... I successfully passed more and more exams and is still on the way to my ideal university-Cornell ... Though it's hard to achieve my dream Forrest Gump is still my sword and shield which will make me stir clear off the obstacles and find the best way...
I am still running and Forrest ... I hope everyone can do...",
330,27 April 2019,CinematicGarbage,6, One of the greatest dramas I've ever seen!,"Forrest Gump (1994) is one of the greatest Oscar Winning Movies. It won Best Picture, Best VFX, Best Director (Robert Zemeckis), Best Actor (Tom Hanks) and Best Film Editing. It was one of the best films I have ever seen.
Forrest Gumps casted Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, Robin Wright as Jenny Curran, Gary Sinises as Lieutenant Dan Taylor and more. First of all, the acting was extremely excellent, Tom Hanks could act like a stupid guy and he actually won an Oscar for that. It was really impressive.
The story was really good. Starting the time when there was president John F. Kennedy and there was was in Vietnam (my country, it made me so proud of having Vietnam in such a good movie). It was an Alabama man with an IQ of 75. I could imagine that being Forrest Gump was the greatest thing. Bullied, called stupid is fine, many people though it would make you an outcast.
This was such a good movie that some day I want to see it again and again and again. The scenes are really unforgettable with humor and tragedy. I laughed and cried (whenn Jenny and Bubba are dead). It was the most unforgettable movie ever.
Well, I had nothing left to say. Forrest Gump is a must-see. A 9.4/10",

I've always liked how the film took a look at a simple person's life and a simple person who is always in very big situations yet never really understands it. There are countless bits of dialogue that are remembered by mans and they've entered the public IQ but the one dealing with knowing what love is is the one that always caught my attention as far as what this film is about. To me Gump goes through all these historic things yet it's always his love for Jenny that is the heart of the picture.,

Hanks is absolutely magnificent, his character is fantastic !! After watching this film, I really think Tom Hanks could be the next DiCaprio !! He can act so dramatic at one minute, the other minute he can be so hilarious you won't believe how excellent he can act !! Also, every character works. I won't spoil anything but even if something happens to a curtain character and you don't cry, you'll still think the actor did a great job portraying the character. This film deserves 10/10, it's impossible to feel bored in this movie, every second you can either laugh hysterically, feel so invested in the story and the dialog, or even cry when something sad happens.

You know, I think a child or maybe the unintelligent people have their own view that mostly people haven't. And, that's one cause that make this movie so special. About the acting, yes, Tom Hanks did outstanding act, that makes me thought that Tom Hanks is really Forrest Gump. The way he speaks or walks were very different from other Tom Hanks' movies. The first time I watch the movie, I even think that Forrest Gump is real. And after I read many reviews and FAQ, I know that Forrest Gump just a fictional-character of baby-bomber generation.

This piece of sublime seventh art also makes us think and reflect about gratitude, justice, loyalty, dignity, honor and benevolence.

Because they can be well prepare for the opportunities and challenges and even know the lucky numbers of lottery beforehand. But for me, I don't want to have such 'ability' at all. Life is a mystery and everyone has his own way. I enjoy the surprise of receiving gift from my classmates on my birthday and running into an old friend on the street in another city, etc. There are so many amazing incidents in my life which can't be happen if I have the power to forecast the future.
To Forrest Gump, who was born with intellectual disturbance and muscle problem in his leg, he never imagined that he could become a famous American football player, a war hero and even a millionaire. Forrest won dignity and respect though his strive and perseverance.
I believe I can make a better life for those I love though my own effort. Have a little faith for your life. Let's enjoy our life everyday with dignity, honesty, braveness and love just like Forrest Gump!",

346,26 March 2020,dabeluoki,9, The Greatest Movie of all time.,"Forrest Gump is a story that follows two characters, one names Forrest, the other named Jenna.
As  says Forrest Gump is a simple relatively wealthy kid man with a low I.Q, but good intentions. What makes this move so great is how Gump goes through many of the historical events of the 20th century. From dancing with Elvis, to entering the Vietnam war, to witnesses the original moon landing on tv, to meeting the black panther organization, and even even witnessing the WaterGate Scandal that causes Nixon to retire. Gump goes through a lot of situations throughout his life, but he never lets anyone of them disturb his happiness. From we're wearing braces on his leg, to get in bullied in school, and as an adult, to even being shot. Gump never gives up and continues to believe things will workout all right. That faith always helps him out for example when he gets his braces of he discovers he can run extremely fast, and long, all that running from bullies paid off (insert famous Run Forrest Run Here scene here). Not only that because he runs so fast Football recruiters and coaches notice him allowing him to receive a football scholarship to the university of Alabama as a running back. Which then allows him to graduate college and join the military when a recruiter talks to him. Why he joins the military no reasons he just does it no real explanation to why.
That's the thing with his character he basically symbolizes the idea that somebody can make a difference no matter who they are, even the dumbest of the dumb. When he joins the military, he quickly able to fit, you realize Forrest really isn't that dumb. He able to quickly able to reassemble his gun in the military, faster than anyone in the U.S military existence.
Anyway in the military he meets a man named Bubba and he comes the best of pals. Despite racism clearly being an issue as shown by the historical scene of the desegregation of the university of Alabama(extremely funny). Bubba and Him are quickly able to become the best of friends. To the point where the the Shrimp business he always talks with Forrest about, he eventually ask Forrest to come join him once's they leave the military. Which is sad cause Bubba ends up dying due to an injury.",

When I started watching this movie. I thought it will be a motivatinal movie and not much entertaining. But, in few minutes, the outlook changes to a romance genre. And then, in no time, it will be a comedy movie. It changes to action, war, a bit of sports and what not. Then, it was just oscillating between all genres and finally creates it own outstanding genre.
Story writing for such movie and direction needs a distinguished talent. This movie tells us about so many values in life.
Gump's mom beleiving and also making sacrifices to get her son to mainstream even when everyone is writing him off as stupid, making him believe that he is equally capable are so meaningful. It establishes Gump's character. He learns to ignore distractors and abusers and just concentrates on his work. Excels in what he is strong at and also remains grounded at the same time.

368,20 April 2020,DemonKiki,10," When I'm in a bad mood, I will watch this movie","Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what the next one is. Therefore, all we have to do is learn how to taste, instead of complaining about ourselves and exile.
This is where A-Gump's impressiveness lies. He actually has faith. Faith in life, ""Life is like a box of all kinds of chocolates, you will never know what the next one is""; for your determination, when Jenny asked him what he wanted to become in the future, A-Gump only The answer is, ""I will still be myself in the future""; when judging the choice, when someone asks him, are you a fool? Forrest Gump's answer is still simple and profound, because ""only people who do stupid things are fools.""
In addition to the linguistic presentation of A-Gump's beliefs, there is also a moving presentation in the film, which is ""running"". From A-Gump's childhood, running has become A-Gump's life and part of his life. Running made A-Gump free from the foot support, ran across the rugby field, ran through the Vietnam War, and ran across the continent. Behind everything is obviously metaphorical. Running symbolizes the endless life, the firm direction, and the perseverance of the goal. Every step is contagious. Therefore, I think that running is not a kind of consumption, but acquisition, and you will feel that you are more powerful and will not fall into sinking, depravity and confusion. In particular, A-Gump started a three-year running journey after Jenny left.
However, faith always conflicts with certain things, such as fate. What this actually brings is the contradiction between consciousness and reality, the unity of inevitability and chance. In the film, the appearance of feathers almost expresses this kind of entanglement. Feather is drifting in the wind and is helpless, but it has its final destination and dependence. For A-Gump, the biggest joke that fate opened to him was that his best friends, loved ones and lovers all left him one after another. God let him taste the best emotions in the world and let him be lost by loved ones. pain. It's like A-Gump's confession in front of Jenny's grave: I don't know that when we have a destiny, it's not just accidents in life, like floating in the wind, or both.
When faith was hit by fate, A-Gump did not give up on it. This does not affect my judgment that Forrest Gump's life and life are happy. Because the essence of happiness is that you know what you have, no matter whether it is or now, you know that their position and value in your heart are irreplaceable. You know how to cherish, you will not forget them, nor will they. Because, when you have a certain faith, you will move towards your path, you will not be disturbed, you will have a free will, a beautiful heart and noble thoughts and firm actions. This is what A-Gump did, not only to understand but to do it. Since it is right, why not act immediately? Only doing stupid things is a fool! Therefore, A-Gump can reach the other side of happiness and have a paradise of true love.",

""Forrest Gump"" is the story of a man from Alabama with a low I.Q., whose personality is different from others, but ends up achieving many goals including football, Vietnam, shrimping, table tennis, etc. The story has words spoken by the beautiful writing of Eric Roth, and it was magically directed by Robert Zemeckis. The amazing visual effects were added to plant Tom Hanks in historical landmarks, which makes that kind of movie, a magical movie. The film had a brilliant cast involving Gary Sinise, Robin Wright, Sally Field, and the incredible Tom Hanks as the witted Forrest, himself. The movie was an incredible look of being different while being special, and never knowing what to do in life cause it just happens to you without knowing. That's why I respect this excellent film. This is one of my all-time favorite movies for a reason. It had a terrific cast, it had heart, it meant something, it was entertaining, and it was also quite incredible. A movie like this deserves to be recognized as a excellent movie. Next to ""Titanic"", ""Forrest Gump"" is my second favorite movie of all time. I enjoyed the hell out of everything, and my heart always feels special every time I watched. This is an amazing motion picture, no doubt about it. It's just a shame that nobody can respect the movie's Best Picture Oscar win objectively. Like my Mama always says, ""life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get"".

The off putting message IS in fact that you can be an idiot and be successful, and in fact suggests that it might be better to be so.

392,18 December 2006,miaoyabo,10, What a movie!,"I lived in China and in 1995 when I was still a high school student, I watched this movie for its reputation  won several Oscar. Honestly I felt bored when I was watching the movie that time because I could hardly understand the meaning of the movie and could hardly feel its beauty. At that time, only ""The Terminator"" kind of movies was able to attract me. After I watched it for the second time now after 11 years, I felt quite moved by almost all the elements this movie carries, the story, quotes, special effect, Tom Hank's perfect portray of Forrest Gump and most importantly, Forrest's deepest innate world. It's not easy to conclude what kind of person Gump is and what are the meanings and inspiration this fictitious character conveys to all the viewers. But I do have the strongest inspiration from this movie, that is, people can really get somewhere to achieve something not only because they have a lot of good qualities, more importantly, from what we see on Forrest Gump, because of not having a lot of bad qualities, or innate weakness of human beings, or various interferences around everybody. You can see all those bad qualities, weaknesses and interferences from the lives of Lt. Dan and Jenny who are normal or seemingly smart persons. On the contrary, Forrest is a person with low IQ and was thought of by many people as moron. Yes, Forrest is not smart and he knows it quite well. But for me, exactly because of his being not so smart, he doesn't have those bad things that other normal persons have that prevent them from achieving what Forrest was able to achieve. Those people have too many thoughts sometimes, or too much expectation, or too much depression in face of setbacks and all those things are actually interferences to the normal people that prevent them from staying focused for a long time. Now I should be looking at myself and asking myself, what kind of interferences I should remove from myself to really get somewhere. Thanks, Forrest Gump, thanks, this fabulous movie that sheds so much light on me.",

""Forrest Gump"" definitely is a film very suited for children with much of its not too subtle humour and you can recognize that it is generally made for a large, large audience with all its political correctness and clean showing of sexuality (I mean you can't offend anyone, can't you?). The background sound is provided by a huge amount of popular classics of the time. It's also funny how the film connects different historical occasions and persons and weaves them into the overall story, what makes a big part of the films charm. This film has heart, that's why I still like it, although there are some negative qualities that are reaching surface more and more for me.

This is a brilliant movie...it is full of wisdom and simple truths. Recently, some of the top physicists in the world have seriously questioned if intelligence is a good thing. The only things on earth that like intelligence are home sapiens...and they invented it. The dinosaurs were not intelligent, yet ruled the world for 150 million years. Modern man has ruled the world for only a little over 200,000 years, and with all his ""intellegence"" has made a very bad job of looking after the planet. Homo sapiens probably have very little time left here on earth. When we meet Forrest Gump (brilliantly played by Tom Hanks) he is a young boy. He has an I.Q. of 75. When he is a man he functions like a man with an I.Q. of about 85---88. His simplicity gives him implicit honesty and a foundation of pure goodness. Things always appear to go right for Gump and after a stint in the Vietnam war, he becomes a very rich man. Religion, mysticism and and the political process are three of many things that Forrest cant understand. But he is a banner holder for that dying human behaviour.....common decency. There are other fundamentally simple messages in this great movie. As a piece of entertainment it is magnificent. As a lesson to us all on how we should live...it is spiritual.

When the film came out, it was truly breathtaking. It showed that the great and talented Tom Hanks can perform anything. Had this film been released a year before? He would have probably have gotten his first Academy Award for Best Actor. Truthfully, his role in Philadelphia was good but not Forrest Gump. We don't really remember much of the role in the previous film except that he played a Philadelphia attorney dying of AIDS and suing for justice for his termination. While the film, Philadelphia is good. It's not Forrest Gump. What separates Forrest Gump from Philadelphia is that there is so much more going on around the character. I think it's a shame that Sally Field did not get an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for playing his mother and Robin Wright also did not get a nomination for Best Supporting ACtress for playing the love of FOrrest's life. They were some of the best female performances of that year alone. When you hear the music or the soundtrack, you are reminded of the some of the most memorable moments in movie history of a truly remarkable character named Forrest Gump.

It has everything, comedy, romance, tragedy, and spans the globe in this epic fiction tale that ties in with real world events. The music has to be the best in any movie ever. It's moral is great too, it's about a man who wasn't given anything and had to fight for everything. He came from almost nothing and became the most influential and morally upright person ever born. He is everything I wish I could be, the greatest man to ever walk to the Earth. The Dos Equis guy doesn't have anything on Forrest Gump. Forrest is the most interesting man in the world, just ask the people at that bus stop.

436,19 April 2007,newday98074,9, Hollywood,"at its best. When blockbusters work they do so through creating an alternate universe near enough to find our emotions while effecting magical art, beauty and experience. Forrest Gump is a shining example of that clarity. Hanks' performance is so natural that no wheels can been seen turning, astonishing when compared to Rain Man, the several iterations of ""Of Mice and Men"", and a myriad other movies where low IQ individuals are portrayed. Hanks brings to Gump dignity and individuality that allows us to love him without sympathy for his condition. All the supporting actors play off this lead wonderfully, without exception. The result is a fantasy as heartfelt as any in my experience. A truly wonderful film.",

He was sitting in Savannah On a bench in the state, the passersby who were waiting for the bus in the same seat kept telling the story of their life.

442,2 April 2020,q-02121-71714,9, warm and powerful,"Forrest Gump almost finished a whole movie, his life went through life and death, but also ran through a lot of places, every time he stayed at a node, life will have a small turn, this turn will prompt him to continue to run, as if life can no longer stop. Every time he starts his long run, he must be wearing a blue and white plaid shirt and a pair of khaki trousers, followed by a cap and running shoes, which had a close-up shot for several seconds in the movie and have become a fashion trendsetter and loved by many friends.
In fact, it is very rare for a mother to have such a consciousness of life, and everything she bears in her life is also relatively heavy. As a single mother, she raised her son alone, and the obstacles her son suffered because of intellectual reasons need to be ruled out by her.-personally, she bears the expenses of her child's growth and takes good care of a child, all of which is on her one person, but she is still optimistic and upward, and at the same time she teaches her son to be optimistic and upward. It is believed that a fool has such a thing, so the mother is actually a good example of a firm belief in a willing heart all the way, and Jenny is a key to the lock of his bondage.
Forrest Gump's biggest characteristic is his persistence and seriousness. In fact, insisting on itself is a very difficult thing to complete, but someone will still do it, just like Forrest Gump. He has been running, his life is to run, from the beginning of being chased, to run on his own, he has no other distractions in his heart, he has no interest in the purpose, he was asked by Jenny who wants to be a person, he did not understand, he said he is not to be himself.
Forrest Gump also took everything he insisted on with a serious attitude, and it could even be said that he had done both persistence and seriousness in his life, because these two things had led him to make many unexpected achievements by mistake, and he did not feel any difference at all, because in his consciousness, he was himself, not others, and his purpose was to be himself, even if he did not understand how to do himself well. But he actually understood, after he ran through so many corners.",

I laughed, I cried, I got mad, I got excited. I just could feel anything because this movie puts our loved Forrest trough so many situations you wouldn't imagine.

He is the All-American guy. It made you feel you were there in 60s when we landed on the moon, when Richard Nixon robbed the Watergate, and when African-American were making the mark on America. However despite it's emotional and innocent events it had some moments like whe Jenny (god bless her soul even though she had done wrong) was a prostitute, when JFK, George Wallace, Lennon, and more were shot, and even when Forrest's mom had to sleep with a school principal so Forrest could make it in life brang out the dark and dirty points of our nation and leaves feeling a little guilty for how society is.

In such a dramatic movie, it's amazing that it can still be so funny- or, in a comedic movie, it's amazing that it can still be so dramatic. The shots of war are brilliant, and it's easy to believe that the action is real. Tom Hanks played Forrest as well as he acted in any movie, and Sally Field did not get enough respect for her performance.

Every character, not just Gump, is walking through this movie with no goal, no destination, and no clue, as to what the other characters are doing.  Someone off-screen must've just shouted ""move"" over and over again, and then filmed the result.  Gump goes here.  Gump goes there.  Sally Field says this.  Sally Field dies.  And so on.

One of the most notable reasons being Hank's acting. Whether you be older and gray or on the younger side, his acting is something people of any age can appreciate. His dedication to his roles, specifically this one stands out on a level which is highly noticeable. He brings to life Forrest Gump, and with that the tear jerking scenes, and awe and reverence that comes with this movie. Phenomenal, timeless, classic. May it continue be replayed for years to come.",

498,1 October 2009,johnmschofield,10, This film is a simple tale of goodness and keeping in the light,"I have only seen this film once but once was enough for me. This film is a simple tale of goodness and light and how somebody can shine that light on those less fortunate. Religion is not involved here at least not in the conventional sense. The light is the sheer goodness of a person who clearly cannot do or say anything to offend anybody no matter how hard some people disrespect or try to offend them. In the case of the man in the title role this is not an attitude that he adopts to win favour or even artificial posturing in order to be popular, it is who he is. There are people out there who will feed on the mans positivity or goodness and hope by association to be renewed or to have some beneficial effect rub off on them. And so Forrest goes through life as if the world holds no surprises or perhaps everything is a surprise, so when they come along he just adapts without any fuss and just moves on. People like Forrest are rare indeed and the film which charts his life is uncomplicated and just lays it out for all to see. The entire cast and crew are to be congratulated on a very good job as the film in the wrong hands could have been a disaster. I would highly recommend anybody watch this film at least once, because for me it has a very simple message and is also very entertaining.",

The flick really is a roller coaster of emotions, running the gamut from genuinely funny to genuinely sad, sometimes within the same scene. It's all held together by tight filmmaking that knows exactly what it's doing, ultimately creating perhaps one of the most entertaining, affecting and crowd-pleasing experiences ever put to screen.

Millions of people went to see it in theaters, and adored the lovable main character; Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump later received six academy awards (including best picture and actor), and was even ranked as one of the hundred best American films of all time by the AFI. I pose a question to you, the reader; is something wrong with me? Because Forrest Gump, in my eyes, is, possibly, one of the hundred WORST movies that I've ever seen. Forrest Gump boasts a FAIR performance by Tom Hanks, starring as the title role. That, perhaps, is the best part of this movie, and it was only par. In terms of the story, which could be the worst part of this movie, it is completely pointless. It may be entertaining to watch, but, in the end, it is two and a half hours of a retard (75 I.Q.) prospering in life. This could be a really great movie, but there was no struggle involved. Forrest Gump simply had life and all of his achievements come rushing towards him. Forrest Gump advertises the idea that you can just slide through life effortlessly; that is not true.

It was as though society was sucking up to trash. I don't care who puts this movie up as something it is fact not worth watching, as most of it was boring, not very entertaining and certainly not funny. There's nothing interesting about a nerdy Peter Pan adult whose stupidity can easily be taken advantage of. I see nothing morally right about someone showing their bare buttocks. I got the impression that whoever came up with this concept really didn't have any good ideas and just slap this together to throw at the audience, just to make a buck. There's nothing worse than insulting the audience intelligence. The only drama in it is the unpredictability of what this wacko character would do while loose in the community.

Quite how the marketeers managed to pass this off as a great film is beyond my powers of reason. Tom Hanks plays the intellectually challenged Gump and picked up his second consecutive Oscar for his over the top portrayal. A spectacular job considering the Academy do not normally fall for the same ploys as the movie going public. Even more spectacular when you consider that Morgan Freeman was nominated for The Shawshank Redemption. Gump was the Best Film winner as well, even though Pulp Fiction AND The Shawshank Redemption were nominated. I would put this film into the same sort of class as the Wonder Years or Dazed and Confused, nice but nothing special. It's little more than a period piece chronicalling American Life across three decades and how it affected one man, namely Mr Gump. The cast is good with Gary Sinise very good as Gump's Vietnam Sergeant. Sally Field is well cast as Gump's mother, beyond that there is not much to redeem Gump, the effects are very nicely added if nothing new and the soundtrack is predictably well chosen given the period of time it covers. For the most part it's too mushy, way too sentimental and just not much above mediocre.

In Gump's life, he must overcome many obstacles, which he does in a way we might call a wonder. The movie is a literary adaptation of the eponymous book by author Winston Groom. In our opinion, the movie is a must for everybody interested in films. It convinces with its great story, its humor and the love with which it was made. Historical events are indicated and changed in an amusing way. For the most part, the look is kept simple, but in some scenes - like the one with former US-president John F. Kennedy - the video editing exceeded everything imaginable at this time (1994). Other points why the film is close to perfect are the music, the message and, last but not least, the incredible performance of main actor Tom Hanks.

The constant pop culture references, and Forrest's appearances in just about every last hallmark moment of his generation, act as both a blessing and a curse. They represent a majority of the film's enduring identity, with a certain amount of charm attributed to the seamy, not-quite-there execution of the archival footage, but it's often a case of too much of a good thing. His silly contributions during the continent-spanning run that seals the second act are particularly egregious - good for a very quick snort, but ultimately damaging to the story at large. It's got a big, heavy heart though, and that carries it a long way. Tom Hanks, of course, is to thank for a great deal of that, but Gary Sinise is almost just as good in his cigar-chomping, world-loathing, hat-hanging support role as Lieutenant Dan. A one-of-a-kind classic that may have been just a smidge overrated at the time it was released, its cornerstone scenes still hold up very well and the classic cast of characters may as well be family at this point.",

When you've seen it before, you don't concentrate so much on the special effects putting Hanks into historical footage. Some of those effects were better than others, but it was a really cute trick. The best effects, however were the computer removal of Gary Sinise's legs. I watched closely and this was absolutely seamless, looked perfect on the screen.

It appeared to me that the theme was that it didn't matter if you were an idiot, things would work out fine so long as you are American and your hearts is pure. Some time after seeing the movie I read extracts from the original book which was clearly of more satirical intent.

Its beauty is the simplicity with which the story is told through the eyes of a simple and unassuming character. As a character Forrest is difficult not to like and many can understand and even relate to him. This is a film that transcends a single plot as it showcases many important events in American history that Forrest experiences. The pace is simply brilliant as it does not slow down at any certain time period, it moves fast enough for the viewer to appreciate it. Through Gump's living in the moment and unassuming character this film conveys volumes about humanity and how simple values like kindness and respect really matter. Forrest values the key people in his life.",
553,3 April 2020,k-08062,9, Flying feathers,"I often talk about Forrest Gump with my friends. Forrest Gump is so lucky! That's what my friends always say. I was dumb. I was surprised that Forrest Gump was sitting on that stool, just telling strangers coming and going: ""look, how lucky I am""? Many years ago, I was full of confusion about life. I don't know why people live. Sometimes I sit on the windowsill and say to myself: I'm jumping now, it's no different from living to death. Fortunately, I didn't jump. After thinking about it for two years, I came up with an answer: how can people live better? Although there is no answer to this question, I am not as confused as before. Why are you talking about this? Because when watching this film, I seem to have experienced the process of questioning life again. A normal person has the ability to judge. He knows what is important and what is not. A normal person can have many choices, so he is always biding his time. A normal person will not waste his energy on useless places. But Forrest Gump is not a normal person, his IQ is lower than ordinary people, he even almost entered a school for the mentally handicapped. Girlfriend, school team, army, ping-pong, shrimp farming, running, it seems that everything about him is not his own choice, but the choice of others. Of course, he doesn't ask questions like ""what is life?"" He will only foolishly do one thing after another. What exactly is this story about? I think the director said a truth in a very extreme way: choice is likely to mislead life. Because there are too many choices, some people do not work attentively, this attitude further affects his life. In the face of life, maybe you should be prepared: ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you don't know which one you will choose."" I like this film very much. I like the feather flying very much, as if it was myself.",

I believe, talking with John Lennon, and actually my first impression was that it was forced, and contrived. Corny. So, I never really watched the whole film, until a year or two ago. This movie brings so many tears to my eyes, not because of sadness, but because of the simplicity of life, relationships, and different stories. The little feather in the beginning of the film seems to be on a journey visiting different lives, and by the end of the story, when the little feather moves on on it's path, you are so touched and moved by the beautiful story of Forrest Gump.",

560,9 September 2010,jbspurr,1," Young dolt is showered with unmerited and unachieved blessings demonstrating that ""ignorance is bliss""—Not","""Forrest Gump"" professes to be all about innocence, but is certainly the most pernicious highly popular movie of my lifetime, whose subtext is the message that there is something virtuous about invincible ignorance, which will be rewarded in all sorts of improbable and arbitrary ways. An exercise from beginning to end in magical thinking, the movie undermines the manifest fact that achievements in life should and must be earned, and that understanding proceeds from knowledge, which must, in turn, be gained through education, the broader the better. ""Forrest Gump"" was the perfect vehicle for the reactionary Reagan era, with its ""what me worry"", feel-good-about-America message, regardless of what we were (and are) doing, and however much suffering we may countenance or cause (whether in Vietnam, Chile, Guatemala, El Salvador, Angola, or Iraq, then or now). The movie was also a major piece of propaganda in the then new revisionism regarding the Vietnam War that began under Reagan, depicting anti-war activists as the perfect fit for that most tenacious of ""urban legends"", the spat upon veteran (the only people who spat upon the veterans were the Johnson and Nixon regimes that put them in harm's way, and then dumped them on the streets without providing any transitional or sustained support before PTSD was fully acknowledged as a consequence of trauma in combat). This movie is also a perfect fit for the kind of know-nothing nativism expressed by the likes of Sarah Palin and the ""Tea Party"" movement, and thus a sad commentary on the present condition of life in America as well. It is not a ""Candide"" for our time.",

619,11 May 2014,jbirls21,9, The best film in history,"Tom Hanks, hands down, gives one of the best performances by any actor. Ever. Forrest Gump is such a compelling, historically based, dramatic and even light hearted film that I believe is the greatest film of all time. Gary Sinise, or Lt. Dan, definitely should have won for Best Supporting Actor. He plays a man with no legs for more than half of the movie and he is such a harrowing character at large. Moreover, Forrest Gump, undoubtedly, has some of the best lines in movie history (Run Forrest Run, Life is like a box of chocolates, etc), but the morality behind the film is incredible. Forrest Gump, when he runs across the country for literally no reason, is such an inspirational moment in the film. What I enjoy most about Forrest Gump is that he unwittingly gets caught up in some of the most key moments in the 20th century. Watergate, Kennedy, Civil Rights, Vietnam, Alabama Football - he's there. And because Forrest is such a simple man, these scenes are that much more captivating. An absolute 10/10, Forrest Gump, driven by the once-in-a-lifetime performance by Tom Hanks, followed by a forceful performance by Gary Sinise, is the greatest film in history in my opinion. If you haven't watched it, you are missing out big time. Myself, it is one of those few movies that never gets old. Fantastic every time.",

The plot might have been a little shaky and it might have dragged on a little bit but it was so good and so loaded with drama and adventure it didn't bother me at all that it dragged on a little. The people I know who didn't like it didn't like it mainly because they thought it went a little overboard with all his achievements but I think it was to bring out some important things in history and what a way to do it. By sticking a made up character through it all. It got my attention. I love the soundtrack to. I day before I saw this I had said Tom Hanks was a bad actor boy did those words come back to haunt me.

Tom Hanks gives life to Forrest Gump, the movie's owner. It is still one of the best drama movies, even after many years since the film was released. Forrest Gump has a 75 IQ rating, a bit behind normal people, but it's actually a character that does what most people can't. While watching Forrest's story, I am sure that most viewers have a smile on their face. Although the movie is a drama movie, it can make people laugh. He also makes an effort to get the girl he loves. The movie contains both action, comedy and drama. A movie that everyone should watch. While some parts are absurd, everyone should watch.

Forrest is so likeable and the filmmakers even succeed in making some humorous parts which is not normal in most dramas.

I was very disappointed when it received an academy award. The movie was supposed to be inspiring, but it's hard for me to be inspired when there's so little that's recognizable about a character. I think the reason the box of chocolates line was quoted so much was that that was all that was memorable about the movie. One ""effect"" that I especially disliked was the technique whereby Forrest Gump was included in old footage. In addition, I found myself worrying about Sally Field's career.

His classic ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" quote is one heard many times over, that everyone has quoted a few times in their life. The fact that is now a collection of stores in the US, Bubba Gumps, based from this movie, shows just how big of a film it is.

647,5 May 2017,stormhawk2021,10, Excellent!!,"Converted into a classic of the 90's and for me in a classic of all time, Forrest Gump is a story that marvels, excites, amuses all types of public. It tells the story of the United States through a poor backward named Forrest who is involved in the great events that have occurred in the ""country of opportunity"", with a realistic look at the Vietnam War and other more fantastic ones such as The birth of large companies (such as Apple). But what most envelops me is the background story of love, with an almost unreachable Jenny, which keeps the viewer on the verge of tears in several scenes. (Exciting when he asks for marriage) Notable performances, Hanks was born for this role, great is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan, plus special effects first hand, necessary to be able to tell us the dynamic and fun story of North America seen through Forrest's eyes. There are phrases that are immortalized such as ""Run Forrest, Run !!!!"", ""Jenny and I was like peas and carrots"" or ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to play .."", make this movie a masterpiece of cinema of all time.",

Of course.  But through all these things that you could that would make this sound like an awful movie, there is one thing that you cannot deny.  This movie moved people.  Told from the naive and Simple-minded Gump, it trawls through Vietnam, the US Hippy Age, and numerous events at the Whitehouse, showing that Gump has had a far more interesting life  than he would ever let on.  It is essentially a love story, as he continues in his mission to win over his childhood sweet heart.  It is told completely in flash back until the last few minutes, and as a brilliant Tom Hanks unravels the story for his audience, delivering line after line of unknowing yet amazingly poignant statements, you sort of realise just how good it was to be totally ignorant things.  Maybe this movie was not as great as everyone said it was. In realisation, it did not deserve the heap of Oscars it got.  But for two hours, this innocent guy reminded us what it was like to be youthful in mind, totally free of cynicism. And I for one, have got no problem whatsoever with that. *****",

661,4 June 2020,l-64317-97959,6, Every year will see,"I often talked about Forrest Gump with my friends. Lucky Forrest Gump! That's what friends always say. I am dumb to. I wondered if Forrest, sitting on that stool, was telling strangers coming and going, ""Look how lucky I am!""
Some years ago, I was confused about life. I don't know why people live. Sometimes I sat on the window sill and said to myself: It is no different for me to jump now than it is for me to live till I die. Fortunately, I didn't jump. Think for two years, I came up with an answer: how can people live better? Although there is no answer to this question, I am not as confused as before.
Why do you say that? Because when watching this film, I seem to have experienced the process of questioning life again.
A normal person, with judgment, knows what's important and what's not. A normal person, with many choices, is always biding his time. A normal person does not waste his energy in useless things. But Forrest Gump is not a normal person, his IQ is lower than ordinary people, he even almost entered the school for the mentally handicapped. His girlfriend, the school team, the army, table tennis, shrimp farming, running, it seems that everything he has is not his own choice, but someone else's choice. Of course, he doesn't ask ""what is life?"" He would just do one thing at a time.
What is the point of this story? I think the director, in a very extreme way, said a truth: choice is likely to mislead life. Because the choice is too much, some people do not work mindfully, this attitude further affected his life. ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know which one you're gonna get.""

This is a perfect movie that was a landmark film. This is a great movie. It is incredibly well made with a great story and script. Tom Hank's performance is just amazing. He does an amazing job. It is easily the best performance of the 90's. It is also the best performance as a mentally retarded person. It is just amazing. I love this movie. I think that the greatest part about this movie is the fact that it teaches you a lesson. It teaches you that you don't have to be a smart person to do incredible things. That is why I love this movie. It's amazing. I mean, he has leg braces, which he breaks off when he tries to run, he becomes a college football all-star, he becomes a Vietnam veteran who wins the congressional medal of honor.

His mother dies of cancer, Bubba gets killed in combat in Vietnam, Jenny has AIDs, and Leuitanit Dan loses his legs in Vietnam. That is amazing. I love this movie. This is one of my ten favorite of all time. I think that it is one of the ten best of the nineties, and is easily one of the best 30 over all ever made.

It gives the viewer so much more than a standard drama/romance film. It would call it a 'life' film; one that takes the emotions that everybody feels and serves them on a plate at a 5 star restaurant. Tom Hanks plays the title character in one of the most iconic acting performances of all time. Forrest is, in fact, my favorite film character of all time - and that's saying something. Unlike, some films with great acting roles, the film is not carried alone by Tom Hanks. A whole range of great actors (young and old) are in this breath-taking film. The music in this film is simply stunning; it is filled with child-like lullaby themes to symbolize the childish attitude that Forrest has to life. This is mixed with grand, epic pieces as we see Forrest mature infront of our eyes. The music is some of my favorite in all of cinema and brings a tear to my eye when I hear it. Robert Zemeckis is known for using hi-tech effects to give a unique feel to his films. Forrest Gump uses this technology in an amazing way; bringing Tom Hanks and us into historical events. The cinematography in this film is superb; the iconic feather scene at the start giving us a glimpse of what is to come.

Even though the movie is based on the book, it is remarkably different. In the book, Forrest goes into space; Bubba is white and meets Forrest in college; Forrest runs as a candidate in the senate; Forrest does not serve under Lieutenant Dan in the Army, but meets him in hospital afterwards; Forrest's mother and Jenny do not die (they do kick it in Gump & Co. though); and there is also Forrest's wrestling career and his friendship with the orangutang Sue that should be mentioned too. The book is a fantastic piece of literature and should be on every college syllabus everywhere. But if the film had been taken directly from the book, I doubt it would have been so successful. The film includes fantastic sequences (Forrest running and influencing pop culture; Forrest directly influencing John Lennon) that do not appear in the book. The way Forrest is tied into the last 40 years of American History is great, if a little convenient. I wonder though, whether the sequel will follow Gump & Co. or whether they will create another new monster.",

713,22 February 2013,neightb,9, The Importance of a Shoe,"I'm reading a lot of reviews. There's a lot that say that this is a great movie, and most I see say this because it is very sentimental, and there are a few that say this is an annoying and poor movie, because of what they see from it. Both may be right, I don't pretend to be the know all of answers. I just have my opinion. To those who love this movie because it is sentimental and powerfully overwhelming, it's true. First time I saw this movie a fear tears leaked out here and there, but I think there's a lot more under the surface here. More depth than just a sentimental movie. If you think about it, shoes make many appearances in this movie. In the very beginning Gump talks about his very first pair of shoes, ones that limited his mobility and left him vulnerable. As those broke away (albeit in a very cheesy way) he got new shoes, ones that allowed him to run away from danger and run to success, in the form of football. This allows him to graduate from University, which, one might say, is part of the American dream. But that is a whole other side to the movie. He joins the war, and while he's there he runs from danger, acting the hero by saving lives. When he leaves, he runs into a man who has no shoes, mainly because he has no legs. Lieutenant Dan, now a cripple, is bitter and angry because he cannot walk, and he is limited both in his ability to move and go places as well as limited in his ability to see beyond anything in life other than when he should have died. When Gump and Dan start the fishing company, Lieutenant Dan realizes the importance of life, (once again, cheesy) and he swims off. We don't see him for a while. Annndd Gump gets bored. So he runs, all across America (part of American dream, to travel?...) He returns home, Jenny comes back, random scenes occur blah blah blah and we come back to Gump's wedding. Lieutenant Dan comes back! He has legs, even! And with his legs he has a beautiful fiancée. I'll skip the rest. Yes there are random side stories of his life that are cheesy or don't contribute to the movie, but those are fun and lively, if a little unrealistic. Ping-pong? Hah! This is only one part of the numerous layers that make up this movie. A satire of the American dream, viewing American history through innocent and unbiased eyes, a description of life even! This movie is powerful in its complexity, and intricate in its depth. And yes, it is sentimental and fun to watch as well. To those who critique it for the ""ignorance is bliss"" view, perhaps look a little closer. This movie is not saying that one can succeed by doing nothing but being lucky, (though that is the end result, so I see how you can believe that) but is looking back through all the things I mentioned just before in a unique and entertaining way. Gump views the world as he walks through it, wearing whatever pair of shoes, doing whatever it is he's doing. He watches events as they occur, and he participates in them in his own way. He shows, through his simple-minded example, that you do not need to be brilliant or manipulative, or even fully functional in order to succeed.",

I argue back saying it only won 6 Oscars (compared to others that won more), that the academy just loves Tom Hanks and Robert Zemekis, and how they are better movies than Forrest Gump.

721,10 April 2008,blanbrn,8, One of the best films of all-time. That proves it's meant for everyone to be different and it's okay to live a simple life.,"""Forrest Gump"" certainly has to be one of the most heart touching and emotional films that brought joys to the masses over the years. People misjudge it though as a film about a dumb retarded boy named Forrest, yet I see it as a much different take as it proves it's okay to be different and slow and do things at your own pace and let things come to you and then good things will happen in life. Tom Hanks is great as Forrest Gump as the film spans a life period from Forrest's childhood to his growing up, starting with his humble start in a small Alabama town with his mother(wonderfully done by Sally Field). From the start Forrest was different as his mother taught him to see the world and life as a box of chocolates, not knowing what your ever gonna get. Yet by the hardships and for the way that Forrest was made fun of his determination and will would spark him on a life of unexpected but deserved greatness. From his college attending at the university of Alabama to his football playing to fighting in war, and making new friends to meeting the presidents! Also touching is his heartfelt relationship with life love Jenny(Robin Wright Penn). The direction and camera work and special effects of the way the film is crafted by Robert Zemeckis is brilliant and fabulous it makes the film move well from time period to time period. Most of all this film brings the message to me that destiny is often a piece of crap and life many times just goes and happens at random. Most of all it's okay to be different and it proves no matter how different that just by being simple many things can be accomplished, and that with faith and determination with god anything is possible. ""Forrest Gump"" is such a memorable winner because he did it his way.",
722,20 November 2017,Josh_The_Critic,9, Deserving as a Best Picture Winner?,"Is this movie worthy of being the best film of 1996? Well, I have not seen The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction yet, though I definitely plan to see them eventually. I, myself love history and the fact that Forrest Gump is scene throughout history can be pretty funny. I love that he is but into real footage of real events or is watching even just simply watching them happen. One of my favorite scenes is when he is making a speech after the Vietnam War happened. Forrest Gump is very innocent and doesn't know what the rally was for. That's what makes Tom Hanks' character so great; he's just super likable! The score is worth noting as really good too. When Jenny comes through that water calling Forrest's name is just a nice moment...then she has to leave again...and again. Not that that's an issue, because that in fact helps the film keep moving. My one problem here is surprisingly the symbolism...a lot of people may disagree with me here. I like the symbolism, but when Forrest narrates what the symbolism is it feels very blatant and doesn't let us think much. A lot of stuff would've been much better without words, and I think would've risen my score a lot. The cinematography is, of course, outstanding. The U.S. as some great shots like the speech shot and his running shots but the most interesting one to me was Vietnam. It had such diverse colors that made the war scenes better than they already are. Lastly, it had a great story and plot, making it a story that would make you wanting to come back for more.

727,3 July 2008,Robert_duder,10, MY 700TH REVIEW and what a great one!! I think Forrest Gump might be one of the best films of all time,"It had been a little while since I watched Forrest Gump and it wasn't but a few minutes before everything I loved about it came flooding back and by the time the credits rolled and I had dried my tears I realized that I think this is quite possibly the best film ever made. It may be my favourite movie of all time and for good reason because it is stone cold brilliant in every way and deserved everything from awards to box office glory that it received. Previously I have stated that JFK is my favourite film and in a complete league of it's own and now I state that Forrest Gump belongs in that category of elite films. The story is infamous and brilliant and touching and disturbing and covers every aspect of genre you can think of. The cast is absolutely brilliant. The direction is stunning and the special effects are unlike anything you will ever see. Director Robert Zemeckis is a brilliant director and has directed his way through many of my personal all time favourites including the Back To The Future Trilogy, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and What Lies Beneath. The thing about his story telling is that it's completely unique, there is something completely and utterly different about his films and Forrest Gump is truly the pinnacle of that talent. He seems to know his cast and surrounds himself with the best performances possible.",

747,2 June 2006,dee.reid,10, Simplicity at its best,"""Forrest Gump,"" 1994's controversial and acclaimed Best Picture Oscar winner and is itself adapted from the novel by Winston Groom, is the simple story of a simple man and the not-so-simple world he is born into. Tom Hanks is the title character, a Southerner with an IQ of 75, who as a boy is handicapped by a crooked back and forced to wear leg braces. Raised by his mother (Sally Field) to not let the world hold him back, she does the regrettable and sleeps with a school's principal to get him enrolled. His first days are hard-luck, but that changes when he lays eyes on the beautiful Jenny, and the two become close friends, even through high school, when she is now played by Robin Wright Penn. Once graduating high school, Forrest is encouraged to go to college, where he becomes a football star and is drafted into the United States Army upon graduation. Forrest's limited intelligence to the situation renders him blind to the Vietnam conflict, where his service is guaranteed. He's unaware of the growing resentment towards the war, but his heroic actions to save comrades including hardened veteran Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise) and best friend Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) during an ambush by the VC one day encourage a Medal of Honor award. Thus, the world as we know it is seen through the eyes of this simple man who leads an extraordinary journey through some of America's roughest periods: the 1960s through the late '70s. All of this is fickle to him, as his one true love Jenny continues to evade him (even though they see one another sporadically over the years, and their encounters are often very brief) and her life becomes increasing less than pleasant. ""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies for a reason: when all hell was breaking loose during radical times of change, one man saw it as a little more than nothing. His unwitting triumphs over the years - football star, war hero, Medal of Honor recipient, White House honorary guest, millionaire businessman, international Ping Pong champion, and ultimately, father - are extraordinary to everybody else except him, simply because he's too stupid to realize the significance of his actions. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, everything about ""Forrest Gump"" is classic and beautiful. From Hanks's brilliant and nuanced performance, to the Oscar-winning special effects (the insertion of Hanks into archival media footage; the digital erasure of Sinise's legs to make the audience believe he's a real amputee) to the closing credits, it shines and will forever remain shining as a modern American classic piece of cinema. Though Forrest himself may not know it, he's found one of the greatest fans in this writer. He's a true inspiration that nothing is impossible regardless of one's intelligence. His message is that nothing can hold you back except you. It's a dream come true from anyone's perspective.",
748,18 July 2006,PWNYCNY,10, Powerful performance by Gary Sinise,"This movie is special, and for one reason: Gary Sinise. Mr. Sinise's performance as Lt. Dan is one of the great performances in U. S. cinematic history. His poignant and powerful portrayal of a human being wallowing helplessly in the deepest recesses of despair is uncanny. Lt. Dan is the personification of suffering, of emotional desolation, of a man who is bent on self-destruction but deep down still wants to survive, still harboring a glimmer of hope that things may turn his way, that he may attain salvation and a measure of happiness in a life that has been ravaged by war. Because of Gary Sinise, Forrest Gump is a great movie.",
749,11 April 2003,ron_72180,3, Too overrated,"I was one of those people who had heard all the hype about Forrest Gump and then saw the movie. This movie is too overrated. Yes Tom Hanks pulls off a great performance as this character and it is pretty much a great history lesson, but I dont think it deserved all the awards and acclaim it received. In all I think only Tom Hanks deserved the award for best actor. We all know it's very hard to pull off a performance like that. Look at Sean Penn in I Am Sam....terrible. I wont go into what it's about cause we all know it. I know there are many out there who feel this was a great movie and I wont argue with you, you are all entitled to your opinion.

754,30 June 2012,Mr_McSuave,8, Tom Hanks in a different light,"I have never seen Tom Hanks in a role like this before, playing simple, oblivious Forrest Gump. This film is a real tear-jerker, causing me to cry several times as Forrest retells and lives through his toughest moments. Tom really makes you feel for his character, whether it be cringing, crying or smiling, you live every moment with Forrest. It is a story with many layers including love, war and achievement of Forrest's, unbeknownst to him, significant life. Forrest is a very easy to like character as he is brave, confident and dedicated, and you just want everything to turn out alright for him. This film is based on a book of the same name, but they have very different endings. I haven't read the book, but I doubt it could have similar success without the life that Tom Hanks breathes into the role of Forrest, Forrest Gump. I highly recommend this film to those who like feel good films and don't mind to cry a little, if you have a heart.",

The feather and the feather only is great in this movie; the rest is capable at best (Hanks' performance, some of the cinematography) and hackneyed at worst.  This is the sort of movie, like THE SOUND OF MUSIC, which cues its sentiment so strongly it's insulting.  It's interesting to take a movie like this and compare it with something like BIRDY (which has certain thematic similarities); BIRDY's premise is so much more far-fetched, and yet the movie has an authenticity GUMP can't manage.

The rewatchability is high. I have watched it several times now and still not getting bored. Each view presents different perspective of the movie.
Tom Hanks' acting is brilliant, it is not easy to act as a mentally-challenged person yet he did it fantastically.
A big part of the movie tries present the cultural history of the US, and this might be hard to pull off yet Robert Zemeckis is able to. 
But for me, there is an underlying dark undertone somewhere in the relationship between Forrest and the other characters, but Zemeckis' portrayal of Forrest's personality brilliantly covers it up.",
763,17 August 2018,avanjit-20257,9, Movie for a lifetime,"Well first of all shout-out to Tom Hanks for making the fiction look real and owning his character. Second if this movie was a project which I think it was then let me just say that it had the best arrangements that I have ever come across in my life. To second that thought I'd say this was the right movie for the director Zemeckis to prove that even a cash cow director could bewilder fans with his movie magic.
Now about the movie, a normal person would say that this movie has got sadness, comedy, seriousness and a load of other stuff which makes a perfect blend.
But I'm sorry as I have sincerely watched this movie and found out a couple more things than just genre-defying components. To start with this movie revolves around the central character and the central character holds dear to himself a few other characters so the movie also includes extra screen time for them, now the reason I have mentioned this fact is to make you realize that this is not about a person who has lived an extra-ordinary life and has changed the world with his feats, but quite the opposite. It is instead a movie about a simple honest man who has been around only a few people his whole lifetime and although of his non-credited contributions to the society he still remains intact with his loved ones. This creates a lot a way for the movie to be so mesmerizing but in the same time also be so sweet. End of story.",

Even through the tough times in high school to the frantic relationship with Jenny, Forrest still remained humble and resilient. Any anti-bullying campaign, in my opinion, should use Forrest Gump as a prime example. Maybe even go as far as showing the movie. The movie also shows what it truly means to keep a promise.

776,3 April 2020,karladavisio,10, Amazing,"The film ""Forrest Gump"" is not just a story about the life of an individual and his family on the background of real historical events. It is permeated with love and friendship. It is surprisingly bright, although the events are very different. And far from always joyful. Interestingly, the film has very few negative characters - forrest loves people. And this is natural - people turn to him and, accordingly, to the viewer with their best side.
The original seemed to me a way to drown out the sad moments in the film with Forrest comments. Most often they were rather stupid and not quite on the topic, which distracted from sadness and helped the viewer move on to other events.
The film was liked not only by me, but also by millions of other people, as the Six Oscars can say. The film teaches us to believe in ourselves, to believe in a dream, to believe in sincere genuine happiness. Teaches to love your mother. Teaches everything that is needed for a person who has lost hope of life. Teaches you how to live and never stop.
Forrest Gump definitely deserves its popularity and praise from critics. Probably the simplicity of its main character. He is easy to believe, his stories are breathtaking, and although some stories are really sad, the hero speaks of them as something pleasant, as some kind of new experience. The film teaches you not to lose heart, to love and respect, but it is worth a lot.",

My initial reaction was correct it is one of the worst films I have ever seen, only Bean was worst.  The film fails everywhere apart from the acting.  The script, locations some appalling dialogue and dreadful sentimentality, that must be lost on a non-US audience. Absolutely awful 1/10",
792,22 January 2021,judemcrobbie,10, One of the Greats,"Forest Gump is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
The best character study ever and it's not even close. Taxi Driver and Joker were my top before but this one displays emotion unlike no other movie.
The culmination of Hanks' acting and the storytelling portrayed by Zemekis immerses you so completely that despite very few of us understand a man like Gump, somehow he does.
Time is portrayed as an entity, moving around Gump, showing us how me may feel in such a peculiar nature that it feels so properly like how Gump acts.
How the director makes you feel about Gump is in such a way that you forget about the disability and focus on the man. Not only does this spread a powerful message, but despite the majority of not being nothing like forest, you fully understand the unbelievable actions, be it sitting on a bench for 2 hours or running for 3 years.
There is also not a single weak performance from anyone in the cast at all and Tom Hanks deserved that oscar well and truly.

Right from the start when we see a single white feather drifting around on the breeze until the end of the film you feel as though you are being carried along on an adventure that breathes life back into living. Tom Hanks is simply outstanding as Forest Gump and quite honestly I cannot imagine any other actor in the role of Forest Gump, Tom Hanks has made the role completely his own. Sometimes when I see Tom Hanks in other film roles I imagine him still playing Forest Gump. Forest Gump isn't extraordinary in any way, but the things he experiences are beyond the normal man. You do have to pinch yourself though at times. Is this really happening to Forest Gump or some figment of his fertile imagination. One man mocks Forest Gump for telling tall stories, while another woman present at the same time realizes that what he has been telling them is in fact true, but maybe with some embellishment thrown in for good measure.",

I have loved this movie since I first saw it. His longing to be loved by Jenni and the adventures the longing took him on are priceless. Just some regular guy having his foot in all these important moments in U.S. history. On a lonely day or when I need to put things in perspective and get a laugh, I pop this one in. I laugh, I cry, I think, I relax, I wonder and then I cry again at the end. I definitely like his mother and Jenni dying in the movie. It is very realistic that way. Watching Forrest sit on the stump waiting for little Forrest to come back and the feather taking off is a memorable moment for me. He lost important people in his life and gained something so priceless on the way. Jenni was gone but yet he still had a part of her, the best part. Life goes on and you take the bad with the good. I also learned life won't happen for you if you sit on the couch all day feeling sorry for yourself.",

When we begin the movie, we never want to pause it. As the story go, we can't escape. The original soundtrack is also a piece of legend. 142 minutes full of emotions.

809,31 March 2013,king_prawn_shaun,10," Bravo Hanks, bravo!!","A heart warming tale of love, deception and greed. Forest Gump is a local idiot with a big heart and a fine pair of Nike trainers. This film follows Forest as he stumbles into one catastrophe after another in his endless pursuit of 'Jenny' a somewhat cynical tramp who inadvertently catches the young Forest's eye. Jenny allows Forest a seat on the school bus, triggering a life long obsession in which Forest is rejected time and time again. Happily for Forest he eventually wins through and by sheer perseverance and strength of character our hero finally worms his way into Jenny's bed, accidentally spawning a child, who Jenny tragically also names Forest Also seen sporadically throughout the film is a foul mouthed alcoholic named 'lieutenant Dan' one of life's losers, lieutenant Dan loses both legs in a horrific accident and holds Forest solely responsible. Dan often berates Forest until a touching scene towards the end when Dan shows up out of no where sporting a brand new pair of prosthetic legs and a lovely Asian style wife, apparently forgiving Forest and simultaneously giving him his blessing for his union with Jenny. We also learn of Forest's sound financial brain as he makes millions through some very shrewd investments. Overall this film is a tad far fetched for my pallet, having said that I was very moved by Hanks performance, it brings to mind two questions 1. Where did he get his inspiration? 2. How far will Hanks stoop to win an Oscar?",
810,12 October 2015,spraytor-97991,10, Forrest Gump,"The movie Forrest Gump is about a boy who suffers from mental retardation. He also suffers with scoliosis and has to wear knee braces. The movie tells a story about his life and his accomplishments. He suffers bullying from the people in town and the kids in school. He grows up and proves a lot of people wrong. The story takes place in a small town called Greensboro, Alabama. Tom Hanks portrays the character Forrest Gump. This movie won eight Oscars, one of them being Best Actor in Leading Role. Tom Hanks won the award in 1995. He did a very good job of showing Forrest Gump without mocking his disability. We meet Forrest's character at bus stop talking to people on the bench about his life accomplishments. After that, the story starts with Forrest' first day on the bus. This is when Forrest first experiences the other kids bullying. Until he meets young Jenny, who lets him sit beside her on the bus. Young Jenny is played by Hanna Hall. Jenny becomes his best friend and doesn't look at his disability as a difference. Forrest and Jenny grow up together and spend all their time together. Jenny has an abusive and drunk father. Older Jenny is played by Robin Wright. Forrest gets many opportunities, he is asked to play football in college. You also see many history events and how innocent Forrest's eyes are to the world. The movie is told in the 1970s, a lot of movements happened in the seventies. The movie shows both Forrest's experiences and Jenny's life, vastly different. Jenny went through the hippie movement, with drugs and peace. Overall the film Forrest Gump is a great movie. It's definitely a movie you could re watch and still enjoy it as much as the first time.",
811,27 February 2005,lizzie-50,9, One of a kind,"The first time I saw this film it was in Portugeuse with subtitles and I watched it and thought what the hell am I watching this for? I absolutely hated it, I couldn't understand it for one thing, but on some level I must have connected with it because ever since I've wanted to sit down and watch it again. Today after 5 or 6 years I finally got to watch this film again, this is one of my favourite films ever. This film really is one of a kind, I have never seen a film like it. Most of the story is narrated by Tom Hanks's Forrest with him telling passers by his life story, he is looking back on his life and it is evident that he has played an important role in history unaware though he is. Forrest's story is a heartwarming, heartbreaking tale, despite his fame and fortune the one person he's ever wanted will never truly be his for any length of time and what can you do but cry? Without doubt this is Tom Hanks's film, I doubt that any other actor could carry off the role of Forrest, the other characters are acted superbly but Tom Hanks's fully deserves praise for this film. In my eyes Forrest Gump is a real person who has led a very real life, his heartfelt monologues will stay with me forever & I will always remember what ""Mama always said..."" I am yet to find another film that has stayed with me the way this film have, I have never waited years to see a film and will probably never do again. This film stands out, it is one of a kind, there is no other film like this film and there is nobody else like Forrest Gump.

Every once in a while, I'll also see a film the the entire American public has enjoyed and disliked through the years gone by. Among those is FORREST GUMP, which proved Tom Hanks as an acclaimed dramatic actor. The tale of a young man living through the life and times is among the many landmarks existing in cinema today. No one understood that the nostalgic visuals and props (plus the legless Gary Sinise) were actually real and not copied or duplicated, meaning an Oscar winner. It is both funny, serious, and heartbreaking for one entire movie, but it isn't labeled as a ""comedy"" like many have called it. The film greatly shows Hanks maturity after his comical heydays, and it continues on. It also shows the way past generations of time are reborn in this present, but disillusioned era. FORREST GUMP is a bona fide genuine classic that will stick around in future generations to come. I ADMIT IT!",

816,26 April 2019,jacobhunt6,10," Beautiful, and executed to a tee","Forrest Gump is the defining motion picture of the latter half of the 20th century, in so many ways. It is a heart-warming, heartbreaking and beautifully constructed film that takes its audience on an emotional journey that will change hearts, minds and perspectives. The performance of Tom Hanks is utterly astounding. Hanks truly is what made this film a class above, and this is a sterling performance that stands out even in such an accomplished career. He brings heart, sincerity and empathy to a role that immediately captures the love and respect of the audience and leaves them in tears at the beauty and tragedy of Forrest's experiences.
The story itself is a genius concept executed to perfection. It is an exploration of the last fifty years of the 20th century through the eyes of a literal everyman. The innocent, unassuming perspective of Forrest Gump allows the audience to reflect on some of the highest and lowest points in America's history through a fresh set of eyes, seeing history from the point of view of someone without the prejudices and biases that come with educated thought and opinion. Forrest's mental handicap was necessary to create such a powerful everyman character, and yet Hanks manages to execute this without resorting to comical stupidity and dampening the credibility of the film's sincerity.
To emphasise the perfection of this film's writing even further, it is an exemplification of circular narrative, with incredible use of music and a variety of film types, camera angles and colour palettes to cover the roughly fifty-year period within its narrative reaches. Robert Zemeckis and his production team simply do everything right. This is a beautiful tale of love and hate, war and peace, comedy and tragedy that will be talked about for decades, and rightfully so. It is a testament to the writing of Winston Groom, and of course the directing of Zemeckis.
Hanks' performance is backed up by a supporting cast that executes their respective jobs perfectly, with special mention for Mykelti Williamson and Gary Sinise. Bubba and Lieutenant Dan are iconic characters that reflect tumultuous periods of American history, and their interactions with Forrest are beautifully executed to a tee.
Forrest Gump is unique in so many aspects. It is a wonderful exploration of the world through a fresh set of eyes, which is a concept so frequently attempted and so rarely achieved to such an impact as this. The world often needs to reflect on itself without its own prejudices, and there is no better film than Forrest Gump to show us all the state of affairs that we live in. This film should rightfully go down in history as one of the greats, and Hanks' performance should be hailed as perhaps the greatest leading performance in cinema. He captured our hearts from the moment that feather settled on his shoe and kept them neatly tucked in his suitcase until that feather drifted away yet again. Beautiful filmmaking at its finest.",

It's as manipulative as a film can ever be, pulling strings and begging the audience to cry, and the entire event is drowned in sticky-sweet syrup. And yet - incredibly - Forrest Gump truly works. It is not without flaw - in fact, it would be nearly impossible to count down all of its many problems - but this film succeeds in being an entertaining, whimsical, and - at times - quite beautiful portrayal of life, love, and 20th century America. And while one would be quick to point to director Robert Zemeckis in regards to the film's success, or perhaps Eric Roth's screenplay, or even Winston Groom's book upon which the film is based, I think the reason this film works, is because of Tom Hank's legendary performance as the title character.",

It teaches viewers many life lessons and shows the aspects of life through a different lens. Many walk away from this film wanting to embrace the little things in life. There is not much to dislike about Forest Gump as a character. He has such a big heart and because he is slow-witted, he has a very simplistic yet fulfilling lifestyle. Gump always follows his heart and does what he believes to be right, regardless of others judgment. An example of this is all the times he ""saved"" his best friend Jenny. There were a few times in the film that Forest didn't appreciate how a man was speaking to or touching Jenny, and every time Forest would immediately pry them off of her, despite her requests. This film also had comedy, drama, action, and emotion, perfectly blended together to create a great all-American film.",

How can a man with an IQ of 75 become a millionaire while us regulars are pulling in a regular salary of $45,000? The answer: Perseverance, Character. Ambition, Pride, and finally, Inspiration. That's what gets it done, and this movie gets it done with great fashion. It preservers through the rough times Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) possesses (the death of Bubba, his mom, and Jenny). The character he had for going back to get the wounded men on the front when Gump was in the Vietnam War, and allowing people to run with him in his mindless running. Ambition to try and succeed with what he wanted to do with his life (be something, and get there), as well as braving out a storm during a day out on the sea looking to catch some shrimp. Pride, his confidence in himself, the way he handles things around himself, and the ability to handle his own situations.

Every detail, every action means something in this films, there is no scenes just for eyes watching with brain relaxing. And sooth to say I'm very tired with hearing reviews about ""the film about a down"". A retard (in accordance with the medical sense)? I agree. But human after all, much more humane than anybody else because of the absence of evil within. This is the toughest issue - only a retard (or mentally challenged) person can be truly humane in the modern world? ""Forrest Gump"" is not a manual for ones who want to become a millionaire or a great player or get lucky. This film is about life with many things it contains - from life values to a country history. Furthermore, they all are shown in a different light. So, Forrest Gump is a simple guy without mastermind at all, but squeaky clean and morally healthy man at the same time. He believes in things another people forgot, he has pure heart, being naive, but honest, frank, unmercenary and true friend. He is guileless, though he seems to be an idiot in the eyes of others. Despite of it Gump does make a difference between good and bad things, truly good and bad ones. And I discern this movie as a parable about human being, human life. ""Stupid"" Gump couldn't understand what was the life: ""...if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze...maybe it's both."" But who can say the absolute truth about what is life being? The eternal mystery.",

Despite his sub-normal IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for many of the most memorable events of the second half of the 20th century. Entirely without trying, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon. Featured alongside Tom Hanks are Sally Field as Forrest's mother; Gary Sinise as his commanding officer in Vietnam; Mykelti Williamson as his ill-fated Army buddy who is familiar with every recipe that involves shrimp; and the special effects artists whose digital magic place Forrest amidst a remarkable array of historical events and people. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi",

I had never set out to purposely avoid Robert Zemeckis 1994 epic, I simply wasn't interested in it. After my evaluation of 1994 (once my affair with film started), I became upset that Forrest Gump could possibly win Best Picture over Pulp Fiction. As mentioned before, I am a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino and I greatly appreciate what he does cinematically. Pulp Fiction is a classic with so many wonderful devices used; a true tour-de-force of Tarantino's incredible directing chops. I was then dumbfounded to learn that Quentin's masterpiece didn't lose to Robert Redford's Quiz Show, another movie I thought was in a class of its own. I might add that many people would insert Shawshank Redemption in this list of notable snubs I've provided, however, that film did for me all Forrest Gump did and left me unimpressed.

905,8 January 2023,dalyons-09311,9, One of the Most Important Movies to See,"Most of the time, I watch movies because they're enjoyable, and don't get me wrong, Forrest Gump is very enjoyable. But in this case, I also think that it's important for people to see this movie. The messaging is bit less clear in the movie than it apparently is in the book, but the idea is that there are some things you can't control (life is like a box of chocolates). You should accept and be happy with what you have, be kind to people, and be the best person you can be. Forrest follows this philosophy, and everything works out for him. A lot of people interpret it differently, saying that the politics are that Forrest does exactly what he's told and is successful while Jenny challenges power and is not, but I think that's over-analyzing. No way Robert Zemeckis was pushing an authoritarianism message here. Forrest does not always do what he's told. His ping pong career, for example, was about how he found something unique he was good at despite his limitations. In fact, the whole point of the Lieutenant Dan plotline is that he did NOT do what he was told. Forrest always does what's right, and that's what makes him successful. Rather than spending his life complaining about and asking for sympathy for his limitations, he ignores them and beats everybody else by just being good. I also don't see the character of Jenny as making some sort of point or argument. Instead, I see Jenny simply in her relation to Forrest, that she was someone he saved. Her childhood trauma set her on a dark path, and Forrest pulled her off of it. Despite having absolutely nothing going for him, by just being good, Forrest not only makes a great life for himself, but saves everyone around him. That's the message of this movie, and that's why I think it's so important that everyone sees it. That's the moral compass people need nowadays. Beyond the politics, the acting is phenomenal. Tom Hanks deserved ten Oscars for his acting in this movie, and his acting in the last few scenes was legendary. The soundtrack is amazing. The humor is really enjoyable. Everything works. It's just a really wholesome movie. The reason it loses a star, though, is the running. It feels so out of place. It sort of makes sense for the character, but it just feels so pointless. He's just aimlessly running between the two Jenny sequences. It didn't feel like a climactic conclusion. It felt off, and I'm sure I'd feel differently if I read the book. Honestly I wish Jenny didn't leave and that you go right from their scenes in the house to the ending scenes. The running didn't really add anything and just killed the momentum.",

Not necessarily to be taken literally; this film was so lauded (possibly unknowingly) for its seamless ability to compartmentalize and package the most recent years of American history up to 1994.

A good knowledge of American History helps to identify profound ideas that further strengthen the audiences idea of the movie. The story plot is developed through a series of life lessons that changes the character into being a more responsible and mature adult. The Story revolves around Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks) who is often bullied for his leg brace and his egregiousness in society. This compassionate young boy falls in love with Jenny(Robin Wright) from a very young age. One of the key points in the movie is when Forrest joins the military where the director(Robert Zemeckis)accurately portrays the mixed feelings everyone had about the Vietnam war and the consequent events that pursued after it such as the Watergate Scandal. The movie teaches a lot about the essence of American History and the events that have shaped modern society today. The story depicts an accurate representation of the rural setting and the challenges that each character had to face due to their background, identity and ethnicity. Overall, the movie is a must watch for every American and those who wish to learn the importance of American history and its implication on their lives today.",

920,11 June 2021,thejcowboy22,6, You know they let me cut the grass for free.,"My Grandmother took joy in gardening. I mean she really took joy in gardening/puttering. There she stood in my backyard with a rake in hand 5' tall and 85 lbs in a sundress and apron ready to work. As a youngster, I asked my Granny why she would work all day in the hot sun when she was in the leisure years of life? Forrest Gump is one of those films that is a fairy tale of a mentally challenged man who we follow from childhood to adulthood. What makes this movie appealing is the events in his life, whether it be historical or circumstantial. The scene starts with Forrest Gump sitting at a bus stop in Savannah, Georgia waiting for the #9 bus to arrive. Gump is accompanied by strangers on the bus stop bench. He begins his life's story and his early years growing up in a huge boarding house. His mother, played by Sally Field Is a single woman who runs the estate. She is a take-charge type who emphasizes to young Forest that he can do anything if he puts his mind to it. She takes no gruff from the locals which reminds me a little of the Norma Rae character that Sally perfected in winning an Oscar a few years earlier. Gump had health problems being born with a curved spine and limited intelligence. Despite his afflictions, Gump attends regular school as he meets his first friend Jenny on the school bus. I must say I was taken by the performances of the child actors. Michael Conner Humphreys and Hanna Hall look so adorable sitting together on the bus (like Peas and Carrots.) We follow Gump's life meeting famous people from the boarding house and then fast-forwarding into his teen years with a penchant of running at record speed or as Gump puts it, ""Runs like the wind blows."" We follow Forrest, who ends up in College as an All-American Kick returner. While in college Gump has front-row seat to the end of segregated schooling and a trip to the White House. Next Forrest enlists in the Army and ends up in Vietnam. There he meets on the bus Bubba Blue who seems a little off, but constantly promotes his idea for his post-service plans of being a shrimping boat captain. The scenes from the jungle are captivating and rival some of the greatest war movies on the screen to date plus the musical soundtrack with songs from Jimmie Hendricks and Buffalo Springfield. There Gump meets his commander, Lieutenant Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise) who he becomes entangled in a heroic way. Gump gets wounded and while recovering, he takes up Ping pong and becomes an expert player. Gump represents the U. S. in the sport and visits mainland China. With his tournament money he earned plus a sneaker endorsement, Gump takes the money and buys a run-down Shrimping boat. While all this is going on, Gump would always keep up with Jenny (Robin Wright). The love of his life, Jenny strayed off to the hippie culture scene as the camera follows her experience experimenting in magazine modeling, showbusiness, anti-war protesting, and drugs. Gump and Jenny's paths cross a couple of times but only for a moment. More historical moments and famous people are edited throughout the movie. Multiple landscapes and urban dwellings fill the story as Gump's journey continues as Hanks's narration using a southern drawl underlines each scene. A potpourri of historical events well-edited putting Gump in the center. The visual and special effects are barely noticeable. When viewing I personally want to just run out of my home in the open country, but that only happens in the movies. As for my title, with all of Gump's accomplishments, the only time you see him truly at ease, besides keeping Jenny company, was when he rode his lawnmower over his personal acreage. Gary Sinise does quite a job physically and Sally Field a Mother Gump mentoring her deficient child should be a benchmark for parenting. Also, the undertones and subliminal messages of historical events past fill the story. Just another improbable journey that seems probable under the direction of Robert Zemeckis. As for my dear Grandmother, she always got the yard in order. Just one thing less to worry about!",

It's brilliant to be in a movie that was a huge success both commercially with more than 600M$(second most in 1994 behind only THE LION KING)and critically with six Oscars (including Best Picture).

They were all stolen by ""Forrest Gump"".  These two other movies which were completely different in their style from the movies of the same genre as them but who came before them were completely over-looked.

961,17 March 2007,danjakubik,9," An unconventional film, but one with genuine charm and sweetness","I have seen ""Forrest Gump"" (FG), a number of times, since I first saw it theatrically July 1994, when it was first released. I was first captured by it's beautiful music score. Then the story and Tom Hanks's performance as Forrest Gump, also won me over. This film knows how to push the right emotional buttons. There is no conventional story or plot in this film, yet the film works very well. Some people dislike this film, because the main character is of low intelligence and his adventures in life seem hard to believe. There are several reasons to attribute the big success of this film. Partly the screenplay, partly Tom Hank's performance, partly the music score and the film's sweep through 30 years of recent and familiar American history. FG is a very American film. Americans like a story of a simple person achieving great things. I believe many people reacted and related to the character of Forrest Gump in this film. A simple, innocent and humble man achieving great things in his life. Part of the moral of the story, is that brains aren't always necessary to achieve in life, a warm and kind heart can achieve in other ways in life. The story idea is that life is both destiny and luck. I like that philosophy and agree with it. To me, FG is a modern classic, American film.",

I love the fact that he was in the army and even though he was not welcomed he made a long and lasting friends. Another thing is that he was always keeping his faith in God strong and true. He is an honest man and his momma raised that way. She did what was best for him.even though at times is didn't seam like it. And last thing Is that no matter what life throws at you.

""Forrest Gump"" is a fable of this century, a very beautiful and moving fable. The actors are great: Tom Hanks gives a very tender performance, made by innocence and surprise, Robin Wright is the lost angel full of sadness, Gary Sinise shows us all the rage and self-destruction of his character and Sally Field is the Mum we all wish to have.

While the creators of such movies meticulously contrive each scene to be a tear-jerking, heart-rending epiphany into the human spirit, the makers of Forrest Gump set out to tell what is simply a great story of one man's life, where all emotion is merely an honest by-product and nothing more.

1009,22 April 2017,davispittman,7, Not as great as everyone says but still pretty good,"Forrest Gump is a movie just about everyone knows about and have at least heard of if they haven't seen it. I will start out by saying that Tom Hanks really did do a great job at playing the lead role of Forrest Gump, he definitely deserved that Academy Award win, he is skilled and very committed. I also thought that Robin Wright was good in her role as Jenny, the childhood friend turned love of his life. They actually didn't have a whole lot of interaction together, the times they were on screen together were good and flowed pretty well, but throughout most of the movie it's Forrest going through his life and experiencing a lot of different things without Jenny. As he grows on his journey he always thinks about Jenny and we see her and what she's doing in life, but most of their time together is towards the end, with the exception of some brief time spent together in the middle of the movie. Sally field is also here and she was a great choice for Forrest's mother. Field works very well with Hanks and she has the perfect essence about her to play the southern mother with the advice that everyone quotes ""life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get"". The acting is of course great and the script is pretty good too. The reason I'm giving this film a 7 and not a 9 or even a 10 is because in my opinion there were parts of the film where I felt like it dragged a little, where I was slightly bored, overall I don't consider one of the greatest movies of all time like most do, but I do think it's a good movie.

It's a love story, a social commentary of America(as hard as it tries not to be) and is hilarious. All wrapped into one.

1018,29 October 2020,Abdulxoxo,8, Entertaining but flawed,"Heartwarming and sentimental. Tom Hanks' narration is fun and strictly from his mentally challenged character Forrest Gump's child-like perspective. This keeps Forrest Gump innocent as a film, but thoughtful for the audience who know the historical events are real and have meaning. My problem with the movie is its ridiculously long run-time. It could easily have cut a whole half hour and nothing of importance would have lost. It takes a bit of time before anything interesting happens and focuses too much on silly moments in Gump's life. This movie does little to make you understand Gump's perspective until he says he may be stupid, but he understands love to Jenny. I like Tom Hanks' energetic and likable performance but it's the Vietnam veteran Lieutenant Dan played by Gary Sinise that stole the show. He captures the humor and depression of his situation that makes the movie feel so real, even though it's all a fantasy. The Jenny character is somewhat unlikable, as she uses Gump when she needs him, but does not offer any kindness in return. She is important to Gump as she is his friend, but you wonder why she never feels as real as Hanks' right hand man. Sally Field is at least supportive and kindly as his odd mother. Both Forrest and Jenny feel more like representations of their era instead of complete characters. I think that Forrest's whole life is all random chance encounters and dumb luck, so was there really a message at all? if yes then it's just ridiculous.",

It remains possibly the most controversial winner of 'The Best Picture ' award in the history of the ceremony. In 1995 it won over both 'Pulp Fiction' and 'The Shawshank Redemption', which I feel to were both overrated, so for me I guess it deserved it. 'Forrest Gump' is a very moving tale and deals with many human emotions, highlighted through the eyes of a man, we deem only as being simple. The story is beautifully shot and the scenes during the Vietnam War particularly well handled. Many have enjoyed and even loved this movie, so I don't want to bring it down in any way.",

1021,22 September 2019,Easygoer10,8," Copy of ""Being There""","Although this is set in a different era, it draws heavily upon Peter Sellers' masterpiece performance in ""Being There"" (1979). So much is identical to what Sellers' character, ""Chauncey Gardner"" becomes in ""Being There"". Tragically, Sellers died the following year at age 54. Regardless, Forrest Gump is well deserving of the excellent reception it receiv ed; both critically and at the box office. However, to this day, I cannot compare to the superiority of Sellers comedic skills. Most people agree he was the greatest comedic actor of the 20th Century, and that includes me. Having been cast in 2 Stanley Kubrick films: ""Lolita"" (1962) and ""Dr. Strangelove"" (1964) shows how much respect he got from the master of all directors (Kubrick). While making Dr. Strangelove, he plays 4 different roles, including the eponymous Dr. Strangelove. Kubrick was ""rolling on the floor with laughter; egging Peter Sellers on to even higher heights"", as Christiane Kubrick said on the DVD or Bluray discs.

1041,23 June 2000,nashcalefarms,4, I did not like this movie,"This movie was mediocre and i gave it a 4, but since i was so outraged that it beat out pulp fiction and shawshank redemption i choose to dislike it even more. i don't mind feel-good movies most of the time, as long as the fact that it is a feel-good movie isn't being thrown in my face while i'm watching it. forrest gump is one of those movies that tells you all the time how and what you should be feeling. and maybe all movies do this (i think film as an artform is definitely more manipulative lets say then painting or sculpture), and maybe the better movies are just the ones which do a better job of concealing it. regardless, forrest gump was boring, contrived, and simplistic. on another note, why is it every time someone portrays a mentally disabled person it automatically praised as good acting? i mean, hanks is a pretty good actor, but the trend is getting annoying. dustin hoffman did a fantastic job in rain man, but since then that kind of role has been way too much critical acclaim. maybe its because its such an extreme kind of portrayal that viewers don't know whether its realistic or not so they assume its great acting. i tend to find underacting to be more indicative of talent ( a la robert deniro as opposed to ""hoohah!"" pacino). anyways, movies like gump set good filmmaking back by twenty years.",

1043,19 December 2016,PartialMovieViewer,10, A Great Movie with Longer Lasting Great Results...Thank You Mr. Sinise,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Before I begin, I am never a fan of Hollyweird's portrayal of the south, but they do like their broad-brush perceptions of everyone – and I have come to expect it. The movie itself I thoroughly enjoyed, but there is another reason I have to elevate this movie to such a high pedestal. It wasn't the pace, even though the flow of the story was outstanding. There was never a dull moment. And the story itself was definitely a very good 'feel-good' nature...but that is not the reason for the highest of accolades. I walked into the theater skeptical and exited, hoping there would be more. The acting was spot-on. Again...this is not the reason for my highest of marks. From the smallest part to the star, they were all enjoyable. I am not always a Sally Field fan, but as Mother-Gump, I really liked her. She knew quite well what she had to work with and she did her best to give her flawed her son a road map through life. Forrest Gump, being the loving son, never veered from the plan. Stumbling along that path, Gump couldn't help but fall into countless, seemingly inescapable misfortunes. Whether it was timing, serendipity or just plain luck, the Tom Hanks character's always rebounds with better than fortunate results. There are so many interesting twists and turns this flick takes, I cannot put my finger on one outstanding incident. Once again, this is not the reason for my love of the movie. But now comes the reason I enjoyed (or should that be appreciate) this movie so very much. Of all the interesting characters Mr. Hanks bumps into along his character's life-journey (real or fictional), the one I am most thankful for is LT. Dan. As outstanding Gary Sinise was in this roll, what Mr. Sinise did with his fame, is truly amazing. Look at what this actor has done since the movie. He is one person who has dedicated so much of his time to helping veterans and their families. He is an American Hero. He has selflessly helped so many of those who were wounded on real battlefields. Unlike many stars who will read a line or two for veteran-related commercials (which I am thankful for), this man is dedicated. He walks the walk and talks the talk. So for this reason I say this this movie is at the top of the heap. Convoluted reasoning, maybe, but it is my reasoning. I am just being truthful. An outstanding moviewith even better results.",

I do not believe any other actor in the world could have played the part as well as he did. He really is one of the best actors around these days. People keep on saying that this movie mugged Shawshank Redmption at the Oscars, which is very unfair because although that is also one of my favourite films, this just about overtook it for me. The script by Eric Roth and Hanks's acting here for me do by a small amount outdo Shawshank although many will disagree. In fact I don't know how earth Alan Silvestri's score didn't get an Oscar. It is probably one of the best i've ever heard and The Lion King definitely didn't deserve it i'm afraid. The same applies to Sinise's performance which also deserved an Oscar.

But for me, what makes this film stand out more than any other with a genuinely moving intelligent screenplay is not the unforgettable moments with quotes such as  'life is like a box of chocolates, you never know which one you're going to get' which eloquently explains the questions of the universe nor is it the endearing character study supported by some of the finest actors in the industry (Sally Field, Robin Right Penn, Gary Sinise and Mykelti Williamson are all exceptional) but it is one man- Tom Hanks. Although 'everybody casts Tom Hanks'and the question why? is always asked, well this answers all questions.

Without giving away any crucial elements in the picture I will simply write...pay close attention to his shoes in the picture and everything they ever say about feet.  Pay even closer attention to Forrest's first conversation with Lt. Dan.  It foreshadows their entire relationship.

I didn't like the philosophical contemplations made by Gump as he becomes ""wise"" nor the way the movie concludes with the unnecessary death of Jenny which leaves Forrest raise his child that in turn doesn't seem to have any particular problems with that.

This movie will cause you to open your heart and your mind, following Gump on his journey of determination to prove he could be a real man for Jenny.

1071,4 June 2007,alexos3,10, Forrest Gump Film Rieview,"My suggestions to the film, Forrest Gump review are about the irony of this story, the setting, the characterization, the plot, and the theme. I thought this movie tells us about everyone's life and my opinion of this movie was that I liked it very much and it is very enjoyable to watch. You won't get bored and the plot of the movie always develops. In the movie Forrest Gump, the setting is rather weird because it is set in a small fictional town in Alabama. That is where Forrest starts. Later in the movie the story takes place in the whole world. This means that he represents every human being. The time setting is between the 1950s and 1980s. This time was important to the U.S. history because it was after the World War II and it was a new start for the people of the United Sates of America. Another example of everybody or universal is the character Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump. I think he is a very good actor and the role suits him. When Forrest Gump was a little child he had polio and a low level of IQ. His IQ was around 70. He lived with his mom in a big farm outside the town. They had no money so Forrest's mother used their big house as a hotel. On the first day of school, he met Jenny. Forrest thought she was a nice-looking young girl and fell in love. Another important point of him is that he had polio and everyone rejected him except for Jenny. He had polio as he was born and it is when the legs aren't strong enough to hold you and he had to wear braces. Sally Fields plays Mrs. Gump, she is Forrest's mother and cares a great deal about Forrest. After Forrest grows old she got a sickness and died with an old age after Forrest becomes popular. She was a very good mother to Forrest. Robin Wright as Jenny lives alone with her father in a very small house also outside of the town and her father abuses her very often so she tries to stay away from the house as long as possible. In the movie, Gary Sinise plays Lt. Dane. He was a super realistic character, meaning that he was almost too realistic for this movie. He plays his role really well and my opinion to him is that he is the best actor from this movie. Bubba, he is a fascinating unrealistic character. Myketti Williamson plays Bubba in the movie and was the best friend of Forrest in the movie. He is the meaning of true friendship. The one thing that is unrealistic is that Forrest Gump cannot meet all the presidents of America and all the celebrities that he saw in the movie and run around the world without any reason. It is rather a symbolic meaning. The plot of this movie is very interesting. As time passes the plot development raised always higher and higher. One of the themes of this movie is that the main character, Forrest Gump, represents everybody's life. One of the quotes that he said was ""life is like a box of chocolates."" It simply means that you will never know what will happen in life because you never know what piece of chocolate you will take out. Sometimes you take a good one out or sometimes you take one out you don't like that much. The other interesting quote was ""stupid is as stupid does."" This quote's significance means that you should not judge someone on their reputation but on their actions or it is stupid to call people stupid. This movie was a really good movie. I would rate it really high because the plot of this movie is really interesting and the director must have really thought about it. It would be a really hard movie to make. I think Forrest Gump is a movie that everyone has to watch because you will see how everyone's life is like. The plot is really interesting because it has a big increase all the time. I like that the plot development of this movie was like this. I really recommend this film to everyone.",

1074,14 May 2020,saadanathan,8, The best of Robert Zemeckis 8/10,"I grew up watching this movie a thousand times and enjoyed it everytime. The story of life and death, challenges and fears, and if life decides your fate of you decide on your own. Everything in this story is emotional and well made. The plot is told from the point of view of Forrest Gump. A man with low IQ who is really special in his perspective on life. Tom Hanks has done a remarkable job on the role and is considered one of his best. The directing by Robert Zemeckis is perfect, the amount of writing and effort put into this film is well appreciated. Even if ""Back to the future"" is well known by Zemeckis I think this film is better, simply because of the story. The movie is fulled with touching and great moments, like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.",
1075,16 March 2012,acv-number-one,10, Many things to learn from this movie,"The movie is beautiful. There are many messages in it. The main idea I've got is - turn yourself on and keep on going whatever you're doing. Once you've decided what you want to do, just do it! Don't stop to ask yourself questions such as: ""is it worth it?"" in moments of despair. Another message - be simple. A simple man achieved a lot knowing only just a few basic things his mother taught him. This movie is about action. There are many things to say, but it is better to watch it. Maybe I'll read the book one day. It is a story of a gifted man, who got in favorable circumstances and kept on developing his skills. This is a powerful movie and should definitely be in the top 10 of all times.",

Tom Hanks was a near-perfect cast decision and he executed the role brilliantly as an innocent, less- able boy (who turns into a man throughout the film) and one can almost feel some physical chemistry between Hanks and the writer(s).

And the soundtrack is a very good mix of oldies. One thing that strikes me as impressive in this movie is the attention to details. Such as the filming of Bubba's ansectors and Lt. Dan's history of ansestors dying in wars. Even the most standard of short scenes can take hours to film. These quick flashbacks take up less than 12 seconds of film and weren't even totally necessary to film, but they did anyway. That gives this movie an A for effort in my book.",

1102,15 March 2020,baileycrawly,2, Did I Watch the Same Movie?,"Forrest Gump didn't do it for me.
I'd like to say it's because it wasn't what I expected, but I didn't go in with any particular expectations, other than the endlessly over-quoted ""Life was like a box of chocolates"" and ""Run, Forrest, run!"" I didn't go in with any elements of the plot in my mind; I was completely blind and open-minded.
The film I watched failed to hold my attention. Part of the reason why the top films of all time are so endearing are because the creative team behind them have successfully manipulated the viewer to care deeply about the characters, enough to invest a little bit of themselves into those characters.
Forrest Gump didn't really have that. The movie, for the most part, is about a guy sitting on a park bench telling the story of his life. Which is fine in theory, but until the last 20 minutes or so, it doesn't feel like it's building to anything. It's just a guy telling his story and, although the ending of the film wraps it all up nicely, there's an awfully sizeable chunk of film to set through that doesn't give much of an impression of a purpose, which made it a major headache and tedious watch for me.

1105,8 July 2020,dr_clarke_2,4, Pretty but very superficial.,"Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump is much-loved, as is its star Tom Hanks. But it's an odd beast, and often crops up on lists of films that won the Academy Award for Best Picture, but really shouldn't have. A little scrutiny reveals some of the reasons why: more than a quarter of a century after it was released, it resembles nothing so much as a curate's egg.
Loosely based on a novel by Winston Groom, Forrest Gump is a whistle-stop tour of the second half of twentieth-century America, focalised through the eponymous character. Gump meets John F. Kennedy, witnesses George Wallace's ""stand in the schoolroom door"", observes sixties counter-culture, serves in Vietnam, becomes tangentially involved in the Watergate scandal, meets John Lennon, and much, much more. At times it's quite funny, for example when Gump's mother has sex with the school principle to safeguard Gump's education, and when Jenny lets Forrest touch breasts, causing him to ejaculate. At other times, it's quite moving, such as when Gump tearfully says goodbye to Jenny at her grave. Mostly however, it's actually rather dull.
Forrest Gump is often interpreted as a conservative movie, one argument being that Gump's clean-living and successful lifestyle is positively contrasted with that of his friend and (briefly) lover Jenny, who adopts a hippy counter-culture lifestyle, takes drugs and eventually dies of an STD. The only people likely to interpret the film in this way are those too stupid to make the link between the sexual abuse she suffers as a child and the psychological damage it causes her as an adult, which only Forrest Gump's unconditional love for her provides her with any respite from. More relevant to the conservative argument is the fact that Gump - who serves his country in Vietnam without question - is rewarded (dramatically if not literally) by stumbling into fame and fortune without doing a great deal to actually earn it, arguably peddling the blatantly false message that serving America with unswerving loyalty brings its own rewards. Dan Taylor's fate might initially seem to contradict or at least counterbalance this argument, but then he too gets a pat and twee happy ending.
Tom Hanks has described the film as non-political and non-judgmental and there's perhaps some truth in that. The film shows various events through Gump's eyes, but he doesn't pass comment on any of them (which is patronisingly implied to be because with an IQ of seventy-five he doesn't have enough insight or understanding to do so). Notably, when Gump decides to start running non-stop for four years, people ask him what cause he's running for, listing several examples; he says he just felt like running. Ultimately, for all the interpretations that Forrest Gump has been subjected to, it might simply what it appears to be at face value: a vapid film about an utterly boring character that just happens to have impressive production values.
And it is vapid. The character of Gump is of course completely unbelievable, blundering through life and meeting famous people, surviving adversity almost by accident, and achieving unlikely successes as a ping pong player and a shrimp-boat captain. His teaching Elvis to dance, inspiring John Lennon to write ""Imagine"", inspiring a man to make a fortune with ""bad things happens"" car bumper stickers and other such contrivances are embarrassingly trite. Tom Hanks gives an impressively convincing performance as Gump and occupies the role so naturalistically that he becomes Gump; it's quite remarkable, a performance that sees him bring a specific accent, body language and facial expressions to the part and maintain them throughout. But Gump's naiveté and innocence are his only defining characteristics; as a result, he's likeable but incredibly boring. Robin Wright is very good as Jenny, who is a vastly more interesting character than Gump but still something of a cliché, whilst Gary Sinise is very good as Lieutenant Dan Taylor, but who is no better written than Jenny and is basically Ron Kovic writ small and with the anti-war activism removed.
What does impress about the film is the direction. Zemeckis' long fascination with technology makes him well suited to special effects that allow dead famous people to appear in the film and incorporate newsreel footage, often with Gump added. Visually, the film is distinctive right from the opening shot of the feather drifting down to land at Gump's feet. There are lots of nice touches, for example when Hanks plays Gump's Ku Klux Klan ancestor in a brief flashback shot, and Sinise plays Taylor's ancestors dying in various wars throughout history in another. The cinematography is glorious and makes the film look amazing. The soundtrack consists almost entirely of songs from the various periods in which the film is set and is one of the best things about the movie.
Few could deny the talent involved into making Forrest Gump, or that it's beautifully made and acted. Ultimately however, it's pretty but very superficial.",

1107,31 October 2022,madanmarwah,7, Performance by Tom Hanks is the highlight,"Like many others I also saw this movie once again after many years in order to compare it with its Indian adaptation "" Lal Singh Chaddha"". Such an exercise of comparison is always interesting. The movie remains a memorable one basically for the fine interpretation of the title role by Tom Hanks. ( In later years Tom had surpassed this portrayal with his superlative acting in Terminal, Castaway, Sully and Captain Phillips.) The movie chronicles the life of Forrest Gump from childhood ( Below average IQ, dysfunctional legs) to his later years of service in the Army and from being branded a "" stupid boy "" to his brave acts in an army battle. There is something endearing about Forrest's approach to life and love as he navigates through various events in his life. His girlfriend Jenny is elusive and his endeavors to get her don't work out. Director Robert Zemekis creates a memorable narrative as Forrest philosophically mentions that "" Life is box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get "" and when asked why he was running for 3 years 2 months he says that he just ""felt like running."" Why does he stop ? Because he was tired. Specially worth mentioning are his short meetings with Presidents JFK, Nixon and Johnson with the handshake created with special effects. Tom Hanks had acted superbly and had won the academy award. Sally Field as his mom gave good support.",

Not one person talks about Forest Gump nor regards it as the best or one of the best of the 90s. Pulp Fiction, on the other hand was made for around $8 mill and grossed over $100 million. Shawshank is just a cinematic fest, from acting, cinematography, to directing. Alas Oscars are garbage for the most pc movies.

It was a very interesting movie let you see all the important events that took time in this place. It was also cool how they used Forest Gump and showed his views on it and how he was able to overcome a lot of the difficult tasks such as when he went to Vietnam. My favorite scenes were when he played the ping pong game and also when he went to war in Vietnam. That part was very good because it showed what it was like during that time. The movie was also very good because it provided a moral lesson and showed the struggles Forest Gump had to overcome and it thought you to be kind to people and accept them for who they are.

Over the course of the movie I felt myself drawn to Forrest's quest to get the love of his life Jenny. Though many times it seems as though they may be together, some force separates them until the end where she ultimately dies. My favorite character is the film is Bubba, Forrest's friend which he meets in Vietnam but is killed in battle, Forrest ends up taking over Bubba's shrimping company which turns wildly successful. This relationship is a perfect example of Forrest's unconditional love and friendship for multiple characters throughout the movie causing many tear jerking scenes.",

The storyline of a young simple lad growing up listening to every word his ""Mama"" says and trying to make friends as any other child would, but he was different because of his back was bent so he had to wear braces on his legs. But there was one little girl that was friendly to him 'Jenny' she would stick up for him. Which turns into a life-long friendship. And as you find out as the story goes on it shows that even people with a low IQ can do very well in life. This film also has a very important and very true phrase at the end ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get"" this is a lovely film for anyone really. You will be crying at some points, smiling at some points and some points you will be shouting at the screen. In all it is as My summary says 'The best film ever made!'.",
1129,15 September 2014,CinePhile-istine,6," The bastard child of ""Being There"" and ""Zelig""","Somehow, I had not seen this movie when it first came out. I guess it became so big so quickly that it gave me some pause. Everything I had heard about it made me feel that it was going to be one of those cloying, hyper-sentimental Oscar-baits that come out late in the year. After the safe distance of 20 years - and almost as a bet with a friend - I finally got around to seeing it. While I probably didn't hate it as much as I would have in 1994, I still don't understand why it was such a phenomenon in 1994 (were the movies really that bad in the 90s?). I still don't think of it as highly original; it certainly has very strong echoes of ""Being There"" and ""Zelig"" (and it certainly is not a good sign when a movie reminds you of so many other, better movies). Overall it is a pretty competent bit of film-making with decent acting (though you can see the seams of the ""acting"").",
1130,6 January 2022,AscendeSuperius,9, A tragic beauty,"There was much to love about this film. First and foremost the plot. It was clever of it to weave Forrest Gump into all the significant events that happen in America. And it was a good one, with comedy, good comedy unlike cheap slapstick humour, forming a keystone of the story. With the film being shrouded with the grief of a bittersweet romance is the cherry on top.",

As a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gump endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so perfectly understated that Forrest Gump's travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history only became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us.",

My family and I found the movie to keep us engaged from start to finish and still keeps us engaged when we discuss those lean years financially. Forest, you are all we had! The southern setting was perfect for the movie and the cinematography didn't skimp on giving us an eyeful of how people live down there. Love the south. The interaction between Forest and the events through the time line were well interlaced and seemed to explain when some of those events were the way they were. A great Saturday night movie.",

1146,24 October 2016,balamuruganp,7," The movie is a film adaptation of the book ""Forrest Gump""",When I first saw this movie I didn't appreciate it like I do now. I think it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there's no hope... I just love this movie.

1150,5 October 2010,dudesweethej,10, A brilliant and well-made picture,"***Spoiler Alert*** Forrest Gump is one of the most impactive, respected and popular films of the 90's. Widely considered one of the best films o all time, and while this is very subjective, the depth of this film in itself should be enough to at least make people accept its brilliance. In case you don't know, Forrest Gump is in fact a symbol of America. The story follows the main character, who, while not being the sharpest nor most intelligent main character alive, still manages to somehow just do the right things, attain success, and always make the best of others... Don't get too excited now though, cause while we have the naive, well-meaning Forrest, for whom life isn't too serious, we've also get Jenny, who ends up as the opposite. A symbol of everything rotten within America. Don't get it wrong, she's not an antagonist, actually it's just the sad irony, that Forrest, who attains everything by luck and good intentions, Jenny, who has all the ordinary traits and possibilities which Forrest do not have, simply picks all the wrong choices. So much for the American Dream... While these two characters respectively journeys through the best and worst periods of the country, there's always a somewhat romantic relationship between the two, which of course has to result in a child. Forrest Gump deserves just as much attention as it got. Everything form acting to directing to filming is perfect, and while one could keep up the endless discussion bout which of it and Pulp Fiction deserved the Best Film Award, the outcome shouldn't bother too many... Incredibly intelligent and exciting film...",

Starting in the 50s and ending in the 90s it takes American history and parodies it. Tom Hanks and story is very charming and goes from beat to beat well. My main problem with it is that it feels patronizing you know if you were so simple, you could very easily find your American dream. Sure Forrest gets confronted with reality a couple of times but the script magically moves him on with no trouble. The final flaw is the ending where the script twists and you are supposed to be face to face with some kind of meaning, but there is none to be found.",

1165,9 December 1999,macpherr,10, The script is brilliant!,"""Forrest Gump"" Tom Hanks ( Sleepless in Seattle) is one of my favorite characters in all the movies that I have ever seen. That covers a lot of movies.  Every time I watch the movie,  I start talking like Forrest, Forrest Gump. His transparency, his sincerity, his naivete, his sense of commitment toward his friends is beyond what anyone could imagine. We watched the movie again when we were visiting relatives for Thanksgiving. Uncle Gene was cracking up. He is a WWII veteran.  He loved that line: ""I got a million dollars wound but so far I have not seen one cent of it!"" After two days of talking like Forrest, Forrest Gump,  my husband looked at me and said: ""now you sound like Katharine Hepburn."" I think that one the reasons that I adore and understand Forrest is because he ""lived"" through my years as a young adult. The script is brilliant! Clever, clever, clever! The movie touches everyone. The older folks, because they lived through it as adults; baby bloomers because they lived through it as young adults; even the kids in my neighborhood will scream: "" run,  Forrest, run."" Every time they see someone running. My favorite quote: Bubba Blue, Mykelti Williamson (Primary Colors) said: ""Anyway, like I was saying', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, sautee it. Dey's uh, shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich. That- that's about it."". My favorite scenes: Forrest showing his buttocks to the President. When he sees ""Jeannie"" (Message in the Bottle) in Washington, D.C., they meet at the pool of the ellipse. They were again briefly like peas and carrots! Forrest sees ""Lieutenant Dan"" Gary Senise (Apollo 13), he jumps into the ocean and his boat crashes! The little feather that flies at the beginning and end of movie. The music is great! This is one of the best movies ever made and that is all I have to say about that!",

Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a mentally challenged man who just happens to make history over his life.  He makes history like inspiring Elvis's dance, the smiley face and all sorts of stuff.  He is great playing Forrest and I enjoyed him all the way.  Sally Field, Gary Sinise, and Mykelti Williamson were all really good as the other characters who help Forrest in his life. Robin Wright is also very good as Jenny, the one and only person that Forrest loves and also gets some history in her.  I enjoyed everyone's performance and Robert Zemeckis made himself a true gem here.  He's a great director alone but this made him one of the best.",

I first watched when I was 9 years old when I was in China. It was really hard for me understand of the messages the film try to deliver. As I grow up, I have been watching this film from time to time, and I start to understand the history of African American getting equal rights in the society, the fact that Jenny had a miserable childhood and why she was so rebellent as she grow up, and history of Vietnam war, John Lennon, JFK...etc. I can almost always learn something new about the film every time I watch it. This film always inspires me to question my life. As ""normal"" people with normal IQ scores, we though we know what are important and what are things we want. We won't spend time on things that seem not important, and be make decisions and choices based on that. But for Gump, he never made a conscious choice on those important decision in his life: play football, join army, make friend with the shrimp guy, play Pingpong, running cross the country. He didn't choose to do any of these things. Just like the famous line from the movie: Life is like a box of chocolate, and you never know what you will choose. And the feather flying in the sky at the beginning and the end of the film, was the a prefect visual metaphor of this line and Gump's life.",

The irony and satire of the novel is still there, but Hanks's performance and Zemeckis's direction is what makes it beautiful. One of the best sentimental films of all time! Zemeckis weaves Hanks into archive footage and his combination of satire and sentimentality is what makes this masterpiece so beautiful and effective.

Growing up,he joins the US army fighting in Vietnam war,initiates shrimp business returning from the battlefield to keep words of his loving friend. And at a time,goes for a world tour on foot bearing the pain of separation. But this apparent unbelievable story introduces some amazing dreams in our eyes and bewitching feelings in our brain,which outgrow its unlikelihood. We fancy believing this improbable story,because Forrest's apparent 'idiocy','madness'and simpleness resemble something outstanding. Forrest seems personality-less since throughout the movie he complies to other's direction,whereas deep inside it projects a profound experiment of belief on humanity.

This is Tom Hanks's greatest hour - it shows that he is versatile, skilled, and cares very much about his roles. Forrest Gump himself was a nice guy - but not in a nice world, and this earned him a lot of ridicule and humiliation on the way. But it is good to see how he deals with this, and to see life through the eyes of a lesser-intelligent person is something that makes this film truly special.",

Its the story of Forrest Gump who just took what life threw at him & ran away with it. The humor in this film is amazing, so many laugh out loud moments of great irony. Tom Hanks is the heart and soul of the film, this pure-hearted innocent human being whose infectious love & positivity gets him and others through deeply tragic situations. Our heart cries when he finally shows his emotions. Its a legendary performance deserving of all the accolades he got. The score by Alan Silvestri is such a memorable & uplifting one.

Forest Gump is a simple man with a simple heart but he sure knows how to tell a story. This is my favorite movie of all time and I wish I could watch it again for the first time. I find that the worst part of the movie is the ending with Jennie. I think the only thing that disturbs me is that Jennie only comes to Forest when she is sick and no one else will take her and then she left... I felt as if Forest deserved more respect than that.
