0,18 March 2010,DICK STEEL,10, A Nutshell Review: How to Train Your Dragon,"If this is done following the same old beat up formula that Hollywood sticks to with regards to animation, then the dragons will be yakking non-stop. Thank goodness that this film, directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, avoids this like the plague, and ",/
1,20 June 2010,The_Fifth_Echo,10, One of the most Breathtaking Animated Films of all time.,"I watched How to Train Your Dragon about 5 times now, and it never gets boring. It actually keeps on getting better and better with with more and more views. This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet. It is an amazing experience to watch this film in Cinema. The 3D is amazing and at times Breathtaking. I may of had the most fun that I've ever had in Cinema watching How to Train Your Dragon.",r
2,12 April 2010,Simon_Says_Movies,9, Will enamour kids and enthrall adults,"With a somewhat unwieldy tile and the lack of the winning Pixar storyline that has dominated the Oscars for a decade, Dreamworks animations latest could have been a clunker. Not only is How to Train Your Dragon the best film of the year so far, but it even eclipses the quality of last years duel academy award winner Up.",e
3,8 March 2010,tollini,10, Truly Moving Picture,"I saw this film in early March, of 2010 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award.

4,13 May 2018,AlsExGal,9, One of my favorite films of the last decade...,"...not that this is necessarily saying much, since the films of the past decade are either made for the Academy Awards with some social message that hits the audience over the head with a social justice sledgehammer, or they are action films with lots of car chases and explosions and comic book heroes or they are 50 shades of obscene. But I digress. ",i
5,19 December 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Amazing, the best Dreamworks film in a long time","I love animation, always have done, always will do, and I was blown away by How to Train Your Dragon. Granted, not all Dreamworks movies are bad, Prince of Egypt is one of the most stirring and evocative films let alone animated films I have seen, Shrek was very original and funny and Spirit:Stallion of the Cimarron is their most underrated I feel. I will say too, How to Train Your Dragon along with Prince of Egypt is my absolute favourite of Dreamworks, and one of the best of 2010.",e
6,15 August 2018,gogoschka-1,10, A Beautiful Tale Of Adventure And Friendship For People Of All Ages,"Warning: this beautifully animated tale is highly addictive! As soon as it's over you'll immediately want to watch it again. I'm a grown man, but somehow this movie managed to ignore all the layers of cynicism and fake toughness we grown-ups tend to build around ourselves to cope with life; it cut right through to the wide-eyed, adventure-loving boy in me, right through to the heart. It's impossible not to fall in love with this movie, with these characters - especially if you love wild animals. This beautiful story of a very unlikely friendship between a boy who's a bit of an outcast and a dragon is just so well done; it's never cheesy, yet full of passion, and there's simply not a dull moment in it.",w
7,3 November 2010,zeletto,10, A heartfelt movie with a beautiful message,"There are a lot of excellent reviews out there, I will just discuss a single point. What got to me the most in this movie is the message I got out of it, I got it from a single line uttered by the hero and it just burned in my memory, it's about how when we look deep in the eyes of our enemies -the ones we fear the most- we will see that they are afraid of us just as we are afraid of them, we might realize their humanity and that they are not what we thought, monsters.",/
8,20 March 2010,me_sterya,10," Wonderful movie, a must see 3D","I saw the trailer and I enjoyed it but I was afraid that all the good parts from the movie will be there and that will be all, like it was with many films lately. That was certainly not the case. There are way better parts that were left to be discovered and I definitely congratulate the choice.",r

10,30 April 2010,planktonrules,10, It's so good it boggles the mind!,"When I saw this film tonight, I was completely bowled over from start to finish. I have simply never seen a better looking computer generated film nor a film that used 3-D to such wonderful effect. Finally--a film that doesn't look like the 3_D doesn't look like it was tossed in as an afterthought--but was clearly intended as one all along. However, I will warn you NOT to waste your time seeing it in 2-D---the film loses too much of its artistry. Now I know some of you will think I am a total sap for saying this, but the film literally brought tears to my eyes because it was so beautiful. I simply couldn't believe how special and artistic this movie was--it completely exceeded my expectations. This is because the advertising campaign make this movie look like it's just another kids' movie--and nothing more. But, with a lovely plot, interesting characters, the best CGI on Earth, a terrific sound track and lots of surprises, this simply is a joy to watch. Nornally when I review a film I try to talk about the film's flaws...but I simply couldn't find any. At last, a 3-D CGI film that actually manages to be better looking than last year's ""Up""! It is hard to imagine a film being any better--though I am sure five years from now, I will be seeing even better 3-D and computer generated films...and it boggles the mind! See this film!",4

12,24 September 2019,sazzad_h_akm,10, Why I gave it 10,"I'm not a big fan of animation but I like this movie very much. I consider this is the greatest animation movie created so far. This movie is constituted by great story line, splendid background music, amazing animation and breathtaking brawls.
As for the story line, I can tell that it is very unique as well as heart touching. That's one thing, you will definitely enjoy while watching the movie. One will enjoy wild but growing friendship between Hiccup and the dragon. A good story line along with satisfactory and delightful background music makes this movie prominent.
On the other hand superb and impeccable animation will draw you into the chair until the movie is finished. Fight scenes are spectacular and humorous. I'm pretty sure that after watching this movie everyone will watch it multiple times.",2
13,12 September 2012,micz81,10, If you feel that Toy Story and Shreck are missing SOMETHING IMPORTANT - this movie is for you,"It's far better then all those Shrecks, Toy stories, Ratatoulies, Puss in boots, Mega-minds and other ""renewing"" concepts. Why? It's simple and honest. This movie doesn't TRY to be funny, modern, super-wise, and ""for all"". It's not one of those ""hey-let's-make-a-movie-about-cat-who-is-a-super-spy"" concepts. This movie JUST tells the simple yet very good story in the most proper way.",8
14,14 March 2010,velvet_remedy,9, Genuinely superb and a step forward in 3D films,"HTTYD is the latest in a run of animated 3D films to hit the family market. One might be forgiven for feeling a little weary of this genre as the big production studios churn out one ""action-packed film with a cute central character and some pretty effects"" after another. But wait...",0
15,21 March 2010,3xHCCH,10, Do Not Let the Trailer Discourage You. This is Very Good!,"The trailer of this movie was so unpromising and unattractive. It did not make me want to watch this, in 3D no less. However, my kids all wanted to watch it, so of course, my wife and I had to go with them.",6
16,3 April 2010,movietaster,8," Most moving, spiritually enriched 3D movie you have ever seen!","I am not at all interested in dragons and all such fantasy creatures. I don't like children movies with all their stupid messages. I saw this movie rather just to pass the time than to watch it for its sake. And Whoa! I was drawn in this river in first 5 minutes. And what a experience it has been! Right from the start as the narrator describes his world, you are immediately there. You feel yourself in the characters place. The movie does that for you. This is very uncommon movie and it has set a milestone for 3D, not because of its technical aspects, but because of the Depth this movie has. This movie is as much for a 7 year old as it is for an old man who has seen a lot of life. This movie will entertain each viewer in his own way. This is a masterpiece! This movie isn't what it sounds on the surface. It has layers of meanings attached to it. Look at just the title: How to train your Dragon!. If you see it carefully you will notice that there is more to it than meets the eye. Watch the movie and you will know what i mean. This movie cleverly comments on Human Fear, War, Friendship, prejudices, courage, Love. ........................... Don't miss this movie or you will miss one of the few periods when you really LIVE. Note: Just remember to carry your heart with you when you see this movie. It will fill your heart with nothing but what should truly belong there. 10/10.",0
17,16 February 2017,bans_004,10," Watched it a 100 times, and...","it's still managed to make me smile, laugh, tear up and excited every time. And I can still watch it a hundred more times, even at this age loooong past my teens, and still be as entertained as the first time round. This has the perfect dosage of wit, humor, drama, action, scattered bits of suspense and...the perfect team of the six riders. The twins never cease to bring that giggle back, even with their old pathetic jokes. I mean, who would've thought to make a voice cast of Jay Baruchel...which has now become almost iconic! Such a perfect amount of time spent on the build-up; especially the bonding; and the climax. It has one of the best (thought through) story lines. Congratulations to the Dreamsworks team on a job well done. And of course to Cressida Crowell for her creations.",/
18,15 March 2010,axel_foley,9, this is why you go to the movies,"incredible! certainly the front runner for the best animated film of the year. from the first to the last frame this film is as good as an animated film gets on almost every level. beautifully written, designed and executed. though an incredible movie, it's not quite perfection - probably due to time and budget limitations (is there ever enough of either?). that said, the problems i had are far too few to mention. if dragon doesn't absolutely slay at the box office i'll lose faith in middle America.

19,12 August 2017,mlitvinava,10, My favourite animated film,"There's a reason why I watched How To Train Your Dragon 7 times when it was still playing in theatres. No, it wasn't because I was young and didn't know how to better manage my money (although to be honest, it was a little bit of this). It's because HTTYD had a unique way of unfolding its story. A story about an unlikely relationship that truly moved my heart--between the now very well-known dynamic-duo, Hiccup and Toothless.",r
20,27 March 2010,saarvardi,10, The best 2010 release I've seen so far â€“ and one of the best animated films to hit theaters in a very long time,"I remember watching the adorable Disney flick Lilo & Stitch at the theater back in the summer of 2002, after a truly exhausting week. The film - which tells the story of a small girl that befriends a wacky alien she mistakes for a dog - managed to put an enormous smile on my face, and made me forget of all my other worries for a while.",e

This is the best movie I've seen since the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Virtually everything about it is wonderful. Rarely have I been so drawn in to an animated movie. The 3D aspects are thrilling and the movie has a great story, amazing animation, non stop action and a positive and constructive message. It made me want to go out and get a pet dragon. This movie is perfect for people of all ages. Now I know what a feel good movie is. This movie will make everyone feel good. Congratulations to all who contributed to this amazing film. It will make toy dragons a popular gift item. Hope to see it again and again. 3D at it's best.",f

24,24 March 2010,TourettesPersonal,10, Almost as good as Pixar movies.,"Dreamworks Animated movies were usually silly funny, crazy, not serious, heartless and forgettable like ""Monsters vs. Aliens"", ""Shark Tale"". but sometimes there are movies that are great, sometimes serious and memorable like ""Kung Fu Panda"". ""How to train your Dragon"" is one of those great movies. The voice casting was perfect, the animation was awesome, great screenplay and music score. it has a lot of action and exciting scenes. ""How to Train your Dragon"" is the best Dreamworks Animated movie ever. ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is better than d' book. The action scenes were awesome, The movie is funny too and the cinematography was amazing. The part when Hiccup was riding on Toothless is better than Jake Sully riding on Banshees from ""AVATAR"". This movie is fun especially in 3D! Gerard Butler was perfect for Stoick the Vast. Jay Baruchel was good. but America Ferrera's performance was bad. This is better than ""AVATAR"" and ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"". ""How to Train your Dragon"" is the best animated movie i watched this year. and this movie gave me goosebumps.",t
25,14 March 2010,zahid_c,8, Visually Stunning,"An animated feast for the eyes is a brilliant description for this film. From the jaw-dropping visuals beautifully rendered in 3D, to the flawless animation of the characters and dragons, this was one film that didn't disappoint.",t
26,20 March 2010,helmutty,8, Entertaining fun romp,"How to Train Your Dragon may not have a complex plot but its plot with the help of its 3D is engaging enough to keep my eyes glued to the screen. It is also a fun light movie that kids can enjoy. Alice in Wonderland may be a little dark for them. This has some scary/intense scenes with the dragons but it should be fine for the kids as most of the dragons appeal to them. DreamWork movies now are usually 3D and Pixar is following after it. I think DreamWork movies keep improving. I actually find this better than its last movie, Monsters Vs Aliens.",_
27,2 January 2011,gsic_batou,8," Great fun, even for adults","Here's an animated movie that has everything it should have, an inspired, but simple story without jokes intended for the adult parents who have to sit with their kids in the theater. In ""How to train a dragon"", it is the majestic artwork that keeps the viewer engaged, with a mix of funny, colored characters and a less heavy handed screenplay than those of pixar. In some ways that should detract from the movie, but somehow it all works into great fun that takes a grown man back to the fun of childhood.",u

30,25 January 2023,seruanyre,10, Dragonfire: How to Train Your Dragon soars to new heights,"""How to Train Your Dragon"" is an emotionally gripping animated film that tells the story of a young Viking boy named Hiccup and his unlikely friendship with a dragon. The animation is breathtaking, with the dragons being brought to life in a way that is both realistic and fantastical. The story is also well-written and emotionally resonant, with themes of acceptance, friendship, and coming of age. The voice acting is top-notch, with Jay Baruchel delivering a standout performance as Hiccup. Overall, ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is a masterfully crafted film that appeals to audiences of all ages and is sure to be a classic in the animation genre.",
31,13 February 2011,pc95,9, The best animated movie since Wall-E,"I remembered hearing my cousin stating how much she enjoyed this movie in the Spring-time upon it's release. Feel sorry I missed it's outing in the theater. It is a gem of a production - better than Toy Story 3 or Despicable Me. ""How to Train Your Dragon"" captures the magic that any good live-action movie has done in the past with animals. It is masterfully put together with a great balance of humor and adventure. The dragon training scenes and friendship alone is worth watching the movie - the other core characters and story are just ""icing on the cake"". I just hope they leave it alone for sequels. Great movies do not need them.",
32,8 August 2012,mat-mcnaughton-254-33257,10, Perfect.,"I can't even begin to talk about why I love this film so much. For starters, the voice casting is amazing. Jay Baruchel is a great protagonist, America Ferrera is a wonderful female lead/love interest. People like Gerard Butler (as King Leonidas) and Craig Ferguson (as Craig Ferguson) play off each other so well, and the other teens (T.J. Miller, Kristen Wiig, etc.) were good supporting characters.",

35,24 December 2020,AlbertCinefilu,10, I usually write a review after I've just seen the movie but...,"...this is one of the films that made me love movies when I was a kid. I will never forget that ''emotionfull'' moment when Stirbul (in Romanian Night Fury's name was ''Toothless'', based on a moment in the movie when Night Fury smiled and Hiccup saw that he doesn't have teeth) let Sughits (Hiccup) touch him for the first time. It felt magic, powerful, almost poetic, something I wouldn't see on the Romanian television that started to consider that kids need mindless entertainment and nothing more.",

38,1 April 2010,neil-476,9, Grabs you - very good,"I'm beginning to think that the people who make CGI features have got it pegged a lot better than those who make live action movies. So often they seem to have a good story, an excellent script, cracking characterisation, and fabulous visuals.",

43,13 May 2010,zardoz-13,10, Vikings Versus Dragons!!!,"This groundbreaking animated actioneer from co-directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders about a teenager who grows up on an island that flying dragons constantly raid is terrific from fade-in to fade-out. Basically, ""How To Train Your Dragon"" tackles the theme of intolerance. Hiccup is the son of an intimidating Viking warrior chief, Stoick (Gerard Butler of ""Gamer""),and the Vikings have been waging a war with the dragons since the dawn of time and killing them. Nevertheless, the dragons keep on coming back to raid the island of its livestock and fishing hauls. Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel of ""She's Out of my League"")dreams of becoming a Viking, but his dear old dad is pretty dubious about the prospect of his son having anything remotely to do with combat. Hiccup wields a small cannon with a projectile that looks like a net to trap a dragon. Hiccup doesn't trap just any dragon. The dragon that Hiccup brings down is an exotic specimen that his Viking ancestors have left virtually blank in their recognition manual of dragons. Eventually, Hiccup discovers the poor little dragon trapped in the depression of a lake because it cannot attain enough altitude to escape. It seems that one part of the dragon's tale fins that stabilize its ability to fly is missing. Relying on his ingenuity, Hiccup fashions a prosthesis so that will enable the little fellow to fly. Of course, all of this is like the scene in a venerable western where the kid tames a horse and learns how to ride it. Hiccup winds up calling the dragon by the nickname of 'Toothless.' When the dragon isn't prepared to chow down, it appears as if it doesn't have teeth, but Toothless does have teeth. Naturally, Hiccup's father is impressed when a fellow Viking tells him that Hiccup isn't the waste of breath that his father believes that he is. Indeed, Hiccup and his father sit down and have their first face-to-face conversation together because they have something to share.",
44,27 March 2010,guptaena,10, A Wonderful Surprise,"How to Train Your Dragon is probably the best Dreamworks picture I have ever seen.

46,23 December 2010,Floated2,7, Visually entertaining,"There's lots of very dynamic exciting action in this movie and it's mostly done with a cheerful fun tone most of the time even though there's still danger. However, despite that lack of ""realism"", I do think that adults will enjoy it a lot too. The story is not the most original (except for the original premise) but it's very well told, with good character development and has a fairly good morale for those into that. The effects and animation is stunning. Very well done.The story was entertaining to watch and it didn't really drag on like other animated films. One thing I didn't really like, is that there's a part of the ending that we've seen a hundred times before especially in kids movies and I would have preferred a little more originality there or at least see it better done because I didn't really buy into it. Very clichÃ©d and should have been better in my opinion",
47,31 January 2022,AntonyZ-UC,10," Perfect in every aspect, a masterpiece","How to Train Your Dragon shows how a animation movie can be more than a movie, the storyline of it is perfect, it shows how hiccup is the worst viking of the island, he literally is afraid of dragons, that the other ones kill, but he was the first one to ride one, the ending for me is perfect, this movie looks like just another kids movie, but it's just much more than that, definetly perfect in every aspect, can't describe it less than a masterpiece.",

By the time the movie was released I was hearing a lot about it, from friends and critics and shows on TV, so I decided to watch it, not in 3D to my dismay. At the beginning my expectations were high, seeing as there was quite a lot of hype about this movie, however I didn't expect it would be this good. It DEFINITELY exceeded my expectations.

51,11 June 2012,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,10, A truly moving CGI animated epic from such a great animation company!,"Seeing as how Dreamworks Animation continues to become #5 of the animation companies and has worked on both traditional animated features along with computer animated ones. Some of them (Prince of Egypt, Road to El Dorado, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, Shrek 1, 2 and 4, Kung Fu Panda 1-2, Monsters VS Aliens, Madagascar 1-2) are my favorites and some of them aren't my favorites and were quite weak for the company (Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas, Shark Tale, Bee Movie), although Megamind was pretty good even though it wasn't a masterpiece. Before and after those films, they made their very first take on a story the fantasy genre two years ago: A tale of vikings fighting against dragons, but only one person can make the difference to make peace with them. How To Train Your Dragon, directed by Disney animator Chris Sanders, is that story and upon it's release, it was hugely praised by the critics and had almost gained an 100%.",
52,15 August 2018,cricketbat,6, Talked up too much,"I liked How to Train Your Dragon, but not as much as everyone else seemed to. Maybe it was just talked up too much.

53,9 November 2017,classicsoncall,7," ""We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard.""","Animated features are usually very colorful and offer a whole lot of fun, but I don't understand how they manage to score so high against your more prevalent live action movies. I think it has to do with viewers rating each one on a personal standard against other animated films, with the result having pictures like this winding up with a rating above 8.0. So as I write this, the film ranks higher in the IMDb Top #250 than ""Platoon"", ""Hotel Rwanda"" and 1959's ""Ben Hur"". Anyone see the irony in that? I don't know that there's a way to fix that other than to separate animated movies into their own category, but I don't know if that would be fair either. Anyway, that's my little side spiel.",

I could tell right from the start that the storyline of the movie had nothing to do with the storyline of the book (except for the names of a few of the characters involved). I am surprised the book even mentions that it is now a ""major motion picture"" considering you can hardly even compare the two.",

The fighting scenes in the movie were wonderful, the graphics and animation in the movie were wonderful, I liked all the main characters, the best Dreamworks films that I watched and the best American animated film, not counting the Disney and Pixar films.",
56,5 April 2010,tavm,9, How to Train Your Dragon was a wonderfully inspiring animated tale from DreamWorks Animation,"Just watched this 3-D computer animated movie with my movie theatre friend who had seen this a couple of times before. It's an awesome tale of a young man named Hiccup (voice of Jay Baruchel) wanting to become a real Viking like his dad, Stoick (Gerald Butler). But one thing he doesn't want to do is kill dragons especially when he befriends one he names Toothless...While there's some witty lines and some humorous visuals, this was a mainly compellingly stirring adventure tale about standing up for your principals despite the prevailing mood of the crowd. I'll leave it at that and just mention the other voices that were heard here: America Ferrera, Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Kristen Wiig, and, the only one I actually recognized while watching, Craig Ferguson. All of those and others contributed wonderful performances.

57,30 December 2015,Horst_In_Translation,6, How to make a good animated film,"""How to Train Your Dragon"" is an animated feature film from five years ago that was nominated for two Academy Awards. It lost Score to ""The Social Network"" and ""Animated Feature"" to ""Toy Story 3"". Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders directed this film and they were also 2 of the 4 people who adapted Cressida Cowell's book so successfully for the big screen. A second film followed and also a television series plus several short films that were mostly added as DVD material. I will not go a lot into detail about who the voice actors here are. You can check that in the list of cast and credits. The movie runs for slightly under 90 minutes not counting the credits and thus it is a bit shorter than the sequel, but not by much.",

With one of these inventions, during an attack, he manages to hunt a dragon that lands some distance from the village but no one believes in him. Why? Had he lied before? The next day he finds the dragon but instead of killing it releases it, that way forming both a bond of friendship. In this way the little viking learns to tame dragons, and I find it incredibly stupid that in training classes no one realizes that he is just playing with the bugs. The story goes on with a few more conveniences, such as the love interest that seemed forced only after a little ride on the dragon's back. Some more conveniences happen that give rise to a hunt for the big giant dragon but the end of the film surprises in a sad way because the adventure cost a foot. It has good rhythm and action, but formulaic story full of clichÃ©s and stereotypes. Funny but little more.",

If you like an animated movie with a wonderful story that delves into character development, then How to Train Your Dragon is for you. How to Train Your Dragon is the best family animated film I have seen in a long, long time. The characters are wonderfully written. We see the friendship between Hiccup (the main character) and Toothless (the dragon) develop through their awkwardness, fear of each other (at first) and their attempts to understand one another. We see the story of a young viking who does not fit in being able to use his other gifts to become a viable part of his society. The film is well written overall. It has some of the standards outcast type situations, but those are the things that make outcast movies so endearing. The film looks marvelous.

87,14 November 2014,brchthethird,9, Spectacular animation + emotionally resonant story = pure enjoyment,"Here's yet another great film that I missed the boat on initially. I typically stay away from kid's movies (save classic Disney) because they tend to be overly simplistic bores that would only entertain the youngest of children. HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is one of best of the lot, however, because of its excellent animation and a compelling story with themes that will resonate with viewers of all ages. The movie takes place in an indeterminate time period when Vikings and dragons coexisted, although not peacefully as the beginning makes perfectly clear. They're mortal enemies, in fact, and Vikings train from a very young age to be able to kill the beasts who raid their village and steal their livestock. Everyone, that is, except Hiccup. Hiccup is what you could call an outcast or a reject. He wants to join his peers in training, but nobody ever seems to want to give him a chance. Fortunately, he gets one, though not in the way you'd expect. As the title indicates, there is some dragon training that goes down, but not without a serious paradigm shift. At its core, this movie is about a young boy who doesn't quite fit in, yet finds a way to make himself valuable to the people around him. There is also a subtext about learning to empathize and/or come to terms with things that we don't understand, and therefore fear. Both of these messages are very pertinent to people, young and old, and are dealt with in a mature, yet accessible way. For the kids, you have the spectacle of expertly animated flying sequences and a killer battle with the big-bad dragon. For adults (and more discerning children), you have the meatier stuff about acceptance and overcoming your fears. It's really one of the best animated films I've ever seen, on multiple levels. While DreamWorks might have made their name with Shrek, I think that this will have a bit more staying power in years to come. In fact, this is so good that it pains me to even gripe about a single thing, so I'll make it brief. The setup of the movie is a bit roughly handled, and the characters (initially) aren't really given their due. But the movie improves drastically as it progresses, so much so that you almost forget the slightly weak first act. Overall, this is a movie I see myself watching again and again, and I'll definitely be checking out the sequel. Do yourself a favor and go watch this right now. You'll be glad you did.",
88,30 May 2010,montera_iulian,7," Well Executed, Good Movie But Not Impressed...","How to train your dragon is another good animation provided by DreamWorks where the main character is a viking boy named Hiccup who is more like the kid-with-brain than the kid-with-muscles. He always wanted to prove himself worthy in battling real dragons but life decided for him that he will prove worthy to himself by understanding those creatures. He somehow manages by luck to hurt and ""catch"" the ""Night Fury"", the dragon everyone wanted to catch, but instead of killing him he finds his own fear and loneliness into Fury's eyes, making him to spare his life.

97,2 January 2011,FilmFanatic03,8," At first it seems shallow and boring, but after the second watch you see the heart within the story","When i first saw this film at the cinema i thought it had no heart and was quite shallow. The thing that annoyed me was that this son of the chief spoke in an American accent when everyone else (apart from some teens) spoke in a Scottish accent, they all should have had one type of accent. But after watching it a second time i saw the heart of the story and the emotion between Toothless and Hiccup. It is very uplifting and so enjoyable to watch. I live Toothless, he's just plain cool and cute, i want a dragon like that one!!! But i think the journey Hiccup takes is extraordinary and its great to see how he grows in confidence but still remains the down to earth kid that we see at the beginning and he doesn't loose that quality through the film. It had humorous moments in with some of the characters which kept the spirit up in this film. The ending is very uplifting and i wonder how they are going to follow on with a sequel which is planned to be released in 2013. The CGI is amazing, it's so polished and modern and it feels fresh. I do think that if you don't like this film at first, at least watch it again and you'll love it soon enough, i'm sure of it. DreamWorks have hit a goldmine with this one.",

Seeing a movie in 3D, after all, wouldn't change my opinion on if it was a good or bad film. As usual, the animation is delivered is beautiful, no surprise there.

When this film came out in 2010, I was enraptured and astonished by the beauty and colour of this northern world with its stalwart Viking society and wonderful variety of dragons. Who was responsible for that? Art director Pierre-Olivier Vincent? I'm sure it was a whole team of people. The 3D effects are spectacular. The engaging and heartwarming story (based on a book by Cressida Cowell) hits home for both kids and adults. Hiccup, the little Viking who could, is a great character. Some of it is clichÃ©, but it didn't matter. Yes, I know it's a movie for kids, but there was something clever about it that raised it to a level that adults can appreciate. Kudos to DeBlois, Davies and Sanders for bringing us this imaginative, evocative and, yes, magical film. It's going to be hard to beat this in 2014, but they can certainly count on filling the seats.",
100,18 April 2010,zetes,8," Despite the predictable storyline, this is hugely enjoyable","Like all of Dreamworks' animated films, you can pretty much predict every moment of How to Train Your Dragon from the film's opening sequence. In particular, the whole relationship between the father and son in this picture is so banal I had to roll my eyes every time the father character (voiced by Gerard Butler - for some reason, the major adult vikings in the movie all have Scottish accents) appeared on screen. So I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie a heck of a lot. And even after several days, my happiness with it has not diminished. I think most of that has to do with the relationship between the protagonist, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), and the dragon, Toothless. What can I say, I'm a sucker for any story about a person's relationship with their pet, and with the dragon so cat-like, the film was pretty much irresistible. The dragons are all fantastic, and the film truly comes alive whenever any of them (and especially when Toothless) is on screen. But, really, Dreamworks has never done better with their film-making. They've created a nice little world here. It has a texture and a beauty not before seen in Dreamworks animated features (though still a good deal below Pixar's last two films). Their last few films have had really well done action sequences, and Dragons keeps up with that quite nicely, putting the similar dragon flying sequences in Avatar to shame. DeBlois and Sanders previously directed Disney's Lilo & Stitch (pretty obvious when you compare Toothless's design to Stitch's), which has a similar charm.",

104,6 February 2021,Alex_Lo,10, One of my Favourite On-Screen-Friendships,"Like many other representatives of the genre, ""How to train your Dragon"" shows sweet characters, which generate a loud ""Ooohh"" among many younger, and also some older viewers. But ""How to train your Dragon"" stands out from other genre representatives through many elements. On the one hand, the film tells a story. This sounds trivial, but if you take a closer look, the majority of the animated films unfortunately lack a story. On the other hand, the young main character Hiccup is finely portrayed and the relationship with his father adds a beautiful meta-level to the film. In addition, the film delivers well-timed humor in the dialogues and a rousing soundtrack. And even if, for example, the depiction of Toothless follows other genre models, he still remains adorable and does not become a kitsch figure. So it is also this fine balance, which, among the other points mentioned, makes the film entertaining for the little ones as well as for the big ones, and that makes a great animated film for me.",

107,30 March 2010,blackmamba99971,10, Exhilarating,"This was a great film, a legendary kid (Hiccupp)who seems to be the odd ball of the viking bunch befriending a dragon known as a Night Fury. The most powerful of all dragons, with great speed, and fire power. The misconception that dragons are to be feared is a two sided coin. The belief of lore is that in these tales knights would fight and kill these dragons because of their killing sprees, albeit to feed themselves or their young. In fact most stories include dragons as friends to those who protect them. Vikings were one of them, they did fight, but in later tales, they worked with them as close friends to protect each other. But in this tale, Toothless (Night Fury) was one of the special dragons which helped Hiccup believe in himself to fight the most dreaded dragon of them all. A beast with such size and strength, it matches no other. Nearly two hundred feet tall, with an appetite that could match most sumo wrestlers. The gist of this story is most of the dragons raided villages only to feed this monstrosity, and in some ways most of the dragons feared it, being a personal slave to the behemoth. But as luck would have it, Hiccup and his gang of misfits manage to work with their dragons that they trained with in viking school, to finally be rid of the Dreadnaught dragon. Hiccup's father just needed to see it with his own eyes to believe that dragons are not the enemy, and never were. This film had everything, fun, action, laughs, and sadness which compels the human heart or for that matter, a dragons heart. I enjoyed it beginning to end. What a refreshing way to see how the young and old can come to grips with the misconceptions of those long past tales and how the confusion got started in the first place. Brilliant movie.",
108,19 April 2010,theterminateriscoming,10," What can I say, except awesome.","I just returned form viewing HTTYD on the big screen, in 3-D, and I must say that I was very impressed. Very, very impressed. Loosely based on a series of books by the same name HTTYD comes at you form the beginning and never lets up. Never a dull moment, never a wasted shot or scene the story progresses quickly but not so quick that you get lost. HTTYD harks at the magnificent novel, Eragon which was butchered into a film with the same name. Even if your not a huge dragon/fantasy fan you will be drawn into a story of a boy who fails at everything that is expected of him and knows it, a dragon who acts more like a giant cat, an over ambitious girl, and village full of steel-wielding vikings. The film is also hilarious and filled with one liners that have me laughing even now. The story is simple: a village of stubborn vikings battle dragons to survive until a misfit boy learns secret that could change everything. There are also heart felt moments, hilarious moments and the classic ""OH NO!"" and ""OH YEA!"" moments that are the back bone of any classic movie. This movie is, in some ways like the Incredibles but also in a class of its own. There are some moments that might scare younger viewers, a far amount of violence and some sexual references. I saw it with my family all seven of us, an age range form 45 to 6 and every one loved the movie. ",

Just watching the flight sequences was enough for the price of admission, even if none of the characters are even remotely memorable. Watch this movie in theaters or IMAX in 3D or it isn't going to be as good, kids and adults will have a good time watching this, even if the plot is straight forward the pacing however is well done.

111,23 March 2010,C-Younkin,8, Sets the bar for animated 3-D,"""How to Train Your Dragon"", or as I like to call it ""That Viking is out of my League"", is the second film in as many weeks where Jay Baruchel plays a scrawny nerd looking to find himself. It also happens to be infinitely more entertaining. He voices Hiccup, a hapless young Viking living in a village overrun by flying dragons. He longs to be like his great dragon-killing father, Stoick (Gerard Butler), and charm the likes of the beautiful Astrid (America Ferrara), with whom he is enrolled in dragon-battle training. While dragon-killing isn't for him, he soon finds a particular knack for dragon-whispering, subduing the beasts with his wits and even making a friend in one that he names Toothless. He soon realizes the reason for why the dragons are attacking and tries to convince dad that the winged creatures really aren't so bad afterall. Directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois have created a tremendous 3-D experience, setting the bar for animated 3-D much like ""Avatar"" set it for live-action. The dragon battles are thrilling and the flying scenes between Hiccup and Toothless soar with joy and pulse-pounding danger, and are magnified perfectly by John Powell's fantastic musical score. And at its heart this is a movie of friendship and learning to follow your own path, both movingly portrayed by Sanders and DeBlois' screenplay. The animation looks great, from the large, bushy-haired Vikings to the comically goofy looking dragons. The voice cast is also well-matched. Baruchel has a wheezy comic charm, Craig Ferguson gets the best lines as the village blacksmith, and who better to voice a Viking than Gerard Butler. ""Dragon"" is as heartfelt as it is impressive to look at, a family film perfect for all ages.",

The movie brings me so much joy just from watching a boy bond with dragon, the music is amazing and helps guide the watcher to understand how the scene is playing out. The animation is stunning, I think this is the first film where I truly started to appreciate how the reflections and textures of the dragons, clothings, environment, etc looked realistic but also still held that animation quality. Not to say that it's a bad thing but because of it I am looking for more films that do this and still make it seem like a fictional movie.",

114,19 November 2020,SebMoz,10, A true masterpiece,"DreamWorks has always been an unpredictable company even at their best. They unfortunately choose to make bad movies a little too often, movies that are either lazy, annoying or just full of dumb decisions. However, when they concentrate, when they pour their heart into a project, there is no limit to what they can accomplish. One of the best examples of this is, as you might have guessed, How to Train your Dragon. This is a marvelous demonstration of nearly all the qualities DreamWorks possess. The movie is extremely well paced and set up, and the plot is easy to follow yet intriguing at the same time. The animation is gorgeous and the character designs are amazing. The score is the best of any DreamWorks movie, maybe even the best of any animated movie. The characters are realistic and fairly well fleshed out, even though some side characters don't get a lot to do. The worldbuilding is great and the locations are well utilized, but the biggest strength of the movie is of course the dragons. They come in all variants, all of which are unique and have their own interesting concept and way of attacking. Toothless is of course the one given most attention, and he is in my opinion the single best animal sidekick in any animated movie. His relationship with Hiccup is wonderfully well realized. It's cute and heartwarming while also being the main drivingforce behind the plot. The final battle is super tense and is set up nicely, the ending is heartwarming and leaves a very good taste in your mouth. This is the textbook example of how to make an animated movie great, it's one of my favorite movies of all time and I will continue to think that for a very long time.",
115,8 August 2010,dutchs-1,10, Short and Sweet,"Everything in this charming morality tale has been done before. The hero learns to question his most deeply ingrained assumptions, overcomes opposition and changes everything. But it's visually spectacular, has some laugh out loud moments as well as some genuinely moving scenes, and a brisk pace that never bogs down. A medieval settlement is plagued by dragon attacks, but instead of being stock European serfs who flee from danger and wait for a knight to save them, these villagers are Vikings who fight back pretty much on equal terms. Interestingly, the elder Vikings have accents that sound more Scottish than Scandinavian, although I do confess I've never actually heard a real Viking talk. Hiccup, the embarrassing son of the rowdiest Viking of them all, befriends a dragon, learns the secrets of dragons and why they raid his village, and finally leads an attack that saves his father, the other Vikings, and the dragons themselves. One of the prize moments in the film comes when Hiccup's father sees his son riding a dragon to the rescue and soundlessly mouths ""what the ---?"" The aerial scenes are beautiful and thrilling. Great, great fun.",

One thing that bugs me is how dragons fly. Birds have hollow bones and that sort of thing but what of dragons? Their wings do not seem big enough to carry their own weight, much less that of a human rider. But a minor detail to be sure... Great movie. 3-D can help the graphics but even without it, I love it.

The special effects are sharp and vivid without overuse and do not get in the way of the visceral storyline, but make for a great backdrop. The story, itself is handled with care with a nice set-up and a more careful cultivation of boy and dragon and the fascinating learning curve obtained by this experience and how it is demonstrated in real practice is smartly addressed by the middle of the movie. Even the ending has a slightly educational and emotive element not usually scene in most action adventure movies. There is humanity and there are the requisite JURASSIC PARK (1993, 1997) moments with man confronting/anthropomorphic animal in the wild experience. In same ways, this movie resembles the basic human, emotional, you versus them conflict premise from THE INCREDIBLES (2004) that made that movie so powerful and compelling.",

I cannot compare the stories of the two but where the book has rather ugly pictures, the movie dazzles with amazing visuals. I think they would be great looking even if you didn't see the movie in 3d. It's not only the quality of the renders, it's the quality of the animation. I think it works best when the young viking Hiccup starts to interact with the fallen dragon. They are very lifelike and expressive even though the dragon does not talk. Later on, the flying sequences are not only spectacular but exhilarating. I had my doubts about the look of the main dragon (the one on the posters) but it managed to win my approval in both looks (a bit small though) but mostly personality wise. ",

Â¨ The creators of Lilo and Stitch, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, bring us this beautiful animated film called How to Train Your Dragon. I had a chance to see it in 3D and it was stunning! I am surprised at how fast animation is advancing these days because the visuals were as good as Avatar in my opinion. The scenes where the dragons are flying over the spectacular landscape are just amazing. This film is not just about the animation, it also has a great story and memorable characters. The movie is based on Cressida Cowell's novel while directors DeBlois and Sanders contributed by adapting the screenplay making this a fun film for the entire family to enjoy. How to Train Your Dragon has a lot of heart, which is strange for a DreamWorks film. This one might have a chance at beating Disney in the Oscars for the animated category next year. The music in this film is also great; John Powell has already worked in several other animated films such as Ice Age, Bolt, Happy Feet, and Kung Fu Panda so he has great experience in this area. How to Train Your Dragon has raised the bar for the next animated films to come out this year and it will be very hard to top it, and yes I know Toy Story 3 and Shrek 4 are also coming out this year, but they will have big shoes to fill.",

132,21 December 2010,jnguyen46117,9, How To Train Your Dragon: 9/10,"Based on a novel with the same name, writer William Davies was able to turn this kids story into a touching and deep first-class screenplay that is really rare for Dream Works. Hiccup, voiced by the devastating and believable Jay Baruchel, is a weak and low self-esteem little boy who lives in a world of Vikings. His dad and his friends, all around him, their life mission is to kill dragons and Hiccup is expected to do the same. Going through training and a lot of trying, Hiccup was not successful. Instead of killing dragons, Hiccup decided to read books on the dragons and found out they are not that bad. The belief was brought on after Hiccup met a dragon, who was considered the most dangerous dragon and did not try to eat him. This created a interesting but predictable twist for the audience to eat up on. Hiccup named his ""friend"" Toothless. Months go by as Hiccup trains his dragon friend Toothless to fly since he was injured when Hiccup found him. Throughout the training, their relationship begins to build and we see that Hiccup is falling in love. The writer really wanted us to cry at this point because Hiccup's friend Toothless was discovered by the town people and he's being killed by them. At the end, we know that dragons aren't as bad and Vikings shouldn't be killing them. This really looks like Disney's work because the message and the tone of the film is based on being friends and nice and all. At first, I thought this was not Dream Work's work, but after checking up on it, I was surprised. This looked more like Disney's cheesy work than Dream Work's. How To Train Your Dragon is classy, funny, kid-friendly, and intelligently scripted. It is one of the best films of the year. OscarBuzz: Best Animated Feature, this will go head to head against Toy Story 3. Even though Toy Story 3 definitely has a lead, if it didn't win, How To Train Your Dragon would snatch the Oscar.",
133,28 April 2010,Jonny_Numb,7, A Fireball Allegory with Heart,"Ah, jeez. Why did they have to make the dragons so darn CUTE under that scary, scaly, toothy exterior? So cute, in fact, that Toothless (a pitch-dark dragon called a Night Furie), the dragon our hapless (and unfortunately named) hero Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) befriends, reminded me of a cat I used to own (she was also pitch-dark, with a spot of white on her neck). Huh? Since when do dragons act like domesticated housecats when you get to know them? Ah, jeez. I suppose such questions are best left unpondered, since ""How to Train Your Dragon"" blends humor, pathos, and sometimes heart-melting tenderness with such grace and style that it had me shedding a tear or two by its conclusion. At its core, this is yet another allegory about not judging others by their differences, choosing your own path in life, and Doing The Right Thing (regardless of what others may think). The story is supported by colorful characters (dragon-killing vikings and their children), sharp writing that is by turns funny and truthful, and a fully fleshed-out world (including landscapes and a variety of colorful dragons that blend traits of both mammals and reptiles). The film is being marketed to capitalize on its 3D (which, admittedly, adds a few extra thrills to some scenes), but unlike ""Alice in Wonderland"" (so sorely lacking in pathos, style, and humor), ""Dragon"" is so strong on its own merits that the effect enhances the existing story, rather than becoming the sole reason for viewing.",

My revisit has rekindled my love for this movie. This is a wonderful film that fills me with joy each time I watch it.
Not only is this a great kids movie, it appeals to adults; it's a great story with amazing design and more heart than I ever would've thought possible. While the story might be a touch predictable after it gets going, the character development that comes along with the story brings a level of earnestness to the story I rarely see in animated films. The people and their relationships feel real, as do the consequences for their actions. As tensions get higher near the end of the film, the world expands, and the consequences more dire.
The final battle in this movie is probably one of the best dragon fight scenes ever brought to cinema, if not the best (What other dragon films even compare to this one? ""Reign of Fire""? Yeah, right...). The final fight, pitting the enormous dragon against Toothless and Hiccup is beautifully shot, absolutely stunning to watch, and epic in every sense of the word.",

So when i first saw How to Train Your Dragon back in 2011, i didn't find it necessary to say anything: anyone with eyes and ears would've understood everything without help from aside. Or so i thought. But after the excitement and praise the HTTYD's sequel received in 2014, with some even claiming that it surpassed its predecessor, it got obvious that eyes and ears are not enough: only with your mind and heart open you can feel the movie's ""soul"" if it has it, or notice its absence if it doesn't",

Directed by Dean Deblois and Chris Sanders (Lilo & Stitch) the film is set around a Viking village on the island of Berk that is periodically raided by dragons that steal from their flock of sheep. The film follows the adventures of Hiccup, a scrawny, awkward and socially outcast Viking boy who aspires to follow the tradition of his tribe in becoming a dragon-slayer, only to discover that he does not share his fellow Vikings' brutish nature.

I feel that, aside from Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and last year's Monsters vs Aliens, their films symbolize the worst of mainstream animation, focusing primarily on cringe-worthy pop-culture gags. What convinced me to buy a ticket for How to Train Your Dragon, then, was seeing that Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois â€“ directors of Lilo and Stitch (one of the few rays of light in Disney Animation's ""dark age"") - would be at the helm. Oh, and that 97% on Rotten Tomatoes may've been a part of it, too, admittedly.

The bonding sequences between Hiccup and Toothless are executed to perfection, and I love that they take their time. It takes a while, even in a montage, for these enemies to become friends. It makes their connection feel earned. Coupled with this is Hiccup's growth as a character as he not only becomes more confident, but becomes more thoughtful. Test Drive, in particular, is one of my favorite movie scenes, period. The accompanying track (also Test Drive) is among my favorites as well. John Powell has a lot of great music in this, like This Is Berk and Romantic Flight. The whole soundtrack is iconic. Watching his advancement in Dragon Training was really fun as well. Astrid and his dad come off as a little too harsh, but both of them have great character arcs and completely redeem themselves. The moral here about how hard it is to let go of what you think you know and see things in a new way is really important. It's also beautifully animated, with plenty of action and incredible flight sequences. The only downside is that the animation of the human characters doesn't really stand the test of time.",

The story itself was clever and original, about a young Viking lad named Hiccup who marches to a different drummer in that he's not your typical blood thirsty Viking but more an artist. Part of a young Viking's training is learning how to master the art of dragon slaying. Hiccup has an inside track on learning how to deal with dragons, and becomes what would be known today as a ""Dragon Whisperer"" (my term, not the movie). He knows how to make them do whatever he commands. However, slaying dragons is not in his ken, and the film's main plot centers around how to reconcile Hiccups pacifist tendencies with the ethos of the Viking Warrior.",

173,21 July 2010,Reel_starz,7," ""Dragon"" breathes a lot of smoke, but doesn't catch fire","For a decade now, Dreamworks has had to carry the uncomfortable burden of playing second fiddle to that animation behemoth, Pixar. If this was a family, Disney's Pixar would be the older, ambitious sister, the one always doted upon and destined for greatness, and Dreamworks would be her cruder but sometimes more entertaining brother. However, the rivalry between the two studios seems to be fodder for the media more than anything else. Instead of stewing in jealousy or attempting to outdo Pixar, Dreamworks opts to stay true to itself and to fashion its own path to success; in fact, the studio could act as the protagonist in one of its own movies. With movies like the Shrek franchise, Madagascar and Monsters vs. Aliens, Dreamworks tends to aim for entertainment rather than art, simplicity over depth and the funny bone over the brain. For the most part, their latest film, How to Train Your Dragon, stays faithful to this trend.",

178,11 April 2010,druid333-2,9," Suspension Of Disblief ,A Pre Requisite","As most school children know,the Vikings were originally from Scotland, and spoke fluent English,with a dense Scottish accent. That bit of beefing aside,'How To Train Your Dragon' is a fun time at the cinema. The plot:Hiccup is a young Viking lad who wants to hunt & kill a dragon, just like his brave Father,Stoick. Problem is that Hiccup is something of a screw up who just can't get things straight. One day when the village is being attacked by a horde of dragons,Hiccup manages to land one with a crude sling shot like device. When Hiccup goes to claim his prize (and try,one and for all to impress his dad),he finds out that dragons aren't as evil as they are made out to be. This causes Hiccup to do a radical re-think of dragons & study their movements. In the interim of all of this,Hiccup manages to form a bond of friendship with the dragon (which he even assigns a name:Toothless),all the while he is in training on how to kill a dragon with the other youngsters in the village (under Gobber's tutorial). It's now up to Hiccup to try & go on a one man (boy?)campaign to change the Viking's anti dragon bias. Dean DeBlois (Lilo & Stitch,Heima)& Chris Sanders (also Lilo & Stitch,both the feature film,as well as the television series)co direct,from a screenplay by DeBlois,from the best selling novel by Cressida Cowell. As this is an animated 3D-CGI feature film (released in both digital 3-D,standard 3-D,as well as flat 2-D formats),the voice talent include Jay Baruchel as Hiccup,Gerard Butler ('Rocknrolla','300',and most recently in 'The Bounty Hunter')as Hiccup's father,Stoick,Craig Ferguson ('The Late,Late Show With Craig Ferguson')as Stoick's best friend,Gobber,America Ferrera ('Ugly Betty') as Astrid,Hiccup's adversary,with Jonah Hill,T.J.Miller,Kristen Wiig, Kieron Elliot & Ashley Jensen.

185,27 March 2011,Jona1988,8, Manages to deliver in ways that will entertain viewers of all ages,"What I find so impressive with How to train your dragon is what I also stated in the title of this review, it has something for people of most ages. Also the stuff that will be enjoyed by the younger and the more grown up are not necessarily always the same things. I shall explain further what I mean by that. The story works great in that it is perfectly considered for the younger group. But I think the older part of the viewers will feel that the story just works well, not that it's bad or to thin in any way but just nothing special for them. What the more grown ups will find so brilliant is the humor. The humor is brilliant, specially the dialogue. The dialogue is so fun to listen to. But the reason is not really the jokes which I don't think have such a big part. The voices are brilliant and the dialogue is spoken in slack tone that make me laugh out loud just hearing it no matter what exactly is being said. The film also contains so parts of slapstick humor which all will find funny and it doesn't take a to big role either. Personally I found the humorous parts of much more entertainment than the story which filled it's part enough but not anything more. One other pleasure with this film is the animation, both technically and aesthetically. The humans look funny which is great but this is more a film about dragons and those also are the biggest viewing pleasure. Not only are they superbly designed but the way they move and specially the faces is massively impressive. The dragons behavior makes me think of cats and they definitively studied real animals for the animation. The dragons are both cute and fun to watch. There are some sentimental scenes in it to. What is impressive is that the emotional stuff more come from the visual rather than like more often story depth. The flying scenes are very impressive in the design and actually makes me think of Avatar, yes I think it's done on that level and I haven't seen dragon in 3D. Does the movie contain some moral message. Others have commented that it has, often I don't like when movies try to hide some message under a great production like some kind of propaganda. However even if someone maybe thinks this has some point to make it's nothing that I took any really note of so one can enjoy the film just as a piece of entertainment and that all which I am thankful for. How to train your dragon is a brilliantly entertaining piece. Perfect humor and effects, the part I enjoyed the most. Also it has a great story for the younger and works enough for the older to. When the film is over I feel like I could soon see it again and enjoy it just as much. I give How to train your dragon a 8/10. Great!",

The coolest dragon was of course Toothless. However, I could have chosen a better name for him. This is just a feel good movie about family, courage and fitting in. There were a few moments in the movie where tears welled in my eyes! I was surprised to see that Jonah Hill was doing one of the voices (I thought it was Jack Black at first).

A hapless son of the Viking chief begins an unlikely friendship with a dragon and realizes there's more to them. How To Train Your Dragon proves Pixar aren't the only ones who do great visuals, as it looks absolutely great. The story is deeper than one might expect and some of the flying sequences make you feel like you're flying with the dragons. It's a good visual experience and has a couple of good bits, but that's pretty much all I enjoyed. The main problem is that this doesn't tell me anything I haven't been told before.

I am a ""senior citizen"", who, of course, grew up with Disney animated movies. Loved animated movies then and still love them now - especially when they are as good as this. It first came to my attention in 2009 when I started reading blogs that jerry Butler was doing the voice over for this movie with the interesting title. I am a HUGE jerry butler fan, but despite that, I still missed it at the theater. Then I saw it on HBO and HAD to get the Blu-Ray DVD for our HD TV. Best thing I ever did. Movie is beautifully put together, all the way around - animation, script and character's voices. Great Cast - right down to the smallest character. Craig Fergeson was a surprise - I love him, too - and almost upstages Jerry Butler. But the best characters of the movie are Hiccup and Toothless, the dragon who is more a cross between a playful, lovable pet black panther and a stealth bomber than the scary villains dragons are supposed to be. The flying scenes are awesome and the interaction, understanding, tolerance and deep friendship that develops between Hiccup and Toothless (especially at the end) is the best part of the story. I have watched it at least 20-25 times, still enjoy it each time and still laugh at the one-liners. I actually have my favorites that I laugh out load at each time!

All-in-all, a magical movie for adults and children alikeâ€”a true family flick.

212,27 July 2011,jboothmillard,7, How to Train Your Dragon,"Released the same year as Toy Story 3 it was obvious this film would never win the Oscar against its biggest rival, I had to see if it was worthy however of the nomination, so I watched it. Basically, long ago,set in the time of the Vikings, on the Island of Berk, the townspeople are being continuously raided by large, flying and some fire-breathing dragons, young Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III (This Is the End's Jay Baruchel) wants to join the fight against them. But he is small and clumsy, he does however have an ability for inventiveness, village leader, and his macho father Stoick the Vast (300's Gerard Butler) however will not allow him to join. To prove himself to his father and the rest of the village that Hiccup can fight and does want to kill a dragon he ventures out and manages to hit the most sought after and most feared dragon of all, the mysterious unseen Night Fury dragon. He approaches the dragon trapped on the ground and tries to bring it within himself to kill it, so he lets it go, and he returns later to find the dragon still hanging around, looking for him. Hiccup names this dragon Toothless, fixes his tail, and he finds that he has an ability to communicate with him, and other dragons also. So when father Stoick is believing he is ready to start training to kill a dragon, obviously this comes in useful as he manages to fend off a dragon rather than hurt it, much to the annoyance of Astrid Hofferson (Ugly Betty's America Ferrera). Hiccup knows that many of the legends of the dragons are wrong, they are misunderstood creatures, they only raid the village for food to feed the much bigger source of their kingdom, they are actually a friendly species. For a while the villagers and those training to fight the dragons are fooled into thinking the young Viking is somehow able to scare dragons away, but seeing his dragon and finding out the truth is not very good. In the end however Hiccup proves himself against the biggest threat as he and Toothless fight against it, the villagers see that dragons are indeed not to be feared, and all live in harmony. Also starring Craig Ferguson as Gobber the Belch, Jonah Hill as Snotlout, Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Fishlegs, Kristen Wiig as Ruffnut, T. J. Miller as Tuffnut, Ashley Jensen as Phlegma the Fierce and David Tennant as Spitelout. The characters of young dragon-whisperer Hiccup, his quite feisty father Stoick, of course the friendly Toothless and many others really add to the mix, the story is pleasant and easy to follow, and the special effects do create exciting and terrific scenes, a most watchable family animated comedy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music, Original Score for John Powell, and Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, and Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film. Very good!",

One day during a dragon attack he tries to join in with a home made device. He claims to have hit a dreaded night-fury dragon but nobody believes himÂ… why would they; nobody has ever killed or even clearly seen a night-fury. The next day he goes out and finds the downed night-fury; he intended to kill it but when he can't as the dragon doesn't appear to be dangerous. He dubs the creature Toothless and gradually befriends it. When he attends dragon fighting school he uses the skills he has learnt dealing with Toothless to come top of the class. While showing Toothless to classmate Astrid they go on a flight that takes them to the dragons' nest where a huge dragon resides. When Hiccup's father learns this he takes Toothless captive and uses him to find the nestÂ… unfortunately he has bitten off more than he can chew and he will have to rely on Hiccup and his class to save the day using Hiccup's new dragon-friendly techniques.,

216,28 March 2010,d_art,9," Examiner Bio Movie Review: 'How to Train Your Dragon' sours, technically and artistically","The new Dreamworks 3-D (the type with 3-D glasses) animation, How to Train Your Dragon, takes place in a Viking village. Over centuries, man and dragons have been enemies. Dragons kill people, take livestock, and burn their villages, while men have been trained to slay them. Stoick (Gerard Butler) is the leader of the clan, a master dragon slayer, and the protector of the village. To his disappointment, his son, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), is the complete opposite of himâ€”timid, scrawny, and more brains than brawn. One day, using his engineering skills, Hiccup manages to capture a very rare type of dragon. Instead of slaying him, Hiccup lets him go and a secret friendship develops between them. Meanwhile, his Dad is also training him to be a dragon slayer.",

218,24 May 2018,andrewroy-04316,6," A light, straightforward movie with a strong third act","While the plot arc is nothing original and quite predictable, the setting is an uncommon one and there are great moments, mostly in the third act. Many of the plot details seemed forced and lacking in depth. For example, the ease with which Hiccup made dragons who have been trapped and spent years fighting humans just surrender seemed unrealistic. Minor points, like the lack of clarity with whether or not Hiccup needed to be there to help him fly, or how they got Toothless to guide them, were not well explained. The relationship with the girl was quite token and predictable. However, I did really like the theme of confirmation bias and assuming other groups are enemies. The soundtrack is very good, and the climax is fun, if (like many parts of the movie) people acquiesce in a way that's convenient to the plot despite being contrary to who they seemed to be before. All in all, it's a good, fun family movie, but to me it didn't live up to the hype.",

My theory is this......with Dreamworks animated films, the movie always has a spectacular first act, and usually has a pretty decent third act.......but the reason why the third act is always decent is because the second act always sucks. I kid you not, watch almost every Dreamworks animated movie and there is always.....ALWAYS a scene where our main character is walking alone by themselves kicking over rocks in an open field because they feel down about some stupid thing they did. Im sorry, but can we maybe switch it up a little? However, ""Kung Fu Panda"" did give me a glimmer of hope.......hopefully this movie can carry that torch.",

The last Dreamworks movie I had seen for a while was Madagascar 2, which wasn't that great. In my opinion, the best Dreamworks films are Kug Fu Panda, the first Madagascar, and maybe the second Shrek. Other than that, Dreamworks doesn't always score the way Pixar does. Their new movie, How to Train Your Dragon, while having an uncreative name, is incredibly well done in all aspects of an animated movie. ",
225,25 May 2015,anaconda-40658,7, How About a Komodo?,"How to Train Your Dragon (2010): Dir: Dean DeBlois, Chris Sanders / Voices: Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Furguson, America Ferrera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse: CGI film about facing fears. Set ages ago when dragons ruled the earth. Jay Baruchel voices Hiccup whose father is disappointed that he didn't become the famed dragon slayer he became. Central plot regards Hiccup's capture, release and friendship with a small dragon. Now it is up to Hiccup to prove to his father and others that they can live amongst dragons without fear. Superbly animated with detailed dragons of all sorts of shapes and sizes. Directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders are backed with a humorous script that only disappoints in its predicted ending. Baruchel brings great enthusiasm and humour to Hiccup's personality. We know that he will prove himself and his father will be proud and he will win the affections of the girl, but Baruchel is quite amusing. Gerard Butler voices his father, a champion Viking who has high hopes for his son but will see his son in a whole new light by conclusion. Other characters include Craig Furguson who voices a Viking with a peg leg and a hook. America Ferrera voices the tough female character whom Hiccup is interested in. She suspects him and will become the first to befriend him after a rough start. Other characters are flat and appear more as a great animation than a broad character with a background. Beautifully animated with a predictable yet entertaining story. It is pointless fun for children that will appeal to adults as well. Score: 7 Â½ / 10",
226,24 October 2010,sosvovenon,4, As a Swede I am mildly offended.,"If you were a Native American, wouldn't you get annoyed by a movie, in which the supposed ""Indians"" looked like Maori and spoke with a German accent? The ""vikings"" in this film are a disaster. Vikings DID NOT have horned helmets. If they spoke with an accent, it was NOT Scottish. The vikings in the film wear clothes and armor that is completely unlike anything a real viking would wear. I know this is a child movie-- but why not put at least a fragment of effort into making the ""vikings"" appear at least a little viking-y? This all becomes extra irritating when the supposed vikings make references to actual Norse gods like Odin and use the ancient Norse alphabet. (Ancient rune-stones with such writing can be found not far from where I live.) As the ""vikings"" in the film look and act like... well, nothing at all (except they have Scot accents), to be frank, why put these references to actual Norse culture in at all? This just makes it even more irritating. The people who made this film could have checked out ""Hrafninn flÃ½gur"" for instance to get a little bit into the viking feel... But apparently even checking vikings out on Wikipedia is too much of an effort... I wouldn't let my kids watch this movie, because I wouldn't want them to get the impression that our forebears looked and acted like dwarfs from World of Warcraft. Yeah, its a fantasy movie. But vikings actually existed... Another detail that annoyed me was the fact that the adults spoke with a Scot accent, and the kids spoke like Americans. The story is also stereotyped, a predictable ""from zero to hero"" story that even a young child could predict with unerring accuracy. The makers of this film have seriously underestimated children, I think. This movie is not a complete disaster-- it has its moments. But awesome animation and a charming character (yes, the black dragon) doesn't make for a movie anymore.",

229,11 April 2010,kgprophet,7, Gives you that Pixar feeling.,"The poorly titled animated adventure belies the simple boy meets dragon story as seen in trailers. This is a beautiful looking Viking epic, starting with an almost impossible opening sequence that juggles the introduction to all the characters, some jokes about viking life, all the while a huge dragon attack is taking place. As with any tentpole movie, effects or extravagant animated environments mean nothing if the story and characters aren't interesting. Here, our dragon trainer has a likable misfit nature that keeps the audience (both young and old) amused. That is one element usually missing in non-Pixar films. There are well formed characters throughout the ensemble, all of them showing personality and capable of generating good humour.",

231,28 February 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7, A tightly-constructed fable that focuses on delivering its message sometimes to the point of narrative detriment.,"There's a purity of vision in 'How To Train Your Dragon (2010)', one that sees it work incredibly well as a tightly-constructed, somewhat allegorical fable that has a strong central message. It focuses pretty much entirely on delivering this message, sometimes to the detriment of character and, even, story. All in all, it's kind of flat. Its world, and the people within it, are very two-dimensional and only change when the narrative needs them to. This, as I mentioned, serves its themes and, in a way, tightens its plot, but it does make things seem kind of surface-level. It's most noticeable with the father character; he feels like a caricature and, without spoiling anything, must be in contender for the 'worst dad of the year' award. Still, this overall dedication to theme makes for a focused experience that knows exactly what it's trying to achieve. For the most part, it achieves that. The 'all is lost' moment is very frustrating, which goes to show just how invested we are in our likeable protagonist's journey. This is helped by a fantastic soundtrack, which is probably the picture's greatest asset. The animation itself is decent but the actual rendering is slightly off. Most characters feel dead behind the eyes and, in some cases, it's kind of creepy; again, this is most notable with the father character. Still, the story is brought to life well enough and, during the flick's action set-pieces, the visuals often evoke a great sense of speed and spectacle while still conveying character, essentially, above all else. In fact, here character through action is often more successful than character through dialogue. The flick is entertaining, in general. It's not perfect, certainly, but it moves briskly enough that most of its issues come second to its integrity and overall fun. It's probably one of Dreamworks' better animated efforts, though it's certainly no 'Shrek (2001)'. 7/10",

My friends finally convinced me to go see it-- and I walked out of the theater that day with a whole new mindset. It. Was. Amazing. The music was the first thing I noticed. It has a sort of Celtic, old Norse vibe, which kept the movie lively and unique. And, the character of Hiccup (played by Jay Baruchel, whom I love), well, I fell in love with him from the beginning. He's like the basic humble, clumsy guy that ends up the hero, yeah all that normal stuff. But I was really...convinced by him; he was easy to relate to, for me. And he was pretty cute, too, in an animated sort of way. And I absolutely loved Hiccup's relationship with Toothless. That dragon reminded me of my cat, so it was adorable. Although there are some critics that say that this movie copied the plot of the well loved Disney classic ""Pocahontas"", I say, no way! There are some similarities, but the plot remains unique and different, while still managing to be very humorous and warmhearted. It's been a long time since I've liked and animated film, and this one is definitely the most beautifully done. I might even buy it (I usually don't). So, see it! I 1000% recommend it!",

269,10 March 2012,howard.schumann,9, Its message is worth remembering,"Of all the problems you want in your village, probably the last one would be having dragons destroying your crops and livestock. In How to Train Your Dragon, a wonderful animated film from the DreamWorks studio based on a novel by Cressida Cowell, these pesky creatures ignore the no-fly zone and create havoc in the Viking village of Berk. The film, however, is less about dragon wars than about having the courage to be yourself, even if it means challenging the conventional wisdom. In Berk, the tribal leader Stoick (Gerard Butler), a kind of hairy Hulk Hogan type, wants his slightly-built son Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) to follow in his well-trodden footsteps and become a dragon killer, the traditional activity of the Vikings for hundreds of years.

270,26 January 2019,TheMovieDiorama,8, How To Train You Dragon tames its mythical beasts through fiery action and emotional heft.,"I've been putting this off for years, and for the life of me I have no idea why. Dreamworks are often hit and miss for me, but this beautifully touching animation has enough heart to appeal to every family member and is definitely a hit. Hiccup is not like the rest of his Viking villagers, he refuses to kill dragons. He soon befriends the legendary ""Night Fury"", who he names Toothless, where he learns that dragons are not so ferocious after all. Packed with memorable characters, humorous dialogue and exhilarating flight sequences, it has everything one would expect from a family adventure. Plenty of development from the protagonist who sees his frightened self within Toothless. A prickly relationship with his father makes for some tension and relatable conflict, forcing Hiccup to be something he is not. Wonderfully paced with a surprising amount of laughs, particularly from the well casted voice actors (Butler especially!). Baruchel juxtaposes the primarily Scottish cast, and highlights his character's difference with the rest of the village. However, it is the tangible relationship between Hiccup and Toothless that makes this film work. Hiccup finds purpose with his newly tamed dragon, and there are so many moving scenes involving them that you can't help but become attached to them. An extensive five minute scene where the two learn to be in each other's company gave me goosebumps. No dialogue, just powerfully stunning visual storytelling that silenced me. The animation itself is often majestic, particularly with its environments and fast-paced action. Although some of the lighting was too dark, making certain scenes rather murky, but for the most part was watchable. I did have some issues with Astrid as a character though. An underdeveloped romance blooms between her and Hiccup and some of her dialogue was rushed and undercooked, particularly when motivating Hiccup to save Toothless. Small criticisms for what is an excellent animation that packs an almighty amount of fire and soars higher than Toothless himself.",

I was having breakfast and a little unwillingly I started watching it. After 10 min of the movie I knew it was going to be great. One can easily become fond of the characters and dragons. But that is where we come to the first problem: the dragons do not speak! Even though that gave a more realistic note to the movie, it would have been a little better (at some parts even hilariously funny) if they would have been able to talk. The dragons vary from extremely funny to gruesomely scary. The final battle was extremely well thought of, but the main antagonist did not have a lot of screen time and I thought that he was a little to big and dangerous for the way he was defeated. That battle should have been a little longer and with more effects. The relationship between the black, extremely cute dragon and Hiccup (the main character) was indeed beautiful and it shows (both young and old) that the things we do not understand, or that differ from us do not necessarily need to be hurt or killed. The message is clearly shown. The music has fitted wonderfully and it had a great viking-like theme. Voice acting was wonderful and the casting crew did a great job (especially with Gerard Butler). This movie is made primarily for kids, but even the older population will enjoy it. A great way to start your day.",

For me, there was a bit too much dialogue. The best parts were the montage moments between Hiccup and Toothless, which reminded me of that quiet simplicity in Wall-E.

The visuals are stunning and the storyline is an outstanding achievement. I'll only write a review if I enjoy a movie and this is no exception.
A village of vikings is continuously raided by dragons for their food and the towns runt (Hiccup) who isn't allowed to help fight them off (because of his small size) is determined to win his fame by killing the most feared (and never seen) dragon of them all. The night fury. After he uses a self made device Hiccup has his opportunity kill it and win the hearts of his village and the girl of his dreams (Astrid) but sees something deeper than the mindless monsters that he has been bought up to believe them to be.
After winning the night fury (toothless's) trust, a friendship blossoms but Hiccup needs to somehow convince his village and his father (Stoick the vast) that these creatures are stealing from them for a much, much more menacing reason.
My family and I love this movie. It has all the ingredients to make the perfect piece of entertainment for a great film. I especially love the touching scene where Hiccup actually manages to win Astrid's heart. When a saw this scene i know that this was going to be something truly special.

You will recognize a lot of A-list stars in this pic including Gerald Butler but this time it wasn't an distraction or had an ego and that's why most animation pics work because their is no ego involved just a vision and a story. At first to be honest I was hesitant thinking this might be just another overrated movie and didn't really win me over right away but once the dragon training and building relationships starts to unfold it wins your heart if you have one. After that it doesn't look back and becomes enchanting with amazing visual effects that actually made me say wow now that's amazing and beautiful and it was just breathtaking during the dragon flight scenes. I heard some critics comparing it to Avatar when it came to the flying scenes and I have to say that to me it surpasses it by a mile when it came to that and when it came to heart & soul, adventure, personality and the magical excitement, it made me feel like a kid again. This one will lift your spirit touch you to the brink of tears and thrill you with its eye popping 3D IMAX effects which to me still needs some work but this movie brings it in the right direction.

But i didn't go to the movie theater with any other expectation. God was i amazingly surprised! I couldn't even blink because i didn't want to miss any bit from the film. It was so amazing from start to finish (yeah, from start to finish). I saw it 3d so it was cool, but it is the kind of movie that you don't even realize you have glasses on because the movie carries you with it the whole time. Amazing animation, music, characters, plot and script (yeah i mean that); it was inventive (not the usual dragon stuff). Great directing, character development, funny from time to time and actually very sad in some parts. But there's a word to say it all... EPIC. God this movie didn't lack any sense of epicness, no matter which part of it. My heart was sunken and my eyes wide open the whole film. Yeah, i'll admit the relationship father/son has occurred many times and other things, but what is completely original nowadays in films? One more thing. This film is lovely and fascinating both for kids and adults (although kids might get scared once or twice ;D). It actually has a lot of message of friendship and to take care of animals and nature overall and it is presented in a way not only kids will actually want to take care of them. The flying scenes were superb, with john Powell's score and all (i cant get the score out of my head) and the whole movie overall. But my favorite parts were all when toothless was involved. I mean, when the movie ends, no matter if you are kid or adult, you want that amazing dragon as a pet. Tothless was amazing, and his development with Hiccup is so believable that you are jealous of that friendship. Its animation was amazing and he was so beautiful with his facial expressions and all. You know what? I'll just stop, because i fell i will never finish writing. This is a completely must-see movie and i want it to win the Oscar next year (yeah toy story, you have a superior now, and i dare to say so). How to train your dragon is equally my favorite dream works movie along with shrek (i'm beginning to doubt if i don't like HTTYD more, but shrek is a classic), and makes definitely my top five animated films of all time (well, without the 2d animation) along with finding Nero, shrek 1 and 2 and ratatouille.

320,10 September 2011,jdkraus,9," Good voice acting, Great Animation, and a Wonderful Score","""How To Train Your Dragon""? Really? Come on! You can sense my skepticism about this feature by simply mentioning its title. It sounds quite ridiculous, yet it fits perfectly. The story is simple. With a Viking setting, a boy who wants to be a warrior befriends an injured dragon and develops an unlikely friendship with it. The plot does not provide anything new, yet the animators do a swell job of making the audience fall in love with dragons. The combination of character's facial expressions and animation makes this feature among the best I have seen. The voice talent is exquisite, especially Jay Baruchel as the lead protagonist. What adds another flavor to this animated feature is John Powell's score. I knew it was not going to win at the Oscars, yet I was hoping it would. I have listened to all of the scores nominated at the 2011 Oscars and this was easily the best. Though a seemingly a simple tune, the music erupts into a fantastic orchestra, which takes the story to a whole new level; like what John Williams did for ""Star Wars"". When watching this on a DVD player, I just had to crank up the volume as I found myself conducting to the musical composition. Sorry for sounding absurd, but John Powell has created a gem that cannot be topped and it has truly touched the essence of my heart. ",

327,16 May 2011,rdukeesq,5, not good for hipster adults but this is a kids movie for kids,"So I saw ""How to train your dragon"", from 2010. So is it a good movie. Well the answer is no. O.K this movie is visually stunning, but with the evolotion of CGI, these incredible to look at movies are becoming common place. Also this is a kid's movie, and yeah if I was a small child I might think wow this is awesome, but I am not. There are movies which cross the divide between toddler and adult, for instance the original Shrek or even Shrek II (when the cops found a bag of catnip on puss'n'boots and he says ""thats not mine"" is just awesome). Hell, I even loved all three toy story movies. Granted you could say I have a problem with the kids all having American accents, but even if I accept this because it is a movie, why do the adult Vikings talk with Scottish accents. Shouldn't they sound more like the Swedish chef from the muppets, now that's funny. This story will probably play over well with average people and kids. However, if you are an adult, and don't have a dragon fetish, this is just the same old story about how we don't always know someone, until we get to know them, and a monster is not always a monster. Unless I was planning to do some hallucinogens while listening to pink floyd, while this was on in the background, it is just not worth seeing. If you have a family or are not into truly interesting cinema maybe this movie is your cup of tea.

This is very uncommon movie and it has set a milestone for 3D, not because of its technical aspects, but because of the Depth this movie has. This movie is as much for a 7 year old as it is for an old man who has seen a lot of life. This movie will entertain each viewer in his own way. This is a masterpiece!

If you see it carefully you will notice that there is more to it than meets the eye. Watch the movie and you will know what i mean.

With How to Train Your Dragon, I consider this a departure from that characteristic. How to Train Your Dragon took a more mature approach toward the story they're working with. As a kid, I wasn't a huge fan of this movie when it came out, but when I watched it recently, it became one of my top 3 favorite animated movies, and that's saying something for me. DreamWorks also made one of the gutsiest moves they could've made. I say this because they made it look like an animated Avatar, with the extravagant landscapes, and fantastic 3D animation. I also have to add these little details. First off, the directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders made Lilo and Stitch, and were also involved with the writing process of Mulan. Talk about a big step forward for these two. Secondly, for those of you who know cinematographers, the two hired the one and only Roger Deakins as a visual consultant for this film. With his repertoire of films, Deakins managed to get the vision that DeBlois and Sanders wanted to come alive on the big screen. What else can this movie offer?

360,25 April 2020,krational66,8, It's all because of you.,"The scene at the end of the movie really touched me. Hiccup struggles to get out of bed and heads for the door, supported by Toothless, which has never left the room. The director deliberately places Hiccup's legs and Toothless tail in the same shot. In just a few seconds, it tells the story of two individuals whose minds, lives or bodies are all broken, who meet each other and become a complete whole. Hiccup was originally an unacceptable loser. He was out of step with the group and could not get his father's approval. People regarded him as a problem. Toothless, as no one has ever seen it before, is a Toothless creature that comes and goes, destroying its opponents in an instant, but has never been known to man. When Toothless is bound and Hiccup's eyes are raised with a butcher's knife, a relationship of belonging, mutual trust, dependence, and ultimately strength begins. This is the kind of relationship that we wait for in real life but are always hard to find. Whether it is love or friendship, they are too vulnerable to too much desire and temptation in real life. With a theme like this, ""dragon"" doesn't need to be accompanied by the cruelty of reality like a pixar work. It just needs to create a dream that belongs to a child, but can make an adult feel happy and even moved at the same time, and then it will be successful.
There was no ice time in ""dragon"" at all, and the experience was like riding Disney's most exciting theme park roller coaster, SpaceMountain, for 90 minutes of absolute entertainment in 3D glasses. This time dreamworks boldly abandoned its own specialty of parody, the few small humor throughout the film just right, fully mobilize the atmosphere and lively narrative rhythm. Character design is even more endearing, especially as Toothless looks like a pet cat or dog, with every look and action so cute that viewers can't help but laugh or even put it down. The director, Dean DeBlois, was poached by dreamworks from Disney to direct the tepid Stitch in lilo & Stitch. Toothless has a lot in common with Stitch, not just its appearance and its teeth that contract, but its ferocious but honest insides. ""Dragon"" is another success in the film a lot of action, special effects the art and the progress of the 3 d technology, greatly increasing the appreciation of the film, the film driving dragon flight scene stimulation of romance, and 3 d technology compared to last year's ""ice age 3"" or ""up"" is definitely improved significantly. End is a topic of accurate convey, although it is a cliche communication and understanding, love and peace has not let a person feel tired, I feel very deep in the paragraph is when everyone knows the secrets of Hiccup is still determined to continue to play a game of unnecessary and war, Hiccup, as a small individual rolling between two camps, but powerless to stop to change anything.
But the dreamworks that is good at prankery is not the pixar that can tell a story all the time, although have big progress but because did not have the cover of prankery gimmick, flaw still exposed come out. The first is that the length of the film is limited due to the 3D and film types, and only 90 minutes is not enough to show such a completely empty legend. As a result, the film's opening is too hasty and the ending is handled too hastily. All the little conventions that are hard to swallow are concentrated at the end of the film, which is far from the previous part. It also influenced the production of supporting characters. Throughout the film, there were numerous types of flying dragons and various characters of Viking pirates, but ultimately there were no other characters I remembered and loved except Hiccup and Toothless. Back in the days of wall-e, there was MO, who didn't get many screen appearances but the audience couldn't get enough of him.
The dreamworks vs. pixar war has been going on for more than a decade, and the studio has been forced to make a case at the box office against an unbeatable competitor. Now that shrek's fourth installment has come to a dead end, and last year's monsters vs. aliens failed miserably, dreamworks desperately needs another kung fu panda to prove itself. ""How to train your dragon"" is a wonderfully humorous and engaging film, but it still takes real innovation to compete with its bigger rivals. Unfortunately, ""how to train your dragon"" looks like something new, but inside it is something old, as mentioned above, even the most eye-catching protagonist, Toothless, has already been made by a director, and this time it's just a repeat of itself. Aside from shrek: the fourth installment, which was already a desperate attempt to make money, dreamworks has only how to train your dragon to rival pixar's much-hyped toy story 3 this year.
""How to train your dragon"" is definitely recommended, at least for 90 minutes, it gave me a visual shock, a feeling of joy, and finally a little heart touch. For you and me, who are now under too much pressure, that's enough.",

With a great story and fantastic animation, characters which are easy to relate to and a good portion of humor, this is certainly one of the most rewarding animation movies I watched in recent years. Highly recommended, though not for small kids!",
364,27 March 2010,matthewtrask,9, As close to Pixar as Dreamworks will ever get!,"Up until Shrek Dreamworks wasn't making great animated films and then that green ogre came along and change that. Shrek was most definitely my favourite Dramworks film, that is until i saw this. The vibrant colours and the stunning animation really captivated me and the music made the experience even more gratifying. Yes there were a few flaws, as their are with any film but this is most definitely as close to ""Pixar Perfection"" as Dreamworks will ever get. If your a fan of very funny, action packed, sort of emotion then go and see this film, i am serious drop what ever your doing now and get down to the cinema! It might not be as heart warming as Toy Story or as tear jerking as UP but it will most certainly give Pixar a run for its money in the action department. A most satisfying whole and this years best animated film, until Toy Story 3 that is!",

370,16 April 2010,thefatgoaty,10, Dragons are so cool... Just like this movie,"How to train your Dragon is good for so many reasons: It's fun for kids, the 3D is superb, the animation was cartoony but full of detail, the story had a lot of nice meaning, dragons looked pretty ruthless, plot was pretty awesome and what most surprised me was the beautiful cinematography. This movie felt like a real action movie for kids. By the first scene I knew it was going to be good. It was like watching the D-Day scene in Saving Private Ryan except not as violent. There were fire balls and swords and smoke and people running and fighting. It felt like an action epic. This scene is were you learn about the characters and what different dragons there are and the different species were very well thought out so that they weren't stuck with the same old dragons that have been used since forever. The story is pretty good. Its about Hiccup, the son of a legendary Viking, however Hiccup has never lived up to his dad's expectations and feels like he needs to prove himself by killing a dragon. During a raid from the dragons, Hiccup takes one of his inventions out to try and kill the terrifying Night Fury, which has terrorized the village for ages and no one has ever killed it or seen what it looks. Hiccup takes aim and shoots the dragon down. No one believes that he has killed this dragon so he goes to find the body and bring back its heart for his dad. When he finds it its still alive but has been immobilized. Hiccup frees it and it runs off. When Hiccup goes back, he sees that the dragon has not been able to get out of this forest because its tail has been torn and it can not fly. Hiccup soon develops a friendship with the dragon and tries to teach it to fly again. And then the plot really picks up... I wont ruin anything but it does get awesome, despite the lame love interest. So I say go to this movie it is really great, although sometimes a little corny, but only a tiny bit, it is still a really great action/family/animated movie and I highly suggest seeing it in 3D.",

376,12 November 2018,Benslie,9, Great film for everybody,"First of all, the animation in this is spectacular. All the scenery in the film looks like something you could find in real life. The action, mainly the climax, and flying shots in this film also show how great the animation is. The main thing about the animation that is amazing is how the dragons look. They all look like real, kinda cartoonish, dragons that come across as vicious but also cute. The cinematography in this film is stunning. The lighting in each and every scene was chosen correctly for it. I really like the score in this film that was done by John Powell. The music in the film just helped bring you into this fantasy world of Vikings and dragons. Now my main problem is mainly the casting of the voice actors. They all did great jobs as their roles but I think some of them would have been better casted if their character was older and not a teenager. That can mainly be seen with Hiccup who is supposed to be a teenager but sounds like an adult who already went through puberty. I also had a few issues with the pacing in this film. Some scenes were way too short and I would have liked to have seen them a tiny bit longer. Now I do get that it's a film made for children but as long as there's moving objects on screen kids won't care what's happening in the movie. In the end How to Train Your Dragon is an excellent film for everybody no matter how old you are.",

It's not too much of a classic in my opinion, but it did have some unique moments that you may not see much in other animated films. This is certainly one of Dreamworks' best animated movies probably since Over the Hedge, as well as Kung Fu Panda. The movie's not Disney-like quality overall, but it does have about the same amount of heart, and without it, this movie probably wouldn't have done quite as well. The dragons in this film (especially Toothless) we're certainly well-created with nice personality and loving touches. Fun characters, very neat plot, and another good animated film by Dreamworks.",

Every time something new happens you will see how both characters and the environment react to it, (almost) all the characters and characters are slightly stereotypical kids adventure characters but totally designed in contrast to their visual appearance and the flight sequences are just the stuff to be made of dreams.

I don't have loads to say on but there was a lot to love from the characters, the story, the humour. It's what you'd expect from an animation. There certainly wasn't much to dislike from the film, it was just a good watch. It didn't leave me in awe of what I'd just watched, I just acknowledge that it's a good film.

I am sure that this movie can turn to a successful series.

401,27 April 2011,MoonHitler,10, Simply amazing.,"I shall start of by saying that this is my all-time favourite animated, and modern film, and my favourite overall (after The Matrix). If you go to this film expecting childish and simple, you'll be pleasantly surprised - although it originates from a short children's story, the film is incredibly far from this style. Suitable for all ages without being cringeworthy, and with a story that's closer to a humorous drama than a dramatic comedy, this film deviates from Dreamworks' usual style into something, in my personal opinion, much better; the visuals are breathtaking, the dragons are fantastic, the people are believable and the script is amazing. The most amazing part of the movie however, is the music; the tracks themselves are brilliant, and without their presence in the film, it would be lacking in so much emotion. Even more so amazing, is that the music amplifies the emotion in the film without being overly obvious - so much so that it took until the second watching before I realised that the 'forbidden friendship' scene was only as beautiful as it was because of the score. After I left the cinema, I felt so empty that I was drawn to see it again and again, something which no other film so far has done for me.",

The only things the film has in common with the book are names and dragons. As a huge fan of the HTTYD series, this film is a real disappointment. I like the books because they view dragons differently. You don't have dragons as the good guys in many stories, but Cressida Cowell makes them into companions of the Vikings. I feel this film completely ruins the point of the books. Because the stories are so different, if/when they come to make a sequel, they will have to make up a completely new storyline. The characters are all wrong which makes it impossible to sympathise with them. Astrid isn't even a character in the books! For any fans of the books, there is no way I would recommend this to them.

410,17 January 2011,mandydpr,10, Best kids (and not only) movie ever!,"I had been wanting to see ""How to train your dragon"" for a very long time, since i had heard from everyone what a great movie it is. I thought to myself OK a cartoon sure they are great how can this one stand out from the rest though. My expectations were exceeded!! The plot was fantastic, it had just the right amount of action, comedy, suspense, romance. And of course what a better way to say to people that appearances may be misleading than by figuring out that the so called ""bad guys"" the dragons are actually good. Toothless, the main dragon was amazing! It was a mixture between a cat and a dog and it managed to show how all living creatures have feelings! Sure one might say that we have seen all this before in other films but what makes this one stand out I believe is that it stays true in the concept it wants to exhibit which is the friendship and connection of all living creatures and how love prevails all evil and of course the very strong tool this movie had was that all side plots were limited to the perfect amount not to let the audience go astray from the main theme. Simply fantastic, touching and memorable. This movie is a call to everyone of ""how to train directors to make such great films like this one!""",
411,23 June 2019,blackwidowis7cool,10, Great start,"Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is the clumsy, misunderstood son of the Viking chief, Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler). He comes across an injured Night Fury, the most feared dragon of all, and finds that he can't kill it. He sets out to nurse it back to health and train it in secret, but then he is thrown into Dragon Training by his father while his father then sets off to find the Hidden Nest of the dragons and kill them all off. Suspicions mount about Hiccup and the Night Fury (whom Hiccup calls Toothless) might be so safe after all. Can Hiccup protect him and the rest of the dragons?
I apologise for the bad plot description.
(It's much better than how it sounds).
This is a great start to the trilogy. Butler and Baruchel do great jobs in their respective roles as father and son. Stoick is a very relatable single father who is trying to do a good job in raising his son.
Great character development and plenty of humour.
The CGI is good, but it definitely improves in the other films. Toothless is adorable and I like how they make the dragons have characteristics of pets such as cats, dogs, chickens, etc.
Thoroughly entertaining, though not one for everybody. Recommended.",

Man, was I wrong. First off the whole character development actually made me watch the movie without looking how many minutes are left of the movie. I just watched it the whole way through and before I knew it I liked something. The 3-d animation was cartoony, but at some places I was at awe at some of the 3-d textures they put into this movie. The overall in general concept was very clichÃ© but how the concept was portrayed and the act in which they specifically tackled it, made it fresh and unique. If you are slightly or even considering watching this movie. I would say go ahead and watch it. The only way I can see how someone wouldn't like this is if they aren't into these movies or they have a grudge of some kind towards the making of it. Enjoy. 8/10",

The main character wants a girlfriend and is sad that he'll probably never get to go on a date ... wait, what? For that matter, why do ANY of the Vikings have a Scottish accent? o_O And did *any* female Vikings *ever* leave their homes and hearths, or whatever? Also, how come the dragon knew so many human gestures when he'd barely spent any time around the main character, or any other human? He's gesturing with his head at the fish, indicating that the boy must eat it, and mimicking the act of swallowing.

And the animation is as adept at shooting glowing worlds of surprise - a flight via voluptuous clouds, as inviting as overstuffed pillows, is entirely magical - as it's miles at tiny, telling information. In a flashback that shows Hiccup as a motherless child comforted by means of a father half of-damaged through his personal sadness, the boy has a little scratch on his face. It's this kind of minor element of a richly realised bigger image, and but I observed it oddly poignant - an indication that adolescence, inspite of a fearsome Viking warrior for a dad, will inevitably contain pain.",

When I first saw this movie, I thought, hey! cool! dragons and stuff! not too big of a deal, right?
But this movie goes deep for a ""kids movie.""
The story is deep and is perfect. The scenes, especially the first time Hiccup flies on Toothless, are stunning, and with the score, it becomes a masterpiece.
This movie clearly deserves a 10/10",

Almost every aspect of this film, from music to visuals to characters are phenomenal.",
422,1 December 2018,sigpret,1, Don't you see the irony?,"The message of the film is great: even the seemingly evil dragons are actually not evil but just like you - they have also feelings like you, need also food like you, and so on. This is a great message for a family movie and I enjoyed the first half of the movie a lot. But the end ruined it all and this is why.
In the end, the maker of the movie simply created a bigger dragon which is told to be the actual reason for all the problems described before and this big dragon is truly just evil. And this is such a stupid thing to do because it implies that there are just evil beings that must be killed. But the message of the film was actually supposed to be the opposite! That were actually the beliefs of the vikings that the boy prooved to be wrong! And in fact the message of the movie applies to the bigger dragon, too: the bigger dragon simply needs food and this is why it eats the other animals. We are doing the same. But the vikings and dragons start attacking the big dragon, hit it in the eye which hurts it a lot (so the bigger dragon has feeling just like is, too), burning it with flames and eventually killing it. After that horrible scene it gets even worse: once the bigger dragon has died, there is peace and harmony. This is such a terrible message for a family movie and, again, it totally contradicts the message the movie is supposed to have, because in the end all this movie is telling you is: find the evil, kill it and everything will be great. The analogy to human thinking and the reason for wars is obvious and in this sense the movie supports the idea that a war is a good thing since it destroyes the evil. So this movie pretends to have a lovely message and I have neither understanding why the makers included this big irony nor why so few people see this obvious contradiction. To me it was just painful to watch how the boy shows that the seemingly evil dragons are just like us and later they all attack the bug dragon, hurt it a lot and eventually kill it. This is a terrible movie and I give it only one star.",

426,16 November 2012,wkornely,10," Better than Shrek, a must see!","The idea of taking my crazy younger cousins to see an animated dragon movie didn't intrigue me too much. I imagined myself sitting in my seat bored to death, hoping the end could come quicker so I could go be with my friends. Boy was I wrong! I could have stayed after the movie was over for multiple re runs, I loved it so much. It is safe to say that during the car ride home and for several days after I was the loudest and most excited critic of the bunch. Directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders did an incredible job of creating an amazing film that follows a typical storyline of a misfit boy that wants to impress his strong willed dad. In the typical storyline the father and son get into some fights, make up and then in the end everyone is happy. Instead of being like all the other films, this film is different because it incorporates incredible animation that interests its whole audience instead of just the younger kids in the theater. How to Train Your Dragon came into theaters March of 2010. In November 2012 I had to go to three different video stores to find a copy of this movie to watch because they were all rented out. Sanders and DeBlois made a masterpiece of a movie, by forming a perfect cast of actors and creating amazing animation for an audience of all ages, even stubborn sixteen year olds. This is a definite blockbuster holiday get together hit! The main character, Hiccup, is played by Jay Baruchel. Hiccup is the misfit, skinny, awkward young boy that can't seem to do anything right to make his father proud until the end of the movie when Hiccup finally proves to his father the way dragons really are. Baruchel was the perfect actor to voice Hiccup because he himself is known for his lankiness and awkward yet endearing characteristics. I went through the list of actors after watching the movie and did research to realize each actor's character virtually represented them in the movie. Not only with their personality but looks as well. Having this representation on screen makes a huge difference for the audience because the voice and appearance of the character look natural. It is also a benefit for the actors themselves because it really makes it easier for them to get into character.",

Right from the start as the narrator describes his world, you are immediately there. You feel yourself in the characters place. The movie does that for you.

The end of the animation was something I did not expected, something normally you won't see in animated movie. And John Powell did excellent work making music for this movie.

Look, if they wanted to make no effort to get the accent sounding somewhat right, then just make all of them have a N. American accent. But Scottish just makes no sense at all!!! They had Denmark, Sweden or Norway to choose from but they didn't bother? Or was it just that any old accent from Europe would do? Lazy!!",

443,27 November 2010,mysteryfan04,8, Wildly Cluttered But Saved by Visuals,"How to Train Your Dragon is a fun but somewhat empty animated film. The film's premise is very inventive: a Viking's son who is reluctant to kill dragons befriends one and tames it as his own. The Viking's son is our narrator for the film. He is a plucky, very clumsy boy; one clichÃ© to start with. When he discovers the dragon he thought he killed in a field alive, he panics but eventually decides to train it. The movie is filled with visual splendor. The flight scenes of the protagonist riding the dragon Hiccup are so beautiful, brilliant, and amazing. However, the story itself is very thin. This film is a perfect example of style and visuals over substance; kind of like an animated version of Avatar. The first half of the film is wildly uneven and cluttered that you wonder how the screenplay wasn't edited. The second half is a vast improvement, especially with its epic climax and last emotional five minutes. As a whole, How to Train Your Dragon is more of a entertaining diversion than something totally memorable.",

445,9 March 2022,marcobrcc,6, The same old story,"The story presented to us here is very simple and seen many times already in countless other movies. The plot follows a rather straight line without excessive complications, everything is quite predictable from the beginning. There are no major flaws, but the unpretentiousness of the plot and the simplicity of the characters makes the viewing tedious for adults. That's exactly why the ""coming-of-age"" of the village thanks to a young, underestimated protagonist feels a little too fast and sudden. The clash between the two factions is solved a bit too easily with the introduction of a third enemy, bigger and scarier, but unlikely. Without going into the details (the relationship between the dragons and the giant dragon is never explained), the death of the giant dragon is too easy, considering how frightening it was for the other creatures. The relationship between the protagonist and the father and the one between the protagonist and the blonde girl could benefit from a more detailed and credible development. The finish is perfect to make a very young audience happy, but objectively it feels too simple and forced. As for the animation, nothing exceptional, but nice enough to look at. There is no doubt that all this simplicity, which reduces the pleasure for adults, makes this film very suitable and enjoyable for children.",

I'd first off like to say that 99% percent of the time I would pick a Disney/pixar Movie over a Dreamworks flick. This is not the case this movie is a great film, I've seen so many films over the last few years that pride themselves on the fact that there visually stunning. What makes this one so different you might ask yourself. It's the fact that it doesn't pride itself on that. Of course It's a good looking film (hense the 3D effect) but it's the story that really kept me going for 90 or so odd minutes of the picture. I saw this movie with my girlfriend (15) my mom (56) and my nephew(8) and we all loved this movie. I think that this easily is the best Dreamworks movie since the original Shrek. It also has humour and great chemistry between these characters. If your looking to see a good movie this weekend or on cheap night go out and see this and I can assure you that you won't be disappointed I was hesitating at first but now I'm glad I did not wait until DVD release or Illegal download for this flick.

455,16 April 2010,myn6267,9," Simply the best animation of the year, a very intelligent way of expressing friendship and love","Honestly, i wasn't interested with the movie at first. I know it is kind of a grand animation of the year but it just didn't attract me after all. It was an irregular Saturday where my cousin came to my hometown and spent his weekends with my family. My responsibility was to entertain him, it didn't sound that necessary, though. So we went to the nearby cinema and looked for a reasonable show instead of a 'popcorn' movie. We chose HTTYD because it appeared to most watchable among the others like Steven Carell's date night(preferable in dvds) and clash of the titans( me alone had watched it, don't wish to watch it second time since the movie has loosing plot). I walked into the cinema with low expectation as i was worried it might turn up to be some c+ level animation like planet 51. I have to say, this movie drills me from the beginning to the end. The plot is simple and the story is seemly predictable but it relished me with its stronghold bonding between the dragon-Toothless and Hiccup. There's one remarkable scene in the movie which vividly caught my like, the scene when Hiccup decided not to kill Toothless and freed him. It was a crucial moment where Hiccup could just execute the dragon and obtain desirable fame but he formed strong friendship and partnership with Toothless instead as both have solid conscience to understand what's best for them. Stoick effortly expressed his fatherly love to his son which touches me a few and how Astrid bumped to Hiccups entertained me hilariously. The graphic is as usual- great and it is more outstanding in 3d(although i didn't watch it in 3d, i heard the appraisal from my friend). I have always entrusted Dreamworks since their fame debut- shrek and Madagascar. A really great movie by itself, adults will like it and children will love it.",
456,6 June 2010,rothx16,5, Don't bother,"What an average movie. I'm not sure why I went to see it except it was one of the more-highly rated movies at the local 2nd-run theatre and I was bored. During the 1st 5 minutes, I became pretty certain I wasn't going to like the thing; I couldn't understand the dialog because of the high level of background noise: sound, explosions, mayhem, characters yelling. Who can tell what they're saying? Even during the opening scene when we're somehow flying toward the village at night, I couldn't tell what the narrator is saying. Have we seen this formulaic tripe before? Yes: Misunderstood motherless nerdy boy who has the capability to change the world, if only his father and others would listen. Did any one see Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs? Same story. The second thing was the accents of the characters: Scots were Vikings! Who knew?? Yet their children speak like modern day Americans and act like them too: cliquish, bullying brats. People are the same, century after century. The dragon, Toothless, looks nothing like a killer-turned-pet by the boy's kindness. No, he's one of the stupidest-looking characters ever; more like giant tadpole. How did he lose 50% of his tail wing? Doesn't matter; without that, there's no story. And who knew: dragons eat fish! They must be part pelican. Something else we didn't know! What an education.... I'm still trying to figure out if the dragon was telepathic or what; how else did he know where the boy wanted him to fly? How did the strategy of how to avoid the big Momma dragon (we are never really told what the big and only MEAN dragon was, except that dragons are like bees and ants: they have a queen. Wow! Lizards have Queen lizards! Another revelation! Take notes, kids!!) Yep; turns out all the man-killers are really kind-at-heart, misunderstood, over-large pets. All we ever really needed to do was walk up and pet them. Again: who knew? If only we were as wise as our children! is once again the moral. Parents are left apologizing and in awe of the kids. So much for Confucius. Finally, we learn that it's really OK after all to kill a dragon as long as it's ugly and as big as an entire city. Makes sense to me...",

Visually the movie is very appealing with all the effects and flawless animation can be seen throughout. The characters are appealing as I said the concept itself is quite good. The direction is perfectly worth appreciating. The protagonists character ie Hiccup is carved out so magnificently. One more thing to add is that the movie stirs you up emotionally as well. The bond of Hiccup and the dragon toothless is elegantly portrayed. The movie is predictable and that's the only minus point.

Unfortunately, impressionable children will be viewing this movie and internalizing this dangerously naive message. Some would say that the world would be a better place if we would all just stop fighting and show understanding for one another. Yes, it would. However, I'm pretty sure that terrorists and tyrants aren't going to be as cooperative as the fictional characters in this movie. My grandchildren enjoyed the movie, but I'm very sorry I took them to see it.",

476,29 March 2010,lakelyn,10, Anyone can enjoy this.,"This movie is nothing you haven't seen before, but everything you want to see in a movie. You can't help but feel a compassion for each of the characters that, bolstered by the animation, causes you to laugh, cry, and gasp aloud. Here we have the typical coming of age story with father-son disagreements, special animal-man relationships, pacifist sentiments, and predictable romance-- such themes are no strangers to film. But this story in particular is stocked with pithy, intelligent dialogue and easy humor without seeming to relish in its own accomplishment. The movie packs in a lot of information in its too-short hour and a half. I wouldn't have minded if that time was doubled. Many others are comparing How to Train Your Dragon to Avatar. While there are obvious similarities, I must say that I found the characters in HTTYD considerably more compelling; I never came close to crying in Avatar. I also did not expect the slight twist in the ending here. I won't give it away, but it was a refreshing change from the stereotyped finales that everyone predicts before the movie begins (again, I'm looking at Avatar). Overall, How to Train Your Dragon is fun enough for children and intelligent enough for adults. This college student certainly enjoyed it, and was utterly consumed. I experienced a slight shock when I looked to the side and saw my familiar, non-dragon friends still sitting beside me. Anyone can (and most will) enjoy this.",

How could you make Toy Story with people? Put a cowboy hat on Tom Hanks and put wings and a helmet on Tim Allen? I don't think so.

480,17 August 2014,harshagr,10, A must watch for all !,"There is nothing you can not find in this movie, a perfect mix of comedy and adventure, has some of the best action sequences and then it also has its sad and touching moments to keep you moving. Spectacular visuals and story line make every moment a treat to watch, making it an epic. The story is set in the land of Vikings, who are rough, fearless and strong people, and kill dragons (really ?) to save their city. Then there is a Viking boy, Hiccup, who does not kill a dragon he captures and later becomes friend with it, whom he names as Toothless. Apart from them, there are many characters, playing very important roles in the movie. The movie contains brilliant graphics and astonishing visuals but the main power lies in its plot. The impressive characters and the storyline is the heart of the movie. Though it does not give much time to the characters to grow up in our heart, but that's justified for the pace of the movie and the huge variety of things it provides. There are happy moments, there are sad moments but I can guarantee that there is not a single dull moment in the whole film. ",

And if you've seen it, the next surprise is that it manages to take elements which could have made this movie clichÃ©d and disappointing and do them right. This movie has excellent execution and pacing. Its characters are all likable and memorable. Its nonhuman main, Toothless ranks up there with the best silent animal leads in film. The CGI is absolutely breathtaking and the music even more so. The only complaint I can think of is that the reveal near the end doesn't make total sense. But in the whole, this is an excellent film for all ages. Dreamwork's has arguably been in a slump since its early Shrek days. With this, they show they can contend with Pixar in storytelling.",

From start to finish how to train your dragon shows how tradition changes and the world is ever changing, there are many messages that can be drawn out of the movie such as an environmental statement, one with animals or in the case of the movie- one with dragons. You could praise this movie so much, but what stands out for me is the constant WOW moments i experienced whilst watching this movie, the visuals and the angles just made me feel as if i was riding the dragon or fighting off the dragons, i felt immersed in the world the animators had created, and that is a very large accomplishment. Even though the plot line has been used a million times before the pacing and twist on the plot supplied to us by the directors makes How to Train your Dragon all the more enjoyable.

Jay Baruchel was easily recognizable in Hiccup, (great work - animators!) naturally likable character in his honesty in admitting his imperfections that later turned to be to his advantage. All characters were distinct and engaging, I could recognize modern teenagers in them. Moreover, the film carries many positive messages that our society needs. Being intelligent is better than being a fighter, parents sometimes can be wrong, try to find peaceful solution to the conflict. The story won't let anyone predict what is going to happen.

509,3 July 2016,bscrivener-50810,8," Charming, sweet and an all-round entertaining adventure for everyone to enjoy!","Released at a time when many of DreamWorks Animation films were either receiving negative or mixed responses from critics and audiences alike. How To Train Your Dragon finally brought the studio back into the spotlight and returned them back to form, with their greatest hit in years and to the opinions of some as their greatest film ever (this is disputed with Shrek 2.) How To Train Your Dragon, is set during an fictional Viking setting, in a land plagued by dragons and the Viking's desire to finally wipe them out once and for all. Here we are introduced to Hiccup, a shy, awkward and weak son of a great viking warrior, struggling to find his place in this world with men fighting for survival. After an attack on the village, Hiccup injures a dragon and begins to track it only to find himself bonding and connecting with the dragon on an emotional level, completely outside the realms and depths any Viking had gone before. How To Train Your Dragon is beautifully animated, with the animation being smooth and crisp and having a unique style for itself. The characters are likable, relatable and their motivations and actions clear (while some may seem a little stereotypical.) The emotional scenes between Hiccup and Toothless the dragon are charming and sweet and the two serve as the story's unlikely companionship, especially the flying sequences which may be some of the greatest looking and heartfelt moments in an animation film ever. The film flows well with the distinct first, second and third act and never looses steam, neither containing unnecessary scenes or wasted screen time. Despite a few exposition and an unfortunate flaw in the accents of the characters, the film is close to perfect- while it may be nit-picking, the mix of Scottish and American accents just don't seem to fit the setting very well and can come off as a bit annoying. As a summary, How To Train Your Dragon is gorgeously animated, charming and sweet to the core and has a very well developed plot as well as being a great return to form for DreamWorks Animation. 8/10",

When you set your mind to it, you can create good animation films, despite being under the gigantic shadow of Pixar most of the time. How to Train Your Dragon is an excellent and enjoyable film with Vikings and Dragons, mixed with good, pure humour, thrilling, jaw-dropping actions scenes and chases â€“ on dragons, of course. Jay Baruchel voices Hiccup, a Viking who is so not a Viking. He's that puny, stick figure in comparison to his disappointed and huge, buff dad, Stoick (voiced by Gerard Butler) who also happens to be the village's chief. Hiccup can't kill dragons to save his life. But what he does instead is accidentally catch the most powerful and deadly dragon in history, a Night Fury, and befriends it. He feeds him fish (no eel), makes a harness and trains him to fly while riding on his back.",

No surprise, given that co-director Chris Sanders has had a hand in every good Disney film starting with Aladdin until he left the mouse house in 2006 (and I suspect John Lasseter now regrets letting him go).

During pre-production, Deblois and Sanders took over writing the plot from Bonnie Arnold (producer) and decided to steer it away from working too closely to the book. They said they did not want to make it too childish and ""whimsical"". Instead they made slight changes, making the film appeal to a wider audience.",
527,25 July 2019,jessbir-23618,8, Breathtakingly beautiful,The how to train your dragon franchise is amazing but the first one is and will always be the best one I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and being totally blown away by the emotional depth and beauty of it the friendship between hiccup and toothless might be the most beautiful Friendship ever brought to screen and the father and son relationship in the film is extremely well done and emotional there are so many scenes in this movie that can make you shed a tear one of them being the romantic flight scene witch in my opinion is one of the most magical enchanting scenes in movie history. the characters are all fantastic and memorable and the voice acting Is great. the animation is Breathtakingly beautiful and so is the rest of the film. the score is absolutely incredible.

531,21 June 2017,brightbrumby,10, One of the best movies I have ever seen,"I don't have the words. If you hate this movie, then I'm sorry, you have no heart. This movie tells the tale of a forbidden friendship between a teenage Viking and an extremely rare dragon whom no-one has ever killed. Berk is a land of kill or be killed, and Hiccup, a weak Viking boy and the clumsy son of the chief, wants to kill dragons like everyone else. But when he shoots down an ultra-rare Night Fury dragon, whom no-one knows anything about, its soul reflected his own. After befriending the dragon secretly and learning about the ways of dragons, he learns that everything Vikings ever assumed about them is wrong. Not only does it warm the heart, it is eye-opening with magnificent animation and blows you away with an amazing soundtrack. Every adult in the cinema did not even blink while watching this movie and there was even applause in the end. It deserves applause from families everywhere. A friendship between a weak young boy and a deadly dragon show the viewers about unlikely friendships being beautiful and peace becoming possible. The end also shows that peace can sometimes comes from the most unlikely of sources. In my opinion, this movie turned out perfect and I could not imagine it any other way. How To Train Your Dragon will amaze you, tug at the heartstrings and open your mind to things you've never seen!",

I am not one who is really committed to animated films, but this is fantastic. I actually cried, and I RARELY cry in movies. Both original and yet familiar in its story, nothing has made me want to grow a beard more. Ever since Hagrid, I have wanted to own a pet dragon, but this movie has made me determined to find one. Seeing it in 3D is a must, the flying scenes rival those of Pandora, and from me this is something because Avatar is like my life. Also, buying the soundtrack is highly recommended.

538,13 April 2010,gauravchauhan,8, Asterix and the Gauls turn Dragon hunters,"Its no Kung-fu Panda, but How to Train Your Dragon does what it sets out to do and some more. The brief intro to the Vikings is reminiscent of my favourite Gaulish village and did bring out a grin. The main character is Hiccup a misfit viking, who is also (unfortunately for him) the Chief's son. Born with a significant lack of brawn as far as his peers go; the young man pursues his goal of slaying a dragon with a single minded dedication which mostly lands him in several interesting situations. The boy finally does bag a fabled dragon but can't seem to find it in his heart to kill the beautiful creature so he ends up freeing him. Thus begins the symbiotic relation ship between the man and beast as they find common grounds and ultimately become friends. The story is fairly predictable from here on however Sanders and DeBlios handle it extremely well and about a half hour into the movie have you eating out of their hands. The visuals are great especially the flying sequences which are brilliantly shot and they end up conveying the energy and adrenalin rush to the viewer. The big baddie dragon is the perfect villain though this angle could have been delved into a tad more. Regardless of this the movie is one of the best animation movies to come out in a few years and is definitely worth a watch with the family. No matter how old you are you will want your own dragon by the end of it.",
539,1 August 2016,MovieloverIreland,9, Best Dragon film ever,"One of the most joyous animated films i have ever seen with a goose bump inducing soundtrack from John Powell that elevates the film to classic status. With a hopeful message of getting to know and understand your enemy to discover they may not be as monstrous as you suspect this is a wonderful story. Upon first viewing this i was reluctant to watch due to Dragon movies generally being poor and this being a ""kids"" film, I was also put off by the unusual design of the Dragon's which looked silly to my eye but the story got me hooked especially when Hiccup voiced wonderfully by Jay Baruchel finds the wounded Toothless. These scenes of initial fear that gradually turn to mutual trust and bonding are wonderful and the heart of the film. I was worried the plot was going to have Astrid America Ferrera report Hiccup to his father Stoick Gerard Butler but instead Astrid joins Hiccup in his adventure and the film is all the better for it. We never get bogged down in forced romances. The real romance is a bromance between Hiccup and Toothless. The soaring flying scenes with John Powell's driving score raise hairs on back of neck particularly in the training flight and more beautifully in the romantic flight with Astrid. Every film needs a villain and this is perhaps HTTYD's weakest point. The final battle is visually spectacular as Hiccup proves himself to his father and takes on a giant Dragon losing a limb in the process but i think it felt just a little rushed and needed further set up but this is just nitpicking.",

I cannot find a flaw in the movie. The effects are spectacular, the dialogues are very well-written, the cinematography is spectacular. I am sure that if this movie had been 2 1/2 hours instead of 1 1/2, we would still enjoy it and wouldn't feel the time pass.

I got the pleasure to see this movie in a very extra special day for me, and I really did not found interest, thought it was a little kids movie. I was very very wrong. This film had great 3D effects, that no other animated movie can create. The plot is about Hickup, a boy who wants to fit in an slay a dragon. However as the story goes on he gets to realize that they are not as bad as people think think. First of all his character is hilarious. Next, Toothless, the main dragon of the film is very adorable. Not only was he named incorrectly, but you get to make a bond with him. The other characters I really had no interest for since they were really not the people I would want to have around me. The movie has a very strong message about don't judge someone by their appearance. That message really won over me. This movie is awesome and it was one of the best animated.

However, 3D films are terrible if they don#t have a great storyline behind them because then they just turn out like 2012, loads of effects and not a lot else, aka Rubbish. Luckily HTTYD has a great story line, the traditional unpopular protagonist who overcomes something or other by alternative methods and saves the day, with plentiful lashings of viking-esquire styling to boot. The plot is good fun and quirky with a good ending and the flying scenes appeal to myself greatly, although that might be due to the fact that dream about such things. The 3D aspect of the films is a little under par in my opinion but not to the point that it is bad, it is just I have scene 3D done better. There are a couple of surprise actors, namely Gerard Butler (300), which where a welcome surprise and gave that film a familiar dimension which helped in some way or another.

And it's innocent, just the way a cartoon should be. You can watch this with your kids without feeling concerned with the innuendos typically thrown into most movies these days, and still fully enjoy it yourself. Good moral, great characters, awesome plot, phenomenal music. I've always liked the idea of dragons and other mythological creatures and this film amplifies that. Basically it's about a teen whose eccentric and open-minded personality doesn't jive with his dragon-killing, brawn-over-brains Viking peers. Desperate to fit in, he becomes determined to do what no Viking has ever done and kill an extremely dangerous Night Fury Dragon. One night he actually succeeds to injure the infamous creature only to discover that dragons aren't at all what he's been led to believe....and it just gets better from there.

579,3 April 2010,blessybritanico,5, Reasons why I don't suggest this movie,"Before entering the movie theater I had no idea of whom the cast of How to Train your Dragon would be so I was playing Russian Roulette with it. After watching it I realized that I fell asleep halfway through the movie due to the lack of excitement and knowing I had spent about 80 dollars for 4 people wasn't to pleasing on the ride back home. I thought I would enjoy a nice 3d flick with my family, but instead I saw a so-so animated flick with so-so actors. I also thought that they could have put more detail into this movie. Compared to the last few 3D movies we've seen, such as Alice In Wonderland and Avatar. This movie is under par with them. So if you want to see an animated movie on 3d I suggest waiting for Toy Story 3 because this is the last time I'm going to be seeing a Dream works made film in 3d.",
580,13 October 2013,gmouhlen,10, Amazing,I can honestly say that this is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I really didn't expect it to be so good. I've been recommending it to everyone because it was such an amazing and beautifully animated film. For those of you who haven't watched it its something you need to add on to your watchlist because you are missing out. The characters in this film were so lovable and this is a film that I'm not going to easily forget and I'm so glad to hear that they are going to be making a second I will definitely be going to see it. I can't really see how anyone could dislike this movie its suitable for all ages. Again I will say this that this film is a must,
581,5 January 2013,andykessinger,9, Brilliant movie,"This is one of the best movies of the decade. Dreamworks did a wonderful job on it, mostly because it is easy for adults, as well as kids to relate to, and there are lessons present for all age groups. The animation was great, the story was great, and the actors used for characters' voices were just right for what the role called for. As with any good movie, every detail is important in its own way, from things that a viewer can't miss, to the little things that can easily go unnoticed. On top of all of these things, the music by John Powell finished it off. Perfectly composed for the movie, the score can tell the story without needing to see the actual movie. So overall, this movie was truly well made, and is worth seeing time and time again.",

584,17 January 2015,bobdiddlebop4899,10, Amazing Movie,This is my favorite movie. I love all the characters. Hiccup doesn't have typical teenage problems he just wants approval in his village. The dragons are all done beautifully. The relationship between Hiccup and Astrid was not dwelt upon and they kept to the task at hand. You don't have to like the movie but I think everyone should at least give it a try. While some people don't like that the adults have accents but the kids don't I find that it symbolizes that the kids brought the change to the village. The twins were an excellent addition to what I call los seis amigos dragones (the six dragon friends). They were funny and Tuffnut is in my top three favorite characters. Overall this was a great movie that I never get tired of no matter how many times I see it.,

I then decided to watch this and to my surprise, it was really beautiful. What I meant was, the story line that truly touches heart between human and animal created the bonding and trust with many form of interactions. That really given me to wanted to own a dragon myself in real life if possible. The flying technique, the get together, train up the little beast, they even have some comedy added on, the true-self for being who you really are, to provide warm to your friend even though toothless is your pet and many more adventures to explore. I am touched and never regret getting that ticket to watch this fascinating movie. I then watched it many times later. Go for it and it is worth watching it. Don't forget to watch Part 2 too.",

Speaking of which, I have nothing but praises for this. First of all the animation is wonderful, especially the flying scenes are just gorgeous. This movie literally has no fillers, It moves straight into the next scene like no time wasted only on what it needs to which is rare in animated films nowadays. The humor just like any other DreamWorks movie lands well, you're constantly laughing through this. But strong emotions are present in this with Hiccup and Toothless constantly saving each other. The message is also really powerful just like anything in this masterpiece. It explores parental expectations, self-worth and etc. In the end just about anyone will be wowing after seeing How to Train Your Dragon. 7th best animated film of all time and easily a 10/10.",

596,11 February 2012,knarf129,1, The worst movie I have ever seen.,"You can't really say you've seen a bad movie until you watch this one. Basically the story goes like this Hiccup, the awkward son of the village chieftain, Stoick the Vast, whom he looks and acts nothing like, dreams of killing a Night Furry, which is said to be impossible. When he actually does, no one believes him. He is too much of a pussy to kill it, so he trains and befriends it. He suddenly learns to train other dragons which other people think he is really tormenting, which makes him a hero. Not everything about this movie is dreadful, the animation is pretty good, but the idea of vikings going against everything they know and domesticating dragons is both blasphemous and dull. It contains lames jokes that are extremely dry. Basically, you will hate this movie, with the notable exception if you are a pasty-face nerd who wears glasses and spends his free time playing world of Warcraft. When it first came out it received positive reviews for some reason, but like most over-rated movies it will be forgot about in a few years.",

All the dragons are portrayed in quite a hilarious manner and the main dragon character, Toothless, was so playful and cute, I couldn't help but smile when watching him and Hiccup bond.

From the beginning I was simply in awe because of how beautifully done the 3D was, and how amazingly it was visually. Although, visuals SHOULD NOT be the only thing to drive a movie forward... but How to Train Your Dragon has it all. The plot immediately caught my interest and held on until after it was all over. It just felt so real... a feeling animated features rarely give me. The strongest factor in this feeling was the character development. Every single character in this film developed and changed in the same ways real people do. Nothing extreme like going from evil to good, but in more subtle ways just as real people do. My personal favorite character was Toothless the ""Night Fury"" dragon. I could not believe how much personality this non speaking creature had...it reminded me so much of how a pet would act in real life only with a bit more intelligence. The musical score and the animation matched (maybe even surpassed) Pixar in quality. See this in 3D as it is meant to be. Visually and emotionally STUNNING!",

My principal objection is to the fact that one spends a great deal of time watching dragons swish their tails around and eat fish and be confused and do other things that are not awesome. It could be protested that this is consistent with the film's likable themes of peaceful coexistence and friendship. I am not interested in excuses; I am interested in seeing cool things happen in movies. A good movie finds ways to let the viewer see awesome things. For example, the terrific family adventure movie Kung-Fu Panda has many great kung-fu fights throughout its entirety. Imagine if the kung-fu fighters always found reasonable excuses to not fight most of the time in that movie. What a bad movie that would be.

The story revolves around Hiccup a young Viking boy who is the son of the chief of a Viking tribe that hunts and kills dragons because they constantly attack and raid the village and so they are at war. When hiccup, luck might have it, successfully shoots down a dragon and begins to befriend the beast. This is where the story becomes excellent, to bond between Hiccup and his new dragon friend Toothless. Hiccup learns to train toothless and builds a contraption that can help him fly. When discovering they both need each other to survive, they become inseparable, and it is up to the two of them to show the rest of the Vikings that dragons can be understood and, with a bit of patience, can be trained like dogs.
This is a movie that respects children and wants them to be invested in the characters for the whole film without getting bored. This film is incredibly successful in doing so by being funny, compelling, and most of all mature. Along with stunning visuals and one of the best musical scores in film history, it was even nominated for Best Original Score at the Oscars, this film delivers on everything you would want to see in a great film.

I felt as if I were lying a sky when I watched the scene. Hiccup and Toothless become best friends. Hiccup was a weakling, but he got courage because of Toothless.

The computer animation was done very well for this movie and you get to see the impressive effects right from the beginning of the movie. They show where the Vikings live from the ocean view and the ocean almost looks lifelike and with the 3D effect it looks like you are right there on the water.

643,29 March 2012,dan-hansen,9, Great Family Entertainment!,"""How To Train Your Dragon"" was just a delightful movie to see. The movie literally starts with a bang. It jumps right into the action, without the build-up stretching out too long. The action scenes were exciting, and very well-animated. Was it just me, or did the water look SO REAL to you people? Anyway, I really liked Hiccup, the main character. Even though he's different than everybody, and the loser of the tribe, he's quite lovable with his little quirks and his sarcastic humor. When he and the dragon become friends, it had to be one of the sweetest moments I've ever seen in a movie. I left the theater, wanting a dragon of my own! Though I didn't see this movie in 3D, it didn't really matter. I actually had an adrenaline rush whenever Hiccup rode the dragon, Toothless, and swerved between mountain and soared over the clouds. May I add, I thought the dragon was adorable! Another great thing about this movie is that the plot was good; there were no plot holes that I saw. I never got bored, and I never took my eyes off the screen. The humor was great, too, and thankfully, lacking of bathroom jokes. This is a must-see for everyone. If you love sweet, fun, funny, thrilling animated movies, then go see this one. In the future, Dreamworks should look to How to Train Your Dragon when they make their next movie, so they'll have a reference to how an animated movie SHOULD be.",

Good animation, that's the best about this flick. The story is mediocre, nothing exciting there. Don't misunderstand me, it does work! But let's be honest, it's not that exciting.... The soundtrack is what you expect it to be, nothing new/innovative there... So: Excellent film for your kids or for an adult who wants some excellent waste-time. But nothing exciting, innovative, surprising... If you're looking for something to rock your world, there's a lot of better animations out there (try Howl's moving castle, Princess Mononoke, ....)",

659,27 October 2013,k-lemoneko,8, Love it!,"Movies like this are my weakness. I just love animation family-movies with cute creatures, can't help it. The 8/10 is only because the animation felt a little bit too raw at some parts, but overall it's a lot of hard work and it looks gorgeous. I honestly didn't mind these minor visual details just because the story itself was so fantastic. Clearly they did their research about vikings and animals behavior (two things that for some reason I know a lot about - I never even realized that about myself). I love how Hiccup's voice is changing when he's speaking, like a real teenage boy. Some of the sweetest character designs ever (I clearly saw how Lilo&Stitch inspired at least a few of them, but Lilo&Stitch has one of the most beautiful designs I've ever seen - so that is actually a serious compliment). All the characters had a very complete personality, and without words, the first act makes you fall in love with the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless. Sweet movie and highly recommended!",

663,16 January 2013,filipecattoni,6, Missed the whole point...,"I am a huge fan of the book series, and I admit, I wouldn't have known about it if not for the movie. But that doesn't excuse it from being as horrible of an adaptation as you can get. The movie itself fairs pretty well. The animation is amazing, definitely Dreamwork's best work. The characters are well developed, though not all of them. The story is pretty okay, and the lesson is the best part (seeing as it is the only thing it kept from the book). I'd easily give it an 8. But as an adaptation this fails on so many levels. The whole point of the book series is that Hiccup is becoming a hero the hard way. The society he lives in values brawn, while Hiccup is only good at brains (well, until he learns he is awesome with swords, but that's besides the point). It is not until they learn that brains is valuable that Hiccup becomes a hero. I don't know this because that's how the book ends, this is merely hinted at. You know why? Because he never actually becomes a hero in the books. He saves Berk, but they still consider him useless for being good only in something not valued. His action doesn't change his person, they still think of him as the same. 10 books of near-death experiences and him saving everybody and he still doesn't become a hero. This is a great lesson: things are hard, and people are douches. You can't just instantly be great. It keeps it real. Hiccup wasn't born a hero, he learned how to be one. He isn't the ""dragon enchanter""; he can barely keep his own dragon from starting a riot. The movie throws this out the window: one good deed and a leg and poof, you're the greatest person ever. The movie is saying that Hiccup is awesome, it's just that no one else can see that. That's not the point. As for the other things, the movie doesn't even try to keep the story, the characters are completely different (even Hiccup), and oh my god, you didn't need to add a love interest! Why? It's not necessary! It's not even the first time you did this (HHGTG)! Anyways, dragonese doesn't even exist, and there's so many missed potentials for great parts from the books to be turned into great scenes in a movie. Anyway, I think this movie is overpraised for taking a good book with a great moral and making it generic.",
664,27 February 2011,arashshahriari,10, Makes it perfect because of the soundtrack,"I have seen this movie around 10 times; on DVD and movie theatre. The plot is great. It made me want to know what goes on even though the story theme is not original. The characters are amazing and lovable. There is somewhat a clever sense of humor. However, the thing that gives this movie a 10/10 and not an 8 or a nine is its amazing soundtrack. John Powell is my favorite composer just because of a few of the songs: Test Drive, Forbidden Friendship, Coming Back Around,Romantic Flight and many more. I loved them so much that i got the music sheets for some of them and am learning to play them on the piano. Hopefully, you guys will enjoy it as much as i did.",
665,24 August 2010,bad-bascomb,7, Odd ending,"In the event that my post give any spoiler info by showing the first line, I'll push any negative comments down a bit. All in all, I did like it. The characters were kind of fun. Some of the vikings did have excellent beards. Sort of predictable, but not to the point of being offensive. After all the bonding in dragon training, I got a distinct ""Mulan""esque feeling about the little vikings. I would prefer to have an all encompassing evil non-dragon, be the ultimate enemy. I thought the characters(vikings-dragons) had gotten to the point that it was all a misunderstanding, and we could all just get along. Maybe the queen-bee mother dragon could have been less bad. And some other super evil thing would justify vikings and dragons to bond against it. And where the blazes did those other hundreds of dragons fly off to? I didn't know how many ""vikings"" had Scottish accents, either. Hmmm. Back to history class for me. OK, I'm sorry to be so picky. I did enjoy the movie, but the ending twisted the wrong way for me.",

I saw this movie rather just to pass the time than to watch it for its sake. And Whoa! I was drawn in this river in first 5 minutes. And what a experience it has been! Right from the start as the narrator describes his world, you are immediately there. You feel yourself in the characters place. The movie does that for you. This is very uncommon movie and it has set a milestone for 3D, not because of its technical aspects, but because of the Depth this movie has. This movie is as much for a 7 year old as it is for an old man who has seen a lot of life. This movie will entertain each viewer in his own way. This is a masterpiece! This movie isn't what it sounds on the surface. It has layers of meanings attached to it. Look at just the title: How to train your Dragon!. If you see it carefully you will notice that there is more to it than meets the eye. Watch the movie and you will know what i mean. This movie cleverly comments on Human Fear, War, Friendship, prejudices, courage, Love. ........................... Don't miss this movie or you will miss one of the few periods when you really LIVE.

680,27 September 2016,calley-00791,8, How to Train Your Dragon Reveals Modern Familial Relationships,"How to Train Your Dragon Reveals Modern Familial Relationships Written for IMDb.com How to Train Your Dragon is a film which reveals the lack of familial relationships in current society through Hiccup's struggle to impress his father, Stoick, and the rest of his village. In this film, Hiccup is a young viking who lives on the island of Berk, beset every night by dragon attacks. Hiccup is small and weak for his age, and is ostracized by the rest of the village. This film follows Hiccup's search for family and friends in a society he does not seem to fit into. Jay Baruchel does a good job of displaying Hiccup as a young boy trying to impress his father, because of how weak he is. Gerard Butler reveals Stoick's character as a busy chieftain who usually has no time for his incompetent son. This reveals the struggles of fathers and sons in real life, with the father usually being too busy to help his son and the son finding that the only way to get his father's attention is to get in trouble. Hiccup ends up, as many children today do, finding a sense of belonging outside of his family, with his dragon Toothless. By the time Stoick starts paying attention to Hiccup, Hiccup has already found his place with a friend who he can always count on, but grows distant from his real family in the process. Children nowadays face similar problems, always searching for a sense of belonging. Their family is often too busy with work and the virtual world, and so the children grow distant from their family and instead come to rely on a group of friends who are very different from their parents. Although the actual volume of sappy emotions in the film is very low, the lack of volume in that area is made up for. The reduction of emotion is compensated by the large amounts of explosive, aerial dragon combat. This film is very similar to a video game in its action and realistic quality. Overall, the directors, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, wrote an engaging and exciting movie that is an accurate depiction of the relationship between children and parents today.",
681,10 July 2017,pescavelho,8," Out of all clichÃ© movies, this is the best one.","The story is a bit weak as it is a combination of two clichÃ© stories, however, the execution of it can make it enjoyable, so despite being a clichÃ© story, it is not a boring one. The animation is the strongest aspect of the movie, from the backgrounds, to the character design, everything is beautiful. The flight scenes are really engaging and are almost indescribable because of how beautiful they are. However the two things that make me itch a bit the animation are the textures and the dragon's design. The textures are nice, but the human skin needs a bit more polish. The designs of the dragons are good, but they feel a bit out of place in this mostly realistic movie (Toothless does not count because it's design was inspired by Stitch). The characters are arguably the weakest point of the movie. Hiccup is a likable character, but some people might find that the movie is forcing the audience to like him. Stoick is in my opinion the most likable character. The relationship between Astrid and Hiccup also feels a bit forced but it can have its food moments. The rest are mostly comic reliefs that despite feeling a bit clichÃ©, can have their good moments. Like the story, the characters might be clichÃ©, but their execution makes them likable. I recommend this to people who give more importance to visuals rather than story or characters.",
