My timing is kind of serendipitous too because Scotland will be voting on leaving the UK next week on September 18th, 2014 as I write this.

9,13 December 2015,Leofwine_draca,10, Historical war par excellence,"One of the early ""historical epics"" to set off a still-current wave of ancient adventures, this is epic, grand stuff spoiled only slightly by a twinge of Hollywoodian uneasiness and a little overloading of sentimentality. It isn't as bad as in something like, say, ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES but it isn't mastered to the extent it was in GLADIATOR either. Although history is sometimes rewritten and distinctions are blurred, this is a moving masterpiece with a sweeping score and splendid visuals to boot.",w

11,6 January 2010,hitchcockthelegend,10," Historical flaws aside, Braveheart is a rousing spectacle.","So it comes to pass in the year of 1995 (not a year of our lord I think) that Mel Gibson would craft the award winning epic that is Braveheart, a film that is historically bent in the extreme, that is directed by a man who would go on to have a less than favourable character reputation, and a film that has a heavy handed approach at times. It's also as choppy as a boat ride during a tidal wave, so yes, Braveheart is far from flawless folks. Yet the structure, the epic emotional swirls and sheer spectacle of it all marks it out as a rousing treat.",3
12,21 July 2009,kosmasp,9, Masterpiece,"Mel Gibson not only stars, but also directs one of the greatest historical movies, that have ever been made. While I'm not aware of the historical facts and what parts might be true or not, the appeal of the movie is undeniable.",5
13,3 May 2023,klindon-38400,9, My favorite Mel Gibson film,"I'm a fan of super intense acting performances. Intensity to me is what I think people call star power or charisma. Lethal Weapon is one of those movies where his intensity is on full display but he has a different kind of thing going on here. He's a tad older, wiser, gets accosted personally and his livelihood, so his intensity is of a different ilk. He's crazy in Lethal Weapon but in Braveheart he's completely intense while being completely sane at the same time. All of his actions in this film are justified. You're rooting for him from frame one. This is the best film he's ever been in and possible ever will be.",7
14,27 November 2005,Jakethemuss,9, Wallace's courage is inspiring,"This epic tale of patriotism, love and conflict opens with a birds eye view which takes you through mist and air out onto an open loch with scenic mountains in the background.

15,7 February 2015,ma-cortes,8, Epic recreation about a notorious Scottish hero who purposes to free his country from the tyranny of Edward I,"In 14th Century Scotland, when his secret bride is executed for assaulting an English soldier who tried to rape her, William Wallace begins a revolt and leads Scottish warriors against the cruel English tyrant , the nasty ruler Edward I (Patrick McGoohan)the Longshanks (as he was called ""The Longshanks"" -long legs- since he was uncommonly tall for a man of the time , Edward I was at least 6 feet, 2 inches) who wishes to inherit the crown of Scotland for himself , ruling Scotland with an iron fist and succeeded his effeminate homosexual son Edward II Prince Edward (he was indeed the first English prince to carry the title Prince of Wales, although he did not marry Princess Isabella until 1308, after both Wallace (1305) and Edward I (1307) had died) . As William Wallace begins his long quest to make Scotland free once and for all, along with the assistance of Robert the Bruce. There took place several battles such as Stirling , York (though the sacking of York was invented for the movie ,Wallace never got as far south as York during his invasion of northern England) and the famous Battle of Falkirk (July 22, 1298), in which the English army was personally led by King Edward I, who decisively defeated the Scots , the real-life King Edward I was a military genius who learned combat tactics while fighting the Mamelukes during the Eighth and Ninth Crusades . There also appears Robert the Bruce , though many Scots were offended by the film's portrayal of Robert the Bruce (Angus McFayden) , who is considered a National Hero of Scotland . ",1
16,27 December 2020,katari24,10, I'd give it more if i could,I watched it years ago and just now and will definitely watch it again.. I feel like you can't rate it it's just beyond that it's so beautiful and it's epic. One of the best movies ever made. Mel Gibson is a true legend.,6
17,13 September 2005,rutan07,10, Best movie ever,"Most on this site pick the Godfather, or the Shawshank Redemption, but this is it, this is the best film ever made. People will complain, will argue that I am wrong, but I will say it again...Braveheart is as close to perfection as a movie can be. The acting is superb, the man who played Lonshanks, the actor who portrayed Robert the Bruce, both should have been nominated for Oscars due to their powerful rendering of evil and a man who is saved from losing his humanity (from becoming evil) by meeting William Wallace. And let us not forget the direction, the cinematography. Braveheart is glorious, beautiful to look at. The slow motion pictures of horses preparing to charge armed combatants, the entire landscape of Scotland that Mel Gibson captures with the camera. Braveheart is artwork, it is as good as any picture. That the film is number 93 on the list of the top 250 movies ever is a shame. Yes there is violence in this film but that violence does serve a point...that freedom isn't free and sometimes it takes death, gruesome and horrible, to let ones people taste what it is like to be free. Braveheart is a great movie and it deserves to at least be in the top ten of IMDb's list of greatest films.",/
18,14 December 2022,freethinkingworld,7, After Thoughts,"So look, I like this movie, I even have nostalgia for this movie......it shouldn't be on the list for greatest movies of all time üòÖüòÖ. It's a good, fun film. The effects and battles are fun and exciting. I love reqatching the battle sense. But this movie can be rather dull in some places, and like everyone says, it is historically inaccurate. But! I don't penalize it as much as some people do for being historically inaccurate, I just had to point it out. I find that hardly any movies are accurate to History as it would make a dull film, so I understand where they are coming from. But non the less, fun great film....just overrated a bit.",?
19,8 January 2014,SnoopyStyle,8, Rip Roaring Fun,William Wallace (Mel Gibson) is the son of a minor landowner who was killed by Longshanks' treachery. He would start a revolt after his secret wife was executed unjustly. The revolt would grow to an all out war against the tyrannical king of England.,r
20,13 December 2004,suiko,10, A flurry of emotions to move you in every direction (at least once),"Unfortunately, I have yet to find a film of quite this caliber again. Braveheart contains elements of Romance (several heart- wrenching and warming instances), Epic/Action (spectacular scenes), Mystery (can take a few viewings to put it all together), History (albeit romanticised) and of course Drama (perfectly unravelled). This level of uncompromised multi-tasking allows the film to move you to laugh and cry, love and hate or even to think and be taught. I'm trying to avoid the clich√©s of glowing reviews (almost as bad as entirely negative ones) - but this is one of the few movies that I feel deserves one.",e
21,8 November 1999,BradFan-2,10, superbly acted and directed,"If you are a Mel Gibson fan of any sorts this movie is a must see. A wonderful directing job, supported by a wonderful cast. Men will appreciate the attitude depicted by Mel Gibson towards his love and his country along with the added violence. Women will swoon and pine for the hopeless romantic they will find in Mel as he avenges the death of his wife and fights for the freedom of his fellow countrymen. This movie gave me a whole new respect for Mel as a director and actor. In my opinion it is the best movie Mel has made to date.",f
22,28 February 2007,delamericano,8, One of the best films ever made,"In this spectacular, historic movie a young Scotsman becomes the hero of his country, after his wife gets killed by the members of the English occupying force. In the beginning of the movie young William Wallace experience the death of his father and brother. They get killed by the English Kings Soldiers. After this he grows up with his uncle. Years later Wallace (Mel Gibson) returns back to the farm of his father to fall in love Murron (Catherine McCormack), the same girl who gave him a flower after the burial of his father and brother years ago. Because the English noblemen have the right to deflower every new married girl, Wallace marries Murron in secret. But the young luck won't last forlong. A few English soldiers try to rape Murron at a marketplace. Wallace tries to rescue her but the agressors can catch her and kill her right on the marketplace. When Wallace finds out about it, he takes revenge. He executes the murderers of his beloved. This ation is like a wake-up call for his fellow countrymen. They see him as their Leader to defeat the English occupying power. In their first battle the highlanders accomplish to defeat a numeral superior English Force. Wallace becomes an inspiration and more and more Scottish people follow him into war. Meanwhile in England the tyrannic King Edward the Longshankes (Patrick Mc Goohan) takes notice of the triumphs of Wallace. But this is not his only problem: His and heir apparent is a mollycoddled coward, who doesn't behave like his father would like to see it from a Prince. At least Edward the Longshakes arrange the marriage between his son and the lovely Princess Isabelle of France (Sophie Marceau). Besides this the Kings health is not the best anymore. But not only the English have their problems: The Scottish Landlords betray each other for more land and try to get more land for themselves from the English King. During the movie you'll see a lot of great filmed battles, two heart breaking love storys (first between Wallace and Murron, later in the movie young princess Isabelle falls in love with Wallace) and an exciting story about love, hate, patriotism, deception and heroism all in front of a wonderful landscape (the movie was actually set in Ireland). When you watch this movie, you'll be carried away by this powerful and always haunting epic and unterstand why there was no other chance than giving this movie 5 Oscars (including the award for the best film). It is a film who has it all: A great story, perfect filmed battles, one of the best soundtracks ever made (it is a shame, that the score didn't win an Oscar) and a hell of a cast. The role of William Wallace fits Mel Gibson perfect: heroic, romantic but always in a down to earth kind of way. Sophie Marceau and Catherine McCormack are lovely from their first appearance until the end of the film and Patrick McGoohan gives the most despicable (this is meant as a compliment) interpretation of an English King ever seen. This movie you can see over and over again and it never looses his magic and it is a movie you can watch with men and women as well: Men will love the great staged battles and women will love the lovestory.",_
23,19 November 2005,high_voltage_41,10, Simply amazing,"I remember seeing this movie for the first time in late 2003, and I was impressed. I saw it again last night, and I was even more impressed. The acting is amazing, and the ending was brilliant. For me, all my guesses were incorrect. Everything that happens in this movie in unpredicted. The last half hour itself was highly unpredictable, and it had a powerful message. When a scene was meant to be dramatic, they did a great job at it. I don't know about everybody else, but the ending did make me cry. The message the movie sent kept me thinking for a while. The amount of courage and bravery was inconceivable, there was barely any faults or anything wrong with the movie. For a movie of 1995, they did a great job.",=
24,29 March 2008,freemantle_uk,4," Awful, AWFUL Film",I hate Braveheart! As an Englishman and as a history student I am insulted by this film.

26,4 August 2013,lesleyharris30,9," Simply Breathtaking,","Braveheart is an absolute fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline that contains both a lot of action and a lot of heart,with very strong,powerful and inspired performances.Even for people who aren't from Scotland,this movie gives you great pride from the country you came from,it is all beautifully made and William Wallace is without a doubt Mel Gibson's finest performance,and his most impressive movie as a director.I also loved Brendan Gleeson in this movie,he isn't a very important character,but he is such a good actor and gave me so much pride for the country I come from,Ireland.Braveheart is a highly recommend movie for all moviegoers,those five Academy Awards don't lie.",_
27,17 November 2004,zwei,10, Je-ne-sais-quoi-ly great!,"Unfortunately, I wasn't able to watch Braveheart till 2003 when it was on TV. However, the lack of theatrical effects never stopped me from being mesmerized by this epic for one moment. So mesmerized, I literally sat motionlessly on the couch for two minutes after the movie. Any normal audience would likely to cast his/her sense of reality away and be captivated by this distant Celtic saga. ",u
28,12 July 2006,jdkraus,10, The Best film of all time!,"There are many criticisms about how inaccurate this film is to the real William Wallace. But i have to say to the by-the-book historians to shut up and enjoy the greatest film ever made! Braveheart is obviously about William Wallace's tale against the English in the medieval days. Mel Gibson's direction is beautifully done, with countless aerial views of the fair land of Scotland, which pulls the viewer into the film's romantic vision of a wonderful land and gives them all the background information you need to know about the land, with the help of the cinematography by John Toll. The music composed the famous James Horner fits the vision with a powerful flow that deepens the story into something amazing. ",r
29,2 September 2005,raidbers,10, Man vs King,"This has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. I recently purchased it and have watched it at least five times since then, and each time i pick up on things I did not see the other times. The fight scenes are great, the plot is both interesting and thought provoking, there is romance and comedy. This is a movie that any person can appreciate at some level. ",v
30,26 April 2014,RossRivero99,10, A Masterpiece,"Mel Gibson's Braveheart is a powerful historical epic that tells the story of a man named William Wallace and how he fought for the freedom of Scotland. The movie stars Mel Gibson as Wallace a man who was devoted to his country's natural rights. Director and star Mel Gibson really knows the history behind how Scotland got their independence from England, this movie has a similar story to Gandhi by Richard Attenborough in which both of those films had only one thing in common both Scotland and India wanted independence from England but in different centuries. What Mel Gibson tries to teach us from this film is how much of a hero that William Wallace was in real life at the time he was alive. Also the musical score by James Horner was just plain perfect for the movie itself. Also the movie compares to epic historical masterpieces like Schindler's List, Lincoln,Gandhi,Saving Private Ryan, The Great Escape, and many more.",
31,13 January 2021,patches89,10, FREEDOOOOOOOOOOM!,One of my favourite all time movies. The story centres around William Wallace a historical figure who lead a group of warriors to claim freedom from English rule. This film takes some liberties with history and is inaccurate in many areas but Mel Gibson's portrayal of Wallace and Patrick McGoohan as King Edward were great. The battles were brilliantly choreographed and whilst I dunno if the film was ever worthy of an oscar its a wonderful film,
32,12 June 2010,Rectangular_businessman,1, Terrible movie.,"Very silly ego trip by a forty-something star(Mel Gibson) past his prime, playing a twenty-something year old Scottish patriot with blue paint on his face, courting a leading lady who could be his granddaughter. Boring and dumb film without any single redeeming element.",
33,18 July 2001,NEFARlOUS,1," Enjoyable romp but oh, the inaccuracies!","This is a well-constructed film with many fine performances - I truly enjoyed it the first time I saw it. In fact I enjoyed it so much, I was curious to find how much of it was true - unfortunately very little.",

35,16 March 2006,Lady_Targaryen,10," Every man dies, not every man really lives.","''Braveheart'' is one of the greatest movies I already watched in my life. Really, it will be hard to find the exact words to write a review about it, but I will try. It's the story of the Scottish hero William Wallace,and Mel Gibson, even being older then the expected for the role, is great as director and actor, and I think this movie totally deserved to have won Best Cinematography,Best Picture and Best Director.",
36,13 February 2007,pwfinch,1, Medieval superman takes on evil empire in revisionist epic,"Shockingly one-sided portrayal of real, tragic events that left thousands of innocents dead on both sides of the Anglo-Scottish border.",
37,11 January 2010,quinnox-1,1," Oh my god, howlingly bad","I just watched this, although it took me days to finally finish watching this 3 hour bloated boring movie in its entirety.

38,17 February 2020,thiendang-67251,10," My favorite movie, ever",This is genuinely one of the greatest piece in cinema history.,
39,22 March 2006,Caz1964,1, Another fine mess from Mel Gibson,"How this film won so many Oscars is beyond me.To start with its totally inaccurate,it looks like a typical excuse for Mel Gibson to try and look macho and at the same time practice his racial hatred on us English.I don't know about anyone else,but i saw this film about ten years ago and the thing i remember most about it apart from his silly hairdo,was the sheer offensiveness of it,I've never watched it since.He implies that the kings son was homosexual,which there's no evidence of,and then implies that homosexuals are evil people,how bad is that in the 20th century.Films have been banned for implying a lot less.But on the whole why cant he just leave our history alone and do something useful like make a film about the Aborigines or the American Red Indians,which is more his neck of the woods,not tear British history apart with how he wants to see it.I'm worried that he may try and make a version of the Battle of Britain,could you imagine it,he would probably portray the English as sitting around drinking tea saying,go on taffy and jock old boy go and kill some Hun for us ha ha tally ho.It would be that bad.",
40,2 January 2021,joiningjt,10, This is what a MASTERPIECE looks like!! This is a perfect 10!! Phenomenal!!!,"This is a movie that no matter how many times you watch it you still get fired up and emotions are at full tilt!! Every actor was phenomenal and how it didnt get oscar nods for best actor and best supporting actor is a travesty, Brendan Gleason was easily a winner, so was mel Gibson he was portraying a legend who was much bigger in stature and larger than life itself yet mr Gibson pulls it off with ease. He should have been nominated for best actor but as always the case with the political Oscar's this movie got ripped off. They knew they had no choice but to give it best picture and director but it deserved more. With out a doubt in the top 10 best movies ever made!!!!!!!!",
41,30 May 2001,chris.murray3,1, Let he whose country is without sin cast the first stone.,"I think that to even things up Hollywood should finance a motion picture in which Sean Connery, playing an Aborigine, leads his people in an uprising against their white Australian oppressors! If nothing else it would give Mel""Patriot"" Gibson an overdue taste of his own medicine. Now if you will kindly excuse me, being English, I have some evil to go and do.",
42,28 April 2000,Quinoa1984,9," Gibson's best as director- melodramatic in better than expected measure, with bloody violence","It was too much to take in upon first trying to watch Braveheart when I was younger. It's story is not terribly complicated, in fact it almost resembles (when taking it out historical context, which is not completely accurate to the film anyway) a 13th century Scottish version of the Mad Max series- Wallace's wife gets killed by the English, he gets revenge, and then some; he faces off in battles to finally gain freedom for Scotland. Clad in blue make-up, using his ""they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!"" speech, charging ahead, and getting into a truly bloody battle that is only rivaled in 90s war/epic movie-making by Saving Private Ryan, this was what I remembered most from Braveheart when also first writing my comments. Seeing it today it's a totally different experience, as taking in the story it's very well told, with excellent performances that emphasize- unlike in Gibson's Passion of the Christ- that he can really get belief out of melodramatic performances. And when he does get his cameras up into the nitty gritty of violent confrontations, be them small (when he first takes his vengeance on the British after his wife's slaughtered, which itself is a very powerful scene) or large (previously mentioned battle), it's with a vitality and viciousness that rarely gets into Hollywood productions. There are even moments of fun (flashing the British, to 'kiss arse') and close-to-poetry (Wallace's death). It's a handsomely done work that should stand the test of time in Gibson's oeuvre. One of the best films of 1995.",
43,26 April 2017,KingBrian1,7, Up Scotland,"A stunningly beautiful move that has no historical merit at all Mel Gibson has won the adulation of the world and most importantly the Scots. It captures the honour of the Scots. By today's standards the stereotypes are all in there. The prejudicial Irish, the dastardly English King so if your easily offended stay away from this film. But this film is about landscape, tragedy of lost romance and lots and lots of bloody violence. The action and costumes alone is what makes this film incredible. The movie is a giant re-enactment of ancient Anglo- Scottish rivalry. All Gibson did was point the camera at a beautiful countryside and have fun. So it is a truly exciting film.",
44,19 February 2014,Essex_Rider,1, Historically inaccurate and unbelievable.,"To be fair, viewed as a cinematic project, this was good with very realistic battle scenes and overall landscape. However, from a historical point of view, it is utter tripe. On 25 January 1308, Edward II married Isabella of France, yet the movie purports to have Wallace impregnate the princess of Wales at some point before he died while she is married to Edward II. Yet the 'fact' is, Wallace was executed three years before the Princess was even married. Given that the princess didn't give birth until 1312, that must have been one heck of a gestation period, 7 years to be exact. Also, at the battle of Stirling, or more accurately 'The Battle of Stirling Bridge', Wallace did not defeat heavy chivalry using lines of disciplined troops carrying long stave's. He defeated the English because the English were forced to cross a narrow bridge, and once penned in, they were easier to kill. This was compounded by the rout into the cavalry and the collapse of the bridge leading to many troops drowning. Wallace was a guerrilla fighter, not a strategist. This might have been a great movie if Mel Gibson had kept to the truth, as it is, it is a seriously marred piece of sensationalist anti-English hokum that would be more at home as a work of fiction that one supposedly based on fact.",
45,24 September 2004,byght,5," Unremarkable, shallow epic",Why this passable but completely forgettable film has apparently garnered a reputation as a classic in the last decade is beyond me. There's really not much to write home about here. ,
46,14 November 2004,FilmSnobby,3, Long-winded; simple-minded; ultimately disturbing.,I had liked Mel Gibson's *Braveheart* a bit better 9 years ago when I first saw it; but that was 9 years ago. 9 more years of experience in both life and movie-watching has revealed to me this film's inadequacies upon a re-viewing on a TV broadcast.,
47,4 June 2000,m.cordell,1, Offensive in every Sense,"Mel Gibson, instead of stirring up trouble in the UK, should instead go back to his own country and perhaps make a film about Aboriginal oppression and their struggle for land rights. The Americans love this movie because it is a simplistic and factually incorrect representation of freedom fighting that they think fits in with their own struggle against the British. Why are we always the bad guys?",
48,4 March 2012,ScottAmundsen,5," When Director and Star are the Same Person, the Results are Often Disappointing","Generally speaking, it is not a good idea for an actor to double as both director and star of the same film. Orson Welles did it, and was good at it, but he was a special case. And Jodie Foster had a qualified success with LITTLE MAN TATE, but her character was on the periphery of much of the story.",
49,30 December 2011,kenjha,4, Inept Epic,"In the 13th century, Scots battle to overthrow the English and gain independence. This is nothing but a big, bloated turkey that seems like it's never going to end. It is not clear where Gibson is worse - the hammy performance in front of the camera or the inept direction behind it. Gibson often has the camera linger on himself as he strikes heroic poses. Too much screen time is devoted to bloody battle scenes, causing the film to become increasingly tedious. The only respite from the repulsive bloodbath is romantic scenes that look like shampoo commercials. We also have Gibson to thank for showing us what's under those kilts.",

52,21 March 2006,VicTheDaddy,1, crap,"The scenery is nice,costumes are good, acting not bad,but that is about it.What is it with Mel Gibson and his anti English feelings.I find him dangerous in modern day film making,he takes a story and twists it around with out knowing anything about our history and comes up with these very offensive anti English films,almost like Hitler and his anti semitic propaganda.According to him English men are either gay,rapists,murderers,torturers,we are yet to see how he wants to portray English women,ma by he thinks their lesbian prostitutes who go around murdering small boys, please don't give him ideas.The worst thing of all is that the film is set many centuries ago when every one was barbaric to one another,he makes it look like it was last week.I'm an Englisman who has Scots and Irish friends,and all actor /directors, if you can call him that do is just stir up trouble.He knows nothing about our history so he should stay out of it,leave it to the professionals,like Richard Attenborough.",

54,13 November 2005,rebeljenn,2, Overrated,"Braveheart is an over-rated historical epic which is much over-rated. The film stars Mel Gibson, and the film seems to portray him in one of these idolised images of heroes that is so common in the majority of films he stars in. I don't know why the mainstream have embraced this film. Maybe they thought it sounded good to say that they had seen it and they enjoyed it. Maybe Gibson does excel in alluring mainstream people to the cinema to watch historical epics. Whatever it is, I had a lot of problems with this film. It is a typical Hollywood blockbuster, and maybe that is what the problem is. Too much action, a rushed story, and a long film that seems to lack in direction but uses cheap and tacky dialogue to bring Mel Gibson up to a hero status, particularly when he gives a moving and emotional speech about freedom. (I am sure that these words can be compared to other events, particularly in American history, and maybe these are more reasons why the film was so loved.) As a film, I had trouble sitting through it because it was not interesting, and I found several areas to be comical (unintentionally, I don't think the director wanted this to be a comical film). My verdict: over-rated and not recommended unless you like Mel Gibson or you disagree with this post.",

This is a grand romantic vision of the fight for freedom and casting off the yoke of oppression. James Horner's wonderfully moving, romantic score adds tremendously to the film. The most moving scenes for me are the interactions with the women whom Wallace loved, starting with a wonderful scene of the young Murron (the expression on the face of the little girl playing her is movie perfection) presenting him with a flower at his father's funeral, and moving on to their adult courtship and far too brief marriage, and ending with his interaction with the exquisitely beautiful Sophie Marceau as Isabelle.

Therefore the Scottish were not fighting Britain and anyone who writes a review featuring that statement is well worth avoiding. Group 2 are the people who will mention the historical accuracies. Whether or not you read those reviews is very much up to you. If you want mindless entertainment dont bother with them. If you want educating read away as you might learn something.

The homophobia is horrific, and the film's bigotries and allegiances seem aimed at football hooligans, republicans and thugs.

Some strange facts about this fiction were that the English king actually spoke English, as did his soldiers, who themselves identified as English, when historically you're looking at a would-be further Norman conquest further into Britain.  Also, it appears that many Americans, and now many other nationalities (thanks Mel) seem to think that Scotland and Britain are separate entities.  If ever there is a Braveheart II, which portrays Scottish raids and invasions into pre-Norman Northumbria, Cumbria, Yorkshire, which shows how the Scots conquered the English city of Edinburgh and made it their capital, which awakens in 50 million Irish Americans a sense of their English heritage (hahaha), I'd watch it.

It regards William Wallace whose father and brother were slain when he was a boy. Taken in by his uncle, he grows to lead a rebellion against England after his wife is publicly executed. Mel Gibson presents impressive battle sequences as Wallace aligns with other villages in an attempt to form an army to overthrow King Edward 1 of England. Gibson portrays Wallace as a man bent on freedom to the point of death, and he is faced with many victories as well as betrayals. When he yells out the word, ""freedom"", he does so during his darkest moment. Sophie Marceau plays the Princess to the King's young feeble Prince. She is sent as a form of information and decoy but she becomes enamored with Wallace and warns him of danger. Patrick McGoohan as King Edward 1 is a thunderous villain ruler bent on conquering opposition until he lay on his death bed with words whispered into his conscience that embed worse than his greatest defeat. Catherine McCormack plays Wallace's wife who falls victim to the King's rule that enables his bids on newly brides. Angus Macfadyen is featured as someone whom Wallace seeks assistance from.

The accuracy of the battle scenes are only eclipsed by the expressions of the actors faces as they share this story. Stephen the Irishman steals the show with his plucky comic relief.

Mel Gibson portrayed a great William Wallace who was deeply in love with a woman he knew immediately was going to be his soul mate and the King of England had other plans for this relationship as England had complete control over Scotland and had the idea that every newly married Scotish bride was to be shared with an Englishman and integrated their blood relations in order to break down the struggle of Scotland wanting to be free from England.

83,11 November 2006,David_Frames,5, Monty Python's History of Britain,"The colonial chip on Mel Gibson's shoulder is so large in this pure Hollywood re-imagining of English-Scottish history that more often than not it threatens to cave in one side of the director's body, leaving him a crippled, diseased ghoul dragging the divided dead flesh through the mud, trying to say ""Freedom"" through a sore covered, misshapen mouth. Unfortunately this didn't happen to Gibson, instead his survived untouched to give us this take on English aggression, so one sided and ludicrous it could have been filmed by Dr Joseph Goebbels' film bureau ¬ñin fact much like it exists in the Nazi's back catalogue. This skirts around the truth about Braveheart, namely that it's the product of a filmmaker/actor who's an abhorrent anti-Semite, right wing bigot and drunk who's barely disguised prejudice masks what can only be generously described as a selective attitude toward repression and the subjugation of entire peoples. Substitute the Scottish for the Jews for example and it's hard to imagine the pendulum swinging quite so far toward the persecuted. It's okay to paint the English as caricatures of course because it's set in the 13th century and who cares about the contemporaneous message when it's smeared in the long long ago, right? Tell that to the Scots. Gibson's tale of the boo-hiss moustache twirling Anglo-Saxons raping their women, hanging their manfolk and the like, went a long a way to reigniting the fervent and somewhat pernicious strain of nationalism that has always lain at the heart of the Scottish psyche. Finally here was the movie that said that anti-English bigotry was okay, even to be encouraged ¬ñ a green light for the simpleminded. Yes, that's right my wee lads and lassies, all that crap your Mum and Dad told you about the English being arrogant, domineering scum who'd repressed your people for hundreds of years had now received the patronage of film. That's even better than reality isn't it? In any event once it's on film it's almost true anyway surely so even if the film's thrust is dishonest and the stuff of folklore invention it hardly matters. Gibson, with his blue face paint and poster-boy speeches for freedom (as long as you're a gentile of course) waved the flag for imagined tyranny in a country that had benefited from the Union with England financially and culturally for 300 years. The likes of the SNP, the political wing of Scottish bigotry and that occasional patriot, the tax exile Sean Connery all leaped on the bandwagon ensuring Gibson's iconic status from Berwick to Banff. The problem and I'm sorry to break this to any Celtic readers, is that photographing a propaganda piece with reality left to watch from behind the camera doesn't make any of it true. Gibson's film may be effectively packaged, romantically scored and crafted to stoke the fire of audience hatred but beyond all of that its true significance lies in the revealing hand of its director and the reaction of the people it purports to represent. Ironically the only ones to emerge from the film with any dignity are the vilified English ¬ñ a patient audience if ever there was one.",

Braveheart ranks right up there with Titanic and Pearl Harbor as prime examples of what's wrong with Hollywood historical epics.  They take a rich and complex history or event and dumb it down for the viewing public into a shallow tale of revenge, love and death.  Emotions are over-the-top and characters are either good or bad. Strangely enough, considering its reputation among some people as being mindless entertainment drivel, I feel Gladiator is a much better film, despite all the sneers that Gladiator aped Braveheart.  Gladiator took the elements that floundered in Braveheart and made it much more satisfying, visually and dramatically.  Compare Maximus's quiet death, as he finally reaches his family on the other side, with Wallace's leatherlung scream of ""FREEDOM!"" delivered on the soaring wave of a pulse-pounding, throat-catching orchestral surge that you would find only in a Hollywood epic.  I look at Braveheart as a supreme egotrip by a moderately talented actor.  Mel Gibson needs a good director to keep him in line so he doesn't grandstand, and Emmerich succeeded to some degree in The Patriot.  Throw in the shameful historical inaccuracies and the blatant gay-bashing (Mel has a few personal agendas) and you have a long film that bores and exasperates.",

It is poignant, action packed, splendidly directed with such an awful and cruel, but outstanding ending, that is why this film is so different from GLADIATOR and SPARTACUS. I have rarely seen such a cruel ending for a hero, because in this film, Gibson is the hero, not the anti hero as he will be for EDGE OF DARKNESS, BLOOD FATHER or DRAGGED ACROSS CONCRETE. I remember such a sad ending in JOHNNY COOL, starring Henry Silva, also the hero, but he was a gangster, a ruthless one. Also BARRABAS, with Anthony Quinn.

96,4 June 2002,bigchiefmullet,1, Rule Britannia,someone previously attacked the English for being Norman/Saxon in origin and for being invaders. That is a very simplistic view of things. For a start William Wallace himself was descended from a minor Norman lord. Does this mean he too was an invader ? most of the lowland Scots had Anglo-Saxon blood in them. The easiest way to view Englands invasions is that England was a potentially powerful nation but as long as it had enemies who were able to mount serious raids (and often did) She could not influence the world. it is no coincidence that when the British Isles were united they went on to forge the greatest empire the World had seen. So when you slam someone for being proud of Englands military achievements bear in mind that those military achievements laid the base on which the cultural achievements lay.,
97,30 June 2020,dr_clarke_2,5," Entertaining, but hard to take seriously","Mel Gibson's 1995 film Braveheart is on odd beast. It's a film that tends to crop up on lists of the worst films to have won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and much of the ire directed against it stems from either its galloping historical inaccuracy or the fact that Gibson's reputation has been tainted since the film was made by a variety of ill-advised and distasteful comments. But neither of these things is reason to objectively judge a film by; Gibson's behaviour since has no bearing on the quality of the film or lack thereof, and it doesn't claim to be historical documentary.
Nevertheless, it has to be admitted that a basic knowledge of British history from the period in which the film is set does make it quite hard to take the movie seriously. Amusingly, one of the opening lines is ""history is written by those who have hanged heroes"", which in retrospect seems like a feeble attempt to stave off criticism (it didn't work). Appreciation of Braveheart works best if you assume that it's about as historically accurate One Million Years B.C., which is indeed the case. When script writer Randall Wallace was later challenged about this, he said of his source material (Blind Harry's The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace, written in the fifteenth century) ""Is Blind Harry true? I don't know."" The correct answer of course, is no, it isn't.
But if you can treat Braveheart purely as a fantasy epic there are still problems. Patrick McGoohan is encouraged to play King Edward I as a pantomime villain who authorises rape to teach the troublesome Scots a lesson, and although his performance is one of the most entertaining things in the film, the reduction of Medieval Anglo-Scottish affairs to a situation in which the English are represented as pure evil is one of the reasons that the film faced accusations of Anglophobia. Although frankly, it's all too silly to take offense at and in any case, the film's dubious portrayal of Robert the Bruce doesn't do Scotland any favours either. More distasteful is the depiction of the future Edward II as effete and ineffectual, possibly reflecting the real-life homophobia of which Gibson has been accused.
And yet for all of this, Braveheart actually works quite well in many respects. Mel Gibson, who had already directed his first film (Man Without a Face) by this point, apparently took on the project with enormous enthusiasm and it shows. The mise-en-sc√©ne includes costumes and sets that boast the sort of lavish spectacle Hollywood was once renowned for, and the location filming in Scotland and Ireland is shown off in all its glory. The film is also, as with Gibson's two subsequent directorial efforts, spectacularly violent, from Murran having her throat slit in public, through the impressively staged battles, to the somewhat over-the-top denouement in which Wallace is messily executed; whether or not this is a good thing is a matter of opinion, but if nothing else it helps to make the actions sequences look awesome. Despite the lack of a bridge, the Battle of Stirling Bridge is one of the most impressive sequences in the film, involving hundreds of extras, mechanical horses and inexplicable woad. John Toll's cinematography during the battle gets right into the bloody thick of the fighting, drawing the audience into the noise and chaos. Equally impressive is the attack on York. James Horner's score adds a great deal to the film's atmosphere.
Gibson also stars and plays Wallace as a ginger-wigged, mysteriously clean-shaven, Scottish-accented version of his familiar screen persona, and is far more movie star than actor. He just about has enough on-screen charisma to pull it off. He also assembles a fine cast of largely Scottish, Irish and English character actors, including Brendan Gleeson, James Cosmo, David O'Hara, Ian Bannen, Tommy Flanagan, Peter Ullan, Bernard Horsfall, Alun Armstrong and Michael Byrne, all of whom take their roles admirably seriously, and in doing so give the movie the air of a serious drama. The characterisation is fairly simplistic, with Wallace's love affair with Sophie Marceau's Princess Isabella not entirely convincing, and the whole thing has more in common with melodrama than the historical epics it's sometimes erroneously likened to.
A quarter of a century after it was made, Braveheart now looks rather like grand folly. But it's visually stunning and often great fun; it probably shouldn't have won a Best Picture Oscar, but it's not a wholly bad slice of cinematic entertainment.",

People who say it is historically inaccurate do not know what they are taking about. They probably just have some hate on for Mel Gibson. You like history see this movie. This one of the best history movies ever. It is not a family friendly movie. Which is good thing because I hate family friendly movie. I think they suck.

There is nothing to say about this movie except that it is among one of the best war epics ever made in addition to just be a masterpiece of a film in any genre. This film is brutally realistic, not sugar coated by scenes of touching moments or too much of a love story...that being said, the film is very powerful. Here we have a man, Wlliam Wallace, who's determination to unite and gain independence was incredibly moving. Everything about Braveheart is near flawless. One thing that stands out is the music which just makes you want to cry...not because it is depressing but because it adds to the incredible emotional aspect of this film.",

What does that mean? Any film based on an historical event should try to follow some factual truth. Granted some liberties need to be taken but it should be done in a way that has a sense of realism and not filled with goofy Hollywood BS. For example just prior to the first battle with Longshanks army, Wallace's men moon the British from a distance. Now come on!! Do you really think this happened? And what is with the crazy Scot that says the F-word that we are suppose to find funny. Was the F-word even used in those days? Granted the battle scenes are well photographed but I would think the British army would have held their own better in combat with the Scots rather than appearing like some amateur confused bunch of boobs. The only highlight in this film was Patrick McGoohan. His performance was convincing. However when Mel Gibson yelled ""FREEDOM"" at the end when he was dying he took the words out of my mouth.....freedom from this overrated nonsense.",

Simply THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE! I always knew this from the beginning... My opinion has never changed since back in 1995 when I first watched it, I've seen it many many time and never been tired of it. This movie works on so many levels (Plot, script, cast, action sequences) but the main one is the acting of Mel Gibson because HE IS DIRECTING HIMSELF. He knew exactly was he was doing. BRAVISSIMO. Mel's best recitation ( his second is ""The Man Without a Face""). Masterpiece. Excellent. Another great element is the score by James Horner without any doubt his best score ever (his second best is Legend of the falls, then Avatar) and Mel manages to match it perfectly with his images.

This is one of the WORST films about medieval England ever made.  Because of Mel's self-adulation, his enemies must always appear in the worst light, justified or not.  And so we have Mel as William Wallace, in reality a rogue and vagrant, who even the nobles of Scotland would not tolerate, as he was a commoner and beneath their contempt; and we have Edward I, who some historians have dubbed, ""the greatest English King"", and ""the English Justinian"" because he was a lawyer, statesman, soldier, etc.  In other words, a stellar King, and an admired and effective ruler.  But, wait: in Mel's hands, William Wallace (who he conveniently portrays) becomes a democratic model spouting egalitarian principles totally at odds with the England of 1299 and more redolent of America, 1776: and -- BIG SURPRISE -- as Mel's opponent, Edward I is trashed by Patrick McGoohan, who plays the character as a combination of Darth Vader and Heinrich Himmler.  Mel wears the White Hat and his enemies wear the Black Hat - get it??  Some films, like ""Spartacus"" and ""The Lion In Winter"" and ""Glory"" are fairly faithful to history; others, like ""A Man for All Seasons"" and ""Anne of The Thousand Days"" contain nuggets of truth, couched in gorgeous scenery and period costumes.  And then there's, ""Braveheart"" - a film that might fascinate Mel's fans, but which leaves everything to be desired where historical truth is concerned. ""Braveheart"" is the kind of cheesy junk that future generations will term, ""so bad, it's good."" ""Glen or Glenda"" and ""Braveheart"": one hell of a double feature.",

However, that was back in 95 when I was fairly ignorant and just wanted to be entertained. Now, a little older and wiser the main issue I have with this movie is; it is a work of fiction masquerading as fact. You can't search William Wallace on the internet without it making reference to Mel Gibson's character. The movie is littered with blatant one sided inaccuracies; However I'm not going to list them here; many of the reviews have, so read some of them because I don't want to add spoilers. I realize a lot will be thinking I need to lighten up a little and just enjoy it as a movie... but Hollywood, it is NOT your history to be re-writing. How would an American audience react if the British made a movie about Vietnam, or the American Civil war, or the Indian Wars, and then depict all the American inaccurately as lying, murdering, rapists cowards. There wasn't a single honourable Englishman amongst them. As far as I'm concerned this was a missed opportunity to tell the story of William Wallace accurately while still making a great movie. William Wallace is a national hero to some in Scotland so to retell his story inaccurately is an insult to the ancestors of both sides.",
122,1 November 2004,nytemare,9, 9.5/10 - Freeeeeeeeeeeedom!,"Review: This is one of those types of movies which will give you the 'good goosebump' feeling after watching it. It's a typical epic that details a certain hero fighting against all odds for freedom of his/her country. Although the story is pretty typical, its ability to entrance you in it is not. Not many movies are able to accomplish this. Mixed with a powerful musical score (which also won Best Score at Academy Awards for information sake), the movie delivers an amazing experience to viewers satisfying epic lovers, and action seekers. Acting by Mel Gibson is spectacularly superb (he has an edge since he IS partly Scottish). It loses 0.5 points however due to the constant playing of the musical score in some situations which do not seem to fit well with it. What many people complain about is that it is historically inaccurate, I don't remember this movie being brandished with a ""True historical story"" or even a ""Based on a true story"" logo. Watch it for the 'good goosebump' feeling.",

This film was directed by Mel Gibsonn and Wallace was played by Gibson, as well. Gibson did a superb job doing both things at once. I liked the acting in this film because it seemed so realistic. I also liked the score. I believe that it resembles Scottish music. People may not like this film because it is not historically accurate.

131,7 December 2007,vespasian79,1, What a Tartan Horror: A Travesty of Scottish History,"One of these days I'll write some good comments about a decent movie. But not this time, and not this travesty of Scottish History. It was awful. Not from an acting or technical standpoint, I had no objections to the performances or the production values. My criticisms lie with the historical veracity of this overblown, ridiculously distorted epic. Just a few for now. Sir William Wallace was always a 'Sir', he was a baronet, and he was born with that title. He was not a commoner. He was a Scottish Border Lord, and as such made his living by fighting for either the English or the Scots, but only if there was something in it for him. My grandfather, who was born in the Highlands of Scotland, always called him 'Scotland's Pancho Villa', implying that he was a bandit, and my subsequent research has borne this out. Also, he was NOT a Highlander. He probably never wore a kilt or a belted plaid in his life, and definitely not while riding a horse. Try it sometime, riding a horse while wearing a kilt. See how your balls stand up. And the bulk of his army were not Highlanders, unlike the movie, which shows everybody with a claymore to grind against the Poms rushing hither and yon all wearing kilts of Macabre tartan. The evidence - and the Major, me grandfather - are adamant in insisting that Wallace was betrayed on purpose by Robert Bruce, something I have no problem agreeing with, as Bruce founded the Stuart Dynasty, and had more than a suspicion that Wallace wanted the Scottish Crown for himself. The conclusion of the movie shows a grim-looking Robert Bruce and his Army supposedly waiting to pledge their fealty to the English Crown, then spontaneously, just for the hell of it, deciding to attack and start the Battle of Bannockburn. Well, sorry, Mister Randy Wallace. He'd planned that battle for months. It's a pity they didn't show it. On its credit side, Patrick McGoohan's portrayal of Edward I, the Hammer of the Scots, was outstanding, and quite accurate, and the saving grace for this Goebbel's-like celluloid propaganda. ",

Practically every Hollywood film does, including many of the acclaimed ones, even something like 'The Social Network', which apparently played fast and loose with facts that took place less than ten years prior to filming!

The Film has a very black and white morality and the villains are quite one- dimensional. It badly alters history, exaggerating what the British did. The myth of Primae Noctis was established by this film. The chronology is quite poor, Isabella was nine when Wallace died and Edward III was born seven years later. William Wallace committed some atrocities in his fight for 'Freedom' and raided England. You could make a good film out of this by showing the moral dubiousness of his actions, but instead a quite one-sided portrayal is given. Not only does it install bad ideas but it increases a quite negative stereotype of the British. Not all Americans think like this, but such films reinforce the stereotype of them thinking in such basic terms. I feel that this film has often been overrated, even as a film it can be quite poor.

162,24 July 2001,MpCavic,1, Mel Gibson has to be realistic.,"To start off with, this film has many inaccuracies, but since many other users commented on that, I won't spend much time on that.  Rather, one of the major inaccuracies is of Sir William Wallace himself.  Gibson portrays him as a loving, sweet man, when in fact, when you want to free your country from tyranny, you can't have any of those personalities.  You have to kill, not negotiate.  Although William Wallace might have been sweet, he wasn't when he turned into a leader.  Anyways, Robert the Bruce wasn't a traitor, which is very disrespectful of Gibson.  I would suggest that Gibson and Randall Wallace, the idiotic writer, first read a biography of William Wallace called ""William Wallace: Braveheart,"" by James MacKay.  Also, the only good thing about the movie is the acting, not by Gibson but by Patrick McGoohan, Edward I, Sophie Marceau, Queen Isabella and Angus MacFayden, Robert the Bruce.

164,3 March 2014,ironhorse_iv,9," Great Scots! Watch this movie! Every man dies, not every man truly lives to see a great film like this.","Braveheart is one of the best medieval films ever made; but also been described as one of the most historically inaccurate modern films of all time. Directed by Mel Gibson, the film is about a 13th-century Scottish warrior, William Wallace (Mel Gibson). King Edward I AKA 'Longshanks"" (Patrick McGoohan) of England invade Scotland in 1280, murdering many of Scotland's people. Patrick McGoohan is just chilling as Longshanks. What a great performance from him. In the film, Wallace, at first, tries to live a normal life with his childhood friend turn wife, Murron MacClannough (Catherine McCormack), but the horrors of life under Longshank's reign became too much for him. With his fellow Scots, he launched a revenge attacked against the English causing the First War of Scottish Independence. Randall Wallace, the writer of the screenplay, has acknowledged that Blind Harry's 15th century epic poem 'The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie' as a major inspiration for the film. The film takes creative license on the piece, to make the film, more gripping like the like the hanging of Scots nobles at the start of the film or Wallace's getting help from Princess Isabelle of France (Sophie Marceau). I have to say, Sophie Marceau was a great actress for this role. In real life, Isabella was 3 years old and living in France at the time. She was not married to Edward II until he was already king and Edward III was born seven years after Wallace died. This aspect of the plot may however have been inspired by the play, 'Wallace: a triumph in five acts' by Sydney Goodsir Smith, which historically has adult Isabella present at the Battle of Falkirk longing for a real man. Yes, it's a bit historical inaccuracy, but it's brings something to the table that works. Little things complains like the Scots not wearing kilts at the time could be passed over. The belted plaid (feileadh m√≥r l√©ine) was not introduced until the 16th century, 500 years after Wallace's death. Things like Jus Primae Noctis plot that supposedly allows the Lord of a medieval estate to take the virginity of his serf's maiden daughters is still up to historical mystery. Still, there were some historic inaccuracies, I couldn't accept, like the film showing England's occupation and rule of Scotland being much longer. In fact, the English occupation of Scotland was just 2 years old before the battle of Falkirk. Prior to that, the Kingdom of Scotland was separate and fully independent. It was the Scots that gave power to Longshanks when they couldn't decide a king. I will defend the film for the depiction of the Prince of Wales, Edward II (Peter Hanly). His appearance in the film as an effeminate homosexual drew accusations of homophobia against Gibson. In real life, Edward II was believe to be bi-sexual who was very unpopular with his wife, the royals and the people of England. Many historians believe Edward II wasn't gay at all and that it was made up to discredit him. One of the few things, the film go semi-right was the portrayal of Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen). Angus's performance is amazing in the film and my favorite character in the film. Some Scottish people got offended of the negative portrayal of Robert the Bruce whom is more a Scottish hero than Wallace. Even, the title 'Braveheart' is often refers in Scottish history to that of Robert the Bruce, not William Wallace. He got to play second fiddle. Other key figures in the war of Independence was cut out in the film like Bishop William de Lamberton and Andrew de Moray. They were replace by other characters such as Brendan Gleeson as Hamish, and the Irish Steven (David O'Hara). Madman Steven has some of the great one-liners of the film. A lot of Scots might hate the film, due to this misleading history, but in my opinion, a lot of Scots should be thankful because the movie brought a lot to tourists to their country. Some of the English media accused the film of harboring Anglophobia. Yes, because there is going to be a negative portrayal of antagonists in any war film. Doesn't matter if English or not. The action scenes were great. The battle of Stirling was missing the bridge part. The war tactics are not historical right, but it was still well done. It was brutal, bloody, and in close quarters. It's scary to think that men fought this way for years. Even the fake horse dying look real, that even Animal Welfare investigated the film. Gibson toned down the film's battle scenes to avoid an NC-17 rating from the MPAA, with the final version being rated R. Some gory scenes are still disturbing, and disgusting for some viewers. Not a film for any young children. Still, there is some beautiful scenes in the film. I like the way, he shot the landscape even if it's Ireland, not Scotland. Braveheart theme song by James Horner is just beautiful to listen to. It's a very smart film. Then there is the famous quotes that continue to be overplayed whenever, the film comes on such as ""They may take our lives, but they'll never take our FREEDOM!"" The film quote capture the spirit of Celtic heroism. The quote 'Every man dies - Not every man really lives' is from 19th century, American poet, William Wallace, no relation to the William Wallace in the film. I still love it. Overall: it was worthy of winning the Best Picture at the Oscars in 1995. It's still worthy to watch even with today's films.",

182,27 October 2006,general-melchett,9, A top-hole film - Braveheart is medieval epic film-making at its best!,"Braveheart is a truly cracking film - easily the best of 1995. Toy Story may have done better and earn more fame, but this shall always come before it in my mind as the better film - it was actually made for a purpose, and wanted to tell the story of Scotland's greatest medieval hero. Yes, the film does look a bit dated now, and offers no fancy sword-fighting moves or excessive blood, but this helps it stay more realistic, and brings us closer to the action. The two big battle scenes during the film were brilliantly done, and define the word ""epic"" - they were perfectly realistic, yet obviously done on a high budget. There was also some great acting - despite a disappointing, slow start, and it remains to this day as one of the most realistic non-WWII epic movies to this day - no magic dragons or glorious pre-battle speeches - just character and honesty. Braveheart didn't fear about being hated by the English - it tackled the rough subject with honesty and brutality, and made its point perfectly well. Braveheart shall not be forgotten - it was the best thing that happened in Mel Gibson's career (he isn't at his best now), and was the first great sword-and-sandal epic - Jason and the Argonauts was just pathetic. The fact that it looks old now only makes it more realistic - I doubt that there was blood flying like it was out of buckets (Kingdom of Heaven) or hugely melodramatic sound and visual effects (Lord of the Rings) in medieval battle. A truly cracking watch - Braveheart is a film that shall not be forgotten for its character, strong script and originality. A stunning job! 9/10",

184,13 October 2016,cdjh-81125,10, A Masterpiece That Pulls No Punches,"As a proud Scotsman I can easily say that Mel Gibsons Braveheart is without a doubt one of my all time favourite movies and one of my favourite best picture winners. By far the most common compliant I see about this movie is the fact that it isn't very historically accurate, well the film is not a history lecture you can only judge the movie itself and I support any changes they made to this movie from real events as it makes for an extremely compelling story. The story of Braveheart is simple William Wallace (played perfectly by Mel Gibson) leading a rebellion with his fellow Scotsman against England and its King Edward I. It's a story that's impossible not to get behind because it's all about freedom and from fighting for equality. The violence in this movie is bloody and gory but not in an unnecessary way it serves a purpose of truly showing the way in which the battles, rape and torture scenes took place. Mel Gibson took home the Oscar for Best Director for this film and it's very well deserved he knows just how to film the action scenes just right to put the viewer right into their situation, he succeeds just as well in front of the camera as well because I believe that to this day this remains his best performance he knows exactly how to portray Wallace's internal turmoil, unwanted fame, inspiration attitudes and overconfidence. This movie does not paint Wallace as a perfect man there are scenes where he recklessly puts himself and others in danger to settle his personal vendettas and anger and in that regard this movie is very accurate to real life. The late Patrick McGoohan is excellent here as King Edward he strikes just the right balance between imposing menace and brilliant strategist and is always a pleasure to see him on screen. Peter Hanly is also fantastic as Prince Edward because while he does and excellent job at being a hateful character it's really not as simple as that he's got a character character arc to him that shows him feeling unimportant and struggling to cope with failures and living up to his fathers legacy. The scene of Wallaces execution is one of my all time favourite scenes in a movie it is just such a heartbreaking and inspirational scene that never stops giving me chills. Braveheart could have easily be a simple war film but it's got excellent characters with excellent arcs and motivations and succeeds just as well when it comes to the battle sequences delivering some of the best I've ever seen.

Once again the people with no artistic vision only complain about the historical accuracy of the film and to those again I say this. There is NO such thing as historical accuracy of events that took place long ago. Its all either hear-say passed on,or political propaganda. Last time I checked there was no CNN crews hundreds of years ago. There was no video recording of anything as it unfolded. Only documentation written usually long after events happened. And again because the country you happen to live in has a history book that you read as a child you accept it as proof of something. Please give it a rest.. Braveheart was the telling of a incredible story of a ordinary man who helped his nation overcome extraordinary odds.. It was told beautifully and with great passion on the screen.

194,23 February 1999,movieman9,10, Magnificent moviemaking of medieval times; Mel Gibson deserves Oscar!,"Very few film directors can thoroughly entertain us with historical epics. Spielberg and Lean come to mind. Now, Mel Gibson can be added to this prestigious list of names. BRAVEHEART is easily one of the best films of 1995. Watching it, you really get a sense of what movies are all about. I've always thought Mel has had a flair for giving audiences what they want. Even when he was working in Australia, doing such projects as The Bounty and the Mad Max films, I knew there was a creative genius behind those great and under-rated performances. His work in BRAVEHEART is exactly what I had in mind. This is truly a labor of love for Mel, showing real pride in the quality of his craft. I loved the power of this film, emotionally and visually. William Wallace is a savage, but he always represents what he consistently stands to achieve: love, happiness, and most importantly, freedom. You can feel the majesty of the story, weaving Shakespearean edges within it without making it seem like it was made for a privileged few. Patrick McGoohan, who got gipped for an Oscar nod, is brilliant as King Edward, despicable in a collected demeanor. There is even a sense of humour to boot in this epic, bringing a bit of Scottish wit to an intensely serious and bloody carnage of a film. In this regard, I would compare it to Shakespeare. The attention to detail, the emotion, the power of BRAVEHEART prove Mel Gibson definitely has a flair for genius and a gift for entertaining the public. This is not to be missed! Rating: Four stars.",

The actors are all great, up front of course is Mel Gibson himself as William Wallace but there are other great actors in here. For instance (I believe it was) Tommy Flanagan as the crazy Irishman, Angus MacFayden as Robert the Bruce and of course Sophie Marceau as princess Isabelle. Here I really must compliment the casting director or whoever it was who picked these people. The best thing though about the characters is yet, that you feel for them and with them, especially Mel Gibson of course.

217,15 September 2010,tbills2,10, Braveheart is the BEST MOVIE of ALL-TIME!!!,"It's not even close. The directing is A+, Mel Gibson did as perfect of a job as you can do with all the camera-work and cuts, which is really something considering he was the lead role. He also gave an awesome performance as William Wallace. Saying Braveheart is historically inaccurate is nonsense, really; the true life of Wallace has nothing to do with this movie. That is not that hard a concept. When critiquing Braveheart I find two very minor flaws - Gibson's accent isn't the greatest, but, he's not Scottish, so I don't see that as significant, and the extras in the war scenes just suck in some scenes. You can see if you look closely that all of the combat does not appear authentic. These are the only two faults I can find, and they are rather trivial. Everything else works. The story of Braveheart is as epic as it gets, man loses true love, gets revenge on the entire country responsible and frees his homeland and its people in the process. It's presented in exquisite fashion. The pace of Braveheart is impeccable. The love scenes in the beginning in no way are sluggish. They serve as the calm before the storm. The writing is excellent in these scenes, as are the interactions between Wallace and Murron. The love story really jumps forward quickly, and you are soon thrust into warfare. Braveheart is not excessively violent. The gory moments serve their purpose and are not overstated. The overall writing of the movie is very smart. There are no unnatural moments or lines for any characters. The characters are all well portrayed. The acting is subtle and very polished. Patrick McGoohan as Longshanks was outstanding. The cinematography of Braveheart is as good as it gets; it might stand alone as the best ever in this area. The visuals are epic. The music is epic. The score of Braveheart is so, so strong. It continually adds to the viewing experience throughout. The ending of Braveheart is easily the best of any film. Braveheart gives you all the emotions you could ask for and does a great job of mixing light-hearted moments within all the serious drama. No other movie matches the 'epicness' and beauty of Braveheart, thus, making it the greatest movie of all-time! Bow to Mel Gibson.",

Man has fought on one battlefield or another and in one arena after another in an effort to rid himself of the shackles that bind him, and he has always paid a dear price for that freedom.  `Braveheart,' directed by and starring Mel Gibson, is the story of one man who would not abide the despotic rule of an unworthy sovereign, and took a stand against it.  A 13th Century commoner and a patriot who loved his country, Scotland, William Wallace (Gibson) burned with an unquenchable desire to be free of the British, who had murdered his father when William was just a boy.  Raised by kin, Wallace nevertheless grew up wanting only to marry, work his farm and raise a family.  But circumstances dictated otherwise, and without knowing what they had unleashed, the British rekindled that fire that burned within the boy, and Wallace soon left his mark on the Monarchy of King Edward I of England.",

The scenes of the Battle of the Stirling and the Battle of Falkirk, were amazing and the cinematography is absolutely amazing. The scenes are brutal and barbaric, but the violence supports the story-the want of freedom from the evil rules of the King. Edward the Longshanks is an evil king who is a seriously corrupted person in the movie, but the acting is really great.

The only weak link is the length, which bogs down the film.  A good scrip, but they could cut 20 minutes out of this film.  Mel Gibson, will be remembered as a great actor. I believe he has yet to perform his best work, and will act in many more successful roles.

Too old to remember what I once knew of Scottish history, and therefore entirely unaware of any historical inaccuracies which I've since heard others put forth, I saw only a long, lush, romantic, dramatic, cinematic war poem, the sort of thing that would have become required reading in English literature courses had it been created by a troubador a few centuries earlier.  It didn't even bother me that Mel Gibson, despite his usual exceptionally strong acting, was far too old for the hero's role.  I was enchanted and deeply moved.",

""Braveheart"" is also an explosive action movie. The logical comparison is not with the pallid ""Rob Roy"" but with a ""Die Hard"" film.

One last thing..all, and I mean ALL ,of the performances are SUPERB. I found Angus McFadyens Bruce to be especially moving. In a sense, the film is about his moral and political education( another echo  of Chimes at Midnight). In short, a magnificent film..I would give it a 9.65.",

To begin with, the movie was unduly long; so long that as soon as the first half ended,I thought the movie was over !! And during the next half, I had my most boring hour at the theater. However, to my great relief, the movie ended after about an hour. My boredom is on account of the slow flow of the events and the lack of interest and excitement in most of the scenes ( more than half of the movie ).In fact, Gibson should have placed more emphasis on the crucial events which were supposed to be a milestone in different periods of the life of William Wallace. Unfortunately, Gibson did not seem to have given the enough expression to those crucial events; that's why , most of the time, the movie was monotonous except the spectacular war scenes, which were- I think- the greatest accomplishment of Mel Gibson as a director; not an actor. The breathtaking war scenes could not prevent the dullness of the movie, though.",

Do you see the president out in the battlefield now in days? Yet the Kings of the country were out in the battlefield giving commands, standing there for their country, whether it's in ruins or ruling. The tragedy in this movie is so sad, it makes you want to jump in and fight next to Wallace and do your best to support the inhumanity that's delivered from all those who put them through so much. How could anything have ever gotten this out of control? Well this is one of my favorite movies, if not my favorite. The soundtrack is simply powerful and so very lovely.

I can't believe that some people like son of the mask or babie genieuses (which both happen to be on the bottom 100 list) over this.

286,30 August 1999,the rock-17,10, what a great movie,"If there was such a thing as a perfect film, this would be it.  This 1995 Academy Award Winning film had everything any film lover could ask for: action, adventure, drama, romance........even a little speck of comedy here and there.  Mel Gibson didn't an excellent job of directing this movie and playing the hero, William Wallace.  This extremely violent tale tells the story of the wars between the English and the Scottish.  After one Scottish man (guess who?  Yes, Mr. Wallace) has had enough and decides to fight back, his wife is murdered.  Seeking revenge, he starts an army to fight against their enemies and lead a nation.  I could not praise this movie enough.  I admit that I like violence, and this had that.  It was a very graphic movie that showed beheadings and all sorts of barbaric violence.  You fell in love with all of the characters, especially William Wallace.  I have never seen a better movie that tells the tale of such a heroic person like William Wallace.  In the scene where he is riding back and forth on his horse, dressed in blue paint, talking to all of the Scottish people ready to leave, announcing that he is William Wallace.........you can't help but be proud of him.

Then we come to the story......""I know"" someone said, ""lets take a factual story and rewrite it so that not one single fact remains"". Why?? I've never understood the Scottish fascination with Wallace - he was a useless commander who won one battle in his life by ignoring the code of chivalry and attacking while the English crossed Stirling Bridge and then spent the rest of his life hiding from the English and leading his band of cut-throats over the border to destroy undefended farms and villages. His next biggest victory after Stirling Bridge was against an English Nunnery where he raped all the nuns and killed all their goats and sheep. Not in the film? I wonder why. Eventually even his Scottish supporters got so peed off with him they deliberately shopped him to the English.",

294,9 January 2012,stuart-halliday,4, Hollywood History,"Having watched this film for the first time (we had some Scots friends staying and they wanted me to see it) I have to say that I was not especially impressed. Having read some reviews calling it the greatest film ever, I was surprised by how inadequate it was in terms of the production. The battle scenes gave full opportunity for Mel to vent his hatred of the English in graphic form (I bet he wished the swords were real!) but I still found it largely lacking in both sentiment and reality. Oh, I know we complainants are constantly exhorted to look on this as a film (i.e as a fantasy and not as a documentary etc), but I'm afraid can't, entirely. There is a strong political subtext and message in this film which does have modern implications for people in the UK. For these reasons alone, we do need to take it seriously. I think the effect that the movie has had on people, especially as regards the liberties taken with historical characters, concerned me a lot more than the film itself. The opinions appearing in some of the reviews reinforced my worries.I was really concerned by the way people seem to have established very fixed opinions about events and characters of which they admittedly know little, apart from the information they are given in the course of this film. This is totally bizarre. History seems to be the only academic discipline in which this occurs and which is accordingly trivialised to such an extent. Few people would take such liberties with a topic involving other subjects - Science or medicine,for example. Some of the opinions about Edward I, for instance, are quite extreme - 'epitomy of evil','monster' 'tyrant' etc. Don't you think people should maybe do a bit of further reading before applying such epithets? Edward I deserves better than this pathetic bit of character assassination. He was a strong medieval King -intelligent, personally brave, ruthless, learned, pious and a positive and faithful husband (both his wives absolutely adored him). Like most people, his character was a mixture. Most of his successful counterparts, Phillip IV of France and Robert I (the Bruce) of Scotland were equally determined and certainly just as cruel when the need arose. If we're talking about more recent comparisons I think Abraham Lincoln might well fit the bill. Lincoln was basically a good man, but was driven to extremes by the political position in which he found himself. Like Edward I he was equally determined to protect his country by the establishment (or re-establishment) of a state of union, and definitely was, despite his wit and geniality, equally ruthless in achieving what he saw as necessary for the good of his country. I do realise that this is a film and that films need heroes and villains. That's fine as long as they are mythical villains such as Lex Luthor or the Riddler; my point is that if you want to assess a proper historical character, and publicise those assumptions on a public forum, maybe you should do a bit of background reading and not base your opinion entirely on a highly biased, third-rate Hollywood epic",
295,16 June 2007,glenxxvi,10, one of the greatest epics ever made,"i must say that i am very surprised to find that this film is currently ranked no. 96 on IMDb and that it gets 8.3 out of 10. i think that this film deserves at least 9 out of 10. and ranked 96, is that all it gets? it should at least be in the top ten, i don't know if it's the best film ever made but it's certainly up there with the best. this film has everything, the music score is great, the actors are great (some of them i've never even heard of before and never seen since, but they're good anyway) and the story is extremely well done, even if it is historically inaccurate. the film is so good that the three hours go by ever so quickly and the fight scenes are good and bloody, normally fight scenes in other films are boring and/or hard to follow but this isn't. what's really good is the battle of wits between king edward (longshanks) and william wallace. it's almost like a game of chess on film, wallace controls the Scottish and the king controls the English and what's really amazing is the sense that without their leaders each country would be lost, as longshanks says' they're sheep, merely sheep, easily dispersed if we strike the shepard.' i could be here all day just telling you why this film is so good but if you've already seen it then you already know, if not then get it because you will keep it, trust me. i haven't seen mel Gibson's latest work, apocolpyto but if it's half as good as this then it will be excellent.",
296,2 March 2008,Sternicus,9, Mel Gibson you magnificent bastard!,"That was great! It's so refreshing to see a genuine portrayal of medieval life without the sugar coating given by other low budget film's that mislead the viewer into thinking that people back then had more of a sense of honor and duty than they do now. This film gets a lot of unnecessary flack from people due to it's violent content, but THATS HOW LIFE WAS BACK THEN! Mel exposes this in a expert and dynamic way. As a director Mel Gibson is nothing shorter then amazing. During the battles you feel as though this is a first hand documentary account dropped on a real life battle. And it's real! There is no CGI. That big army was made up of thousands of extras. It wasn't a cartoon with digital effects running rampant. It's genuine. When it's raining that's not a rain machine. Mel was wise enough to recognize that it would be better to shoot the scene's in the rain if and when it did rain, to give it that authentic look. If the characters were mint clean in ever shot like Orlando Bloom was in The Lord of The Rings that would have looked phony. Mel pulls very few punches except in the scene of William Wallaces execution that doesn't even show the disembowelment. A show of restraint by Mel. However at one point there is hardly even one scene that can go without someone getting killed. In one of those scene's the English kings throws an unsuspecting man out a window just for simply showing confidence, and submitting his advice. There have been few movies I've seen recently where I truly despised a character and was routing for them to get their punishment but BraveHeart does just that in creating a truly despicable character in the British king. The king would later die a much simpler death than the ones he gave other people. Back then if you were a sociopath with power you got away with murder. The royalty had little respect for the life of people they found inferior. The peasants were mere pawns to them. There is one moving scene in which a prince in a moment of self realization is brought to tears by his past actions, in which he tells his father; ""Those men who fight for me, fight cause if they don't I'll starve their wives, and burn their homes."" (That quote may not be exact.) After which he boldly states; ""I will not be on the wrong side again!"", choosing a soul over depravity. This was not a wicked film drunk on blood and gore, it had a true heart, but there are still people who refuse to see that. There are already plenty of watered down swordfests for you squeamish types stinking up video stores like The Golden Compass or Lord of The Rings. However if you want to see something genuine watch this you'll be amazed.",

To all my ""fellow Scots"" who seem to think this film defines our supposed ""struggle"" against English ""oppression"" should realise that it is actually about Mel Gibson's personal anti-English vendetta. I do believe in an independent Scotland, but I feel that this film is more of a hindrance than a help to this cause, because it makes it easy to label those of us who hold this belief as racist idiots. Anyway, the way I see it, the ""bad guys"" if you look at the history of this period is that the English aren't necessarily our enemies, it's the feudal lords of Britain in general. Why is it that this film hasn't caused a class war? I'm getting off the subject anyway. My advice to all these people who say this movie is ""inspiring"" and scream ""freedom"", no doubt while wearing a Jimmy hat, is that they should get off their fat arses and do something about gaining independence for Scotland, if they truly believe in it. Otherwise, shut up about it being such an inspiration.",

It remains one of the handful of movies that he will watch over and over again. You're exactly right, the violence is necessary, it only makes the movie more powerful and the hardships that the Scotch had to endure while fighting for their independence hit home that much more.

309,1 December 2016,stevehoyland,3, Historical fantasy.,"As a dramatic fairy-tale - for those of us who like action movies and rooting for the underdog - Braveheart Is watchable and entertaining. But there It ends. Where a budget of ¬£75M went(compare to the relatively tiny ¬£3M budget of the Infinitely better ""Rob Roy"")one can only surmise but It certainly wasn't spent on Historical study. The fact that Mel Gibson takes the part of William Wallace(who was a ""real"" person) gives the clear and Intentional Implication that this Is a true story - It Is not, and If the main character had been ""Just some brave Scot"" I could stomach It - but real people and real events have been Interwoven with a fantasy with some of the grossest anti-English sentiment I have ever witnessed In a film. The production team couldn't even get the man-skirts correct(The Kilt was Invented four centuries later by Englishman Thomas Rawlinson In Lancashire In 1720)and the ""head-In-a-basket"", the ""princes-boyfriend-thrown-to-his-death"" and multiple other scenes are pure fantasy as Is the age of the homosexual prince's French bride (she was aged 9 when married - not that the marriage would ever have been consummated whatever her age!). The clear Indication that all Englishmen were cowardly scumbags while all Scots were thoroughly decent heroes pervades the whole movie and on a personal note I find this offensive and racist as do many of my movie-loving peers. However, I'm happy for those who will no doubt enjoy It - as long as they realise that the only true fact this movie contains Is the names of some of the people.",

311,9 May 1999,Osiris-11,10, An achievement in storytelling.,"This film is perhaps one of the most entertaining stories that Hollywood has produced to date.  It is of course completely historically inaccurate, though it is certainly not the only, nor the most recent, film to obscure historical truths and still be impressively well done.  Gibson does nothing new with this movie, as it is a classic blend of adventure, romance, morality, and comic relief.  What Gibson does do, however, is weave these aspects together with greater skill than most.  To compare this story to history is futile, as is comparing the Bard's tale of Julius Caesar to the actual occurrences in ancient Rome.  While based on historical events the purpose of this and any movie is to entertain.  Education, while a good and noble purpose, is not nor should it be the primary goal of the cinema. While Braveheart will not educate as to the events in medieval Scotland, it will indeed tell a tale that has been told the world over in a million variations.  Some call Braveheart laughable and trite and in some respects these critics are not wrong.  My counter to this argument is that all epics, from The Odyssey to Beowulf to the Lord of the Rings, are by nature laughable and trite.  The story of William Wallace as presented by Braveheart is not the story of the man who lived in Scotland centuries ago but the story of every epic hero.  As an epic, the story must invariably deal with and contain archetypes so broadly ranging that they must be described as laughable and trite.  That Braveheart is a very basic story, which I will admit, by no means qualifies it as a bad story.  Instead it is an epic story, and a very good one at that.",

It's really a classic revenge tale but it turns into so much more. Everything is amazing. Battle scenes still hold up today but for the time they were amazing. The acting is amazing by everyone involved. Mel Gibson's character (William Wallace) has a scene where he's betrayed and his expressions are for sure the example of the best non verbal acting I've ever seen. The guy who plays Robert The Bruce nails it in response as well. Powerful all the way around. The music adds something too from the get go. Even the child actors were pretty good.

Set in 14th Century Scotland, William Wallace (Gibson) was living a peaceful life with new wife Murron (Catherine McCormack), until she is killed by the soldiers, so he leads a rebel army to fight for the freedom of his country. They may be slightly outnumbered against the armies of the sneering King Edward I (Patrick McGoohan), but they manage to win the battles they encounter. Wallace becomes a name to be reckoned with, and he also forms a bond with Princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau). But Wallace is captured when he is betrayed by Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen), and he faces a slow and painful death when he refuses to beg for mercy, and before beheaded, his last noble word is ""Freedom!"" The army of Scotland, and Ireland, continue the fight in his honour, and they won their freedom. Also starring Brendan Gleeson as Hamish, James Cosmo as Campbell, David O'Hara as Stephen, Ian Bannen as Leper, Peter Hanly as Prince Edward, Sean Lawlor as Malcom Wallace, Brian Cox as Argyle Wallace and Alun Armstrong as Mornay. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Makeup and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for James Horner, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Sound, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Make Up/Hair and Best Production Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. Mel Gibson was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the ending, it was number 91 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 13 on The 100 Greatest War Films, and it was number 62 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers.

Then I turned ten and realised that it was a cinematic piece of crap. The accents are so bad by every single actor that I cant help but cringe my arse off (you know that really bad kind of cringe like when you remember farting extremely loudly in a job interview). The fact that the whole thing was filmed in Ireland with Irish actors was also a rather big factor in sealing this movie the 'Worst Scattish movie based on Scattish people but made by Americans' title. For a start the film was based on a POEM. Randall couldn't have just researched a few separate history books and built up a decent picture of what really happened. Too easy. He based it on a poem written by a guy called Blind Harry two decades after the events happened. Completely logical. You know what I can see why people like it. Its got romance, adventure, violence. I would be fine with that if (stupid) people didn't take this as complete historic proof that Wallace was an all round hero. He wasn't. He raped and murdered his way to the top. Fair enough he did fight for Scotlands independence, but where has that really got us? Were still part of the UK being controlled by England so the whole revolutionary tale in the movie is balls. I don't get why an American or Australian would make this movie. Surely their countries cant be so dry of culture that they have to start stealing other peoples? I know every one says their 'half scatch' or 'three quarters Irish' but their just kidding themselves. Leave the Scottish movies to the Scots. After all I'm sure the yanks wouldn't like us making a movie about their own war of independence filmed in Canada starring New Zealanders eh?",

Wallace (portrayed by Mel Gibson) is a heroic figure in this. As a viewer you have no choice but to admire him for his courage and his fierce devotion to Scotland, and for his ability to rally the Scots around him. He certainly comes across as more consistently devoted to Scotland's freedom than, for example, Robert the Bruce (Angus MacFadyen) - which, in truth, he was. The title misleads, however.

Reading the reviews, the many American reviewers seem to believe it as an accurate representation. It isn't. It takes more liberties that a Walter Scott novel The acting is also very mixed. The Irish accent of the actor playing the father of Wallace shines through for instance, and Gibson's attempt as a Scottish accent is almost on a par with Dick van Dyke in Mary Poppins. Beautifully filmed with some fine performances (eg Brian Cox) it also has a haunting score, and it has entered movie history with so many of its effects and sayings entering popular culture, like Scots sports fans painting their faces blue. But it is tosh. Hardly any of it happened, the time line is way out and Gibson is far to short to play Wallace who was a giant of a man. For me, the reaction of Americans who constantly seek imaginary roots only goes to prove that as a nation they are on the dimmer side of average.

361,2 March 2017,leacraignou,8, It was a really good movie but with a lot of inaccuracies,"i liked watching Braveheart, it was a good movie. It has a beautiful story and great landscapes of Scotland. I really liked it because there was a lot of action. I did appreciate the battle scenes between the Scottish and the English. Moreover I think that's a beautiful way of thinking as William Wallace did, the vengeance for Murron and fighting for freedom and die young instead of dying old in your farm. It teaches us a certain way old life. But with hindsight there have a lot of inaccurate facts. The first is simple, it's about Scots' clothes, at this time they didn't wear kilts and tartans as they do in the film. Secondly the love between William and Elisabeth of France is just impossible because she was only four years old when Wallace came to France and even if he asked to see her, he couldn't. For all these reason I admit that Braveheart was a great film with a good story and battle scenes so congratulation to Mel Gibson.

The story as told by modern writers, began when Wallace takes up the challenge of the English invaders on their own terms. This fine film called ""Brave heart "" is an excellent rendition of the basic facts of the legacy. Although there are many disputed events, the final outcome was nothing short of complete freedom from English tyranny. Mel Gibson plays the Scottish hero William Wallace and does a commanding effort and furthermore he directs the dramatic epic as well. In his superb cast are Hollywood veterans like Brian Cox, Patrick McGoohan, Angus Macfadyen as Robert the Bruce and Alun Armstrong. The lasting impression one gets from this movie are the vicious, slaughter-house re-enactments of the most brutal battle scenes in Scottish history.

Mel Gibson's portrayal of this warrior was next to perfect, he showed savagery, compassion, love, and hatred, all key elements held by any true Scot. During the fight scenes, he showed the heart of a warrior, and in the many love scenes, showed his deep and everlasting adoration for his deceased bride. During the opening of the Battle of Stirling, Mel gave the speech that would set in place the standards for many movies to come, including Aragorn's speech before the Battle of the Black Gate in LOTR: The Return of the King (this only includes the actors actions, as it is obvious that this speech was already told in J.R.R. Tolkeins book). The true brilliance of this movie ends with the remarkable and heartbreaking torture and then execution by means of beheading of Wallace, and then the narrator telling the prologue with scenes of Robert the Bruces army preparing for the final battle against the English, that would result in Scotlands freedom from British rule. The final scene shows Campbell (Brendan Gleeson) hurling the legendary Wallace claymore into the battlefield, sticking into the soil, representing the separation of Scotland from England, and an eternal reminder of the great deeds William Wallace did for his country and his people.",

It is the heroic tale of how a Scottish commoner rebelled against an English tyrant. With a grand canvas, absolute stunning cinematography, a water tight screenplay, very well acted and above all directed with such a passion and courage that you want this tale not to end at all even after the three hours of running time. After an emotional twist in the tale, the movie goes to a very high level of film making in unforgettable last hour of it. It's Mel Gibson's show from start to finish as he acts and directs with full love and understanding of cinema. The war scenes are detailed, uncluttered and mesmerizing. Sophie Marceau as English queen looks beautiful and acts smartly. The camaraderie among Scottish rebels is charming and provides the comic relief. Just like Gladiator, Braveheart is the heroic tale worth revisiting again and again and again.",
388,21 June 2015,goreilly40,6, Historically inaccurate but its not a documentary,"As a history lover I found elements of the plot simply absurd. As said before it couldn't have been more inaccurate if Wallace had ordered in the heavy artillery or sent in the air strikes. Historically it was a nonsense and probably one of the most inaccurate movies I've ever seen. The story seems to be hand picked from various periods of history and mixed together to make what can only be described as a curious hybrid time piece. That said however this is a movie whose main aim was to entertain the viewing audience, not an educational documentary, and it succeeded in its aim. The acting was good, the battle scenes were brutal, memorable and exciting, the antagonist was conniving ruthless and cunning, all must have qualities for any villain, and the protagonist was brave, noble and charismatic, the plot itself wasn't overly complex and captivating enough to see the movie through to the end, it spawned a number of memorable quotes and the ending was very moving. So by all means watch this movie as it is entertaining, but don't take it as an accurate portrayal of the actual historical figures and events its based on.",

390,23 September 2020,lyubitelfilmov,10, How the Scots expelled the English or the history of the national hero William Wallace,"Historical drama. The picture of my childhood, which I stared at as soon as possible, because the ""box"" did not always show it. Nevertheless, I remembered it well, and revisited it many times in the following years. And the last time (before this review) I reviewed it when I was ill in the twelfth or thirteenth year, I don't remember exactly, it was a long time ago. This is a masterpiece, and here's my quick opinion - William is fighting for the freedom of Scotland. But, since the picture was not without its drawbacks, I will also mention them, but before that I will go over the advantages of this epic historical drama.
So the pros:
1. The story of William Wallace - the film tells about the Scottish national hero, who led a popular uprising against the English king in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. He and his brave warriors won a number of brilliant victories, were able to defeat several English armies, liberated Scotland and even were able to deliver a powerful blow to England itself on her soil, which became a powerful impetus for the unification of the scattered Scottish clans, and in the end, after a long war and a series of bloody battles, they were able to achieve freedom and independence of the Scottish kingdom (although not for a very long time), although William Wallace himself did not see this. Like Razin and Pugachev - he was betrayed and subjected to a cruel execution. Mel Gibson, the performer of the role of William and the director of this masterpiece, showed his hero as a courageous, brave, uncompromising, skillful warrior, an idealistic romantic who strives for freedom not for his own sake, but for the sake of all Scots. And the Scots are brave, because they are the descendants of the Picts - a fierce tribe that stopped the Roman army at one time. The bravery of the Scots plus the intelligence and knowledge of William were the keys to success. The life of William is vividly shown, from boy to leader of the army. Victories and defeats, drama and so on. Screenwriter Randall Wallace (interesting coincidence) worked on the main character and everything else. There are claims, but we will talk about them below. In general, if you do not go into details, the script is good. And it is precisely the exciting and dramatic story that I remember this picture even in those years when I was small.
2. Camera work - the views of Scotland are fascinating even now, the cameraman in the battle scenes snatches out the brightest and most juicy shots from which you can not take your eyes off.
3. Music - James Horner, composer of this masterpiece, has done a great job. In the film, the national melodies of Scotland played on the bagpipes sound, the battle scenes sound suitable music, in the dramatic scenes the viewer literally feels the tension on himself.
4. Battles - the picture shows several key battles of William, where he showed his gift of leadership. The extras were more than enough for the viewer to believe that we are facing a battle, and not a bunch of reenactors - amateurs in the amount of ten people plus one dog beaten by a moth. Blood, cruelty, screams of the wounded, dismembered - everything is present in the right amount and without brute force, so that the viewer believes in what is happening on the screen.
5. Dramaticism - many dramatic scenes that are well staged and well played, especially since Mel Gibson has collected many famous actors who do not need a long explanation of what is required of them. For especially sensitive viewers, these moments can even cause tears.
So the cons:
1. Historical mistakes - many of them, starting with the very personality of William. In the picture, he is shown as a commoner, who, with his perseverance and bravery, received the title of knight and became regent of Scotland, in fact, he was from the nobility, though not very rich, for which the rest of the nobility hated him. The battles are shown spectacularly and dramatically, but key elements have been omitted. Weapons that the insurgents did not yet use, the famous kilts, which did not exist then. A romantic line, which in reality could not have been, William's betrayal, the death of Edward Long-leg, and so on. If you are interested, you can study historical materials. Randall Wallace did a good job on the script, omitting and throwing out only a few facts from the real chronicle of William, it's true. Any historical picture is guilty of this, and this one is no exception. Do not think wrong, I liked the script, how accents are placed, the pettiness and betrayal of the nobility, love for the country, relations between the nobility and commoners, symbolism, the insignificance of the power and legacy of the monarch, but there are many mistakes in the picture, and you cannot completely trust it, and teach history - especially. Mel Gibson shot a masterpiece about courage, selfless devotion to his home, his country.
2. Modernized dialogues - heroes, especially Scots, speak a modern language that is understandable to a common viewer. Sorry, but I don't believe that. At that time they did not speak like that, and did not use modern turns of speech.
A little about the main characters:
1. William Wallace performed by Mel Gibson is an ordinary Scotsman, in whose life a terrible tragedy happened, in which the British were guilty, which gave impetus for the hero to become the leader of the uprising. An educated and brave warrior who managed to unite the proud and rebellious Scots to fight the British and win freedom from English tyranny. The hero of Mel was brave to the very end, who believed with his goal and dreams, who had to endure inhuman torment for his beliefs, God forbid everyone to go through this. Mel's Best Actor, No Compromise!
2. Edward the First ""Long Legs"" performed by Patrick McGuen - the king of England and Scotland, ruling the country with a tough hand. An experienced politician and commander who intends to punish the impudent William using all available means. A cunning and cynical king who has his own problems, and who does not have too much time to solve them. Patrick's charisma and gaze assure the viewer that we have a king in front of us, who better not cross the road. Bravo Patrick!
3. Princess Isabella played by Sophie Marceau is the wife of the heir to the English throne, who is to play a very important role in the fate of William and all those close to them. Shows himself as a brave diplomat. Not without romance, you know. And the actress herself is very beautiful, and she coped with the role. Well done!
Also noted was Brendan Gleeson in the role of the big red-haired warrior and James Cosmo (Geor Mormont from ""Game of Thrones"").
The best directorial work by Mel Gibson became a real classic of historical cinema, despite many mistakes, received five Oscars (then it was still prestigious and honorable), collected the box office and became loved all over the world, including in Russia. Second on my list of favorite historical paintings, with Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" ranked first.
As a result, we have a masterpiece historical drama about the national hero of Scotland, William Wallis, with a good script, excellent music and camera work, large-scale battles and excellent acting.",

A lot of endearing authenticity is also thanks to great acting and costume designs as well. It's hard to find a war film that's so focused and emotionally driven as this one. The only flaw I have is that there's a love scenario that develops towards the end of the movie that's totally unnecessary and even takes away from some other emotional tendencies that occur earlier in the film. But it's hard not to get swept up in the grand spectacle that's known as a masterpiece. This is one that shouldn't be missed.",

When I offered it as one of the most romantic films I had ever seen, several people scoffed, commenting on how much death and gore there was and how could that possibly be viewed as being romantic.  True, the battles are horrific, hundreds, thousands, of men butchering each other in close quarter hand to hand combat.  There is decapitation, dismemberment, and rivers of blood and death.  Yet it is also the story of the power of commitment.  In the story (how true this is I can not say, but the theme works anyway) William Wallace gave up his life, gave himself entirely to free his country.  Nothing else mattered.  There is no cautions planning, no careful conservation of resource.",

Love a woman so much that it hurts too lose her like nothing experienced before. To know the feeling of being betrayed by those you trusted!

Visually, it was fine for the most part, but this film is great evidence of how seeing something good is not equal to feeling something good. The story was not particularly interesting, but maybe the reason is also that this era in history was never among my favorite ones.

""Braveheart"" is a very simplistic epic and highly inaccurate historically and it's not on par with some of its influences, but I will say this: it is a truly exciting and delightful film and I was not bored with a single moment of it.

436,26 July 2020,schroederagustavo,9, Freedom!,"A really good movie with awesome, legendary large-scale battle scenes. I just watched this film for the first time and realized how much The BoB from Game of Thrones was inspired by Braveheart. And the battle sequences truly are amazing, brutal and gory. One thing I appreciate about the movie is Gibson knows exactly when to hold back with the graphic violence and when to show it. The battle sequences really show the brutality of medieval warfare, as it should, because it proves the point of how much these men had to lose and what they were willing to sacrifice for freedom. But for example, when they kill William Wallace's girlfriend they don't show it, and good because I think the message is delivered quite effectively anyway. The same goes for the final torture scene in the film. From a technical standpoint, the battle sequences are a real feat of film making and even though we're talking about probably hundreds of extras, it's never really confusing and you can really get a good sense of what's happening at all times. I will say that I like Mel Gibson in the role, but after seeing him in so much stuff throughout the years, it felt a little weird seeing him with the long hair and the Scottish accent, although he really pulls it off and is for the most part good as William Wallace. There were a few scenes here and there were I felt his acting was a little on the exaggerated side of things, a little hammy. And it does feel a little egocentric to be in the leading role of his own three hour epic, although he's good in it. The one performance I didn't love was Angus Macfadyen, I thought he was really hammy in it, but the rest of the cast is good. The movie also has some great cinematography by John Toll and the score by James Horner is legendary. It's really good and I would even say it's a must-watch film!",

It's all the more incredible because there's no use of CGI during the battle scenes. It's all natural and as real as possible with wonderful use of jump cuts for startling effect.

I've read all of the scathing reviews concerning Mel Gibson hating England and rewriting history. Well Mel didn't write the story. He simply brought it to life on screen and did a fine job as an actor and director. You have to take the story with a pinch of salt. It's a romanticised version of history as was Pearl Harbor (also written by Randall Wallace). The opening lines of the film are 'I shall tell you of William Wallace. Historians from England will say I am a liar, but history is written by those who have hanged heroes'. I guess the writer is trying to suggest that this film is the legend of Wallace passed down by the Scots as opposed to the history recorded by the English.

Mr Gibson has always been one of my favorite actors, but his greatest success by far was in the production and direction of this SUPERB movie. Although the movie itself is almost 3 hours long, it is totally absorbing from beginning to end. I first saw this film as a special preview, and had to take the very last seat in the cinema, which of course was the worst possible one. The film was just so amazing that I didn't move a muscle for the entire film, even though I was sat at a very uncomfortable angle. The 3 hours seemed to fly by, so much so that I was late for an appointment, as I just hadn't realised how long the film was, and I never checked my watch once. Everything about this movie deserves the highest praise indeed, including Mr Gibson's Scottish accent.

451,25 May 2020,maue-19674,4, A slice of Hollywood Medieval Fantasy - but Historically it's a disaster,"Sometimes you can look forward to a Film because it purports to be about a famous Historical Figure/time or Place. Mel Gibson's 'Braveheart' is a great piece of Film-making - but it is total FICTION as History. So much of the Film has been crafted towards a Hollywood action movie that it may as well have not bothered with accuracies. Gibson has tried the well known fob-offs but, lets face it, he couldn't be bothered to do a SERIOUS Film about the subject matter. The fact that it is an extremely well made production - with a tremendous score by the late James Horner are things in its favour.
But, for me, so much of it was just wrong for the sake of 'stereotyping' - the Scots MUST have all worn kilts because Americans would identify with them (wrong of course - too early for kilts), the battles are not that accurate - Stirling Bridge, Falkirk and even Bannockburn - they were simply NOT fought that way. Edward I - wouldn't be so stupid as to order his archers to fire into a packed melee (another fabrication.) In reality it was Edward's archers who helped win the Battle of Falkirk against Wallace! Even Robert The Bruce gets the 'Gibson' treatment and comes out as a flawed patriot...There are lots more complete lies and fabrications - mostly to reinforce the 'Hollywood Wallace' and the 'Pantomime English' - again for American audiences.
This WAS an absolutely crucial time for the Scottish nation - under siege by one of the most formidable Medieval Monarchs and suffering in-fighting among it's own leaders, they had to survive until they could strike a decisive blow - a story that deserved to be told properly. Instead, what we have here is 'Hollywood Action Pick' fodder. It does NOT do justice to the man, the times or what was at stake..",

This film leaves you with a distaste for what the English did to the Scots, but also a feel good feeling when the Scots win a battle.

And that his dream was not fought in vain . Because it lived on in the hearts of his men. With the same conviction and passion he had , that is why I love this movie!

456,7 September 2009,Gunn,10," Emotional, Stunning, Brilliant Masterpiece!","I can't believe I haven't reviewed this, my co-favorite (with Dances with Wolves), No. 1 film that I've ever seen. I just couldn't pick between the two. Both films move me emotionally in similar ways. Mel Gibson's masterpiece actually affected/inspired the vote for Scotland's devolution. It gave the Scottish people a strong sense of pride in their heritage, something they seemed to lack when it came to voting for independence. Anyone who knows a bit of Scottish history knows that the film contains many inaccuracies, but this story is based on a poem by Blind Harry and little is known of William Wallace outside of that. The basic story plot is true. The murder of his wife definitely drove him to act against the English tyranny of Edward the 1st (Longshanks). Certain details are off, as the Battle of Stirling was fought on a bridge over marshlands, the romance between Wallace and the princess never happened as she was a mere child when Wallace died. Kilts are also questionable as they were not worn commonly at that time. Yet the story of William Wallace is legend. He beat the English against incredible odds, as he had much fewer men. He united a divided Scotland to fight for Freedom. He inspired Robert the Bruce to act for Scotland and not the throne. Gibson tells the story brilliantly with the help of cinematographer John Toll, who brilliantly captures Scotland's rugged, rustic beauty, and a fine cast of actors led by himself, Angus Macfadyen, Patrick McGoohan, Brendan Gleeson, James Cosmo, Brian Cox, Ian Bannen, Tommy Flannagan and the gorgeous ladies, Catherine McCormack and Sophie Marceau. His use of symbolism is excellent. I especially liked his use of the thistle, which is the Flower of Scotland, its main symbol along with the Saltire or St. Andrew's Cross which is on Scotland's flag. In the film, Wallace has saved the thistle Murron gave him as a child and he gives it to her as a gift of love. She in turn embroiders a thistle on a cloth which she gives to him at their wedding and this gift becomes even more of a symbol. Also, the blue warpaint that early Celtic warriors used was symbolic. James Horner's music score is magnificent and moving, Randall Wallace's script is exceptional and stirring in spite of its inaccuracies. The Sons of Scotland speech always moves me to tears as it reminds me of the sadness of Scotland's history. God, I love this movie!",
457,26 February 2010,Aaron1375,9, FREEDOM!!!...and more blue paint while your at it.,"I do not usually enjoy historically accurate period piece movies, but this one really worked for me. Probably had something to do with the fact it was rather violent and had good action scenes. Still, I even liked the parts of the movie that had little action as the ending to this one was rather emotionally powerful. How Mel Gibson did not win an academy award for acting is beyond me as he did just as good a job or even better (in fact I say better) than Russell Crowe would do in the movie ""Gladiator"". Still, he got best director and best picture during the days when he was not crazy (or the days when he hid it better). This film tells the tale of Wallace a man who tried to break Scotland free of English rule back in the days. Why did he begin this crusade, well this is established in a early scene where Wallace's new wife is killed by the British guy in charge of the area. Well William Wallace quickly gets his revenge and soon begins his quest of trying to liberate Scotland from the Brits. You have a couple of rather good action scenes that involve the standard arrow attacks and the charge of two factions. Very well done and there is a bit of humor to this one as well. The movie though is not all action as we get to learn of things about the king who rules England and his son who is married to a very beautiful lady, but for some reason he does not seem to care for her much 'wink'. The final scenes of William Wallace are very emotionally charged and powerful and despite a somewhat sad fate for the main character, the film ends with one final charge. In the end a grand movie that I am always surprised did not make more money than it did as it did not even break the 100 million dollar barrier despite being a very good film.",
458,17 September 1999,x-tothez,10, It made me think...I well die but have I really Lived?,"""Your heart is free, have the courage to follow it"" Wallaces Father.  This is the only movie i have ever watched that has enlightened and endowed me with something. Mel Gibson is absolutely unbelievable in his unrelenting quest for freedom, however he is just not simply fighting for freedom from bondage to England, but freedom from the oppression within his lands. He is trying to unite the heart of Scotland within itself to stand up to its outside oppressors. This movie is an enigma in filmmaking. How often do you see hollywood make a movie that holds up true value and tru love in the quest for life. i have seen the movie at least 20 times. It also depicts Wallace as a holy man driven with determination, enveloped with loyalty to his countrymen, himself, his country, and his God. If you have seen it and admire it then you will remember when Wallace was in the jail awaiting his torture and he prayed to God to give him the strength to do the right thing after he could've took the poison. Because he knew that taking the poison would only bend his will and give him weakness in the greatest test of his beliefs, and if he couldn't stand for his beliefs fullt sober and aware then how could he ever believe in what he had done. I think this is the greatest film of all time- not just for the story-not just for the direction and the strength that it has-or the effort and attude Gibson and the rest of the film crew put into it, but for the wholesomeness it brought up in me- it made me think of who i am and what i believe and what i will stand up for. and more importantly if i have that courage to embark on my belief. a masterpiece, a milestone for hollywood. Mel Gibson desrves so much credit for this film. The best film ever made by a long shot. Ryan",

I like them, because they can serve as some entertaining lessons in history and in general they offer a lot of action. But somehow in the last 10 years I never made an attempt to watch ""Braveheart"". Why? I don't know, but it hast to be have been my instinct for good films. This movie full fills one thing, it hast some good action scenes, and yes, the costumes are fine too...but that's hardly all about this film. Now, from what I read about William Wallace and the historical background, this film is absolute nonsense. So, no entertaining history lesson...maybe in parts entertaining, but never a lesson...it's more like a fictional story about a superhero. Everything about Wallace in this movie is just great. He's the most civilized person in this movie (maybe in the whole world), he's so very just and noble...and his enemies are simply the contrary. Everything in this movie is just so over-the-top-clich√©-based it's hard to sit through this movie....there's hardly any believable character in this film. Just some examples that made me really mad, because of the 100% Hollywood-Conventions: How does it come that the french princess falls immediately in love with a man she only heard about?! That's pure Hollywood-Trash! Of course she gets pregnant from Wallace's first try... Of course Wallace's enemy Edward dies only a few minutes after Wallace himself...so there seems to be a heavenly justice. Of course Wallace's last word shouted out, just before he dies is ""freeeeeeedom"", yeah... ""freedom"" that's a good Hollywood-message! Now that I saw the film it even reminded me at ""Passion of Christ"", which I think is a great film, but knowing that Gibson made Braveheart 10 years before it seems to me as if should have been the Beta-Version of Passion"". He leads his people, you see him crucified, he is a martyr and in the moment he dies, his fellows just watch him, and are not willing to die with him for their thing. I watched ""Joan of Arc"" some days ago, and that was a really great intelligent and entertaining film, that is much better than this one... for me it's unbelievable that Braveheart ranks among the best films of all times... incredible.",

The movie has everything, evil villains, brave heroes, exciting battles, romance, humor and a message. If the message is somewhat unclear in today's context, freedom is still the goal f William Wallace and his followers, the desire to rule themselves rather than to submit to outsiders. Visually, this is an exceptional picture, from the colorful costumes to some breathtaking scenery. The battles are brutal and filmed with an eye for the spectacular, flights of arrows, the heavy horse charge, the bloody hand to hand fighting and the desperation of the fighters are well filmed. One complaint is that there's no bridge to be seen in the battle of Stirling Bridge. The romance between Wallace and his village bride is well done, and her execution is heart breaking. His faithfulness is doubted in the movie as he sleeps with the Princess Isabella which is extremely unlikely. The climactic scene of Wallace screaming for ""Freedom"" rather than mercy from his executioners is as powerful as anything put on the screen in the last decade at least. ""Braveheart"" is an epic in the old sense and is an very good film.",

Yes, it is not historically accurate but historically accurate does not make a movie, entertainment factor does. Despite the inaccuracies I believe the movie deserves only the highest of appraisal and is a huge accomplishment in film making. The soundtrack is breathtaking and really sets the mood. The acting is among the most believable performances ever and there is of course the occasional lighthearted comedy to lighten the mood. I must congratulate Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson and how can I forget Stephen The Mad Irishman played by David o'hara. I've watched this movie more times than I can count.

I am primarily of German descent, with some English, Swiss and Irish thrown in. But a good deal of my father's side is Scottish. I am descended from the Murrays, the Turnbulls and the Jacksons, and I am proud of it. This movie has only further cemented my pride. Mel Gibson (say what you want about his world-view, his directorial style, his factual accuracy) has created one of the greatest epics in cinema since ""Spartacus"" (I know, I know, usually it's ""Lawrence of Arabia"", but I've never seen that. I have seen ""Spartacus"", though, and loved it.) The story told is of one of the greatest national heroes of Scotland, William Wallace. He, like many, wanted a peaceful life; love, land, and a line, but he was willing to sacrifice that so that others may have that and something else as well: freedom. He lead an army of commoners against the mighty armies of England and King Edward ""Longshanks"" the I, and struck fear in the heart of tyrants and those who blindly serve them. Gibson plays this hero with courage and passion, bringing to life this man whose real life is still shrouded in uncertainty and mystery. Ultimately, he dies (in a fashion reserved for the highest traitors, but Gibson goes light for the sake of those who have already weathered over two hours of the bloodiest 14th century combat.) but his death inspires the men of Scotland to fight and die for the one thing Wallace chose to cry out for in his last breath. There are great performances across the board by Patrick McGoohan, the pagan king of England, Peter Hanly, his weak, homosexual son, and Angus Macfadyen, as the powerful Robert the Bruce (who is not officially my namesake; my grandfather's middle name was Robert, but I would be proud if Bruce was my namesake.) Macfadyen portrays a man born to power and authority, torn between his conniving father and Wallace. Ultimately, he chooses to follow in the footsteps of the fallen Wallace, saying the film's most powerful line: ""You have bled with Wallce, now bleed with me!"" Braveheart, though a hard film to watch due to it's sheer brutality, is now one of my favorite films. It makes me proud to be a (part) Scot, it makes me proud to be named Robert, and it makes me proud that my ancestor William of Rule (purportedly) saved Bruce from a raging bull, thus earning his clan their name.",

494,21 April 2004,CitizenCaine,9, Gibson's Braveheart: A Valiant Film,"Mel Gibson's second directorial effort is a very good one, but stops just short of greatness. It's the story of William Wallace, a Scottish hero, who fought for Scotland's freedom from England's rule early in the 14th century. The film reveals Wallace as a simple man turned romantic/idealist in a time when there were too few of them to count. Some have taken issue with the story of William Wallace according to Mel Gibson. However, it's clear, and the film makes this known, that we really know very little about the real William Wallace. Therefore, the film is a fictionalization of his life. The film takes a while to build from Wallace's days as a child until the adult (Gibson). There's one real touching scene with Wallace being consoled as a child. When Gibson appears on the scene, the film really picks up. He plays Wallace as an intelligent, intense man, who becomes a leader of men by necessity in order to fight for his country's freedom. There's action in the form of bloody, brutal battle scenes. We see a variety of weaponry from the era, some may not be. Several of the close-ups we see in battle seem designed to shock us rather than to propel the story or illustrate character, with the exception of those clips we see of Gibson hacking away.",

While the film can get a bit slow at scenes, it makes up James Horner's amazing soundtrack, and for it's beautiful cinematography and atmosphere, it makes you feel like your right there. The slow scenes don't necessarily make the movie 'worse', but it makes you feel ingested in the screenplay. The movie is not historically accurate at all, and even though I'm not really into the historical accuracy and everything....... it can get really annoying.

508,18 April 2006,MerryRane,10, Who says Braveheart isn't great?,"I've seen Braveheart over a million times and I still watch it to this day. It's a great movie with some amazing cinematography. Mel Gibson really saw something in the not-so-specific story of William Wallace and so he took that and ran wild with it, which is a good thing. Sure Braveheart is rather gory, but what if it wasn't? It wouldn't be so great, I can tell you that much. Patrick McGoohan (Longshanks, Kind Edward I) and Angus MacFadyen (Robert the Bruce) portrayed their characters in a spectacular way. They showed perfectly how greed over power can force a man to do whatever it is in his will that lets him do so. Then there's always the good character, which here is William Wallace, but sometimes the/a good character can be tricked or persuaded into giving himself to the other side, for his life, or for something of lesser value. But Wallace (Gibson) didn't want that and he obviously didn't care whatever it was that was going to happen to him, because he wanted it not only for himself, but for his people. And that is a grand quality, and a grand character.",

510,8 April 2008,liquidsnakemi,10, Timeless Classic,I first saw this film when it came out. When it came out I just loved it. Even now 13 years after it originally aired it is still as good as ever. This film deserves a 10/10. The directing in this film is superb. Mel Gibson is one of the greatest directors of all time. The acting in this film is also exceptional. I think Mel Gibson might have gotten an academy award for both his acting and his directing in this film. Apart from Mel Gibson all the other actors played their parts brilliantly. One thing I loved about this film is how it focused on the human side of William Wallace that was a definite plus. I also enjoyed the cinematography of this film. It captures the landscape beautifully. Overall this must be one of the greatest films ever made. A definite 10/10.,

And will be for years to come. The music is epic for each scene and will leave a memory that you can only hope for when watching a film. Much like Hans Zimmer's classics nowadays, this music is higher and higher. Mel Gibson as William Wallace, I can only say, is a 10/10. The story is exhilarating and keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the acting is Oscar-worthy on every single level. I only wish, after all the years, I had listened earlier when told to watch this. Honestly, I now have Braveheart as my favourite film after Interstellar, and Interstellar was a huge film to beat in my mind. If I could give more than 10/10, I would. Bravo to Mel Gibson!

After this movie Mel Gibson became one of the best actors in Hollywood also I believe he is one of the best 3 three directors from worldwide with Spielberg and Tarantino. Gibson created a great hero. I think best scenes were execution and betraying scene. I loved the dialogs between Robert De Bruce and his father. Gibson worked hard to make everything real as medieval England. Scottish people speak with their accent as same Irish and English people. Also he did well in Passion of Christ on making everything exactly in 2000 years ago.

The acting is fantastic and so is the story. Mel Gibson does his best acting in this movie, playing William Wallace, who leads the Scots against the British. Mel Gibson isn't the only person who gives off a fantastic acting job. Sophie Marceau plays Princess Isabella,the poor girl stuck in a loveless marriage and dreaming of Wallace, the man she's always wanted. Throughout the entire movie I was cheering for her, hoping she would somehow get a happy ending. Another fantastic acting job was Patrick McGoohan, who plays King Edward of England. He's ruthless, heartless, and power hungry. In my opinion, Mr. McGoohan should have gotten an Oscar nomination for his part. However, as much as I loved all their performances, my favorite performance was done by David O'Hara, who plays one of my favorite characters, Stephen, the Irishman. Yet, as much as I loved this movie, it was not my favorite. It was rather long and seemed to drag out just a tad bit. Some parts could have been cut a little shorter.

Sure, some of the accents are bad due to the lack of actual Scottish actors, and it's historically inaccurate, but every time I watch this I always end up feeling thoroughly entertained. Mel Gibson said on the director's commentary that films are made first to entertain, then teach, then inspire. I couldn't agree more, it's a far more rewarding outlook on films. He put everything into this, and it shows. I remember the battle of Stirling scene being the first time I had ever seen a large scale battle played out realistically on screen, using no computers, just lots of extras. It's immense and is a fine example of directing skills. Gibson himself plays the part really well physically, but in terms of excellent acting, Patrick McGoohan stands head and shoulders above everyone. His portrayal of the tyrannical villain is brilliant. I also believe that James Horner's instantly recognisable score rounds out the film perfectly. Uilleann pipes have an incredible sound and can invoke a great sense of rebellion and courage, which suits nicely",

Mel Gibson doesn't make any long lasting impression as Sir William Wallace, Scottish national hero in his country's fight for independence from English rule in the thirteenth century. But he is still Mel Gibson and this allows him to take a non-fiction based movie and beat the sense out of it when it comes to facts. I have to give Gibson some credit since it was his passion for the role that brought the movie into the sight of Hollywood and it gave Mel the chance to pull off the triple play - act, direct, produce.

Being part Scots myself I'm embarrassed this film was ever made with it's distortion of history, we don't need it, the period was interesting enough not to require Mel Gibson's lies.

That shows how much time and effort he put into this movie. As a director, he was quite good at it because all the effort he put in to this movie, was finally awarded and the Academy Awards. He probably learned a lot from a Man Without A Face because that was his directoral Debut. Finally he was awarded for Best Director and Best Picture of the year in 1995. Randall Wallace was also a genius in this movie. He was the writer of the movie and moved on later on with Mel Gibson in We Were Soldiers and he directed that movie.

He has all the Celtic nations represented with the thickest accents they are able to muster splattered in woad and draped in fur but little is mentioned about their motivation they meekly follow offering nothing. The battle scenes while well done, don't leave you routing for them, they just wash away in to the back of the battle scene. Although Gibson seems to take particular pride at portraying any English man as either twisted and evil or weak and effeminate, what happened did the Queen forget to send him a Christmas card?

It is deserving of each of the 5 Oscar's it won though I believe Mel Gibson should have won for best actor as well, especially since there was no other performance of that year that came even close to his, yet strangely he wasn't even nominated. Of notable mention is the lighthearted yet dedicated performance given by David O'Hara as ""Stephen, the Irish fighter"". His performance added just the right touch of levity without detracting from the storyline or ambiance. Brendan Gleeson's performance was perfect as well, in fact each role was filled to perfection. Although this film clocks in at nearly three hours, at its finale you find yourself wanting even more, much the same as elicited by such other great films as, ""The Hustler"", ""Dances with Wolves"", ""The Great Escape"" and so forth. Another way to sum it up would be to coin the old adage: ""time flies when you're having fun"". Simply Excellent!",

He said."" fight and u die, don't fight and u ll live, only for a while , from this day till the time u re dying in ur beds u ll be praying just for one chance, one chance, to come here and tell all of them in true words and courage ,that they may take our lives, but they may never take "",OUR FREEDOM,"".

After being over brutalized before the execution, he was just asked to say mercy and mercy will be given , what Wallace replied,"" Freedom...,"". in the end when Scott forces were again facing British forces under the command of infamous Robert Bruce , they were again asked to submit to the commands of king Edward. Than Robert Bruce waves his sword and the close friend of Wallace of Wallace throws his sword into the air , a reminder that Wallace story , his legacy and passion never ends at his death. A message is given in this movie. Freedom never comes in for free, it is achieved by sacrifice and continues struggle and dedication. Lives are lost and homes are shattered.

True it is an extremely violent movie with wall to wall action but its all based on William Wallace's love for his wife and it is what drives him and gives him his strength until the end. It is a great date movie, it has it all action, violence, love, and an emotional ending. If you rent it or buy it make sure you get the Widescreen version!!",

576,4 June 2000,Corleone-29,9, Fiery!!,"Clint Eastwood needs to take lessons from Mel Gibson who did a great job with this semi-epic rumble. Braveheart is a movie that is filled with great emotion. In fact I find it difficult to believe a person could watch this movie and not feel anything for the main character William Wallace. Sure the plot is your basic revenge for love destroyed good guy bad villain standard but that is not what makes this movie tick. Great landscapes, score driven, and violently picturesque battles and added with a touch of romance make Braveheart scream down the film highway. And once again it is the supporting cast that I feel overshadow Gibson's performance. Especially Patrick McGoohan as the ruthless Longshanks. In my opinion this is the part that makes or breaks this movie and it definitely made it. If you are going to have a villain in a movie not only do they have to achieve that hated look their actions need to match. Longshanks behaved how like a King trying to enforce his rule should. He was smart, cunning, and rarely did he lose his temper unless it was needed. If this sounds familiar then watch the Godfather and Michael Corleone. The comparisons between their actions are very similar. Wallace's fellow Scots and soldiers were also well chosen and added characters that made Wallace even stand out more. I am impressed with the way Gibson chose his shots. From the ground shot with the sword appearing fifteen feet on the screen to the shot at the end with the cloth he understands that when there is a defining moment in the script you need to do something even more to emphasize it. Make it stand out in the audiences head. This is where Eastwood sorely lacks as a director. His films have potential to be more than he puts into them. Especially Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil that just screamed from every page of the screenplay for a director to drive it like a Ferrari on an open road. Gibson rightfully deserved the Oscar and he understands how difficult and restless the directing experience is. But he is also unwilling to take a great script and let it go to waste and for that I give him his do. Braveheart is a grand movie that will be a classic for years to come. It invokes volcanic emotions and returns to a time when men fought for love and freedom with fearless passion.",

Its such an indescribable feeling that you have after you have watched this great film. ""you cant have life without freedom"" well said. many themes and very significant points are also made in the film.

584,10 August 2008,Seneschal118,8, Good,"And that's the problem really. The battle scenes are well directed, but Gibson seems to revel in making it as gory as possible. Gibson, while not doing a bad job as Wallace, looks like a straggly Kevin Costner from Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves who's lived away from civilisation for a while. Mind you, he conveys the wild side of the Scottish rebel's character well, and gives a good performance. There are several historical inaccuracies in the film, such as the ban on playing bagpipes stated near the beginning (about 450 years early). The affair with the queen is ridiculous, but serves as a plot device. After all that, you're probably wondering why I gave this an eight. Despite all its faults, Braveheart is beautifully filmed, attractively scored and the acting of the majority of the cast is positive. I would not go out of my way to see this film, but if it's on television and you aren't busy, I would recommend you seeing this film.",

Gibson's power and conviction combined with the script draws you into a wonderful story of passion, honour and love. it is a long film (approx 3 hours) but i could barely remember where i was by the end. if you watch only one film in your life let this be it, don't bother renting it just buy it its a safe risk, I've never heard a bad review and this is definitely one you'll want to keep!",

Mel Gibson delivered a patriotic, stellar film for the ages showing the determination and love of one man that changed an entire nation and gave it the strength to gather together and stand against tyranny.

The English kings are portrayed too ridiculously one-dimensional (total evil) and I'm sure things were a lot more complicated; and the love story/affair is just too absurd.  This is probably the most inaccurate story of Britain since William Shakespeare penned ""Richard III.""  But of course this film is far from being anything the Bard would have done.",
590,4 March 2003,WriterDave,10, One of the Best,"There's just something about this quasi-historical big sweeping epic that gets me every time. The schmaltz and romance works, perhaps because it is wonderfully balanced by gorgeous Scottish vistas and some of the grittiest and most gut churning battle scenes ever put on the big screen. This is the movie that every battle scene in every movie since has tried to top in terms of amazing choreographed carnage. Mel Gisbon makes William Wallace out to be a mythic sized hero and freedom fighter whose most heartfelt desire was to be left alone to raise a family on his own terms and by the sweat of his own brow. Powerful stuff beautifully shot, appropriately scored, reverently acted, and ultimately unforgettable. The revenge plot is a familiar and archetypal story that is often told, but not often told this well (much like ""Gladiator"" in that respect). This is grand epic film making at its most heartfelt best and sincere.",

592,29 August 2014,bryan-clark-93-937081,5, Historically inventive,"This film by Gibson is very imaginative, but should never be interpreted as being historically accurate. Personally, I disliked the graphic violence, the awful details of guts being ripped out, etc., but this degree of violence seems to be the norm for Gibson - he seems to think it adds realism or impact. When he has the Scottish rebel seducing the English queen - well, I'm an Aussie Republican, too, but do we have to resort to this level of dishonesty to make an impression? I think it was a great pity the account did not stay closer to the facts; that would have been sufficient because the ancient truths of the era were impressive enough.",

It took a lot of guts for Mel Gibson to star in the film as well as star in it and he deserved that Best Director Oscar. Rarely, have we seen actors who have direct themselves into a good performance. i believe that i saw it in Mel Gibson. this may be one of the best war movies that i have ever seen. all of the cast members were wonderful, especially Mel Gibson. The battle scenes may be a little bit stomach-turning and brutal but, as the viewer, it is important to show the violence of what happened between the Scottish and the British back at those times and it is brilliant film making and the best fight scenes ever captured on film. this is a film about the fight for freedom and the courage to free your heart and follow your dreams and to achieve it at a high peak. I also thought that the music was wonderful too as well as the cinematography which was beautifully filmed. The music, by James Horner, gives a deft subtleness of the movie and creates the tone. I recommend this film to everyone because this film is like a sonnet as well as a history lesson. it is a incredible movie and a film that will live on forever.",

There are so many moments of profound beauty and dignity. After 170 minutes you just know that there is so much more to life than seemed to be three hours ago.

I thought the cinematography was amazing... the fight scenes were some of the best ever filmed... and the story was filled with passion and emotion.  However, they were a few parts of the film that just didn't work for me.  First of all, the story was quite one-dimensional.  If you are looking for anything else behind William Wallace's revenge against the evil King of England, you won't find it here.  In fact, the main characters do not grow or change throughout the movie.  Second, the romance between Wallace and the Princess is not very believable.  It moves way too fast and doesn't work with the rest of the story.  Third, the acting is far from perfect.  Save Gibson's performance, no one else stood out as particularly memorable.  Finally, the movie is overlong.  However, these flaws do not detract from a generally, very well made movie.  It's a movie intended to inspire... and for many, it does its job.  One of the better pictures of 1995 (behind Usual Suspects, of course) and a solid 8 out of 10 in my books.",

603,27 September 2007,Eowyn1967,3, A very predictable film,"Apart from the many anachronisms and lack of historicity of Braveheart, I'm very disappointed by how predictable the whole film turned out to be. Those directors must really think their public are idiots as they keep rehashing the same stories over and over again. It looked more like a Scottish western than any accurate portrayal of mediaeval Britain. What is more, all the villains were far too wicked and one-dimensional to seem realistic. It left me completely untouched and uninterested apart from the romance at the beginning of the film. The claim that Wallace fathered the future English king, that's farcical at best, one does not even need to check historical dates to know how preposterous this must be. What's the point of making a film about a real historical character and then rewrite history completely? Gibson should stick to fiction. But historical faithfulness is the least of his worries, he had his characters speak Latin in The Passion of Christ though historically they spoke Greek, Aramean and Hebrew.

One of the most powerful films of all time; Braveheart simply cannot be missed. I have yet to meet a person who did not like this picture, as well as someone who does not think it is one of the best films they have ever seen.

Actually bagpipes were unknown to the Scots before their introduction by the English and were still unknown to the Highlanders in Wallace's time. King Edward died several years after Wallace and for that matter neither did the princess give birth. There are many other such fallacies throughout.  The great victory of the Scots over the invading English was not in ""open"" battle; the Scottish archers mowed the English troops down as they attempted to cross a narrow river ford on the way to Stirling castle. The Scots never wore blue face paint. That was a practice of the pre-Gaelic Picts who were recorded by the Romans as doing that. Wallace's army never conquered York.

His use of battle sequences, heroics, and individuality ring eerily close to that of ""Spartacus"", ""Gladiator"", and ""Ben-Hur"", yet even with these clich√©s riding well within the film, Gibson creates his own style and voice. Watching this epic, one must take it in four different slices to fully appreciate the work, and while they all may pair differently apart, it is what they do together that creates the magic. To begin, the direction is nearly flawless. A scene that stands out is when one of the nobles is dreaming of an attacking Wallace, only to wake and witness Wallace barge in through the door in a beautiful black stallion. It, like many other scenes, was breathtaking and flawless. Gibson has an eye for shots that are considered ""beautifully gruesome"", meaning that colors, placement, and camera angle are visionary, while the action on screen may make your stomach a bit squeamish.

One aspect of the movie that held my interest is how we are able to see William's character as an innocent child and as a grown man whose fate becomes that of a hero. This is a widely viewed movie, but if you haven't seen it yet, I encourage you to check it out and see if it appeals to your taste. It's serious, emotional, and powerful!",

I could watch this flick over and over, just to hear that word, ""freedom."" I know there has been some criticism about his 'Scottish Accent' ‚Äì pfffft ‚Äì I wouldn't know a good one if it came up and bit me ‚Äì so I thought it was outstanding. There is no holding a candle to this man's abilities. Enough talk about Mr. Gibson for the moment. Now for the rest of the cast, let's see...there was that New Yorker, Patrick McGoohan who, as always, was perfect...and yes, he was born in New York. And then there were other folk running around and doing stuff in the movie, but I really don't know who they are and nor do I care. An emotional plot with lots of fighting and sword play and fighting and battles and fighting and loud yelling and fighting ‚Äì and that is all I need. The other movie stuff ‚Äì filming, production and cinematography were all outstanding. That guy directing, Mel Gibson, did his always flawless job of tying the whole movie into a superior package. I will remind those who question the historical accuracies (or inaccuracies), please remember this is not real ‚Äì it's only a movie¬Öit really is. In other words, it's not real, it's only a movie.

625,18 June 2008,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,8, Really great,"Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning 1995 Braveheart is an impassioned epic about William Wallace, the 13th-century Scottish leader of a popular revolt against England's tyrannical Edward I (Patrick McGoohan). Gibson cannily plays Wallace as a man trying to stay out of history's way until events force his hand, an attribute that instantly resonates with several of the actor's best-known roles, especially Mad Max. The subsequent camaraderie and courage Wallace shares in the field with fellow warriors is pure enough and inspiring enough to bring envy to a viewer, and even as things go wrong for Wallace in the second half, the film does not easily cave in to a somber tone. One of the most impressive elements is the originality with which Gibson films battle scenes, featuring hundreds of extras wielding medieval weapons. After Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, Orson Welles's Chimes at Midnight, and even Kenneth Branagh's Henry V, you might think there is little new that could be done in creating scenes of ancient combat; yet Gibson does it.",

But the scenes takes place in Scotland and the landscapes are very beautiful.I love when the cameraman films that. I like too how they did the production and the acting. But they don't reproduce very well what happened in reality. What a shame ! I don't know if I will recommend you to see this film.

I could watch it everyday and still feel moved when the Scotsman chant, ""WALLACE! WALLACE! WALLACE!"" at the end. The story line is a great one, the fight scenes memorable, and the soundtrack top notch. The London Symphony Orchestra did a tremendous job on the music, as I could listen to the Main Title and the Freedom Theme all day long. Gibson's performance of William Wallace is memorable. It is also a comedic film, especially when all of the Scotsman lift up their kilts on the English right before battle. The English then try and shoot them with their arrows and after the first round, all of the Scotsman once again lift up their kilts. The scene with the Irish is also a memorable one, where they all charge at each other, then stop and shake hands. At once, they all attack the English. This is also when Wallace is captured. The memorable line of the film is when Wallace is tortured, then wishes to speak. He shouts out, ""FREEEEEDOM!"" Once again, this film can be watched over and over.",

634,12 July 2000,pieschel,9, Mel Gibson is definitely one of people's favorites!,"Braveheart is probably one of the best war movies to hit the big screen. With winning five academy awards (but it deserved more), its hard not to like. With an excellent performance from Mel Gibson and a unforgettable story, Braveheart is a movie that will not lose its popularity over the years like some other war movie trash like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""The Thin Red Line"". Although the war scenes don't really show what war was like (instead, they focus on the gore of war), the story line and romances are enough to satisfy most people. Most people will agree that the constant gore was unnecessary but you don't notice this until a few hours after you watch it. But be warned: Mel Gibson saved this movie immensely by directing and starring in it. If he hadn't played William Wallace, the acting would not have gotten good reviews from the media as Sophie Marceau and Catherine McCormack failed to please. Oh well, at least they didn't appear a lot. So, if you're a fan of war movies and want to be pleased after many nights of grief from other movies of the genre, Braveheart is a movie you will surely want to add to the family collection!",

643,17 April 2020,krational66,9, Sensation,"Wallace is an American hero, with a very American ideology and way of doing things. Historically, he was, I believe, hardly a British rebel on a cultural level -- Robin Hood was.
The background of the story is nothing more than a stage for the director to express his inner stage. We love this movie because we love the pure heroes: the forthright, the brave, the quick-witted, the righteous, the daring to hate and love. Throughout the film, at least the treatment at the end of the film is in line with Wallace's character. ""If you fight for freedom, you are a free man,"" is one of the grandest phrases in the movie, and most of the time it's more inspirational than melodramatic.
This is the pinnacle of a hollywood-style hero film that includes almost all the elements of the genre: war, heroism, love, betrayal, hehe. What is valuable is that the film is full of emotion from the beginning to the end.

Where on earth do you imagine all this iniquity flows from? Human Nature, good luck improving it. The glorification of the Scots and the concomitant delineation of the English as Satan's imps, forgive me, speaks more to Mel being an Australian than to historical veracity. There is this unrelenting demonetizing of the English right out of a comic book. The Lords Of The Congregation who ruled over Scotland, for a time, were not renowned for their heavenly saintliness towards papists. This is the other problem the movie's deep sense of historical unreality about it. You feel right away that you are getting a parallax view, a very biased one sided picture.",

The acting is top notch and the directing is superb. The best Mel Gibson movie ever! The war scenes are amazing. Not for the squeamish. There is a lot of blood and gore and you do see a lot of people being stabbed and killed all over the place. But this movie is all about war so that's what you've got to expect.

What I took was this film was the in-depth look at what makes men... well, men. To many characters in the film, there are different beliefs in what makes a man noble. I will not spoil the enjoyment for anybody, all I'm saying is GO SEE IT. If you have seen it, see it again. The film may be three hours, but when you watch it, that time will feel all too short. Every second is worth it, with emotions that are not overdone like in ""Titanic."" I know of the Mel Gibson controversy and people rip on him for his dumb beliefs, however, most will admit that he is a wonderful filmmaker and actor. I usually like movies, though this tops it all, even ""Lethal Weapon."" I even liked his ""Passion"" film (and I am NOT a religious guy), but that is nothing compared to this. Again, what really blew away about the film was the depth, the musical score, and the cinematography. The shots of Scotland were incredible as well as the beautiful battle scenes. The score made me smile for days on end, particularly when I left the theater. There is just something about it that holds you in its grasp until days after you watched it.

680,29 March 2020,yuenyeeac,8, Braveheart,"The hero in the hearts of the people of Scotland, William Wallace, was born in oppression, grew up in oppression, and died in anti-oppression. He seems destined to shoulder the heavy responsibility of opposing oppression and achieving national freedom. The death of his parents planted the seeds of revenge and freedom in William's naive heart. The death of his lover provoked anger in his heart. He led the people of Scotland to start a long journey to freedom. In that country where God believes, God seems to have given William Wallace incomparable courage and wisdom. His courage awakened the people of Scotland under oppression. His wisdom frightened the Scots. He even beat the city, and the good news spread frequently. His ideals are everywhere, admiring the people and shaking the world. The ending is tragic, weeping ghosts and gods, the last word he said was a word that he shouted with his last strength-Freedom. At the last moment of his life, it is still his ideal for the benefit of the nation.",

The plot, production, music, acting, etc - an absolute masterpiece. Gibson is an incredibly gifted director and actor - one of my favorite parts in the movie is the speech he gives to rally the Scottish troops when they are about to flee. ""And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days - from this day to that - for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies, that they may take our lives but they'll never take our freedom."" The courage and bravery of Wallace and the masterful hands that put this movie together reflect the glory of God. ""Do you see a man skillful in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before obscure men."" Proverbs 22:9",

However, the film is also quite propagandistic, not just in its lack of historical accuracy.

There is not an actor in this movie that does not play it's part to a T.   The fighting scenes are unmatchable by any and the graphic violence is just enough to make it special,  but not too much to turn away someone that doesn't like that sort of thing.   The fight for freedom in this movie rivals that of anyone. Being that this is a true story,  they had much to work with.... but it still deserves more credit than any other movie that I know.   Even the ending is not your typical movie ending and it leaves you breathless and wanting more.   You'll definitely be moved emotionally after watching this piece of art.

697,14 October 2009,Dr_Coulardeau,10, The birth of nationalism in Scotland,"William Wallace, a commoner, is a legend, a myth, a hero for sure in Scotland. In his thirteen century he opposed the rule of the king of England over Scotland and the ruthless colonial attitude of that king and his soldiers. Why a commoner and not a noble? Because the nobles accepted to be paid prisoners, salaried slaves of the king of England. As a commoner he only suffered the ruthless violence from these soldiers and the indifference of these nobles. He started a rebellion against the English and that rebellion actually swept the whole Scotland and climaxed in the battle of Stirling. He had managed to bring the nobles behind the commoners and he got a full victory. He was knighted at once but did not change his logic. So in order to force the king of England to grant Scotland full independence he crossed the border and attacked the English at home. He took and ransacked the city of York, and killed the duke of York, the very nephew of the king of England. But in the next confrontation the nobles betray him and he is defeated after the nobles leave the battlefield. The Bruce gets him off that battlefield in due time. But later on the nobles again will betray him again, attract him in a trap and deliver him to the king of England. He will be duly executed as a traitor. The film evokes that treatment though it remains rather far from the real stuff and the fact that he was executed on the day before the Bartholomew Fair on the Fair ground itself as a festive entertainment added to all the others by the king himself. The point is historical and the film is valuable because of that historical dimension. A commoner could easily bring commoners together and make them fight for their freedom, even their national freedom. That is the birth of popular nationalism, of nationalism as such, the only nationalism that represents some historical progress, that of the people, of simple people. That nationalism is going to develop in Europe over the coming centuries, but we can witness its birth in Scotland here. At the same time the film shows very well that nationalism is in absolute contradiction with feudalism. That nationalism is based on self-pride and individual freedom, and the protection and guarantee of that individual freedom. The right of the first night (the local esquire or noble has the right to make love to the newly wed woman, before her newly wed husband on the evening of their marriage) is one of these unbearable privileges of the nobles. Furthermore, the nobles satisfy themselves very well with the financial dependence on the king of England, as long as it does not question their local dominance in Scotland over the local Scots. They have no real national spirit, and the freedom of the people is not their problem. They have sworn allegiance to the King of England and that guarantees their privileged position and they are quite satiated with that. At the same time we must understand a different approach of feudalism that is no longer very active in our minds. The king was the very secular representative of God due to his appointment by God himself, under the only authority of the Pope who is the direct spiritual representative of God on earth. If such is the reality of feudalism, then no one can question the decisions and acts of the king, certainly not the nobles who are under allegiance towards that king. A duke can fight against a count or another duke, because they are of the level but they cannot fight against the king who is over them. But the surprising element is that the battle of Stirling took place on September 11, 1297 some 80 years after the first signing of the Magna Carta and 30 years after the final acceptance of this Magna Carta that shows how the English nobles and the English Church actually joined against the king to impose onto him some freedoms that were unheard of before. I tend to believe William Wallace was the development of this Magna Carta and that it brought the third social element into the picture, the third estate, the commoners. The defeat is all the more significant, and the execution is also all the more significant. It was more a martyrdom than anything else. We know that a poet, Blind Harry, will turn the oral legend into a myth with his epic poem written at the end of the fifteen century. This film is just the adaptation of this myth.",

All the cast were excellent Bruce was great and the princes was brilliant so was long shanks. Mel Gibson is the greatest ever and he is also brilliant in forever young. For a man his age i think he is just brilliant. Anyone that thinks Goodfellas or whatever you call that film is better than Brave heart there is something wrong with your head. My favourite scene was the one were William and Pricess Issabelle kissed I think both actors were very convincing and you could see the William really did love his first wife. This film will never be forgotten i also think Mel added good humour into the film especially the scenes at the battlefield were they flashed at the enemies. Mel is a brilliant actor as well as a brilliant director.and all yas English people that are saying that mel Gibson made the English to evul well he didn't mak them as evil as they really are he portrayed this film brilliantly and his Scottish accent was just brilliant and everyone from Scotland that dissapproved of Mel in this film and mocked his accent should be ashamed of yourselfs Mel did your country proud so stop your yapping.

I like his way of acting. Braveheart is gory and very bloody. i love his freedom speech. it is one of the best if you watch this movie you will feel moved. This Movie is centered around the Scottish revolution when they broke with england or rather when they try. A Scottish man by the name of William Wallace steps up and takes action as you know Mel Gibson is William Wallace. as the movie progresses the Scottish learn quickly and they follow their hearts. so this movie is great for any of you movie lovers.,
706,6 February 2019,CubsandCulture,8, It is far better if you think of it as high fantasy epic,"This film is aggressively ahistorical. Some choices examples: serfs don't know what freedom is, there should be a bridge at Sterling, Isabelle was under 10 when Wallace got executed, prima nocta was not a thing. Basically, the film gets most of the names right. It also tends to get locations and broad outcomes of battles right. But that is it. If you think too much about this stuff the film becomes a farce.

People can argue about the facts of the story and the parts played by the names in the history of Scotland.  What cannot be argued is that Mel Gibson turned in an heroic performance as William Wallace, and his direction helped tell the story with equal parts heart and guts.

To truly feel what the character feels is a gift, and Braveheart is definitely a giver. From beginning to end, it hooks you in and takes you on an emotional roller coaster of sadness, joy, anger, laughter and ultimately an understanding of what it really means to believe in something. It really is a movie that everyone can enjoy. There is drama, action/adventure, romance, comedy and absolutely breathtaking scenery. Mel Gibson did a brilliant job of both staring in- and directing.

As for Mel Gibson, it is known that there are a lot of enemies of him, there are a lot of people who hate him. Why? It is because he is a deep catholic and you are not? It is because he did a speech about Jewish people, when he was drunk? or it is because you think that the movie is one sided, it shows some English people as evil? or it is because you are a nerd who doesn't forgive any movie, if it has historical inaccuracies? As for being one sided or racist, should we toss movies out, if they are one sided, even if those movies are cinematically and artistically great? This is the key question. If so, for example Saving Private Ryan is an awful movie either, right? By the way since I am not English, I can't know what you feel, so about this point, English people might be right. If I had been English, may be I would have hated the movie too, but in these circumstances, as an historical epic, as a war movie for me, it is one of greatest movies of all time and the best historical action ever! You may dislike this movie, I can understand that, but trolling is not my cup of tea and I find it unfair, so what really disturbs me is those kind of ugly and nasty stuff, written by people. I mean that some say that acting was awful, direction was awful etc. I like Mel Gibson, he is one of my favorite actors / directors. I believe that in this movie, he gave one of his best performances, may be the best. William Wallace. With his long hairs, blue eyes, with his mimics, stares, hard looks... His face while looking at the man in their first insurgency, his face while looking at the blonde child. These are great moments in the history of cinema. The final was one of the most 'heavy' and heartbreaking finals ever made (of course not for the people who hate him) I know that the haters watch that with pleasure. Direction, Mel Gibson, Mel Gibson's interesting William Wallace interpretation, cinematography, its dramatic impact and because of the battle scenes, I love Braveheart. Some people claim that Gibson imitated Kurosawa's Ran, sorry but does Ran has even a real battle sequence? And I know that it will be very assertive, but in terms of direction, mise-en-scene in battle scenes, Gibson is much better than even the master Kurosawa. If we don't count The Lord of the Rings, you cannot find better battle scenes in the history of cinema! The most well planned, the most detailed and the most epic battle scenes are here. To me, Saving Private Ryan is the greatest of the all war movies and Braveheart is the greatest one of the all battle epics.",

I thought that Mr. Gibson(who claims to be scottish himself) put on a clinic in both his acting and direction of the film. Other great performances In the movie came from Brendan Gleeson, David O'Hara, Patrick McGoohan, James Cosmo and Sophie Marceau, all who are very underrated actors/actresses.

""Braveheart"" is composed of one brilliant scene after another, all due to Mel Gibson's excellent directing, as well as his superb acting. From an early scene in which the little girl hands young William Wallace a flower at the grave site to Wallace pleading to the enemy to apologize to Scotland's people in an almost unreal way, great care and direction was clearly given to every scene in this film. The battle scenes do not drag on too long as in films such as ""Lord of the Rings"" but instead are just long enough to keep us engaged. The battle scenes are masterfully balanced with scenes of dialogue and character development, which is important because it helps cause us to care about the characters. The film is brutal and violent by nature, so most likely it is not for everyone. Nevertheless, it's nearly perfect for me. Gibson draws the detail out just long enough to tell his whole story and still keep us engaged long enough to watch it all. A great, brilliant film, worthy of many of the Oscars it received. I can honestly call this one of the best films I have ever seen.",

So of course, I have always heard the stories of William Wallace, heroic patriot of Scotland, but never before had Wallace's story seemed so real, so tragic, so compelling and noble, as the first time I saw it realized in glorious color as it was in Braveheart.  Though since I first saw the film in May 1995, I have heard some people criticize the historical inaccuracies of Braveheart, I can say for my part that this film brings to life the essence of Scottish spirit and Scottish pride as many Scots understand it, and that is ever so much more important than the force of any nit-picking negative criticism launched towards Braveheart.  The power of what Braveheart conveys on an emotional level is reason enough for all Scots to value the film, but it also appeals to what is universal in all people and what all of us value, yearn for, and fight for: Braveheart appeals to our sense of justice and forces us to ask ourselves the question, ""What price is any one man--am I--willing to pay for freedom?""  It shows us the unconquerable spirit of one man and one nation, and kindles in us all a new sense of our own fortitude, strength, and valour.  I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed by this film, in my opinion, perhaps the best, or at least the most enjoyable, film ever made.",

The Academy Award winning war epic Braveheart is an extraordinary film that set a new bar for the genre. The story follows a Scottish peasant named William Wallace who's pushed into leading a rebellion against the tyranny of English rule when his wife is murdered. Starring Mel Gibson, Patrick McGoohan, Sophie Marceau, and Brendan Gleeson, the film has a strong cast that delivers outstanding performances. Additionally,the battle sequences are remarkably gritty and violent, which adds to the authentic tone of the film. And, composer James Horner provides a sweeping and majestic score that's incredibly powerful.

It really should've been made as a one off mini-series. I said that, because the character development could've been explored more.
Patrick mcgoohan's presence as king Edward I was commanding. His son, Edward 2, played by Peter Hanly, was wishy-washy. Much more development of him and his boyfriend, would've been nicer.
Sophie Marceau portrays queen Isabella is perfect. Her character's real story - Isabella of France, the she-wolf, is worthy of her own film. She was between 5 and 7 years old, when William Wallace was executed.
French actress Jeanne marine playing Nicolette was understated.
Angus Macfadyen who plays Robert the Bruce was outstanding, in particular at the end.

I won't deny that ""Braveheart"" is just spectacular, and the battle sequences are so exciting (they did a great work there), but did this movie REALLY deserve all those prizes? Well, it is kinda grandiloquent (those images filmed from 2 or 3 helicopters of Wallace on the top of a mountain!! It reminded me of those excessive clips from Guns N'Roses), demagogic, and Gibson's character seems to be a premonition of that long-suffering Jesus Christ from ""The Passion"".

The film directed and starred by Mel Gibson has too many violent scenes, one may say that this is the mode of Gibson, but historically the film goes well. It is seen when William's father is killed and also his young wife by the English soldiers, the fights uniting Scots, some of them wealthy and susceptible to betray. The battle of Falkirk is an example of betrayal by those Scots looking for their personal profits and less interested in the sovereignty of their country. This battle was practically the end of Wallace. Although he hid himself for a while he was captured, brought to London, where he was tried, convicted and executed (the history said that this happened in 1305). One of the things I am not sure is that the son of princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau) was really a product of her relations with Wallace.

The battle scenes in those two later films are clearly influenced by Braveheart so it deserves credit for that. With Gibson making the soon to be released The Passion (which, having conservative Christian sympathies, I am really looking forward to) it is interesting that he cast himself as a Christ like figure. I'm sure most people know this but what is presented here is not entirely factual history but an interpretation of a myth.

781,18 January 2016,toinnetteeadd-172-560189,10, what i think of Braveheart,"This was a mid evil soap opera that kept me on the edge of my seat. It had all the things a good story needs. There was action, gory battles, also a little romance. We all know the best fights come from a broken heart lover/mate. The acts of bravery and love displayed by Sir William Wallace were extraordinary. The fierce determination and loyalty and friendships you see in the movie are something to be desired and envied by all. The whole movie was a strong fight from people who wanted what we all want for ourselves, Freedom. So i think we can all relate to that struggle of life in some type of way.So if you really think about it we all have a little William Wallace in us or can respect what he fought and died for, love and freedom",

However, Mel Gibson does a great job, not only as the director, but also as the leading part, William Wallace. It's a bloody movie, but it's so nicely put together, that it doesn't nauseates you in the same way other movies might do. Although, it might sicken you to see the way people sometimes treat other people. While seeing this movie, I got angry with England for what they did to Scotland. I got angry when I saw people betray someone on their own side of the fight, all because of greed. Braveheart is a beautiful movie, that fills you with joy, love, anger and sadness. However long this movie might be, I still advice you all to see it.",

There are not many films which I'd rate a 9 or 10, because I'm a nitpicky viewer and a film really has to really wow or move me to earn a near perfect rating. Braveheart definitely wows, and it's near perfect. I've watched this film many times over the years and it's always as exhilarating as the first. From the acting, to the writing, to the cinematography, it's cinematic perfection. And, it's stood the test of time and aged incredibly well to boot, being 23 years old at the time of this review. There's been many a film released after Braveheart of the same genre and many films tried to capture the spirit, if you will, of this masterpiece. But Braveheart is yet to be duplicated.

It's the story of what a true hero is. A man who simply said ""Enough!' and went to war to change his country for the better. It is a movie that shows how an ""ordinary"" person CAN make a difference. It is the epitome of love, loss, and the fight for freedom and rights. We need more of this in the world today!

Few movies can make a case for helping to change the history of a nation (it played a significant role in arousing the patriotic zeal of the people of Scotland who soon voted for a separate Parliament from that of the UK after hundreds of years of minority participation in that larger Parliament).  Having already read some books and stories about William Wallace, I was thrilled when I learned that there was going to be a film about him.  I became even happier when I found out it would be an epic movie, as I'm a major fan of the sweeping epics!  I was somewhat skeptical about Mel Gibson as Wallace, but once the movie came out his performance dispelled my concerns, and I was pleased that he was cast for the role.  I loved the color, the pageantry, the awesome scale, and the pulse-quickening action (big guys whacking at each other with swords and axes WAS bloody, so the level of violence was appropriate!) of Braveheart.  So, they went a little overboard with the romanticism and villainy, but in my mind that only cost them one rating point out of ten.

The point is; ""Who cares""?  I loved this film for its sweeping scenery, its epic battle scenes, and its underlying message of hope and the triumph of the spirit that it represented.  Most treatments of ""larger than life"" figures (Joan of Arc, Field Marshal Montgomery, George Washington, etc.) concentrate on those aspects that make them memorable, often leaving out anything that would lessen their stature.  Think of this as a fiction movie, if it makes you feel better, and just enjoy it for the masterpiece of film making that it is.  ""Braveheart"" was well deserving of the best picture award, along with ""Contact"" it is one of the best films of the decade.

It is incredibly one-sided, with the Scots being portrayed as innocent heroes while the English are pure evil who rape women and kill children. The large amount of fighting and gore was unnecessary and quickly became boring to watch. The romance was laughable. Wallace's wife only served as a plot device. She was killed after attacking a soldier who tried to rape her. Wallace was so enraged by this that he kills half the Englishmen.

The women actors cast in Braveheart did not look remotely like the strong, tough, usually dark haired women i know as ""Scottish highlanders""; in fact, the women in this movie had elfish, gamin-like appearance and were considerably skinnier and daintier than any crofter's wife or daughter would have been. these people worked hard to survive, everyone had to be physically strong, not delicate and flimsy. otherwise, an excellent movie. the ""hollywood"" look of the women was a bit distracting as my great grandmother looked down over her big nose and strong hands at me from the family portrait in my living room.",

Braveheart belongs in that category. Mel Gibson's lifework, after this movie he never made something as great as this one. He directed it and played the main role, and came as close to art as he possibly could. It's not the story that makes this movie so great, it's the complex and realistic characters, their motives and there actions. I was thrown into the movie right from the beginning, all the way till the epic ending.

Mel Gibson is okay in it I guess.  The battle scenes are cool for about 5 minutes.  All of the dialogue is dry and drawn out.  It's about 3 hours too long.  Mel Gibson's ass is awesome..... I like blue face paint though, so that's a plus.  But, I'd honestly take MadMax (or even Lethal Weapon..maybe) over this pile of crap anyday. I guess he made this movie to get people ready for his other directorial garbage: Jesus Falls Down A Lot (also known as The Passion).

Thanks to this movie his spirit lives stronger and deeper in our hearts. Reminding us that we are free. Because of his braveheart we are free! No one can deny it. This story told by Mel Gibson might not be fully accurate but he (Mel Gibson) captured the most important thing on camera. The struggle that gave people insperation and hope. Braveheart!

Braveheart, however, commits no such error.  Truly an epic.",

Despite being well paced, the 3 hour runtime still felt too long, and the battle scenes were good for the time but in retrospect feel dull. The best parts about this film were the strong acting by not only Gibson but everyone involved and the cinematography, which was stunning at times.

The story is loosely based on the life of William Wallace, a Scottish warrior who fought against English domination in the late 13th century.

It's pretty good on the technical front: the battles are great, the costumes are neat, and the pictures are stunning (or at least interesting.) But the script is so thoughtless, so blatantly Hollywood-ized, that it's impossible to take any of it seriously. Unfortunately, the actors play it like friggin' Shakespeare. The script is transparent as it divides characters into heroes and villains, then divides them again into superheroes and supervillains. And the ""dramatic"" moments (such as ""They'll never take...our FREEDOM!"" or ""Every man dies, not every man truly lives"") feel phony and jingoistic. Mel Gibson isn't made to play superheroes. His persona is a balance between heroic bravado and self-deprecating charm. In a movie this melodramatic, he feels totally false and out of place.",

And, 21 years later, it's still the best epic movie I've ever seen! Being an epic movies fan, Braveheart gives me everything I expect to see in a film of that genre: history, drama, adventure, action, great plot and superb scenarios. Despite being filmed in 1995, it's a spectacular super production, through the particular vision of Mel Gibson, only worried to tell a grand epic in classic style and transmitting with great intensity the anger and pride of a man (William Wallace) who always refused to live under any enslaving tie and gave all for the independence of his homeland. The script is simple but extremely effective, the rhythm does not decline at any time, combining with great assertiveness the epic and massive battles (at the time really innovative by the realism given to the actions) with more intimate moments. I also would like to highlight the sensational work of Mel Gibson (both acting and directing), the good performances of Patrick McGoohan and Angus McFadyen, and the presence of the beautiful Catherine McCormack and Sophie Marceau, in a film that will endure forever as one of the best.",

As a young boy his father led a failing rebellion against the British rule in Scotland. Years later William Wallace decides to lead his own Scottish rebellion, after his wife is raped by British soldiers. He unites the people of Scotland and uses smart military tactics to bring down the strongest military force of the time. Bloody, gruesome battle scenes are shown throughout this movie, to depict the true horrors of the fights for freedom. William Wallace was a real man, but most of the rest of this film (about 90%) was fictionalized for dramatic emphasis. This did not result in a bad film, but just an inaccurate one.",

874,19 September 2014,mrmurdocku,1, Was a Great Movie,It was a great movie until recently when some Scottish people decided to spit on the graves of their ancestors. I particularly enjoyed the part of the movie where William Wallace talks about freedom. It was a very inspirational part of the movie. I found it motivational until 8AM this morning. That's when the Scots tucked their tails between their legs and decided to live fat and happy off the queen forever more. If I had voted No I would be extremely ashamed of myself. I would like to see Braveheart 2. William Wallace could drive a taxi in Glasgow and live in a council house with down and out souls who were addicted to methadone. He'd wake up at dawn everyday in order to watch the union jack rise over every house in Scotland. Kilts would have long been banned and use of the Scottish accent punishable by death. Haggis would be served from a tin to dogs. Men's only clubs would be all the rage and PVC suits the hottest commodity in Scotland. The French would constantly travel to Scotland for stags and prey on the weakness of the Scottish. What a movie!,

met your purpose. This movie kind of lays the ground for uncelebrated
acts of heroism in intelligence agencies and similar outfits where the
joy in work achieved almost always is entirely personal and given to
personal growth as opposed to a social one. While yearning for social
growth is inevitably, and without fault, ingrained in our collective
upbringings, the trick lies in spotting where joy lies in a society ever
geared to give just 3 hours of attention before they move to uncelebrated places of personal glory, sometimes in the bedroom, and
sometimes in the boardroom (sic).",

I've never been oppressed or been forced to fight for my freedom, but I do have to struggle to remember the many people who died so I wouldn't have to.  This film helps me remember.  The story moved me, even if Mel Gibson ""sold out"" (after you make a film like this, you can never sell out!), whatever that means.  Gibson did a fine job as Wallace, I could cheer for him, I could feel what he felt, same with all the characters, which says a lot about Gibson's directing abilities.

I still think so, but I just wanted to get out some words of other people that commented on the movie a long time ago, but no one actually reads them anymore because they don't know how to get to the older ones.  You got down to the comments index, and it's highlighted. Click on it and it will have a history of the comments on Braveheart or any other movie.  Then, I read a great review of two people.  Please read on. One of them stated that in Scotland, beside the William Wallace statue, there is another statue of Mel Gibson and people are leaving flowers on it because he made the movie and made Wallace famous again, I think that's their point. I disagree with that because it's not hard making a movie when you have millions of dollars.  Also, the other stated that Gibson, the director, was asked by a Scotsman why he didn't film the Battle of Stirling Bridge actually on the rebuilt bridge, Gibson said that the bridge would get in the way.  The Scotsman said, ""That's what the English found too.""  Why doesn't Gibson talk about Braveheart on any of his interviews and is, in my opinion, ashamed of it?  I think that's one of the points.  So to any Gibson fan, who consider him a great man, if you sit down with him, by yourselves, you'd find that he's nowhere near the stature or the hero that Sir William Wallace was.",

To start off with, I know it is very inaccurate, but not completely.  Although William Wallace had a much more exciting life than shown in the film, Mel Gibson does a terrific job at acting as William Wallace.  The only dumb thing about the movie is that Gibson isn't nearly as tall as William Wallace, Wallace was 2 meters tall.  Also, they do disrespect Robert the Bruce and his father, but with that, God had to give them the gift to act so good.  So they didn't do anything that was so bad.

In Braveheart, Mel Gibson plays and becomes William Wallace, the leader of the Scottish rebellion. This movie takes place in the XII century, I watched Braveheart three days ago and already in the first view, we can see some inaccurate points. First, Wallace was not the children of a farmer. Seconde, he was not the leader and he wasn't appreciated by his people. Third, we can see the faces of Scots were painting in blue like the color of Scotland but this is not the good period. The Scots painted their faces against the Romans, a long time before. Finally, in the movie, Wallace was tortured and decapitated. His last word is ""Freedom !"". But for a men who is being tortured, Mel Gibson didn't play it well because he don't cry, he didn't suffer. And history says we didn't know the last words of William Wallace. In my opinion, Mel Gibson wanted to do a great movie but he didn't care about the history, it's pity. However it's an amazing movie with the effort of Mel Gibson to do the Scottish accent and the battle scenes.

Anyone who doesn't like this film immensely doesn't deserve to live. This is the best movie ever made, and I don't care what anyone else thinks, it just is. Few films have ever even come remotely close, only The Lord of the Rings, Saving Private Ryan, and Gladiator can be compared.

933,17 January 2022,jamesforeman-87634,6, Good historical film,"I agree with everyone on the history of the Welsch invaders and the Scots rulers in 1656. Edward I, ""Longshanks,"" is reputed to have been one of the most ruthless rulers of England. He died two years after the death of Wallace. That was a year before his son married Isabella of France. So, all the parts of the film about her, Longshanks and Edward II are pure fiction. An Encyclopedia Britannica article reports that Edward II may have had relations with men as well as other women and his wife. The Scots under Wallace did invade and conquer parts of northern England, but they did not get as far south as York as shown in the film. After the major defeat at Falkirk, which the movie shows, Wallace disappeared for four years on the continent. He returned to Scotland and resumed his fighting when he was captured. Wallace's execution is one thing that the movie shows accurately - but much less graphically than it actually was. We don't know what was said, of course, but the manner and method of his execution is accurate with recorded details. Perhaps we should have seen more of it to realize the gore and horror of English punishment in that time. After his trial on August 23, 1305, he was stripped naked and dragged through the city by a horse. He then was hung, then disemboweled, then beheaded, and finally drawn and quartered. His head was mounted on London Bridge for a time and his limbs were sent to the four corners of Britain for display and deterrence against revolt. Still, history records that the Scots has the last word with the ensuring victories that established their independence.",

I want to praise Mel Gibson for the work he put into making this movie. His vision as director was first-class and gave the movie a 'grandness' that it deserved. It is also a great achievement for Gibson to star in the movie, playing the integral character of Wallace, a difficult role. For his direction of Braveheart, Mel won the 1995 academy award for best director. I love all the battle scenes in 'Braveheart', as they are filmed in a big and bold way by Gibson.

Braveheart was an azmaing epic film about Scottish hero William Wallase who leads Scottland from the wrath of Edward thew Longshanks., an ruthless English king.

The casting and acting is superb and couldn't have been better. The directing and absolutely everything is exceptional. The script is one of the best ever, all in all it is just the best film ever made, anyone that disagrees will probably think its the godfather or shawshank redemption, both brilliant but cant compare to this masterclass. The guy who plays the irishman steals the show for his humour,as well as the old guy that goes through so many pain barriers but still wants the blood of the English all the way through the film. If nobody has watched this i would recommend it to everyone, although the film does have violence in it, it is for a purpose, but what story about freedom and revenge doesn't.

These movies are way too different. If we speak about the battle scenes in ""BH"" the battle scenes were filmed with actual actors, while in ""LOTR ROTK"" they were extremely well modelled. And for me it is a huge difference. The same thing is with recent ""Troy"" movie - yes, the battle scenes look good, but you cannot feel them. When you watch ""LOTR"" or ""Troy"" you are more likely to say ""Wow!"" than ""Oh my God!"". And I think there is nothing fascinating about the battle scenes. People die there. In BH you have a very strong feeling of being in the middle of the real battle and not inside of the PC game.",

(well, maybe Lord of the Rings) but this was made in 1995:) It's epic war scenes set the standard of what war scenes should encompass. This movie was known for its bloody, graphic fight scenes.

The little known actors in supporting roles were all superb and intense in what could have easily become a bore of a movie.

I still think that Braveheart is a wonderful movie but I think in my humble opinion that Mel Gibson wanted some similar impact and success with the movie The Patriot, like he had with brave heart and he competed with one of his own good movies and that was not necessary. I don't think that other movie about wars like Braveheart can be better,Braveheart is good and then you don't want to see similar plots in others movies, because you already know what is good.

The script may not be historically accurate, but the medieval atmosphere is flawless, the acting is superb, and the score complements and sharpens the passion of the struggle portrayed. 
 The story revolves around three men that exemplify Hollywood archetypes William Wallace- an man of uncompromising principle, personally devastated and wholly devoted to his cause. 
 King Edward I- A pure villain in the context of this film, the whites of his eyes glow with evil. McGoohan is tasked with difficult soliloquy which he delivers without contrivance. 
 It is Robert the Bruce, however, that is the film's most compelling character. Whereas Wallace and Longshanks are one dimensional- their actions are guided by the rails of their existence, The Bruce grapples internally with acceptance of the seemingly inevitable- defying his father who attempts to steer him down the path of the cynic. 
 While Wallace is supported by his loyal friends, and Longshanks will is unchallenged by his constituents, The Bruce must find the strength to forego the safe path chosen by his nobles and family.

Many critics have bashed `Braveheart' for its inaccuracies, but nowhere in the film does it claim to be a documentary. `Braveheart' is simply a marvelous movie. From its sweeping battle scenes to its romantic, intertwining love scenes, everything is perfect. The acting throughout is superb, and the action sequences stunning. Randal Wallace's script is matched only by so-called movie classics such as `Citizen Kane' and `The Godfather'. There is no better a speech in any movie than Wallace's own `I Am William Wallace' speech, and no more poignant a movie moment than during Wallace's disemboweling (with the visions of his wife). Leonard Maltin said it best with `a passionate film about a passionate man'. `Braveheart' may not be the `best' movie of all time, but it is certainly is my, and many other's, favorite.",

The problem is the subject is historically inaccurate in its portrayal of events and so much so that its damaging. It feeds anti English hate with its lack of accuracy and balance. While art should not be overly constrained things that pretend to portray historical events owe it to the audience to try to tell an accurate and balanced story. Of course this is a common mistake and we see it frequently in other films (most cowboy and indian flicks miss the genocide of the native Americans and the awful treatment thereof),

The ending was so sad that it had to make any man who watched the movie seriously cry. The ending with him being tortured when he said freedom mixed with the princess of England crying and the King dying was so powerful, including the very ending when Gibson narrates the very end about how they fought like scotsmen..and they won their freedom so so strong.

Directed by Mel Gibson and released in 1995, this film is a true masterpiece of cinematic storytelling. It is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll, and one that you will want to watch again and again. If you haven't seen it yet, you are missing out on one of the greatest movies of all time. What sets Braveheart apart from other historical dramas is its emotional depth. Yes, there are plenty of bloody battles and thrilling action sequences, but there are also moments of quiet reflection, of tender romance, and of heartbreaking loss. This film is not just about the struggle for Scottish independence, but about the universal themes of love, loyalty, and freedom.",

They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder and when I finished this movie, beauty, my eyes beheld. When I reached the end, when it faded to black and the credits started rolling, this immense feeling of wrenching emotion, yet fulfilling satisfaction completely washed over me. Truly a feeling I hadn't felt in a very long time, if ever. This was definitely one of those films for me that is so good, that I end up finishing it and not even realize that it was a whole three hours long! I don't even know where to begin.
If I'm being entirely honest here, I didn't exactly go in to watching this movie with the highest of hopes. Somewhat low hopes actually, but wow, words could not even begin to describe how incredibly pleasantly surprised I was. I suppose I can begin by mentioning how breathtaking the visuals and shots of the highlands are. Prior to watching this film I never even realized what a beautiful country Scotland really is.
On another note, and I don't even exaggerate when I say that this film contained nearly every last element that I love and look for in a film",

The story of William Wallace and how his legacy rallied the Scots to fight for and earn their freedom is very gripping.  While the movie is about 3 hours long (and I had the luxury of a pause button), this is one of those movies where you don't want to get out of your seat until it's over (Lord of the Rings:  The Return of the King is another).

1041,29 February 2004,samur4i,10, The Best Movie i've ever seen,"A magnificent movie. Mel Gibson sure deserves some credit. He directed and acted as the main character. He created a magnificent movie. It starts out in Scotland, with Edward the Longshanks ruling over it, a cruel pagan leader as the Scots say. Finally the Scots rebel, led by Wallace, his rebellion triggered by the death of someone close to him. His close confidantes are hilarious. The Irish man, his old best friend Hamish and his fiery father, are the best supporting characters I've seen in a long time. Funny and loyal. The performances of Edward Longshanks and Robert the Bruce are great, as with the Princess of Wales. Their awe/love/hate of Wallace all leads to a climatic ending, that inspires a raw spirit within you to rise up. Its powerful and chock full of emotion. The brawling part comes from the explicit violence. But in truth, that was how I would've imagined a movie like this being. Its skimps on nothing, throughout everything else it shows Scotland how it really was. Why should it skimp on the brutalities of war? Beheadings, slitting of throats, impaling, the list never ends. But it fits with what the movie is. Its a movie monument to the need of freedom. ",

1045,23 March 2004,gpmac,10, THE BEST MOVIE NEXT TO THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST,"To quote the main character William Wallace (Mel Gibson); ""FREEDOOOOOOMMMMMM!"" This is a story of the people of Scotland fighting for the right to be free. From the actions of the self-righteous English King Edward I (Patrick McGoohan), Wallace is forced to take a stand after his wife Murron (Catherine McCormack) is killed for fighting back as an English guard tries to rape her. Wallace, trained by his uncle Argyle Wallace (Brian Cox) after his father was killed holds nothing back in his vengeance on the English. Wallace does not see this fight as needing anyone else involved, but all of Scotland stands with him to rid Scotland of the English. Mel Gibson did a fantastic job taking the legend of William Wallace and adapting it to a modern day representation of what audiences want to see. Forbidden love, heart, honor, and action all rolled into one great movie portraying the underdog fighting back against a seemingly unstoppable foe. Braveheart has even more conflict than just that of Scotland and England. During Wallace's fight we also see King Edward fight with his son's choice of companionship as the attempt to produce an heir to the throne only causes more tension in the kingdom. Princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau) from France becomes the bride of Prince Philip (Stephan Billington) and finds herself in the middle of the conflict and does a wonderful job of dealing with Prince Philip, Wallace, and King Edward I. Conflict also ensues with Scotland's Nobles fighting with each other for rights to land and succession to the throne. Battle scenes were done quite well by my point of view. Whenever you have that many actors there is bound to be some mistakes, I didn't even notice them until most were pointed out to me. The editing of the battle scenes must have been a long and painstaking task on its own. Matching emotion and lighting, blood stains and wounds, who had an arrow in their butt and who lost limbs, what a mess. Steven Rosenblum did a fantastic job with the editing. Mel Gibson seems to have a thing for the English, if you like Braveheart you need to also see The Patriot (2000). In this he also is wronged and sought out by the English, forcing him to fight back only to have all of colonial South Carolina stand behind him as he fights to protect his family. Braveheart is a great movie and very entertaining. As some reviewers and history buffs pointed out, there are many flaws compared to the original story and time line, but stories are written by those that want to entertain.",
1046,23 June 2013,hull10,10," To quote the main character William Wallace (Mel Gibson); ""FREEDOOOOOOMMMMMM!""","The first time I saw this movie, i was about 7 or 8 when my parents bought it on video. I watched it, and didn't really understand any of it, because I was too young. I've seen the movie about 30 times in the past 2 years, and I see something different every time I watch it. It might be something in the scenery, or I might just not remember. It is amazing. I wish more movies like this would be produced. The battle scenes were exciting, the storyline was fantastic, and throughout this three hour movie, there was never a point of which I was bored. The only thing that I can say that is negative about this movie is that it could've been made into a 2, 2 1/2 hour movie. Mel Gibson stretches scenes out that don't need to be stretched out, and there is always a long pause between people talking, but I guess he just wanted to movie to look more majestic, or something. But, it is still an AWESOME movie!",

He is a Scottish boy whose family is murdered by Edward Longshanks, an unjust English king. At their funeral he meets a young girl named Murron, and in one of the most touching scenes in cinematic history, she gives him a flower which he keeps for his life. He then leaves to live with his uncle Arygyle. When he becomes an adult he returns to his birthplace and falls in love with Murron. When she is murdered by the British, he kills the British soldiers which took part in her murder, and vows to fight for Scotland's freedom. The movie has some of the most beautiful, and sometimes funny, battle scenes. It is a favorite of mine, and is worth watching just to hear William cry out ""FREEDOMMMM.""",

I couldn't imagine someone giving this movie a poor rating because of some minor defects it may have. It might have some cinematographic errors, but that's not the point. The point is to express history as a watchable, visual experience. I'm sure Mel Gibson felt proud to play William Wallace, for in his mind he's recreating history. Though, for that reason, I give this movie an 8 instead of a 10 star rating. More of the actual history could've been included. One major flaw in the storyline of the movie (which had a window of 3 whole hours), is that it did not show the preparation Wallace's army had to go through to be able to fight the English. They went from pitchforks to axes to swords in no time at all in the movie version, but in the real-life historical version, it took some planning. Wallace was seen as a hero, but his victories came at more than a price than what was shown. I wished there was more rape, murder, and adultery in there to show just how cruel the English were. Anyways, that's my review.",

Tonight I was all alone at home and I suddenly had the urge to see this awe-inspiring work of art again. I got all set for the film, put in the tape, got a beer, pizza was nice and hot, then I pressed ""play"" on my vcr......it's hard to explain this feeling that came over me......""I shall tell you of William Wallace..."", but all you Wallace/Braveheart fans know what I'm talking about...I was like mesmerized throughout the entire film, although I knew nearly every line, each frame, I've heard Horner's soundtrack countless times ever since the Summer of '95......there's some kind of undefinable magic in this film (I wish I could use another word than just ""film"" or ""movie"", I find these terms not appropriate). Of course, needless to say, no other picture ever moved me to such an extent as Braveheart did and still does......and it doesn't seem to let go......before Braveheart I had various so called favorite movies, like star wars, ET, Raider of the lost arc....they were all indeed very nice, very entertaining, humorous, and warm movies, but in no way can they live up to Braveheart, 177minutes of love, hate, passion, anguish, despair, humor, hope, pride........you name it. Maybe this is the secret magic of Braveheart: it grips you by the heart, doesn't let go, takes you on a 3hour emotional rollercoaster ride, never giving you a break, taking you to extreme highs and in the next minute you simply feel you're going to die of sorrow. Of all the times I've seen Braveheart, tonight, I think was the first time I saw it in complete privacy, the phone didn't even ring! It's amazing, I'm a 32 year old guy, not the macho type, but it does take quite a bit for me to cry...but in specific scenes tears did escape my eyes: Hamish's dad passing away........the part where the princess tries to persuay William to beg for mercy..........the realization that strikes William like a hammer when he sees robert the bruce when he tears of his helmet after the falkirk battle............when the bruce feels like pure s**t (forgive me) wandering along the corpses at the blood-soaked Falkirk field, realizing what he had just done...........and , of course, William's FREEEEEEDOM.......what more can I say, I'm happy I could share my thoughts with you and I feel when so many different people react to a film in a such similar way, well, it makes me feel good, I mean, it's just a good thing to know that people react so positively, it's kind of a binding experience in a cyber sort of way:-) right, thanks for reading my personal notes.",
1057,20 July 1999,alba-5,10, simply the best,"Mel Gibson is wonderful actor. His portrayal of William Wallace is almost flawless. This movie is a story of one man's commitment to freedom and his love for and loyalty to his country. Mel Gibson must have worked for a long time to get his accent to sound so good. It is almost a perfect Scottish accent. Even though he is not Scottish. But aside from great acting not only by Mel but also the rest of the cast, the story line is like no other ever told. Since it is a true story it is very moving and inspiring and will bring even the hardest at heart to tears. WATCH THIS MOVIE AND LOVE IT. It is the best movie ever made, and possibly the greatest story ever told!",
1058,20 September 1999,groff,10, My Favorite of all Time,"A comment by dr_necron on March 7th states that Wallace met Isabella when she was 12 years of age which was the year before his death.  I find this hard to believe because he was in hiding in Scotland at the time and she was mainly in France.  Does anyone have any information to support this? I would appreciate such info. She married Edward II after Wallace had been killed, but in the movie she is married to Edward while he lives.  She is shown in the movie to mediate between the Scots and Edward I, but she actually was a mediator between Edward II and the Barons.  She was a remarkable woman!  Her real life would make quite a movie.  She put her son on the throne in place of her husband and then he eventually put her in prison for most of her life.  She lived to be 66 which was quite old for those times. The battle scenes in this movie are very well done.  The acting is excellent.

After all, it is very much worth it. The Battle at Stirling is one of the greatest battle scenes I have seen in any movie. Many war movies have stolen little things from this movie.

But it has ideas, well above its station, about being a historical film, about being a film with a message. This turns an average good vs evil yarn into a bit of a joke. The trouble with real life is that it doesn't fit the Hollywood mould. So it gets bent out of shape. No film is completely historically accurate but Braveheart has a mass of cringingly bad mistakes. It gets his name right and puts some battles in and has him killed. The rest is fiction, almost nothing it right - from the blue paint that is supposed to be woad through to the romance with the English Queen and the siege of York, all wrong. It's a film that will annoy those who value history and still cling to the idea that modern films are capable of showing it. All this aside, it's not a bad film, just don't take it on the level it wants to be taken on and you'll be okay.

I wouldn't think that i was going to LOVE this film. First of all, the actors have been perfectly chosen, Mel Gibson was made to play William Wallace even though he isn't Scottish a all. While watching Braveheart, i've been though so many feelings: joy, sadness, anger, excitement. Joy when Wallace achieved to make Murron his, sadness when Murron's throat was slit, all the sadness and anger that Wallace felt, I felt it too ! I almost cried when Wallace was tortured at the end of the film, during all the battle between Scottish and English, I was as excited as them, I wanted them to kill them all ! But when Wallace and Isabelle got ""married"" I didn't understand Wallace, how could he do that to Murron but anyway ! Braveheart is very well played, the actors are great, the story is wonderful, when you watch it you can only be focused on the film, it's so fascinating. I must admit that it's really worth the three hours. It became one of my favourite films and if you watch it entirely it'll be one of yours too !",
1069,3 March 2017,estellebk,8, A beautiful movie.,"This film mightn't mean much to Americans but for the Scots and Irish, Mel Gibson couldn't have done a better job in capturing and portraying all the emotions of a proud nation - love, hate, revenge, betrayal to name but a few. The battle scenes are immense with the extras doing a great job to portray the savagery of battle during this time period. Mel couldn't have asked for a better support cast in Brendan Gleeson, Sophie Marceau, David O' Hara and Patrick McGoohan is magnificent as Longshanks. This film will test all your emotions both good and bad, leave you on the edge of your seat and truly if your Scottish, give you a great sense of pride. Well done Mel",

They got married but in secret because he was scared that she had to live the primae noctis with this horrible king. At a moment, his beloved was almost raped by these Scottish occupants.But, Wallace, as superhero, saves her! This action was my favourite because it was adorable!! Unfortunately, she was killed by the sheriff, it was so sad...But! Wallace took his revenge. I liked the way as even in jeopardy, Scottish were funny and courageous, and even if they had less weapons and less clothes to protect themselves, than the English. What's more, I admire courageous men (like Wallace) who can feel so sad if someone has made something bad to the girl they love. Braveheart was very admirable because it gave a moral, a lesson: ""fight for what you want""",
1071,3 March 2017,sarah-duarte,8, I loved it,"Braveheart will be watched a thousand years from now because it exploits the power that film as a medium possesses. It does this in the two ways that are most unique and powerful to film: Visually and emotionally. Emotionally, it brings us firsthand into the human experience. Braveheart gives us a sampling of all of the most powerful human emotions most of us experience over a lifetime: love, fighting for what we believe in, family, loss, betrayal, sacrifice, and revenge to name just a few. It takes a lifetime of emotions and feeds them to us in a few hours. It also shows how very two sided man can be. Wallace, (Mel Gibson), is both caring and loving, while at the same time being capable of horrifically killing and maiming his fellow man... a ""murdering savage"", (a line from the film, I think.) In addition to all of this, it is set to beautiful surroundings, and the battle scenes make great use of cinematic techniques. Notice there is no weird film special effects, such as we are seeing overused in too many modern films.. (traffic, etc). No digital ""soft looking"" effects.... Just great plain old filmmaking.",

While Braveheart may be entertaining to watch, it is a favorite formula repeated. My major discomfort with the movie comes right at the end when old Mel screams ""freedom"".  Contemporary viewers hear and know exactly what he means, but...people of the British Isles did not know ""freedom"" nor believe in it as we do today.  Individual freedom did not exist in Europe. Freedom for Wallace would be his ability to choose his own master from the aristocracy and not the freedom to be a king, as we would like to think we have the freedom to be today.  Individuals in the tribes of the British Isles were raised to be what their father's were.  They could be nothing else.  Peasants never became kings, and never believed they could.

I have to admit, the first 15 or so minutes of the film were less than exciting. I can deal with slow scenes if I feel that they have purpose and set up the film, but I felt myself having a difficult time connecting with William as a boy, perhaps because there was not enough development with him and his father. Thankfully, I managed to make it through this introduction because the film picked up quickly. Since I watched this movie for the first time a week ago, my opinion of Mel Gibson is not favorable, and so I thought this would be distracting. However, I immediately became entranced in the love story with Wallace's childhood friend. Her unjust death pulled me in the film even further.

It is the story of how one man, Wallace, (Mel Gibson) unites his countrymen to take up arms against the English for the cause of freedom and to crown Robert the Bruce King of Scotland and ultimately securing their independence. The film begins with a young William Wallace who has lost his father and brother fighting the English. After William's father's funeral he is taken by his educated and cultured Uncle Argyle (Brian Cox) who teaches William that he must learn to use his brain and wit, before he can learn to use a sword (Braveheart, 1995). Wallace returns to his home twenty years later and is reunited with his childhood sweetheart Murron (Catherine McCormack). The two fall in love and secretly marry to avoid the English right of prima Noctae, allowing an English soldier to sleep with the bride on the first night of marriage. Soon after, Murran is assaulted by an English soldier and in an attempt to escape, is captured, and killed. Wallace responds to her death with anger and to avenge her death, kills the entire platoon of foot soldiers. The other villagers join William in his fight against the English and eventually, the revolt becomes a full-fledge war.

The Scottish girl and her family are why I also have an ax to grind with Washington DC. They broke up my seven year marriage to my former wife, destroyed my personal life and even caused me a nervous breakdown. I had said in 1986, if someone were to actually start a legitimate insurrection in America for a cause that I believed in, I would also bear arms against our government. When you take everything away from a man that he has and he has nothing to lose, he can become quite brave as well. I waited for the revolution that never came.

Most of the twenty years of hate that I have endured from my two brothers and the government revolved around the issues of my refusal to finish my PhD and my refusal to become gay for the government! I will say this much, as Braveheart had seen his wife's ghost looking lovingly at him before his lost his head, I remember lying on my bed and feeling the strange sensation of an affectionate large dog kissing my feet and I wondered if that was Jesus Christ himself or his angel?

The writing in this movie is great, and the speech that William Wallace gives while riding the horse out on the battlefield just gets me pumped every time. Second, the acting is led by Mel Gibson but there are several other actors that get the job done. Third, the cinematography won an Oscar so not much to say about that. Fourth, the action and battle scenes in the movie feel real and are done perfectly.

1106,1 January 2015,bestopretor,10, epic!,"Braveheart (1995) is an action film, with a theme focused on character, based upon the life of Scotsman William Wallace (Mel Gibson) and his heroic battle to free Scotland from King Edward I, Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan), King of England. When Wallace was a child, he witnessed the King of England hang and murder the Nobles of Scotland. Shortly after, his father and brother went to war; neither of them survived. Young Wallace was taken in by his uncle who educated him and taught him how to fight. Years later, Wallace returned to his village to take over his father's farm. Here he reunited with Murron (Catherine McCormack), a young lady who had captured his attention before he left. He courted Murron and the two fell in love. They were wed, although secretly, because Wallace did not want to share Murron with the English leaders of Scotland (which was acceptable custom at this time for the English Lords to take a bride to bed on the night of her wedding). Here we see Wallace's passion and wit as he charms Murron and proves himself to his friends upon his return. Wallace is man of integrity who is merely trying to farm his father's land and start a family. While walking in the village one day, one of the English soldiers attacked Murron and attempted to rape her. Wallace came to her defense and attacked the soldiers and the two attempted to escape. They were captured and the English sheriff tied Murron to a pole in town and he slit her throat to make an example of her. After seeing this, Wallace rode in to ""surrender"" and actually ended up attacking the soldiers and murdered the sheriff in the same manner in which he slaughtered Murron. After his attack, Wallace and his fellow Scots formed a militia and went on an attack of England. After sacking the English city of York, and murdering its Lord who was family of Longshanks, Longshanks sent Princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau) (because the King knows Prince Edward (Peter Hanley)is not strong or threatening enough for the task) to persuade Wallace to surrender. Wallace denies the bribe and Princess returns, but only after the two share a private moment of understanding. In the meantime, Wallace was attempting to enlist the help of the Scottish nobility. They deny his pleas and later, two of them set him up in one of the battles. Here he is nearly killed by one of the King's guards, which he discovers one of the Scottish nobility, Robert the Bruce (Angus Mcfadyen), who saves Wallace from being captured just in time. Wallace goes into hiding and kills the two who betrayed him. Robert the Bruce, feeling guilt for his part in the attack on Wallace, set up a meeting intending to join forces with Wallace but was sabotaged by his father, the Leper (Ian Bannen), who has Wallace beaten and arrested for treason. Throughout each battle, their losses and gains, Wallace remains true to his passion for the freedom of Scotland from the evil rule of Longshanks. Wallace is imprisoned and set to be tortured unless he submit to the King of England. Longshanks has become terminally ill. Princess Isabelle first goes to see Wallace and beg him to surrender to King Edward; when that was unsuccessful, she went to see the King to beg for the release of Wallace. When he will not free Wallace, she informs the dying King that she is carrying Wallace's baby. Wallace in the end is tortured and murdered, standing for the freedom of Scotland until his dying breath. Robert the Bruce is crowned King of Scotland (through arrangements of his father the Leper) and in the end charges the English army instead of submitting to them and winning the freedom for Scotland for which Wallace had fought so hard. Director, Mel Gibson, also makes good use of motifs throughout the film to drive home his point. We often see scenes of Wallace, face determined, sword drawn, ready to fight for freedom at all cost. Another area of emphasis in Braveheart, is the power of love and what it can lead a person to do. It is his love for Murron is what set Wallace's anger into motion. The love of his country and for his father and brother are other driving aspects in keeping his fight for freedom. The angle of filming also adds to focus on Wallace's character. The camera is focused on him whenever he is in the scene. Many shots of him are filmed slightly looking up at him to make him seem larger, stronger, and more formidable. Braveheart has a similar theme and focus on character as Gladiator (2000). In Gladiator, it is Maximus who attempted to be executed for his moral upstanding. After escaping execution, he finds that his family had been murdered instead. Through the film, Commodus in fits of jealousy, attempts to rid himself of Maximus. Even after attempting to cheat to do so, Maximus still manages to kill Commodus and return power to the people, undoing the work of Commodus' time in power. Maximus, like William Wallace, also had a passion to uphold good and give people their freedom, with love as a driving force.",

1108,25 November 2015,tk-84278,9, braveheart,"The film Braveheart shows the epic tale of a hero fueled by vengeance and love, that stands for what he believes in, no matter the enemy. From a village rebellion to a full-scale war against the English, Mel Gibson's William Wallace captivates viewers to follow his journey for Scotland and inspires both the characters and the viewers outside of the film to fight for what they believe in. Watching this movie certainly did inspire me and the work which was done in both acting and capturing the emotion added up to a powerful story. Although many elements of the setting were uncontrollable and hard to manage, John Toll personally did a very good job at turning factors such as rain and natural lighting, into aspects that give the film more life. The overall tone of the movie was that of a burdensome nature. The gray sky and the rain did a really good job at weighing down and making the poor villages seem like they were even more disadvantaged. Starting from the beginning, you see this area that has clear signs of high precipitation. The movie itself takes of slowly, maybe too slowly for my taste, but soon after the story begins to move forward at a comfortable pace. John Toll portrayed this journey that William Wallace had with a very intense outlook. His high key lighting worked to enhance the details on the characters, the mud, the scratches, blood crusts, and cuts which they have. He chose to continue to shoot the film during unfavorable weather and whenever anything that would have been a setback to the camera presented itself, he simply would find ways to incorporate them into the movie and add more to the dramatic look. Although ambitions of John Toll, the issue with shooting everything in natural weather means that there were continuity issues regarding aspects like the rain and the lighting which had to be adjusted to it. Shooting in the rain limits the use of lights but the team did continue to try and run cables through the mud to help with the shots. Personally I believe that this is an inconvenience but it does go to show how invested John Toll was in having the shots be how he envisioned them. Other issues were minimal, although towards the end of the movie scenes like the battle scenes were never perfectly in focus due to the fact that characters were moving about everywhere in a non determined way. It is not that easy to notice but when looking through a critical lens, it is something that should have been adjusted. Overall the movie was great, I really did enjoy it. I felt inspired and passionate after having watched it. The mood and the characters were portrayed to perfection thanks to John Toll's good work as the cinematographer.

And as Braveheart, Gibson plays his role with flamboyance, and cuts it with sly humor. He is an amazing battlefield strategist, inventing new strategies and weapons, outsmarting the English at every turn, leading his men into battle with his face painted blue, like a football fan. There is a scene where he is so pumped up with the scent of battle that his nostrils flare; not many actors could get away with that, but Gibson can.",

I've watched it numerous time and it never fails to captivate me. The beautiful landscapes, breathtaking cinematography, well choreographed battle sequences, and inspiring dialogue all combine for maximum dramatic impact. These are the things that keep me coming back to Braveheart.",
1113,22 November 2003,Machival,10, One of my all time favorites,"Some movies one can see over and over, and they feel as if they're just as enticing as the first time you've watched it. Braveheart remains one of these movies. The movie directed by Mel Gibson, Braveheart (1995), depicts a humble clansman, William Wallace, determined to free Scotland from the English rule. William Wallace, played by Mel Gibson, lost his father and wife, Murron MacClannough, as a result of the harsh English ruler, King Edward, and his inhumane laws. In addition, William Wallace's tragic loss of his ""hidden bride"" remains the result of him trying to protect her from the English Law, Prima Nocte, which allows a lord the right to have sex with the ""bride"" before her wedding night. As Wallace rebels against the English, he becomes a very well-known figure among others. As many people stand behind the remarkable William Wallace, he and his people truly express ""the heart of Scotland"" as they defy against all odds, but of course there remains enemies. Braveheart exemplifies an excellent film based on the following aspects: acting, cinematography, plot, soundtrack, setting, and theme. The well-known actor, Mel Gibson, appears in many films, but much of his success comes from his ability to perform a serious, strong-willed part exceptionally; moreover, in this film he does not come short of successfully playing the role of William Wallace. Mel Gibson plays the part of a Scottish knight whom becomes one of the most influential figures in the battles leading up to obtaining Scotland's independence from English rule, and he appears more than natural as he acts the part. In the scene where William tracks down the men who sabotaged him, he takes off the one man's gear prepared to kill whomever is underneath it; however, he discovers Robert the Bruce, the man who gave him his word to stand behind Scotland. As a result, William's facial expressions portray surprise and betrayal. Mel Gibson acts proficiently in this scene because his reactions depict natural behavior since this type of disloyalty demonstrated a look any individual would also obtain. Although Mel Gibson stars as the main character in the film, other actors such as Angus Macfadyen also exemplified exceptional acting. Reverting back to the previous scene, Angus plays the character Robert the Bruce, and after he realized William discovered he sabotaged him, his reactions demonstrated shame, remorse, and guilt realistically. In addition, Braveheart exemplified outstanding cinematography. Often times, action movies neglect to focus the camera in the appropriate angles, and this takes away from the audience's ability to understand what's going on and why it's going on. In the scene where William's wife, Murron, fought the English lords whom were attempting to rape her, the camera was focused in all the correct places, so the audience knew the whereabouts of both William and Murron; furthermore, if the audience had not been provided with William's information as well, we would dread on the fact he was unable to save her the entire movie. Moreover, a still, focused camera is essential in action movies because it remains too difficult to follow the action in a movie when one can hardly follow the camera. That being said, this action-packed film maintained a steady camera in every scene, even on the battlefield. In order for a movie to leave an impression, the plot must be organized and unique. Braveheart remains a particularly unique movie because it illustrates a true historical event. The historical event in which this film follows portrays the time period between the late-1200's to mid-1300's where a devoted Scottish man, William Wallace, persisted in gaining Scotland's independence, and breaking free from England and it's tyrannical ruler, King Edward. In order to capture the audience's attention, the movie adds a twist by providing incentive to William's actions. Braveheart correctly exemplifies a well-organized plot by following the events, such as battles, true to history, and through cause-effect then chronological order; for example, the death of William's wife caused his rebellion, and battle by battle Scotland got closer and closer to gaining their freedom. Often times, people neglect to recognize the power a movie's soundtrack withholds. In Braveheart, the music does a remarkable job in enhancing each scene. First of all, when Murron's burial takes place, bagpipes begin to play, and the well-known Scottish music for death remains the only thing the audience hears; moreover, this music effectively evokes the audience's emotions by representing grief, loss, and gloom. In addition, the music in this movie mimics Scottish culture which enhances the historical significance of the movie; thus, Scottish folk music and Scottish funeral music not only stand as an imperative tune for the events that take place, but they also solidify Scotland's significance and heart. The setting of Braveheart suitably matches the context in which the story's told. Scotland and Ireland remain the region where the filming for this movie took place; likewise, the movie's historical significance and plot reflect that of Scotland's and Ireland's province. In addition, the costuming of the actors and actresses imitate visually how the people of Scotland, lords of England, and military gear one would have worn in the late-1200's to mid-1300's. Additionally, Braveheart depicts a theme. Without a film conveying a purpose and underlying message, the film essentially has no meaning; nevertheless, throughout Braveheart we repeatedly see the same idea reappearing, freedom. The theme seems quite obvious considering how the ""heart of Scotland"" and bravery of William Wallace stems from one motivation, gaining Scotland's independence. However, it's not until the end of the film when William Wallace receives unbearable pain, yet still manages to scream ""FREEDOM. FREEDOM. FREEDOM"" while his organs are being torn from his body in a gruesome punishment ritual known as purification. The movie, Braveheart, demonstrates an excellent film regarding every aspect a superb film obtains. The acting, cinematography, plot, soundtrack, setting, and theme go beyond what most films encompass, making it one of those movies that never get old. Needless to say, Braveheart deserved the felicitations it received.",
1114,21 June 2016,cammiefarella,10, Why its a good movie.,"Classic Hollywood-American mojo, historically inaccurate (my apologies to the scots and the brits), but I can suspend my disbelief and I can be entertained. But Mel Gibson is a racist pig and I really can't stand his guts, but I can at least appreciate the movie in its entirety was a decent attempt.",
1115,18 October 2006,jenerik,6, Hollywoodized,"Sad to say, this very entertaining film was treated with derision by the Scottish media, who, by and large have a psychotic aversion to anything resembling success or good news!",
1116,15 April 2004,don_hunter,8, Not so well received in Scotland.,It is true that this film can grate if you love or study history cos its way off the mark!! However as a stirring film that leaves you feeling that you just watched something brilliant it is right up there with the best. I am a huge Mel Gibson fan anyway so am probably somewhat biased but even so this deserves its its critical acclaim. Watching movies sometimes means leaving all your ideas at the door to get into it and this falls in to that category. I think as a loyal Scot I might be hopping mad and as a loyal Brit I was a bit peeved but then I was watching a movie not a history lesson so let it be!! Gibsons other film The Patriot distorts history in an even bigger way but again it is good entertainment and nothing more.,
1117,27 August 2005,Banray5,8, In spite of all historical errors,"Today I've seen Braveheart, a movie that has won 5 Oscars in 1996, for the first time. My judgment? It's a good movie, but I've seen much better movies! This movie is full of typical moments: a man who's wife is killed and wants revenge. He becomes a great leader with many warriors and keeps great speeches... The only real scene that belongs in a classic is the scene where William becomes tortured! I also think that the movie would be better if he was an hour shorter. On certain moments the film is really boring! The soundtrack is phenomenal. I love the music that James Horner had made for this movie!! Conclusion: a good historical epos, much better than Troy (Troy sucks) but not so good as Gladiator or war movies as The thin red line or Saving Private Ryan!",
1118,17 June 2005,verheyen_geer,6," good, but no classic!","As a huge Game of Thrones and Harry Potter fan, it was a true privilege to watch this film. From both the film series I listed to this movie, love seems to be a big motivation in the storyline(s). I don't think I've ever seen a movie tie in a revolution to a love story like I did last night when I saw Braveheart for the first time. Lets not also forget the amazing supporting cast in Tommy Flanagan (Sons of Anarchy), Brendan Gleeson (Harry Potter) and James Cosmo (Game of Thrones). Superb performance from all. The Scottish countrysides, castles, old-English war garments and Highlander bagpipes put together an authentic and historical plot that proves the magic that Mel Gibson can work. If you're going to see any movie, this is the one to see for its storyline, passion, music and beautiful shots. Couldn't imagine what this world would be like if this movie wasn't made.",

Those who criticize the movie for its historical inaccuracies have some good and accurate points. However, the time period depicted in this movie has very little in way of pure historical facts, just what the victors wrote after battle. Therefore, it is tough to judge any historical fact at this time (with a truly deciding what is correct)...especially when they were the enemies of the English. As the movie's opening lines say, ""I shall tell you, of William Wallace. Historians from England will say I am a liar, but history is written by those who have hanged heroes.""

The story is brilliantly told and has some magnificent battle scenes.The feeling you get when Wallace gets revenge on the person who took the life of someone dear to him, is phenomenal and there are moments like these all throughout the film. The scenery is absolutely brilliant and there is a decent enough score to go along with it. The movie is not entirely accurate however and leaves some important details out though it does not take away from the enjoyment of the film, unless of course accuracy in movies really matters to you. So overall it is a very decent film worthy of its title of Best Picture and a very good movie from Mel Gibson who also directed the recent ""The Passion of the Christ"". A must see.",

The movie has a great number of fairly-famous people throughout the entire 3 hours.  Arygle, played by Brian Cox, has been made famous for this movie.  And many other people, some turning out to be no-names and others becoming famous from this movie.  Moreover, this movie has great cast, storyline and setting.

The acting is just superb by not only Mel Gibson, but also by his Scottish wife (Murron) who was murdered, LongShanks the pagan, the beautiful French queen (Isabelle), as well as William's sidekicks (Irish, Hamish)) throughout the movie. Not only do we get a feel for life under British colonial rule we see the relationships developed through this fight for freedom and equality.

This is a three hour epic, that had a lot of poignant, and pivotal moments in it, but you are left with these wonderful, and heart felt phrases that will echo in your mind forever.......I won't spit out every notable phrase, but they are so powerful and moving, that it's hard not to feel compelled for William Wallace, among others.",

Humor, sadness, anger, and sometimes even twists are just parts of this movie that you will love. This is also partly true because William Wallace really was a real leader.

Mel Gibson is simply irritating as William Wallace and, although the battle sequences are undeniably awesome, the majority of the film is far too drawn out and the ridiculous run time makes it difficult to maintain concentration throughout. I did enjoy the film immensely but I have given it such a low rating due to its wasted potential to be like some of my favourite films of all time, and despite only being from 1995 it already feels incredibly dated like a film from the eighties or even seventies may.

1154,6 April 2006,standablaze,7, Fact or fiction,"Frist of all, let me be clear about the fact that l did enjoy Braveheart a lot, And l would have to put it in as one of my all time favourites. However it does not mean that l ignore the historical inaccuracies of the film. And reading many of the reviews on this site, it is clear that many people seem to gain their grasp of history from films and television and not from the facts as we know them. So l will try to help a few of you out there. This is what l had manged to find out about William Wallace after being inspired by the film. Both my parents are Scot's and often spoke to me about Wallace long before any film. It appears to many Scot's (like my parents) that Wallace continues to be an inspiration for an independent 'Scotland' and his struggle (like all for Freedom) captures the hearts of many. But most Scot's that l know, my parents included, have no real desire to be independent of England, in fact the UK has always been stronger united than separate. Wallace's inspirational achievements may well be greater than his actual achievements and this could be his greatest legacy. So some facts. 1. Wallace was born into what was believed to be a minor 'noble' family - a sort of 'county gentleman' not a Lord. However recent evidence suggests he was a game keeper or professional tracker or hunter - but certainly of lower class then previously believed. He was a lowlander! 2.Scotland and England at been at peace for over 100 years until the death of the Scotish King, Edward the 1st of England then tried to put a 'puppet' king on the throne of Scotland. Scotland said no and England invaded - Edward removed the puppet King and claimed the throne of Scotland for himself. 3. There is little known about Wallace's life before this time, but what evidence we have suggest's he was already an 'outlaw'; but seems that he did try and fight the English when ever he could after Edward took the throne of Scotland. 4. Wallace's actions seemed to be a rallying cry for many Scot's and his numbers grew - encouraged by the the Church he openly targeted English forces and administration centres. 5. At the Same time a Scotish Knight called Andrew Mornay began actions in the north of Scotland ( forces you see in the film that come down to join Wallace at the Battle of Stirling) 6. Wallace did have a wife or lover killed by the English and he did Kill the English Commander of Lanark in response ( We know this because at his trail it was one of the only recorded actions of Wallace's that was mentioned and we have documents about) 7. The Battle of Stirling was fought over a Bridge, not on an open field. 8.Wallace did invade England but not as far as York (as shownin the film) 9. He never had a relationship with the Princess of Wales as she would have only been about 4 years old at the time. 10. Wallace lost the battle of Falkirk due to the power of the English longbow and his own cavalry fleeing. (shown in the film) - however Falkirk was the first time during the middle ages that heavy cavalry had been stopped by foot soldiers. 11. Wallce went to France for several years - returned and after a few small actions was captured and killed as shown in the film; but did not shout FREEDOM at his death - sorry to say. 12. Robert the Bruce was never at Falkirk - he was 50 miles away. 13. Edward the 1st died a number of years later after Wallace, not at the same time. 14. Wallace has believed to be about 6'7"" tall and could have been as young as 20 to 24 at the Battle of Stirling.",

They are beautiful- well, as beautiful as a medieval era, gore filled epic can possibly be. What seems particularly realistic is the scene where the English Heavy Cavalry charge into the Scottish phalanx. The paradox to this are the moments when the film has been speeded-up in post production- the sight of the kilted Scots charging at speeds beyond human capabilities is one of the daftest moments of the film. Secondly, English King Edward I (Patrick McGoohan) is correctly depicted as utterly ruthless, and McGoohan is perfect for the role. Despite the fact the monarch is the films villain- who allowed local Lords to become bedfellows of newlywed women apparently- I cannot help but admire King Edward. His pre-Falkirk line saying ""Not the archers...arrows cost money. Use up the Irish: the dead cost nothing"" sums up this brilliant character perfectly. Hats off to the writers for that one.

Mel Gibson's direction is excellent especially in the brilliantly staged battle scenes(which quite literally took my breath away). For a film that was almost 3 hours long, it didn't feel like half that length as there was always something there was always something there to keep your interest.  The acting was also superb, not only from the main leads, but also from supporting cast (most notably Brendan Gleeson as the fearless Hamish).

In fact, the narrator explains to how the story began and he shows the characters. In my opinion, I think it a good idea to do this description because we can already understand the goal of the story. Then, we can see the main character who is William Wallace when he was a child, ans a few minutes later, we see William Wallace but when he is an adult. I think it is too a good think because the narrator concentrates on the action in the film ans this allows us to see the evolution of the principal character. The beginning of the film Braveheart, is interesting until here. Also, the colors are dark and cold. But after, there is an image when we can see many of character hanged. This image shocked me. And then, we can see Wallace and his army ready to the war. From then, the film becomes violent ans for me it is a negative point. This may be negative in particular for the children who watch the film. To conclude, for me, I don't like the theme of the film and actor's role aren't highlighted.

And as I said it isn't a historical movie when you know all the mistakes like: the Scottish didn't wear kilts at this time, some fights in the film are invented, they went too far on a point: the Prima Noctis; Lords didn't really used it), and many others. So if you wanted to know about the history of Scotland, you shouldn't watch this movie, if you want to know the basis maybe but be careful. The love story between the princess of England and Wallace is really really too much and another big mistake in a historical way. Some people say it was annoying as a movie but I didn't think it was as annoying as they think, some scenes are interesting. And I thought the King of England and Robert the Bruce are two great characters, these two actors make a good job !

It was very difficult to find motivation... After all, it was great! I appreciate this movie a lot in spite of a few drawbacks. I adore the medieval style with castles, knights, etc... so i very appreciate this movie for that, but i think that, the battles between SCots and English were too gory with too many details and too much blood and violence, but it's very realistic, so it's a good point! I have also appreciated the little scenes of fair between villagers when Wallace goes back in his old village. I have adored the enthusiasm and the motivation that Wallace gives to his soldiers when they have to fight against the English who are too many for them, and they want to go back home for staying alive. At this moment, Wallace shows his bravery and courage and says to them to fight in the name of liberty! Finally, i can say that i very appreciate this movie, in spite of it too long length!!",

They play their part very well and there is a real effort for the costumes. The fights don't surprises me : it's cool, but not impressive. The best for me is the camera : between zoom, traveling and the rest, I think the cameraman did a great work ! Without forgetting scriptwriter, who has my respect : to change several things to have the story that he wants, I think it's a great idea ! I want to do the same thing (maybe with Jeanne d'Arc) ! I think I will forget the story and characters, because this movie doesn't touch me. But there are a lot of good ideas which can be used for, maybe, a re-adaptation. With today's technology, a better movie can be produced. And maybe a new scriptwriter will still change the script. Who knows ?

Of course, you cannot get it all right - and some things have to be adjusted to please audiences and keep a red thread and in order to make a great film.

What's the point of the intimate relationship between the future Princess of Wales and Wallace? Seeing as she was just a little girl at the time it doesn't make much sense to invent this relationship. And the sacking of York - what's the purpose of inventing this?

I've watched it 3 times and there are still some scenes that I don't understand. Anyway, the actors, for example, are really competent, it seems that it really happened this way, that we are at Wallace's time and we see him live.

In this film, William Wallace is the hero, he defends the Scottish, he wants freedom for himself and for the Scots. I liked this movie but I thought that it was too violent and that too many details were shown. In spite of Mel Gibson, who is William Wallace in the movie, he is not Scottish, he took a very good accent to imitate the Scottish. At a moment, a part of Bravehart was so incomprehensible for me. But at the end, I understood. Bravehart is a synonym of courage. When William Wallace was killed, to take his revenge, his troops set off another war against the English. So, I'm going to stop now for the summary because I'll be able to tell you all the movie... HAHAHA... So personally, I find this movie great, the director has done a good job. The actors allowed us to immerse ourselves completely in the film, it was incredible. Now, Braveheart is one of the favourite movies that I have seen despite the excess of violence there was.

I have been mad at what people have said about #5 Gladiator and how its story is terrible.  First of all I feel that it isn't that bad but it's no #3 Casablanca either.  I watch certain movies for certain things.  Casablanca and #6 Citizen Kane rely on how good their screenplays are because they don't have any spectacle.  Gladiator is being judged on its story, that is like judging Casablanca for its spectacle, it wouldn't be that good.  Gladiator relies on its spectacle and Casablanca relies on it's story but when a movie combines one of the greatest screenplays ever written with the best spectacle ever you get the best movie ever BRAVEHEART.  It has some great performances especially by Mel Gibson. This movie also has some of the best cinematography, editing, costumes, and art direction ever.  Plus the best, the BEST, score ever.  I would watch the movie just to listen to the music it is absolutly beautiful.  Randall Wallace wrote one of the best scripts ever and Mel directed it wonderfully. It also has some of the most famous scenes in movie history such as the speech before the battle of Stirling, the battle of Stirling, and the famous ending were he shouts FREEDOM.  This is a very rare movie, it's even romantic and has some funny parts, it combines a Casablanca like script and Gladiator spectacle, although without Braveheart, Gladiator probably would never had been made.  This is a MUST see for any movie fan, you haven't seen a movie till you have seen Braveheart.  This is one of the 6 movies that I have ever given my highest rating were I am so impressed I give it another star.  Braveheart, The Godfather, Casablanca, Schindler's List, Gladiator, and Citizen Kane, all 5/4 stars.  Braveheart is my #1 out of 100 and will probably never be beat because that movie would have to be better written than the Godfather and have better battle scenes than Braveheart which I don't think will happen.",
