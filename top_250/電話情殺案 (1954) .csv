0,4 September 2010,Lejink,7, M for masterful,"A treat for the eyes and exercise for the brain, ""Dial M For Murder"" is Hitchcock's second ""drawing-room perfect murder"" movie, after ""Rope"", the latter a darker and more sinister affair altogether. Hitchcock himself in interviews played down the quality of this movie, amongst other other things indicating that it was treated almost as a warm-up for the more ambitious ""Rear Window"" which immediately followed it in his career.",/
1,26 November 2012,TheUnknown837-1,9," The stage-originated dialogue sings with intelligence, wit, and an easy transition to the screen","There is a lot to admire about Alfred Hitchcock's ""Dial M for Murder,"" and I do hold the film with a great deal of admiration and respect. However, what I adore about the movie the most (more than the cinematography, the suspense, the acting, and even the direction) is the work by screenwriter Frederick Knott. Mr. Knott based the screenplay for ""Dial M for Murder"" on his successful stage production, which I have never seen, but am told contains almost all of the words we hear in the film. And the words are music to the ears. They sing with intelligence, wit that Mr. Hitchcock certainly found attractive, and, best of all, an easy transition to the screen. Many times when a stage production goes to film, as far as I am concerned, the results, even if good, are uneven. Frequently, the dialogue and restricted set space allowed tend to give off the impression of a filmed play, not a cinematic experience. Another Hitchcock film, 1948's ""Rope,"" though valiant, interesting, and successful, attempted this and suffered from this difficult struggle.",r
2,21 February 2007,jluis1984,9, The perfect film for the perfect murder...,"After earning an Academy award nomination for her performance in John Ford's 1953 tale of romance and adventure, ""Mogambo"", the beautiful actress Grace Kelly proved that she was way more than just a pretty face and that there was real talent behind her image. However, what truly took her career to new levels were three now classic films she made directed by the legendary Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. Under his direction, Kelly made an integral part of the Master's films, becoming the perfect embodiment of Hitchcock's idea of a female protagonist. While Kelly debuted two years earlier in the classic Western ""High Noon"", one could say that it was Hitchcock who really introduced the beauty and talent of Grace Kelly to the world. ""Dial M for Murder"" was the first of Hitchcock's films with Kelly, and a movie where once again the Master returns to a familiar theme: the perfect murder.",e
3,21 January 2013,Spondonman,8, Excellent,"What gets me about this film every time I see it is just how simple it is. The witty urbanity of the dialogue goes without saying (hem), the acting is stagily impeccable, and the direction by Hitchcock is limited by the small sets but masterful for all that.",v

Mark writes crime stories. Unbeknown to Margot and Mark, Tony knows about the affair, and wants to teach Margot a little lesson, by taking away the thing that is her life. But, being too guileful to do it himself, Wendice blackmails one of his old school friends into murdering her, and the essential thing to doing it is his latchkey.",i
5,21 June 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, Fantastic Hitchcock murder mystery,"Another excellent Hitchcock film, just one of the many that the director made which exceeded all my expectations. This murder mystery has a twist - we know the identity of the culprit from the start, it's just a question of waiting to see whether the cast work it out or not. The film takes place in a single location, a low key apartment, much like the Audrey Hepburn thriller WAIT UNTIL DARK. It's a slow paced and talky affair with an absolutely intricate plot that's likely to tie you up in circles if you don't watch it closely enough, but of course that's part of the fun.",e
6,19 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," Not Hitchcock's best, but definitely a film not to miss!","Alfred Hitchcock is a wonderful director, directing classics such as Psycho, North by Northwest and Rebecca. While not his best, Dial M For Murder has so much to recommend it. First of all, is the breathtaking cinematography, which is nearly always the best thing in a Hitchcock film. The script is a gem, showing that you are capable of anything, and most of the time, it is very tense and rarely slips. That said, my only complaint, is that one or two scenes such as the ending do fall flat, compared to the rest of the film. However, the film also has a wonderful music score, and fantastic performances from the entire cast. Ray Milland, an actor I really want to get more familiar with, is excellent as Tony Wendice, the husband planning to murder his wife, and make it a perfect murder. As Margot, the beautiful Grace Kelly is the picture of beauty and vulnerability in a wonderful understated performance, perhaps outshining her co-star. Everyone else acquitted themselves well too, even Robert Cummings as Mark Halliday and John Williams as Inspector Hubbard. Overall, an excellent film, not Hitchcock's best, but well looking out for. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",w
7,9 October 2011,ElMaruecan82,10, Hitchcock's perfect film of a non-perfect crime ...,"With ""Dial M For Murder"", the Master signs another classic of mystery, starring for the first time, the actress who'd become the quintessential Hitchcock blonde, Grace Kelly. And as much as I appreciated the much more acclaimed ""Rear Window"", I sincerely believe this is one of Hitchcock's finest achievements, which is saying a lot considering his glorious oeuvre, but ""Dial M for Murder"" takes a special place in my heart, because it represents for many reasons, the typical Hitchcockian film, by many standards.",/
8,4 July 2007,Galina_movie_fan,8," ""Do you really believe in the perfect murder? ""","The hit Broadway play by Frederick Knott ""Dial M for Murder"" has been adapted to the screen several times, including the films made in West Germany and Sweden, as well as a TV movie in 1981 (TV) by Boris Seagal and the film ""A Perfect Murder"" (1998) directed by Andrew Davis with Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Viggo Mortensen. Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 adaptation was the first and certainly the best one even if the master himself considered it one of his lesser efforts. ""Dial M for Murder"" will be remembered as Hitchcock's first color film and the first of three thrillers he had made with Grace Kelly, the future Princess of Monaco, in the prime of her beauty and her talent. Using color proved to be very effective in the film. The first two scenes featuring Kelly wearing a white morning dress in the idyllic scene with her husband Tony and right after that kissing passionately her American lover, writer (Robert Cummings) in the red dress, immediately, without many words tell the viewer that the story of passion, deception, betrayal, and ultimately, murder will follow.

Tony figures out what might have led his wife astray and fixes it - he gets a real job with a real boss. But what if his wife divorces him? He'd get nothing! Realizing that getting a job may have enlarged his wife's respect for him but not diminished her affection for the lover, he spends a large amount of time figuring out a perfect way to kill his wife so that he can inherit her money. Tony has nothing personal against Margot and her infidelity, he just can't take the chance of winding up penniless. He can't do the job himself - the husband is always the prime suspect in such matters. So, he must find someone who will be willing to do the job for him. He's not the type who hangs with organized crime types, so he has to find someone already guilty of murder but yet untouched by the law and get that person to agree to do the job for him.",w

Not a lagging moment. I was riveted to the, let's face it, preposterous plot from beginning to end. Ray Milland is a credible monster in elegant and civilized clothing. Grace Kelly, a peach as the unfaithful wife who stays home to cut newspaper clippings of her husband's past glories. Yeah, right. Robert Cummings has always been a mystery to me. A popular leading man with a long career. He only exudes a campy, if lightweight vibe that almost works in comedies and when he's in a supporting role - My Geisha and What A Way To Go with Shirley MacLaine are good examples. Here as Grace Kelly's secret lover, I don't know what to say.

12,15 September 1999,Chuck-149,9, One of Hitchcock's best thrillers.,"1954 was a big year for Grace Kelly.  She played in Hitchcock's classic ""Rear window"" and she won an Oscar for best actress in ""The country girl"" and most people tend to forget that she starred in yet another classic, ""Dial M for murder"".  Starring Grace Kelly, Ray Milland, and Robert Cummings, it is simply one of Hitchcock's finest movies of all-time.

15,21 July 2002,DennisLittrell,9, Superior Hitchcock with an exquisite Grace Kelly,"This is a fine example of the kind of mystery that little old ladies  from Pasadena (or Russell Square) adore. Perhaps Arsenic and Old Lace  (1944) starring Cary Grant might be comparable in its gentile and  bloodless ability to glue us to the screen.  This is certainly one of Hitchcock's best, but most of the credit must  go to a devilishly clever play written by Frederick Knott from which  the movie was adapted. (He also wrote Wait Until Dark (1967) starring  Audrey Hepburn.) Hitchcock does a good job in not tinkering  unnecessarily with the material. He also has the exquisitely beautiful  Grace Kelly to play the part of Margot Wendice.  Ray Milland plays, with a kind of high-toned Brit panache, her  diabolical husband, Tony Wendice, a one-time tennis star who married  mostly for security. John Williams is the prim and proper Chief  Inspector Hubbard. He lends to the part a bit of Sherlock Holmesian  flair. One especially liked his taking a moment to comb his mustache  after the case is solved. Robert Cummings, unfortunately plays Margot's  American boyfriend as inventively as a sawhorse. For those of you who  might have blinked, Hitchcock makes his traditional appearance in the  photo on the wall from Tony Wendice's undergraduate days.  The fulcrum of the plot is the latchkey. It is the clue that  (literally) unlocks the mystery. There is a modernized redoing of this  movie called A Perfect Murder (1998) starring Michael Douglas and  Gwyneth Paltrow in which a similar business with latchkeys is employed.  I am not very good with clues so it was only after seeing that movie  and Dial M for Murder for the second time that I finally understood  what happened. Follow the latchkey!  Of course I was too distracted by Grace Kelly to fully appreciate such  intricacies. I found myself struck with the ironic notion that anyone,  even a cuckolded husband, might want to kill Grace Kelly or that a jury  might find her guilty of anything! She remains in my psyche America's  fairytale princess who quit Hollywood at the height of her popularity  after only five years and eleven movies to become a real princess by  marrying Prince Rainier of Monaco. Something was lost there, and  something was gained. She was in essence the original Jackie Kennedy  Onassis. I think, however, that the old saw about the man who marries  for money, earning it, might apply to American princesses as well.  At any rate, Grace Kelly's cool and sublime bearing was on fine display  here. Hitchcock cloths her in discreet nightgowns and snug (but  certainly not clinging) dresses that show off her delicate figure and  her exquisite arms and hint oh so coyly at her subtle sexuality. She  was 25-years-old, stunningly beautiful, and in full confidence of her  ability as an actress. She had just finished starring opposite James  Stewart in another splendid Hitchcock one-room mystery, Rear Window  (1954), and was about to make The Country Girl (1954) with Bing Crosby  for which she would win an Oscar for Best Actress.  So see this for Grace Kelly who makes Gwyneth Paltrow (whom I adore)  look downright gawky, and for Ray Milland whose urbane scheming seems a  layer or two of hell removed from Michael Douglas's evil manipulations.  By the way, the ""original theatrical trailer"" preceding these Warner  Brothers Classic videos is what we used to call the ""Coming  Attractions""--that is, clips directly from the movie and a promo. You  might want to fast forward to the movie itself.",2

17,17 November 2008,Coventry,7, Nothing ever goes fully according to plan,"Hitchcock does Experimental Theatre  That's pretty much to most befitting description you could give to ""Dial M for Murder""; one of the Master of Suspense's most acclaimed but also  do I daresay it  most overrated achievements. The entire film takes place in one single location, as if you're watching a stage play, and there's also the experimental use of unusual camera angles and bizarre compositions, which proved that even the untouchable filmmakers like Hitchcock were attempting to be innovative in order to face the competition with the skyrocketing success of television during the early 50's. Personally, I have to admit I thought of ""Dial M for Murder"" as a very intelligent and competent but nevertheless severely underwhelming thriller experience. Every tiniest detail in this production is flawlessly taken care of, but the wholesome is just so damn lifeless! Every single character stands there talking as if they have a dozen of knives stuck in their backs and daren't move a muscle. Frederick Knott's screenplay is tight and highbrow, but since he adapted it from a stage play (his own), the movie is exaggeratedly talkative and the limited possibilities to switch sets rapidly makes it tedious as well, regardless of all the photography gimmicks.",/

25,28 April 2010,paul2001sw-1,3, Ridiculous - why is this considered great?,"SPOILER: There are many who believe that Alfred Hitchcock was a visionary genius; but personally, I fail to see the appeal in his films. I like some 1950s movies - those of Billy Wilder are great, but I find Hitchcock gets stiff performances from his casts, uses preposterous plots and in 'Dial M for Murder', there's a surprising absence of action - just a lot of talk. To summarise the story, a man plans an improbably complex murder; when the plan goes wrong, he frames his wife; but when his wife's friend and a sympathetic policeman get suspicious, they manage to trap him (albeit via the peculiar device of taking her from prison on the eve of her planned execution to help find the evidence to damn him and free her). He takes his capture with sang froid, and the film ends. I suppose Hitchcock was an original, in attempting to tell tales more complex than those previously attempted in cinema; but in an age of over-plotted and under-motivated thrillers, I wonder if his influence can be wholly considered good.",t

Except that it wasn't perfect, as mystery writer Mark Halliday himself opines - ""Well because in stories things usually turn out the way the author wants them to and in real life they don't, always.""

31,12 June 2017,robert-temple-1,8, Can Ray Milland get away with the perfect murder?,"Alfred Hitchcock loved shooting in studios, and here he had a film based upon a stage play, much of which could take place within a single set. Here he had every opportunity to show his perfect blonde doll in distress, as the impeccably sculpted Grace Kelly survives an attempt by her cold-hearted and jealous husband, Ray Milland, to have her murdered. But she doesn't know that he was behind the incident. Instead, she herself is convicted of the murder of her would-be murderer, by an evil irony, so that Hitchcock gets another crack at one of his favourite themes, the horrifying dilemma of the unjustly accused. It literally is a case of 'Will she hang tomorrow?' The play and the screenplay were both written by Frederick Knott (1916-2002), who did an excellent job of opening it out beyond a stage proscenium, aided of course by Hitchcock's relentless story-boarding and planning of a variety of shots in a single space which makes everything look like it is taking place in a wider context. This play was filmed no less than 14 times, starting with a TV play for the BBC in 1952. Hitchcock's film was merely the fourth filmed version. Somehow, the idea of someone dialling a phone number to trigger a murder attempt seems to have grabbed the public's imagination, and one can only describe 14 films in 46 years of the same play as 'a frenzy of film-making'. It was so popular in Germany that it was filmed twice there within only three years. Of course, the excitement only really works when all the phones are landlines. In the story, Grace Kelly had to stand in a specific position beside a curtain (which concealed the would-be murderer) in order to answer the phone, and dialling M for murder was the signal. It really was an 'M', by the way, because she was in London and her telephone number, for anyone who wants to try the same trick, was MAYFAIR 4399, which in those days before modern dialling codes, one reached by literally putting one's finger in a rotary dial, starting with the letter 'M', to dial MAY-4399. (I just tried dialling it and also the other number mentioned in the film, HAMPSTEAD 7899, adding the modern prefix '7', but neither number is connected. I suppose the shock of Hitchcock's film was too much for them.) To show just how the emphasis was on the attempt to commit the perfect murder, the last filming of the story in 1998 was actually entitled THE PERFECT MURDER, and starred Michael Douglas, who has just the right look in his eyes. In this version, Ray Milland's ice-cold and ultra-polite manner provided the necessary chill factor. Kelly's lover, Robert Cummings, features in the film but has little to do but look earnest and friendly. As for Grace Kelly, being an ice queen was somewhat contra-indicated, because she is simply not enough of a whimpering victim. Instead of being hopelessly distraught, she substitutes puzzlement and disbelief for true emotion. We therefore don't care that much about whether she is murdered or not, except for all that beauty going to waste, like destroying a Botticelli painting unnecessarily. We want to keep her on screen so we can look at her, that's all. What she feels about it all is irrelevant, because it is clear that she does not really feel anything. Ray Milland, as I have had occasion to say more than once, was notorious in the acting community for being obsessively mean with money. I never met him, but I knew some who worked with him, and his favourite trick in Manhattan when working on Broadway was to share a taxi with another actor and then at the end say he had forgotten his wallet. His higher up colleagues knew about this, but many a poor starving supporting actor was left with a huge taxi bill which he or she could not afford, and with a promise of repayment never kept. It was therefore never difficult for Ray Milland when acting to narrow his eyes and look self-obsessed, and let his inner lizard out. And the way he is continually taking his wallet out of his pocket and putting it back in again in this film, carefully minding the incriminating fingerprints of another man on a crucial letter and wearing gloves himself, is simply too reminiscent of his 'wallet problem' in real life. The story of this thriller is so ingenious, detailed, and complex that it is really a marvel of plot construction. And in this film, Hitchcock's personal appearance on screen takes the form of a wonderful joke, for he appears not in person this time but in a group photograph which features prominently in the story. Haha, good one, Hitch. And the best Hitchcockian touch of all is the final shot of the film.",

33,26 October 2016,oOoBarracuda,10," ""It's funny how you can tell when people are in love.""","Disclaimer: Dial M For Murder is my second favorite movie of all- time, but I will attempt to write an unbiased review of the film. In 1954, Alfred Hitchcock made what I believe to be a perfect film (that didn't take long) that he apparently thought nothing of. In the book Hitchcock, by the equally as brilliant Francois Truffaut, Hitch admits that he was playing it safe with this movie and didn't put much effort into it as wasn't especially invested. That was a bit of a buzzkill, considering what the movie means to me, however, whether he was trying too hard or not, Hitch made a great one with Dial M For Murder. Starring Ray Milland and Grace Kelly, Dial M For Murder explores the plot of a man desperate to murder the wife he finds out has been having an affair. An example of one of the most brilliant storytelling films I have ever seen, Dial M For Murder is cemented in the heart of this Hitchcock fan, whether he would like that or not.",

Characters talk and talk and talk, always indoors, in a drawing room, because it was written for the stage and Hitch couldn't be bothered to open it up. So it's unbearably claustrophobic.

Every successive interaction builds on the suspense generated by the previous one. Ray Milland is so conniving yet sympathetic enough that one almost hopes that he gets away with it. I wonder if Cary Grant, Gregory Peck, or Jimmy Stewart, three of Hitch's most prominent leading men were afraid of jeopardizing their image and thereby their box-office appeal by agreeing to play a villain. Grace Kelly doesn't have much to do here but she does her job admirably. It was a great year for her. I think she made Rear Window and The Country Girl, for which she won a best actress Oscar, the same year she made Dial M.

The ending is a bit stagey but Hitch milks it wonderfully and the whole business with the key is great. Milland is surprisingly effective particularly in the brilliantly written main scene with Anthony Dawson, which sets the whole thing in motion. Grace Kelly is fine and certainly seems much more worth all the effort than the slight Gwyneth in the recent remake.

I am most disappointed by the lack of depth in the Grace Kelly and Cummings characters, which are both one-note uninteresting roles. Grace Kelly is wasted in a passive, weak, and vapid role which relegates her to the status of window dressing (not that there is anything wrong with that!), she might as well be a nice looking piece of furniture in this movie. The Cummings role is wasted as the passion between him and Kelly is not developed, and amazingly, the tension that would exist between Milland and Cummings is never apparent!. This guy was sleeping with Milland's wife, but you would think they were best friends. What a waste. Would have been a lot more interesting if Kelly and Cummings were not such bland, cardboard harmless people and were a little more human, with real emotions (jealousy, hatred, passion, even a little evil).",

Hitchcock was not a perfectionist in the sense that he was a refined, nitpicky gentleman of poise. He was in fact a shameless attention hog with a snooty English comportment. The perfectionism in his film-making comes from the same place that generates his never-ending need to appear on his own TV show, interviews, at some point at any cost during each and every one of his movies (this time, due to the story's confined setting, in a black-and-white reunion photograph), and even as the on-screen guide in the trailers of his later movies: An inexhaustible pride on his accomplishments, pure and obsessive joy taken by his prolific mastery of a challenging cinematic effect, suspense. This approach to perfectionism meets halfway with writer Frederick Knott's mature and controlled perfectionism. Knott details a rigid, clockwork scenario upon which Hitchcock magnifies just how inspired Knott's script is.",

56,3 December 2002,telegonus,9, Theatre Piece,"A simple murder story about an aging tennis player who's plotting to have his wife murdered, Dial M For Murder was adapted from a popular play by Fredrick Knott, and while expertly directed by Alfred Hitchcock, one senses that the man's heart isn't in it. There's certainly no heart in the material. As a vehicle for stars Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings, it works well enough. Milland, in his last major hit as a star, is icy and convincing as the villain. Kelly was never a great actress, but is a pleasure to behold. She's well cast as the victim, though I can't resist the notion that any man who, however desperate, would seek to have her killed is not merely of the criminal bent but just plain bent. Cummings is bland in thankless support, yet his amiable disposition and general familiarity are somehow pleasing. John Williams, as a droll police inspector, steals every scene he's in, and became somewhat of a ""name"" for a while as a result. The movie is watchable, and hard not to get involved with once the plot starts to hum, yet it never shifts into high gear, due mostly to its theatrical origin. Hitchcock keeps the temperature cool throughout.",
57,31 March 2002,HarryHart,3, Key Swapping Balderdash (Spoiler),"I must admit that I scanned through all the comments on this film hoping that someone somewhere might agree with my assessment of the plot as being absurdly overcomplicated. Surely it was relatively straightforward to get an extra key cut even in the 1950s, which would have stopped all the ridiculous key swapping activities. At times, it seemed more like a magician's (con man's?) act - now you see it, now you don't - rather than a mystery/thriller. I thought it was quaint that the local police were called instead of the emergency services when there is a dead body in the apartment.  Perhaps we had the ethos of your local, friendly neighbourhood cop on the beat in those days who would clear it all up quite amicably and we could all get on with our lives, and perhaps be more careful in future. Not only are keys swapped with gay abandon but also raincoats (unnoticed, of course). Not at all sure why the crime-writer boyfriend of the wife agreed to go to a stag night with the husband, just after he had admitted that he would find it very difficult talking to the bloke, who he hardly knew anyway.

61,6 June 2015,JohnHowardReid,8, Has some plot problems but it's still a must-see movie!,"Alas, the 3-D version seems to have disappeared, although one does hear rumors of its screening at special events from time to time. Hitch took great care to ensure that the 3-D effects enhanced the story rather prove a distraction. To this end, he asked Fred Knott to write three or four minutes of inconsequential, introductory dialogue so that movie audiences would get used to the effects produced by the 3-D cameras and could then focus their attention on the plot and the dialogue. He also reasoned that the major effects, particularly the sequence with the scissors would come across far more dramatically if they had a visual element of surprise. When viewing the movie in its flat version, one wonders why the devil Knott is marking time when the curtains part and doesn't get on with the plot. My original theory was that he wanted to accommodate latecomers, but that isn't the case at all. Hitch simply wanted audiences to settle down, so that he could spring a few 3-D surprises later on, such as the all-important scissors scene. On the acting side of the movie, Milland, Kelly and Dawson walk away with the honors. To my mind, Williams' performance is somewhat odd. I know police detectives are supposed to impassive – especially British police detectives – but to my mind, Williams overdoes the impassivity. In fact, he simply repeats his stage performance and makes no effort whatever to cater for a movie audience – except, of course, to lower his voice. Because Williams is so impassive, it's possible to notice several gaping holes in the plot, which a more colorful performance could have disguised. All in all, though, despite the shortcomings of the flat version, Dial M for Murder is still a must-see movie. Available on a superb Warner Brothers DVD.",

That his wife is involved in an extramarital affair means little to him as he sets into motion his plan that eventually unravels due to dogged detective work. As with most murder mysteries, money is the reason Milland wants to dispatch Kelly and enlists the help of an outsider to do the dirty work. John Williams is the droll inspector who takes the case apart and puts it back together with logic and old fashioned police sleuthing. The film has a parallel with another Hitchcock film, ""Rope"", in that both pictures were filmed almost entirely with one set piece. Still, this mystery remains one of the genre's best films.",

64,25 May 2021,nickenchuggets,9," Pretty confusing, but still worth it","In a review I did on Hitchcock's 1948 movie Rope, I stated that nobody can deliver a suspense movie like him, and once again, he proves the validity of this sentence. Dial M for Murder is a film that has been praised for over 60 years, and it isn't hard to see why. Hitchcock knows which elements to use in his story to tell a convincing and engaging one. The movie is about a guy named Tony played by Ray Milland who is married to a wealthy woman named Margot (Grace Kelly) who, unbeknownst to her husband, was going out with a writer named Mark for a while. Once Tony discovers this, he decides to formulate
a plan to kill his cheating wife, and her huge amount of money definitely catches his attention as well. Tony wants an old college friend of his to commit the crime for him, and blackmails him into doing so since his friend already has a criminal record. Meanwhile, the plan is put into effect. Mark and Tony plan to go to a party, which leaves Margot at home alone and vulnerable to attack. At 11 o clock at night exactly, Tony will call her from his party and his college friend must choke her to death as she goes to answer the phone. He will then leave and make the whole thing look like a burglary. However, things don't
go as planned and Margot manages to stab her assailant to death with scissors as her husband tries calling her. Tony is now in serious trouble since his wife is supposed to be dead by now but she managed to foil the plan. This is where the movie becomes very confusing in my opinion, but basically what happens is Margot manages to get herself incriminated by making several conflicting statements to a police investigator about how Tony's friend was blackmailing her. She is found guilty and sentenced to be executed. Thankfully it all works out in the end, since Tony is eventually found guilty on the grounds that
he bribed his college friend to murder his wife, and this theory is later confirmed when Mark finds a briefcase filled with money. Margot escapes the noose and Tony is rightfully found guilty. The movie is similar to Rope in many ways, mainly the fact that it takes place mostly in one room and a character who knows he is guilty of something eventually gets proved guilty at the end. I would say they're about the same in terms of quality.",

In her first teaming with The Master, Grace Kelly portrays a wealthy woman married to a fading tennis pro (Ray Milliand), who wants her murdered, because he knows of her affair with an American writer (Robert Cummings). Nicely shot in color, with a robust musical score, the picture was designed for 3-D, and the effects are quite minimal until the attempted murder scene, by a hired thug (Anthony Dawson). Later, due to Milland's interfering, Kelly becomes the accused, until a savvy detective (John Williams) unravels the case. Ray Milland is again simply superb, reciting fine dialog with great relish, while Kelly is startling beautiful and polished, until things begin to go awry....her hair and clothes become drabber. Stagy, mostly in one indoor set, even the outdoor London sets seem projection-oriented, but always gripping, fascinating, and nerve-wracking.",

Tony is quite jealous, but as an ex-professional tennis player no longer able to play, he needs Margot's money to sustain his lifestyle. So he decides to murder her, and concocts an elaborate plot to make it look like a burglary-murder. The plan seems foolproof, but its execution proves this a wrong assumption.",
95,6 September 2005,jboothmillard,6, Dial M for Murder,"Sir Alfred Hitchcock was one of the greatest directors that ever lived, but for some reason some people don't think this film is one of his best, I think its good. Its a good story about deception, suspicion and pure greed. Ray Milland plays the sneaky and quite bastard like husband Tony Wendice. He is married to Margot Mary (BAFTA nominated Grace Kelly). Tony has talked to an old school friend and planned a robbery for this ""friend"" to do in his house, for some reason. When the robbery goes wrong and Tony's friend is killed by his panicking wife, she is suspected of murder. (Coincidently when he calls her he dials the letter M, hence the title). Luckily in the end Tony gets what he deserves when the cops suspect him of deception. Hitchcock's cameo is on the left side in the class-reunion photo. It was number 48 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills.

97,16 July 2006,barnabyrudge,7," Stagebound Hitchcock thriller with flashes of ingenuity, strong performances, and good suspense.","It is absolutely incredible when one reflects on the fact that Alfred Hitchcock made Dial M For Murder purely to fulfil his contractual obligations to Warner studios, and considered the film to be an effortless work that required little of him. He joked on several occasions that he could have ""phoned-in"" his direction (a clever little joke, as the film's most impressive suspense sequence involves Ray Milland ""phoning-in"" to his wife Grace Kelly in order to distract her while a murderer creeps up on her). The reason I say Hitchcock's casual attitude about the film is absolutely incredible is that it remains a very powerful and suspenseful film. How many lesser directors have expended every shred of energy on a film, only for it to be met with indifference or derision by the public and the critics? Yet here we have Hitchcock admitting that he has been neither meticulous nor ambitious in the making of his film, and has still produced something better than what most people could have done!! Such genius is at once arrogant and wonderful! ",

99,19 September 2010,moonspinner55,6, Plush murder-game courtesy Alfred Hitchcock...though stagy and in a minor key,"Champion tennis player--retired and married to a wealthy, unfaithful blonde dish--arranges to have his spouse murdered, never dreaming of course she would fight back against her attacker, leaving the unruffled rotter to match wits with the savvy police inspector on the case. Frederick Knott adapted his own successful play, though neither he nor director Alfred Hitchcock made much of an attempt to open up the material for the screen. Instead of exploiting all the possibilities for a decadent danse macabre, the material is kept in-check; it finally seems stunted, or rather stultifying. Cinematographer Robert Burks gives the proceedings a nice coat of gloss, and Grace Kelly is attractive (though one-note) as the wife of scheming Ray Milland. John Williams, recreating his Tony-winning stage role as the Chief Inspector, out-acts them both. It passes the time painlessly, but is never more than a compact drawing-room mystery. **1/2 from ****",
100,7 May 2020,kevinolzak,9, Hitchcock's sole venture into 3-D remains a fascinating artifact,"That Frederick Knott's 1952 play ""Dial M for Murder"" should be chosen for Alfred Hitchcock's only venture into 3-D proved to be advantageous for the author, as there are only four main characters seen on screen, the rest being policemen, and really only one major set required, quite a challenge for anyone else to undertake. Warners was insistent that shooting be done in Natural Vision's two projector 3-D process, though few screenings could be viewed that way, the fad having died out in little more than two years. Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is a recently retired tennis player who has deviously been plotting the demise of his wealthy wife Margot (Grace Kelly) for a year, ever since he learned of her dalliance with American mystery writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings), expertly luring an old college chum who has fallen on hard times as the perfect patsy to commit the crime. Charles Swann (Anthony Dawson) is aghast that Wendice has gone to so much trouble to ensnare him in this web but, comforted by the prospect of easy money for a few minutes work, uses the latchkey hidden in the stairwell to secretly enter the apartment, then wait behind a curtain to strangle his victim from behind after she exits the bedroom to answer her husband's telephone call. From his end of the line Tony hears the sounds of a struggle only to be stunned to hear his wife confess to killing her unknown assailant, requesting that she not phone the police until he gets home. In carefully laying the groundwork to have Margot arrested for murdering a blackmailer (the incriminating love letter placed in the dead man's pocket by Tony), the husband is able to get by watching his wife undergo a swift trial and conviction, while Scotland Yard's wily Chief Inspector Hubbard (John Williams) keeps track of his spendthrift ways, using the cash intended for Swann had he carried out his task. Ray Milland was perhaps a bit old to be playing a retired tennis pro but he's absolutely sensational in a tricky part, constantly on screen and having to cope on the fly when his meticulous plans unexpectedly go awry. In such capable hands the talky proceedings never grow boring, and repeating their Broadway roles for the screen were John Williams, one of Hitchcock's favorite actors, and Anthony Dawson, also remembered as the wicked Marquis in Hammer's ""The Curse of the Werewolf"" from 1961, and devious Professor Dent in ""Dr. No,"" the very first James Bond feature.",
101,25 June 1999,Liedzeit,10, Gets better with each watching,"Everyone loves Hitchcock. This one is my favorite. ""Rear Window"" and objectively speaking probably half a dozen others are better but this film is for me. Ray Milland plays a tennis player in the cruel old days when it was not good enough to be good at something. His wife got the money. Grace Kelly did not need much acting talent to play a boring woman but this is not why Ray wants to get rid of her. She falls in love with another man - Ray Cummings of all people. This casting is of course the reason why this film works. We are supposed to sympathize with the greedy husband and at the same time the wife has to be an angel. Very difficult but Hitchcock succeeds. And mainly because we cannot forgive her for even thinking of giving up her husband for a man like him. Still, at the crucial time when she is about to be strangled our sympathies shift to her. We want her to reach the scissors.",
102,21 May 2005,gftbiloxi,7, Expertly Made But Decidedly Minor,"Although Hitchcock's version of the popular play was considered a shocker in its day, repetition of the story in so many versions has made the story itself seem rather tame: a husband, angered by his wife's affair and in desperate need of money, blackmails an acquaintance to murder her--but his plans go awry when his wife kills her attacker in self-defense.",
103,8 May 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8, Suspense is the name of the game and it oozes from every scene.,"Suspense is the name of the game in 'Dial M For Murder (1954)' and it is dealt out in spades, each scene oozing it to the point where this stage-play adaptation is practically busting at the seams with the anticipatory, string-dangling stuff. While there's a lot of talking and expository dialogue, that's simply because of the single location and the commitment to stick to it - aside from a few asides in a single scene where cutaways are necessary to enhance the plot and, more importantly, the tension - while also just 'shooting the material', as Hitchcock put it, so as not to 'ruin' what was already a captivating and clever source story. 'Just shooting' is to Hitchcock what 'working for a lifetime to achieve a mastery of your craft' is to anybody else, though. Indeed, it is well known that this wasn't one of Hitchcock's favourites and that the studio essentially forced him to do it. He once said, to a room full of journalists, that he could've ""phoned it in."" This was almost certainly said in irony but I don't know what's worse: if it was or if it wasn't. There's no denying that Hitchcock, whatever you think about him personally, was a master of his craft and even this, one that he didn't care for as greatly as something like 'Rear Window (1954)' or 'Vertigo (1958)', is shot to perfection. It really is an astutely directed picture, one in which each frame is set up to make the most of every situation, and every moment truly is as taut and 'edge-of-your-seat' as it could possibly have been. The overall narrative is remarkably unconventional - since it essentially puts a 'villain' in the role of protagonist - and manages to switch our sympathies superbly, sometimes within seconds, so that every character is as empathetic as the last and there is no clear 'hero', as well as no moral compass other than that of our own. Plus, that murder sequence truly is one of the most intense and nail-biting of its kind. 8/10",

While it doesn't compare to the complexity of the likes of Vertigo or North By Northwest, it's the brilliant simplicity that sets Dial 'M' For Murder apart from most other Hitchcock films. Taking place mostly in a small apartment, Hitchcock builds the suspense through the claustrophobic environment and that way that he deals us enough information to follow the plot, while keeping the real important cards close to his chest so that it's difficult to guess what's coming next. The film never has you sweating on the edge of your seat as you desperately try to guess what's coming next as some Hitchcock films have done; but Hitchcock still manages to achieve tension through his relaxed plotting, and that shows what an adept technician the man really was. The plot has the usual Hitchcock murder formula, and it follows a man and a plot to murder his wife. He blackmails an old collage buddy into doing the deed for him. After that plan goes awry, our villain sees an opportunity to turn the situation to his advantage again...but there's no such thing as 'a perfect murder'.",

Truffaut contradicts him immediately and rightly so. 'Dial M for Murder' is a special film in Alfred Hitchcock's filmography, the adaptation of a theater play, a seemingly trivial film and which has many reasons to be strongly marked by the 67 years since it was filmed. And yet, even for the contemporary viewer, this film offers many reasons for interest and satisfaction. The main reason is that Hitchcock does not hesitate to look for and invent the most appropriate means to tell the story and create suspense, turning the interesting but quite conventional detective plot into a significant theatrical and cinematic experiment.",

Rear Window might be the more well known of the two, but I don't think I'm prepared to say that it's the better of the two. Dial M for Murder is a thrilling story about an ex tennis player who plans to murder his cheating wife for the vast fortune she would leave behind.

Both the original text and this first adaptation present a plot of surprising twists, with a reduced cast and an almost unique setting, whose main merits are the convincing performances and the well-structured dialogues.

Based on a play, the film mostly takes part in a living room with Grace Kelly as a clueless wife of the gold digging Ray Milland, a former tennis star now just a man of leisure living off of his wife's money. Cummings falls for Kelly and her husband decides to murder his wife in order to collect her fortune. He meets an old college classmate and blackmails him to do away with Kelly. The best laid plans go awry and Hitchcock steers the viewer in several directions, as expected. The cast is terrific and the less said of the story the better.

168,22 November 2020,chetanhasallmoney,7, I am gonna talk the hell out of this film.,"Firstly, this is a great thriller and a great watch. A lesser known Hitchcock film and underappreciated for its plot. A young wealthy woman marries a tennis player and I suppose they have a happy marriage for some time. But after when our protagonist finds out that his wife is having an affair with a mystery novelist, he fears his wife would leave him and leave him out of her will and decides to murder her.Now, this is one of the only problems with the film. For me, this is not a good enough motive and I know he depends upon her but a murder is a little too far. He makes an almost perfect plan in theory and wishes to find someone to do it for him as he thinks police will instantly suspect him. Now he has this college mate which was always a trouble maker and decides to follow. This is an another problem as it is very peculiar and I know the protagonist is very smart but it is odd he follows someone when he could have been caught. He realises the trouble maker is scamming lodgers by changing his name again and again and doing other illegal things too. So he calls him because he is selling a car and pretends to be another person. Our protagonist tells him everything he knows and proposes a solution. He pays him some money and asks him to murder his wife which he agrees to. It is a clever thing done by our protagonist. The plan from the start goes wrong and the troublemaker is murdered by the wife in self defence. The police arrests the protagonist's wife as it seems she intentionally has done it. The husband is happy. But one detective senses something fishy and checks his doubts out and it is found the husband is guilty of ordering the troublemaker to murder his wife. The ending is terrific. But at end, it's not as interesting as other Hitchcock films",

Ray Milland plays Tony, an ex-tennis player who learns that his wealthy wife Margot is having an affair with a crime author named Mark. He hatches a plan that involves blackmailing an old college acquaintance turned criminal into murdering Margot. He goes over the plan with great detail but these things never go as planned. Margot survives a strangulation and kills her attacker in self defense. From there the chief inspector investigates, which places Tony is position to conjure up ideas that place his wife on murder charges. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock with a keen eye for plot detail despite a structure that is quite stagy. This is not quite the masterpiece murder suspense that Strangers on a Train is. Milland plays off the cunning yet desperate demeanor of Tony. Grace Kelly as Margot is torn between her husband and an affair that is not dealt with as the consequence it should. Robert Cumming plays Mark who is concerned for her future. Anthony Dawson plays the trapped and desperate criminal blackmailed into his own death. John Williams plays the clever chief inspector.

I saw it...I saw the brilliance, the eccentricities, the suspense and the camera angles and the way he made his actors portray their characters. His best work (in my opinion) seems to be Stage Plays adapted for the big screen. I've never seen anyone perfectly capture a Stage Play and make it so perfect on film. Dial M For Murder is no exception. This absolutely breathtaking murder mystery reeks of suspense and dark characters and a nearly perfectly paced mystery that never misses a beat for even a moment. You can absolutely tell it was originally meant for stage given the entire film nearly takes on one set but you never once feel confined or like its the same drab backdrop.

193,7 May 2020,zeekwunlau,8," A near ""perfect murder""","A great suspense film, which explained the murderer and the method of committing crimes from the beginning. The technique is great, but there will be many small accidents in the play. In addition to being assisted by the hostess, the hostess did not want to stay at home to watch the show and wanted to go out to watch the movie according to her usual habits (which is also the killer's expected plan). Wanting to keep the key and other things that did not meet the plan, the murderer also responded with tact. This also shows that the plan can't keep up with the changes, but the killer responded quickly and smartly. In addition, the biggest accident was the lethal scissors on the table. I do n't think it was by the phone suddenly. In the previous small accident, the husband used his means to keep his wife at home to cut the newspaper in order to complete the plan. The scissors appeared. The second point, when the husband explained the plan to the accomplice, the wife always forgot to close the window, so she was a person who easily forgot things. In this way, it is normal for the wife to leave the scissors on the desk next to the phone. It is not an accident where the scissors are, it is a matter of course, the writer arranges well. And I think this is also the result of the husband 's self-reliance. In order to keep his wife at home so that the accomplice killed her, she let her cut the newspaper at home, and the scissors used led to the accomplice being counter-attacked, so that the husband had to change the plan and show his feet . I have to say that the male host's resilience is indeed strong. One of the most ingenious parts of the show is the key, which is also extremely important evidence. After the accomplice killed his wife as planned, he put the key under the stairs mat, but the accomplice put it back before opening the door and preparing to kill. This is really a second. Normally, everyone opens the door and comes in. Anyway, if you kill someone, you can get out of the room. You do n't need a key. Therefore, there is no difference between replacing the key at the scheduled time and opening the door. It is estimated that the accomplice thought so. This was also normal and logical, and it is no wonder that even a husband who is so smart did not find the key problem. There is also the problem that the male owner did not find the key. Part of the reason is that since he found a key in the pocket of the corpse of the murderer, he took it for granted that it was the key used to open his own door (the wife's key). The detective thought that he usually carried a key to his body. But the husband didn't think about this. If the accomplice waited for the person to kill and then put the key back, there should be two keys. On the one hand, it is the husband 's guilty conscience or that the accomplice will be implemented according to the plan. After all, the accomplice also practiced a wave of plans in advance at home. It may also be a fan of the authorities, and behold the spectator. Compared with the husband of the planner, the detective is a ""bystander"", and it is easier to find the key problem. But the problem of keys is indeed very clever, and it is not easy to find out. Finally, there was a wave of screenwriters. Most of the scenes of the movie (including the final reveal) were completed at home, but they can show a ""nearly perfect crime"" story. There are also so-called bugs in the movie, but there are also many details. When we are looking for shortcomings, do n't forget how good it is. The first time I wrote such a long film review in Douban, I thought about it silently before. I hope I can communicate a lot and discover new things.",

He hires petty crook Anthony Dawson to do the deed, but it all goes wrong and she ends up alive, well and leaving him with an unforeseen headache. Enter, in my view, the star of this film - John Williams (""Chief Inspector Hubbard"") a resolutely persistent terrier of a police officer who is not at all convinced by the explanations he is getting and now we play the mother of all cat-and-mouse games.

Until a year ago, Tony was still on the circuit and often away from home. As Margot felt deservedly neglected, she turned to another gentleman, Mark (Robert Cummings) for love and affection. Quite by accident, Tony found this out. At once, he changed his schedule and stayed in London most days. Also, he started paying more attention to Margot and she is grateful. But, to what purpose? In his heart of hearts, Tony is SEETHING with rage and is plotting revenge in a big way. First, he is confusing Margot about who she loves and, also, has underhandedly taken a love letter from Mark and returned it. She is very alarmed that someone knows of her affair but she doesn't guess its Tony. More importantly, Tony has found a two-bit criminal to blackmail into bumping Margot off; this man has been cornered and will follow Tony's directions. Its quite an elaborate plot to get to Margot at just the right moment. But, as mystery writer Mark attests, ""perfect"" murders only happen in books. Sure enough, the plan goes off the rails. Now, Tony must cover his tracks and make sure HE doesn't get the blame! Is Tony smart enough to defeat the local detectives and, worse, turn the tables on Margot for her money? This fine Hitchcock film has great performances, especially by Milland as a suave, smiling killer. Sets are nice, costumes are lovely and production values are high. The main problem with the film is that it started as a play and the change in settings is very minimal, with most of the action taking place at Tony and Margot's house in London. Naturally, Hitchcock mixes up the camera work and tries valiantly to keep the viewers' attention. But, at least for this viewer, the mostly ""talk"" and lack of action becomes a bit boring. Nevertheless, just to see Milland work his evil ways as a ""gentleman murderer"" is worth the watch.",

Simply that I adore this film, see it again and again, always with the same delight, never getting tired of it. Curiously, though, it does not seem to me like a typical Hitchcock film... There is not a ""good guy"" fighting some ""bad guys"". The hero is a cold blooded schemer, who wants to murder his wife, but she is not so innocent herself, since she has a secret affair with another man, while her lover comes into their house seemingly as a friend, but is determined to make her leave her husband. There are no action filled scenes, the story is confined within the couple's house, and all is done with the utmost politeness and keeping of appearances. There is no ""murderer"", because the one that commits the actual killing does so in self defense.And yet, we are watching with undiminished interest, to see what will happen next. All the fascination emanates from the ""plan"", the setting, the idea, the master mind that orchestrates the crime scene,like a director does his movie, only his ""actors"" play it differently from what he had arranged. He swiftly opts for an alternative plan, and concludes his ""scenario"" with success, until a police inspector with unorthodox methods finds the loose end, the small detail that leads to the truth... At least 80% of the film's value is due to the performance of Ray Milland, he is pure perfection in his portrayal of the ex champion, the sportsman who organizes his last game, and almost wins the bet... I am very much surprised that he did not get a second academy award for this one, it really shows how unfair the whole system is. It is impossible to point out any favorable scenes, as he is brilliant from the first to the very last moment he is on screen. I especially love, though, the little scene when he hides Margot's handbag behind his back in order to steal her key , while she clings to him, so as to prevent him , both laughing while they struggle... Grace Kelly was very very beautiful in this film, more girlish and sexy than in any of her other roles, not at all like her usual sophisticated and coolly aristocratic self. With Ray Milland they made such a charming couple, that one is almost disappointed that things did not work well for them in the film. If only Tony had a way of knowing that Margot had decided to abandon her ex lover and stay with her husband, the story would have a totally different end! In such a case we would have a romantic film instead of a thriller, but I would surely love such a happy end! Something else that should be said is that Tony would not get the death penalty for what he did, because he did not actually kill anyone, he just PLANNED a murder that did not take place in the end, so he would probably be out after one year or so... I trust that he would be able to make a new life for himself quite easily after that! A film that has no need of any recommendation, its value is well established over the years, but I give mine just the same, as well as 10 points out of ten.",

It had everything, drama, tension and some action. All these combined with some great performances of Ray Milland and Grace Kely. This was the first movie I ever watched starring Ray Milland, and I can tell you that after watching this movie I declared myself a Ray Milland fan. He is so natural and such a believable actor. The script is very well written. It's so intriguing and catching, that you won't even notice the whole movie is happening in one room.

Imagine that Milland was acting as happy-go-lucky Professor McNultyin 1950's television show at the very same time that he was playing this cold, calculating villain.

Kelly's short career peaked in 1954, with ""Rear Window"", ""The Bridges at Toko-Ri,"" ""The Country Girl,"" and this fine entry.

This recounts the story of yet another instance of 'the perfect murder', that classic theme where an evil plotter constructs a plan of near flawlessness in theory which, of course, doesn't get carried out as imagined; as often reality forces an unknown, an unlikely event which in turns creates the intrigue for the film.",
213,8 May 2020,krational66,8, art,"The film is too succinct to be critical. Hitchcock takes no more than two minutes, and margo's smooches with Tony and mark quickly clear up the characters. Then, through the dialogue of the characters to elaborate, account for the two men's fornication, and buried a lot of foreshadowing, also put forward a lot of questions. By the time Tony closes the door and turns around, the building of the film's dramatic premise is almost complete. Given the title, it is not difficult for the audience to know what the story will be, but they can only get a vague guess, because the director can only give the audience so much information. Suspense ensued. The audience wants to watch.
From the house behind the policeman, the audience learns where the story takes place; From margo's newspaper, the audience learned about mark's occupation (which was important because he was an American writer, making his reasoning logically possible). This is the information provided to the audience visually. In terms of hearing, that is, a large number of dialogues, the topic of ""lost letter"" is raised, which makes the audience think together with the two of them. Who stole the letter? Whether or not Tony stole it, the director's goal is achieved -- and the audience is drawn into the drama.
All drama is conflict, and without conflict there is no drama. The conflict is revealed in the film's title, which is murder. There is no doubt that murder is bound to produce conflict, because if someone murdered, someone would be murdered, and no one wants to be murdered. As we know, themes are illustrated by characters and actions. Without characters, there is no action, and without requirements, there is no character. Demand, we learn gradually from the hero's elegant and easy dialogue, is the death of his wife. The theme of the story is obvious.
After the hero Tony and lees plan to kill, the film appeared the first plot point, that is, lees picked up the money on the sofa into his pocket, Tony's face is grim. This is where the plot ends and the murder begins.
At the end of the second act, margo is sentenced to death by the court. The audience will ask, will margaux die? If before this plot point her fate fell to the bottom, then after this plot point, it is inevitable that she will rise from the bottom, that is the turning point.
Find out the plot point, the paragraph of this film also came out. That is, the four points of the story: the beginning, the plot point at the end of act I, the plot point at the end of act ii, and the end. The episodes are, in turn, margo's affair with mark, Tony's plot to kill his wife, margo's wrongful imprisonment, and the real culprit's capture. Of course, this is only a general paragraph, you can continue to paragraph on this basis. For example, the third paragraph can be subdivided into three parts: the killer failed to be killed, Tony handled the scene, the police investigation and questioning, and margo was sentenced to death. The fourth paragraph can also be divided into mark's reasoning, the attorney general's inquiry, the three men's confrontation, margo's return home, and Tony's self-capture.
As a master of suspense, the plot of the film is by no means intended to disappoint the audience. And suspense effect rendering, turning this skill is not small, the story if there is no turning, all in the audience expected, and how to suspense? The film at the beginning of the use of a turning point, three people did not go to see the film according to the original plan, the scriptwriter a turn, Tony chose to stay at home. The conversation between Tony and leith is full of twists and turns, but the director tries to keep his nose out of the game until he finally reveals the murder plan, and the audience forgets that they were talking about the sale of cars. After that, margo's key, Tony's watch, the killer was killed, margo was caught, etc., turning and turning, the audience can hardly guess the next segment of the plot, suspense is fully revealed.
Zhang chi's skill, just take out the plan of donnie and lees that paragraph to see can have a glimpse of the leopard. The two talked at first in an easy, casual way, and then, with recollections, talked of the money stolen from the till. But the conversation turned, turned to the two people care about each other, talk about family, then turn, talk about killing his wife, and turned into a calm narrative, and then turned into a leisurely threat... Ups, downs, tension, relaxation, let a person marvel.
Hitchhiker's suspense can also be understood in the tone of the attorney general later. When the attorney general did not approve of mark's reasoning, I thought he was really stupid, but later I found out that he was playing dumb.
Fu should approach to say a clever use and a regret. Coup the scissors in margo's clip art, which is behind the killing weapon. It was a pity that Tony's careful handling of the fingerprints was not mentioned at all.
As for the choice of techniques, it really is to maximize the promotion of the story. Each choice of the protagonist is logical and reasonable, making the film watertight.
The story of the murder became a living art.",

The plot hinges on the whereabouts of the key and is instrumental in exposing the guilty party. So why didn't Ray Milland's character simply make a duplicate key? He went to such painstaking detail devising the perfect murder, you would think a duplicate key would be a no-brainer. It kind of subverts an otherwise clever premise.

The plot is about a man who wants to kill someone by, when she uses the phone next, strangling her. However, it backfires as she kills the henchman with a pair of scissors and a Plan B has to be devised about killing her while the police on the case. The story isn't the best, the only part of the story that intrigued me to watch this was to see what it had to do with a phone. The only scene that I excited me at all was when the main character realized that his plan backfired. Other than that, this is actually a very dreary film. But it's not all bad; the acting is great. I recommend this to anyone who likes murder, Alfred Hitchcock or just to see why it got to be so famous. If you're not one of these things, I suggest that you shouldn't be watching this movie at all.",

217,5 May 2012,gelman@attglobal.net,9, One of Hitchcock's Best,"There are two kinds of murder stories. In those written by Agatha Christie and Conan Doyle, the mystery is the identity of the murderer. Hitchcock specialized in the other type where the identity of the killer (or, in this case, the man who tried to arrange the murder) is known from the beginning and the mystery is how he or she will be discovered. Dial M for Murder with Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings is a classic example of Hitchcock's approach, though, of course, the viewer knows for a certainty that Tony Wendice (Milland) will be found out even after his rich, philandering wife, Margot Mary Wendice (Kelly) escapes the hired killer by plunging a pair of scissors into his back. The viewer is likely also to surmise that the third major character, Mark Halladay (Cummings), an American mystery writer and Margot's lover, will play a significant role in establishing her husband's guilt.",
218,22 September 1999,bat-5,7, It will keep you guessing.,"Dial M For Murder is a fine thriller that has all the usual Hitchcock touches.  The blonde, the wrong man theme, and always a standout scene that will stick with you for days.  The one from this film is the scene where Grace Kelly is about to be strangled.  The events leading up to this scene bring about a wonderful sense of dread and suspence.  You are glued to the screen to see if the murder will actually take place.  Hitchcock shot this in 3-D and it would've been interesting to see this sequence in 3-D.  Even more fun than the planning of the crime is the events that follow, the police inspection and how everything seems to fit perfectly in place, implicating Kelly and not Ray Milland.

222,4 November 2013,JPfanatic93,8, Hitchcock's strong crime thriller is best watched in all three dimensions,"If you think the contemporary 3D craze is a new phenomenon, think again. Though the current output of 3D movies far surpasses those of bygone eras, there have been two previous waves in cinema featuring the addition of a third dimension to draw audiences away from their television sets – first from the sets themselves, the second time from the choices offered by VCR technology: these days it's a combination of high quality television production, the relatively large size of the home cinema screen and the ease in digital technology for users to watch whatever they fancy that threatens audience attendance – the previous one during the Eighties, the very first one in the Fifties. Then, like today, some high profile directors, fascinated by the narrative and visual possibilities offered by the three-dimensional aspect, tinkered with the technology to see what it could accomplish and add to the overall viewing experience. During the short lived fad of the Fifties, the most notable director to explore the new dimension was Alfred Hitchcock, who used it only once, for his 1954 crime thriller Dial M for Murder. Though its 3D release was almost as brief as the interest in 3D technology itself in that decade, it cannot be denied the 3D version of this classic film still makes for a fascinating watch, both with regards to the use of the third dimension and the story itself. Thanks to the EYE Filmmuseum in Amsterdam, I got the opportunity to experience this film as Hitchcock shot it, in a beautifully restored print that utilizes the modern 3D techniques, which also benefits the vividly rich Fifties' colour palette that would have been absent in the original 3D print with its notorious red & green glasses.",

She was a great actress and they obviously worked well together! All the other major actors give the performance of their careers as well. Brilliantly done and very satisfying entertainment. Interesting that it appears to be the last major film for both Robert Cummings & Ray Milland, who went on to many TV shows, occasional B movies, and guest appearances. Even Dimitri Tiomkin delivered a very inspired score. While he was great at major themes and grand action music, he seems to ramble pointlessly in minor action scenes (""The High & the Mighty"" is a case in point. Some of the background music for the cabin action scenes seems pointless and unnecessary.) But...not in this case! He delivers a very inspired score that fits the film perfectly!

A crackerjack whodunit(actually since we the audience already know 'who', it's more like a 'how'dtheyfindout'), Hitchcock is well served by a marvelous performance from his lead, Ray Milland. This is the rare picture that actually tells the story exclusively from the point of view of the 'villain'. One reviewer wrote that the Bob Cummings and Grace Kelly characters were too shallow and underdeveloped. But that was exactly the point. The less depth the 'good guys' have, the more sympathetic Milland looks. It's not so much that we want him to get away with it, as it is that we get to know the inner workings of his mind. It is fascinating just to watch his eyes while he thinks on the spot how to change to plan 'b' while the original plan goes awry. You can almost see the wheels spinning in his brain. As with any mystery film, it's not just that we want the culprit caught, but it's how it gets resolved that's important. And for once in a  Hitchcock movie, it's the officer who figures it out(Shadow of a Doubt is probably his only other movie where the police weren't represented as evil, or inept, or nonentities altogether). John Williams, as the inspector, proves to be the perfect foil for Milland, and seeing the two of them in action is the key to the film. Cummings and Kelly obviously have the thankless roles, purposely underwritten, in my opinion, to heighten the tension. It's tough and unfair to judge those types of roles. They do the best they can with what they have.",
252,22 March 2004,ufo0001,8, *** out of 4,"Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Anthony Dawson carry this movie to almost greatness. Too bad Cummings and that annoying cop brought it down from greatness, but still again a very enjoyable hitchcock movie about a disgruntled husband who wants to kill his wife and take her money. His wife is cheating on him and he knows this and he knows she doens't love him anymore, so he figures, hey why not profit from this. He hooks up with an old college buddy and together they plan to off his hot wife. but of course, as in all movies, things don't go according to plan and he spends the rest of the movie lying his ass off and trying to evade a very very very nosy cop. Ray Milland should have been the leading man Hitchcock should have used in all his movies because he and his college buddy singlehandedly carried the movie as I found myself laughing at thier conversationg when they first met each other, pure classic. He was so calm and cool, likehe ha all the angles figured out, Stewart would have defintiely panicked like a biatch in this movie. Grace kelly was beautiful as always but her lover was very annoying because he was messingup a marriage and really gave poor Ray no choice but to off his wife. When he does get caught, he calmly accepts his faith like a gentleman and all this had been a game and even congratulates the cop in catching him.

She is given quite a bit to do, more than she would be in one of her usual parts. She deserved an Oscar for this one instead of the dreary The Country Girl. But back to this film. The camerawork is Oscar-worthy, and the direction as a whole is sublime. Well deserving of its 'classic' moniker.",

This film is not about the classic blackmailing of others to get them to do you're dirty work; rather, it's a tale of a man who will go to whatever depths necessary to seek retribution. Every single scene, angle and line in this movie contributes to the ultimate plan, and it's every piece that makes Hitchcock's movies such a puzzle.

Ray Milland gives the best performance of the film for me. Grace Kelly is fine, but bland and stiff. She isn't required to do a whole lot but change her expression from time to time and barely does that. To me, she is always aware that she is on screen and instinctively models for the camera. Of course she is beautiful, but she is so staid it is difficult to believe she ever had an affair passionate enough to cause all of this drama. And what the heck was in that darned letter at the center of the film? Still, you have to stay with it and watch all the way through to learn the great mystery of the latch keys. I have to admit, I hadn't figured it out. Some parts are a little unbelievable, such as seeing Grace's character coming back at the end, allegedly still facing execution the next day, and yet she is carrying her little purse, the center of so much controversy, as is a death row inmate would still have possession of her things, and she is shown standing alone on the sidewalk in front of her building, rather than in handcuffs, etc...since the audience does not yet know that the police have figured the whole thing out, it is a little beyond belief.",

It must be seen in 3D, otherwise cinematography, which is precisely calculated to emphasize the depth with objects such as lamps, would look terrible, for example. Most actions take place in one room so that the audience could feel as if they were watching a play. The theme, tugs-of-war between the husband and the others, e.g. the hit-man, the wife, her lover, and the inspector, is a bit unrealistic but suitable for the setting.",

I enjoyed it quite a bit, particularly the ending, but I do have one gripe with it. The film is shot like a play so there is a distinct lack of visual style, which is disappointing. I have heard that this movie is also sometimes shown in 3-D, maybe that somehow hindered the look of the film, or maybe it's the fact that I saw it in 2-D that made it seem like there was something missing. I don't know for sure, but that's my theory.

Right from the start Tony Wendice is aware of his wife's affair with another man. As his planned out perfect murder of his wife goes wrong your left on the edge of your seat waiting for what happens next. I wasn't completely against Tony's actions, as his wife was committing adultery behind his back. But, his actions are extreme and of course Hitchcock knows this and sets it up so that Tony will benefit by gaining all of his wife's money (which is a lot) upon her death. I really liked how Hitchock makes MArk, the man who Margot Wendice is cheating with, a writer of murder novels and at one point practically describes the whole incident, as it happened for real, to Tony, but actually has no idea that Tony is behind it all. This is a wonderfully constructed triller and just an amazing piece by Hitchcock.",

Something that I specifically loved was how after every unexplained action, the reason behind it hits you like a bullet due to the sharp dialogue that follows.
While the dialogue throughout the movie is very engaging, the climax alone is on the next level of gripping.
Also he makes his cameo in an unexpected way at an unsuspecting point.You just end up loving him",

315,24 February 2018,maxwsykes,8, An exciting thriller.,"""Dial M for Murder"" is a 1954 crime thriller directed by the legendary Alfred Hitchcock. It was adapted from the play of the same name by Frederick Knott, who also wrote the screenplay for the movie. It stars Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, and Robert Cummings. ""Dial M for Murder"" is about Tony Wendice, played by Ray Milland, a professional tennis player who wants his wife, Margot, played by Grace Kelly, dead. Margot cheats on her husband with Mark Halliday, played by Robert Cummings, an American writer who visits frequently while Tony is away on his tennis tour. Margot says that she destroyed all the letters that were sent to her by Mark, except for one, which was stolen, used as blackmail against her, and was never returned. Once Mark gets home, it is revealed that he intercepted the letter, and that he is the blackmailer, after he insists that Margot and Mark go to the theater. He reveals this by explaining it to his old acquaintance, Charles Swann, played by Anthony Dawson, who he studied with while in college. He then blackmails Swann into killing his wife, so that he may inherit her fortune. He sets up an elaborate plan to do so, but when the plan fails, resulting in Margot accidentally killing Swann, he has to think of a second plan to frame her for murder. It's a thriller divided into two engaging parts, combined with a great story and excellent use of cinematography. ",

NO ONE is going to execute Grace Kelly.","Even though we're convinced that a beauty like Grace Kelly won't actually ever hang for a murder she didn't commit, this is a fascinating flick, anyhow. Almost all of it takes place in only one setting - Margot's & Tony's small but classy apartment. Evil Is Interesting: we're enthralled by Tony's (Ray Milland's) evolving plot to murder his adulterous wife. Tony is even seen as somewhat justified, since Margot is adultering with a younger, handsomer man, Mark, as played somewhat limply by Bob Cummings. Margot's affair may be acceptable continental behavior, but it's grounds for a man to seek violent forms of ""satifaction"" in solidly-Anglo-Saxon Britain. Tony is a professional murder-mystery-writer, so we the audience root for a fool-proof scheme out of this guy, but just in the backs of our minds. The players are set into motion! The proxy murderer enters the house with Margot there alone! Tony is across town enjoying his well-thought-out air-tight alibi! Mark isn't in a position to save her! Then, Tony's plot fails! Margo physically turns tables on the man set to kill her, smalltime crook Swan. The tension in the murder-room, with Margot struggling while being strangled, then killing her attacker is all thanks to a well-placed common household gadget! Tony's plot fails, interestingly enough, but his wife may be put to death my His Majesty's Government thanks to a plot twist. WONDERFUL, Tony thinks. It could all end there, with perhaps Margot getting a commutation to life imprisonment or something, so we don't feel so bad for her. But, Hitchcock and the author both work skillfully to fool us. The Fat Lady will sing later. Inspector Hubbard, of Scotland Yard, played by the comfortably-English and familiar John Williams, has these attacks of conscience and must ""get to the bottom of things"". Altho his unfaithful wife is now safely on death row, Tony finds a Brit version of Columbo keeps showing up to bother him with little details. Egged on by Margot's old boyfriend Mark, Insp Hubbard, who first helped send Margot up the river, delves even deeper into the case. Using relentless logic, Hubbard drives events forward to their logical conclusion, as we see Tony falling to pieces mentally, a bit at a time. The script is brilliant in several aspects, mostly for introducing murder-plan elements that first confuse the audience. As these puzzlements are solved, a new perplexity comes into play, and we don't understand Hubbard's crime-solving method until the very end. There's no mystery about who did what, but there is a great deal of mystery about how the bad guy is going to get caught! So, this filmplay is done quite smartly.",

334,12 May 2013,stephparsons,7, Classy Hitchcock Murder Mystery,"Dial M for Murder is a classy 1950s Hitchcock 'murder mystery', suspense movie adapted from the stage play by Frederick Knott.   Although the film follows a well-trodden story line in which you know whodunit and you know who's  going to get his come-uppance in the end, you still want to see how it will all unfold.  The main characters - Tony (Ray Milland), his glamorous but subservient wife Margot (Grace Kelly), her lover Mark (Robert Cummings), and Swann (Anthony Dawson), the man hired by Tony to kill his wife  - do an impressive job playing their parts and the acting is skilled, subtle and believable (mostly).  The unassuming detective, Hubbard (who's not quite so believable and whose acting is a little dodgy), figures out more than he's letting on,  and lover-boy  Mark just so happens to be a crime writer so that's a handy combo when it comes to dealing with murder, intrigue,  and solving the 'perfect crime'.  The whole film takes place in Margot and Tony's apartment  (apart from a bizarre and slightly jarring court 'pastiche' where Margot's head appears in front of a swirly, colourful background that looked as if it was hastily crayoned on bristol board by an underemployed  boom-holder), followed by a disturbing flash of a red cloaked, improbably archaic judge.  But that's all by the by, as Kelly executes her role  perfectly, playing the obedient, compliant, and elegant, (but none too bright) wife and, in this day and age, it's quite amusing (or perhaps shocking?) to witness her deferral to hubby on just about everything. She 'does as she's told' even when circumstances scream out for her to take some initiative (well I screamed out anyway;  I mean, really...).  Her passivity was so well portrayed it made you want to shake her and yell 'get a backbone!' but that was the idea and it just leaves you so utterly thankful not to have been a wife in the '50s.  The sharp and elegant apparel sported by the main characters provides a satisfying feast for the eyes and invokes nostalgia for the days when people actually 'dressed up' (even if they were staying in for the evening).  Schlepping about in tatty jeans and t-shirts wasn't an option - that's what makes films of this era so visually rich and decadent (not to mention the non-stop smoking and unabated supping of cocktails or hard liquor, morning, noon or night).  The jaunty orchestral music is vintage cinematic  entertainment as are the dramatic crescendos of stringed instruments . We all know how Dial M for Murder will end but it's a clever and enjoyable ride and so absorbing I didn't even complain about it being  two hours long.",

Tony came up a perfect plan of killing his wife that will create an alibi for himself. When things didn't happen as expected, Tony has trouble to prove his ""innocent"" to the inspector(John Williams) who later arrived the scene.The movie mainly shot in one room, which makes it harder for audiences to focus for a long period. Instead of changing in location, the fast pacing of the story constantly hooked audiences' attention.
The acting part was sophisticated which means every expression on their face tells their inner emotion. For example, when Tony's presses his lips together to force a stiff smile, it gives you an idea of untrustworthy.

Under the guidance of one of the world's greatest directors and opposite one of the forties and fifties most reliable male leads, Kelly brings to life a tightly woven script that wastes not even one moment, every second building the tension to the final scene, like few others could.

You don't know what is happening in the first part of the movie but you begin to piece it together after the husband, Tony, starts to explain his plan. As he is explaining it you think to yourself there is no way he has figured this whole thing out all by himself but he surprises you. As i was watching this movie i was thinking to myself well what if this happens and then Tony says exactly what he would do if something were to go wrong and it blew my mind. The way Alfred Hitchcock takes you through a maze of emotions from confusion on why Tony wants to kill his wife to disappointment when you think the wife was the one who would actually do the time for a crime she didn't commit. I think the ending of the movie was a very artistic and bold choice. It ended with Tony walking in the front door with a key he shouldn't have used if he was innocent. It leaves you guessing what happens to him. It is obvious that he will get caught and be in trouble but even though it leaves you knowing what will happen your mind still goes in a thousand different directions. Will he talk his way out of it? Will he do the time for hiring someone to kill his wife? I think its amazing how just not showing the rest of the story can leave you thinking and wondering but also loving the way it ended.

Ray Millard does a brilliant job as a calm and calculated schemer who you cant help but like a little just for being so smug and sure of his plan. Grace Kelly puts in her usual high standard of performance and the rest of the cast are flawless too.

It is nice to see that the movie can keep its watchers engaged without having to change the set, aside from moving around in the Wendice's house. The casting is amazing, as the actors all do their parts flawlessly. The dialogue is probably my favorite part, because some of it is funny and some of it foreshadows, and it makes for a great plot. It's almost ironic that Mark partially uncovers what had happened, as he is a crime/detective writer. And even though Tony plans out everything, nobody can commit the perfect murder. 9/10",
363,5 August 2000,jasil,9, Good suspense doesn't require sex or gore,"This movie manages to create tension and suspense through the use of a good script, good acting, good directing, etc.  It also has a quiet style that increases the tension and is a pleasure to watch.  I would highly recommend this film for movie buffs who are tired of today's tendency to graphic sex and violence and four-letter words.",
364,12 May 2006,sharmaabhishekkumar,9, Another superb Hitchcock movie,"Hitchcock delivered another masterpiece, one could only wonder how one can create such quality movies without all that technology and special effects that we use today.It clearly scores above all what we are seeing today.",
365,29 January 1999,lsc,10, Great in 3D.,"You probably think I'm joking, but if you get a chance to see it in 3D, the original release format, go for it. It's not at all campy, like most 3D movies, which I guess tend to be in the SciFi or Horror genres.",
366,29 December 2021,camille-85394,6, Dial M for Murder Review (spoiler alert),"This was a really nice movie, although some part where very slow such as when Tony and Charles discus on how they will murder Marogot. I like murder mysterys but this one wasn't really good beacause we know who is the murderer. There is still some suspense in the movie, we don't know if Tony will get caught or not. I was a bit disappointed because the trailer look really good, I was looking forward to some action but there wasn't much. This wasn't the best of Alfred Hitchcock's movie so I will rate it a 6/10 star's. I recommend.",
367,11 January 2022,ines-29784,7, Interesting,"This movie was really good, there was some suspense which made it interesting, some scary part and some love part. I really liked the story. We can also see that the relationship between Mark and Margot is really strong wich make them win. Sometimes it would get boring like the big part when Tony and Charles are talking, I don't think that it needed to be that long. Most of the time they were in the appartement of margot and Tony so it was always the same setting which make it less fun than if it was on different settings.",
368,6 December 2006,kwoodard,9," Artfully done, a pleasure to watch",This film showcases great acting (esp. John Williams) and inspired direction while also delivering entertainment one viewing after another.,
369,15 January 2015,secondmine,10," Amazing, Amazing, Amazing ... Just Freaking Amazing",I just love this movie. Love it so damn much. My favorite movie of all time. Not only is the plot brilliant but the direction of Alfred Hitchcock is awesome. The way Tony Wendice comes up with a back up plan in split second was so ingenious but when the Inspector suspects it and proves Mrs Wendice innocent is just out of this world and blew my mind.,
370,9 January 2018,jdmoviechatter,8, It's A Good Film,"Although this film lacks the more cinematic qualities of some of Hitchcock's best work, it is a wonderfully twisty turny tale of murder and betrayal that kept me thrilled pretty much the whole time, even though the movie is mostly just people talking. It has solid performances and a gripping story. I would recommend this one especially if you like Hitchcock. You'll probably like it.",
371,3 May 2017,Fabioaveiro,8, Dial M for Murder,"Although Hitchcock's 1948 film Rope was shot entirely on set, a New York apartment, his 1954 movie Dial M for Murder, although it contains a scene in a gentleman's club and a vague montage within a courtroom, seems far more stage-bound that the earlier work. Every time I watch this film, in fact, I feel a sense of claustrophobia, in part, because in the small Wendice flat at 61A Charrington Gardens, the characters are for much of the film literally in each other's faces, Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) intimately close to his cheating wife, Margot (Grace Kelly), Margot beginning the film with a kiss with her former lover, Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings), and, in later scenes, the murderer (Anthony Dawson) sprawling nearly on top of Margot, the Chief Inspector (John Williams) hovering over Tony's every move.",
