0,28 November 2013,SnoopyStyle,9, The quintessential Vietnam war movie,"It's September 1967, and Chris (Charlie Sheen) has just arrived in Vietnam. He is sheltered and his father and grandfather fought in the military. As the new guy, nobody cares to be his friend. Lt. Wolfe (Mark Moses) is a weak ineffective leader. His men are divided in two. Some are followers of the cruel Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger). Others are followers of the humane Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe). In the end, Barnes and Elias are in a struggle for Chris' soul.",/
1,14 October 2015,ivo-cobra8,10, A Realistic Vietnam film Oliver's Stone's masterpiece,"Platoon is a 1986 American war film written and directed by Oliver Stone one of the most strongest realistic anti war films of all time. It is one of the best Vietnam war films I have ever seen that won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1986 and best Director for Oliver Stone, as well as Best Sound Mixing and Best Film Editing. Stone's Vietnam film portrayed a real life human been on his point of view of the story telling that went on in his real life that he experienced after his tour of duty in Vietnam ended in 1968, Oliver Stone wrote a screenplay called Break: a semi-autobiographical account detailing his experiences and the life he was in Vietnam. The characters were portrayed more then a few soldiers they were portrayed more as a human been than been soldiers obeying an order.Platoon shows the Vietnam War was a big mistake, but being a fictional documentary on Vietnam is far from its purpose. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. ",r
2,3 September 2003,Theo Robertson,9, One Of The Best Movies Of The 1980s,"The 1980s in general and the mid 1980s in particular aren't highly regarded where pop culture is concerned , this is most especially true in cinema where films seemed to be written around their soundtrack in much the same way as Hollywood movies nowadays seem to be written around their special effects . PLATOON is one of the very few films from that period that has an emotional impact , an impact that it still retains while watching it in 2003. ",e
3,4 January 2011,gigan-92,10," ""When I﻿ die, bury me upside-down, so the world can kiss my ass""","A+ Undoubtedly one of the best war films ever made, if not one of the THE best films of all time. Where to begin with such a film? A lot of this goes to Oliver Stone, who actually served in the God-forsaken jungles of Vietnam. The film really brings to light the atrocities and pointlessness of the Vietnam War full force, all cleverly represented by the soldiers who fought these not so courageous and valor-filled battles.",v
4,27 October 2016,tomgillespie2002,9, Still packs a punch 30 years on,"Ever since Steven Spielberg wowed the cinematic world and changed the aesthetic of the war movie forever with the exceptional opening 25 minutes of 1998's Saving Private Ryan - the film went downhill from there - audiences have come to expect the same grainy camera-work and ultra-realism of Spielberg's breathtaking vision whenever a battle is depicted. Anything else would be 'unrealistic', and many movies dated horribly almost overnight as a result. While Oliver Stone's Platoon, which was once considered difficult to watch due to its unflinching depiction of the insanity of war, may not seem quite as brutal as it used to, it possesses one thing that no war other movie can boast - the guiding hand of a veteran.",i
5,9 January 2010,planktonrules,10, Thoroughly unpleasant viewing...,"This is a very, very hard film for me to review. I was too young to be in Vietnam (thank God) and I have no idea what the real Vietnam War was like. Was it like John Wayne's THE GREEN BERETS? I am sure it was not! But, was it like PLATOON? I just don't know. Did the soldiers in the war do drugs, kill civilians and run amok? Yes, but whether or not it was the norm (like it was shown in this film), I just can't say. Some Vietnam vets I've spoken with say this film is accurate, others say it over-emphasizes isolated incidents because it has an agenda. I just don't know, especially since director Oliver Stone does have problems, at least in some films, with fictionalizing events (such as in JFK and Alexander). Regardless, it is a very powerful film.",e
6,15 May 2002,Agent10,8, Excellent look at Vietnam,"This certainly rates as one of the best Vietnam films of all time. What I especially enjoyed was the realistic atmosphere of the film, entrenching the viewer into a world which seems surreal yet believable. Oliver Stone's real-life experience in Vietnam brought a gifted outlook to this film, one drawn by experience, not common Hollywood conventions. While this proved be a lesser film to the equally amazing Full Metal Jacket, it was not by much. The performances by Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen and John C. McGinley were exceptional, capturing the plight of the tortured soldiers.",w
7,2 February 2018,asifahsankhan,8, Platoon focuses on the moral decay of the soldiers in the most unpopular war in modern American history,"Many great war films of the Vietnam conflict are centered around these themes of blurred morality and the uselessness of war, and Oliver Stone's Platoon is among the most well known. Stone, who wrote and directed the film and also served as an infantryman in Vietnam, first rose to fame for his war films that dramatized the infamous Cold War conflict. The main premise of his magnum opus are the inner conflicts within US forces deployed to southeast Asia, rather than the actual physical conflicts between them and the Communist-allied Vietnamese forces. More broadly, Platoon analyzes the ""duality of man"" concept that has been studied in numerous other works, from fellow Vietnam War films like Full Metal Jacket (1987) and Apocalypse Now (1979), all the way back to the latter's source material and inspiration in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. ",/
8,8 May 2004,red_core,9, within Vietnam and beyond,"Platoon is generally regarded as one of the strongest anti-war films of all time. While this is certainly true, what's often overlooked -- at least after only one run through the film -- is that it's chiefly a tale of God vs. Satan, and the war is there to set a perilous backdrop. No doubt, Platoon shows the Vietnam War was a big mistake, but being a fictional documentary on Vietnam is far from its purpose.",r
9,10 November 2013,ASuiGeneris,8," An illuminating expose on the long-lasting, personality-changing effects of the military and war...","I don't usually like war movies, at all. Platoon was an unexpected exception. Oliver Stone's first of three Vietnam War films, for me it really came down to an educational expose of the psychological trauma unique to war. With an all-star ensemble cast, the performances were exceptional. From what I have read, this can be attributed to training from a retired Marines Captain as well as director Oliver Stone's personal history as a Vietnam soldier. I believe Platoon to be an accurate representation of war on a micro scale, but not a macro one- any and all of these events could have and probably did happen at some time during the war, but it is unlikely that this much could happen between such a small number of men in such a short amount of time. The protagonist is played by none other than a young Charlie Sheen at his prime. Taylor's words of wisdom throughout the film are a testament to the long lasting effects of war. Veterans have a stereotype personality: more often than not, someone more logical than emotional; a lover of order, rules, and regimen; individuals willing to sacrifice for the greater good; a cool, collected, logical decision maker and leader even under high-pressure circumstances. As with all stereotypes, it is rooted in truth. Studies have shown that individuals attracted to the military tend to, overall, be a little less agreeable, extroverted, and friendly than those who do not seek it out. One study in particular finds them to be ""more aggressive"", ""interested in competition rather than cooperation"", and ""less concerned about the feelings of others"". These particular personality traits, whereas obviously not so great for romantic relationships or for forming lasting friendships, are often an asset in career success. For example, these individuals are more likely to make the difficult decisions sometimes necessary for success. ",w
10,23 January 2006,Lt_Coffey_182,8, Shows the harsh realities of war very effectively,The Vietnam War has been one of the controversial wars in history and was an unpleasant experience for everyone involved. Oliver Stone harnessed these experiences to make Platoon; a film where he could illustrate to everyone what Vietnam was like from his perspective.,8
11,7 October 2017,ma-cortes,8, Visceral and violent war film by Oliver Stone based on his own soldier experiences in Vietnam,"A very strong and tough Vietnam war film made by Oliver Stone who has directed his film in the form of Patrol Drama , a formula much beloved by filmmakers of Hollywood , War and western movies , and revived successfully by this great director . As a shy soldier , Charlie Sheen in the lead , arrives as a rookie in a veteran platoon led by two very different sergeants , the good boy : Willem Defoe , and the bad guy : Tom Berenger. They are accompanied by a motley group of soldiers as John G. Mcginley , Kevin Dillon , Tony Todd , Francesco Quinn , all of them are resplendent , among others.",1
12,1 June 2015,Red-Barracuda,6, Pivotal at the time but hasn't aged as well as some other Vietnam films,"Platoon is the film that not only put director Oliver Stone well and truly on the Hollywood map, its huge critical and commercial success also would set the Vietnam War film cycle into hyper-drive. It centres on a platoon on a tour of duty in Vietnam through the eyes of a young recruit who quit college to volunteer for active service. It is in essence a combat film where the view is at ground level. In this sense it mixes traditional gun battles with the smaller more personal details that show the discomfort of life in the jungle. Its approach was very realistic for its time and in some ways it did reinvent what a war film could be.",9
13,17 November 2016,bkoganbing,8, What a war,The only military conflict that was in the American experience similar to Vietnam was the Phillipine Insurrection. I doubt that any of the characters whom Oliver Stone created for Platoon would even have known we were in a five year war in the Phillipines battling elements wanting independence after the Spanish-American War made the territory our's.,0
14,9 March 2018,TheMovieDiorama,9, Platoon is so much more than just your average war film.,"This is actually rather intelligent, both in its plot and technical execution. It's the Vietnam War, we follow a platoon of US soldiers as they attempt to wipe out the enemy. The question that this film raises is: who really is the enemy? You have the conflict of the war itself (America against Vietnam) but within the platoon is a conflict for authority. Split between what is right and what is wrong, the moral implications of this war have taken effect on several soldiers as they question their choices. This was a smart element to include within the plot, it was easier to establish character development and build some tension. The majority of the characters were sufficiently developed and their personalities had charisma. This was mostly down to the great cast. Willem Dafoe was easily the best performance, Tom Berenger was also decent and the heated chemistry between them was well conveyed. Charlie Sheen however, didn't work for me. His acting ability consisted of monotonous dialogue delivery and shouting, perhaps he was overpowered by the rest of the great cast? I don't know, just felt meh. Didn't help that his biggest battle was with nature...we're talking ants, leeches and other insects. Obviously, animals love abit of Sheen. Oliver Stone's direction was solid, very realistic and gritty. The makeup effects were practical, the wounds and blown up limbs looked pretty damn realistic. A standout scene was the raiding of the Vietnamese village. This was the turning point where actually the American side were perceived as the antagonists, clearly communicating with our inner moral compasses. Effective, very effective. This is easily one of the best war films I've seen and winning Best Picture was fully justified.",7
15,10 June 2010,alifanova,10, Hell is the impossibility of reason,Why I think Platoon is probably the best war movie Hollywood ever made? Because it's very humane. I mean it. The director sees all his characters as victims of war rather than heroes or villains. Have a closer look at 'em.,1
16,13 March 2003,bzb2001,10, Still my favorite film,"Every once in a while I will watch this film again and see if maybe I have grown tired of it.  Surely after ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Titanic,"" ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" or ""Schindler's List"" I have seen a better film.  Well, after every viewing there is something about Oliver Stone's masterpiece that keeps me saying that I have never seen anything better.",0
17,12 October 2016,Leofwine_draca,7," Hard-hitting, and then some","Oliver Stone's hard-hitting, compulsively watchable Vietnam epic is based on his own experiences fighting in the US army. It's rightly regarded as something of a classic film of the 1980s, and watching it you get the right idea about war: it's a terrible, soul-destroying, and utterly nihilistic experience in which men are turned into cattle and moralities fly out of the window. It's also a hugely influential film; pretty much any Vietnam film made since must use this film as a template. You can't imagine Mel Gibson's WE WERE SOLDIERS without this, for instance.",/
18,7 September 2022,richardchatten,8, Green Hell,"As much an exercise in nostalgia for the sixties than a war movie, Oliver Stone despite his celebrated use of Barber's 'Adagio' can't resist slipping in a couple of popular hits from his youth. The platoon devotes far more time to fighting each other than engaging the enemy, showing a lack of empathy towards the Vietnamese that is truly shocking.",?

22,27 March 2016,sharky_55,5, Something from Ecclesiastes,"So it seems to me that the ideals of Platoon are to be anti-war...to not ascribe any blame towards the overtly political powers that drove this war but to centre it on the human aspect of the soldier itself, and how it loses its humanity. Sheen's bleary, self-serious voice- over narration says so as much - that the enemy was within themselves, the violence from their own hearts. And Stone collaborates this idea with his visuals; there is scarcely a clear shot of a Vietnamese soldier, guns blazing. The danger is all around them, but it is murky and indistinct, and the paranoia settles into the platoon quite easily, and begins to affect them. There is no logic or reason to the madness, to the hysteria of the violence, to the casual beckoning of death itself after a few weeks in the jungle. ",_
23,22 January 2005,brown301,10, Best Vietnam War movie you can see,"Platoon is a must see for any fan of war movies. The film that put Stone on the map, Platoon is considered by Vietnam Vets as the most realistic (my father having been one of them). But in keeping the maxim of giving credit where credit is due, much of the success of Platoon belongs to military adviser Captain Dale Dye, who has been linked to pretty much every great war movie in the last twenty years. Much accolades to Tom Berenger as well, whose performance as Sgt. Barnes is the tour de force of his career (the scene in the village towards the end of the movie is brutal, befitting the character). With a great script, great performances, and awesome cinematography, Platoon is a surefire classic.",=
24,26 August 2016,Mr-Fusion,9," ""... we did not fight the enemy; we fought ourselves""","""Platoon"" is hardly an obscure movie, and I guess the reason it's taken me so many years to finally see this is - I dunno, you see enough war movies over the years (not to mention having seen ""Full Metal Jacket""), how affecting could this actually be? That's a stupid reason, and the joke's on me; ""Platoon"" is devastating. This is probably as anti-war as they come, and that it's partly somewhat autobiographical just gives it more punch.",t
25,28 April 2017,pere-25366,9, Up there with Apocalypse Now and FMJ as one of the best films to depict the horrors of the Vietnam war...,"... and for good reason! Platoon is a unique war film in that it almost plays out as more of a morality tale and the inner conflict that eats away at the insides of man rather than focusing primarily on the conflict with the enemies. In Stone's film, we are given in-depth examinations into both the atrocities of the war and those committed by the Staff Sergeant supposedly on the 'good side' of it all. Played to perfection by Tom Berenger. his terrifying portrayal of a heartless Sgt. becomes all the more frightening when contrasted with the compassionate, caring nature of Sgt. Elias, portrayed by William Dafoe. The film is unapologetically outspoken in its depiction of the horrors soldiers faced in the war and with razor-edged editing that nabbed Academy Award honors, it really does immerse you, almost uncomfortably so, in the hell these men endure. One of the best.",t
26,15 September 2010,hhalukkilic,10, Hurtful,"I watched Platoon when I was 17 at 1987. I was on the edge of questioning everything and ready to uprise with a small move. Of course I was fascinated after watching the movie and I remember I was that close to cry. I can definitely say Platoon is one of the best war movies of the history. It has many incredible scenes and it reserves a great story of brotherhood inside also vandalism and senseless of war. Charlie Sheen , William Dafoe and the great Tom Berenger can easily be considered as one the best combination of actors to tell a story of faith and betrayal in a movie. Oliver Stone did a great job as writer and director. I remember that I was really touched with the letters that Taylor ( Charlie Sheen ) writes to his grandma. Also with the amazing music of the film you feel many different things. I believe that on the last scene the picture of William Dafoe with his hands open on his knees with hundreds Viet Congs coming after him is a masterpiece work and unforgettable.I watched this movie at Osmanbey Gazi movie theater at Osmanbey-Istanbul and ı believe 70's and 80's are the best time in Istanbul for watching a movie with big saloons and with great atmosphere. With 90's big movie theaters started to turn to couple of small saloons and with shopping malls movie theaters started to locate at malls. I really miss a lot of 80's and the taste I get from the legend movie theaters like Osmanbey Site-Sisli Kent-Osmanbey Gazi- Pangaltı Inci-Harbiye Konak and Harbiye As.",_
27,21 September 2004,FilmOtaku,7, A personal and gut-wrenching look at the Vietnam War,"Oliver Stone's 'Platoon', which he wrote and directed, is partly based on his own experiences in Vietnam. Our protagonist, Chris (Charlie Sheen) is an idealized kid from a privileged family who feels it is his patriotic duty to enlist, and therefore is one of the lone volunteers in his platoon, headed by the badass Staff Sgt. Bob Barnes. (Tom Berenger, looking even more badass with a deep gash in his face that runs from forehead to chin) Somewhat acting as Chris' mentor is Sgt. Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe), and the two provide (in the most rudimentary sense) good and evil influences as Chris experiences the every day horrors in the jungles of Vietnam; from the irritating  bugs, inclement weather, to the terrifying  combat with the Vietcong, to the gut-wrenching  the ruin of a Vietnam village, mostly innocents.",u
28,21 July 2001,Vogue189,10, One of Oliver Stone's best films,"Platoon left me absolutely numb after watching it. Oliver Stone,(Who in fact did serve in Vietnam) did a fantastic job telling this story of the horrors and the insanity of the Vietnam war. What's to be admired about this film, is that Stone doesn't sweet-talk the story, with the good old American boys fighting for their country and facing brutality, instead he brings up a strong morality and humanity issue. It's wasn't all black and white, it wasn't one person was wrong, one was right, there was all shades of gray in between. He uses the characters of Sergeant Barnes and Sergeant Elias (both played brilliantly) as symbols of good and evil clashing into one another. Charlie Sheen (Chris, the narrator of the story) is in a sense torn between both, they are both a part of him as he tries to deal with things falling apart all around him. Vietnam was a senseless war, and Platoon tries to understand why we went through it and how we ever got through it.",r
29,29 April 2016,goreilly40,9, Brutal but honest.....,"Of all the war movies I've seen, this is probably one of the most honest and non-romantic depictions of the 20th centuries longest war I've seen. Its a hard movie to watch but its meant to be as it shows the war for the hell it really was, its authenticity cannot be praised enough thanks to Oliver Stone's personal experiences that he went through when serving in the war. The actors put themselves through a tough boot-camp in order for an accurate portrayal and it showed, they didn't have to act exhausted and weary as they genuinely were. Charlie Sheen's depiction as the naive bright eyed college kid who joined up for romantic reasons, but quickly learns the harsh realities of the war is one of the more memorable. likewise Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe as two battle hardened but morally very different veterans are also very memorable. The fighting and battle scenes again are unforgettable and accurate and the show just what the American solders were up against and how slippery and how hard the NVA and the VC could be to pin down. One aspect of the movie which I found refreshing was it didn't attempt to picture the Americans as angels, it showed that they could be no better or sometimes worse than the enemy they were fighting. Now in comparison with Full Metal Jacket, this movie is no better or worse, as it depicts a different aspect of the war than this movie, this movie depicts the type of fighting the soldiers had to do before the Tet Offensive, jungle warfare, where-as Full Metal Jacket depicted urban warfare in the Tet Offensive. So if you want an non-sugar coated, accurate and authentic portrayal of the Vietnam war, then this movie is for you.",v

32,1 July 2011,classicsoncall,9," ""There's the way it ought to be. And there's the way it is"".","Oliver Stone's politics are no secret, but at the same time it would be difficult to characterize any film about the Viet Nam conflict as anything but anti-war. ""Platoon"" takes that idea and personalizes it in the battle of wills between two diametrically opposed warriors - Tom Berenger's sadistically ruthless Sergeant Barnes, and Willem Dafoe's humanistic Sergeant Elias. Charlie Sheen's character, Private Chris Taylor, serves as the viewer's moral arbiter between the two, attempting to make some sense of the untenable situation he finds himself in once he sets foot in the jungles of Viet Nam. We share his thoughts as he writes home to his grandmother, realizing that his noble ideals will be severely tested, while coming to an early conclusion that 'Hell is the impossibility of reason'.",

This was one of the most captivating experiences I've ever had while watching a film and I still watch this at least once a year. The cast is perfect. Charlie Sheen has never been better, Tom Berenger is hypnotizing and very scary as Barnes. Willem DaFoe plays Elias as a mentor and guide to life for Charlie Sheen's character. There are similarities between Elias and Jesus Christ, especially when Elias is killed. He dies with his arms outstretched, as if to say he sacrificed himself for his men. Stone's film never misses a beat and proves that he is a film genius.",
42,2 May 2014,videorama-759-859391,9," Vietnam, as frank as you can see it, without the gloves","Yes, it was the Vietnam movie, in a trilogy of three, ala 1987. What I read about it, and seen briefly through, clips, yet when I went into the cinema, I still yet was disappointed, but respectfully it is a great film. I just expected more realism, I guess. The opening is haunting, and leaves an imprint in the memory for those who would of seen it. Told through the eyes, of a school dropout Chris Taylor (Sheen, very good), who sighed up for the Nam, we follow his eye opening journey of hell, how with fresh eyes, how it perceived, the terror of Vietnam, no holds barred. Granted, there are some really tense moments in Platoon, concerning Charlie, the enemy, one indisputably tensely charged scene, with Sheen on watch, where he's in close proximity of them. Another scary moment had a gentle humble, Sergeant Elias, wonderfully played by Dafoe in still one of his best performances, going into a bunker underneath which is like cavern where he explores it, with a little bit of company. Of course, it's Berenger's show in the life of the story and his performance, as stout hearted and uncompromising Barnes, the head Sergeant, running the other platoon, where he butts heads a lot with adversary Dafoe, and in one shocking moment towards the end, Not only with this whole outfit fighting the enemy, both platoons are fighting each other. I couldn't stands Barnes's platoon, that partly consists, of a fawning type, John Mcginley who went on to become a very and sought after commodity as character actor, while Kevin's Dillon's borderline psychotic Bunny, will live on in my mind, probably, secretly, one of the film's best performances. As in Casualties Of War the death of innocents related to the enemy are again, sickeningly disregarding, as in court marshaling, brushed under the carpet stuff. Ironically the same actor who sided with Penn and his boys, in this, he's the other way intent, on seeing, this unlawful killing by Barnes goes to trial, if proved. The scene with Bunny in the tent, was sickening, though the violence was implicit here, where he was smashing the brains of a gook civilian's head in with the butt of his rival, splots of blood, staining Bunny's face. Platoon, with a crafted script by Stone and A grade performances by it's actors, is a film to see cinematocally, the photography is excellent and does work. May'be I really got carried with the realism aspect of the film, but it's still a pretty real and effective that will scar the memory years after seeing it. For a war film, trying to win an Oscar as best film, is war itself. This was one that did.",

45,29 October 1999,Goon-2,2, Can a film BE any more overhyped?,"Did Platoon actually win Best Picture? Please tell it didn't because if so, HOW BAD WAS EVERYTHING ELSE RELEASED THAT YEAR? This film is the epitome of a sub-par movie and I practically feel as though I'm being polite for saying so, considering the numerous flaws this one has. The acting is okay, but nothing more than that, the characters are dull and the ""heroes"" are beyond non-sympathetic, the script lacks depth, and the ending is terrible. Why people can pan a fine movie like ""Limbo"" for its ending and not this is beyond me. I've never seen such a terrible message given, but what can you expect from a movie where the heroes bond during a big drug circle? Even the film's one really good scene(where they're in Vietnam and freakishly shooting just about anybody) literally goes nowhere. I think it was merely supposed to reflect the 'goodness' of Captian Elias and the monstrosity of Tom Berenger(pathetically the most interesting character), or something, but who knows, considering nobody in the movie is even mentioning anything about it 10 minutes after it happened, though one would have thought it was supposed to be a great plot twist? That, along with a ""shocking"" scene where a helicophter flies away, leaving an important character behind(so ridiculously done that I couldn't help laughing aloud)and this is real ""Best Picture"" fair alright. What a taint to the Academy Awards.",

47,25 February 2015,Movie-ManDan,9, Not Just A Great War Movie.,"Platoon is loosely based on real life situations that writer/director, Oliver Stone went through when he was in the Vietnam War. This is also parallel to Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 masterpiece, Apocalypse Now. I'm going to start out by saying that I found Apocalypse Now to be a much better flick. Platoon is practically the same story with everything inferior, which is why I'm not giving a perfect score. When compared, Platoon is inferior. Even when not compared, this movie gives a great sense of deja-vu. ""Haven't I seen this before?"" Both movies are about a Sheen enlisting in the Vietnam War and transcend into madness and insanity while partaking in the horrors of war. Apocalypse Now has Martin Sheen on a mission to assassinate a demigod while Platoon has Charlie Sheen's mental state wearing thin after a massacre occurs. Apocalypse Now has build-ups and gets somewhere with the plot, and has an overall better look. Platoon is certainly not bad. Heck, it IS as good as everybody says. It won Best Picture and Director of 1986, but I think Aliens should have won one of those.",

The purpose of the war was to the fight against communism, a long going threat occurring during the decades of the Cold War. Director Oliver Stone who was a Vietnamese War veteran himself makes a brutal, but utterly effective portrayal in this war drama based on his experiences in the Vietnamese battlefields. Charlie Sheen plays Chris Taylor, a young man in his late teens who drops out of college and voluntary for active duty in Vietnam. With no combat experience compared to the other men in his platoon including the hot-tempered Staff Sergeant Robert Barnes (played by Tom Berenger), the more kind- heart Sergeant Elias (played by William Defoe), the aggressive and ruthless Lieutenant Wolfe (played by Mark Moses), and fellow African-American Big Harold (played by Forest Whitaker); Chris faces the dehumanizing effects of the war and the moral dilemmas of men in active combat as the platoon fight their through the grueling environment and atmosphere of the Vietnamese battle front.",
50,13 July 2018,harryplinkett14,1, Fake,"The film has as its core the supposed moral rift between two fundamental attitudes to war, represented by the two officers in the protagonist's platoon. But that conflict does not exist in real life, only on film. If the aim of the film was to say something about human nature, it failed. The characters are caricatures, nothing more. In real life, most soldiers simply don't care. They want to survive, they do what they have to do, and that's it. War is about survival, not philosophy. Soldiers don't spend their free time between battles thinking about good and evil. They think about how much they miss home. And when civilians get killed, no one has the time or strength to worry about it. You are too busy being on the edge of a nervous breakdown, or thanking God you didn't die. You just don't care.",

The soundtrack, while now iconic, adds to the overly dramatic feel, and while I like Charlie Sheen, his acting here is subpar at best. The story Platoon tells is meaningful in the differing ideologies of Sergeants Barnes and Elias, but the movie lacks the seriousness of war movies far greater.",
52,21 April 2014,khanbaliq2,9, The Vietnam War is recreated with striking realism in Platoon.,"Platoon is clearly one of director Oliver Stone's most inspired films. Stone volunteered for the army in 1967 as a college drop-out. He wrote the screenplay for Platoon in 1975 but it took over ten years until he was able to film it. What separates Platoon from other American films dealing with the Vietnam War is that it depicts wartime massacres. Films before that, like The Deer Hunter (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979), only focused on the shattered psyches produced by the war. Keep in mind though that Platoon is a mainstream movie, so it doesn't come anywhere near the brutality that the Americans sometimes demonstrated. The 1968 My Lai Massacre, in which as many as 504 unarmed civilians were killed, is just one of many examples. The Vietnam War is considered to be the greatest trauma of 20th century American history, but a few decades later the USA savagely attacked Yugoslavia and Iraq. Platoon made a lot of money at the box office, mainly because Stone has the ability to make a film entertaining no matter what it's about. The film's partial blindness to the war was another reason for its success. It's not made clear who the American soldiers are actually fighting and why they invaded Vietnam in the first place. Let's also not forget that Stone dedicated the film to the men who lost their lives. So, when Stone is accused by some people of being anti-American or a leftie I can just laugh at their foolishness. What's most interesting about Platoon for me is that Stone brought his own experience of being a soldier in Vietnam. When Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) said that you don't really sleep even when you do get time to sleep I was immediately reminded of what my father told me. My father served in the army. Even though he didn't see combat he told me that he still stayed awake. In Platoon Stone looks at the war from his educated middle-class point of view. He shows the behavior of under-privileged blacks and of ""white trash"" from middle America. Stone's direction is very good, so it's not a surprise that he won an Oscar. With cinematographer Robert Richardson he managed to capture some impressive images. He also brought intelligence to the film by depicting a war between two sergeants, Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Elias (Willem Dafoe). It's pretty much Jesus (Elias) fighting against the covetous shadow of the American dream (Barnes). The performances by most of the cast are very good. Berenger and Dafoe are terrific. They're clearly the standouts. Historian Carroll Quigley thought that what happened to Western civilization in the first half of the 20th century was a tragedy. It's clear why. There were two big wars, a depression, and the coming of fascism. In addition to that the Russians foiled the plans of the Germans and the British and captured Eastern Europe. Yet Quigley still had hope when he wrote his famous book in the 1960s. But, as the Vietnam War dragged on, he began to lose this hope. He began to think that Western civilization is nearly finished. I think that there's still hope for Western civilization, though the Vietnam War was yet another example of the crisis that this society is going through. Platoon isn't my favorite war movie. I like Come And See (1985) and Apocalypse Now (1979) more, but I easily recommend Platoon too.",

Nobody wants to know the new guys and they are seen not to matter. As time passes he becomes accepted in the group but at the same time it becomes clear that there are deep divisions within the platoon with those half behind Sgt Barnes, the brutal but effective platoon leader, and half behind the more sympathetic Sgt Elias; these tensions deepen when Elias reports Barnes for a war crime committed in a Vietnamese village; Taylor will have to choose his side if he is to survive the conflict between the two sergeants as well as numerous fights with the North Vietnamese Army.",

One recalls a statement made at the time by somebody in close concert with the logic of the Vietnam War: ""We had to destroy the village in order to save it."" But more inclusively, Oliver Stone's film addresses the question of what war does to us as it focuses on Pvt. Chris Taylor, played by Charlie Sheen, who gave up his student deferment, joined the army and volunteered to fight in Vietnam as his patriotic duty.

What Oliver Stone tries to teach us with this Vietnam epic is of the horrors of the Vietnam War and what a horrible event it really was in our history. The acting is complex, the music score tries to make us think of the horrors of all wars, the cinematography is terrific, and my gosh what a great movie this really was.

""Platoon"" is considered his greatest movie ever!! I thought it was extremely compelling!!! ""Platoon"" won the academy award for best picture in 1986, and, Oliver Stone won for best director for this film that year as well!! I would have to say that my favorite Oliver Stone film is ""Talk Radio""... With regard to all of Oliver Stone's movies, ""Platoon"" is the most critically acclaimed, hence, this is his trophy!! ""Platoon"" deals with the laborious tragedies of the Vietnam War, and how one horrifying conundrum had the ability to vitiate so many soldier's sense of naivety!! While the vast majority of Americans were reticent to criticize the United States involvement in Vietnam, they also did not have the clairvoyance to envision the idea of how we as a nation would get so involved with such a sustained and prolonged occupation in this archaic nation (Vietnam) either!! The precarious political agenda of our constituency on Capital Hill cultivated an intransigence with worldwide decorum, as well as with the wishes of the American people!! This movie is an incredibly astute depiction of how some young soldiers became victims of congressional blundering!! A war should be fought for national cause and not for political agreement!!! The movie ""Platoon"" articulates an uncanny ability to purvey a moral dissonance with the unfortunate plight of so many Americans during the Vietnam War!! Oliver Stone is once again very cunningly successful at depicting human atrocity to it's ultimately dire and absolutely abhorrent level of socially conscious pitfalls!! The acting in this movie is spectacular, the actors include, Tom Berrenger, Charles Sheen, Johnny Depp, and John McGinley!! AFI ranks ""Platoon"" as one of the top 100 movies ever made in the American cinema world, and, this website ranks it amongst the top 250!! YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!! IT IS FABULOUS!!!!",

I was very young when I first saw it and it had a very strong, moving influence on me that have stayed to this day. I saw it today again, it was a while since last time, but I'd never thought it would move me, shake me and still have such a strong influence on me still today as hardened and weathered as I am today. It really depicts the hell on a personal level as few war movies has ever done since. It is a movie that has an educational value for each and everyone today that has an interest in what war does to a human being and the scars it leaves on both sides, and shows the hell like it really is. In that way it is really understandable why it was so controversial and shook the establishment as it did when it released. Many of the famous actors we see today basically made their real debut in this movie and it is interesting in that way too. Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe are spectacular as the two main adversaries of the story, and each and every one of the cast portrays their characters in a great way. If you have any interest in modern history, war and how it affects people this is a must see for anyone, not least the younger generations that wants to know about the pain and hell real war really is.

Nevertheless, by Oliver Stone using a first person perspective, the audience knew the main character was not going to die, which in turn reduced the thiller nature of the film as we knew nothing serious was going to happen to SHEEN. Saving Private Ryan gave the impression of a real war with enemies and not know who was going to survive. Platoon is a fantastic drama, not about war in itself, rather a character study of the effects of war upon people who are meant to be close to you. The real enemy was within than external.

Filmed with a mixture of subjectivity, as we never leave the journey of the story's particular platoon, and objectivity, as Stone tracks with them from a distance through leaves and bushes, Platoon epitomizes the Vietnam experience. Stone may have based restless but controlled Charlie Sheen's Taylor character on himself, and the film may revolve around him- --and one or two long takes indeed do just so---yet his experience is deeply felt by all of the characters. As he becomes more and more hardened by his journey into the heart of war, Taylor finds himself brusquely wavering between those who gravitate fearfully toward Barnes, an indestructible and forbidding return to one's earliest primordial nightmares, played by Tom Berenger, whose acute perception communicates the intimidating feeling of Barnes' presence, and those who gravitate toward Elias, a sagacious and optimistic veteran, played with self-contained receptiveness by Willem Dafoe, whose compadres, similarly cool and detached, share his accepting aura.

Easily in my top 50 of all time I adored this movie. From the opening scene of this movie we can tell that the main character played by Charlie Sheen is not even trying to hide his regret or fear he is in constant fear for his life and this was a very bold choice and a very good one, it's clear that Stone took from his own experiences in Vietnam to make this film seem more real and it payed of. This is an extremely atmospheric movie, you can practically smell Vietnam through the screen, every time it rains you feel the soldiers cold and discomfort and has action sequences rivalling that of Saving Private Ryan. Charlie Sheen was excellent in this movie he does a really good job at portraying his character as a vulnerable and inexperienced soldier and it allowed the audience to relate to him more as a character and his one man war between his two sergeants is riveting to watch and gives us an impression as to how the war effected everybody in different ways, take Willem Dafoes character an upbeat sergeant trying to make the best out of this situation or Tom Berengers character a wounded, damaged soul having lost all hope of every regaining the humanity he lost. Both Dafoe and Berenger are amazing in this move and both worthy of Oscars and career highlights for the both of them. This film has some truly disturbing and brutal sequences committed by both sides of this war, it could have been easy for Stone to paint the Americans as the good guys in this conflict but he doesn't there's a lot of scenes where they are truly committing atrocities that will leave an impression on you.

Occasionally something actually happens/explodes, but then Stone goes into hyperactive camera mode.

86,18 April 2012,brando647,8, A Powerful Vision of Vietnam from Oliver Stone,"PLATOON is a movie that didn't really impress me much when I first watched it, but I found that it grew on me after a few more viewings. I've never been into war movies but there's always been something about the Vietnam War that grabbed my interest. It didn't play out like a normal war. It was deep in the jungle and the soldiers that experienced it encountered more than your average wartime strain. The jungle is a beast all it's own and to find yourself battling in it's nightmare terrain where the enemy can and will come from all sides at any moment is terrifying. I love a good Vietnam War film, where the focus is on the experiences of the soldiers as opposed to achieving victory. APOCALYPSE NOW is one of my all-time favorite films period, and FULL METAL JACKET is an intense view of a soldier's life from boot camp through the horrors of the war. So when I sat down to watch PLATOON, my questions was: how well did Oliver Stone's vision of the war stand up to Coppola and Kubrick? PLATOON follows the experiences of one soldier, Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), as he arrives in Vietnam. An idealistic college student, Chris believed it was everyone's duty, not just the poor, to do their part in the war. Once he arrives, he discovers that nobility doesn't even enter the picture. It's all about survival and the law of the jungle, and he's caught in the conflict between the gung-ho Sergeant Barnes and the liberal Sergeant Elias.",
87,26 May 2005,sol-,10, My brief review of the film,"At times horrifying and intensely realistic, this study of comradeship and fighting in war is a stunning, albeit imperfect, piece of cinema. The tropic setting is excellently portrayed, with natural sounds recorded brilliantly, but the explosions and noises of combats are equally captured well. The camera-work and editing and appropriately frantic, and Georges Delerue's haunting music sends a chill down the spine. The quality of the acting from the entire cast is superb and Charlie Sheen is fantastic in the lead - he is able to convey a sense of innocence for his character very well. Towards the end it all becomes a bit too monotonous, and the message feels like it is pushed a bit far, but the only really significant problem I found in it was that Dafoe and Berenger just seem too simply developed as symbols of good and evil. This is not however anything that detracts from the experience, but something that entered my after-thoughts.

91,30 September 2019,aciessi,7, When the Machine Breaks Down...,"In Vietnam, the only war these men were fighting were themselves. Platoon is a treasured war picture about the Vietnam war. It's Oliver Stone's explosive debut as a big league filmmaker. Powerful and courageous was he to capture the inhumanity of the war, and it's affects on the average American soldier. Some are overtaken by it. These themes are familiar in Vietnam war movies, and shall I say, done significantly better. The one man account of the confused and hopeless nature of the war is far more effective in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now. The war's barbarity was captured more accurately in Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. Platoon by comparison falls into the issues of the formulaic. But big credit goes to performances by Willem Dafoe and Tom Bringer as the tyrannical and sadistic Sergeant Barnes.",

One of the few Vietnam flicks that gives a fair account of what it's like to fight on the ground in a war run by strategy-free nitwits, though Mr. Stone probably didn't intend it that way.  The personal conflicts and dilemmas come across as real and plausible, without the usual Hollywood pacifist moralizing--until we get Charlie Sheen's sentimental (and dead wrong) voice-over at the very end.  (Historical note: some of the marquee posters for Platoon advertised a story from America's ""bloodiest and most unpopular"" war.  Neither description is true.)",

97,28 August 2014,dworldeater,9, Great Vietnam War film from Oliver Stone,"Coming off Oliver Stone's underrated, but not so successful feature Salvador. Platoon is a critical and commercial success. At this point Oliver Stone had made his mark in Hollywood as an excellent screenwriter with classics like Conan The Barbarian, Scarface and The Year Of The Dragon. This production was his breakout film as director. However, if you ask me Salvador(which Oliver wrote and directed right before Platoon) is a great film that never got the respect it deserves. Platoon is the first Vietnam War film to be made by a veteran and was based on Oliver Stone's experiences. Platoon is a very well structured and great looking film that captures the gritty essence of war but is beautiful to look at as well. Characters are rich and well developed and the story flows smoothly from scene to scene. Performances are top notch from an up and coming cast of great actors and future stars such as Charlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger, Keith David, Forest Whitaker, John C Reily, etc. The story is told through Charlie Sheen's(Chris) perspective and is a morality tale about innocence lost, different takes on the war from soldiers who support the war and those who do the best they can to stay alive and survive a war they found to be immoral and insane. Willem Dafoe is from the latter camp as Sgt. Elias. Tom Berenger delivers his best performance as hard as nails hawk Sgt. Barnes. Following in the footsteps of his father(Martin Sheen) the underrated Charlie Sheen does an excellent job as the lead in his own classic Vietnam War film. The battle scenes are gritty and Oliver did not try to sugar coat the material in any way. He shows the madness and brutality of the war and did not shy away from showing atrocities that became associated with the war. The film won a richly deserved Oscar for best film and director in 1986 as well as best sound and film editing. Platoon made its mark and hold up great decades later as well as making Oliver Stone a household name.",

Chris, at the beginning, faces a lot of difficulties concerning his survival in such a cruel and harsh environment. While he is beginning to acclimatize, he has to deal with important ethical issues that come along with his more active involvement in the battles with the Vietnamese. Two men, Sergeant Gordon Elias and Sergeant Robert Barnes, are the two voices in Chris' head, just like the little angel and the little devil flying over our shoulders, that shape him and his moral code throughout his stay in Vietnam and stigmatize him for the rest of his life. Oliver Stone in a masterful manner in this movie, demonstrates the alienation, caused by such a bloody war, to those who wage it, whether they are high rank officials or just a private. The movie is a cry for the poor youth of his country, that was wrongfully wasted in this war, but also for the civilians, who are the ones who suffer the most by the hands of the two sides fighting this war. A very strong cast of actors, who all give their best selves to succeed in passing through the message the director was trying to send with this exceptional movie, but the point of interest, as far as acting is concerned, is Tom Berenger's powerful performance.",

But, men are more complicated. Multiple forces in conflict. Poor vs wealthy. Black vs. White. Good vs. Bad. American vs VC. Human vs nature. And these are just some of the external conflicts.

By the 1970's, film rhetoric about war began to shift to another angle. By the time of the release of Platoon, films began painting an altogether different portrait of the war experience from the perspective of the private on the ground rather than from a general or colonel. ""Platoon"" never depicts high-ranking officers discussing tactical plans in an administrative room or racing around in jeeps, saluting the troops. This is war at the ground level where the battles are fought and people suffer and die, regardless of the cause and the winners. From the perspective of ""Platoon"", nobody ""wins"".",

It's about the true experiences Oliver Stone had in the Vietnam war. It shows war on different levels including men from the same side turning on each other. It has a lot of power because of this and it gives it an emotional aspect. This movie has a lot of heavy material and is sometimes hard to watch at times. The violent battles show the soldiers getting transformed into killing machines after many frightening experiences and close calls they have. The movie both looks and sounds amazing. I really like the film's score. When it's played, it really helps us get immersed in the scenes due to the notes and beats in it. Sure, some of their choices of actors are a bit questionable like putting Charlie Sheen in an emotional role but I didn't seem to mind it that much because they played the roles with such great emotion and power that it didn't seem to bother me.

114,21 July 2002,Angry_Arguer,10, Not pleasant (is war ever?),"Vietnam, to most other countries, probably has the same meaning as 'nostril' and 'book'--pointless.  But here in America, it is a very sensitive issue that even today is hard to bring up and still be far in opinion without sounding bias or snobbish. ""Platoon"" takes the uncomfortable situation of being in a foreign, hostile country with comrades who can be as psychotic as the enemy and weighing that on your conscience for two hours.  It isn't a film where you can sit back, relax, and watch the fireworks.  You must use your mind to consider the situations of the unit and ""think with them"" to a degree. The first half, set in 1967, takes us into the war only two years old and rapidly gaining unpopularity at home. By the end, 1968, we come face to face with battle in a fashion not jingoistic like John Wayne or gritty like Saving Private Ryan, but rather a punch in the gut that doesn't try and give you $100 million explosions and brand-name actors looking clean and cocky. In all fairness, they are ugly, tired, and their mixed emotions of the growing conflict they're embroiled in is eating away at them faster than the leeches. I praise Oliver Stone for not putting 'glory' in the public sense of it into the film and presenting just how hellish, up-close-and-personal, and unforgiving war can be.  I guess only by serving yourself can you truly understand what it's like.",

While it is a visually interesting film, the script and story don't really evolve and make 'progress' towards something more that just a continuous collection of raw, sometimes powerful scenarios that we observe.

121,20 January 2022,cmantafounis,6, Platoon,"Fundamentally worsened by the context of its specific sub-genre, one awfully oversaturated by unanimous masterpieces, all released at around the same time: The Deer Hunter (1978), Apocalypse Now (1979), and Full Metal Jacket (1987 - famously shafted at the Oscars for being released the year after this very film). As a result, if I wished to see a character drama on the prevailing effects of war in veterans' daily lives, I would consult the first film in that list. If I wanted a masterfully cinematic depiction of the war itself, I would watch the second. And if I were looking for a satirical portrayal of war's effect on an individual's psyche, I would seek out the third. All this to say that Platoon may be a worthy fourth-head on this hypothetical Mount Rushmore of Vietnam-war movies, but it still accomplishes little that the others didn't already do better. This covers all-too-familiar territory, with concepts such as masculinity, dehumanisation, class/race divisions, sexual depravity, layers of morality, the duality of man, et cetera, et cetera. What it does do differently is offer an on-the-ground perspective, as much of the runtime is dedicated to combat scenes; that being, incidentally, the aspect I find least interesting about war films. (Except when done to the highest degree, i.e. Saving Private Ryan.) Thus, despite the execution being mostly excellent - particularly struck by the visuals: gorgeously saturated colours which contrast well (green/red), plus some first-person shots or people talking directly to the camera also used effectively, and just generally well-framed and cut together - my engagement was relatively hindered. These characters are too one-note to maintain interest in their dynamics; this may be intentional to mirror the homogeny of a soldier's war experience, but the final result is unappealing from a narrative perspective. A general lack of subtlety altogether (again, many times purposely so, yet it was still bothersome): the first scene shows our protagonists walking off a plane, entering Vietnam for the first time. A body bag happens to be carried past them as one says, ""Is that what I think it is?"" A higher-up responds, ""Welcome to 'Nam,"" and then (as if we didn't get it yet) another squad walk past, evidently having recently come back from the field, warning them to be scared and that they are not ready. Much of the film is like this, blunt and unforgiving - effective when depicting battle (the scene in a local village borders on too brutal, threats of rape and child murder et al) but not so much on a thematic level (the VO narration is perfunctory at best, pandering and counterproductive at worst). It is an apparently theatrical production, exemplified by its most famous sequence: Dafoe being shot down in slow-motion, on his knees trying to crawl away, overbearing strings playing overtop. Last thing to mention is the performances, as Charlie Sheen is an unexpected choice for the lead role, especially when viewed through today's lens. He is adequate enough that I bought his character arc, though often maintains the same expression throughout, and rarely projects the supposed inner turmoil in a meaningful way. Some awkward line delivery from everyone, and at least one instance of horrifically obvious ADR. Berenger initially off-put me, but by the halfway point I was convinced he was perfect casting. I love Willem Dafoe in everything that he's in, and this is no exception. That's about it.",

124,18 March 1999,emm,8, A strikingly accurate view of wartime horror in Vietnam.,"Oliver Stone's PLATOON accurately lives up to the experience of fighting hard and dying in wartime. Nothing takes place elsewhere on the globe except for being inside the bloody, torturable action at Vietnam. If you're a veteran of the Army or Marines who still carries a peace sign, then you'll see why this picture (and as with many others) is gratefully dedicated. This appeared to be a first for the screen, perhaps a step above other war films. It paints a hair-gripping portrait at fighting during the Vietnam War with strong attention to graphic details based on extremely true and tense situations. You might complain that this looks nearly like another 80s war action movie with no real substance, but this put into effect is demanding along with tensions, pain, and suffering on the battleground, which is conceivably portrayed. Take very careful notice of the end conclusion, which is horrifyingly true! While I'm waiting to see SAVING PRIVATE RYAN for the first time, this movie was best for starts. PLATOON is a milestone for (yes) Oliver Stone. I can't always judge a Best Picture winner to the most supreme, but let's say it does rank among the few best innovative war pictures that stood a long and lengthy test of time.",

The point Stone wants to make is that war is brutal. And he keeps making that point over and over again for two hours. The film is nothing more than a series of battle scenes, with interludes for drugs and booze. The battles are less than compelling because they are against a faceless enemy. Almost every line of the dialog includes a popular four-letter word and its adjective form. Furthermore, everybody spews clichés.

Although Apocalypse Now had a number of moments of brilliance, but on the whole I think it suffers due to a disjointed script. Platoon on the other hand is intense right from the get-go. Like many of the other films dealing with the Vietnam war,in this one too,the dark, gloomy and unrelenting jungles of Vietnam serve as a separate character in itself. The soldiers find themselves trapped in the hell that we call war. Oliver Stone executes a detailed analysis of why soldiers tend to lose their sanity and their minds in the torturous conditions. There are a number of soldiers in the film who commit heinous acts and behave hideously, but considering the circumstances, it is understandable as in a hellish environment, it is not strange if people lose their humane qualities.",

We get some bloody gunshot wounds, TONS and TONS of bloody corpses , a brutal beating with a gun, (and what's said after that had happened is very disturbing). a VERY graphic bloody gunshot wound to the head with blood and brains splattering, and TONS and TONS of very graphic but non bloody gunshot wounds. The acting is Oscar worthy. Charlie Sheen is utterly fantastic and gives an Oscar worthy performance here , he is EXTREMELY likable and did a fantastic job. Tom Berenger is an awesome actor and did awesome here but his character was VERY unlikable. Williem Dafoe is great here as usual i liked him lots.

Charlie Sheen plays everyman in this film and he watches how war makes some men heroes and other animals. Bereger and Dafoe are good examples of how men change.

Platoon's main villains are in the platoon, who brutally kill fellow soldiers and murder innocent Vietnamese including women and children just for fun. Charlie Sheen plays his best role portraying Oliver Stone in the war, who is probably the only director to make a war movie out of his own experiences. Tom Berenger and Kevin Dillon are the most menacing characters I have ever seen, the only characters I personally wanted to kill on film. To be a Vietnamese watching this film must have been an awful, mind-numbling experience: watching your own descendants get brutally mis-treated as in this movie.

Wow! That exclamation was the first word out of my gaping mouth after sitting through Oliver Stone's Platoon. Stone's movie follows in the footsteps of other great Vietnam War films from the era such as The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, and The Killing Fields. Stone's visceral approach gave the infamous war its most realistic story yet. Of sorts, this film is an autobiography of Stone's experience in Vietnam. I loved how he gave no clear vision whether the soldiers in the platoon are good or bad. Yes, the main enemy is the Viet Cong. In the end, the soldiers had to face malaria-carrying mosquitoes, unknown swampy terrain that could hide the enemy, and each other. Some of the soldiers lose their sense of what's right and wrong and could be a danger to one another. Stone made sure his audience is well aware of that sense.
The film took years to receive the proper funding and studio release. The basics of the film came into play when Stone wrote a screenplay called Break which detailed his war experience. In the 1970's, some basic ideas from that script became The Platoon which would have secured producer Martin Bregman, director Sidney Lumet, and star Al Pacino. Those plans fell apart and his writing skills were used for the excellent 1978 feature Midnight Express. Despite the critical and financial success, Stone still had trouble getting his pet project made. He dabbled in the horror genre with limited success, but once his script moved into the hands of British producer John Daly, Stone finally got the movie made. It went on to be a huge success ultimately winning the big prize at the Academy Awards.
Like most war films, the battle sequences are expertly shot (although the darkness sometimes make it hard to figure out what is going on) and thrilling, but that is where any similarities end. Stone purposely made his movie a character drama about the horrors of war taking the soldiers into the long, dark descent into madness and despair. Within the platoon, there is no good guy or bad guy. It is whoever is standing the longest that wins. The movie asks long, hard questions about morality within a war setting. People head to war wanting to play the hero, but instead they are surrounded by death and heroism is nowhere to be found. Stone drills these points home as he does not hold back.
This film centers around Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), a young, naïve American college student looking to play the hero role as he goes to Vietnam to fill his patriotic duty. As soon as he arrives, he learns that he is a nobody because members of his platoon served longer and saw combat. He platoons with people like King (Keith David), Big Harold (Forest Whitaker), and Lerner (Johnny Depp). He has two platoon commanders; the ill-tempered Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) and the more human-friendly Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe). When the platoon comes to a village and commences in an illegal murder, trouble brews within the platoon itself. Is it time to the pick the right side or is there no truly right side?
The acting is phenomenal. Under the direction of Oliver Stone, Charlie Sheen delivers in a big way. His portrayal of the innocent becoming changed for the worse is heartbreaking. Willem Dafoe, as he always does, likewise delivers a strong, intense performance as one of the good sergeants that is fueled by alcoholism. Tom Berenger captivates you with his performance as he loses all traits that would make him a capable commander. The film features a variety of familiar faces such as Forest Whitaker and the very young Johnny Depp. Like I have seen people say, this film is a three-man show. The realism is astounding especially within the military outfit.
In addition to the expert direction and superb performances, the cinematography and the music are also important highlights. Robert Richardson gave us some iconic images that we would forever haunt us. Georges Delerue's use of ""Adagio for Strings"" is bound to make you emotional.
Overall, Platoon can be a movie that is hard to digest. It takes away any conventionality that we know from war movies and replaces it with hard realism. When Stone was doing anything he could to get his film made, he was told that the aforementioned movies about Vietnam War are reasons why he should not make this film. Well, he made one that is just as good. My only complaint is that the movie can be too dark to follow at times but then again, that is all part of the realism that Stone wanted to show us. If you do not think madness will envelop you, I implore you to give the movie a watch.",

180,11 March 2011,philosophyking87,1, Most Overrated Move Ever,"This is by far the worst, most overrated movie I've ever seen. There is no proper character/background introduction and the opening dialogue is very bland; as a result, the opening is quite stagnant and rather uninspiring. Throughout much of the film, tension is constantly built via brutal atrocities and blatant crimes against humanity: events such as the killing of innocent civilians with grenades, non-threatening people's heads bashed in for no reason, and a woman shot in the head for apparently yelling a bit too hysterically. The prime villain responsible for this happens to be in command of the platoon and few dare question his authority. Those who do are either killed for no reason (with regard to the 'plot') or are simply too helpless and timid to do anything about it, so that the second half of the film does nothing to properly resolve this tension. The result is a movie with no real justice. On top of this, the sound was cheap (as the firing of guns sounded like plastic toys), the action scenes were unimpressive (with actors running around aimlessly), the acting was petty, and the picture quality was mediocre. Overall, the movie comes off too preachy, contrived, and dry with really two-dimensional—good or bad—characters, and in essence, just isn't worth it.

Stone has an OPINION and a TAKE on things which he throws in our faces. He is SUBJECTIVE, as all art should be.All these people here on IMDb that say that Platoon and other Stone pictures don't do justice to Vietnam veterans miss the point.This movie is not only about Vietnam veterans, it is about people in an extreme situation.About feelings, emotions and human behavior.It is fairly historically accurate and it is enough.Dialogues are excellent, as all dialogs written by Stone.Of course you have to FEEL like Stone to really appreciate his movies.You have to connect.If you don't, that's OK, but don't criticize simply because you don't agree with how he perceived the events. Acting is brilliant,filming beautiful,screenplay excellent. You can sense the 100% passion that went into the making of this movie, and this is the most that you can ask from an artist.

Platoon stars Charlie Sheen and Willem DaFoe in the 80's. They are soldiers in the Vietnam War. They experience the full blown hell that war produced. Platoon was directed by Oliver Stone and most of his movies are very long and have extreme detail. Platoon is no exception having a deeper meaning than what is shown. Vietnam veterans suffered greatly during and after the war. Platoon shows the suffering during the war. I thought it was interesting how towards the end a soldier is talking the Sheen and he says if they survive the war they will go home heroes and life will be easy. In reality it was the exact opposite and I wonder if soldiers really thought that or if that was just for comic relief. Either way the story was basic, fight the war and survive, but it turned into something more. It turned into what is right and wrong in warfare and how or who to fight. Soldiers in Vietnam were exposed to drugs and Platoon shows how soldiers would relax by taking drugs and smoking cigarettes. The reactions to these drugs and the warfare itself drove soldiers insane and caused them to commit terrible acts that Platoon portrays. Platoon was historically accurate as well and that is very important. Situations the movie showed really happened. The scene where they raid the village and terrorize the farmers actually happened. It was a historically known massacre that really happened; I just can't remember the name. Soldiers didn't know who the real enemy was so they attacked everybody. Innocent people suffered because American soldiers could not control themselves and the pressures of the war got to them. They raped, murdered, and pillaged the village and that was just the beginning. They weren't only fighting the Vietnamese; they were also fighting each other. Barnes and Elias had their differences and they fought constantly but the betrayal of Barnes where he basically murdered Elias was just epic. That scene was just so bone chilling. Barnes chases him down and they stare each other down. It's a showdown and they look like they can read each other's minds. Barnes shoots and Elias falls down to the ground. Barnes tells Chris, Sheen, that he is already dead. Chris and Elias were good friends and shared similar opinions on the war. Barnes and Chris retreat to the helicopter but as they go up they see one of their own running towards the helicopter. It was Elias. He ate so many bullets and was bleeding everywhere. It was the ultimate betrayal. He was killed by his own squad and he raised his arms and looked up to the sky which became a classic pose from the movie. He falls over, dies and the helicopter flies away. Throughout the movie there is music from the Vietnam era but in every sad or serious scene the same tune of violins plays and makes the scene so much better. I always say the music can be the most important part of a movie. It sets tone and mood. It can make or break a scene and every time those violins played the audience knows the scene is important. Let me make one thing clear. I hate Charlie Sheen. I don't think he is funny; he is crazy, and a terrible actor. He should not be allowed to make anything else in the industry but that is just my opinion. Luckily this was before all of that garbage and he really did a good job. In parts of his acting I laughed and thought it was ridiculous but about an hour into the movie he stepped it up and did an amazing job. It made me respect the man more for his acting and what he had in his young career. It is a shame he let drugs ruin his life. My problems with the movie were that there were a lot of characters, possibly too many. Forrest Whitaker and Johnny Depp were in the movie but they disappeared. They were important for a scene and then I don't know what happened to them. Did they die? Did they leave the war? I don't know. Maybe somebody can let me know so please comment. For a war movie it wasn't the best I've seen but it wasn't really about the war between the Vietnamese but more about the war with themselves and the betrayal of soldiers. It was more emotional than physical and in a movie about Vietnam that should be portrayed so kudos to Platoon for that. Overall it was a fantastic movie that was more than a war movie but an emotional tale of soldiers in the Vietnam War. They suffered greatly and this movie probably most accurately portrays the devastation of the war. Action, acting, emotion, music, and overall performance were all good. Platoon easily gets the WillyT seal of approval but Charlie Sheen needs to just go away. I really just don't like the man or anything he is in, other than this movie. I could watch this movie again and again and can be viewed alone or with friends. Don't let young kids watch it obviously; listen to the rating on the movie because it will probably not end well but still a great film for mature audiences.",
192,31 January 2019,csab-39797,9, Best Vietnam war movie,I say it's the best movie about the Vietnam war because the entire film is about the war.

193,16 September 1999,Chuck-149,8, The first casualty of war IS innocence.,"It didn't take long for Oliver Stone to make a name for himself. Beginning with his Oscar-winning script for ""Midnight express"", he has continued making great scripts and movies all along the years.  However, not that many people knew him or followed his career even after he won that Oscar except for his biggest fans.  So ""Platoon"" could be considered to be his breakthrough movie and not only because it won Oscars for best picture and a best director one for him, but because it was really good. ",

2- the acting was so barely passable. Arguably the best actors were the Vietnamese people in the Village - by like, a LARGE MARGIN.
3- the overly dramatic Berenger character that consisted of just one layer: bad-guy. Backstory? Pfffff - who needs backstory when you have pyrotechnics!!!!!
4 - the plot - ummmm, I think it was ""March through the jungle, and then there were 10, Charlie does something to demonstrate that he has virtue in an immoral war, repeat (minus a few guys.)""
5- the TERRIBLE ending and sappy speech. Ugh. Just cringy.
6- B movie script, crappy delivery- ""angry"" dialog for example was delivered like it was being practiced by high school kids rehearsing for a play.....
7- Willem Dafoe's positively ridiculous death scene. Was it conceptualized by an angst-y middle school girl???

Charlie Sheen plays a private in the Vietnam War who volunteered himself for battle to try and find himself. He quickly comes to notice while he's still wet behind the ears that things are not what he expected and that maybe he has bitten off more than he can chew. Led by two opposing leaders and father figures, he quickly learns the skills he needs to survive and kill.",

201,9 January 2023,arthur_tafero,10, This is THE Vietnam Movie - Platoon,"Aside from being the Best Picture of the Year for 1986, this film is also the best Vietnam film ever made. It has more character development than Apocalypse Now, a great Vietnam film in its own right, and is consistently engrossing from beginning to end; unlike Full Metal Jacket which slows down a bit after losing the greatest sergeant performance on film ever seen in the first half of the movie. This was a film dominated by three great performances, and several great supporting roles. Oliver Stone knows what he is doing when he examines Vietnam. Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe steal the film from Charlie Sheen, who, quite frankly, is just not a good as actor as either of the other two, but he is fine in this role. Forest Whitiker and Johnny Depp have minor roles in the film as well. Sheen's character struggles between his mother and father figures in the film, played by Dafoe and Berenger, respectively. It is an interesting dynamic. From start to finish, we are involved in a harrowing and tragic experience for both the soldiers and the people who live in the country. Highly recommended.",
202,12 May 2002,Dennis_Cooper,1, Cartoonish Portrayal of the Vietnam War,"Platoon is to the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing. Oliver Stone's story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is so overdone it's laughable. While most or all of the occurrences in Platoon did occur over the 10+ year span of US military involvement in Vietnam, to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame (weeks) gives a horribly skewed picture of the war. In Platoon, the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two: US soldiers murdering civilians, US Soldiers raping civilians, a US Sergeant murdering another US Sergeant, a US Private murdering a US Staff Sergeant, US soldiers killed/wounded by friendly fire, 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon. For Stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam is a disgrace. Two Vietnam War films I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the TRUE story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie.",

In the time Oliver was serving,Amercia was still behind the war and the troops were not out of control zombies. I am ashamed of his village scene.I was not in Nam, so I have no story to tell.The film Platoon must be viewed in this context. It is part fiction and part non fiction. Do your research and don't always listen to Oliver and his lies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
205,17 April 2000,jtfsouth,9, Good vs Evil,I couldn't tell you how many times I have seen this movie. Every time I do see it I find something new that I have missed the last time. The story line is not hard to figure out but the decisions Sheen's character has to make that are. It's a basic story of Good (Defoe) vs Evil (Berenger). This was also a summation about Stone's own experiences during Vietnam. Though the same incidents in the movie  may not have happened to Stone personally (such as what happened in the village) but the sheer chaos everything that did happen over there was a great overview of what was seen in the movie.,
206,31 December 2007,johnnyboyz,9, Very strong war film that deals with not only the physical horrors of war but the psyche and masculinity challenges the soldiers face.,Don't let any thing anyone says about this film fool you for Platoon has broken my top 50 and has very quickly etched its way into my list I have at the back of my mind detailing my favourite films in the war genre. A conclusion I came to when watching Platoon and something that is echoed during new recruit Chris Taylor (Sheen) in one of his voiceovers is that the real enemy is indeed the one from within your own side; the conflict that is going on within a band of people all attempting to prove how macho each other can be over the others: disagreements over authority is a common re-occurrence. This made me make a connection to how American's at home took to the Vietnam War at the time ie; they didn't like what they were seeing and hearing thus; were also against what was happening. The voice of authority is being heard and causing problems not only in the film's platoon but also on the homeland as people complain.,
207,28 February 2013,zachvalencia,10, Deserves way more than an 8.2,"This movie was downright unbelievable. Very well done and kept you interested throughout the entire movie. It shows the horribleness that went on in Vietnam and how it was truly a life changing experience. The veterans over there went through very little sleep and had to go through fear almost every parts of the day. I personally did not go in the Vietnam war but from what I heard this is the most realistic movie of what happened in Vietnam. The ambush scene where Taylor is just waiting in fear with his hear pounding that the Vietnam soldiers would not see him. I also love the final battle scene it had lots of action and was very intriguing. When Elias was running from the soldiers was a very emotional scene. Charlie Sheen was magnificent along with Forrest Whittaker, Willam Defoe, Tom Berenger, and others. Taylor had to witness murder, rape, and injustice by his fellow soldiers or as he put it ""he couldn't tell what was right or wrong anymore. It was truly grew and I highly recommend it.",
208,28 May 2000,robsellke,10," Hard to watch, but important and truthful","""Platoon"" is one of the most realistic war movies ever made.  It deals with the fact that while Americans were fighting in Vietnam, horrible war crimes were commited.  In this movie, the main character is Chris Taylor, played by Charlie Sheen, a man who volunteered for Vietnam out of a sense of duty to his country.  His grandfather fought in the first world war, and his father in the second.  He felt it was also his duty to carry on the tradition. Taylor arrives in country with only a few other new recruits posted in his platoon.  Everyone expects him to know what to do and how to do it.  When the platoon is stationed on ""ambush"" in the jungle, they are the ones ambushed, by the Vietcong.  The ambush is unfairly blamed on Taylor, by people saying that it was his fault for sleeping.  In fact, his shift was over, and another soldier fell asleep on the job.  From there on, things get worse, and the platoon ends up burning a suspected Vietcong refuge village to the ground.  Sergeant Barnes shoots an old woman and is about to murder a child, when Sergeant Elias stops him.  Looting, rape, murder, and arson are all comitted by Americans in that village alone.  It is difficult to watch and you begin no to feel as much sympathy towards the Americans.  War is bad.  Plain and simple, and should be avoided at all costs.  Especially a different country's civil war, such as Vietnam.",

Defoe's character is shot twice almost point blank by Berringer and yet he manages to survive and stagger around, one assumes this is Stone's attempt at dragging emotion out of his audience, although the emotion was humor and not sadness.

215,6 January 2001,ding50,1, Another lie from Oliver Stone,"I'm both amused and disgusted by the people who claim that this movie is so accurate about Vietnam, and WERE NEVER THERE. This movie is about as true about the whole Vietnam war as the Rodney King beating is true about ALL police officers. Yes, bad things do (and did) happen, but in general the people there are just like you and me. They have morals, they are not killing machines, they do not all do drugs. Atrocities were the exception in Vietnam, not the rule. They happened far more infrequently than the ""hype"" would lead you believe. Oliver Stone has a knack for making movies that show the Vietnam war as this brutal bloodbath, but are based as much in reality as Star Wars. If you honestly believe the stereotypes of Vietnam, do yourself a favour and learn the truth. Fact: the Viet Cong and NVA did far worse things to the South Vietnamese than ANY soldier in the US Armed Forces ever did. Fact: the soldiers in World War II treated the enemy far worse in general than the soldiers in Vietnam did, and they were WELCOMED when they came home. The fine Americans who served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; though the war was badly fought from a political standpoint, no one could have asked for more from our soldiers, and it is a great disservice to assert that this kind of ""mostly true"" fiction is the way things really were there.",

217,25 January 2007,drystyx,10, throwback to the old war movies with extra punch,"""Platoon"" was definitely a throwback to the old war movies, with some extra punch added. It involves the characters more than most modern movies, and the characters are delineated. You can tell one from another in camera shots, unlike ""Hamburger Hill"", which is a melange of shots in which you can't possibly tell one character from another. It involves a protagonist who is also a throwback to the old war movie, a man out of of his element, learning to deal with people he usually didn't. He is a ""rich kid"", but a thoroughly likable, believable rich kid who does a lot of thinking. I'm sure you've already heard about the two NCOs whose names are synonyms for the kinds of soldiers they are ""Barnes"" and ""Lyle"". The acting, directing, and writing are all exceptional. The action and dialogue mingle in a very entertaining, logical, and informative process. What the film also shows is the way of life in that era. It is hard to think about supporting the ""Barnes"" point of view today in an era in which we are so well informed, but in the late sixties and seventies, when Americans were spoon fed only bits and pieces, even by the press (I was a high schooler then, and believe me, the war was downplayed. The killings and battles were described as small skirmishes then by the press.) Probably more than half of Americans would have been ""Barnes"" supporters then, while his supporters today would be the rich mercantile types, the very naive, and the very uneducated (in other words, Republicans). However, when Barnes kills the granny, he probably would have a bit more than half against him, and the film depicts this. Make no mistake, Barnes is the epitome of evil, however. And other characters more in the middle probably reflect how most people would react, Particularly O'Neil, who probably represents the actions most of us would have taken. Anyone who ever thought about being in combat has felt positive they would have done exactly what he did in battle, and would have said exactly the same words he said afterwards. One thing lost is the captain's guilt in all of this. He proclaims that he will investigate and prosecute illegal killing, but then proclaims ""Not now!"" and puts Lyle's life in jeopardy from his comrade quite knowingly. The captain is too smart to get caught, but his mercantile character should not be overlooked when teachers show this film to students. It is he, more than the junio officer, who is truly the ""butt buddy"" of Sgt. Barnes, allowing Barnes to deal life and death and play God. The movie makes clear how he even cheats his friends. He is no comrade, and all his actions are meant to get his comrades killed. The mood of the film is also magnificent. And after seeing it, I can't imagine anyone hearing ""Sweat of My Tears"" without thinking about it. The famous death scene of a certain main character gets the advertising it deserves for being so well made. I could go on for weeks about the assets of this film. The best war film since ""Jungle Fighters"", which was made in the same spirit.",

Action scenes are done very well as the come across as convincing and shocking.

Will Dafoe is a great actor and everybody is good here. Berenger is brutal and Sheen plays the perfect character for the role. An untainted soul that slowly corrupts during the awfulness of Nam.

223,4 September 2005,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8, Unpleasant but necessary,"War movies are very different. Usually, these differences depend on the film-makers' experience with war or knowledge of it. Occasionally, the time it was made and society's view towards it has its say in the matter too. This film was made by Oliver Stone, so naturally it's based on his experiences in the Vietnam war. Personally, I don't think there is a better war movie than All Quiet on the Western Front from 1979, simply because it's beautiful, concise and effective without simply showing lots of stuff blowing up or killing off characters we can relate to. Despite that, this film is still worth watching, simply due to how well-directed and intense it is. The plot is quite good, and follows a single platoon through a period in '67, during the Vietnam war. The pacing is good, though I felt that the film started somewhat slow only to later kick up to a very fast pace for a while. There didn't seem to be enough character development. I never picked up on all the names. Maybe there are too many major characters. That's something I often find in Stone's films, making them quite hard to sit through, and requiring more than one viewing to take it all in(which shouldn't be necessary... he's not Kubrick, after all). The acting is great. The casting is great, not one character seems miscast. The special effects are great. The characters are credible, interesting and well-written. The direction and editing is talented and effective. The film has a few memorable scenes, and the dialog contains a good bit of quotable lines. Not much else to say about the film... it's quite graphic and very direct, so you should only watch it if you're completely certain that you can take it. Oh, and John C. McGinley is excellent in the film. I recommend this to any fan of anyone involved in the making of the film, Oliver Stone in particular and fans of war movies. 8/10",

Platoon is a war film and I'm not crazy about war films in general but Stone's direction and personal experience with Vietnam is clearly an effective tool in this film's brilliance. It's raw, ugly, dirty, and filthy but then what war isn't any of those things? As far as Vietnam films, I preferred the Deer Hunter but I am going to say that Platoon goes further where other films have not gone before. It's different when the director has been there and done it himself as a Vietnam veteran like Roman Polanski who survived World War II POland as a child. There is nothing that they are not afraid to show as if they are holding something back. This film is about war and the young men who go only to return home differently. As far as I know, this film is still important today as it was twenty years ago. First rate cast include Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, and other young men.",

228,15 September 2005,jboothmillard,9, Platoon,"Based on his own experiences in it, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning director/writer Oliver Stone decided that he should create a representation of the war in Vietnam from what he can remember of it, obviously mixed with a story. Basically Charlie Sheen as Pvt. Chris Taylor helps lead a team of soldiers into the country to fight against all the enemies that they can find. They suffer losing men, trying to help them, arguing about stuff, e.g. betrayal, and much more incidences. Sheen looks exactly like his Dad (Martin, who was in the Vietnam film Apocalypse Now) and he is the best in the film. Accompanying him are Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Tom Berenger as Sgt. Bob Barnes, Oscar nominated Willem Dafoe as Sgt. Elias Grodin, Forest Whitaker as Big Harold, young Johnny Depp in his third film as Pvt. Gator Lerner and Candyman's Tony Todd as Sgt. Warren. It won the Oscar for Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Picture, and it was nominated Best Cinematography and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Stone, it won the BAFTA for Best Editing, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay.

232,13 October 2001,markguszak,10, The Greatest Vietnam War Movie Ever,"This film is timeless and describes the reality of the Vietnam war better than any other. This film is not hollywood and it is not surreal. It is reality. The film does try to be black and white and is not afraid to show the complexities facing fighting men in Vietnam. However, the real greatness of this film is in the gritty realism of the characters. Stone gathered a great and diverse collection of actors. Each character well developed and unique. In deed, the viewers are allowed to look at these characters and choose which one best represents them and in that, perhaps sees how they might have done in Vietnam. Charlie Sheen's character is innocence, heading for war. When he arrives in Vietnam, he must make the choice of what kind of soldier he will be. Will he emulate Sargent Barnes, a hardcore lifer that believes in killing them all and staying alive? Or will Sheen's character choose to join the souls under Sargent Elias, a compassionate veteran, who realizes that American soldiers are still human beings and should act as such. The greatness of this film, is that the choice is not cut and dry. Barnes represents the frustration of many grunts in Vietnam. The frustration of seeing many friends die and not knowing who your enemy is. The frustration of being placed in a foreign land and not knowing how to win. Many young men see Barnes as their savior, the man that will kill the enemy and keep them alive. Although Barnes is evil, one can see why men would be attracted to him. However, for many, Barnes is the worst of what war turns people into. These optimists cling to their humanity and to Elias, a Christ-like figure that attempts to keep the souls of those young soldiers pure. This film takes the viewer to Vietnam and puts them in the jungle. It shows us why we would never ever want to be there. It shows us many different and diverse characters, some we relate with, others that we abhor. It shows why Vietnam was unique and why we were not able to win there. It is not a fun film to watch, but war is never fun. Great film that comes as close to perfection as any film can. Great performance and great direction. See it!",

It became his most critically acclaimed of the three war epics, and one of his most acclaimed films of all time.

Stand out images: obviously that of Defoe, arms stretched to the sky as the outstanding music soars, but one of my favourites is the post napalm scene, when the jungle changes colour. Brilliant.

Brilliant performances by Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, John C McGinley (who adds a bit of comic relief).

The plot is very consistent and achieves what it aims. Today (December 2002) it has not lost its lessons, new generations have still a lot to learn watching this film. In addition of the excellent work of the director Oliver Stone, it is also important to acknowledge the serious work of Willen Dafoe, Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen, perhaps in his best performance. Fighting scenes were conducted very accurately, sometimes one may feel that you are inside them and risking also your life. The environment was the typical tropical one, vegetation, landscape, etc.",

Only someone with a first-hand combat experience could have pulled it all off so convincingly.

The story centers around a rich boy (Charlie Sheen) who goes to fight in Vietnam, because he feels the poor and downtrodden of america shouldn't be the only one's fighting for our country. While in Vietnam we see the transformation of Sheeen's character from the ignorant child he was into a real soldier. This comes at the hands of two sargents who have opposing ideas on the treatment of people in a Vietnam village. The two sargents played by Willam DaFoe and Tom Berenger, idealize the typical types of people in Vietnam, those in control, and those who are real leaders. Sheen turns in an absolutely stunning portrayal of a newbie grunt, while the supporting cast does a magnificent job to add life to the brutal story. Stone did some of his best work in this movie demontrating a brutally real picture of the Vietnam war. This movie should be a must see for any one with a television set and a VCR.",

The realism didn't come up to par, the character development didn't strike at the heart, it just didn't seem like that great a movie.

253,20 May 2000,seancolins,2, Disrespectful to an honorable people,"The first scene is of recruits landing in Vietnam. Among them is an  enlisted soldier (Charlie Sheen) who we follow throughout the film.  Sheen does this because he thinks it's the decent thing to do. When he  gets to Vietnam he is in horror. Of course any good war film would show  horror, but this one would rather just do that than show some respect.  Every word in the film is practically **** and the soldiers' attitudes  are terrible. There is a scene when they go through a village and  slaughter civilians. Now of course Mey Li is true, but unless your  making a movie about that, or only disrespecting some soldiers you  should keep your mouth shut. Oliver Stone decides because he was in Nam  for a year that all Vietnam War soldiers were a terrible evil force.  When the soldiers of Vietnam got home, arrogant, idiot protesters  condemed them. This film is a bunch of worthless protesters. A lot of  them knew that they were fighting for nothing, yet they still did it  anyway because their country asked them to. These honorable men go  through so much, and what do they get besides ever lasting respect that  they deserve? Trash thrown at them like this movie.  Besides being disrespectful it is also depressing beyond belief. Now of  course it's okay to have depressing war films, (""Apocalypes Now"" was a  masterpiece) but this film has empty depressents. Maybe that last scene  was suppose to touch people, but it just tried to make something that  it was not. When was it ever in the books that Americans fought against  themselves viciously?  If you want to develop a disrespect for very honorable people and make  yourself totally depressed go out and get ""Platoon."" If you want to see  a great version of what Vietnam was I urge you to go out and get  Francis Ford Coppalas epic ""Apocalypse Now"" or for good respect of  Vietnam War veterans see ""Hamburger Hill."" Don't even think that this  film has any right to be the least bit near at all to Steven Speilbergs  epic ""Saving Private Ryan."" Platooon definitely didn't deserve that  Oscar.",

This is my favorite war movie because it shows how it really was because its partially based on oliver Stones own experience in the vietnamese war.It shows the unglamourous war being fought by these young men and all of the wars uglinesses,The effect of war on the human body, The war which nobody really believed in.",

""Platoon"" was brilliantly acted and directed, taking in several awards in 1986 including ""Best Picture."" Charlie Sheen gives an outstanding performance as a young Vietnam soldier who not only battles the enemy, but the fear within himself. Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger do an excellent job of portraying sergeants who are in conflict. What makes this film so great is the realism brought out within the movie. Oliver Stone (writer and director), really does a great job of showing the effects the war had on the soldiers. Stone having been in Vietnam himself, shows a soldiers' point-of-view of the war being not only a shattering physical obstacle, but also a mental one. ""Platoon"" is a drama that gives you an experience of the horror that was Vietnam. The brutality of the scenes and the intensity of the characters help maintain an idea of the paranoia and fear the war caused. This movie is never disappointing and always keeps you interested. The excellent writing and superb acting makes this film hard to forget. I recommend this film to everybody, even if you don't find interest in war. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 9. This film is rated R for strong language and violence.",

Platoon is a movie that drops you straight into the war and within five minutes of seeing the film, you feel like your there with the soldiers. The film follows a young soldier (Sheen) who volunteered and his struggles as he is torn apart between two sergeants. The best praise I can give to this film is it's ability to totally engross you in almost every character in the platoon. There are some very disturbing parts in the film, but they are only placed there to show the true horror of war and the affects it can have on men.

Perhaps, this is the reason why some scenes were cut with Johnny Depp. Actually, was really painful to watch it, because there were some inhumanely cruel scenes. But this is reality, history. And it's very good that director and actors did their job fantastically. Not unnecessarily rating is high. I don't really like films about war, but there are two good things about it. When this genre of film is appointed for war heroes, it's really very nice. It makes me to pause and think about those people. Second thing - I love facts. And facts were in this film. Chosen music ,of course, revealed mood. This movie made me to be tense. To be quite honest, I have never watched a film about war. ""Platoon"" was the first. But now I know how should look good film about war. One more thing, that scene with thunder was amazing, it gave me the shudders. I really was empathized. My heart bit together with characters' hearts. Plot is full of stress, it's very complicated and tense, it shows the reality, as I said. Also, was sad and tearful to see how brutally soldiers behaved with those poor Vietnameses. Actually, I always said that Charlie Sheen isn't good actor, because after ""Scary movie 5"" he looked ""to cheap"" for me. But I changed my mind. Now I think that he's really very good actor.

The conflict between Willem Dafoe's character and Tom Berenger's character gets a little too cartoonish and too convenient at times. Charlie Sheen does an OK job. I have been told that pretty much every aspect of this movie is accurate. Dale Dye, an actual Vietnam soldier and advisor, acted as well to add some realism to this piece. The soundtrack is another bummer in this movie as well. There are no period-authentic pieces, like on Forest Gump with Fortunate Son.

Yet in spite of the crassness of his eye, the movie tells the story of Vietnam in a manner that communicates the complexities of the war to average movie goers.  If we juxtapose Stone's handling of the Mi Lai massacre with Coppola's metaphorical scene of the slaughter of innocents by the boat crew in Apocalypse Now, you see the difference between the art film making and the ""art"" of self righteous cinematic flotsam.  Yet on a real level, Platoon was released during the heat of Reganism and the nationalist chest pounding that went along with it.  Society was swallowing the palled justifications for world wide police actions easier than trickle down economic theory.  In this vein, this hyperbolic reminder of the last great feat of American nationalism run amok was well timed. Unfortunately, this film gave Stone the credibility with which he bashed us with such gems as ""Wall street"", ""Born on the Fourth of July"", and the seminal example of the girth of his ego, ""JFK"".

My best friend, Randy, served two tours of duty in Vietnam in the late 1960s, and because of these reports he was hesitant to see the film. Ultimately he attended a screening in the company of some two dozen other vets who sat together to provide each other with support. When the film was over they looked at each other. ""Great film,"" they said. ""But it wasn't like that. Not really."" Then they all went out for coffee and argued over some of the movie's technical details. Randy says he has never met any vet who had a flashback episode from viewing PLATOON, and he regards the story as so much Hollywood hype. Whether the stories of flashbacks are true or not, one thing is clear: PLATOON does not capture the Vietnam experience for all vets, and it seems unlikely that any one film ever could.",

A war where many had no idea why we were there. The conditions were horrible. We fought in jungles and stomped around in rice paddies and couldn't tell the enemy from the ally. Also, we now had peoplewho wanted to profiteer from the whole thing. ""As long as I'm forced to be here, I may as well make the best of it."" It also led to cruel treatment of friends as well as enemies. In this movie I'll always remember the arrival scene at the beginning--new people, strangers in a strange land--looking at the tired faces of those already embedded.

290,11 July 2013,s13ky,8, Platoon is certainly one of the best films about Vietnam War and Oliver Stone's best.,"If we talk about the war in Vietnam, we should talk about Platoon. It is certainly one of the best films about Vietnam War and in my opinion, it's absolutely Oliver Stone's best film since JFK and Nixon. Overall, apart from the credibility of the film director and also the authenticity in the depiction of the war, I find the screenplay, editing and film direction stand out above all, not to forget the all star casts of two famous method actors, Tom Berenger (possibly his best performance ever) and Willem Dafoe. To be honest, deep within my heart, ""Platoon"" ranked somewhere among ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""The Deer Hunter"" (the latter isn't a war film) because of its raw visualization of the war horror that some consider a crime against humanity. I always get carried away by the spectacular music scoring, saddening, beautiful as well as frightening. The best music sequence would be ""Adagio For Strings"" by Samuel Barber and it's your task to find out which sequence. Oliver Stone really did well in bringing us the rich psychological portraits of soldiers who fought the popular war from a very interesting perspective, through the eyes of a rookie soldier (Charlie Sheen) who volunteered to defend his country, in a fight against communism. We witness the harsh time they faced as soon as they landed on the Saigon combat zone, in the jungle, with a simple mission of staying alive from day to day. The line between good and evil is the spot where Oliver Stone places the personal stories of the men whose horror and fear were their daily foods, real men who fought and died in the Vietnam War. This unnecessary war was taped in brutal realism. Awesome combat scenes, frank, hard and strangely beautiful. Robert Richardson as the cinematographer created a jaw-dropping atmosphere combining gray and bleak apocalyptic tones of the great wild landscapes. In conclusion, this is one of the greatest war films of cinema history, it contains some moving scenes and offers a realistic and cruel story of one of the greatest atrocities of humanity: wars.",

But when he had a private viewing of Platoon for Vietnam vets, and some of them were in tears, he knew he had done it right. The story of Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) and his road from innocence to be forced to do terrible things, are Stones own experience. And it hits hard. This is NOT John Wayne. This is napalm over villages, rape and killing. I specially remember a line Kevin Dillon has in the movie. Most of all it's a power struggle between the commanding sargeants Elias (Willem Dafoe) and Barnes (Tom Berenger). Two very different men, indeed. It's easy to hate Barnes troughout the movie, but Stone never flinch from the hard dilemma; even if Barnes is both evil and sadistic, is he a necessary evil in a war that takes no prisoners? One of the best, maybe THE best movie made about Vietnam. Stone's best movie, IMO. Specially regarding he hardly had a budget.

Once the draft set-in, it was all down-hill, because the younger the soldiers were, the more unprepared they were for jungle-warfare- maybe all those guys who went to Canada had insights the other grunts didn't, plus officers who were totally unprepared for combat and useless at trying to lead. Kids who had just graduated from high-school and were reveling in their budding manhood, from owning their first automobile certainly weren't ready to leave the nest of home and fight in a savage jungle. AND - I want to correct ""Polaris_P.b"" for saying there were too many Black soldiers in the movie - wake-up, guy: that race was the most vulnerable to be drafted and volunteering, because they had no future to look forward to.

This is actually rather intelligent, both in its plot and technical execution. It's the Vietnam War, we follow a platoon of US soldiers as they attempt to wipe out the enemy. The question that this film raises is: who really is the enemy? You have the conflict of the war itself (America against Vietnam) but within the platoon is a conflict for authority. Split between what is right and what is wrong, the moral implications of this war have taken effect on several soldiers as they question their choices. This was a smart element to include within the plot, it was easier to establish character development and build some tension. The majority of the characters were sufficiently developed and their personalities had charisma. This was mostly down to the great cast. Willem Dafoe was easily the best performance, Tom Berenger was also decent and the heated chemistry between them was well conveyed. Oliver Stone's direction was solid, very realistic and gritty. The makeup effects were practical, the wounds and blown up limbs looked pretty damn realistic. A standout scene was the raiding of the Vietnamese village. This was the turning point where actually the American side were perceived as the antagonists, clearly communicating with our inner moral compasses. Effective, very effective.

304,8 March 2007,zennokangae,10," Perhaps the Most Important Film of the 1980s, One of American Cinema's Finest","I remember when this movie released nationally when I was only a kid. I'm only in my 30s and was still a toddler when the evacuation of Saigon commenced, however I have been touched by the Vietnam Conflict in many areas of my personal life. Having viewed this feature over and again, it wasn't until I watched Charles Keyselyak's documentary on the making of this film when I realized and remembered the full scope of this magnificent piece of American cinema (one of the view to win best feature as well as best director). As one user on this board illuminated, Platoon, ""was also a success at the box office grossing $250,000,000 world wide, making it the third highest grossing film of 1986."" One of those three films was the jingoistic piece of fluff ""Top Gun""; a film so anathema in tone to Platoon and iconic of the Reagan-Era. It was a privilege to view this film as a 12 year old boy and I went on to study History at the graduate level, this film contributing greatly to my ambition to understand how these moments, brutal periods in history transpire. My first employer had been shot up on an armored personnel carrier on the Cambodian border, my best friend's father had served in a tank company and was very troubled emotionally and the man who helped my family adopt my younger sister from South Korea lost both legs to an anti- personnel mine. I'll never forget seeing, at the time, adult men leaving one of the theaters in my home town weeping. I didn't understand what was going on at the time, but this is one of the most poignant memories I carry of this film and its impact. Sadly, Stone says in the documentary on the film that he hopes younger generations will be smarter, ""when some politician tries to sell them a used war like this one"".

Great work from Oliver Stone it shows the emotions, anger, and violence of war.","Director Oliver Stone drawing on his own experience from his days as a solider in Vietnam, scores a big hit here in 1986 with ""Platoon"" a brutal war drama with conflict about. Chris Taylor(Charlie Sheen) is a young man who's dropped out of college for the love of his country so he goes off to fight in Vietnam. Of course the big enemy is the Viet Cong, yet so much more is at stake and much is learned during this brutal tour. This film is just perfect the way it shows how intense and brutal war can be, as evidenced by the bloody and ambush attack scenes, as a viewer can feel the hurt, pain and exhaustion of the soldiers. This platoon company has plenty of conflicts, differences of opinion, and culture problems all within themselves. Those themes and problems make this film all the more important as the viewer will come to value life just like the central character of Chris Taylor. The performances given from Sheen is good but fails in comparison to his two commanding officers played by Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe, especially Berenger's is outstanding because he's so direct and serious. You will find plenty of pot smoking, foul language, and death with this picture, but that's just typical stuff in war. After it all a viewer should feel proud to a solider and hold them in high value because they help provide our countries freedom of life. Great film and well deserving of the 1986 best picture.",
310,19 April 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6, It's with Stone's slightly journalistic slant that this honest Vietnam War flick finds its footing.,"It's with Stone's slightly journalistic slant that this Vietnam War film finds its footing as a more accurate and honest depiction of a well-publicised conflict, one that's clearly informed by the director's own experiences and his understandable desire to portray them in an unbiased, truthful way often not done in favour of more patriotic fare. Yet, 'Platoon (1986)' still suffers from the almost clip-show mentality most war pictures tend to adopt, even though it is told from the perspective of the soldiers in a very 'boots-on-the-ground' kind of way and isn't concerned with the larger picture of generals moving pieces on a proverbial chessboard. Thankfully, an inner struggle soon starts to emerge within the titular platoon and it is this, along with the individual development of the characters and how they handle the impossible situations they are placed in, that forms the basis for the overarching story. The piece always manages to maintain at least some semblance of narrative amongst the battles and boredom of long-form infantry life. 6/10",

We Were Soldiers and Platoon are my two favorite Vietnam war films because of the gruesome action and it makes me have very high respect for war veterans. Oliver Stone did a fantastic job on showing the terrors of war and how it can drive people literally insane.

If you haven't seen this movie, it is a must-see and don't listen to all those Platoon haters, they must not have respect for the war veterans....because this movie shows exactly what they had to go through in the battles. I always watch this movie on memorial day....its truly amazing.",
312,25 June 2020,dr_clarke_2,9, Visceral and powerful,"Oliver Stone is not a director known for his subtlety. But Platoon - Stone's 1986 Academy Award for Best Picture winner - isn't intended to be subtle. Inspired by his own experiences in the Vietnam War, Stone's movie takes the simple message that war is hell and then shows is that on screen with visceral and powerful results.
The story follows the members of the eponymous platoon on a tour of duty in Vietnam and shows the effects that the conflict has on them. This isn't a film that seeks to directly address the politics of America's involvement in the conflict, although it indirectly does so by showing some of the appalling behaviour inflicted on Vietnamese villagers by the strung-out, battle-crazed soldiers. Instead, it focuses on the soldiers themselves and is focalised through Charlie Sheen's Taylor, new to Vietnam and soon caught between Tom Berenger's psychotic Bob Barnes and Willem Dafoe's more principled Elias Grodin in a sort of battle for his sole.
Stone's screenplay shows the chaos and horror that surrounds these men in relentless fashion. Lieutenant Wolfe's incompetence results in the deaths of some of his own men, whilst Bunny beats a Vietnamese youth to death in a fit of rage; even Taylor is so tightly wound he makes the boy ""dance"" first by firing bullets at his feet. Barnes kills an innocent Vietnamese woman and a couple of his troops are interrupted whilst attempting to rape others; there is nothing heroic about many of these men. Taylor, who dropped out of college to volunteer for the army, is better educated than most ""grunts"" and his narrative examines his feelings to what he experiences: at the end he muses, ""We did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves."" Stone doesn't ask if men like Bunny - who admits that enjoys the war and the fact that it allows him to do whatever he want - have been corrupted by their experiences, or were like that all along. Barnes, who thrives in the chaos of the war and murders Elias to protect himself, embodies this idea.
The battles are short, bloody and violent. The film is strewn with corpses, many of them dismembered. Stone's vision is of a hell of man's own making. To try and reflect this on screen, Stone reportedly subjected his cast to a rigorous and unpleasant-sounding military-style regimen to make them authentically weary and stressed before filming, and its shows. All the cast members convince: Sheen is impressive, and sounds authentically exhausted in the voice-over, whilst Tom Berenger is disturbingly believable as Barnes. All of the soldiers look and sound stressed out, from Elias to John C. McGinley's O'Neill and Forest Whitaker's Big Harold.
Robert Richardson was nominated for a Best Cinematography Oscar for his work here, and it's not to understand why. He often uses close-ups that capture the sweat, the grime and the endless crawling insects, and during the fighting, the camera is in constant motion and fast cuts are used to create a disorienting impression of chaos. Elias's death after he's been left for dead by Barnes is shot in aerial long-shot and then in slow motion for added emphasis. The location filming on the Philippine island of Luzon looks both gorgeous and humid and sweaty: this is, of course, the point. The finishing touch is Georges Delerue's soundtrack, which includes diagetic and non-diagetic music from (more or less) the Vietnam War era, whilst Samuel Barber's ""Adagio for Strings"" plays over a scene in which a Vietnamese village is torched for no good reason whatsoever, juxtaposing beauty with barbarity in a way that reflects the lush forest setting torn apart by carnage.
Platoon was not the first film to be set during the Vietnam War, and nor was it the last. But as a film that tries to capture what the experience of the Vietnam War film was actually like for the soldiers who fought in it and what it did to them, it is certainly one of the most powerful.",

316,4 October 2012,dansview,7, Watch With Mental Filter,"Remember that Oliver Stone has a reputation for being wildly Left Wing, with regard to the war in particular. He really stacks the deck in this one. He makes sure you know that only the lower classes fought, that any given platoon was filled with murderous sadists, that everyone smoked weed and drank, and that almost no one believed in the cause, except the one evil guy. Also remember that this is a movie starring Charlie Sheen, narrating what it's like to be in the jungles of Vietnam. Does that remind you of something? Yes, his dad already did that in Apocalypse Now, 7 years earlier. So that draws away from the originality of this one. But I did like the central conflict of a nice Sergeant versus a barbaric, yet effective one. Both were brave and effective soldiers, employing very different tactics. Before I get to the repeated sadism, let me remind everyone that the war was not just about some lower class American guys shooting up some local Asian peasants in funny hats. America was fighting the superpowers of China and the U.S.S.R., who were backing the North Vietnamese, and who had designs on world domination. Also remember that Communism murdered millions upon millions of people, including Cambodians, once the Americans went home. I think the movie did do a decent job of showing you the dialog and daily mannerisms of low class men, when left alone. In most cases, whomever you were back home, will still be with you in the jungle. If you were the type of guy who shirked responsibility or blamed others for your mistakes, or you were self-indulgent, or lazy, etc., you will be that at war too. Interestingly there is only one Christian depicted, and that is a quiet Hispanic Catholic soldier who never speaks. I would think that in real life, even many uneducated, small town soldiers would still be Christians. The two Sergeants were too old to be draftees. So they were career military. But they act like common soldiers. Even though Sergeants are not officially ""Officers,"" a career soldier might be more conservative that the way these guys were portrayed. I'll grant the fact that Stone was apparently a soldier there himself, and I was not. I don't doubt that some of the clichés you see in these movies are true. But they just tend to be one-sided. Tom Berenger was excellent, as was Willem Dafoe. Despite what a weird guy Sheen wound up becoming in real life, I have to say that I like him in those 80s movies. There was something very natural about his acting. I don't think Johnny Depp even spoke in this one, and Kevin Dillon played the same kind of guy he would wind up playing for the next quarter century. The gung-ho dumb-dumb. Music was not employed with the same degree of effectiveness in this one, as it was in Apocalypse Now. Too violent for me, but I did like the way the picture showed the daily frustrations of lack of sleep, leeches, personality conflicts, and fear.",

Caught in the middle is the newbie Taylor who got more than he signed up for. Charlie Sheen gives a good portrayal of constant tiredness and mistreatment, however I think he was miscast as he exudes a deadpan, casual, comedic tone at times.

I have since been plagued by people insisting that it is the greatest film of its genre so I decided to watch it again and give it another chance. My original impressions were correct. Some of the acting in this film is truly awful (John C. McGinley, for example, is consistently weak throughout). Also there are some serious questions to be asked of the dialogue. The major problem with the film, however, is the the plot in general and the characters that are central to it. The blatant juxtaposition of Sgt. Barnes with Sgt. Grodin trivialises the atrocities that are committed in war. The gross simplification of the issues by Stone here is actually quite irritating. If one wants to look at a war film that deals with the horrors without being overly sentimental (note Barber's Adagio!) then I would suggest The Deer Hunter.",

I think what really astounded me was the sheer brilliance of the depicted nightmarish battle scenes. But what is especially appealing about ""Platoon"", I think, is the way in which Stone deglamourises war,while simultaneously giving the viewer an exhilarating, claustrophobic, and ultimately cathartic experience.In turn I felt both thrilled and horrified, emotionally evoked and saddened.  Particularly moving scenes,to name a few, which the viewer can never forget, include the village, Elias' death, and the apocalyptic ending- when the perimeter is overrun. The acting too is top class. Charlie Sheen's Taylor gives a credible performance as Stone's alter ego, but especial praise must go to Tom Berenger's depiction of the war scarred Barnes, and  Willem Defoe's sensitive Elias, as well as supporting roles, such as Kevin Dillon's sadistic Bunny, and Chris' big brotherly Keith David as King,all make up the tragedy and horror that was Vietnam.

Yes, ""Platoon"" still succeeds in capturing the fear, the unpredictability, and the uncertainty that comes into effect when you're in the war. However, Oliver Stone's other war themed follow-ups become more stylized in contrast to the substance that this film delivers.

The things that lack quite a bit are the sound and visual effects. The sound doesn't really give the real feel of stereo location placing, a technology that wasn't yet available. Yet the visual effects look somewhat too much forced, like we see on the lightning scene. The use of throwing flares in firefights is quite stupid since the damage of the unseen bullets are not really visible aside from what the makeup depicted.

Great performances by Charlie Sheen and my favourite, Willem, made this movie stand out. I couldn't believe it had been in my cupboard my whole life and I had missed it! It really IS the greatest war film EVER! My favourite scenes include the part where all the guys get 'high' and are dancing to 'Tracks of my Tears' which I am listening to at this very moment. Also, the scene where Elias is killed is possibly the best one. It is so touching, yet scary, and it had me screaming at Barnes and crying at our TV.

355,22 August 2008,bandw,9," Intense, difficult","Most will find this ultra realistic Vietnam war story a difficult film to watch, especially those who lived through that era. I had put off seeing this all these years since I was afraid of the memories it would bring back, and I was never even in the service. One of the few statements that Dick Cheney has made that I identify with is, ""I had other priorities in the '60s than military service."" Truth be told staying out of Vietnam was a priority of mine, as well as most of my friends - the specter of the draft was always there. Student deferments were the method of choice for accomplishing avoidance for a lot of kids. But then in 1969 came the draft lottery - every day of the year was assigned a number and the lower your number the more exposed you were to being drafted. The lottery was televised and I remember sitting in a large room with about sixty guys and hearing the groans as the low numbers were drawn out of the hopper. This was truly a surreal experience, a mild version of Russian roulette. Many of those with low numbers opted for the method of last resort - flight to Canada. I offer this memory as but one that this film triggered. Almost everyone who lived through the Vietnam war era was scarred by it - few got off scott-free, including of course the countries involved (estimated U.S. deaths 58,000, with 300,000 wounded; estimated Vietnam deaths in excess of one million). The wounds are still healing.",

The actions of anyone in the Platoon can be justified. It is not known how each of us would act in their place.

366,26 December 2010,andy-933-696608,9, Platton movie review,"It's both invoking in the plot, but more engaging with its uniquely believable characters. Oliver stone directs a master piece of both modern, and psychological warfare, embarking on a quest where its focused soldiers must an enemy far greater than the gooks, themselves. It's very strange that when we fight a known enemy any actions, no matter how cruel or vile, they seem normal. However when we fight amongst ourselves, all goes to hell. In the time of the film, our apparent hero Chris Taylor (Sheen) narrates both his feelings, his clarifications, as well as his doubts on the subject of the war. As Taylor walks us through his own experience of the Hell that once made go into an infinite panic, we all get brief but accurate glimpses of the true Vietnam. If many people believed that being a soldier back then was a proud honor, no matter what unit, or what position they were placed in, then they were dead wrong. It was nothing more and nothing less. The grunts were able to take it , on the account that they were nothing before they had the military. It's quite graphic and yet enjoyable to watch as Oliver Stone digs deep into what many soldiers were like back then. Vietnam was a very difficult time, not just for this country, but for the very men fighting in it. In their gaze of that very Hell they resorted to drug use out of a necessity to escape that endless cold reality of death, and what struck me as intrigued was just how believable the characters were. They all felt screwed over in whatever way the war ,or the military had done to them. Some used their own moral compass to make actions any sane human would easily hesitate to make. The very performance by Tom Beranger as Sgt. Barnes was incredible, as he represented a soldier who has had his good time in Vietnam well enough to see how and what he can do. He gazes on the very pot heads he commands, saying he is reality, only to have viewers assume that he feels no repent for his less than prominent actions. Sgt. Allias (Daffoe) is portrayed as the more rational soldier, whom like Barnes understands the nature of how much insanity defines the very war they are fighting, while still maintaining his own dignity as a human being and not a murderer with authority. Its very clear that the established rivalry among these two Sergeants divides soldiers into two different sides, making the Gooks the least of their problems. Basically the film portrays Vietnam as general Vietnam. Early 5 a.m. wake up, daily digging and humping, and all night watches through dark infested Jungles. It's all very clear at just how little the gooks were as the enemy, for the true battle was between themselves. As Taylor's character goes through more improved developments, responding more commonly to the very site of war, everything becomes more clear to him. That very knowledge has given him the assurance that he can use what he learned in his experience as guidance, knowing he will never be the same again. Taylor came to Vietnam as a college dropout with very little Ambition, and he came out with more than an experience, but a forever lasting mark of the true nature of war. ""Platoon"" is a riveting war drama, combining a brilliant form of direction as Oliver Stone maintains focus on the elements of the Vietnam war, out of respect for those who died, and delivers characters that are very common and yet very unique by the personalities that define them. ""Platoon"" gives viewers a deeper look into what goes on inside the platoon, rather than what is outside it.",
367,19 February 2004,agmoldham,7, Not easy viewing,"Platoon is uncomfortable viewing. The film focuses on Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) who is a new recruit to Vietnam.

It had some very strong scenes, especially the Vietnamese village-part. They could have made this film much better, but because it was going to be a mainstream film, I don't think they had the guts.

The dialog is terrible, the emotions feel fake and the acting feels forced, and it creeps along at an almost unbearable pace.

I've sat through many war films that claimed to be great,with Hamburger Hill (sad acting),Full Metal Jacket (not bad,but seemed more like two separate stories and dragged on at times),Thin Red Line (great potential but very boring) and Saving Private Ryan (which was good but was certainly no Platoon). Realizing what era Vietnam was during,may help some viewers see that yes drugs were around and used (giving what pressure and confusion amassed during that time period) and the 'unknown enemy' syndrome in 'Nam,you can see how a young soldier would 'lose it' and end up killing innocents;not knowing the difference.

I understand the reason for the gritty close to the ground camerawork. To inspire realistic portrayals, however, it felt a little sloppy to me. It seemed more like the works of a Micheal Bay, not Oliver Stone. Now I've never really been fond of Oliver Stone, he's ok but there's plenty of better directors out there. And I feel that his more artistic side was underutilized here. The war is little in put, like a skirmish between the same 30 people, the villain is a caricature of bad guy military men. The main character is ok but I feel Charlie sheen wasn't the best choice, as well as all the other characters being ignored and or underdeveloped. It's a good movie if your looking for that kinda gritty nonsensical war picture. But I guess for a more ""pretentious"" cinema goer like me, it just wants my cup of tea.",

The reality of the war and the horror of the war, but the fact that the commanders are always at the base instead of the front line was strangely horrifying to me. Moreover, the fact that they were drinking Coca-Cola was even scarier. That's how I got the sense that this war is a reality. And...
Every single episode in this movie, and every single human conflict. Even in such an extreme situation, there is a people who try to crush their friends whom they don't like.
When you take war as a subject matter, it tends to be an action movie about war, but this movie was not like that.

This film is also excellent on a much deeper, metaphorical level. Upon multiple viewings, it becomes apparent that Elias represents Jesus Christ (good) and Barnes represents Satan (evil) which creates a whole new level of interest in the film.

Tom Berenger gives the performance of a lifetime opposite Willem Defoe, who by far also gives an Oscar-worthy performance.  Combined with superb direction of the dark jungles of Vietnam, this movie takes viewers into the world of that war, and illustrates the grittiness and determination (along with luck) it took to survive while showing the internal struggles of all the men.

It lacked a clear structure (the story was all over the place and felt inconsistent at times), there was basically no character development, and the special effects were laughable, to say the least. All of the explosions in the movie looked like fireworks going off. I kid you not. There were some scenes that I really liked but I can't get over the fact that they were followed up by fireworks explosions. In some scenes even the projectiles were replaced by ""fireworks"".

In fact I disliked most if not all of them, there's nothing to go off that makes you feel for any of them. They're flat out boring as far as they're presented. Charlie Sheen for example, cast as the soft rich kid was unbelievable and distracting throughout. It had a dull pace and the many firefight scenes had no substance and brought me out of the movie just waiting for them to end because they were just like any other 80s shoot em up scenes out there, comparable to Walker Texas Ranger.

The stance on Vietnam is not really clear or as defined as say 'Apocalypse Now' and such has an impact on the film. At times there's almost documentary-esque footage of massacres and in fighting between characters which are juxtaposed in ridiculous and jarring fashion with ridiculous side plots such as the Elias death fake out and then the iconic killing scene of Dafoe's character which seemed to be there for a spectacle manner. Again in fashion that's worlds apart from similar films it adopts a smaller scale approach to all forms of conflict and character which in fairness does give the idea that people are stepping on each other's toes and such there's believable rivalry/conflict which sadly occurs few and far between. Character wise Dafoe somehow shines and steals the show as Sheen doesn't offer as much charisma as his father did in Apocalypse Now and the 'quasi-villains' in Barnes and his supporters are frail. Ultimately there's not a real threat, the characters aren't gauged particularly well over the arc of the film but there's the odd redeeming quality, it for one feels alive and suits the journal re-telling style of which it adopts and visually at times is quite stunning and iconic with the aforementioned Elias death becoming a sliver of cinematic history. For as much there is negative it has a balance of positive aspects too and such is hard to draw conclusions about",

It's more propaganda to see the ""Vietcong"" just as communist threat...they mainly recruited themselves from the resistance against the French colonial forces...a just reason to fight and especially the Americans should have understood that. That was also the hope of the Vietnamese resistance but instead of supporting their claim the Americans replaced the hated French after they finally were driven out of Vietnam.
The people of Vietnam haven't asked for the French to occupy them...and they didn't really ask the Americans for their kind of help either.
What unites both American and Vietnamese soldiers is that they were mainly just tools in other persons plans. Every dead no matter the side he was fighting on was one too much. And I feel as sad for any American dead as I do for the Vietnamese. But the real victims had been the civil population of Vietnam suffering by the military actions and crimes of both sides.

After watching this film I feel that the director and scriptwriting must have been soldiers under the grassroots, checked the results.
It points to a common problem in the cultivation of world-class military personnel: the officers produced by the academies are not close enough to the actual combat, cannot mingle with the grass-roots soldiers, and have no authority.
From my perspective, the film for a few details to describe this phenomenon, the platoon platoon leader - that is, lieutenant Ralph is completely built on stilts, the superior orders, Barnes bypass him directly to other monitor command sergeant, he besides watch privately expressed their anger can't do anything, in daily life he tried to become one with soldiers, soldiers are the extremely, he is often too can not let go.
In the end, he randomly ordered the shelling and was stripped of command by Barnes. He was dissatisfied but helpless and even indifferent to everything.

Yet, there just isn't enough emotional prowess to warrant a feeling of sympathy for what the characters are subjected to. I am not knocking this film though, I thought it was an entertaining piece of work and a strong comment on the atrocities of war.  However, I do not think it is Stone's best film.  JFK is his best, and Platoon ranks to me alongside of Born On the 4th, Talk Radio and The Doors.  Natural Born Killers was even better than Platoon.

421,30 April 1999,Lara5,6," Overrated, partly inaccurate but good viewing.","Filmmakers have a huge responsibility when making historical films, as their film is all most viewers will see on that period or event, and it can shape the viewers perception of it. In Platoon, Oliver Stone tackled the subject of the Vietnam War, and by saying his film was autobiographical ensured more people took it as the gospel truth on what really happened in Vietnam. Actually, it has been proved that he did not experience many of the events of the film, such as the village incident. The biggest inaccuracy of this film is the fact that everything befalling this one platoon would not, could not and did not happen in the time span of this film. During nearly all patrols in reality the enemy was hardly ever seen or heard. The biggest problem an ordinary GI would face was boredom. Also, contrary to what Stone would like everyone to think, not everyone in Vietnam was a drunk or doper. In addition, I find it hard to believe that Chris Taylor would write home to his grandmother such truths as ""Somebody once wrote: Hell is the impossibility of reason. That's what this place feels like: Hell."" Likewise, his voiceover at the end commenting that his platoon's biggest problem was fighting itself, was a little simplistic, especially in view of the bodies of the final battle and other enemy encounters.",

Having watched Entourage and enjoying it, except for Dillon, he also caused my 7/10 score for Platoon. It was just Johnny Drama in Vietnam and Entourage was Bunny survives the war (unfortunately) and goes to Hollywood. Dillon in everything I have watched him in, is a stiff, cardboard cutout of someone that should be there but didn't show up.

Sgt. Barnes, a combat-loving burnout is the informal leader of the lifers, and Sgt. Elias, a free spirit, leads the latter group. When the platoon takes some gruesome losses while on an o.p., an enraged Barnes kills some Vietnamese who may or may not have been VC and orders the burning of their village, outraging the temporarily absent Elias. As the conflict between these two reaches its tragic denouncement, Chris must decide what he really values.",

He shows us a bunch of mainly poor people, a drug taking behaviour beyond the border of the acceptable and military leaders that are anything else than exemplary. But this film wants much more to be a vivid documentation of reality. Stone wants us to feel the deadly insects on our own skins, he wants us to feel the heat, he wants us to feel the fear, what it must be like to sit in the middle of an unknown jungle knowing that the enemy is going to attack any second. He wants all of this, so that the viewer can at least get a glimpse why the soldiers are carrying out this horrible massacre. He doesn't want to apologize it, but give us a psychological insight. Until the massacre the film is extraordinary good, after that I had a bit of a problem with the extreme black/white characterization of Elias and Barnes.",

441,21 October 2014,lois-lane33,5, A good war movie that perhaps misses something important.,"The Vietnam War. From March 1965 to April 1975. Technically. They signed a Peace Treaty in January 1973 but the fighting continued until August 1973. The last US troops left in 1975. This film, Platoon, is a slice of the Vietnam War. Through the eyes of one film producer. In a way I think that Hollywood has never really talked much about the 'whats and the wherefores' of that particular war, in any of its films-even in the iconic 1979 film Apocalypse Now. Which is the best of the bunch of Vietnam War movies. In Platoon you get a fairly predictable depiction of soldiers who would rather be partying, struggling through hip deep swamps and cutting their way through dense packed jungle-hunted at all times and none too happy about it. None of the films about Vietnam mentions the ongoing US space program that just happened to happen at the exact same time as the Vietnam War. I wouldn't be impressed with the space program if I was lying down in mud, in the rain, in clothes that haven't been washed for a month, in order to avoid getting my head blown off by a bunch of people I'd never laid eyes on before, in a country I never had any interest in. I think the feelings of patriotism that followed the initial US decision to enter into a ground war in Vietnam in 1965 faded rapidly when the bodies stated coming home. By the thousands. This movie is a slice of life during the Vietnam War but its conspicuous avoidance of mentioning the ongoing US space program-which would have been on peoples minds-is 'selective memory' on the part of the scriptwriting. It wasn't ""that bad""-it was 'very much worse', in my humble opinion. Few haven't seen this film by now.",

I do believe that this movie gives a fair shot of how it might've been being an American trooper down there in those flood deltas, and the way Oliver delivers this story to the viewer it's simply amazing and stunning.

The film is powerful and gripping. It is also quite gory, which is a turn-off to some people. But, after all, there is a lot of gore in war, right? Tom Berenger's portrayal of Sgt.

452,13 September 2012,gmouat,9, One of the best....,"One of the best Oliver Stone's 1986 Vietnam era war film Platoon is one of the most authentic and probing films about the Vietnam War ever made. Not only does it show the dedication and courage of the soldiers who fought in the conflict is also shows the underbelly of the conflict as well. The film, which is also written by Stone, stars Charlie Sheen, Forest Whitaker, Willem Dafoe, and Tom Berenger and in one of his first film roles Jonny Depp. The film tells the story of a newly arrived in country volunteer private named Chris played very professionally by Charlie Sheen. In the movie Chris goes from replacement ""new guy"" to veteran soldier in the course of his tour and learns from those around him how to cope with his new surroundings. Along the way he learns how to survive not only the enemy but also the environment and even those on his own side. He also learns to become a man from 2 polar opposites and as he puts it 2 separate fathers. They are Staff Sergeant Barns played by Tom Berenger and Staff Sergeant Elias played by Wilem Dafoe. Both of these characters play a big part in the development of Chris and how he views the war and life in general. Staff Sergeant Barns is more of the no-nonsense hard charging win at any cost influence while Staff Sergeant Elias is the more sage-like and introspective influence who takes a wider view of things. Throughout the film Chris evolves and scared and somewhat excited volunteer to savvy and jaded veteran. The films main theme is one of good vs. evil. This can be seen in many of the scenes and in the contrast between Dafoe and Berengers characters. The motif fits in well with the theme because Chris constantly has to choose between what he sees at right and wrong. This is especially true in the scenes concerning the Vietnamese village. Music and soundtrack are great in this movie. The songs, both original and not original fit in perfectly with the time period and move seamlessly throughout the film and set the mood perfectly. The battle scenes in this film were, for the time, some of the best ever shot until Saving Private Ryan came along and they set the standard for all that followed. This movie will go down as one of the classics of not only war films but of all films in general regardless of genre. This is truly an American classic.",

458,27 March 2005,XxPlatoonxX,10, stunning,"With a buttload of war movies out for us movie goers to see, there is rarely any of them that stick out and grab your attention. Sure Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now, and Platoon are by far the war movies that are in the highest regards to us critics, many only have one war movie that we judge others by. And for me that movie is Platoon. The setting that stone brings us in when the movie starts mixed with sheens surprising performance narrating the story sets the mood for which is to come. One of the upsides to this movie is that it really doesn't concentrate that much on battle scenes as much as blockbusters nowadays do. The real sense is that of the troops inner struggle instead of the struggle between us and the vietcong. Berenger and Dafoe give extremely good performances and i would like to say that Berenger gave one of the best performances ever in the history of film. I would also like to say that no matter how many crappy movies sheen is in Platoon will always make him a star. This film is an absolute masterpiece from beginning to end. Then again i can see why others might not like it, what with the lack of high paid bombings, and shoot outs and whatnot that people might like from a war movie. However I'm gonna stick to what i think of the movie and say it is a masterpiece and i think is a must see for anyone that is into movies.",
459,23 June 2019,BadChristian,8, Realistic war movie with unrealistic warfare,"Platoon is a distressing, dark, and disturbing film, but far too often it pulls its punches. Right out of the gate, Platoon sees our main character, portrayed by Charlie Sheen, starting his tour in the Vietnam War. What follows tries to be a serious, realistic vision of the war and its effects on our soldiers. For the most part, it succeeds. The story itself is the standard Vietnam story with some added dramatic elements and about half of the acting is pretty great (there are a lot of future stars here that I wasn't expecting to see). The other half of the cast ranges from below average to awful, but I'm not expecting an A+ cast in a war movie. My main issue is that even though they do express the atrocities of the Vietnam war and almost all of the characters felt real and I cared about what happened to them (whether I was invested in their survival or praying for their demise) even without contextualizing anything, Oliver Stone really dialed back the realism on the violence. Rarely do gunshots feel real, either the actual shot from the gun or the impact, and the blood effects are pretty terrible. I can understand toning it down if the level of violence was also toned down, but aside from a few events that we hear, but the camera cuts away so that we don't see, Platoon still has a lot of violence and death. No one ever acts like they were hit by a bullet, they just all of a sudden collapse and are covered in blood, there is no reaction to the impact and quite a few of the actors seem to think that a bullet wound causes generalized pain and not location specific. We see a head shot, but beyond a little skyward squirt, the only blood we see is a smear across where the bullet wound should be. I'm not asking for Quentin Tarantino or Eli Roth levels of blood and gore, but if realism is the goal, it should be applied equally, especially if your movie is essentially meant to be anti-war propaganda, you would assume that he'd want to paint a full picture. The story is generic and the effects are bad, but it has heart and there is a level of enjoyment to be had just seeing all these familiar faces showing up looking a lot younger than we're used to (I'd recommend not looking at any cast listings, because finally hitting the credits and saying ""I though that was him!"" is a blast). One thing that I'm not quite sure about is whether the Vietnamese and Philippine actors were just really bad actors (a good number of them are Vietnamese refugees that just happened to be living the the Philippines when they were shooting) or if it's a cultural thing. There is one woman who has a very convincing performance, but most of them are just blank mannequins that don't convey any emotion and sometimes smile when watching their neighbors die. If it was just the VC, it wouldn't even be noticeable, but when we see individual actors for any prolonged amount of time, it becomes clear that they aren't ""real"" actors and are just trying their best. Platoon is a solid Vietnam War movie that hits all the emotional notes it tries to, but is missing any real artistic style. Basically, I wanted something more like Full Metal Jacket; unflinching and real, but with cinematography that felt like it belongs to a director's vision.",
460,23 February 2017,pcoughlin-94063,9, great film,Platoon directed and written by Oliver Stone is a masterpiece. From start to end it is intriguing. There is no down parts in the movie and full of action. It makes it seem as if you are part of the Vietnam war while watching the movie. Very realistic account.

It also illustrates with devastating realism the attitude many American GI's were forced (or chose) to adopt: that ANYONE could be the enemy, even seemingly innocent, benign villagers.

Insanity of war is best pictured in Apocalypse Now, FMJ adds a lot with the soldier training, and Platoon really brings you into the battle like no other.

464,21 June 2022,Alex_Lo,8, Processing Vietnam,"Robert Richardson's brilliant camerawork is more documentary than narrative, making the jungle war incredibly compelling. But the film also wants to be political. ""We're fighting each other when we should be fighting them."" shows the big weak point of the film. Even though the atrocities committed by the Americans are not glossed over, the Vietnamese who actually suffer remain a marginal presence. This fact and the simultaneous commercial success of the film in the States show that in the mid-1980s there was still no reflection on the American mission in Vietnam. But the film is an important step in coming to terms with the subject.",
465,15 January 2002,hill-1,6, Partly real/partly political,"The acting by Dafoe and Beringer was top notch. However, while this movie fairly accurately portrayed the day-to-day miserable conditions under which an infantryman fought in Vietnam (or any war), most of the plot is largely symbolic:  ""good seargent"" (Elias) versus ""evil seargent""(Barnes) who are ""fighting for the soul"" of FNG Chris Taylor (Sheen).  The depiction of the squad on night ambush, trying to stay awake in the rain after humping the bush all day--truly a realistically miserable portrayal.  But Sheen's later savvy, getting out of the bunker just before an RPG hits it, was uncharacteristic of his character.  His spectacular one-man charge at the NVA in the middle of the firefight would have realistically gotten him killed.  Sheen's background narration often verged on the corny and derisive, such as in describing the rest of the platoon: ""They were society's losers, Grandma--the bottom of the barrel"" (or words to that effect), and does a disservice to Vietnam infantrymen.  It also repeats the old stereotype that only young draftees fought the war and died there (not true!).  The village ""massacre scene"" was just Stone's grinding his own political axe.  Such events were truly rare or we would have much more documentation on them. Read the book ""Platoon: Bravo Company"", by Robert Hemphill, the real commander of the unit portrayed in Platoon.  A somewhat different perspective than that portrayed by Stone.  I speak from experience, as an infantry veteran of the Vietnam War.",
466,17 January 2007,daniel-ambia,6, A classic film?,"Willem Dafoe is outstanding in this film as he usually is in most of the work he has done. Forrest Whittaker, Kevin Dillon and Johnny Depp are enjoyable to watch as well simply because they are so darn young. I have read about the war in Vietnam extensively and according to friends of mine who served in that war Platoon gives the best depiction of the environment, uniforms, customs etc... of the time. Unfortunately, although Stone had a lot of the right ingredients to make a war film classic including funding and personal experience, he fell short in my opinion due to the final scenes of the film. As he so often does, Oliver Stone touched on a serious issue but did not have the guts to delve into it as he did in Born on the Fourth of July. The scenes reminiscent to the public of the My Lai massacre are sugar coated. Sheens character somehow turns from being a sniveling preppie private into a VC killing Captain America by the end of the movie. While I'm sure there have been cases of extreme heroism such as that,I felt the way the character metamorphed into a larger then life hollywoodesque Rambo was extremely unbelievable. It took away from the momentum of the film. It probably would have been better to kill off Sheen because in reality that is what would have happened. Anyway, I respect Stone for his politics and for well, some of his films anyway Alexander and Any Given Sunday excluded, but if only he had stuck to his guts and made a war movie with a little more realism then Platoon would most certainly be a great war film classic.",
467,24 June 2005,Tom16uk,8," This is a ""real"" film, and its excellent","I don't think I've ever watched a film that depicts a real life situation as good as this. It is a rare film in that it is complete - the acting, music, setting and directing are all superb and create an amazingly realistic atmosphere. From watching this film, you will not only be entertained, but you will learn what life was like during the Vietnam War. In case you haven't already heard, Platoon is a war film that presents us with a day-by-day account of young Charlie Sheen, who is struggling to fit in with a group of soldiers, all much older than him. As you should know, the Vietnam war lasted many years and soon became a problem for the American society when the media found out the truth, and as Walter Kronkite, the news reader said ""What the hells going on? I thought we were winning this war!"" (Nope, my gcse in history ain't coming out) But this film concentrates on how the soldiers were feeling, and reacting to the war. Oliver Stone who directed this film put the actors through their paces by actually making them survive in real soldier conditions, were they had to dig there own homes, avoid sleeping on watch duty, and much more. It proved a treat as all the acting in this looks as though the war had started again. Normally at this point, I would comment on the films special effects, but I've got a break because this film just uses very realistic warfare weapons to create the big war scenes. You would think this would make it a preety low budget movie, but when you see the attention to detail, it must have a long film to shoot. This is a great film, but not for the faint hearted. As you would expect from a realistic film, there is lots of blood and 'gorey wound' scenes. And again there's a lot of shooting, the saddest part being when the platoon of troops shoot down a group of innocent villagers due to frustration. Overall, this is a great film. Good acting and great surroundings combine with a theme tune that will never escape your head its that sad and catchy, just like the film.",

469,18 December 2002,mtiller12,9, In my opinion the best Nam movie,"Platoon is a very good film and inside the top five of that decade. The film is about new recruit Chris Taylor(Charlie Sheen)who comes to Vietnam and witneses the harsh realities of war. Sheen excells in the role of Chris Taylor,trying to keep his innocence in a place with no innocence.He is also helped by the fact he has a  strong supporting cast in Willem Dafoe as Sgt.Elias and Tom Berenger as Sgt.Barnes,both of whom got oscar nominated. This movie has a boost by the fact that the director was a soldier in the vietnam war,Oliver Stone used his knowledge of the war to pen a great script and then direct a great movie. Many believe that Apocalypse Now is the best Nam movie but Platoon`s emotional message gets across much easier and it is not as weird as Apocalypse Now,Platoon isn`t like that and Nam may not have been like that,remember Stone was there he knows what happened. The combat scenes are incredibly realistic and the movie has touching scenes.

The Deer Hunter is still a masterpiece (as are the others, except for maybe Hamburger Hill), but I think that since Platoon is leaner, it has a slight advantage.

480,7 June 2020,dillylamar,9, Platoon,"Platoon is a 1986 Vietnam war film written and directed by Oliver Stone. It depicts the breakdown and transformation of a man, into becoming a part of the war machine. While also depicting the horror of the war, and the soldiers fight with morality, duality, self worth, and leadership. This film is directed very well. With Stone, whi was in Vietnam hinself, making the narrative of this film similar to his experience, he created epic and brutal war sequences, and constructed scenes that are crucial in the soldiers transformation. The film is written well, with dialogue and narrations of the main character fighting between two leaders, struggling to understand his meaning in life, and discussing how most of the soldiers come from bad places, and that they are considered expendable by the government. Charlie Sheen does a pretty job in his role, while Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe excel in theirs. The themes of this film are the horror of war, the breakdown of a man into becoming part of the machine, and the duality of men. For example, the duality of Chris is shown through Elias and Barnes. In the beginning of the film his weak side, a soldier whom I dont know the name, is killed. Integrated him to war. He fights in almost the entire film between Elias and Barnes. As he acts like both of them in several scenes. When Elias dies, he loses that morality, and eventually by the end of the film, becomes Barnes when he kills Barnes. This film does a great job of foreshadowing and showing the transformation of this certain person and topic. Platoon is not the best war film of all time, but a horrifying, epic, layered, and thought provoking one, that packs an incredible realistic punch. Holding up in current times. The film does a fantastic job of making war look horrifying, brutal, torturing, making the characters look desperate, tired, worn out and unstable.",

As both the director and the writer for this masterpiece, he has successfully and accurately depicted the horrors of the Vietnam War taken out straight from his memory lanes when he volunteered to joined to fight for his country.

482,30 April 2018,berndjp,9, Transformations,"This movie might leave the viewer unsatisfied. No heroes, no happy end, no winning, even the humorous scenes are disturbing. Instead, this movie shows the main character's, a man of privilege, education and conscience, transformation by war and military service. War, an extraordinary circumstance, can bring out the best or worst in men, transform them according to their disposition and also change the warring nations en suite. All this and more is incorporated here, underlined by a marvelous score, convincingly acted in almost every role, scarring to watch, thought provoking and honest. On the downside, there are some minor continuity errors, lack in realism and typical Oliver Stone-esque transcendental scenes, though non of these infringe on any of the premises of this film unless you are a stickler for every last detail. This is deservedly amongst the best films about the U.S. Vietnam war ever made.",
483,6 November 2005,yellowslug,10, real,"I was traveling in Vietnam in 2002. Amazing place, amazing people. I was in the US in 96 and 82. Amazing place, amazing people. To send American troops to fight in Asia was amazing! I had watched the movie before I visited Vietnam, but watching it after I had spent time in Saigon...my whole perception changed.In Vietnam , the war is called the American War..I was always used to the name, "" the Vietnam War""...now I know why the people who live there call it the American War...Foreignors from a distant land come to fight for a cause that the Natives don't even understand!!!??? what the hell was going on? Oliver Stone has recreated the truth, the mood, the reality. ....not only of war, but of how humanity is so fickle!!!! watch this movie..and absorb it.",
484,15 July 2002,Barry_the_Baptist,6, second half saves the film from mediocrity. (Minor Spoilers),"The first hour of ""Platoon"" is so poorly written I thought this was going to destroy the entire picture. It is the most basic humanist story imaginable that a little snot like myself who has never fought in war could have predicted that the message of the film would be ""War is hell"" yadda yadda yadda Charlie Sheen is so unconvincing. I like how Stone chose to show his growth as a person and a soldier in the span of five minutes:",
485,20 March 2006,negropaiper,9, excellent,"ohh man! i bought this film on DVD just because i've just seen Alexander (directors cut) and I though it was great...so I thought to my self, this oliver stone guy is really great, i gotta see more of his films...so I bought Platoon...I knew Stone fought in Vietnam and was wounded twice, him being in Vietnam gives the film a very realistic feeling...and though I've read some reviews sating that it is stupid to assume that America lost the war because they where not fighting the gooks but they where fighting themselves...it must not be the reason, but that is what stone saw in the war, it might not have happened in all of the platoons but it did happen in some way or another...I read somewhere that the scene where they are smoking Mary jane doesn't look real...well my friends the truth is that for that scene the cast really smoked weed...in fact oliver stone smokes weed...I thats why his filmaking is so great...it is like pink floyd...without drugs there wouldn't be a pink floyd...without weed there's no oliver stone...I think. great movie anti-war movie...just hope it doesn't happen again...although Iraq is becoming the new Vietnam. think about it.",
486,31 May 2022,damodara_and_radha,10, A masterpiece,"The Vietnam war - in all its gory details. It's so well written by Oliver Stone. And incredible acting - Charlie Sheen before he wrecked his life, Willem Dafoe and others. The ""My Lai"" scene is truly gut wrenching.",
