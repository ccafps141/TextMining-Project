0,27 February 2020,tkarlmann,10, I have NEVER seen such a performance ... ever!,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz! He has won just about every award for his performance in this film, and he deserves every single one of them.
Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo!
He is ULTRA polite with each one; and has supreme confidence in his scary, chilling, bold mannerisms.
All I can say is: ""You see this movie for Christoph Waltz's performance; all the rest is secondary""!",/
1,30 May 2014,SnoopyStyle,8, Quentin Tarantino's style and Christoph Waltz's menace,"In 1941 Nazi-occupied France, ""The Jew Hunter"" SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) finds the Dreyfus family hidden by their neighbors. Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) escapes after her family is massacred. Meanwhile Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) has gathered 8 Jewish American soldiers to kill Nazis behind enemy lines. Their brutal scalping campaign instills fear among the Germans. Donowitz (Eli Roth) is even given a nickname ""The Bear Jew"" for brutally beating Nazis with a baseball bat. Then in June 1944, Shosanna has a new name and a theater. She catches the eye of German war hero Fredrick Zoller who wants a big premiere in her theater that will attract the biggest of Nazi leaders. It even attracts the Jew Hunter as well as the Inglourious Basterds.",r
2,5 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, Tarantino's best? I think so,"No joke – I believe this film to be Tarantino's best yet. The movie has its naysayers, but I see this as the epitome of movie-making: a literate, intelligent film, beautifully shot from an excellent and original script. You might be forgiven for thinking that little more needs to be said about the Second World War, but you'd be wrong, as this outing shows: it's as fresh as a field full of daffodils in the springtime. I knew I was in for some fun with the opening sequence, in which spaghetti western style music riffs on an old classical piece and builds up the tension as Nazi officer arrives to question a remote French farmer.",e
3,7 February 2020,laurabethc1,10, I can't believe I just now watched this for the first time.,"This is a perfect Tarantino movie. It's explosive and exciting while also deep and well thought out. It took me a minute to get used to reading so many subtitles because of the variety of languages used, but I think that's a quality that makes the movie even more enticing. It is incredibly well done and it had a hold of me from beginning to end. Fair warning for any Tarantino movie, be prepared for the gore and violence. It runs rampant throughout the movie, but it's kind of gratifying seeing it happen to the Nazis.",v

5,20 November 2022,Xstal,9, Oh! What a Lovely War...,"There's a hunter called Hans Landa you should fear, if circumcision defines the way your men appear, on the surface quite polite, underneath riven with spite, carries a scar that lets you know of his career (or at least he will). But those un-helmeted can rejoice and be spurred, avenging evil come Inglorious Basterds, being led by Aldo Raine, with a remit to cause pain, several parts may disappear as things are sheared.",e

7,12 December 2021,ruelshepperd,9, Glorious indeed!,"Aside from the Kill Bill's I have not seen any other Tarantino film. I heard this one was good and so I watched. It's great. From the opening scene you are mesmerized by Christoph Waltz's unnerving performance. He gets a lot of credit and rightfully so. Hans Lands is possibly one of the greatest movie villains of all time. There so many iconic moments and Tarantino demonstrates how normal dialogue scenes can become suddenly intense with words alone. Every actor gives it their all with Brad Pitt giving a memorable performance as well. This movie is worth watching just for its opening but it also has back to back quality scenes that are well shot and have excellent dialogue. The movie balances it's comedy with excellent dark moments reminding viewers that this is indeed a WW2 film. Overall, my favourite Tarantino film of the three I've seen and might be for some time. Worth watching for Christoph Waltz.",/
8,8 September 2009,bkoganbing,8, World War II In an Alternate Universe,"I take exception to the comment that one reviewer made saying that a film like Inglourious Basterds had not been made before. Not only was one made, but it was made during World War II. When Hitler, Dead Or Alive was shown I'm sure the same rousing cheers went up from the audience who really wanted World War II to end that way.",r
9,23 July 2009,motta80-2,8," Great fun, a real surprise","It just goes to show how wrong you can be. I had not expected to like this film. I was disappointed by both the Kill Bill films (although i preferred the second) and Death Proof (although it was better in the shorter cut of the double-bill release). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction and think that Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature piece of film-making - technically his most superior - including the last great performance elicited from Robert De Niro. Since then it seems to me while his films have been okay (i haven't hated them) he has been treading water in referential, reverential, self-indulgent juvenilia.",w
10,17 January 2010,planktonrules,8," Not for everyone...but if you like this sort of thing, watch it--it is a lot of fun.","This must be said first and foremost--if you HATE violent films, then don't watch this film. The film is filled with ultra-violent images that will turn your stomach--scalpings, machine gunnings, fire bombs roasting crowds of people and the like. My assumption, and I am NOT trying to be sexist, is that in general guys will like it more than women--though I know that there are man exceptions. If you look at the demographic breakdown on IMDb of votes, this doesn't reveal any difference between men and women...unless you look carefully. You'll see that men have outvoted women 10-1! It is, simply put, a ""guy film"".",2
11,14 August 2010,rmax304823,3, Schlock and Awe.,It's one of those movies that's difficult to evaluate because it's as inconsistent as it is. The plot is ludicrous yet there are very suspenseful moments embedded in it. Nobody could have made this except Quentin Tarantino -- it's that original -- and yet it rips off bits of business and entire subplots from a dozen or more other sources.,9

13,16 February 2014,Theo Robertson,4, Hitler's Table Talk,One good thing about waiting several years after a very well received film is released is that you can step back from it and judge it on its content without all the hype . Sometimes if you go against the grain you do feel you're in danger of being branded a blasphemous heretic who should be locked up in order to keep little children safe at night or worse still to protect film makers from unpopular views . To be honest I have real excuse for missing Tarantino's INGLOURIOUS except that it never popped up in front of my radar until now . After finally getting round to seeing the movie I can put my hand on my heart and say I didn't miss all that much ,1
14,23 August 2009,zardoz-13,1, A revisionist Holocaust fantasy of far-fetched proportions!,"""Pulp Fiction"" director Quentin Tarantino has taken Italian filmmaker Enzo G. Castellari's cult World War II thriller ""Inglorious Bastards"" (1978) and reimagined it as a cinematic atrocity entitled ""Inglourious Basterds."" Castellari's riveting mission-behind-enemy-lines thriller about a group of court-martialed Allied deserters led by Bo Svenson and Fred Williamson qualified as an electrifying actioneer with charismatic characters boasting several surprises. ",2
15,3 October 2009,abelardo64,9, A Comedy Of Horrors,"Brad Pitt sticks his index finger in Diane Kruger's leg wound and keeps it there until he gets what he wants. Funny, horribly so. The invented yarn takes ""The Dirty Dozen"" for a ride and sometimes abandons it to pay tribute to other movies. Lots of fun. Even ""Paris when it sizzles"" is mentioned in a delightfully organic piece of dialog. I was thrilled by Christoph Waltzer's character and by his sensational performance. Brad Pitt creates a true original. I love the actor's lack of vanity. There's a quirk in the character that is pure Brad Pitt. Tarantino visits a new universe but. fortunately, his hand. his brain and his heart are visible all over the place.",5
16,11 March 2011,ElMaruecan82,4, A dangerous and irresponsible film from a director who used to be great...,"Reviewing ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a moral dilemma. I know it has everything to please the fans, it's entertaining, masterfully directed and edited, and features memorable characters portrayed by a big-star cast, and the whole film is carried by one of the greatest supporting and villainous performance of the last ten years. Christoph Waltz, as Hans Landa, is an unforgettable character, magnetic even in one blink or a crazy smirk. But this is a supporting performance, not enough to redeem the film.",6
17,27 March 2010,Bolesroor,1, Fiasco,"""Inglorious Basterds"" is a movie so clueless, so sloppy, so jam-packed full of half-ass characters and shock-value violence, so relentlessly terrible that I can't even muster the rage and indignation that most intelligent film fans feel toward Quentin Tarantino.",/
18,15 July 2014,Hitchcoc,8," Hey, It's Tarantino!","I've read so many of the naysayers. Giving this a one rating seems really spiteful. They speak of Walz's excellence in his role. If there is an actor of such incredible skill, how can one give it one star. Yes this is violent. Yes it is gratuitous. Yes it stretches the bound of reality. But Tarantino pushes the envelope at every turn in every movie. My God, what about ""Django Unchained."" There will always be flying body parts and characters of almost supernatural proportions. The plot that leads to the face-off in the movie theater is very intricate and does stretch our believability meter, but it is really engaging. Yes, the Germans are interesting in their own ways. Remember, this is not a propaganda film. We are put into a setting that is not for one instance a real portrayal of an historical event. But it does draw out the evils of war and makes a serious statement. It does have heroes and heroines. I know at times I was left a bit confused as to the point, but it didn't diminish my enjoyment of the movie itself.",?
19,19 March 2022,robinhio84_,9," I'm not a war film fan at all, but this is fantastic","From the moment this movie starts the score already gives an epic feeling. The first scene is so strong and somehow this level is maintained throughout the movie. Tarantino absolutely excels with this film. The story is great, but almost 2nd to the performance. Most actors are great, however it's Christoph Waltz that takes his role to the next level..",r
20,8 October 2021,skrstenansky,7, Pretty good,"This movie is a bit overrated and really isn't the best of Tarantino, but its still a good film. Very great acting and cast of characters, amazing cinematogaphy. A entertaining but stupid and unrealistic story of WW2. Good effects and just very well done, good film but overated.",e
21,30 July 2009,Llakor,9, Dark but Funny Comic Fantasy,"Inglorious Basterds is a dark and violent comic fantasy, gloriously so. Built on the framework of The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds ditches the elongated training sequences of The Dirty Dozen to plunge into the action right away. In the process, Tarantino fixes one of The Dirty Dozen's major flaws by giving the bad guys screen time to remind us just how bad the Nazis were. The Nazis with the most screen time end up becoming the most completely human characters in the film, which ironically makes them even worse monsters.",f
22,27 July 2010,DarthBill,1," ""I don't suppose you'll mind if I go out speaking the King's.""","PLOT (or lack thereof): A group of Jewish American soldiers, led by Brad Pitt, go overseas to during World War 2 to terrorize and massacre Nazis while a Jewish cinema owner, the only survivor of her family, having barely escaped a German soldier known as ""The Jew Hunter"" played Christopher Waltz, who now plots to have her revenge when a film about a German sharp shooter is forced upon her to debut at her theater, while Waltz plans defection.",_
23,21 January 2010,HalGuentert,1, This Movie Was A Bad Joke About WWII,"For those that have studied WWII, and unfortunately, seen real human brains on the ground, this movie is a travesty, a sadistic farce, and a complete waste of time like most of Tarantino's other questionable work. I do admit to liking ""Reservoir Dogs"" to a point. However, this thing does not even have an original title.",=
24,4 October 2009,claudiaeilcinema,6, Tarantino and His Italian Critics,"You should hear the Italian critics talking about Tarantino and ""Inglorious Bastards"". They run out of superlatives. One of them last night actually shouted ""Tarantino is my God"". Wow! I, personally, suspect that Tarantino is the result of a generation of TV and bad (now cult) exploitation movies. I enjoy him, don't get me wrong, but I'm not shouting miracle when I still have ""The Great Escape"", for instance, so fresh in my mind. ""Inglorious Basterds"" more than any of the other Tarantino films is all about appearances. There is nothing underneath other than references to other movies. Nothing wrong with that in fact I like it but I refuse to treat Quentin Tarantino as a sort of Deity. I can't buy it. I think he should be placed exactly where he belongs among the best of his kind but what kind is that? Never mind, it works. Italian critics who are so prepared to destroy their own - you should read some of the reviews for ""Baaria"" - are prepared to fall to their knees in front of Tarantino. This are the same critics that last year, the year of ""Milk"", ""Slumdog Millionaire"" ""Edge Of Heaven"", The Wrestler"" etc, gave the David de Donatello Award for best picture to ""Grand Torino"" I want to make sure that I'm making my point clearly. ""Inglorious Bastards"" is a terrific comedy with most of Tarantino's trademark tricks in place. You'll have a great time with Brad Pitt and an incredible Christoph Waltz as the ultimate Nazi villain but don't expect a masterpiece as declared by some critics. That kind of review damages the film and me the spectator. It forces something on me. As if I was suppose to feel the same otherwise there is something wrong with me. No. I liked it, I recommend it for what it is. Period.",t
25,27 September 2009,kosmasp,9, Waltz with Pitt,"C. Waltz is the new discovery in this movie. He might have had a following in German speaking countries, but with this movie, he's getting world famous. Speaking 4 languages (and that's only in this movie, who knows how many more he is able to master) and being the main actor in this, despite the title of the movie. Which leads us to one thing that might be appalling to some people (especially to those who love(d) the original ""Inglorious Bastards"").",t
26,11 September 2009,CineCritic2517,1, A failure to fuse different movie genres into one feature.,Tarantino was in my opinion a master in fusing different movie genres into one. But he miserably and painfully fails to do so in Inglourious Bastards (IB). ,_
27,7 October 2009,uhmartinez-phd,8, A Rip Roaring Yarn,"An fun, engrossing, beautifully crafted piece of nonsense, the likes of which we hadn't seen in a long long time. The silliness of the story is marvelously camouflaged with great dialogue and some superb performances. Christoph Waltz must be thinking already about his acceptance speech. What a performance! The civilized monster, polyglot, refined and deadly. He gets us going from the first, sensational scene. Brad Pitt is also wonderful. Was he putting a Mussolinni chin while impersonating (hilariously) an Italian? I thought so. His character's name sounds like Aldo Ray and I'm sure that's no accident. The film is full of movie references. Another character is named Fenek, as an homage to his 1970's sexpot, Edwige Fenech. What is already one of Tarantino's trademarks is his sure step along the most immediately recognizable bits of pop culture. He's clearly not a cultured man but a pop expert, king in a world where people get their news from TV, don't read, other than magazines and comics, etc. That's how it happens, to be in the right place at the right time. For better or worse this are Tarantino times.",u

And yes, there are parts of this overly-lengthy film that are terrific, but I've just come to the point where the thrill is gone. Gone is my appetite for Tarantino's style with excessive homages to an era of films I never saw, and neither did many of his hard-core fans. Gone (if it ever was truly there) is my desire for endless conversations that seldom lead anywhere or advance what little plot his films often have. It's all pretty much gone. Tarantino has been doing this to us for almost twenty years now, and its time that either himself or myself moves on.",v

32,22 May 2014,BA_Harrison,9," Bold, brutal and brilliant.","Even though the title is virtually identical to Enzo G. Castellari's 1978 Italian warsploitation 'classic' The Inglourious Bastards, Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is most definitely NOT a remake. Far from it. Not only is it one of Tarantino's more original efforts to date, but it also one of his best films for a long time, a riveting tale of derring-do that features plenty of everything that made his first two movies such a success: great dialogue, wonderful performances (Christoph Waltz is brilliant, as is an almost unrecognisable Mike Myers), excellent pacing, impressive direction, explosive violence, fantastic use of music, and more than a few playful visual touches of the kind that only Quentin seems to be able to get away with.",
33,20 September 2009,Sandcooler,10, Brilliantly offbeat wartime western,"Wow. It's been a while since I left a movie theatre so overwhelmed. From the first minute to the last this movie is shocking, amusing and horrendously entertaining all at the same time. The prologue is vintage Tarantino. The way the tension is build up throughout that opening scene is truly magnificent, and the camera pans down just at the right time. And by that time you've already learned to absolutely despise Landa, probably the most disgusting character Tarantino ever came up with. He's truly a man you love to hate, and his charming persona just makes him seem even more evil. He's if possible even more threatening than Jules Winfield was in the infamous breakfast scene from ""Pulp Fiction"". The segments with the basterds are probably the ones Tarantino had the most fun with, and these segments really know no boundaries in any way. Not only are they hilariously violent (the baseball bat!), they also ignore every possible historic fact. I wouldn't really want it any other way really. Another highlight is the bar scene, which illustrates perfectly how unpredictable this movie is. There are too many good moments to be naming them all, but this movie benefits so much from its outrageousness you really need to see everything for yourself.",
34,5 October 2009,terrygiu2000,7, The Jewish Scalphunters of Quentin Tarantino,"Once again, revenge is at the center of a Quentin Tarantino movie. This time a Jewish dirty dozen takes things on their own hands. Tarantino re-writes history and shortens WWII with a comic stroke that is as entertaining as it is vacuous. A fantasy that re-arranges some controversial historical points. Okay, it's a movie and as such it works for most of its two and a half hours. Christoph Waltz opens things up in the most promising way. The opening sequence is filled with a subtle but unbearable tension. Weltz amalgamates all the Nazi villains we have loved and hated in the movies into one glorious creation. (I will advise my countrymen to see it in its original multi-language version - the Italian version is another movie altogether. Some of the extra pleasures are in the dialog that, naturally, are not to be found in the Italian version) Brad Pitt, rapidly becoming one of the best character actors in the world, with a leading man's face and billing, is truly fantastic. Diane Kruger makes a credible Barbara Bouchet (one of Tarantino's muses from trash action Italian movies from the 70's) and the rest of the cast has some exquisite touches like Rod Taylor as Winston Churchill. Highly recommended for a Sunday afternoon.",

I believe this is one of Tarantino's greatest works from the 21st century. This film has everything, it has comedy, an excellent soundtrack and a ingenious plot set over five chapters. All I can say is that this film is just fun.",
37,4 August 2010,basilisksamuk,5, Frustrating Experience,Utterly frustrating viewing experience. There is an excellent film in here but it's ruined by the way in which Tarantino breaks the contract with the viewer. There is absolutely no need to vandalise the viewing experience by insulting the intelligence of the viewer and by scribbling (literally) over the images on screen in a way that further implies the viewer is an idiot who could not follow a simple story without the guidance from an unseen hand.,

I haven't seen ""Death Proof"" but I think I've seen all the other ones he's directed and this is definitely the worst. In fact his films have been getting worse all the time and the last respectable thing he did was ""Jackie Brown"" as far as I'm concerned. I'm pretty much through with him. His credit is totally gone with me. As far as I can tell he makes movies to feed the fantasies of 14 year old boys. It seems like his early movies were fun and different, even if they used a lot of stuff from older movies they put it together in a different way.

42,25 August 2009,Pumpkin_Man,5, Very Boring!!!,"I tried hard to like this, but in the end, this movie was just as bad and boring as Tarantino's crap-fest, Death Proof! There were a few funny parts and a couple of action scenes, but the rest was just dull conversations in another language. You practically read the whole movie. There was 95% talking, and 5% action! The film is told in 5 chapters, and the only two chapters I kinda liked were Chapter Two & Five. Brad Pitt plays Lieutenant Aldo Raine who is the leader of a group called The Basterds. They kill Nazis, and plan to kill all the Nazis and Adolf Hitler at a theatre during a Nazi fest. A few weeks ago, I rented the original Inglorious Bastards movie to get ready for this one, but that was a waste of time, because this has nothing to do with the 1970's version.

44,3 October 2009,borromeot,6, A Brilliant Filmmaker With Very Little To Say,"Very entertaining, that's for sure. Great little moments ""inspired"" by other movies. ""The Guns Of Navarone"", ""Operation Crossbow"" and a myriad of 70's B exploitation Italian movies. Tarantino is certainly clever and knows how to use the camera but then, I have to say it, nothing. The childish ""divertimento"" dressed in smart ass dialog remains there. The entertainment value is, perhaps, the most one should expect from a movie but it seems a damn shame that such a talent should be put at the service of something so one dimensional. I can't help but remember Ernst Lubitch's ""To Be Or Not To Be"" that was also a comedy with remarkable, inventive dialog but it also had so many other layers that ""To Be Or Not To Be"" after 70 years still resonates with whoever has seen it. Christoph Waltz is terrific and Brad Pitt is always great fun to watch but the experience is purely epidermic in spite of some truly gruesome moments. Am I expecting oranges from an apple tree? If that's so forget what I've just said and run to meet Tarantino's basterds.",

It is an insult to the veterans of WWII, and an insult to the intelligence of film goers. The trailer for the film is a piece of misleading garbage that has little to do with the film, and the group portrayed in the trailer should have been called ""The Inglourious Idiots"". Added to all the above is the fact that too many Hollywood drug addicts think that having most of the film in a foreign language makes it a better film. That just proves that much of the Hollywood crowd is a bunch of snobbish, self-important, elitist, and truly uncreative a**es that do not know how to make a good film.

A farmer hiding Jews in the basement, being ""interrogated"" friendly by a Nazi, while the guards wait outside, they come in later and shoot them all and let one escape. That is a bad start. It is stupid. The stupidity does not end. This was not a funny movie, this was not satire, this was not entertainment, this was a long long list of stupid scenes, one unbelievable plot hole after another.

49,21 August 2009,Captain_Couth,5, A mediocre effort from Tarantino. Nothing but a pastiche of films and silly sitcom dialog,"I saw Inglourious Basterds at a midnight screening and I was unimpressed with the movie. Seems like Tarantino has run out of ideas and sharp dialog. He promised a war movie in the style of an Italian western. All I saw was a pastiche of Italian westerns, bad humor and long drawn out dialog that lacked any of his previous films unique wit. Being a fan of pop culture Tarantino peppers the script with a lot of it from the 30's and 40's (yes it seems really forced). If you have seen a lot of Italian westerns, then you'll know what you're in for. Long panning camera shots, close ups of eyes and even longer wide shots. The actions scenes are few and scattered throughout the film. What I really didn't like about the film itself was that it's too helter skelter. One minute it's serious and the second it's silly with a lot of inane dialog and boring chatter that took over ten years to write (according to QT)..",
50,23 November 2009,Fredolow,1, Downhill since PF,"Seeing this film with an 8.5 rating beggars belief. Tarantino's finest moment was undoubtedly Pulp Fiction. Clever story, interesting characters, roller coaster ride and a well thought out, interwoven plot. This film is quite the opposite. Almost lazy. Weak and insulting script, AWFUL acting from Brad Pitt (embarrassingly bad given how much he's manage to shine in other, more challenging roles (i.e. Snatch), and predictable throughout.

Meanwhile, in a French town, a lovely French-Jewish femme fatale plans to blow up her cinema when a famous German action flick is shown to the German hierarchy – including Hitler, Goering, Goebbels and Borman. Coincidentally, those infamous American soldiers are sent to do the same job. Also, there's a very nasty Nazi colonel who just loves to hunt down and kill Jews – and he smells a rat in the House of Cinema. How it all turns out, I'll leave up to you to discover – that is, if you see this film.",

60,23 August 2009,heisenberg83,10, Tarantino's best since Pulp Fiction - I absolutely loved it.,"Just come out the cinema and felt the need to review this fabulous movie. I really didn't enjoy Tarantino's last movie (""Deathproof"") so I didn't enter this one with high expectations. But it was phenomenal. From the opening scenes, I could see Tarantino had taken the Sergio Leone formula (""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"") and cleverly transposed it into the WW2 era in Nazi-occupied France. In fact, the opening scenes at the milk farm are incredibly similar in tone and feel to the opening scenes of Leone's GBU. Every scene of this movie is beautifully shot and wonderful to watch. Tarantino has returned to form here and works the camera like a master. I was reminded of the kind of suspense you get from Alfred Hitchcock's best suspenseful scenes. Much of this movie is like that, an ever increasing build-up of suspense taking the audience to cracking point before letting off the steam. Brad Pitt's performance as Aldo Raines is terrific and leaves you begging for more, and the guy who played the main Nazi villain, and the cinema owner girl. All terrific. Even Eli Roth didn't bother me in his role which I thought he would. The use of movie music was great (especially BATTLE OF ALGIERS in the prison break scene) and moments of typical Tarantino humour made me smile throughout. I didn't know what was going to happen next and that's what makes a great movie for me. He has made a really top World War 2 movie here, without resorting to barely any clichés or action at all. I don't wanna give anything away but this has gone straight into my top 10 favourite movies of all time. Even the use of contemporary music (David Bowie for example) doesn't seem as odd as it sounds and works really well. I'll be getting the soundtrack and the DVD. Oh, and thanks for letting the Jews wins this one Tarantino, good man!",

((THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILER)) Hitler together with the most notorious Nazis are attending a stupid plot less movie about the killing of 300 Italian soldiers in a small cinema theater in Paris is unbelievably ridiculous. the Nazis laughing and hooraying each killing in the movie as if watching a basketball game STUPID, the deal at the end is lame. whats really appalling is that the movie earned great reviews and is ranked here in the 40s amongst the greatest 250 films. will not be surprised if it harvested many awards, including Oscars, as well. the movie is simply a kissing ass to the Jewish people, but hey reconsider, its not even doing a great job doing that. it truly dwarfed the whole Nazi - Jews conflict and a pure insult to all who fought and suffered from the tyranny of the Nazis.",

67,7 September 2009,jonathan-577,10, a master popularizer at his very best,"Tarantino was never much of a philosopher, humanist, or world historian – just someone so utterly immersed in cinema that he could translate his obsession into terms that seemed not just relevant but also emotionally engaged. Now, at a rather troublesome and ambiguous moment, he takes on the Nazi film, with Bowery Jews and Southern lieutenants teaming up in a simple-minded crusade against Evil. In so doing, he offers more evidence that he's drinking from a bottomless well – that the movies can, and should, do anything. This is especially propitious since it comes along at a moment when cinema history is going down the toilet almost as fast as world history. More than ever he's playing the film prof here, but unlike his Americanism, his cinephilia is not triumphalist: he knows too much about his subject to lie about it. Glorious tributes to Sergio Leone and Raiders of the Lost Ark (and King Kong!!) vie with articulate digs at Pabst and Jannings and nitrate film. And yet it's anything but an in-crowd movie; I'm sure I don't get half the references myself. Instead, he sculpts these elements as a master popularizer, boiling them down into a teeming, bizarre concoction that is both devastating and offhand, manic yet full of grace, a jokester who delivers the punchline as if his life depended on it. And while you can always hear him talking, it's the overtones and cross-rhythms of his superbly attuned cast that bring it to life. This is as close to profundity as this man will ever get - pretty damn close.",

72,5 October 2009,Quebec_Dragon,4, Bring on the hate,"I might be one of the only people crying foul but aren't we getting diminishing returns with Tarantino since Kill Bill 2 ? I was majorly disappointed with Inglourious Basterds. I found the film weak, unsatisfying and plain long. It seems that Tarantino is writing longer and longer (and longer) conversation pieces or monologues about mundane or inane subjects with a very short (or no) payoff at the end. In his earlier filmography, those parts used to be clever, somewhat brilliant despite their outward superficiality but he did limit them, pace them better and they were nowhere near as self-indulgent as in Basterds. He relies on the quality of his actors to keep our collective interest but that can only go so far. I suppose those drawn-out conversations can build up a certain tension if you're patient enough and that Tarantino delights in doing the unexpected even with characters you think might be major. I'll give him some credit for subverting usual movie clichés, which might be due to his extensive movie knowledge.",
73,2 June 2009,produpp,10," Brave, unique and just sheer brilliant!","Inglorious Basterds makes no apologies, asks for no forgiveness, it's a  no holds barred assault on the senses. Tarantino doesn't care if he  offends, if he steps all over stereotypes and clichés, this is film  making at it purest. It's great to see a film maker whose work clearly  isn't interfeared with by the powers that be. Tarantino is a master of  effortlessly cranking up immense tension and suddenly mixing it with  laugh out loud moments; you're not sure if you should be looking away  in disgust or rolling around laughing, either way it's a roller coaster  and one not to be missed! It's not for everyone, certainly if you're not a fan of Tarantino's style, this may be a little hard to swallow, but  never-the-less, it is a film which simply has to be seen. No self  respecting film fan should miss this. And the performance of Christoph  Waltz... Oscar don't you dare ignore him!!",

If you've seen any of his previous work you know exactly what to expect.
Inglorious Basterds does some masterful buildup. It all builds up to that finale, which is satisfying and so worth the 2 hour wait.
Within the two hours before the finale contains some of the best character building i've seen, with some great acting (as usual, Tarantino knows exactly who he wants) that just make the film come alive. That combined with some tense action and some extremely suspenseful moments keep you on your toes the entire time. There's even a lot of humor in this which I wasn't expecting!",
76,4 March 2017,Tweekums,9, Tarantino's War Movie,"This wartime movie follows two separate stories that are destined to meet in the final scenes. In the first Col. Hans 'The Jew Hunter' Landa enters a French farm house and, after talking to the farmer for some time, shoots the Jewish family he was hiding; one of them, eighteen year old Shosanna, manages to escape. When we next see her it is 1944 and she is running a cinema in Paris. Here she catches the eye of a young German soldier; she isn't interested in him but it turns out he is famous amongst the Germans thanks to his exploits as a sniper. A film has been made about him and he wants the premiere to take place in her cinema with all the top brass in attendance she sees this as an opportunity to avenge her family's murder. Meanwhile the second story follows a small group of Jewish American soldiers, nicknamed the 'Inglourious Basterds', who are working deep inside enemy territory killing any Germans they can get their hands on. When British Military Intelligence learns of the film premiere this group are brought into a plot to blow up the cinema with the help of a German actress, Bridget von Hammersmark, who has been working as a double agent. As the big night approaches it emerges that Adolf Hitler himself will be in attendance along with other senior Nazis if everything goes to plan the war could end in 1944.",

Of all such films, 'Basterds' mostly resembles the highly entertaining ""The Dirty Dozen"". In 'Chapter 1' (unquestionably the best scene in the movie), Tarrantino raises his 'Dirty Dozen' to a higher plane. In his World War II epic, the Nazis' hatred of the Jews is not ignored (unlike these earlier action films). At the outset, Tarrantino's SS man, Landa, is wholly believable as the charming sadist who ends up murdering a Jewish family hidden under the floorboards of a French dairy farmer's home. Like many of the scenes in the film, the opening scene is dialogue heavy but the tension is so palpable that one sits engrossed until the scene's brutal and harrowing outcome.",

Sort of like Abbot and Costello Meets the Nazis. Or The Three Stooges' Kooky Trip to Göring and Hitler. I admire the hell out of QT, but this is a miss and the praise lavished on this movie is a sad case of the emperors new clothes. The key scene for me is in the Parisian cinema. With Hitler enjoying the Nazi-propaganda film. Hitler seated in medium close-up; moronically joyous at the violence inflicted on the allies by the nazi sniper on screen; slapping his knee and wheezing laughter from his sweaty face.

I think the film is founded on rather shallow ideas, which are conveyed with typical Tarantino slickness, but in a crass way.

This silly project feels like someone gave a 10-year-old $75 million to make a movie. Only the German actor Waltz, as a smarmy, ostentatiously ""charming"" SS man, connects. Everyone else is either a kitschy stereotype or a cipher. And there's no fighting. Oh, there's plenty of killing, a good dose of torture, but never that staple of the war film, the ""battle"" in which a unit tries to take an objective. Instead, too many long long scenes of dialogue building to little spasms of -- not action in the classic movie sense but as I say--killing. Ugh, particularly an ending (SPOILER ALERT) that asks us to cheer as hundreds of men and women, most elderly, are burned to death. Memo to Brad Pitt: Your imitation of Warren Oates leaves much to be desired. Plot: the Basterds (a Dirty Dozen-like team of Jewish GIs working behind enemy lines) and a Jewish guerrilla fighter who just happens to own a movie theater and a beautiful German movie star who's actually a British agent all plot independently to blow up--again Dirty Dozen style--a movie premier to be attended by the German High Command, including Hitler and minions. None of the ""basterds"" is a character; instead they've been picked for a ""Jewish"" cast to their face. How repellant is that. The two chicks are more than degraded by the script, the plot is silly. I know it's not supposed to be ""realistic,"" of course; but it aspires to a weird blend of hip, movie-savvy referentialism, naive '50s war comics with atttitude gore, and a buzz of irony as we sophisticates enjoy Quentin's send-up of prole lit. It's way beyond his meager talents, and as he's gotten older he seems to have gotten more arrogant and more contemptuous of his audience. Of course it's slapdash, impossible, overplayed and nauseatingly violent to no good purpose. A complete waste. And I love the people who call it ""unique."" Yeah, as in ""uniquely stupid.""",

Inglourious Basterds has its flashes of genius, as you'd expect from a Tarantino movie, but they're lost in a muddle of half-baked ideas and characters, and in the end it's probably his weakest movie so far, lacking in the one thing that even Death Proof had - energy and pace. The film does have some mentionable qualities, that are enough to make it watchable and even quite enjoyable - as you would expect from Tarantino, it's fantastically professional in every aspect, especially cinematography and sound. Some of the characters have tons of potential, and the actors are usually spot on (another honorable mention to Christoph Waltz), but there are so many characters that not one of them is developed enough to be satisfying. Tarantino fails to juggle a large number of plots and sub-plots the way he did in Jackie Brown in Pulp Fiction, and they never intertwine in any meaningful way. And worst of all, it's not even that controversial or offensive - Tarantino took a lot of liberties with history, and he certainly created violence that's more realistic and more explicit than ever before, but it's really just violence for the sake of itself. I realize I'm in a minority here, but I don't recommend this movie. I'm not saying don't watch it - there's a lot here to enjoy. But in the end, it's just not that good.",

The rewriting of history is the most objectionable bit. If the real Nazis were as oafish as portrayed here, the war would have lasted a week. The part that I cannot stand is the way that Quentin makes no apologies for setting up scenes of inordinate length, with no editing, and leaden dialogue. Every director has their own style, but Quentin does this kind of stuff in every film. He's no master like Scorcese. No thanks to Quentin for his ridiculous take on history.

Sheesh, there was once a time when a film like this could be made with a running time of about 90 minutes, and would be a good film with plenty of action and character development. Instead, we get a two and a half hour plus turkey with overlong scenes and almost no action that for some reason is all the way up there in the top 250. (At least it still is at the time this is written). I know I mentioned the overlong scenes already, but wow! The first scene was at least fifteen minutes long, and by the end of it, I was sure I would hate this film. I wouldn't mind a talky film if I saw it coming, but I expected an action filled revenge story, not talky nonsense.

103,22 September 2009,david-phillips-4,5, Tarantino's World War II movie - I don't get it.,"The opening to the film is exquisitely shot. It carries a fantastic level of suspense and emotion that made me think that we were in the realms of greatness. I was misled. If anything, the opening to the film is the film's peak and everything subsequently meanders down hill. The story of the film, as put out in the media is of a rag tag bunch of men led by Brad Pitt on a marauding crusade into enemy territory with the sole purpose of killing as many Nazis as gruesomely as possible. And the film is, in part, about that. But there is a much more interesting story of revenge that begins in that very first sequence that I didn't feel was adequately explored, as it somehow became second fiddle to the Basterds of the title. I guess Tarantino has his pick of people to work with and that, it seems, may be his downfall. There is no doubting that in Christoph Waltz, he has unearthed a gem, but that is far outweighed by the bizarre turn of Brad Pitt and needless cameos. For some reason Brad Pitt plays his character with a conscious under bite, by which I mean it only seems to appear when he thinks about it needing to be there. Where Pitt's good friend George Clooney can excel in the screwball characterisation as a wannabe Clark Gable, Pitt flows and crashes and burns badly. Mike Myers appears in a pointless cameo and the use of Eli Roth seems questionable at best. All of this lends the film a boy's club smugness in the same way that the Ocean films seem more like a gas for the stars than the audience. So, it comes across as a big laugh-in for the actors, all, except the European trio of Waltz, Bruhl and Laurent, mugging to camera in what seems like an effort to get laughs. The dark humour and snappy dialogue of Tarantino's early movies has gone. To be replaced by laboured dialogue in the style of Tarantino – something we saw enough of in the 90s with the numerous Tarantino-esquire efforts. It felt much like a film student in the late 90's, wishing to be the next Tarantino, has gone a bit too far for his student film in trying to include snappy dialogue unrelated to the screen imageryexcept this is Tarantino and it no student movie. The film also produces too many nods to Tarantino nerds (if they even exist) with the shootout where you're not sure how everyone got shot to the use of Harvey Keitel and Samuel L Jackson as voice cameos and the endless ""all the characters looking down to the camera"" shots that would have once made it new and exciting. It now seems a little tired and is definitely too self-congratulatory. At times the film is beautiful to watch. The cinematography is immense and one thing Tarantino does still manage to do to a high standard is choose his music well. The film covers a range of music that is often used in other film first, but does not look out of place here. The audience, however, seemed to be tuned into the humour and the style much more than me. There were laughs and guffaws as Pitt stuck out his chin and I had the general feeling that everyone was really enjoying the show. So, perhaps it was me. Perhaps I was not in the mood for it or perhaps I just didn't get it. But from the opening sequence that, to me, showed so much promise and, more importantly, showed what Tarantino is capable of, the rest became a damp squib (many of which were used throughout, as you can imagine).",

I think it's a pity that certain critics, specially in Italy, are determined to transform this clever pulp director into some kind of god. Maybe, partly, because Tarantino has been very clever, elevating some of the Italian pulp movies of the 60's and 70's to a sort of cult status. Italy is very grateful for that, he's rewarded with interminable praise. I fear that's the wrong approach, it's also confusing. He makes popcorn movies, brilliantly. The characters have never anything important to say, Burger King, Superman, that's the extent of its depth and I think he's tapping into a society that's getting shallower and shallower with every passing year. But, if I'm mentioning this instead of talking about all the great things I could be saying about his movie is because there is a strange force trying to brain wash me into believing that Tarantino is the most important influence in movies since time immemorial. No, he's a great director of inconsequential fun movies. I consider myself a fan and I intend to see all his future movies. This one has some wonderful touches, winking at other movies by John Sturges, Robert Aldrich etc. Brad Pitt and in particular Christoph Waltz give wonderful performances. Waltz is at the center of my favorite scenes in the film. Enjoy this movies for what it is and not for what critics are saying it is. You'll enjoy it even more that way.",

We dread what we know will happen to the Jews hiding under the floor boards. But by the time the young woman is running across the field, and it just ends with the officer yelling at her, things have already started to go wrong. At least to me.

133,1 September 2009,ptb-8,2, Carry On Killing,"This film really should be called INDULGENT BASTARD. Sinking dread is a great suspense device in any film, that uneasy feeling of nervousness you get when the characters in whom you have invested some time and emotion get slightly trapped. However, in the tedious sequences in this indulgent serial killing schlock the suspense quickly evaporates and you get to just sit there until someone gets killed. And then, in this 150 minute film, Quentin kills them right before your eyes. You must pay attention because all the hypnotized media wannabees insist you wanna be 'cool' too, but for anyone watching with film with their own genuine heart, brain, and actual courage, well QT the emperor of cruelty has no clothes (again). Once, in older films when someone died it was a tragedy for the character and emotion evoked from the attentive audience. Like when Sonny was killed in The Godfather. Now-days thanks to QT, someone getting killed as cruelly and graphically as his blood-lust allows, it is actually akin what was, in a better film, the punchline of a joke or a song sequence in a musical. Now that he has teamed up with Jewish cinema hatemeister Eli Roth and decided to reboot THE WAR (something each is too young (in every way) to have experienced, they have simply created a Nazi pantomime that is an excuse to dress some out of work actors up as the Third Reich and then graphically kill and disgustingly scalp them right before your appalled eyes. And of course, the gorgeous women in this film get defiled humiliated and mercilessly killed in the most graphic close up QT's fevered misogynist hatred allows. So what's new about this episode of hatred? Well, it is well produced hatred, well photographed hatred and well decorated and designed hatred. Then in apocalyptic episode of bullet spraying hatred, it all burns up and disappears up the rectum of the history of over praised gimmick cinema. I do not care to see Eli Roth ever again, in film or in person, and I seriously wish the entire planet's inhabitants soon realize what a destructive influence he is on young minds. QT's desire to show human beings mercilessly mutilate each other is both unproductive in cinema and a one trick career that might just as easily burn out like the final few scenes in the climax of this pop comic drivel. There are laws against hate crimes and QT needs to have his career as chief hate dude consigned to the cutting room floor. The fact that people get killed in telling stories is one thing, but QT's films aren't just that, nor are they devices to tell a story, they are the whole story: the film exists to graphically show you as much hatred in the most gleeful way possible. And for that I condemn this rotten tedious stupid film.",

And as much as I ONLY went to this movie due to Tarantino, I think he was so in love with his work, he barely edited out a second of footage. Even if the misleading advertisements were true – ""Killing Nazis!"" actually only takes up approx 1/6 of the movie, as does Pitt's character – I still wouldn't have been interested in the subject matter. I'm just not into war/period-piece movies. Again, only Tarantino's name got me to buy a ticket. In 'Basterds's defense, it was much more than just a period piece, or war movie, so I'll give it that. I'll also praise a lot of great scenes that made me laugh, snicker, jump, root and admire. Unfortunately, they were so few and very, VERY far between, I'm seriously reducing my rating. I miss the old Tarantino, as even if the movie was slow at times, it kept me interested throughout with raging dialogue, plot twists and intersecting story lines. Here we have a straight arrow plot, yes, with multiple story lines, but barely a crossover. In the beginning we get 1 of many enormously overlong scenes where a Jewish family is slaughtered in 1941 Nazi-occupied France, but one escapes. (The other notable drawn out to the max scene is a barroom conversation that I wanted to scream for it to be over – you knew where it was going, so get on with it! 10 minutes, maybe, but not 30 minutes or so.)

145,23 August 2009,jcganz,1, Beyond awful,"The film looks like it could be fun, if edgy. Bradd Pitt has a magnetic screen presence. Quentin Tarantino is multi-talented even if line between effect and sensation for its own sake does not seem clearly drawn for him. The notion of the film's plot was reasonably amusing. So there was no hesitation in buying tickets to go and see it. Now I admit I cannot comment on the whole film. I managed to stay in my seat until the scene where a German officer is murdered with a baseball bat. The convention of showing rampant sex or brutal violence on screen or stage has always been justified by the notion that it was essential for the integrity of the plot. Fair enough. A sensible notion! Then why am I so angry? The reason is simple. The portrayal of the murder of a courageous German officer was of course a piece of film. It was not real. Nobody was hurt. However, the mentality which could regard this scene as entertaining and even in part comical is simply wicked. It is no better than making a film of the horrors of Al Ghraib prison to titillate and entertain us. The parallels are there. The US troops in that prison were the bad guys supposedly representing the good powers in what was viewed as evil Irak. Pitt's gang are bad guys on the good side in fictional Germany. My family and teachers were involved in mopping up the horrors of Nazi Germany. I was brought up with first hand accounts of people who had been on the ground and experienced the evil and despair created by those evil folk. My fury is the worse because it is fired by a scene in a commercial film which actually made me feel some sympathy for the Nazis. It seems that there is no awareness as to how dangerous this sort of production is. Those few who produce this work may become rich and self indulgent which can be satisfying, at least in the short term. However, no spirit of decency or generosity could possibly have been involved in the production of this obscene piece of cinema. I'm fairly sure this is not a direction of behavior, culture, art or politics which will lead to any lasting benefit. We need decency, mutual respect and a generosity of spirit if we are to survive as a species. Without it we will self destruct in a slow orgy of internecine beastliness.",

Tarantino's film is a genuine ode to cinema, and not at all a pretentious and personal hobby-project like some people claim, with a marvelously absurd plot & structure and a deeply fascinating cast of characters. ""Inglorious Bastards"" is the type of motion picture that causes spontaneous adrenalin-rushes inside your body and automatically makes your blood pump faster with its brilliant sequences that are alternatively suspenseful, comical and unbelievably violent. From the teaser trailers and previews we've been seeing months from beforehand, it looked as if this would become a simplistic and insignificant (but nevertheless entertaining) WWII-action flick, but the eventual finished product is a massively surprising epic with style and content that very well could be the most genius movie of the year. Right from the opening chapter, ingeniously titled ""Once upon a time in Nazi- occupied France"", it's crystal clear that Tarantino's amazing talent for writing dialogs hasn't vanished yet (in spite of what QT-haters claim) and that he even improved his skills regarding the building up of tension and atmosphere. Together with his talented eye for acting talent and exact casting (the relatively unknown Austrian actor Christoph Waltz depicts the ultimate Nazi villain in the history of War movies); the intro grows out to an intense and mesmerizing 15 minutes long verbal cat-and-mouse game ending in sheer terror. The next chapters are definitely more light-headed and marvelously over-the-top with the introduction of the titular bastards, the film-within-film plot about a German private who single-handedly slaughtered half an army and Joseph Goebbels turning his adventures into a propaganda movie, the hilarious preparations for a well-planned assassination attack and the return of an orphaned Jewish girl with her mind set on vengeance. The bastards are unquestionably the main attraction of the movie. They're a battalion composed of Jewish soldiers and one lunatic German deserter. Under the command of the pleasantly deranged Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt in an amusing role), they prowl around the occupied French countryside and sadistically kill & scalp Nazi officers wherever they can. This concept is vintage Tarantino, with borrowed ideas from great War movie classics, psychopathic character drawings (for example the Bear Jew with his baseball bat), hilariously witty dialogs and anecdotes and extreme uncompromising violence.

156,5 October 2009,krzysiektom,6, not so good,"I had huge expectations for this film. Read plenty of great reviews and was preparing for a brilliant cinematic feast. Unfortunately, it was not to be. For a film that takes itself apparently ""tongue in cheek"" not enough humor, not enough action, not enough character development. Not enough violence even, it came sparsely every 20 minutes or so. Not enough fun, in general. Must say that the entire cinema was disappointed, people left in silence, without any enthusiasm or clapping. Too much talking, which is not a brilliant as they say, simply talking. Some developments are ridiculously stupid, too much even for such a far-fetched premise: the risky, aggressive behaviour of the English spy in the bar, the fact that a common soldier in a bar speaks fluent English, the fact they manage to lock down the entire theater - with the cream of Nazi German machine in it - without anyone outside noticing it, or a shrewd Nazi officer negotiating the terms of his surrender with English command... on the phone! If Germans were so stupid the war would have been over after 6 months, not 6 years. At least if the film were more funny, witty, but it weren't. Even the use of music was irritating (but for the Bowie's song). Sorry, but a disappointment for me.",
157,18 October 2009,mspieway,4, so so,"Overrated. Tarantino seems to make movies just to prove he can; there is NO depth or soul. At times, we heard chuckling in the audience. Somehow I did not expect to find comedy in a movie about Nazi Germany. Add in the over-long drawn out scenes showing a strudel dessert, or a hat w/veil being put on...painfully 'artistic'. The storyline of getting even with vicious killers by viciously killing them seems contradictory in a sense. Somehow it makes a mockery of what the holocaust victims endured. I think this movie is only being applauded because it was made by Tarantino. IF anyone else had directed it, it wouldn't even be on the radar. Maybe the only ones impressed by this film needed to be Tarantino diehards. If that is true, there is no need for criticism as ANYTHING would satisfy.

158,14 May 2012,ianlouisiana,1," ""Nein,nein,nein,nein,nein"".....Adolf Hitler","One thing straight away - this isn't ""les regles du jeu"",this is a ludicrously overcooked fantasy aimed at little boys who go ""kak-kak-kak"" whilst pretending to fire machine guns. The director - if that's not too strong a word - has ""cleverly""- if that's the word - appropriated almost every scene from some cinematic source and camped it up to the extent that ""Inglourios Basterds"" is what you might call a gay romp through post - D.Day Occupied France. There is no sense here of ""lions led by donkeys"",merely psychoes led by madmen. Mr Brad Pitt is dreadfully bad as Aldo Ray - yes,I got that thank you Mr Tarantino,surely the worst performance even Mr T has coaxed out of an established actor. He is i/c of a cadre of sadistic psychopathic Jewish ""soldiers"" whose main task seems to be murdering and desecrating the bodies of German soldiers who are far braver and more honourable than themselves. This of course is Tarantino ""irony"". There is a sub - plot involving a ""comic"" Hitler attending a movie premiere in Paris where Mr Pitt's brave lads slaughter virtually the entire audience whilst the cinema burns down (don't ask). The sad thing is there are one or two moments in the 2 and a half hours (and it seemed much longer)where you can see (or glimpse,anyway)that under all the self - indulgent post - modernism,Mr Tarantino has an eye for an image but it is buried under so much baggage and he is so deeply up his own bum that it hardly gets a look in. The opening sequence where a Nazi officer(clever,sophisticated.multi - lingual and quite,quite mad) questions a French farmer about his Jewish neighbours who have slipped the net,is by far the best thing in the movie.I even enjoyed the reference to the title sequence of ""The Sound of Music"" where the daughter runs across the fields like Julie Andrews, but that was quite enough references for me,thank you.

159,17 August 2009,come2whereimfrom,4, Another let down from the once great QT.,"So Quentin brings his unique directorial style to a film set in World War II and in doing so presents us with 'Allo 'Allo on crack, which I hasten to add is not a good thing. Once again told in chapters he impishly teases the audience by playing with the narrative, using quirky music and on screen graphics. Add in a couple of mates, a few stars and thank god one amazing performance and ladies and gentleman I give the 7th film by QT 'Inglourious Basterds'. Fortunately I wasn't expecting much from this film after his last three lacklustre attempts and so wasn't too disappointed when I finally saw it. The film they say is a 'return to form' for the director, who hasn't delivered since the underrated 'Jackie Brown' (in my opinion), but don't for one minute expect a return to past glories because this film has no idea what it's supposed to be. Part comedy, part drama, a distinct lack of action and overacting (in a film where he has spent so much time on getting Germans to speak French and vice versa with such attention to detail does he then get Mike Myers to play a caricatured British General?) cloud the plot which expects us to believe all sorts of preposterous aspects just because 'we are in the world of Tarantino'. It's crass, brash and at least an hour too long, but here's the crux everyone's cop out excuse is 'well that's what Tarantino does' to which my reply would be 'you are right of course but that's what he's being doing for 17 years, its wearing a little thin to see someone with obvious talent just treading water'. How many more slow motion walks with a funky bit of music do we need? How many more Samuel L Jackson voice overs? QT is like a child he just can't seem to grow up. There are however highlights (which is why I earlier referred to his obvious talent) Christopher Waltz as Col. Hans 'Jew Hunter' Landa stole the whole film for me and is one of the more comedic elements, there are still little touches of greatness in the camera work and audacious ideas, but for me its not enough. Brad 'Popeye' Pitt's performance is perhaps one of his worst and the dialogue at times goes on and on and without the ability to litter it with pop culture references just comes across as boring, there is even a scene he has stolen from one of his own earlier films. So ten years in gestation this vanity project feels like another up yours to Hollywood, on the one hand a geek trying to prove his knowledge by scattering references to early French and German cinema among the plot (the last few chapters centre around an art house cinema) and on the other a once infant terrible throwing his toys out of the pram because his last few films weren't as critically acclaimed, which is all well and good if you can back it up with the product. In the film Pitt's character cuts a swastika into the forehead of each Nazi he lets live, a permanent reminder of their crimes, on carving his last one he declares 'that may just be my masterpiece'. In fact it's just another swastika on another forehead and sadly this is just another Quentin Tarantino film in your local cinema.",

162,23 September 2009,Galina_movie_fan,5, Once upon a time in Tarantino's envisioned Nazi occupied France...,"Inglorious Basterds, the latest film written/directed by Quentin Tarantino, the surrealistic phantasmagoria set during the World War II was a big disappointment for me. I found it irritating, boring, and full of Tarantino who did not make a movie about WWII but about his love for movies, this time for spaghetti westerns and his interest in the German movies of the Third Reich period. All his movies are about himself and often it works. I absolutely love Pulp Fiction and believe it is his glorious achievement. I like a lot Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown and both volumes of Kill Bill. I said more than once that Tarantino does not make profound statements or ask eternal questions, but what he does do is entertain, and he does it marvelously - with style, class, irony, wit, and talent. Deathproof was the first alarming signal that more than anything Tarantino loves to talk and talk he does to the point that the viewer gets bored and frustrated even while watching supposedly fast and violent movie. It only got worse in Inglorious Basterds. Something is terribly missing in QT's vision of the important and tragic period of European and World history. Oh, his movie looks splendid, art direction is the best ever in any QT's films. The soundtrack is killer as always, and I'll make sure to have it. The first Chapter of the film is perfection. Pure and simple, the masterwork of setting, writing and acting. If anything, the opening introduces Christoph Waltz and Denis Menochet in the star making performances. But you know what? I am really surprised that Waltz's work has been proclaimed something of revelation by the critics while Malcolm McDowell who played the same type with relish in The Passage (1979) had been but crucified by the critics. Back to Basterds, it all goes rapidly downhill after the opening scene. It seems to me that Tarantino was under the spell of his own self- importance. He could not force himself to make some or should I say many scenes shorter. Some scenes only exist because Tarantino had to make the participants speak out his witty remarks and be the part of the snappy dialogs, his trade mark, even if and when the scenes did not make any sense and just went on and on. I think that in his last movie, Tarantino lost the sense of rhythm, and the film stuck more than once. I won't say that Inglorious Basterds is a total failure but it is so pointless, self-adoring, and often empty that sadly the brilliance can't always shine through inglorious and pompous stupidity, emptiness, and juvenile arrogance.

163,27 November 2009,stuart-halliday,1, Funny?,"Firstly, my comments and my marking in no way reflect my opinion of the ability of the actors. It's the substance I take exception to. I'm appalled to find that this film is intended to be funny. Several contributors to the 'comments' section have used the adjectives 'humourous','hilarious' etc to describe it. Warfare may be many things - awful, soul destroying, mentally scaring at the same time as being honourable and even uplifting if done in a worthy cause. Under no circumstances can it, or should it, be funny. Quite honestly, I find it a sad reflection on the malaise of our culture that so many (I'm sure otherwise good people) should want to find it so, even in cinematic format. I found the film to be a repulsive and awful attempt to achieve a large audience at the expense of appealing to the darkest elements within our psyche. What are we to take from this? That the Allied side in a what was one of the few justifiable conflicts in world history contained the very same sadistic and homicidal element that existed in the evil we were trying to defeat? This film is an insult to those who fought and died. They deserve a better epitaph than this skin-flick for closet psychopaths.

169,24 May 2010,pfgpowell-1,2, Tarantino redefines what a turkey might be: this is very bad.,"It is slowly becoming apparent to me that Quentin Tarantino is something of a one-trick pony. And it really doesn't matter how many cineastic references you make, if you make them in a film which is simply not very good, such as Inglorious Basterds, it all becomes rather pointless. So much is mediocre to downright bad about this film that is difficult to know where to start. That there are, ironically, several very good performances in it - despite the idiotic film in which these take place - can, perhaps, be chalked up in Tarantino's credit, although I think it is more probably that he or his producer simply struck lucky when he chose his various casting agents. Inglorious Basterds strikes me as nothing more than a bad TV movie script by a not very bright though puerile teenager which somehow gets to be made on a big budget. And that is being kind. We are asked to accept that a film which starts with the brutal massacre of a Jewish family can then blandly go on to expect to be regarded as something of a light comedy. For 'light comedy' is what I assume Tarantino thought he was making. But do graphic scenes of scalping and a man having his brains beaten to mush with a baseball bat really create that many laughs? Tarantino seems to think so. The films then meanders along a rather silly plot line involving a British film critic turned serving soldier, a well-known German movie star who is - larks! - an British agent, Churchill, Hitler, Goebbels, a young Jewish woman who escaped the massacre of her family to arrive in Paris to run a cinema - and on it tediously goes. Lord how Tarantino must have chortled when he wrote the script. How clever Quentin must have thought he was. There is no thought here, no direction, no heart. It is just a mush of ideas, with the odd scene which plays well. But none of those reasonably good scenes adds up to a row of beans when it is all stitched together into a whole. Oddly enough, it is almost far too ridiculous to take this film seriously on any level, almost ridiculous even to discuss it seriously. Tarantino has a certain gift for making a certain kind of film. But take him out of that comfort zone, take him away from his one trick, and the alarming paucity of his imagination becomes all too painfully apparent. And what on earth persuaded Brad Pitt to get involved in a project as tiresome as Inglorious Basterds beats me. If you think Abbot and Costello liberate Auschwitz would have made a great comedy, this is for you. Otherwise find something better to do and save your money.",

Even his best work, Reservoir Dogs, wasn't a 'masterpiece.' The trouble is that claiming that you like Tarantino's work has become trendy. As soon as that happens, you get boatloads of people ready and willing to hop on another bandwagon. They will ignore laughably terrible acting, and utterly self-indulgent writing just so they can be part of the exclusive club called ""everyone."" This movie is so terrible, that I swear it must be some sort of twisted joke by Tarantino to see how much torture his fans will tolerate and still praise him. Like another reviewer has already said: ""Previous Tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. This one is from a guy in love with his own writing."" I couldn't agree more. This movie is nothing more than self-indulgent and in-joke riddled writing paired with acting ability taken right out of a high school play.

I was actually kind of disappointed with that film, now I loved Death Proof, but I know that was not his baby. With Inglourious Basterds I think we were all going through the same thing as that Quentin is back to doing what he does best, writing great material as directing it with a unique style and giving the audience so much entertainment. Does he do that with Inglourious Basterds; yes.

It might not even be a film some will claim is the greatest film ever of a generation like with PF. But, for me, it is about as pure a piece of cinematic bliss I could ask for this year. And, dare I suggest, it's as audacious and genre re-defining as anything Tarantino's done, or may do again.",

And then there is the fact that there is no story whatsoever, title says basterds, we hardly ever see on the screen. They didn't do anything at all.

198,25 August 2009,DrBlood2006,1, 10 reasons why Inglourious Basterds sucks,"A lot of people are raving about Quentin Tarantino's latest movie and I'm sure you'll all end up watching it eventually whether you really want to or not. I watched it just to find out what all the fuss is about and I wish I now had those 2 and a half precious hours of my life back. It sucked! Here are my ten reasons why. 1. They can't even spell the name of the film correctly. It should be ""Inglorious Bastards"". Even with the differences between British and American English neither word in the title is spelled properly. Not that I expect much more from the land of ""Dunkin' Donuts"", ""Kwik Fill"" and ""Toys'R'Us"" anyway. 2. Apart from the first 30 minutes or so, the rest of the movie is just a load of talky nonsense with no action at all. If people aren't being scalped, beaten to death with baseball bats or shot then I have no interest in watching a movie like this anyway. I couldn't care less about the second World War. 3. Yes, it's a war film. I have no interest in war films whatsoever. It's not even a good or realistic war film such as ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Das Boot"" or even ""The Great Escape"". It's also far too much like ""The Dirty Dozen"" and so it sucks on all levels that pertain to originality or historical accuracy. 4. Did I mention that it's 153 minutes long? That's actually over 2 and a half hours (by three minutes). WTF? Who has the patience to watch anything that long unless it's porn? Not me. And how are you expected to watch something like this in a movie theatre with a Coke the size of a bucket without needing the toilet at least 8 times? I probably missed any good bits (if there were any good bits) after the first bit of brutality because I was too busy draining my little Quentin in the bathroom. 5. There just weren't enough subtitles. I don't need them for the French and German but I do for anything Brad Pitt says in any of his movies. How the hell did he become a Hollywood star when he can't even speak properly? I can't even blame it on his fake teeth this time like I did when he was slurring his way through ""Interview with the Vampire"". Having also just watched ""Benjamin Button"" with the subtitles on all the way through (because I couldn't understand anybody in it), I think it's down to his ludicrous attempt at a hillbilly accent. I think it's time for him to get some elocution lessons and then use his own voice in future. Some acting lessons wouldn't hurt either. 6. I've got nothing against Eli Roth as a director except that all his horror movies suck but now he thinks that he's an actor. Based on his whiny performance in ""Inglourious Basterds"", he can think again. Oh yeah, and he looks fat too. 7. I've never seen a single Quentin Tarantino movie that I liked. This was a chance for him to redeem himself but yet again he failed. Too much dialogue, too little action, and it looked as if it was knocked together in a week. Finding out later that Quentin Tarantino spent ten years on the story doesn't do much to help his case. Ten years to come up with this crap? I've written better blogs than his screenplays and they only take me about 5 minutes. If he'd come clean and admitted that it took him all of an hour then I'd have more respect for him. But then again, maybe not. 8. The only thing that would have made ""Inglourious Basterds"" memorable would have been if the characters played by Diane Kruger and Melanie Laurent had got nakedly gang-banged in all directions several times throughout or whenever the story lagged. Actually if it had just been 2 hours of Diane Kruger and Melanie Laurent naked then it would have been worth $10 of anybody's money even if they just stood there and did absolutely nothing at all. As it was, both actresses were wasted and this dismal failure of a movie has raped their careers no matter what the box office returns are. 9. There are no characters to care about in ""Inglourious Basterds"" because all they do is yap meaningless drivel rather than give any insights into themselves for the audience to empathise with. You actually get more characterisation in 3 minutes of a Bugs Bunny cartoon than in the whole of the this movie. So anyone who tells you how brilliant Tarantino is at creating caricatures is just insulting real artists (even animators) the whole world over. Even a blank piece of paper has more emotional depth than a Quentin Tarantino script. 10. Everything you want to know about this movie is shown in the trailer. How long is the trailer? About 3 minutes. That means that the rest of ""Inglourious Basterds"" is entirely padding. 2 and a half hours of padding!!! My verdict: 0 out of 10. If you have $10 and a bored afternoon then I do NOT suggest that you watch this movie at all. Just buy a can of paint, find a room in need of decoration, get out your brush and do a wall. Yeah, watching paint dry will be far more beneficial.",

They are a perfect venue for romance, intrigue and suspense. And the Nazis make great villains. That said, this movie was nothing but an semi-amusing parody of history that tries to exact retribution for something that can neither be undone, nor 70 years later, has any relevant or accountable culprits. The Jews have played the holocaust-card for sympathy and gain long enough, and it doesn't make them any more respectable as a political entity. Inglorious Basterds is an attempt to depict a vindictive fantasy of those who still hold a grudge around which they have formed their entire identity - a grudge that any ethnic group could hold if they were so little. For instance, just imagine when the Palestinians get a hold of the popular media. But, the truth is, it wasn't even that good of a movie, and normally, I like Quentin Tarantino. I think that if the makers really wanted to create a convincing band of Jewish marauders behind enemy lines, like the 'Inglorious Basterds,' the last thing they should have done is cast real Jews (rather, more like Til Schweiger). There were a few good performances...and the opening scene was about the most suspenseful. Other than that, it was a mess. Probably the worst acting I've ever seen Brad Pitt do.",

The plot of this movie is simple: 8 Jewish soldiers set out to kill every Nazi in sight. It's simple and it's impossible not to get behind the deaths of some of histories evil human beings. But there's just one Problem, Christoph Waltz is the way of them killing he entire Mazi command and Waltz gives an absolutely Incredible performance which ranks up in the greatest performances of all time. Theirs not a single scene where he's not intriguing or down right terrifying. Brad Pitt also gives one of his greatest performances here not only is he really funny and an entertaining character buts he also really unpredictable and really cruel which just make him an overall better character. This movie contain some of the best building tension ever put to screen for example the scene in the bar that just has you on the edge of your seat and still manages to leave you startled when everyone starts shooting and again it's all through dialogue. This is not a war movie it's a Tarantino movie it's not trying to be a historical movie it's trying to be a tension filled Masterpiece and the proof of this comes from the films ending. Not only is the movie within the movie incredibly well executed but the events surrounding the final assassination of Hitler and the high command all comes together perfectly it's feels earned and I really admired Tarantinos choice to change history. It's give the film as a whole a more satisfying conclusion. ",
213,3 June 2017,sol-,7, What shall the history books read?,"As Christoph Waltz's Nazi colonel states at one point, ""what shall the history books read?"" is an important theme of this Quentin Tarantino movie that subverts history to present an alternative look at how World War II might have shaped up with a few unwise choices from the Nazis. The plot has Hitler, Goebbels and other high ranking officials attending a propaganda film premiere together - something that gives two factions the same idea to blow up the Nazis. As per Tarantino norm, 'Inglourious Basterds' benefits from snappy dialogue and memorable characters, but this is very much an ensemble piece and sadly not all the characters are fascinating. Waltz is excellent with his cunning interrogations and Mélanie Laurent has some excellent moments as Jewish woman living under a pseudonym and operating the theatre where the propaganda film will be shown. None of the other characters are particularly remarkable though (same goes for the performances), especially Brad Pitt and the over-the-top Italian accent that he inflects at one point. Pitt does get some of the film's best lines though, including in the final memorable scene. Add in some superb spinning shots from Robert Richardson and this is a pretty good- looking film too, but whether it has much to offer beyond its novelty of twisting historical fact, as sometimes happens in the history books, is debatable.",

What I saw instead was shallow, indulgent and pretentious. The characters had all the depth of bad comic book caricatures, and scene after scene involved actors having to explain the inconsistencies and downright unlikelihoods in the plot to each other. Any tension intended by the constant interrogations was drowned by repetition of questions and painfully obvious answers. I always knew Bande Apart's latest offering would gain an almost automatic entry into the IMDb Top 250, deserving or otherwise, but its current ranking of 68 shocks me. Tarantino's easily-pleased and over-loyal fans, by enjoying this movie as much as they profess, must share the eroded attention spans of the coked-up sycophants that appear to make up Tarantino's inner circle... seals, faithfully honking their applause for a steady degeneration from one of the world's most exciting directors into the washed-up hack he is quickly becoming. I will stop short of pointing out the Top 250's other most undeserving inclusions, let alone it's many glaring omissions ... movies whose thorough production ethics shame most modern efforts... but I can recommend (especially to any other film lovers out there on this cusp, who suspect the emperor has no clothes) that outgrowing Tarantino, at least, will probably coincide with a major leap forward in their ability to correctly assess the merits of a film.

The bloodthirsty revenge theme worked for Kill Bill but that was one messed up woman hunting a bunch of even more messed up freaks and the visual art and music were the main quality anyway. I'm actually starting to question QT's emotional health. This movie makes him appear as a sadistic narcissist. It's simply disgusting. One point goes to Waltz' performance which was amazing and really wasted on a film like this. I wish I hadn't seen it, it made me depressed and disillusioned with parts of humanity. The emotional response this movie invoked in me is pretty much the straight opposite of what I got from Avatar, which I also saw recently. Then again, I guess the universe isn't quite done yet with its need to manifest nihilism and violence and that's probably why these lame movies keep being made.

Inglorious Bastards is an action/war film that prevents hate towards other humans from increasing, involving violence, gory, and murdering thousands of Nazis. A group of Jewish-Americans team up to kill Nazis to gain insight of where other Nazis groups can be found. Throughout the film, the lighting, camerawork, and suspense sounds came together making the audience engaged while feeling the pain and gory. Another one of Tarantino's films that has a similar theme to this film is Django: Unchained. It represents the same idea of deterring hate amongst humankind, while conducting actions with violence and bloodshed.

By the time Inglorious Basterds came out, Tarantino already had major success in Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, more than enough to permit him to live the rest of his life in good comfort.
Quentin Tarantino just loves cinema, and that's never been more obvious than with this film. The meticulous attention to detail and carefully - and successfully - written plot leaves the audience feeling completely satisfied. In a film that relies partially on subtitles to tell its dialogue, it's extremely effective and entertaining.
As with previous films, Tarantino doesn't waste time. This movie is to the point and every single scene adds to the plot. Coming fresh out of this movie, it's a fantastic product that I will definitely be going back to watch many times.",

The movie starts out in Nazi occupied France where a French farmer is being interrogated by Hans Landa (Christopher Waltz), an SS trooper, as he is suspected of hiding a Jewish family for which his farm was previously searched. Hans' only mission is to find Jewish people hiding in France and exterminate them. We see this in one of the first scenes where he finds out the farmer is hiding a Jewish family under the floorboards of his house.

262,6 August 2009,juego07,10, Inglorious? Quite the opposite in fact,"I screened this movie tonight at USC, and I've needed the past few hours to organize my thoughts well enough to coherently describe the obscenely beautiful cinematic achievement that is Inglorious Basterds. Have you ever seen a movie and been struck nearly speechless when you're walking out of the theater? This movie blows those out of the proverbial water. I would have said speechless, but I was able to say the word wow, which I said an ungodly number of times. It wasn't until around now that I find myself able to at least write a slightly more aesthetically pleasing grouping of words. As usual Tarantino has given me deeper insight into the art form that is cinema, but even when compared to his previous, outstanding work, this film stands out. I would go into the depths of his work, analyzing the intricate beauty of each individual shot, but there isn't nearly enough room in this forum to do that. I will tell you that throughout this film you will be amazed. Brad Pitt delivers an amazing performance that is equal parts knee-slapping ""good ole boy"" and unrepentant mass murderer. You'll certainly laugh at his Tennessee accented minimalist Italian, and you'll definitely cringe at his inspired cranial ""artwork"". Christoph Waltz defines the phrase ""stand and deliver"" with his portrayal of Col. Hans Landa, an SS officer and noted Jew hunter. He'll make you cringe with his speeches, both at their content and the calm yet weighted manner with which he presents them. His manner has the feel of a kindly uncle, but you can feel the immense tension that each word he utters carries, as if a monster is lurking just below the surface, waiting to be released. Finally we have Eli Roth. To call his performance of Sgt. Donny Donowitz impressive would be a disservice. Even in the trailer his rage is palpable, but in the film it emanates from the screen, reaching out and touching the audience. With each swing of his already infamous baseball bat, this ""Bear Jew"" radiates that much more of his righteous anger. These performances would be more than enough to make this a great film, but they're just the tip of the iceberg. Supported by amazing actors such as Til Schweiger, Diane Kruger, Mélanie Laurent, B.J. Novak, and Daniel Brühl, these roles are pushed from simply great to truly inspiring. If you believe in the raw and awesome power of cinema then this is a film for you. If you just want to be entertained for a few hours then this is also a film for you. Regardless of how you feel about Quentin Tarantino I urge you to see this film, to be open to its powerful energy. This film will not only entertain, and teach, but will also provoke many philosophical discussions about the ethics, or lack thereof, displayed by its many characters. In closing I will merely say I intend to see this movie again, in theaters, and I hope you'll do that same.",
263,27 November 2009,SteveResin,4," Bland, Meandering Nonsense","In the early part of his career Tarantino gave the world some excellent films, Pulp Fiction arguably being his masterpiece. Unfortunately it's been downhill ever since. Inglorious Basterds (""Chortle! He's put the word basterds in the title! ZOMG!"") is on a par with Death Proof in being his low point. The film could have been infinitely more interesting had it just focused on Brad Pitt's squad of vengeful Jewish soldiers shooting and clubbing their way through Europe taking out prominent SS ne'er-do-well's, but sadly we have to endure a ridiculous and tedious story of Hitler and the Nazi top brass attending a screening of a pro-Nazi film in downtown Paris, enabling the Basterds and a few uninteresting partisans to devise a plot to eliminate them in one fell swoop. It's aesthetically pleasing no doubt, but sadly falls victim to Quentin's ""trademark"", that is to fill huge parts of the movie with meandering dialogue that adds little to the experience. The film could easily have been trimmed down to around 90 minutes without all the yadder yadder and would have improved vastly for it. The cast do their jobs well enough, save for Brad Pitt who lacks charisma and seems to be doing a Forest Gump impersonation throughout. All in all I probably would have enjoyed this more if I was 14.",

That's not to say that he is now a bad director, but his films ever since Pulp Fiction have been all style and little substance. Pulp Fiction was a wicked masterpiece and one of the greatest films of the 1990s, but what am I to make of Inglorious Basterds? This film disappointed me even more than Kill Bill. Kill Bill was, for the most part, shallow, bloody and uninspired. Still, it was entertaining and the performances were memorable. Inglorious Basterds is just like Kill Bill except there aren't any fights and only one memorable performance. I'm not saying that it's a bad film; it's actually quite good technically.

270,25 September 2010,runeba5,1, Inglorious Failure,"The failure of ""Inglourious Basterds"" is the failure of ""Death Proof"" and the ""Kill Bill"" films. After ""Jackie Brown"" Tarantino jettisoned any concern with gripping storytelling and decided to focus on constructing fan-boyish collages, like an amateur film maker recreating his favorite moments from the movies. Perhaps though this change of direction for Tarantino isn't merely a matter of choice–he may simply be burned out in terms of generating story ideas. After all, one can't be gifted in every facet. Tarantino can direct and construct involving, musical dialog–but the man may no longer be capable of originating good stories, and his best work — Pulp Fiction — may have been a fluke as far as HIS contribution to the story of the film is concerned. After all, Roger Avery wrote a third of the script, though he merely gets a ""stories"" co-credit. ""Reservoir Dogs"" lifted its most important plot and story elements from the Hong Kong film ""City On Fire"" from the late 80s. And ""Jackie Brown"" — his second best work — was an adaptation of a work by a writer who Tarantino drew a lot of inspiration from. But Tarantino has given several interviews in which he claimed that he is very distanced from ""Jackie Brown,"" a distance that no doubt stems from the fact that when audiences see it they can't help but appreciate Elmore Leonard as much as Tarantino. In Hollywood, the writer-director is the most prestigious position. But many of the greatest directors have, of course, depended for ideas on novelists and screen-writers. Perhaps Tarantino doesn't care to stoop so low as them again.",

Brad Pitt has shown that he has great acting chops, particularly in stuff like ""Seven"", ""Benjamin Button"" and ""Snatch"" but in this atrocious film, he just hams it up as a twisted, 2-dimensional character who gets his thrill only from the kill (and a whole lot of torturing too). What the hell was he thinking, taking on this role?! Diane Kruger was good as the coolly mysterious Bridget and Micheal Fassbender (who was so good in ""Hunger"") does the best he can with the role he's stuck playing but seeing Mike Meyers as a general was too much because I kept picturing Austin Powers trying to play leader. Eli Roth should stick to writing and directing those shallow slasher films he specializes in because as an actor, he's just not that talented. Tarantino likes lots of gore in films so he worked some weak little story into the plot so that audiences would sit through his blood-and-guts fest. Better films about alternate history endings and World War 2 in particular are not hard to find. This one belongs on late night cable or worse. What a waste of money and time.",

But the long sequences that make up IG are really more like outtakes from a Hollywood film. It's as though Tarantinio is presenting the conversations that happened in the big budget 1960s WWII action epic when the camera wasn't on.

He's a master of old-fashioned camera-work, with bold and traditional uses of big close-ups. He tries out some pretty fancy production pieces, notably gun battles and a classic old movie theater rigged up for a Nazi gala, and these are never less than colorful and delightful eye candy. The new twist is the swing to Europe -- German-occupied France -- with tons of subtitled French and German dialogue, and even translating back and forth between them. A big question is this: can we really stomach a partly comic, partly grandiose, partly grind-house version of the war European filmmakers and at least all older Europeans still take deadly seriously? Can World War II be the basis for a movie about movies so fanciful that it seeks to resolve the war in that old Paris cinema with a host of Nazi bigwigs all on hand for a propaganda film? Besides the Dirty Dozen team of American Jews headed up by Brad Pitt's southern redneck and charged, as viewers of the movie trailer will well remember, to bring back ""Nazi scalps"" (a hundred each, in fact) -- something a little in the vein of Samuel Fuller's 1980 saga Big Red One, once planned in this long-contemplated project as a 16-episode TV series -- there's a not-so-secondary dual theme of concealment and identity. The movie begins at a French dairy farm with a visit from the most impressive and despicable character, Col. Hans Landa (played with relish and equal linguistic skill in French, English and German by Austrian Christoph Waltz Waltz), who's nickname is ""the Jew Hunter."" The farmer is hiding Jews, and Landa finds them -- but it all happens in dialogue, followed by a violent rain of bullets. One of the hidden family escapes alive, Shoshanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent), who reappears improbably several years later as the proprietor of a Paris cinema, having taken on a French Christian name.",

301,7 February 2011,yusifg,1, Atrocious,"I am sorry, but this is simply an awful movie. The only good thing about this movie is Waltz and even he is unable to waltz this movie into at least a mediocrity. I don't understand the desire to create something that did not exist. Jewish resistance to German rule was not abundant or organized, but it was not as insufficient to force movie-makers into making these cartoons; Hollywood finds itself into a familiar territory yet again: rewriting history for future generations. Over 100 Heros of the Soviet Union (the highest medal given to soviet soldier during war, usually after death in action) were Jews. Why not make a movie about any one of them? What the hell was this? And you take THIS to Cannes?",
302,6 September 2009,phanatic1989,1, Grossly Hypocritical,"I went to see the movie because my boyfriend was raving about how much he wanted to see it, and how his friends had already been and loved it. So I came in with a neutral attitude, not really expecting the worst. Unfortunately, that is what I got. I could write a 15 page paper on why this is easily THE WORST movie I have ever seen. But for your benefit I will point out the pros and the endless supply of cons. To begin, the acting was very good, especially Christopher Waltz and Melanie Laurent. There were also a few lines that deserved a laugh, and a couple suspenseful scenes. Sadly, good acting, a little humor and suspense is where the good points end. The whole beginning story could have been great. A Jewish girl's family is butchered, she goes into hiding, later encounters the man responsible for her pain and then hatches a great plan for revenge. Sounds very good. But the movie wouldn't be quite as ""satisfying"" for the Americans and Jews craving Nazi blood. I have no problem with WWII movies or killing Nazis; I saw Defiance and like it very much. However, it's the way and attitude with which our would-be heroes kill. I'll give you a prime example of the kind of hypocrisy this movie oozes. Our hoodlum gang ambushes a German unit and kills/scalps all of them except a sergeant and two other soldiers (no problem so far). They ask the sergeant to divulge information on another German unit. When he ""respectfully refuses"" to betray the lives of his fellow soldiers they bash his head in a with a baseball bat, cheering, and swearing as if they were at a football game. They took that Nazi's head off yaaayy! Now let's look at the hypocrisy in that scene. Here's a hypothetical situation: a group of American soldiers are ambushed and taken captive by the enemy. The same scenario follows and the American commanding officer would rather die than betray his fellow soldier. The enemy bashes his head in with much celebration. This would infuriate an audience if this scene were in a movie. That American soldier was a hero for placing his men above himself, and those barbarians brutally murdered him! Wellwhat about the Nazi sergeant? Well he's a Nazi and deserves to die the cruelest death possible, right? Coincidentally, the Nazi's felt the same towards the Jews. See the hypocrisy? By celebrating the butcher of the Nazis we are placing ourselves on the same sadistic level. ",
303,17 March 2022,wenbruining,9, Weird in a good way,My first watch of Inglorious Basterds left me uttering with raised eyebrows. Like all of Tarantino's movies it is really violent. However the style of this movie feels a little different compared to his other movies. It feels like a story is being told but every scene still feels real. I think this is because of amongst other things the oscar worthy acting of Christoph Waltz. I have never seen a stare that intimidating. It is one of my favourite performances in a movie ever. Rivaling that of Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. Overall I didn't really like every scene in the movie especially with the Jewish Americans. It felt out of character to have them with the elegance and intimidating Hans Landa. But is also makes for a nice contrary.,

305,9 May 2013,Ziya90,8," It has its moments, strong cinema feeling throughout, but the humorous tone and the ""deja-vu"" revenge story cause disappointment","Inglourious Basterds was a little bit, in fact quite different film than previous Tarantino films which disappointed me at theater personally as a fan of him. The movie has one of the greatest opening sequences ever filmed, it proves how genius Tarantino is, but unfortunately the rest of the film was a let down after this sequence. This sequence is an example of quintessential cinema, pure genius. The vision and the mastery of the director shine such as the timing of the camera down or the suspense, atmosphere or the acting, it is a perfect sequence, but as said the movie was lack of the magic that this part had. For example, the revenge story in this movie was a little bit bland or lack of spark, especially in comparison with Kill Bill. Also, the similarities between the two stories make it even worse! (blonde avenger, the same songs etc.) In addition, the heroine of this movie was not likable like The Bride, she was rather cold that's why I couldn't identify with her throughout the movie. Christopher Waltz's performance is jaw dropping, incredible, however Pitt is not ""so so"" as some people claim, he is great too! I have no idea why some people doesn't accept that he is a very talented actor. His performances in 12 Monkeys, Burn After Reading and Tree of Life were Oscar worthy for example. Diane Kruger is the third best of the cast, her subtle performance is outstanding. Returning to the film, the movie was somehow ""cold"" in comparison with other Tarantino movies and that annoyed me. I don't say soulless, but somehow lack of any real spark except for the famous opening sequence or let's say the movie was lack of emotional involvement. The violence in the movie was very brutal, so unbearable at times, but that's OK. Some action scenes are stylish, but some of those are not, too brutal and raw like the baseball bat scene. If the point of those kind of scenes is to disturb audiences, yes it delivers! Hitler was portrayed in a comical tone which harms the seriousness and realism of the movie (in contrast with the movie, Valkrie for example) He just shouts people around him. I hate Eli Roth because of his sick and sadistic director identity, but his persona and his role suits him very well in this movie and he works as a post-modernism tool of Tarantino. The camera usage in the translation scene was another example as Tarantino highlights ""cinema"" over everything else. The villain of the movie, Hans Landa was a great character study, however, until the end, somehow the character lost his mystery? impact? And one of the biggest disappointments for me was the theater sequence because of the over humor or the funny tone. I had expected a suspenseful, exciting or even interesting climax, but instead got a sequence that works more like a parody! May be Tarantino tried to make his own Stalag 17 or Dirty Dozen (both movies have funny moments which I don't like particularly either), but comedy just doesn't work in this movie. Another problem was the confusing and controversial aspect of the film. In a scene, ""a good guy"" of the film torments a woman to get some information, he is a hero, also an anti hero, may be both may be neither of them! In another scene, a German soldier who has a wife and a baby gets shot, in those scenes, I know, Tarantino tries to throw us a curve, but personally I wasn't amazed, instead frustrated. He did the same thing to the relationship between the heroine and another German soldier, I won't go further not to spoil anything, but many twists in the movie didn't amaze me as the director would expect or wish. However, the last twist at the theater shows that Tarantino doesn't take any side or has some ideological thoughts, instead his only purpose is to amaze or surprise audiences and gets applause! The bar sequence was great, it shows us again that Tarantino is a dialog expert for sure! The ""deserve"" scene was stylish and also powerful. The ""hot"" climax was unfortunately lack of suspense, excitement or real action. At the end, if he can rule his ego a little bit, if he can forget about the cheers that he would want to get, instead focusing on his art, sure he will make much better movies.",

314,23 August 2009,Cinemadharma,6, An incohesive film made by an inconsistent basterd.,"In the 1st 10 minutes of the films, Tarantino used about 10 different fonts for various on screen titles. Might not seem like a big deal to most folks, but it is an early example of the films' sloppy inconsistency. QT has always liked to mix genres, most successfully in the Kill Bill films, and I'm fine with that. But here, his A.D.D.-enabled multi-style style is at its most random and really doesn't work for what this film could've been. (I considered offering a list of all the inconsistencies, but my reviews are generally too long anyway.) What I had hoped for, and what the trailer seemed to promise, was a Dirty Dozen homage, where a team of badass characters are assembled with the mission of killing Nazis. Generally, in that type of group mission film (Dirty Dozen, Oceans 11, The Seven Samurai or even QT's own Reservoir Dogs), you'd get to know a bit about each of the members of the team, building some kind of relationship between the various characters and the audience. But QT doesn't take the time to do that. We never really get to know any of the people in the film. Instead, he spends a few slow 20 minute sections in ways that don't enhance our relationships with the characters, the story or the film overall.",

I feel uncomfortable living under the same sky with people who would not only take this bit of fluff seriously but actually like it. I didn't appreciate the story line due to having such difficulty with the subject matter, the chauvinism etc.Believe it or not all members of the German Army were not Nazis (members of the Nazi Party) Also if you could consider the history of WW2 dispassionately you would conclude that soldiers of the Elite German Units such as Leibstandarte SS Adolph Hitler,Das Reich, Standarte Viking,Grossdeutschland, etc. Were among the best (if not the best) Soldiers of the 20th Century.You would see this in their performance and also in the making of the man. What makes a good Soldier? Equipment,Training,Leadership, and Motivation.

322,21 August 2009,cinemaofdreams,6, Inglorious Disappointment,"Of all the films slated for release this year, this is the one I was waiting for. Tarantino is unique in that he can borrow from so many genres and directorial styles, has an incredible ear for scoring his films, and of course can write dialog like almost no other. Much of this is true with Inglourious Basterds, and yet it just doesn't fit together like it has in past efforts. The magic is not there. The film has, what I feel, are three incredible scenes including the brilliant and nerve wracking opening sequence. One scene, in a restaurant, is as if Tarantino channels a very restrained Bunuel. The other, though a bit long, in a basement bar works for the most part and introduces an important character and some crucial plot development. It builds slowly to something important so its length is forgivable. None of these scenes, I hesitate to add, involve Brad Pitt. Mr. Pitt is a fine actor, but he is just a bit too much this side of parody here. Many of the other scenes are little more than filler. I can appreciate Tarantino's humour very much. I laughed hysterically through much of Kill Bill Vol. 1. It was riveting, compelling, and fun. Inglorious Basterds tries to be these things but somehow misses the mark. 6/10.",

Although many of his films are depicted with violence which is graphically portrayed this time seemed a bit out of the ordinary and over the top. Maybe after seeing so many of his films I was wasn't expecting the level of violence as it was portrayed or maybe I'm just tired of seeing the same old thing from him. The film opens up well and cements Christoph Waltz's character beautifully as the Sly, calculating and deadly SS officer, a character the was so well developed that you really hate him and just want some him to get what is deserved. Daniel Brühl also plays his annoying and persistent character well and although you want him to get what he does, you also feel some pity for him. But for the rest, well they just filled the gaps in some very long drawn out scenes that by the next scene you have try and remember what the hell is going on. Story was less about the Inglorious Basterds and their exploits and more about the plight of a young Jewish girl whom escapes from the murderous (Christoph Waltz). So where this title comes from is unknown. Brad Pitt just rolls with the punches and doesn't deliver anything extraordinary. Nice touch to use an old Universal Logo at the beginning and roman numerals under the title like a 1960's war movie. But thats where the similarities end. Tarantinos effort to cross a war drama of old with his own unique style failed in my eyes by using Scalping and other various violence to make it entertaining. Very disappointed in this.",

And as far as that subject goes,Nazis are like robots,you can chop em up,shoot them,do anything,because the real ones are no longer human,but empty shells,ripe for destruction. So no,I don't feel bad,just as I don't feel bad seeing pedophiles or serial killers getting done in,same thing to me. As to the ending,the killing of Hitler and the rest of his staff,I felt this film was attempting to be the last word on WW2 flicks,where else could you go but into surreal violent fantasy?, I'm sure it was meant to be cathartic,it certainly felt that way to me,and my family was not hunted down and tortured for no reason at all. I loved all the characters,Waltz does indeed steal the movie,but I loved Pitt too,amazing score,and to hear Cat People again on the big screen was a giant delight,icing on the cake,just brilliant. Well done Tarantino,keep em coming!",

Does Inglourious Basterds mark his triumphant return as king or does it just dig his grave deeper? The story takes place in Nazi occupied France and a young Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus witnesses the slaughter of her family by Colonel Hans Landa. Narrowly escaping with her life, she plots her revenge several years later when German war hero Fredrick Zoller quickly takes an interest in her and arranges an illustrious movie premiere at the theatre she now runs. With the promise of every major Nazi officer in attendance, the event catches the attention of the ""Basterds"", a group of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers led by the ruthless Lt. Aldo Raine. As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history.",

I think every school kid knows he shot himself in a bunker a coward's death. This movie not only glorifies Hilter's death but also glorifies mutilation of enemy soldiers. Also unless I am wrong, ""Nazi"" was a word pertaining to a political party. Much like democrat or republican, if you were to think about it not all German soldiers were in the Nazi party they got drafted, and shot if they fled. This movies like many others paints the German race as pure evil and messes with history. There is a lot of subtitles that fly by so if you are a slow reader as I am, keep the DVD remote handy to pause it. Most of the movie is spoken in French and German with very little English.

The English subtitles for Englanders-speaking-English were standard DVD fare and easy to read. But since the film depends so much on Subtitled German-to-English translations, having them be unreadable was insufferable.

Would Jews feel happy about this movie of REVENGE? I don't think so. Tarantino said before hand that this, his, movie will be the mother of all war movies. Clearly it is not. As always it is glorifying violence and thinking all conversation between men is amusing. Well.... He should have at least made sure, Pitt doesn't stumble over his own words constantly trying to get the Southern accent right. And why was Churchill (nice one there by Rod Taylor) sitting in a room clearly done in Hitler style fascist architecture? And the Paris cinema was really too much just Babelsberg film studios.

It is actually bad enough that you were relieved when chapter three ends, only to have to sit through another slow chapter straight after. This is all a shame, as the final chapter is very well executed, and a perfect finale to the film. Yes, I know it wasn't at all realistic, but come on people, this is Tarantino!

But Inglourious Basterds just ... well s_u_x. I read a review saying that this is Tarantinos best film but I think it's just the opposite. I don't think it's all bad. I think the actors did a good job at portraying their characters and the film was shot very well. But the story is just not up to the challenge. I never thought I would say this but you really wouldn't miss a thing if you don't see this Tarantino movie. Don't get me wrong. It's not the brutality that bothers me. I just can't get rid of the feeling the story is missing any kind of depth. It's like watching a commercial and you know how boring and idiotic those can get.,

369,17 June 2020,adeckofcards,10, A warlike fantasy,"Since his first works, Quentin Tarantino has experimented mixing numerous genres. From violent crime in his early works, to exploitation and martial arts cinema later. In 'Inglourious Basterds' we find a film that also handles numerous genres, mainly western and war, with a good dose of suspense and violence, genres perfectly handled by the filmmaker.
We have endearing characters and masterfully constructed dialogues by Tarantino. And it is that in this film, the long dialogues predominate, but they are written in such an intelligent way that it is impossible to bore the viewer. Dialogues that scene after scene build a suspense that Tarantino makes simple actions, such as serving milk, totally unbearable and keep you on the edge of the seat.
This is, without a doubt, one of the best works in Quentin Tarantino's career. Mixing genres in such a harmonious way and creating a suspense of passage as slow as effective. A film that will be remembered for its great script, unforgettable characters and the classic Quentin Tarantino label.",

All the ingredients are there for it to be a minor classic on the scale of, say, In Bruges, but these ingredients never add up to the correct amounts. Sure, there is humour, but it's usually incredibly obvious (yeah you, Brad Pitt.) Yes, there is violence, but much of it is reduced to gore shots so prevalent in all horror films at the moment they have no shock value. Then there's the myriad of characters who typically populate Tarantino films but who, in Inglourious Basterds, are never explored beyond a name and an accent. Finally there are the numerous homages that Tarantino shoehorns into every scene because he wants everybody to know what his influences are. However, when a homage consists of imitating Sergio Leone's extreme close up shot technique and replacing Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach with some German guy and Eli goddamn Roth, the effect is somewhat underwhelming. I mean, when you see the director of Hostel I and II emerge from a pitch black tunnel with a baseball bat in hand, ready to smash some guy's head in with it, you're not exactly thinking, ""Wow, this certainly evokes the same kind of tension the original did. And the same Morricone score is being used! I may start clapping at the screen when the film ends.""",

I knew this was going to be historically wrong crap when the movie begins in 1941 with a Nazi round-up of French Jews. The round-ups began in 1942. What really worries me is that piece of wet-dream vengeance fiction will be believed by the morons who get off on this sort of crap. There is no part of this movie that is not fiction; I suppose this is an accomplishment. Whoever wrote the script and the producers must have some real knowledge of the period, especially in regard to film, in that Lilian Harvey, Emile Jannings, and a poster featuring a Clouzot add a gram of reality...that and the fact that Goebbels controlled film, that Hitler (like Mussolini and Stalin) was a film buff.

Tarantino is undoubtedly one of the filmmakers I least appreciate, though he acknowledges his legacy for film art. Unfortunately, this film is uninteresting, boring, highly stereotyped and has an environment that never harmonizes with the time and space portrayed, looking like a caricature more than a serious and credible film. The guilt of this is the incorrigible taste of Tarantino, who likes to transform a regular film into a collage of elements imported from a thousand and one genres of cinema. Sometimes the collage turns out to be funny, but in this case it was stupid like a Frankenstein monster. Credibility was never part of the script, absolutely miserable and illogical. The characters are caricatures and never show themselves capable of reaching the audience, with their forced dialogues and theatrical postures. It features a strong cast, where you can see Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Eli Roth or Diane Kruger, but they are not to blame for the crap. They did what Tarantino wanted, the way he pointed them out. The film still has good costumes but most of the scenarios do not come as a surprise either. There are some well-done scenes, but most of them are due to a huge performance by Waltz, undoubtedly the actor in the best shape in this film and the biggest positive aspect to point out.

378,26 January 2010,ehlenfeld,1, Let's Make Believe...,"This movie is nothing but a ""What If"" movie and not a good one at that. Spoilers throughout! What if we let soldiers run loose as a blood thirsty mob hacking away and beating the enemy to a pulp with a baseball bat, scalping them, mutilating them with no regard to the Geneva Conventions in regard to treatment of prisoners. What if the Germans were complete idiots when it came to security. Let's get real folks, do you believe that three Americans posing as Italians but not being able to speak Italian would have been let within 100 miles of Adolf Hitler. The whole idea of Adolf Hitler attending a movie in occupied France is pretty far fetched in itself, let alone throw in all the security blunders such as not having guards posted at all entrance and exit points, the roof, basement and inside the theater itself. That Hitler would have been seated with the rest and not had a private viewing spot that was also heavily guarded. That there would not have been any K9's to sniff out bombs. Then the final insult, what if Hitler had been killed, no mutilated with a slurry of machine gun fire along with the rest of his elite officers. So much for history, we are now in fantasy land. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is a complete fantasy but at least there was plot that made it a great movie. I might as well have been watching my nephew play one of his war video games. Big Spoiler Here! The movie was suppose to be about a group of men who took on the German army but there were only a few scenes of them. Those scenes were bloody and brutal and if anything left you feeling sorry for the Germans. Somehow this group blundered in on a secret mission that would get rid of the entire German leadership. The whole spy thing goes bad when an SS officer detects the English accent of the spy posing as a German officer, duh. To make matters worse three of the Basterds then take the spot of the spys that were killed and we are suppose to believe that these three Americans who spoke only a few words of Italian passed without incident to sit only a few rows away from Hitler himself. Then with only the barest of security our Basterds are able to plow down the entire German military leadership along with Hitler himself. Really, I've told better tales than this. I was really hoping for something more intelligent than this.

382,29 August 2009,jeffandkathever,1, As Painful as an Abscess,"I have used IMDM for years and never felt compelled to write a review, that's how bad this movie was. I really am getting quite fed-up with some of the pretentious garbage Quentin Tarantino tries to ram down his audiences' throats. In fact the only good thing I have to say about this movie is that he refrains from making another of those really poorly acted cameo's he insists on. Don't get me wrong, I love some of the techniques he has incorporated in the past and his odd cadence was often refreshing but over-employment has tarnished my respect for him. The credit sequence at the beginning where the font changed every few frames was typical Tarantino archetype but was so long it felt like a tedious exercise by the director to flaunt his ""artistic merits"". It was a fore-shadow of what was to come. A feeling of dread overcame me as the first scene dragged its way through predictable boring sermon to the inevitable Tarantino bloodbath. This movie is 2½ hours long and I could already see why. His long drawn-out scenes of pointless dialogue to emphasize a violent conclusion are way too frequently employed in this movie. Philosophical diatribes are just one of the many techniques I loved in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction but is now quite ""Old Hat"" for the director, here he uses it liberally, eating up most of the movie's time with tricks we've all seen before. Other predictable bits are his Mexican stand-off, kitsch movie techniques from the 70's, long pauses, sporadic over indulgent violence and soundtracks that don't seem to flow (I know he regards himself as a music lover and sometimes that has really provided a good soundtrack for his movies, but in this period flick his choices seem forced and out of place). These techniques may have been innovative in Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction & Desperado but are getting a little old. By Kill Bill Tarantino was really offering nothing new to cinema, his technique was established and predictable. The one saving grace of Kill Bill was it had the action to keep things interesting but Inglourious Basterds is painfully slow. It drives me nuts when people talk about how much they loved his movie because it's so very obvious they are wearing his name like a badge just because he's made some good movies in the past. I'm sorry but Inglourious Basterds isn't the art-house film it tries to be, it offers nothing new or interesting. I have never walked out on a movie because I figure they all deserve a chance, I should have here. About an hour in I was uncomfortable in my seat, trying to stay awake through another long, tedious Tarantino oration with an actor struggling to wax philosophic. And what was with that idiotic ending? You want to see a good movie this summer with intelligent undercurrents go see District 9. It's a much more reasonable length, has an interesting directing, has way more action, the characters are engaging, the actors convincing and the story is so much more intelligent without seeming ""preachy"". Avoid Inglourious Basterds like the bubonic plague. It's just about as painful as an abscess.",

And for this reason, I gave two hours and thirty three minutes of my life to watch it. I really wish I hadn't. With the exception of Waltz and Kruger, the acting is pure ham. Tarantino should definitely give up casting Hollywood ""buddies"". I didn't get any sense of perspective from the story - was there a point to any of it at all?! Rambling scenes followed, and the general pace of the film was slow and limp, asides from the occasional abrupt burst of violence which often simply stopped characters from developing further. I found it very hard to feel anything for the antagonist in the movie and Brad Pitt's constant over the top accent and overacting just made me want to watch his scenes with the sound muted.

Rest of his movies could easily be skipped although ""Kill Bill"" has some moments. This is my first review here and I am writing it because I am so disappointed in the movie and in the direction this author is going. I suppose the great reviews and rating of this movie is caused by new generation of movie goers admiration of pure gore and exaggeration.

Americans can do everything better than the ""evil"" ones of the world: Americans are tougher than you, smarter, more clever, fight harder, and you'd better believe if we can't torture more sadistically than you too. Of course, as a rile-up-the-righteous-masses kind of film, it succeeds rather well. However, in demonstrating the ""better than thou"" virtues of the Jewish-American soldiers of the film's focus, the film paints them as reprehensibly worse than their enemy. They are committing atrocities as bad as their enemy, all in the name of fighting evil. The sickening and disgusting depiction of the actions (scalping, etc.) of this renegade group certainly does not help endear viewers to their cause (unless the viewer is either well propagandized or sick in the head).",

I was totally impressed how Mr. Tarantino handled it to direct a movie with three languages. One of the reasons might be that he made right choices for the cast. Germans/Austrians are speaking German, Americans/British are speaking English and French are speaking French. Only one person in this movie can speak all three (four) languages fluently: the SS Officer Hans Landa. Hans Landa is portrayed by the Austrian actor Christoph Waltz. He must be some kind of a linguistic genius. To be precisely they are speaking a little Italian too. It's worth to watch the movie only to listen to the Italian from Brad Pitt.

World War II was not the obvious place to go, and it becomes even less obvious when you take out any ties to actual history and replace it with a black comic surreal style that is fleshed out with absurd characters and intense violence; but Tarantino has done just that, and for me has masterminded the best film of his career! Tarantino himself calls this a 'men on a mission' film, but really it's much more than that and the film would better be described as a World War II themed ensemble. The bulk of the film takes place in 1944 and the stage is set in Nazi-occupied France. A group of Jewish-American soldiers nicknamed 'The Basterds' have been dropped into enemy territory in order to hunt down and kill as many Nazi's as possible - a task they carry out with relish. Meanwhile, it has emerged that the Nazi's are holding a film premiere in a small theatre in France owned by a Nazi hating French-Jewish girl. Naturally, the Basterds soon take an interest in the event - since every major Nazi will be in attendance - but their plans to spoil the Third Reich's evening coincides with those of the theatre owner...who has a revenge of her own in mind.",

What I like about Tarantino can easily be turned into what I do not like about Tarantino without changing a single word above. After viewing Grindhouse: Death Proof, Pulp Fiction, and Reservoir Dogs, I was convinced that the man was a breath of refreshing cinematic air; a man more concerned with the things in cinema that can easily create a wonderful cacophony of energy and spunk.

I would have rated this movie even an eight or a nine, if it was all there was to it. However, the movie is divided in to a couple of perspectives: 1) Hansas Landa, a Nazi officer tasked to hunt-down Jews, whose primary attributes revolve around the fact that he is smarter than your ordinary Nazi and will show this in every-which way. Don't get me wrong, C. Waltz was the best thing in this movie, but his character for me personally was way too much; 2) Inglorious Basterds, who are taking their sweet time killing Nazis while barely getting a scratch themselves. Though, this is rectified towards the end in a shoot-out scene. We gotta have those! Even though, in the flash-backs we see how one of them just mowes down prison guards.

It is lambasted for its absolutely ridiculous fragment of a plot. I agree that what's there is frankly, insulting. But QT has often managed to do amazing things with such plots. Problem is: It is intensely boring. there is this thing that happens to famous directors. They forget there is this concept called editing. They come to believe that their vision, their every second of imagery is heavenly treasure; that to cut a line of dialog out of, for instance, the third 20-minute conversation around a table, is to cut the heart out of their child. We're here, folks. QT has become boring. His once masterful dialog may be in there somewhere, but it's buried in stuff that would make George Lucas reach for the scissors. And that is all this movie is--talking. Sure, there's some blood and explosions, but QT dashes through the action so that he can get back to yet another stilted, pointless conversation among characters who, frequently have no role save for that conversation.

422,11 March 2010,GloriousGooner,5, Easily forgettable,"Inglorious Basterds is yet another flashy exercise in pulp excess taking liberties as much with history as accents. Pitt and co play the titular basterds who operate behind enemy lines scalping Nazis (Pitt demands 100 scalps per member of his unit) culminating in a plot to wipe out the nazi hierarchy at a Parisian film premiere. Unbeknowknst to them the cinema's owner is plotting almost precisely the same thing. Eventually the 2 groups' paths collide in the film's explosive cinematic climax. Personally, i didn't enjoy it much, nor was there much chance I was going to as the thought of Tarantino directing a war film fills me with bemusement - like Leone directing a comedy. His overwrought self-satisfied style is all over this like the cream on the strudel in one restaurant scene. Every scene is planned to look and sound as cool as possible, removing any semblance of naturalism from the product in the process. The table conversations that fill the majority of the runtime never sound like a conversation people do or would actually have, rather they're pure script delivered by actors who sound only like they are delivering lines. The emotional vacuum in these scenes and others runs to the heart of what's wrong with what promised from its beginnings to have some substance to it yet with conversational emotion understated out of existence and the emotionless murders that make up the film's action there's nothing left for the viewer to latch on to. We're never supposed to empathise with anyone in the film because we're never given the chance, everyone is a basterd in this - the women perhaps moreso than the men and no one wins in the end. Nihilism? Not quite. Just a film that starts slowly, never gets out of a canter then gets lost along the way choosing to retire early rather than finish the race.

The interrogation scene was fresh as new paint in TR, but here in IB it was starting to feel stale, and it was repeated more than once. IB even has Brad Pitt in a rather minor role; and what about the shootout where everybody starts firing and almost everyone gets killed? The premise was reminiscent of The Dirty Dozen, another fictional story of German officers and women being locked in a large space and then burnt alive.

It certainly puts a new spin on why some people in WW2 would have collaborated. After this amazing section the movie jumps crazily between scenes of cruelty, intense suspense, sadness and farce. I knew it was fiction but at least I could see a link between true history and the events of this movie. That was until the ending in the Paris movie theatre. I hated the ending so much as I know what happened in reality to those evil monsters who ruled Germany in World War Two. They got what they deserved. In this movie they get it years in advance. I actually expected a scene after the ending which would set this movie straight with historical reality but it was not to be. A shame as Tarantino is obviously a clever writer and director.

Thankfully, I never experienced it but year after year I absorbed the horror of it in film and by the word of mouth from parents and friends who knew about it or experienced themselves the evil that had befallen our people. I have viewed hundreds of hours of film footage of it, documentaries on it, bought and read books and anthologies about it, viewed TV drama devoting hours to it, viewed and participated in lengthy discussions and yet through all of that one burning question remains and it is not necessarily the word why. We can find thousands of rationales for the Holocaust but the question of what can we do about it remains illusive.

But the script is fricking awful, as is the plot development. When you compare the dialogue to that of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, you find yourself wondering what went so wrong in the last 15 years or so for Tarantino. There's no stand-out monologues, or moments of outrageous humour. Even Brad Pitt struggles to look anything other than average. In fact, the only character who has any decent dialogue whatsoever is Colonel Landa, the 'Jew Hunter'. Back to the plot development, which is equally sh*te. The premise of a Nazi-killing crack squad of Jewish-Americans sounds good, but in truth doesn't really ever seem to materialise, aside from a single scene.

Other than that, Inglorious Bastards had next to nothing to do with The Dirty Dozen. Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds has little to do with Inglorious Bastards, minus a generalized subplot that is more like a synopsis. Instead, it is a lot closer to a remake of The Dirty Dozen, complete with a few word-by-word lines (such as the whole ""All of our rotten eggs in one basket--and we're going to blow up the basket"") and the same vaguely moral-disturbing ending in the name of committing Nazis to carnage.",

443,21 August 2009,PWNYCNY,7, Good but somewhat overblown.,"The movie is a bit long, drags in the middle and has a corny, hokey comic book story style, nevertheless the movie is good but definitely not great. Instead of an action packed movie focusing on a bunch of angry Jewish soldiers going after vicious, unrepentant Nazis, the audience is given a complex story with plots and subplots that are pursued to the point that the Basterds are almost shunted to the sidelines. There is solid acting, with Brad Pitt demonstrating a definite flair for comedy and Christopher Waltz giving a commendable performance as a suave but sinister SS colonel, but the muddled, absurd story is what keeps this movie from achieving anything approaching cinematic greatness. Solid acting coupled with a goofy story does not make for good cinema. This movie also continues the now time honored tradition of bashing Germans, which is nothing new in Hollywood cinema. Once again the Germans are portrayed as hapless buffoons. Yet despite the fact that they started and lost the war, and that it is highly tempting to mock their outrageous conduct, it is a stretch to present the Germans as bumbling fools. They might have been fools but they were far from bumbling and what they did in Word War Two was not a laughing matter. If someone wants to make a movie about inglorious basterds then make a movie about inglorious basterds and place them squarely on center stage where they belong.",

As a director of his movies, he's pretty good, but as everything else ... I've watched this one for the third time now and am finally ready to write a review. Where do I start? He's unpredictable at storytelling. Sometimes good, sometimes bad and sometimes unbearable horrific, the basic problem being - he does not know how to finish the story/movie so he abruptly just stops. Or, as in this case, invents some fictitious plot, thus prolonging the ""experience"" for at least one unnecessary hour. Otherwise good actors (except for Mr. Waltz who never performs bad, no matter what) perform horribly as on purpose. Like in exploitation movies. In this movie the ""good guys"" are presented as in the title, being no better than their enemy. Mocking? Not sure. Anyway, the story, editing, acting (mostly) and all other stuff sucks big-time. A lot of idling mixed with some graphic violence. If this movie is ""just a movie"", with no message/moral and for entertainment purpose only, it may pass (but shorter, at a 100 to 120 minutes rate). Just as Wolfenstein game. You play it, laugh (or not) at jokes, kill everything that moves and sleep well. In all other cases, it's a waste of time and fail. So, you decide what to do with it. Mr. Waltz is excellent. Everything else - a cartoon. Not to be mixed for good taste's sake. I'm not going to watch it ever again.",

Hans Landa's interragation of the French farmer, Perrier La Padite is unparalleled. Lt. Aldo Raine's recruitment speach to the basterds is hilarious and brutal. Shosanna's vengeance film premiere is poetic. Lt. Archie Hicox's confrontation with the Nazis in a bar is intense. Its impossible to pick a favorite. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, settings, costume, score and acting. All the actors involved deliver realistic and superlative performances. In particular Waltz, Laurent, Fassbender and Pitt are commanding. The plot revolves around Lt. Aldo Raines whose mission is to seek retribution against the Nazis by putting together a squad of eight Jewish soldiers known as the ""Basterds"". The Basterds join forces with an undercover agent to take down the Third Reich. Their plan is set to take place in a theatre owned by Shosanna who is seeking to avenge the Nazi's slaughtering of her family. The plot is clever, funny, vengeful, gritty, intense, violent, poetic, unforgettable and has one of the most cathartic endings on film. The last dialogue in the film is delivered by Sgt. Donny Donowitz when he says to Lt. Raines, ""I think this might just be your masterpiece"". This viewer believes Tarantino was being symbolic and referring to the film as his masterpiece to date.

Despite his unrivalled genius when it comes to cinematography and dialogue i always find his films to be a strudel without cream; a most unsatisfying prospect as Colonel Hans Landa will attest to. The lack in his previous work of any real tone of emotion and overload of dialogue (no matter how well written) lead me to find his creations far less immersive than the work of many other directors. However, Inglourious Basterds is a completely different batch of strudel. Never before has Tarantino's work been so transcendental, and never before has he made a film that i have found so complete.",
457,10 January 2013,alan-lohf,2," Earth to Quentin, earth to Quentin","Like many others, I became a fan of Quentin Tarantino when I saw the iconic Pulp Fiction. Sadly, it has all been downhill since then and with Inglourious Basterds he really trawls the depths. I have no objection to Tarantino's penchant for gratuitous violence, it has served a purpose in cinema from the time Moe first poked Larry in the eye in the Three Stooges (and probably before). However in this film Tarantino seems intent upon presenting sickening violence that is not so much gratuitous as irrelevant. In Pulp Fiction the violence was cleverly and eccentrically presented - in this film it is neither. The story is not even loosely based on fact - which is just as well because if it were, the number of Americans in the dock at Nuremberg would have exceeded the number of Nazis. The characters are boorishly stereotypical and - even in a film deliberately seeking unbelievability - lack any trace of credibility. The most notable example is the portrayal of the Nazi colonel by Christoph Waltz (presumably a nom-de-plume to protect his true identity - and his career?). The character emerges as a sort of Hogan's Heroes meets La Cage aux Folles, with the colonel camping it up and smoking a ludicrously huge pipe. Sadly, this film is further evidence - if any was needed - of the demise of a once creative genius. If I ever have any grandchildren, I will be able to tell them that I remember when Steve Martin was funny and when Quentin Tarantino was talented - but will they believe me?",

It combines Taratino's classic satire and intense drama into one amazing viewing experience. Nothing can describe Christoph Waltz's excellent performance which is easily one of my favourite villainous performances of all time. The film is able to pace all of its scenes well and the time flies unnaturally quick. The violence is gory and shocking in the best way possible. Each set piece in the film is gorgeously paced and gripping even on multiple rewatches. I easily rank this with Pulp fiction as my favourite Tarantino flick, and I recommend this as a must see!

But as it stands, This film signals the end of a truly magnificent filmmaker. By far, Tarantino's most cpensive film (more than double kill bill and about 9 times more expensive than Pukp Fiction) and staring box office darling Brad Pitt as a Jewish American warrior, to me, this film represents the end of Tarantino as an independent filmmaker. Also, taking Tarantino'sfamously witty dialogue and setting it at other times in history simply doesn't work! And it especially doesn't work during World War II Nazi Europe. And these characters simply fail and are forgettable. Most of them are uncharacteristically charmless And there is something disgusting about making the most charming character a murdering Nazi. At the end of the day, the worst thing about this movie is that it's simply not good. It makes a lot of promises it doesn't keep. It doesn't really go anywhere or at least no where good or believable. The IMDb rating and all the praise it received is classic ""emperor's new clothes"".

It really seemed in '94 that he was not only the greatest director in the world, but would change cinema forever. Unfortunately his produce since Pulp Fiction was neither prolific nor impressive. The primary weakness with Tarantino's three works post Pulp Fiction and pre Inglourious Basterds was his constantly parroting or paying tribute to other works he had admired instead of going out and doing his own thing, creating something original. An excess of verbosity slowed the pace as well. Viewing the trailer and reading initial reviews of Inglourious Basterds led me to believe it suffered the same shortcomings. To be honest, the trailer for Inglourious does not sell the film I saw. And Tarantino's frequent arrogance and more recent track record have opened him up to a lot of criticism - much of it unjustified in the case of this film.",

His scenes of shocking violence are irreverent and integral to the cartoon story he portrays in Reservoir Dogs (in my opinion his only significant work), however they are wholly inappropriate here. He manages the incredibly difficult task of insulting the memory of the honorable men and women that served on both sides of this despicable conflict.

We've returned to the sorts of Tarantino pieces that check progress with chapters; manipulate time; break the fourth wall; flashback; present us with interesting and dynamic characters that are brought to life brilliantly – even Tarantino's love for the female foot makes an amusing appearance when it transpires an entire plot point must revolve around a woman's foot/shoe.

It's just hilarious, certainly the conversations they have about killing as much Nazis as possible. The rest of the cast is also very good. Every single character in this movie is top notch.

This is not a documentary Tarantino says relieving him of the burden of historical authenticity, anachronism and accuracy. There are many arguments in Tarantino's favor (he ends the war and kills off Hitler in Paris nine months early). Most films are unhistorical in direct proportion to the remoteness of the subject. Recently I saw this Hallmark version of MARCO POLO and it was like an insane man's version of reality. But who knows or cares. ONE MILLION B.C. move to the front. Westerns are notoriously anachronistic, even recent ones like Blake Edward's SUNSET which perversely turns all of the facts 180 degrees. These are not documentary's after all. IB has been preceded by Jerry Lewis' codeine drenched WHICH WAY TO THE FRONT (1970) and WHAT DID YOU DO IN THE WAR DADDY? (1966) This film was written by one of the worst comedy writers ever, whose scripts must have looked hilarious on the page to executives with no sense of humor. These films are basically time travel films where modern day people are thrust onto a period set in rented costumes and play out a made up story. Everybody speaks in English and putting on a Nazi uniform and pretending to be a high ranking officer is the de rigor scene in every film. It's not abut WW2, its about two hours. Its only a movie. As long as you can get punters to accept the premise you're home free. High school cute kids playing medieval knights with a David Bowie soundtrack, nothing new. The difference is that most educated people know how WW2 ended but few know how the Third Crusade ended. What Tarantino has done is place WW2 in the same remote territory as every other ""historical"" film.",

Slightly sharing the name of a 1978 grindhouse take of ""The Dirty Dozen"" (the second ""a"" is purposely replaced with an ""e""), ""Basterds"" isn't a remake but another mark of art-house action by a mad cine-fanboy.

It's the story-telling of someone who feels like an impressionable and highly unsophisticated adolescent. I can't really work my way into the world that Tarantino inhabits... His aesthetic is that of someone who has never lived, like some brilliant but tragically retarded child who has been deprived of humanity, locked alone in some film vault that happens to be filled with the best bad films ever made. The result is a series painstaking homages to exquisite awfulness. This film in particular is reprehensibly stupid and lacking in the basic human qualities that separate civilized people from the oh-so-evil Nazis. A fantasy orgy of revenge violence to what end?

Waltz interrogating a farmer is an absolute triumph of tension building. Tarantino lingers here for far longer than other film makers would, and it's that that pushes the scene to another level. Subsequently any scene throughout the film where Waltz features earns a measure of this same tension. Sadly everything else here doesn't quite stand up. The scene in the basement did something similar and was also enjoyable, with a strong performance from Fassbender. Aside from that, pretty much everything else is frankly ridiculous, yet I didn't find this film funny especially. The dialogue just doesn't hit home in that way very often. The Basterds particularly were both basic and uninteresting, though perhaps that was intended, who knows... I also felt the tension drained from the film towards the end, which is really the opposite of what you want. The more ridiculous and violent the film is, the less compelling it is, but Tarantino wants to get all his tropes in there rather than go with the more serious and exciting film that this truly is at times.",

It also happens that the unprecedented influx of ""independent filmmakers"" of just a couple of decades ago has given us some of the worst movies of all time. The reason, more often than not, seems to be Ego. Having read glowing review after glowing review, these Vainglorious Bastards have let it all go to their head(s). Has Kevin Smith lived up to the promise of CLERKS, or Robert Rodriguez the brilliance of EL MARIACHI? Tarantino's ""breakthrough"" moment (RESERVOIR DOGS) was much (much) less convincing than either CLERKS or EL MARIACHI, but his follow-up, the vastly overrated PULP FICTION, garnered him a fawning following. Believing he could do no wrong, he proceeded to crank out one borderline unwatchable movie after another. Which brings us to INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS. Forget the fact that it's an alternate reality version of History: what makes it one for the might-have-been-great-ones is Ego. Tarantino, convinced of his own Gifts, gives us totally forgettable dialogue- and at Great Length; over and over. Brad Pitt (as the ""Apache"" taking scalps) does the goofiest Goober accent this side of Alan Alda in THE MOONSHINE WAR- with a straight face, too, as if he were likewise convinced of his Gifts. His dog soldiers (or ""ZOG soldiers,"" as our home-grown Arryan brothers might call them) are nigh indistinguishable from one another.

But it was so horrible to watch. The non-Geneva Convention US/Jewish Death Squad. The eponymous 'heroes' of the piece. Where on earth did he dream those up ? Unhistorical, illegal and surely more at home in Viet Nam or Nicaragua in the 1970s. What really saddened me is that many youngsters ignorant of history will think these people were real and not made up. I started rooting for the poor Nazis as these alleged 'heroes' were so vile. I couldn't understand the glorification of the heroes in the film as 'kill them all and let God sort them out' type murderers. All German's were not Nazis. Many were simply enlisted men. Real stories from World War Two reveal this. This was simple racist hatred. Were there really Jewish Death Squads in WW2 ? Or did Tarantino just wish that there were ? I gave up before the Hitler assassination attempt. The fantasy sequence in the cinema was too stupid to bear. The guy portraying Hitler was ridiculous too. The worst version since Mel Brookes the Producers. By making him a buffoon it diminishes him. Why do it ? The worst excesses though remain the unnecessary gory violence. The Mohawk style scalping surely unknown outside the Goumier in the French Colonial Army, and the clubbing to death of prisoners, surely copied from Nazi tactics from the Holocaust, sat uneasily with US troops as the perpetrators. It seems Tarantino's blood lust knows no end and he will never grow up past the age of 18.",

The inglorious team all showed up in the cinema theatre of Shosanna with the actress in the place of those British soldiers. They pretended to be Italian and Hans was fluent in Italian and the scene was hilarious. Hans killed te actress because he knew the show that was left in the blood bath basement was hers and she was a mole. Then he took Aldo and Eli Roth to make a deal with them. The heroic nazi soldier came over to the room where shosanna was making the arrangements for the surprise final of the movie. She had to kill her and he killed her too. The other two Italians disguised as waiters. Shosanna showed up in the screen saying a Jewish woman will kill them all and his friend set the films on fire. Then the two of the inglorious team shot the führer and goebbels and their dynamites exploded. On the border in northern France. Aldo stamped Hans' forehead with a the nazi symbol. It was an amazing movie with incredible actors. It's definitely on par with other Tarantino movies.",

Inglorious was that movie. I wanted to join not to review the film but to rate it as the awfulness I felt it was and to muse upon the fact that, while having a really high rating, when you go thru the reviews you will find so many more bad ones than good. You too will wonder where and how that rating came about, even if you liked the movie.",

548,16 August 2022,kursat_sahin,9, My comment is specific to the movie and the characters,"World War II... The Nazis rule almost all of Europe, and their detectives are looking for Jews everywhere. One of the most successful of them is the SS officer Hans Landa, nicknamed the Jew Hunter. First of all, I would like to note that I have read other audience comments and the only character who shines in the movie is Hans Landa. This supporting character has far surpassed the main character, Lieutenant Aldo Raine, played by Brad Pitt. The biggest share in this success belongs to the award-winning actor Christoph Waltz. The dialogue with the peasant who hides the Jews at the beginning of the movie should be watched as a communication lesson in department of communications. Being a real wolf, Landa already understood the assassination that took place at the end of the movie, but he did not stop it, as he was aware that his country was losing the war, and he made a deal with the Americans to save himself. I will end my review by saying that this character is the most charismatic movie character I have ever seen.",
549,17 August 2009,dorrianstephen,4, Average movie at best,How can soo many people justify given this movie 10/10? Is it the first movie you ve seen in years? People who cant think for themselves and jump on the Tarratino is great bandwagon need to stop being sheep. I personally was not all that impressed with the movie. I think Tarrentino is over rated.,
550,3 November 2017,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,10, Nazi-Killing Fun! And One Of The Best Revenge Films Ever!,Inglorious Basterds does one of the many things cinema was designed for: killing Nazis in the most beautiful and over-the-top satisfyingly done way possible. It's a revenge flick through and through and proud of it; Quentin Tarantino planned this masterful with a powerful and important message: 'Fuck Nazis and Anyone Who Supports Them'.,
551,31 August 2009,lchazbits30,6, Ehhh... Nothing Special,This comment is a very generous 6 stars out of 10. This is not Quentin Tarantino's best. I realize when viewing a film you should willfully suspend your disbelief but that is not the problem here. I am more than willing to watch far fetched historically inaccurate movies. Inglourious Basterds was simply a horrible idea. This movie lacked any and all good qualities a movie should have.,
552,23 August 2009,eyecandyforu,4, A Great Big Mess,"It was with the most excited, expectant anticipation that I sat down to Inglourious Basterds, only to slowly discover that I was being conned. It was a slow realization, but eventually I was convinced. I've loved pretty much everything that Tarantino has done, he's not afraid of unconventional storytelling and usually gives us a good ride. But here, I'm not even sure what I saw. Any Tarantino fan knows there will be long dialog scenes, Mr.T loves his talky parts, but give us a break. Scene after overlong scene of people just sitting around talking, creating faux suspense with sudden and ridiculous payoffs. I can definitely say it's the most un-action packed war movie I've ever seen. I kept expecting something to happen, and when a little bit did, it just moved on to another torturous dialog marathon. With all the talking, there is very little obvious humor and when there is a laugh it's not much of a relief. Tarantino (again) divides the film into chapters, which are boldly stated like we're finally going to get going, but no, we just keep meandering along with the yackety yack. Others here have stated that the film is childish but I'll also add that it looks amateur, if there was a lot of money in it, I couldn't tell. Even the finale which I assume is supposed to be epic and disaster-like feels rushed, confused and tightly filmed. I have no objections to the ""alternate reality"" plot, but at least make that alternate reality interesting, instead it comes off lame and badly thought through. I have no objections to the violence, but there was precious little of it for a war pic. The shocks often come like a punchline to a joke instead of justified. We get suggestions that The Basterds are supposed to be like The Dirty Dozen, but none of them (with the exception of Brad Pitt) even have a handful of lines, frustrating for such a dialog heavy piece. Eli Roth's role is borderline cameo and I kept wanting to get to know ""the gang"" just a little bit, but it never happens. Mike Myers appearance is distracting and unnecessary. There are no heroes, no villains, just a bunch of people being mean to one another, sadistic on both sides of the conflict, which ultimately does a disservice to what millions of poor souls must have really experienced. I HATE to get preachy about something that's supposed to be fun, but I can't help but see it that way. Thank God we didn't get a concentration camp scene. The main idea here seems to be the notion that it would be cool to see Jews exact their revenge upon Nazis. This may be a great idea when sitting around after too many drinks, but it does not a movie make. There were many moments that I got so bored listening to people run their mouths that I just zoned out, again, not something I would associate with Tarantino. I left the theater disappointed and angry. To say that this was not my idea of a Terantino film is a huge understatement.",
553,8 April 2023,crossluke21,8, Somewhat of a turning point for Tarantino,"There's a scene in Inglorious Basterds where the Nazi's are cheering on a film depiction of one of their most highly praised war heroes, a sniper who killed over 300 Allies. As they cheer for ""our"" onscreen deaths, we as an audience wait in eager anticipation for theirs, for the cathartic fulfillment of a revenge fantasy. The Nazi deaths, when they come, are not cathartic, but sickening and appalling in their unflinching brutality. The film throws the audience's lust for violence back in its face. The impulse toward violence is not exclusive to Nazi's, but a common human trait.",
554,31 August 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10," Once upon a time, in Nazi-occupied France...","In case you weren't already sure, no, if you insist on historical accuracy in all films that deal with actual events, this is not for you. Same if you want an action flick, in spite of the fact that the trailers do sort of make it look like one. What we have here is Tarantino(who's *probably* pretty much completely out of his mind), one of the world's biggest movie buffs, doing his thing, an homage to a sub-genre apparently called ""macaroni combat""(like ""spaghetti Western""), flicks that deal with the cathartic fantasy of the Third Reich's ""finest"" getting a big ol' spoonful of their own medicine shoved directly into their mouths. He yet again takes something he loves, a certain type of cinema, and makes something new and different out of it, without distorting it to the point where it is unclear what the root is. This is pure Quentin... full of unexpected twists, it'll make you laugh, squirm in your seat, enjoy the tunes and plain and simple, get you involved and engaged for two and a half hours where, while you can never know quite where the ride that he designed will take you, you're assured it'll be interesting and unforgettable. There are images that will stay in your mind, ideas you can't help but admire, and lines you'll find yourself quoting for a long time. The dialog... it's absolutely incredible, always well-delivered, and the use of properly spoken German, French and Italian, having subtitles and really doing something with that was fantastic. Story and plot are great and well-told, the non-linear time-line that our writer/director masters is used marvelously as usual. This is epic and amazing. Cinematography and editing are spot-on. The acting... Waltz is beyond reproach. He deserved the Cannes win. Pitt is impeccable. Roth, Fassbender, Schweiger... I could keep going. Groth and Wuttke *demand* mention as well. Myers, I realized what he played a mere second before he left the screen. Every performance is so powerful and genuine. Over the top when they need to be(there are a lot of caricatures herein), underplayed when that's the proper choice. The suspense and intensity this accomplishes is magnificent. I urge you to avoid spoilers as best as you can before watching this, and try to forget or avoid what the advertisements show you. When this goes for it, it is nasty, violent, bloody, gruesome, disturbing, has strong language and there's also brief sexuality. If you don't think you have the stomach for this, well, you may be right. I recommend this to everyone who does think that they do, and is into what QT does with the medium. As long as you don't think that this is a realistic portrayal of World War 2. 10/10",

The acting (especially that of Christoph Waltz) is great, the filmmaking, by the always masterful Quentin Tarantino, is extremely well done (the stylistic choices really enhance the film), and the film just has the right amount of everything! It has comedy, drama, revenge, action, style, Nazis! It is entertaining, and rather fun for an over 2 and a half hour long film!",
557,19 November 2009,KmkK,7, Worst QT movie to date!,"This is truly a painful ordeal. Any score over 6.5 is a total disgrace. Its not funny, its not exciting, thrilling nor good in any way. Yes Tarantino is a brilliant director/writer and I must admit I am a huge fan of all his previous work.",

We even share our favorite movie - Assault on Precinct 13 (ok, my second favorite after Where Eagles Dare). This movie truly misses the mark. It is entertaining in a sense. It is clearly carefully written, acted and edited. So the problem? Many of the scenes are just too long with little payoff. No, not the opening scene as this is key to the movie. I'm talking about almost every other scene. For example, there is a scene where we are waiting for the Eli Roth character to enter the movie for the first time. He is walking down a long dark underpass of which we just see the exit. It literally takes him 90 seconds to 2 minutes (didn't time it - felt like an hour) to exit. All the time hitting his baseball bat against the tunnel wall. It was soooo long and sooooo uncomfortable, I was getting upset. Boy, this better be a HUGE payoff! No, just Eli Roth after doing some weightlifting. Yawn. Stare at the wall for 2 minutes. Is that fun? If yes then you will enjoy this movie. If not, wait for it to hit cable.",

The scenes are long and self indulgent but the dialogue is sharp enough for you to be hooked entirely. The violence is not excessive but stunning. And overall - the biggest strength in my mind comes from the brilliant visual imagery of each shot which reeks of classic Tarantino. You can freeze any frame and one can tell its a QT film. The characters are many and yet each does their job with finesse and their layers are baked to satisfaction. The power of the film lies in the simplicity of the storytelling despite a presumably complicated premise.",

567,22 November 2011,axlrhodes,9, Quentin Tarantinos crazy World War II show.,"After my second attempt to watch this film, i have to hold up my hands and admit that i was wrong. On first attempt, i felt the film was handicapped by Tarantinos writing style, i felt as though the characters in the film all sounded like Quentin which i felt was a problem. The second time i saw it, i relaxed a lot more and just let the film play. I must say, i enjoyed the strands of the story very much and the individual set pieces were very well acted and directed. The use of language was also very effective, French, German and English all play a crucial role in the film at various points. The performances are also a lot of fun and huge credit must go to Christoph Waltz for what is a the best depiction of a Nazi since Ronald Lacey in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. So, another big success for Quentin Tarantino, and a film that plays a lot better if you just forget he is in the directors chair and just enjoy it for all its madcap, gory brilliance.",
568,1 December 2022,anthonyratuis,10, One of the best ever,"So originally, I had this movie rated a 9. My reason being that we don't see enough of the Basterds. They're all so cool, all heroes you can root for and who you'd want to be friends with. Then I realized, the movie isn't about the Basterds. It's about Shosanna vs. Landa. We are shown enough of the Basterds to leave us craving so much more. They maintain a status as rootable heroes and since they're supporting characters, they don't have to be 3 dimensional. They're not flawed, they rarely show emotion- all we know is they're ruthlessly efficient, funny, and exorbitantly confident. It's like an episode of Adam West's Batman.. you know the good guy is going to win and the bad guy will get their comeuppance, yet you're still thoroughly entertained. Brad Pitt shines as the face of the Basterds. It's one of his coolest, most sly characters (of which he has many)",

This movie went above and beyond any expectations I had going in, and it's Tarantino's best film since 1994's PULP FICTION. I've read multiple mentions through the years that Tarantino would be creating his WWII epic but after a while, I figured it was just rumors. I'm glad to find I was mistaken. In the film, a series of plots to assassinate Adolph Hitler and the key members of the Third Reich are put into play by a French/Jewish cinema owner (Mélanie Laurent) and a Jewish-American strike force known as the Basterds, led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt).",

572,26 December 2015,GeeZee117,2, Sadistic,"he first thing you see on the screen in Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is a title card that says, ""Once upon a time in Nazi- occupied France"". In film geek shorthand that's a nod to Sergio Leone's masterpiece of the spaghetti western genre Once Upon a Time in the West, and Tarantino has said in interviews that this is a spaghetti western that just happens to take place during World War II. But more importantly, as with Leone's film Tarantino uses ""Once Upon a Time"" to let the audience know up front that what they are about to watch is a fairy tale, and any expectations of realism or historical accuracy should be left at the door. Because believe me, realism and historical accuracy are the least of this movie's concerns.",

I've seen approximately just the second half of it, from what i've heard i didn't miss much in the form of the apparently more Brad Pitt heavy first part with his super blood thirsty 'eyes for an eye' zionist gang. And what does the film do to make jews more relatable than the nazi? They slaughter him after a seemingly between gentlemen agreement to defect to the US. Damn it, just look up some very Christian or Buddhist related stuff coming in conflict with the same type of aggressors, you just won't find such... no, simply ANY retaliation anywhere. And this is the jews depicting themselves like that, and finding nothing wrong in it, absolutely hilarious. But not as hilarious to give it more than 5 out of 10.

Sadly, Tarantino gives himself liberty with the facts and while that doesn't make the movie less appealing and fun, it does make it to have a far less impact on us as the viewers that way. In the other hand, I'm glad that this movie isn't another ""Schindler's List"", but rather just a good WW2 movie that at the end of the day still doesn't take itself too seriously, while being about a serious theme. And that's Tarantino for you, ladies and gentleman. It's not a perfect movie. But sure is a very good one. 8/10 and a warm recommendation! :D",

They were incredibly evil and definitely not stupid. I didn't mind the ending being different from history, but The Germans were not stupid, they would have never fallen into it. The only redeeming quality might have been that the Jews of WWII might have like seeing this ending taking place in real life no mater how unrealistic it was. The filming and acting were well done.

591,29 November 2009,smellysocks12,5, Inglourious Rubbish,"This movie makes it obvious that Quentin Tarantino has a very narrow vision when it comes to creating movies. His interests are American low-lifes, violence and film-making. He is very aware that people hailed his movies for the clever dialogs, so of course he adds those as well. Picture this, now we take all of the ingredients above and turn it into a German WWII movie. Whereas the genre-bending style of Kill Bill was quite successful, in this case it is a complete failure. Most of the dialogues are just clever to be clever and have the overhand in the entire movie. Quentin already went overboard with dialogs in Death Proof, boring the viewer to death and partly saving the movie with the great final 15 minutes. I won't explain how much the movie fails in creating a realistic picture of WWII, as that was obviously not the purpose of the movie. The theme hardly adds anything to the story, except for the fact that killing nazi's is a tagline that Quentin has probably been wanting to use for a while. Overall the movie does have its moments in which it is entertaining, but overall it is more boring than entertaining. Of course the movie gets high ratings because it was made by Tarantino. As a big fan of his previous work I wonder how so many people lose their ability to see that this movie just isn't up to par with classics like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. Please Tarantino, stick to the US of A with the theme of your next movies and use the clever dialogs/situations when they are appropriate.",

They want blood, revenge, and shock. Shock and awe. Shock and kill. Kill Bill. Kill the Nazis. Dehumanize the Germans. At least some non-Nazis did die in this film, but it was almost all Nazis who did. And all Nazis were bad. Just one hint of humanity, no two. But they were expendable, too. A few non-Nazis died like suicide bombers who were dying for a cause. The good cause. And Posse10 I also agree with you. This was stereotyping of Germans, there wasn't a single human one in the film. And the stereotyping of Native Americans was also included as Pitt was supposed to be part ""Apache."" Most Native Americans know that it was the Europeans settlers who brought scalping to America. This is Hollywood at its worst and why Tarantino is touted as brilliant and artistic is beyond me. By jumping on the bandwagon and cheering for these dismal works of his we are merely perpetuating another form of Nazism - American glorification of violence, torture and stereotyping.

I really wonder what the point of this movie would be if the members of the ""Basterds"" were not Jew. It is obvious that most of the voters are citizens of the USA and they like to see the USA in the first place all the time and because the directors know this and they want to earn more money they use similar items with similar subjects.

The emotions she portrayed as the victim and then the avenger were incredible. Christopher Waltz as the Nazi SS colonel was superb. Best role I ever saw Brad Pitt in hands down. For those of German descent I could see how it could offend, but you need to keep some perspective. Look what kind of stereotypes blacks and native Americans have had to put up with and they didn't even do any of the disgusting things the Nazis did. Some very funny moments all through the film. At the end, at the theater I attended in Provo, Utah, the audience burst out into applause. The movie does have some gory scenes in it, so be forewarned.

Certainly not Stalin -- the WORST mass-murderer of all time who we gave half of Europe to in our zeal for fighting for ""freedom"" against the Nazis. After the war, we starved and killed upwards of 3-6 million mostly women and children. Many people today actually think the Nazis were the least morally reprehensible faction in the war--if you consider the evidence objectively! War is hell, and this movie appears straight out of hell.

Although there are some pretty well developed characters and good acting in this movie, the script is just plain stupid. (What's the chance of a french dairy farmer speaking English in 1941? Give me a break.) It is as complicated as a Disney movie, and the story is very predictable. The conversations are too long and mainly pointless, just as the whole movie. Oh, and how was the main Nazi character punished by carving a swastika onto his forehead? Come on. We're talking about 1945, Americans were still hating, categorizing and discriminating people based on their color and ethnicity.

The set design and visuals are remarkable. I had some very minor gripes: Pitt's character lacks depth, to the degree that I felt like some of his stuff was left on the cutting room floor, the Basterds deserved more screen time doing mayhem and Hitler's make up was iffy (contrast that with Mike Meyers' pasty British)---- gaaah!

Of course the film is historically inaccurate, but they were not going for historical accuracy when making this film.Quentin Tarantino is a great director giving us excellent films such as Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill.Pulp Fiction was a masterpiece and he has yet to top it.Inglorious Basterds was a great World War II film though.The best? I'm not sure, but it's definitely up there.I'm usually not a very big fan of Brad Pitt, but he was simply excellent in this film.He plays the redneck commander of a squad called the ""inglorious basterds"", a team which specializes in killing nazi's.In my opinion, this is Pitt's best role! He is simply hilarious in an otherwise dark war film.Eli Roth and Sam Levine also play members of the ""basterds"".The plot of the film involves two groups of people who are trying to kill Hitler and the other nazi's.One group is ""the basterds"", the others are two people who run a movie theatre.The woman who runs it had her family killed by the nazi's years earlier and wants revenge.There is a German officer who is smitten by her as well.The acting & characters are top-notch.It is very violent, which is expected for a Tarantino film, though there is not too much action.A problem I had with this film was that it dragged quite a bit.A lot of Tarantino films do this, but a lot of the time, it works.Some of it works here as well, I found that the opening scene was somewhat of a nod to the apartment scene in Pulp Fiction.We knew something bad was going to happen, however the two characters just converse as the suspense builds.They could have definitely shortened this film a bit.

My short take is that if you want something as fresh as Pulp Fiction or as eye popping as Kill Bill you will be disappointed. This film plods painfully along in the first half, setting up the later story but not in a slick way like his earlier work. It almost stumbles through the usual QT violence (although less gratuitously than you might expect from the trailers) before flowing nicely for the last half hour. It is like the first half of the film was edited by a student. Brad Pitt is a caricature and most of his band of merry men are not very well developed. The villain is maybe the best fleshed out and most interesting. Not to say Pitt isn't good because you want to laugh every time he opens his mouth and he looks like he's having fun.

Inglourious Basterds is not what I thought it was. That's not a bad thing, or a good thing really just an observation. I took the film at face value which appeared to be about a group of misfits put together by a rough talking military man who goes about torturing and putting vengeance on Nazis. Some of that does happen but as it turns out the film is more about the final battle of this group of misfits after they have already made a name for themselves. It also follows another storyline extensively as much as the Inglourious Basterds if not more so. One of the more impressive features of this film is that the Nazi's are consistently on the run in this film. This is like the Return of The Jedi for Jews in World War 2 which I can't say I have ever seen. With the help of the brutal basterds as well as some smart and savvy war victims the Nazi's get a Taratino dose of vengeance, something he does with bloody, gore soaked style.",

Although they aim to destroy the Nazi war machine, their immediate target is Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) who fancies himself the best soldier in the German army. Actually he is one dispassionate, indiscriminate and certainly the most vicious Nazi in France. In the film one of his victims named Shosanna, (Mélanie Laurent) recalls the slaughter of her family and vows vengeance. With the exceptional talents of special guest star Rod Taylor (Dark of the Sun; signature theme included) Til Schweiger and Martin Wuttke who plays Hitler, in addition with a screen full of dramatic, sometimes brutal action, this movie proves both entertaining and with the 'Tiger tank theme' becomes morbidly exciting. The movie is not for the faint hearted, but will literally set the screen on fire. Great film. ****",

Quirky, blazing with the kind of wit that Tarantino is famous for and topped off with a dose of nasty, gritty and rogueish violence. This movie is pretty sprawling, featuring a host of characters and plot niches that span over a huge 2.5 hour timeline, and surprisingly it manages to entertain for most of it, despite some scenes that could have been trimmed down for the sake of the story. Throughout its duration, Basterds delivers memorable scenes, memorable and witty dialogue and outrageously precise directing that all comes together for a smash hit of a movie, right on the bullseye.

Best actors in the movie was Christoph Waltz, whom I was able to enjoy. The story however can be told in two minutes without leaving anything out and every dialog is among the worst I've seen. The constant self-justification was so annoying. Even mediocre movies don't need to go that low. Plus it was plain boring. If I wasn't one of the many Tarantino fans, I'd never have watched till the end. There is just nothing remarkable about this movie. I have no clue how this move made it to #56 or even into the top 250. It's not even the good kind of crap. DON'T WATCH!",

I don't what came across, maybe I just thought Tarantino did not have it in him anymore to make another Pulp Fiction. Well, he proved me wrong in the opening credits, which opens with a glorious Ennio Morricone Spaghetti Western theme over a Kill Bill style credits sequence. I just knew he had not disappointed, and after the intense first ten minutes, which I must say are truly stunning, I was bought, this is Tarantino's best movie since Pulp Fiction. It has everything that makes a movie perfect: an eccentric cast where no one actor can be faulted, an amazing soundtrack, stylistic camera-work, an intricate and twisting plot and an outrageous ending.",

656,13 September 2009,meeza,10, The inglorious glory of Tarantino reigns!,"Ingloury, Ingloury alleluyah, Tarantino has laid it down! The Q is back in Director monarchy status with his rocking orchestration of ""Inglourious Basterds"". The I.B.'s (see film title) are a renegade squad of Jewish-Americans with a German Nazi killer who go on a mission in Nazi occupied France to hunt down and dismember the Nazialites during World War II. The Basterds are led by redneck Lt. Aldo Raine, a scowl-gestured feisty leader who is one damn funny basterd, and has a zero-tolerance sympathy for the germy Nazi Germans. Brad Pitt's brilliant performance as Raine was a shower of comic delight. The rest of the Basterds include: Sgt. Donny Donowitz, a baseball bat basher who hits Nazi brains out of the war park; Pfc. Omar Ulmer, a Nazi brain dismembering specialist who definitely makes the Basterd cut right; Private Smithson Utivich, the quiet Basterd who Nazis nickname ""The Little Man"" without him knowing; Lt. Archie Hicox, the undercover Basterd who needed to take some foreign accentuation classes before his spy gigs; and last but not least, the German beast Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz, a bulky German who is famed for brutally murdering Nazis and therefore ends up a Basterd. The beastly basterd supporting thespian work of Eli Roth as Donowitz, Omar Doom as Ulmer, B.J. Novak as Utivich, Michael Fassbender as Hicox, and Til Schweiger as Stiglitz was Basterd grunt euphoria! Not since the ""Saving Private Ryan"" grunts have I witnessed some fine acting in a movie war squad! OK Meeza, at ease! Now let's move to the dark side, the Nazis. Christoph Waltz plays the verbally manipulative Nazi Colonel Hans Landa, his specialty is to find hiding Jews in all of France at all costs. Hans is the premier villain of the film, yes even above Der Fuehrer himself. I have not witnessed such a despicable, but yet quite charming, villain in a film since I witnessed another Hans twenty years ago that being Hans Gruber in ""Die Hard"". Waltz' virtuoso performance will waltz him into the Oscar dance with a Best Supporting Actor nomination, and even a win. Some commanding Nazi supporting acting turns were also executed by Daniel Bruhl as Private Fredrick Zoller, a Nazi war hero who stars in a movie based on his sniper work in killing thousands of Jews; and August Diehl who plays Dieter Hellstrom, a supercilious German Major who grows suspicious of Hicox's fake German accent and partakes with some of the Basterd undercovers in a drunken game at a basement tavern. Hell, even Martin Wuttke was not bad playing Hitler himself; that is the only time you will see ""not bad"" and ""Hitler"" in the same sentence. And what about the chicks? Shosanna Dreyfus might be just considered the central character of the film. Dreyfus is a France theatre owner who lost her entire family during one of Landa's Jew seeking expeditions a few years ago. With inglorious intervention a few years later, she is confronted with devilish Hans again when he is self-assigned the role of Security Head for the premiere of Zoller's sniper film at Dreyfus' theatre. Consequently, Shosanna comes up with a fiery plan to eradicate all Nazi officers attending the premiere in her theatre. Melanie Laurent's work as Dreyfus was of Best Saint Laurent scent. Another delightful fem performance was delivered by Diane Kruger playing famed German actress Bridget Von Hammersmark, who is also set her mark in rightfully betraying her country by hammering some Nazis, and even congregates with the heroic I.B.'s to eradicate the Nazis at the film premiere in Shosanna's theatre. Yes, there is a myriad of plot developments within the movie, but Quentin would not have it any other way. Tarantino's screenplay was masterful as the dialogue itself within the characters symbolized the red flags of bloody red violence lurking thereafter. No one develops this form of verbal antecedent better than Tarantino, as he has also formulated it proficiently in his past films. It has become the Q's original writer-director niche. Quentin most certainly deserves Best Director & Best Screenplay Oscar nominations for his stellar film-making of ""Inglourious Basterds"". The Academy would be the new Inglorious Bastards if they fire him with snubs. Tarantino's glorious film-making team also made their mark! Robert Richardson's cinematography & Sebastian Krawinkel's art direction were cine veritas on the authenticity of Nazi-occupied France. As in most of Quentin's films, the music & the score played integral parts in ""Inglourious Basterds"" developments, and the hip glorious tunes tuned us all attentively. OK, I know I have been a critical basterd by elongating this film review! But I just wanted to provide you a cut-by-cut analysis on the masterpiece entitled ""Inglourious Basterds"". ***** Excellent",

658,29 May 2019,Loinaa,10, THAT'S A BINGOOO!!!,"Inglorious Basterds definitely became one of my all time favourite movies! Why? Well as Tarantino said he wants the audience to feel the emotions and he makes the movie in a way that it's basically planned when you should feel a specific emotion. That's what makes a great movie. I had all the spectrum of emotions while watching this film. I laughed, I cried, I was scared, nervous, I had anticipation....I never thought that I would like a WW2 movie and especially not one about Nazis. But now I can't actually believe and It's weird to say but Hans Landa has become one of my favourite character from a movie... I mean how great is Christoph Waltz??? Without Christoph Waltz I wouldn't have enjoyed the movie as much. He played the best antagonist I've ever seen. And then of course there's so much more that made this movie a masterpiece: The music was just mesmerizing, Brad Pitt played a fabulous role (loved his accent), the cinematography was beautiful and the long scenes built such an amazing tention. Another point that made it so special was that it wasn't only in english. I just loved the fact that it was in german, french, english and Italian (bawn gewrnow ;-)). It made me realise a lot about languages especially for me because I speak exactly those languages. So the first tim I watched it, it was funny because I didn't even realise that they changed language!
I just wanna thank Mr. Quentin Tarantino for always reminding me why I love watching movies and for always making such great masterpieces! That's pure Art. If this movie was a Canvas I would put it in the Louvre! So Merci, Dankeschön, Thank You and Grawzi:-)",

Inglourious Basterds is a sprawling, rhapsodic, triumphant, ridiculously original cinematic experience","Originality and Passion is something that is relatively scarce in the contemporary film industry, many directors now simply produce films for the whopping pay check after release (Michael Bay, Jason Friedberg...). Yet, Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is a gleaming example that there is still raw passion and bundles of originality nestled in the undercurrents of cinema. Tarantino's films most definitely have an acquired taste, his style is marred with obscure film references, heavy dialogue, dark comedy and you'd usually expect his characters to go into a burst of pointless chit-chat about pop culture. This is what his cinema is and he sticks to his guns, he's not tempted by the majority audience to cash in on. The beauty of Inglourious Basterds is that he sticks to his style, but he puts it into a totally different use to produce a wacky piece of cinema of the like that I've never seen before or never will!",

666,28 August 2015,Screen_Blitz,9, Quentin Tarantino's audacious revenge fantasy deliver a sucker punch of darkly funny entertainment,"Quentin Tarantino brings his snappy filmmaking methodology and signature dark humor in the European front of World War II in this black comedy. The story on board here is a revenge fantasy against the sadistic dictator Adolf Hitler, leader of the Third Reich who threatened to dominate the eastern hemisphere during the early years of World War II. As opposed to be the typical Hollywood formula which often offers a more somber take on the grim subject matter, Tarantino defies against the usual standards, placing his tongue in his cheek with snappy, yet darkly funny dialogue and wildly colorful characters that suitably match up with his bold artistic style. The film is very talky with sudden bursts of graphic violence punctuating each sequence, but one thing that is for sure is that Tarantino is always consistent with keeping things bold and satirically funny while staying true its subversive nature. Set in the early 1940s, this film follows Lieutenant Aldo Raine (played by Brad Pitt), a bold-spirited American soldier who rallies up a team of young Jewish soldiers on a mission to murder Nazis in attempt to pursue after Third Reich leader Adolf Hitler. And he has a baseball- wielding Donny Donowitz (played by Eli Roth) at his assistance. This plan unexpectedly coincides with a similar plot hosted by German actress Bridget Von Hammersmark (played by Diane Kruger) and Shosanna Dreyfus (played by Melanie Laurent), an owner of a French movie theater, who has plans hosting a Nazi propaganda movie for the Nazi Party; which will allow her to burn down the theater to kill the party in revenge for the murder of her family at the hands of one of Hitler's sinister accomplices SS Colonel Hans Landa (played by Christoph Waltz) ",

It's not like I went to this film expecting an all out serious movie, but this one stayed true to Hollywood's long line of anti-German American's the greatest 'war' films. Like we've come to expect, the Germans were portrayed as dirty monsters, idiots and murderers. I believe World War 2 was a disaster of epic proportions and am in no way advocating the crimes and horrors that some Germans were involved with, but I find it extremely sad what our sense of history has come to. How people can sit there, eating their junk food, laughing, cheering, as someone gets scalped, have their head beat in with a bat, a swastika carved in their flesh, is beyond me and I find it extremely disturbing. It's really amazing what passes for a good movie these days, and the fact that this movie is so highly acclaimed is a testimony to that and may just be evidence of a specific decline in humanity.",

It's not true that you take real events in history and use them to make movie like cartoon or funny story. You have to show respect to Jewish people's suffer. It's not your job that take revenge from history. I think real problem about Tarantino is that his observation come from movies not real world, i mean his inspiration is cinema not reality. It's wrong when subject is making film about historical truth. You may say that ""come on it's just a movie"", but nowadays many people learn history from cinema, if more people say that ""This is my imaginary, i can put into it everything i want"" and make stupid films about history like this then next generations believe fact that actually did not happen. For instance Will Smith's movie Wild Wild West. How sick people put black agent or detective (whatever) in that century of America. I mean that you cant distort history or reality. Germans killed Jews (Yes, Germans because they voted for Hitler and after the war everyone said ""i am not one of them they forced me..."" nobody buying this) and Jews did not do anything, they just waited to die. And Americans use blacks for slave. You cant change all of this historical truths. If you wanna do movie you have to open your eyes and look what happening in the world or what happened in the past.
