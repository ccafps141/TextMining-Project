Simin wishes to live abroad to give a better life to her eleven year-old daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) and Nader, who is a family man but very arrogant, wants to stay to take care of his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) that has Alzheimer. Simin moves to the house of her mother and Nader hires the religious Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to take care of his father while he is working. ",/

3,16 February 2011,Radu_A,10, The Swan Song of Iranian cinema?,"Asghar Farhadi's new film after the ingenious 'About Elly' is running for the Golden Bear at this year's Berlin Film Festival and, with half of the competition done and the rest of the program not looking too promising, appears to be an almost inevitable winner. Although maybe it won't for that very reason: Jahar Panahi's repeat inability to attend his jury duties because of Iran's government refusal to issue him a travel permit, a retrospective of his works including the 2006 Silver Bear-winning 'Offside', a variety of other Iranian productions and renewed demonstrations in Iran proper put the spotlight firmly on that country's elaborate, yet constrained film industry. All that buzz may outshine the film's artistic value, and prompt the jury to go for a less favored competitor. I should hope not, for Farhadi manages once again to embed lots of social criticism into a straight-laced, realistic narrative.",v

7,25 March 2011,mrbarooee,10, unsaid words can turn into a separation,"It seems that a court room drama could be the best place for Frahadi to recreate his very own world and confront us with a short and somehow faraway situations and incidents in life. We think these kinds of happenings and conflicts would not take place in our lives but with his realistic world and characters they seem so close and possible to anyone. Asghar Farhadi loves to put his audience in place of judge, as his other pictures like About Eli or Fireworks Wednesday and here with no fear he takes us straight to a court room. But the thing is that the judge does not provide any help for us to make a clear judgment and surprisingly makes the situation even more complicated. Yes Farhadi doesn't want us to make a judgment, He makes us watch and observe and leave the theater with a big fork in front of us.It Seems that any single decision creates another world full of forks and not taken ways.",/
8,1 February 2012,planktonrules,9," While not especially pleasant viewing, it's a very complex film--the sort that will get you and your friends talking.","Over the years, I have watched perhaps thousands of international films. And, I've come to be impressed by the films of three countries--France, Japan and, surprisingly, Iran. In fact, although I've seen far fewer Iranian films than either Japanese or French, the Iranian films have always been exceptional...always. Their track record with films you can see here in the States is amazing. Part of it is because the nation has produced Majid Majidi--a truly brilliant filmmaker who, oddly, has only received on Oscar nomination and no wins. Yet, easily, he could have won several times with such brilliant films as ""Chidlren of Heaven"", ""The Color of Paradise"", ""The Willow Tree"" and ""Baran"". I have also seen several other wonderful film by other Iranian directors. So, I was quite interested in seeing ""A Separation"" when it arrived at a local theater. And, I am glad I had a chance to see it.",r
9,7 April 2013,TheLittleSongbird,10, For me A Separation is definitely one of the best films of 2011,"Hearing how highly regarded A Separation was among my IMDb friends, I knew I had to see it. My only question is how on earth did it take so long for me to do so? I can only put it down to being behind with my film watching because of uni, because A Separation is a fantastic film and deserves all ounces of praise it gets and some. That is my opinion though, because I know people will find that it is not their cup of tea and have no problem with that. What was it I loved about A Separation? A lot of things actually. It was a very well made film. The scenery is striking and authentic, and the cinematography is intrusive and relentlessly, but this adds to the impact of the story rather than detracts from it. Asghar Farhadi's direction similarly is supremely controlled. A Separation is remarkably written as well. The writing is intelligent and insightful, avoiding any kind of melodrama or moralising. Not just that but it succeeds also in exploring the characters without any kind of prejudice, and that is including Hodjat. The story is quite a complicated set-up, but compelling and moving. It gives the audience time to breathe, but with the tension and drama that fuels what is happening in the storytelling I found myself never being able to look away. The characters are sensitively explored, and while I've not seen About Elly in a while I do remember that I didn't relate as much to the characters there than I did here. The acting is wonderful, Leila Hatami(especially good), Peyman Moadi, Shahab Hosseini and Sareh Bayat give performances that wholly justified the sharing of the Silver Berlin Bear. One mustn't forget Sarina Farhadi, whose increasing intensity in her acting is what makes A Separation's storytelling and the case it depicts even more engrossing. In conclusion, one of the best of 2011, considering how hit and miss that year was for films that's saying a bit. 10/10 Bethany Cox",w
10,2 December 2011,jsrees,10," thoughtful, brilliant film","This is the first Iranian film I've seen, and I'm recommending it to every-one I know. It is so well-crafted; the twists of the plot throw up new moral dilemmas for all the protagonists, which are explored sensitively and without judgement - so refreshingly unlike mainstream American films. I felt sympathy for all the characters, even the threatening Hodjat, full of misplaced rage which often erupts volcanically. And as a footnote, the film felt like an intimate view into a society that our news media portray as monochromatic and extremely foreign.

I watched Farhady's previous film (About Elly) about a year ago, and the first thing which struck me was how culturally detached the movie was in its depiction of an event.

They each have their side of the story. Simin desires to leave their country, as she does not want her eleven-year-old daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), growing up under current conditions. Nader, on the other hand, wants to stay so that he can look after his elderly father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), now in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease.

For all the hate-filled rhetoric spewed about Iran, this film should show the world, like so many other Iranian films, what brilliant artistry exists in this nation, what sensitive beautiful people Iranians are. Iranian actors have been honed and trained since the 1970's when the modern era of Iranian film began. The principal actors: Leila Hatami, Peyman Moaadi, Shahab Hosseini, Sareh Bayat, and Sarina Farhadi (the director's own daughter) are superb. From the first moments of the film you believe them and the truth of their existence. The stark intimacy of the film is stunning.

How does one give care to a loved one, especially if they're older and unaware where they are (as happens to the old grandfather in this film)? What about how things don't happen on-a-dime, so to speak, but feelings of betrayal and distrust grow eventually, piece by piece? In Farhadi's hands, and through his actors, people are trying to figure things out, trying to make sense of the people around them, about the trust, about people's behaviors, about things that can be taken for granted like love. There's not much, if at all, sentimentality in this approach, which makes it so affecting and effective.",=
24,5 March 2012,joeaneal,10," A lot of complexity of life, relative to all cultures",I was expecting an excellent film and got even more than I expected. I was lucky enough to have an Irani friend for about six years before I moved from Northern California. During those six years I began to see a humanity in my friend that I did not expect. Like almost everyone in America we have been taught that Iran is our enemy. That their religious beliefs were so different than ours that there was little hope of closing that gap. That reconciling those differences would forever cause us a chasm. Or at the very least a great tension.,t
25,9 January 2012,SheldonChau,10, A Separation (2011),"Gripping, tense, heartfelt, powerful, painful, and stirring, Asghar Farhadi's A SEPARATION is an intense drama that captivates like a thriller by boasting astounding performances and a truly compelling narrative arc. It is an Iranian film that centers on intimate domestic issues in the midst of extremely difficult circumstances - a purely humanistic narrative that gets better and better as it progresses, building upon layer after layer after layer of dense situations in which these poor characters are helplessly engulfed within. In creating a plethora of deep emotions that are carried out honestly and never over-the-top by the ensemble's pitch-perfect performances, Farhadi manages to weave together multiple angles that are both morally complex and excruciatingly truthful into each and every one of his primary characters (all of whom exist in the middle-to-lower class) . The plot is patiently set up with its pieces slowly establishing in place in the first few scenes before snaring the audience into a wonderfully played 123-minute thrill ride that places viewers right beside its characters - a feat that is executed through its seemingly naturally-crafted hand- held cinematography in conjunction with genuine acting that rarely calls attention to itself.

26,17 January 2012,estebangonzalez10,9, Strong Iranian film,"¨What is wrong is wrong, no matter who said it or where it's written.¨ Critics have been raving about this Iranian film and after finally getting the chance to see it I can see why they were so pleased with this social drama. It is a very well told story with great performances. Filmed mostly with a hand-held camera, the movie feels very authentic and real. At moments you forget you are seeing a movie, and feel like you are watching a real family with real problems. Iranian director, Asghar Farhadi, knows what he is doing and delivers a near perfect film. He captures a glimpse of an Iranian family and lets the camera tell the story. What at first seems like a movie that's going to focus on the separation between the husband and wife later becomes more complicated and interesting when the main character is charged for murder and we see the way the Iranian law system works. We also experience how the entire situation affects the different members of the family. I also liked the final reveal near the ending as I wasn't sure how the story was going to pay out, and it worked really well. Most foreign films tend to deal with social issues since these movies are cheaper to make and they don't count with the costly productions that Hollywood films have to create spectacular visual effects and action scenes. That is why more emphasize is put on the storytelling in order to capture the viewer's attention. The storytelling here is the center of the movie and we truly care for what the characters are going through. We can relate to these people despite their different culture and beliefs. They have to deal with similar issues that most families need to deal with, and that is what makes A Separation a universal movie.",_

31,12 April 2012,cultfilmfan,10, A Separation,"A Separation is a film from Iran in Persian with English subtitles. The film takes a look at two families through the course of the film and a situation that develops between them. This situation will ultimately test all of them and their families and watching each individual and trying to ultimately piece together as a viewer on whether who is telling the truth, or not is a large part of the film, but by doing so and as time goes by we get to learn more about the characters in the process as they also get to learn and see different sides of themselves that perhaps they did not know were there. A Separation was an emotionally gripping film that takes hold of your attention very early on already and takes us through quite an ordeal. We can see the pain and frustration the characters in both families are dealing with in this film and how a lot of what they are feeling must really be bottled up, or internalized inside of them because each of them has so much stress and confusion going on, that it is hard to imagine them not finally reaching a breaking point. When the conflict between the two families enters the film it is done in quite an ingenious way. As viewers we don't quite see everything, so in trying to make up in our own minds of who is in the right and who is in the wrong, the film never allows us to do that because it keeps bringing forth evidence from both sides. The way these families act and up to their conclusion about how to settle this feud is done in rather a brilliant way also. We have characters here who are very stubborn and want to get back to just living their lives normally as well as characters who are strapped financially, so they may have to decide which move will best suit them. My favourite aspect of all is the devoted part of one's religion and culture playing a large role here as well. With one character wanting to tell the truth, or even perhaps bend the truth a little bit, but unsure of what to do with the situation their family is in and also doing what is right according to their culture and religion. The story told in this film is a story that basically could be told in any country using any two families basically, but I found that the fact that the film is set in Iran, where they have a different way of life and beliefs than say the Western countries made this all the more fascinating. The fact that a families honour and one's devotion to their religion were very admirable qualities. Please do not take what I say out of context when I say that Iran is different from Western civilizations because I am not trying to be racist in the least when I say that. In fact the characters in this film have such a loyalty to their families, their culture, religion and way of life that I actually found it quite admirable and I don't think it would work as well, or translate as well had it been done and told in an American film. The acting in A Separation is all superb from the entire cast. I have never seen any of these actors in previous films, but they all do such incredible jobs with their characters that I hope I will see them in other films one day soon. The amazing script and direction by Asghar Farhadi is utterly compelling. Some may find this film a little tough to watch because of all the grief and heartache these two families are going through in their day to day lives, but for me it was more of an eye opener than anything else and I could really empathize and sympathize with both families with the situations that they were both in. I think that is one of the best things about the script and film. It allows us to feel and ultimately to care about the situation and what is going on in both these families, so no matter what the final verdict is of their outcome and dispute we really do want to see it ended, but at the same time we want both families to be okay and move on to bigger and hopefully better things in life. We are not biased against one or the other, but rather just made to understood their situations and why they behave the way they do and instead of getting angry over these choices they have made we just as an audience feel pity for them and wish that things had gone a different way and didn't have to be this way. The film from start to finish was absolutely compelling and made us care because of well written characters that made us be allowed to identify and care for them. By allowing us to do so, we can look at their situations differently rather than if we hadn't been introduced to them in this way and just flat out did not care. But the thing is we do care and the subject of honesty is brought to the table here and altogether this is a morality play that will have you talking about it long after you see it. This is an emotionally powerful film with superb performances, a captivating and well developed screenplay that involves the viewer on so many levels and we thank them for that. This certainly did deserve the Academy Award it received for Best Foreign Language Film. One of the best films of last year and a true masterpiece and triumph of cinema.",

But it certainly convinced me of its authenticity in terms of the problems faced by most ordinary people at lot of the time. I assume that the characters were played by actors, but they never seemed like actors and never intruded their own personalities into the piece.

I had one reservation - about an event hidden from the viewer but critical to an understanding of the action. However, apart from this, I thought it was excellent.",
35,8 January 2012,Andy-296,10, An extraordinary film,"I think most people have experienced in life at least once the law of unintended consequences, where a number of moves, seemingly small and harmless in themselves, end up in an explosive and desperate situation when they add up. In this wonderful Iranian drama (I WILL DISCLOSE SOME SPOILERS), Nader and Simin, a middle class, westernized couple in Tehran, are divorcing. Nader, the wife, wants to leave Iran for abroad with their daughter; Simin (an extraordinary performance by Peyman Moaadi) wants to stay to take care of his Alzheimer disease ravaged father. Nader moves out of the house, and to take care of his father, Simin hires Razieh, a religious, working class woman, who is clearly out of her depth in having to take care of an incontinent, senile man. In her second day at work, she leaves for a moment the apartment, leaving the father tied at the bed. Simin soon arrives and finds his father has fallen from bed and is unconscious. Razieh returns, Simin angrily confronts her, he accuses her of negligence in caring for his father and (it turns out falsely) of stealing money, they start arguing and he ends up shoving her from the apartment. She falls and ends up losing her four months pregnancy. When her unemployed husband Hodjat learns of this, he pushes charges of murder toward Simin, and soon there is a huge legal confrontation between the couples. I will not reveal more, but we are less than half ways into the movie, and in the course of the trial, many things would turn out not to be what we supposed at first.",
36,16 January 2012,silentman01,9, The Best Film of 2011,"2011 was especially bleak for films in general with the exception of a few. This film however towers over all the few bright lights that emerged and gave it a kick in the chest to bring to life of what has otherwise been a forgettable year. ""A Separation"" is a film which hails from Iran, a country which despite it's oppressive regime has always managed to surprise the world with a few film gems of it's own, and this might be the jewel in the crown. Directed by Asghar Farhadi, the film talks about love, bitterness, sorrow and happiness that befall a family during it's arduous times. In this case the tumultuous period is personified by the separation that the two main characters are going through. This is not because that they are not in love with each other anymore, but because their circumstances and their goals are far apart from each other to achieve any hope for reconciliation. The wife wants to leave for America because she believes that the move will bring hope to their daughter's life. The husband does not want to go because he has to care for his ailing father who is suffering from Alzheimer. Both the causes are noble and are for the things they deeply care about, but it is also tearing them apart and brings forth further predicaments to all characters within the film as it puts into perspective the lengths people will go to protect, not only their families, but also themselves.",
37,1 January 2012,cheryl_lsk,9," Masterful Acting, Directing, Storyline!!!","Wow, i haven't caught a show that's been more real and intense in years. The acting and directing for this film made me feel like i was watching a documentary. That in itself is laudable. As the story unfolds you the viewer is left to guess the plot and to second guess yourself as to who the protagonists or antagonists are in the film. The film manages to grasp and reflect human nature which is complex and multi-faceted. You'd be left guessing and predicting the plot while trying to understand the characters and the choices they make. The film also aids us in understanding the roles of religion and culture... and more into human characteristics that go beyond those.

We, the audience, are forced to serve as judges from beginning to end. (Please note the first scene in which we look at the couple talking to a judge.) Should we leave behind the father with Alzheimer's disease? Are there any circumstances in which lies are morally acceptable? Is it appropriate for parents to encourage their children to lie? Should a teacher shy away from telling the truth? Are there any problems when we behave purely in conformity with our religion? Has justice been done in Iran? As for the maid's miscarriage, whose fault is it? Herself because of her negligence? Her husband who owes people money? Her employer who allows a pregnant woman to work as a maid? ",

The movie starts with an argument for divorce between Simin (Leila Hatami) and Nader (Peyman Moaadi) before a judge in an Iranian court. Through their argument, the main storyline of the movie becomes clear for us so that we become aware that Nader and Simin have been planning to move to a European country to provide better opportunities, as Simin claims in the court, for their only daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi).",

Sometimes I end up enjoying these movies and sometimes I feel like I'd have had a better time watching the Three Stooges for an hour and a half. Five to ten minutes into A SEPARATION I was hoping Moe, Larry and Curley would enter, stage right. Then a surprise plot twist occurs and I became hooked. My interest aside it wasn't until the drive home that I realized what a magnificent take on Iranian life had been packaged into this film . The viewer gets the present impact of Iran's late 70's Islamic Revolution from as unbiased a point-of-view as is possible. Consider; e.g., that I was able to walk out of the theater contemplating some beneficial aspects of a society guided, in part, by theocratic principles. Instead of envisioning faithful Iranian Muslims as fanatical zealots in robes and burkas I instead understand them as not much different as American churchgoers' e.g., from the Moral Majority to my Catholic heritage. I want to avoid the superficial observation, ""canned"" superlative of saying, ""Golly gee, Iranians are just like me and you."" But you know something, Iranians are just like me and you.",
48,18 December 2012,Artimidor,9, Fatherland or motherland - a decision,"Iranian director Asghar Farhadi's ""A Separation"" is a truly remarkable film. It's more than a picture about two people who want to leave each other, rather it deals with many things that divide people, which isn't necessarily a bad thing per se - but what divides entails ramifications for either side. On the forefront of course there's the titular dispute between Nader and Simin, two Iranians. Undoubtedly they love each other, but are filing for divorce - Simin intends to leave the country with her daughter Termeh for the sake of Termeh's future, but Nader wants to stay in Iran taking care of his father, who suffers from Alzheimer. While his father doesn't recognize him, his son still does. But is the illness of the father only a pretext for Nader?",

56,11 February 2012,georgep53,10," ""A Separation"" - Great Achievement Of Iranian Cinema","Iran's Foreign Language Oscar nominee ""A Separation"" is a masterpiece of cinema verite. It possesses a wonderful ""Rashomon""-like quality in which a group of people search for truth amidst a maze of religious veracity, class differences, legalities, family honor and self-interest. In the process Director/Writer Asghar Farhadi does a brilliant job of exposing the issues confronting Iran today without resorting to a political diatribe. His camera doesn't judge it just records everything from the necessity to conform to the whims of petty bureaucrats to the way people are willing to compromise their beliefs when it's expedient to do so. The cast is uniformly great. Leila Hatami is superb as Simin, the disaffected wife who separates from her husband because she wishes to emigrate for the sake of her daughter. Peyman Moaadi is the picture of middle class rectitude as Nader, the husband who insists on remaining in the country because he cannot abandon his Alzheimer's afflicted father. Sareh Bayat is great in the role of Razieh, a deeply religious but desperately poor woman who agrees to care for Nader's father when he's away at work. Shahab Hosseini is Houjat, Razieh's unemployed husband who will be going to prison unless he can obtain some cash to pay off his creditors. Sarina Farhadi is Termeh, the young idealistic daughter of Nader and Simin. Termeh is torn between her father's allegiance to the past and her mother's willingness to break free and seek a new life and isn't that the question facing Iran today.

It's what makes us human, flaws, warts and all, that A Separation transcends beyond its celluloid shelf life, and lives on, way past its closing credits, putting up a mirror in front of ourselves, that we see similar values and intrinsic human behaviour that transcends country, language and race, to show how basic and common we humans behave no matter where we are.",

Like the film's layered characters and ambiguous motives, it is perhaps difficult to articulate why. Perhaps its the twists are turns that deliver visceral emotional blows; in any culture, any language. Arguably, it combines superlative acting, writing and directing all seamlessly. The events are presented almost like court proceedings that mirror the film so you can make up your own mind about which character to side with, which actions are heroic and those which are deplorable. This is art portraying real life, a culture most of us are foreign to but the human needs are the same, life is grueling and ambiguous. What makes it fascinating is how the characters react, what would you do, do you agree? You are asked to be the jurors of the drama on screen. This is a devastating slow-burn of a drama, one in which the audience must participate. It's intelligent drama, but morally complex and opaque, and brilliant because of it.",

72,14 November 2014,brchthethird,9, Morally complex and gripping,"This is my first film from the Middle East (Iran, specifically), and I am amazed at the dramatic complexity and commitment to realism that Asghar Farhadi created in A SEPARATION. The story concerns a couple who divorces when the mother wants to leave Iran, but the father decides to stay behind with his Alzheimer's-suffering father. What follows is a compelling drama about divorce and its effect on the people involved, even how it can reach beyond the immediate family. There are many other complex issues discussed, and all of it is through the lens of Muslim culture, which I found fascinating. Thematically, the central issue is about making tough decisions in the context of a culture where religion and government are so intertwined. As far as acting is concerned, it was some of the best I've ever seen. Every performer gave their all, and it felt like I was watching a documentary with real people. This tone was also reinforced by the hand-held camera-work and (until the closing credits) a lack of music. Overall, this is not just one of the best foreign films I've ever seen, but one of the best period. The only minor issue I take is the rather ambiguous ending, but after watching the problems that the characters go through for two hours, it's probably just my personal desire for a more clear-cut resolution.

76,29 January 2012,zetes,8," Good, very good, even, but I don't see the greatness that everyone else apparently does","I'm having a hard time reviewing this film. I just can't help weighing my reaction to films against the consensus. It seems shallow, because, the thing is, I found this to be a very good film, but, compared to the general reaction, I found it merely that and not ""OMG BEST MOVIE EVERRRR!!!!"" The film is quite complex. Nader (Peyman Moadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) have reached an impasse in their marriage. She wants to leave the country with her daughter, but Nader cannot consider it at this point, because he's taking care of his disabled, Alzheimer's suffering father. After Simin leaves Nader, he must find someone to take care of his father while he is at work and his daughter is at school. Having little money with which to hire someone, he hits upon a desperate, pregnant woman, Razieh (Sareh Bayat), whose husband, Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini), is unemployed. Hodjat is the one Nader wants to take care of his father (Razieh is, for religious reasons, not allowed to physically engage the old man when he needs to use the bathroom or whatever), but Razieh must do it for the first few days. Unfortunately, she's unable to handle to huge responsibilities that come with the job, and she quickly runs into some horrible troubles. Those horrible troubles lead to other horrible troubles, and soon she and her husband are in court suing Nader, with Nader counter-suing them. In some ways, the film plays like a really good episode of Iranian Law & Order. That's definitely of great interest, because Iranian courts are quite different than our own (some may say more corrupt, but, honestly, probably not by much; I think a lot of this situation would play identically if it happened in the United States). While the issues presented are quite interesting, and the moral and class issues are entertaining to contemplate, I had some fundamental problems with the story. First, no matter which way you slice it, Simin comes off as a terrible human being. Nader would have agreed to leave with her and their daughter if he hadn't been forced to take care of his father. Presumably, if Simin was still with Nader, she'd be the one caring for the old man. Now, we all know how much that would suck, but Simin really couldn't help take care of the father for a year or two until he passed? Instead, she dumps the entire crappy situation on her husband (and daughter, whom she wants to steal away, too) to deal with on his own. The film never provides Simin with a realistic reason for making this decision, instead treating her like she's being reasonable, just because the director wants to seem unbiased. And then there's the whole issue of the lower class Razieh and Hodjat. Without spoiling the story, I must say, I was always entirely on Nader's side for the whole court case. Sure, he made some poor decisions, but the accusations against him are fairly unjust. The film gives him some baggage when he lies about a key element of the story, but, really, the lies seem pretty minor compared to the other side's lies. It's all very intriguing, but, I must ask, where is this ""BEST FILM EVER!"" stuff coming from? It's very blandly filmed in a hand-held documentary style, with maybe only one or two good shots and edits. The performances are pretty good, especially Peyman Moadi. All in all, though, good, but nothing revolutionary.",

Farhadi is highly respected Iranian filmmaker who has in the past ten years gathered over 20 international awards and was this year ranked among Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world. A Separation is the story of an ordinary Iranian family. Mother (Simin) believes that it is better for the life of their daughter to leave Iran and move to the west, while the father (Nader) wants to stay in Iran and take care of his sick father. Conflict leads to the separation of Simin and Nader. Then father's new guardian steps into the story. She accuses Nader for a physical attack in which she lost a child. Although story is seemingly very simple, screenplay is definitely one of the best in recent times. Deep, complex, with great characters that are hard to forget and with authentic depiction of lately demonized Iran. Although a good portion of the cast is relatively amateurish, except Leila Hatami (Simin) and Shahab Hossein (guardian's husband), acting is flawless. The technical part is just as we expect form Farhadi, almost no complaints. One of complaints that goes to technical part is unuse of music, but although some scenes would made better impression no one can say that Farhadi's movies aren't great just as they are. Special strong scenes are the ones from courtroom, starting from the first scene of dialogue between Simin and Nader with the judge which lasts for more than three and a half minutes and which immediately announces way of filming that is only possible with perfect acting. Characters that look so realistically is almost impossible to find. Brilliant movie that is definitely one of the best of 2011.",

They all argue – and they go to see the judge – which is incidentally like Grand Central Station.,
92,16 January 2012,s-arasteh,10," Shredding!! multilateral in metaphors, prevaricate in portraying life...","Where there is limitation, lurks beauty and art. This best justifies why ""A Separation"" engulfs the viewer to contemplate on more than meets the eye on screen. In a cinema (Iran), which barely leaves any room to openly debate, or perhaps pitch into beliefs and disbelieves, this gem ingeniously sneaks out from dilemmas involved in matrimony state of a couple, depreciated and devastated enough to take refuge in a separation. ""A Separation"" is about inability of judiciary system when it comes to moral phenomenons, while ironically implies on corrupted legal systems and its vicious regression. We are being asked by many complicated questions during the entire movie. A predicament where an immaculate child is condemned to confess what is not ethically right, nor is true, just in order to sustain the union of her semi-disjointed family viable. Farhadi masters the story while developing it in such a way which incapacitates the viewer to make unequivocal and straightforward judgments by asking labyrinth-like questions within a situation where all of us could have been through. Last but not least, through the entire movie the viewer is somehow being interrogated about the inevitable intersection of religion, faith and beliefs.",

97,17 October 2012,oanaioan,10, a masterpiece,"Watching this wonderfully simple and subtle film I realized that cinema as an art is alive and well in the world and all you need is to know where to look for it. It is the story of a couple,Nader and Simin, who want a divorce. They do not hate each other, they just want different things from life, amongst them, the most important one : where to raise their daughter.Simin wants to emigrate, probably to the West(we find out at the end that she is an English teacher)whereas Nader wants to stay in Iran and care for his ailing father. The facts are simple enough and the film takes on the task to peel this onion and show us the layers of the story. Nader is an intransigent and moral human being who doesn't want to leave his father and his country(the Alzheimer stricken father is such a symbol for a country that lost its way and identity). He cant't relinquish the past in order to build the future(the daughter,)he wants to reconcile them. Simin, on the other hand is portrayed as more materialistic( she counts the money)and superficial(she wants to leave everything behind and start anew. In the end Nader is forced to realize that he doesn't live in a Greek tragedy,that life is full of compromise,that you need the support of the others that truth is not absolute and being a hero seems impossible in the modern world. Simin, on the other hand reveals her humanity, her love of her husband and daughter but she ignores Razeh's plea,either from selfishness or disdain for her superstitious type of religion. The child is the one to chose in the end what kind of future to have, what country to live in, what kind of human being she wants to be.Whichever way she goes I feel that she understands better than her parents that we,human beings,have to struggle to remain pure but cannot do so at the expense of our compassion and humanity.",
98,20 May 2012,DevikaSethi,9," Of many, many shades of grey...","A great film does not require special effects. It does not require a suspenseful plot, action scenes,famous faces,dramatic twists and turns and an unexpected ending. A Separation is a triumph of the art of storytelling over the glitz and gloss of these other elements that are so much easier to find in today's films. The film is not for children, but it is about children, and about children who grow up into people who look like adults, but whose conflicts are enlarged versions of playground scuffles, but with much more serious consequences. A couple decides to separate, and there is a child involved, as well as an ill parent. How formulaic this could have been. But Farhadi has created, with these basic elements, a narrative of such power and meaning that it carries the viewer with him. It is impossible to remain detached while watching this film, which is as much a commentary on class and gender in modern-day Iran as it is on the power (and spaces outside) of the state, and on changing dynamics in modern families. Simin, the wife who wants to leave Iran, never spells out clearly her reasons for wanting to do so; her claustrophobia is implied, and her husband is not the major cause. Simin has choices of which Razieh, the maid, cannot dream. Yet, Razieh for all her troubles, is less troubled that Simin. Nader, played brilliantly by Payam Moadi, is clearly a good man, but his actions are questionable at times. This a film about the human condition, its dilemmas and conflicts; it is not about resolution of these, but rather about the impossibility of resolution.",

Being from Iran, this is interesting enough as an insight into the surprisingly modern world of that country. But this subtly develops into so much more and although all appears to happen before our very eyes, all it seems, is not what it seems. The central performances are amazingly affective and it is almost as if we were a fly on wall and as for everyone around the main characters are as if part of a documentary. It reminded me of some of Ingmar Bergman's work in that the drama seems to come out of the very people we are watching and we find ourselves struggling to get a firm grip on what is truly going on and what has really happened.

I was struck by how similar the issues are in some ways to those of a British couple facing separation, yet also by the extent of the cultural differences. The wife wants to leave the country with her daughter, but her husband has the power to forbid it. The perceptive teenage daughter is caught between her parents, and chooses at first to stay with her father in a desperate attempt to keep her parents together. The wife goes off to live with her own parents, leaving her estranged husband with the problem of how to obtain day care for his father, who suffers from dementia. The woman who is hired for this task through a casual arrangement proves unable to cope. There is a fascinating scene in which, concerned for the old man who is incontinent, she phones an imam for advice as to whether it is permissible for her to help her charge to clean himself. The husband returns home to find the flat empty and his father in a state, and matters turn violent when the carer comes back without a good explanation.

The story is believable and easy to understand because the characters and situations are something that each one of us have experienced or witnessed sometime in our lives. The actors even the little girl are marvelous, you can feel their emotions and understand their motives every second of the movie and the editing is just superb.

Simin (Leila Hatami) and Nader (Peyman Moaadi) are a middle-class couple fighting over the future of their daughter, Termeh: Simin wants to take her overseas so the girl will not have to grow up in a misogynistic theocracy but Nader can't leave his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), who is in an advanced stage of Alzheimer's disease, behind and Termeh won't leave without Dad. Simin files for divorce and leaves Nader and Termeh to care for the elderly man but Nader also has to work so on Simin's recommendation he hires Razieh (Sareh Bayat), a young working-class woman, to look after Grandpa. The work of looking after Nader's dad is too much for the pregnant Razieh who also has a small girl, Somayeh, in tow and so a series of mishaps occurs which escalate into confrontations that have the effect of straining Simin and Nader's fragile marriage further and roping in other innocent parties such as Termeh's tutor, various neighbours and Razieh and her husband Hojjat's relatives and his creditors. Along the way, Termeh, perhaps the wisest and sanest person in the film, learns a hard lesson about moral ambiguity, the class divide between herself and Somayeh, the oppressive role that religion is made to play in Iranian society, and how living in Iran with all its restrictions simply grinds good people like her parents, Razieh and others into situations where they abase themselves and one another.",

As the film crawls closer and closer to the conclusion, you're literally at the edge of your seat as new evidence are introduced, as the family is struggling with the court room situation and their own situation, and as we come to finding out the secrets everyone is trying to hide from the court. There's no way to describe how intriguing this film is, and even in the last seconds of the film, you're still at the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. Undeniably a Oscar worthy film, the Iraqians have proved that the U.S. is not alone in the film industry. I'm hoping to see more films like this: intense, stressful, and emotional, minus all the sex, violence, substance use, and profanity.

A simple act of anger in pushing a pregnant woman out of the apartment becomes the trigger for a complex and multi-layered investigation into uncovering the truth. The judge must navigate this heated affair and dish out justice. They retrace their steps and return to scene of the crime, recreating the accusation of manslaughter like an Auguste Dupin or a Sherlock Holmes. Termeh, perhaps one of the only impartial observers of these events, conducts her own investigations, questioning her father until he buckles under those unblinking innocent eyes and admits to knowing that Razieh was pregnant. But he insists that this was not on his mind in the act, and we believe him, and that the law is unequipped to handle such emotional intricacies. So Termeh must lie, and in that silent, tear streaked face, we are told much more than a line of dialogue could ever do. The subtext shines through, as her impartiality is marred. ",

A Separation is as good as an emotional drama and as nail biting thriller. The story, screenplay and characterization are masterpiece in itself. There are very few movies which surprises you with their honesty and purity. A SEPARATION is a compelling drama about the dissolution of a marriage. Simin wants to leave Iran with her husband Nader and daughter Termeh. Simin sues for divorce when Nader refuses to leave behind his Alzheimer-suffering father. Her request having failed, Simin returns to her parents' home, but Termeh decides to stay with Nader. When Nader hires a young woman to assist with his father in his wife's absence, he hopes that his life will return to a normal state. However, when he discovers that the new maid has been lying to him, he realizes that there is more on the line than just his marriage.

140,25 February 2012,meeza,8, I am feeling SEPARATED!,"And I ran, I ran so far away, I just ran, I ran all night & day, I couldn't get away Sorry to get all ""Flock of Seagulls"" on you in the beginning of my film review of the Iranian foreign film ""A Separation"", but I had to since there will be a flock of puns in this review as there normally are in all my movie reviews. ""A Separation"" has received mucho critical acclaim and even received Best Foreign Language Film and Best Original Screenplay Oscar nominations. I thought the movie was very well-crafted by Writer-Director Asghar Farhadi and was very deserving of its Best Foreign Language Oscar nomination, but I would not separate ""A Separation"" as one of the best screenplays of the year; so yea, I do not think it was worthy of its Best Original Screenplay nomination. Hey ""A Separation"" lovers- before you separate from my review, please let me explain why. Before I do that, I have to do the ""explain the movie plot thing"" in my review. ""A Separation"" is primarily about Nader and Simin, an Iranian couple on the verge of a separation (ya, that is the title of the movie) because Simin says that she wants to flee from Iran to a better land, and Nader does not want to join his cousin Ralph Nader in America and therefore wants to stay put in Iran to take care of his ailing father. Due to the separation, Nader hires the deeply-religious Razieh to take care of his father. An argument between Nader and Razier on the caring of the father turns ""A Separation"" into a tailspin of turmoil for the characters involved. Director Asghar Farhadi directs this downward spiral with cerebral supremacy an authenticity; I did enjoy Farhadi's direction far more than his screenplay, which was solid but not of Oscar nomination material due to its basic verbal exchange between the film's characters. Peyman Maadi and Leila Hatami excelled with their starring performances as Nader and Simin. And teen actress Sarina Farhadi was astounding as their teenage daughter Termeh, who does not want to be the Termehnator of her parent's marriage. I am going to give you the good fortune of a separation from my puns as I end this review, but please do not separate yourself from ""A Separation"" viewing. **** Good",

148,17 December 2011,arya_zangi,9, The Last Of Farhadi's Trilogy,"A Separation is the Asghar Farhadi's last movie from the trilogy: Fireworks Wednesday, About Elly and A Separation. All these movies have the same themes: Love, Family, Truth; and these themes are displayed through a social and ethical platform. Directing, Writing and Actings of the movie are flawless and perfect and it deserves all the prizes it's winning. Farhadi's Fireworks Wednesday is an easier film to understand: within the movie you struggle to find the truth and in the end everything's clear, somehow nothing to doubt. About Elly, the second movie in trilogy is more complicated: it's hard to find out the truth, relationships in families are more complex and the movie ends with almost an open ending and many answers to questions in viewer's mind remain unknown. A Separation, which has more powerful ethical and social context, is the most complicated and mind-involving one. After watching the whole movie even several times, it's almost impossible to blame anyone and it's Farhadi's goal to create not easy to judge characters, just like the real world. What is the truth? What is happening through Nader and Simin's minds that leads them to divorce? What if Simin is right about Nader's changed emotions? These questions are still with me when I think about A Separation. But if you haven't seen the film, don't hesitate; just enjoy perfection of Farhadi's work.",

I had the pleasure of watching it on DVD (unfortunately I missed it when it was on big screen) and I couldn't believe that it was just a movie and the characters weren't real or they were just acting! Actually, I have to say that they weren't acting, they were living their roles in front of the camera. All of the cast from the little girl to the ill old man, they were real to me as my family members are. As the movie was approaching to the ending minutes I was just wishing that it didn't end.

In fact, it does fascinate but disturbs also. Seeing all these submissive women wearing the chador, even in their own home, is very disturbing. These women asking for spiritual guidance from Islamic law is revolting to anyone who cannot imagine a society where equality of the sexes is absent.

Basically middle class Iranian couple Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) are on the verge of divorce, despite still loving each other somewhat Simin has exit visa valid for only forty days and he wants to move for a better life with ten year old daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), but Nader will not leave his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) who suffering Alzheimer's disease, despite him not knowing who he is most of the time. Simin eventually moves out and goes to live with her parents, Termeh stays with her father in an action to try and bring her per divorcing parents back together, and he meanwhile follows advice from Simin hires a man called Hojjat (Shahab Hosseini) to be his father's carer while during the day he is at work, but Hojjat can't make it on the first day. Instead Hojjat's wife Razieh (Sareh Bayat) is desperate for the money, being mother to infant daughter Somayeh (Kimia Hosseini), and shows up to do the work, a few days pass and she continues in her husband's continued absence, and between her and Nader an incident occurs that could threaten their place in the community. Eventually all adults and children make their decisions as what is the best thing to do for themselves, of course the decisions bring justice, humanity and well-being into consideration as well, the poignant end of the film is the divorce between Nader and Simin being finalised, and Termeh is left alone to decide which parent she wants to live, the parents waiting in the character lasts through the end credits. Also starring Shirin Yazdanbakhsh as Simin's Mother, Kimia Hosseini as Somayeh and Merila Zare'i as Miss Ghahraii. The performances are all fine, I admit I lost my way a little with what was going on between particular characters, but overall I got the gist of the story, it is an interesting take on a domestic situation and how all facets of it will change and affect others in the mix, a watchable drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.

Just read that simple set up and watch it. A Separation will knock you off your feet. It looks like just another marriage drama. It is so much more than that. The film is slightly slow paced at first, but once it gets going it doesn't pause for breath. Despite being a simple story with no big shocks, no massive emotional breakdowns, no explosions and a story which stays entirely grounded in the real world, it's more intense than most action films and more compelling than any Summer Blockbuster. The film is realistic and everything feels like it could happen, and this is enhanced by the excellent direction. The strength of the direction is that it's completely invisible and its devastating effects hit the audience with brilliant subtlety.

Mr Kalari (movie's Director of Photography) has an extremely important role (which may be neglected) in this film; His pictures are very real and generally have a fast tempo that corresponds to actors' acting. But one of the few faults of this movie in my view is insignificant role of music , although it (lack of music power) can not be felt easily and director have filled the gap with good dialogues and excellent acting.

Razieh is equally burdened by her pregnancy and the need to earn money following her husband's redundancy, while her incredibly devout religious beliefs only seem to make things more difficult.

187,26 September 2014,FilmCriticLalitRao,8, This film by Iranian director Asghar Farhadi would generate different interpretations from different viewers.,"With the massive availability of entertainment at the click of a mouse, all national cinemas need to innovate in order to stay in the race as the competition to produce 'excellent films' is becoming tougher day by day. This is also true about many Asian cinemas which have hitherto relied heavily on exotic elements in order to win awards at film festivals as well as viewers in cinemas. At this juncture, it is a positive news that Iranian cinema has moved from its ubiquitous depiction of children. This is a constructive development for those who closely monitor its development as there are other better stories to be told than producing feature films about the lives of cute little ones. After watching the initial five minutes of ""A Separation"" nobody would fail to understand the reason why a large part of Western world got interested in it. For a vast majority, it clicked as it has 'divorce' as its main focus. However, the film doesn't waste any time to change its principal focus to concentrate more on mistakes made by two protagonists : a man who cares more about his father and his independent wife who has her own beliefs. What is important to note is that both the parties are equally right about issues related to modernity and tradition. The film presents a primordial ethical dilemma : What to choose, How to choose and Why to choose ? More and more Asian societies are confronted with dilemma of this kind because as small children, it is extremely difficult to take proper care of old people. As a screen writer, director Asghar Farhadi has superb imagination as there are various twists and turns in the story but his film is dotted with moments where minor yet crucial things don't seem to fit well. Like all films, ""A Separation"" too has its fair share of glaring inconsistencies : How can a young girl child have the kind of maturity which one expects from grown up children especially in her manner of answering questions and putting questions ? How can a physically feeble old man suffering from Alzheimer's disease have the ability to go out all alone on a busy street ? Apart from these minor glitches, there are some scenes where deliberate padding is equally evident which somewhat lessens the seriousness of this film. For example : The adolescent girl reading a passage about class differences in Iranian society. Although the film is replete with 'dénouements', one better than the other, the film doesn't have any other ""wow factor"". Nevertheless, it succeeds in winning numerous hearts due to its humane subject matter. As a film is the subjective affair of viewers, it can be rightly said that generalizations wouldn't work in the case of his film as all people have the right to behave in the manner which suits their personalities. In hindsight, this film is a grim reminder of all the family issues which the Western world seems to have forgotten. It doesn't shy away in presenting its philosophical underpinnings. It is as if all the 'ifs' and 'buts' of ordinary people's mundane lives have been rolled in a single story to deal with ethical issues which director Asghar Farhadi valiantly attempts to tackle. On a lighter note, if a humorous ""Making Of"" is appended to end credits, there is all possibility of seeing everybody involved in the production of this film especially actors laughing with joy over the phenomenal success achieved by this film. Finally, no review will do justice to this film if one doesn't mention the plight of two innocent, little girls who have to suffer a lot in this film due to their parents' capricious as well as irresponsible behavior. May the children never suffer anywhere in the world !!!!",

191,11 October 2020,Horst_In_Translation,6, How it all went wrong,"""Jodaeiye Nader az Simin"" is an Iranian movie from 2011, so these slightly over two hours will have their 10th anniversary next year already. How time flies! And probably it happened already depending on when you read this review. Feels like yesterday that this came out. The writer and director here is of course Asghar Farhadi, who launched his career back at the end of the 20th century and has turned into one of the most renowned filmmakers from his country now. Many immediately think of Jafar Panahi when it comes to Iran, but well Farhadi, who will soon turn 50, managed the impressive achievement that two of his films won the Best Foreign Language Oscar and that is really something to be proud of, no matter if you care about awards or not. This one here was the film that did so first and I think it is also better-received than the second, but yeah, only because this one here got an extremely good reception and ""The Salesman"" ""only"" got a strong recepption you could say. But we talked about that one on another occasion I think, so now let's focus on this one here. The English title ""A Separation"" is much easier to remember by the way and does not include the names like the original Iranian title. Although it may be a bit misleading because, aside from the male being named first, you could think that these two are equals in this film. The poster here implies the same. Well, it is certainly not the case because the male lead has far more screen time and is without a doubt the only lead performance in this film. There is also at least one other female character who has as much screen time and probably even more significance than the (ex-)wife character. Maybe it was Leila Hatami's memorable red hair in here that put more emphasis on her. The male lead is Payman Maadi. Sorry for not going much into detail about these two and barely mentioning their names even, but I cannot say at all that I am familiar with Iranian cinema and what they have done before and after this film. Just check out the cast list for that. And their bodies of work if you care. As for Farhadi, his successes in Iran also resulted in an international breakthrough and he got to work with the like of Bérénice Bejo or also more recently the Oscar-winning couple Javier Bardem and Penélope Cruz. Never realized how close her name is to Bejo's, in terms of letter amount and accents too, even if she has only in her first name. But they are also almost the same age. Okay. Now really back to this film, let's not get drifted away here. Obviously it's in Iranian, which means you will need subtitles if you want to enjoy the whole thing. I mean it is really unusual to see a film from this part of the world so high in the imdb top250, almost inside the top100 even, and also, probably partially as a consequence, have over 200k ratings on the most western of all movie website. Is it justified? Maybe not. It is a good film and certainly closer to the attribute ""great"" than to the attribute ""mediocre"" or even ""weak"", but still a bit on the overrated site. As you can see from my rating. Nonetheless I do not bear a grudge or anything. There are worse films out there having received the same degree of accolades and recognition.",
192,16 February 2014,sergepesic,9, A Slice of Humanity,"It is very easy to look at this unruly planet of ours as a place of many exotic different cultures. And it certainly is, at least at first sight. But people are people and their troubles and heartaches might seem surprisingly familiar no matter where they come from. Iran with it's fundamentalist approach to Islam, definitely seems a mind-boggling place for a Westerner, but in spite of hijabs, chadors and religious beards, there is so much more than that. Intellectual couple torn by the duty towards a child and a senile parent, and another struggling, in debt couple who's last resort seems to be drowning in the boiling cauldron of showy piety. And with them and next to them just people trying to live normal life in less than normal circumstances. The same could apply to many countries, including ours, but this movie shows this single story with focused, almost brutal calm. When it all ends with the final separation, the viewer feels that gentle throb in his chest, the one that makes eyes misty. A slice of humanity.",

In this film, we do not see any joy or hope in the film from the last 5 minutes to the end. The whole movie is black and sad, not even the ending is happy.

196,5 April 2011,mamadklashinkov,10, Ambient Spotlight,"""I've lost everything -- and you're scaring me of a sentence? Fear God!"" This line appears to be taken out of an ancient anecdote, but it's taken from this very movie. A masterpiece, a bitter drama, comparable to Hollywood dramas. It's shot like a documentary, and focuses on a ""very recent"" issue, according to the director: Divorce. Although divorce is not a ""recent"" thing, it was a taboo and stigmatic not many years ago, not only in Iran, but almost in every country. These days divorce is something that happened at least to one person you're closely related too. Some people, especially divorce attorneys, make thousands out of it. ""Post-divorce drama"" is a newly-coined term, cured by a weekend in Thailand or drinking to death -- it's not the only ""trauma"" that comes with divorce. Divorce is a change of lifestyle, and a very bad change, and this movie is trying to depict what might happen if someone can't overcome it -- divorce may significantly affect other people's lives too. For that matter, everyone can empathize with this movie, no matter where he's been bred or what he has been taught. And that's the beauty of this movie.",
197,1 February 2012,blackrose1109,7, Refreshing original Cinema,"I believe one of the main causes that make us award the so called ""Foreign movie"" is their fresh cultural perspective of life that it adds to the cinema heritage. we can't but appreciate and honor those who present us this great gift to cinema combining it with artistic achievement. and that was the case with Fahradi and his (A Separation). the Iranian cinema is well known of it's excellent cinema, even though it could be regarded globally as not popular, but I believe that the effort made such as the one in ""a separation"" shades a lot of light to this original cinema. A separation is an original movie, I guess that at less is a fact beyond discussion. It's simply had every thing a good movie can present; it's engaging, vivid, well written, and had a marvelous acting cast and screenplay.. the movie is a social drama prospect, a movie that forges out questions more than answers, and even though it puts the audience form the first scene in the judge chair,I don't believe that was to ask for our presumption or judgment, rather it seeks to have us only as a witnesses. As audience we are in a very difficult position in this case, for the fact that we witness a very complicated case of constant dispute between the couples Simin and Nadar over their daughter, and then it got more complicated when another couple shows up and accuse Nadar to be the cause of the wife apportion. I should admit that, the intensity of the movie may bather me a little bit, because it keeps the one intense all through the movie, in fact we may notice that the movies scenario is built mainly on these disputing dialogs. Yet, there's so much things fascinated me as well, the things that attracts me the most was first of all is the screenplay; the camera shouts are very intentional and expressive,the acting is superb, thank god not over reacted nether cold and flat, a thing even great movies slip in sometimes. the writing and scenario deserve no doubt an award, because event thought the story is basically simple and linear, the movie's threads are well compose, so it may keep the ones breath on hold to the last minuet of the play. No doubt Fahradi presents a very committed serious cinema, and the best testimony of this fact is its frequent understatement such as ""-I'd prefer that my child do not grow up under these circumstances, as a mother I has this right -under what conditions? what conditions ma'am??"" the work as a whole implies a lot of figurative elements, and could bears a lot of different interpretations. at last I guess I have to say something about the thematic point of the work, as a social drama, the movie presents two ways of life that we might lead and leaves to us and Terma (the daughter) to chose between them, which are; ""N- she had to stay to learn! S- to learn about what stubbornness and confrontations! N- No, so she could learn not to be cowered like u!!"" what dazzle me the most in these dialogs is it's strikingly honesty. the ending of the movie leave the parents at the door of the court room waiting to know the decision of their daughter of which of them she will chose to live with... who would you think she'll chose? what would' you chose?",
198,30 January 2015,avik-basu1889,10, Cinema doesn't get more realistic than this !!!!!,"I think it will be slightly unfair to call A Separation just a film. This for me was more than a film, it was an experience. The film is littered with moments where the line dividing fiction and reality in the minds of the viewers get completely dissolved. Any one of us can be involved in the situations that the characters in the movie have to deal with. Any one of us can picture ourselves in the shoes of any of the characters. The director Asghar Farhadi excels in making us a part of their lives and putting us firmly in the middle of the struggles and dilemmas that the characters go through and compels us to mentally imagine what we would have done in a similar situation.

The two men in this film are stubborn idiots at times, but one patiently helps and stands by his father who has Alzheimer's, and the other speaks the truth about people jumping to conclusions about people of the lower class. All of these characters are nuanced and imperfect, and their authenticity is one of the wonderful things about this thought-provoking film. It's also an interesting window into Iran's legal process, and the search for truth and justice. I loved the humanism on display - the thoughtful deference to others, courtesies, and attempts at conciliation - while at the same time, how emotions boil over, people lie, and there are no easy answers. The fleeting look the two young girls exchange towards the end says it all, and it's devastating. My thanks to Letterboxd user Muffintree for suggesting this film!",

The script and pacing are just about perfect: The tension builds and complications mount just long enough, then everything's resolved with the brilliant simplicity of a folktale. Sharp, sensitive performances; provides a fascinating perspective on the sharia-based Iranian legal system and the role that religion plays in everyday life. (Good to know that in Tehran there's an Islamic hotline you can call if, say, you're a pious home attendant taking care of an old guy who's peed his pants and you want to know if it would be in accordance with Islamic law for you to change him.)

206,5 November 2021,neuron2003,10," An intense, riveting portrayal of a family in crisis","The wife (Simin) in an otherwise loving marriage wants to emigrate out of Iran with their 11yo daughter (Termeh) to offer her more opportunities. Her husband, Nader, cannot bring himself to leave his father, who has Alzheimer's disease and is being cared for by the family. Simin seeks a divorce and appears before a magistrate/""interrogator"" who denies her request and encourages her to stay and try to work out the problems. Instead, she leaves (temporarily?). Nader tries one caretaker who doesn't work out, and then hires a woman (Razeh) who needs the money for her own marriage but is hampered by her Islamic orthodoxy (e.g., helping the father change after being incontinent, let alone being in the apartment with him absent male supervision) and hampered by other initially vague problems. Razeh's husband is upset about this arrangement, but needs the income to keep him from prison after being pursued by debtors. I'll stop here for the sake of not revealing spoilers that should be experienced in viewing this remarkable film. As all have noted, the acting is superb at an Academy Award level- what struck me the most was the 11yo girl's ability to show a range of emotions from tween hostility/angst to deep despair. The two men, who end up antagonists, barely keep their anger at bay, and the actors convey their emotions in vivid intensity. The director, Asghar Farhadi, uses a hand-held camera, and frames so many scenes in a manner that accentuates the tension (e.g., a shot will continue lingering on a character without other action as they process the emotions that had just been evoked). Adding to the tension is the lack of a soundtrack, which Farhadi uses in other films.",
207,10 December 2013,paul2001sw-1,9, Pride and perjury,"Ashgar Farhadi makes the most beguiling films, grounded in the every day, heavy in dialogue, yet utterly compelling. 'A Separation' begins in the divorce courts; becomes a film more about the difficulties of being a single parent and carer than about the failing of a relationship; then returns to the courts in an unexpected way. The story is universal, yet grounded in the reality of Iranian life, and the notions of Islamic justice. The central (father) figure is a quiet and superficially reasonable man, but utterly proud and self-contained; his wife, who originally appears less sympathetic, actually possesses the social skills to (possibly) save their situation: the gradual transfer of sympathy evoked is one of the film's achievements. The film's second couple, who would be the villains in a Hollywood movie, are sympathetic in their own way even as they become locked in a fierce struggle with the nominal heroes.

Another remarking fact is that I could not force my self to take sides, for Nader or Razieh who lost her child, even though we get some truths such as Razieh's confession or Termeh's intuitive thinking.

Simin wants to go abroad, but Nader feels himself unable to follow as he has to look after his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), who has Alzheimer's. Daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) stays with Nader, but still wants her parents to be together. Nader hires Razieh to come and look after his house while he (Nader) is out at work, but things do not go according to plan. Razieh loses her unborn child, and her husband Hojjat (Shahab Hosseini) accuses Nader of contributing to the tragedy. The conflicts between the two families - those of Nader and Hojjat - end up in the courts, involving issues not just of justice but religious and social traditions as well. Asghar Farhadi's film is shot in documentary- style, with no musical accompaniment. Its structure can be described as elliptical; the end mirrors the beginning, depicting the difficulties of family life in a society where women have to act according to certain prescribed social and moral guidelines, while their male partners often allow belief in tradition to influence their judgment. Such attitudes are not peculiar to Farhadi's context; they prevail in other territories as well. A SEPARATION is a study in non-communication: both families are articulate, and can express their feelings through well-crafted dialog, but they do not listen to one another. The action unfolds with passionate intensity, sustaining the viewer's attention throughout.",

The plot bais is very simple. In modern Iran a wife wants to go abroad for proffessional motives and wants her husband to go with her. He doesn't want to go because he must stay to take care of his father who has got Alzheimer disease. The wife then asks for a divorce in court and leaves to stay with her parents. They have a young daughter for whom this situation becomes a psychological problem. The husband must hire a woman to take permanent care of his father. The situation however gets too complicated by mutual accusations: the man accusing her of having abandoned his father for some time at a given moment and he fell to the ground when alone and hurt himself and also of having stolen money from there; the woman accuses him of having pushed her out of the house which made her to fall on the stairs and suffer an abortion since she was pregnant. This brings all of them to the court of justice and other people enter in scene including the woman's husband who didn't know she had been hired to take care of the old man. The plot develops itself in severel conflicts of lies and truths and sayings and retractions that lead to severe somewhat unexpected complications. Since we are in a Muslim country where most people are deeply religious the invocations of and oaths on the Koran are frequent.

After all, tons of people have to deal with elderly parents with Alzheimer's. There are plenty of divorces for trivial and non-trivial reasons. Good help is hard to find and even harder to afford.

Farhadi does not make it black or white which is too simple for his capacity. Rather than demonizing the upper class, Nader is a good and decent person, and that incident itself would not be his fault. However, the process and the result are not in favor of Razeih's family.

Beautiful performances by Payman Maadi as Nader, Sarina Farhadi as his daughter Termeh, and Shahab Hosseini as Hojjat. Director Asghar Farhadi does a craftsman's job by slowly unraveling layer by layer the truth about alleged aggression against a pregnant woman.

I thought the point might be showing the Dominoe effect of how one thing leads to another until things get really out of hand.

It asks the audience to be in the young daughter's shoes who was charged with the question which demanded a King Solomon's wisdom. And the audience went back over the film frame by frame and each according to his or her religious belief, cultural background, philosophical persuasion and social class would come to a different conclusion. Who is right and who is wrong? Or is there a winner no matter what is the decision? The film starts with a choice- personal fulfillment or filial duty overlaid with matrimonial complications. People from the west would vote for individual freedom and aspirations-maybe and folks from the east would frown upon a dereliction of filial obligations-maybe. Then the film introduced a compromise by a religious woman to earn income for her family. Again certain religious people would forbid such an arrangement- woman taking care of a man no matter how elderly or infirm and lay people would approve of her diligence. Then the film brought in a civil matter. Was he guilty and deserving the harsh sentence imposed by the law of the land and if not was the victim not deserving to be compensated? Did the parties involved not stretch the truth or hide the truth? Folks with European background might prefer the truth and nothing but the absolute truth and likewise folks with less stringent legal culture might prefer a folksy conclusion. Then there is the social class angle. Does the victim from poor background have the right to resort to violence or the well-off can hide behind legal wrangling? Then there is the middle ground but religion would complicate it and civil laws would not recognize it. And the teenage daughter with all the innocence of a newborn and the conscience of a common man would be required to make a choice and she is us the audience. The film did give us a hint. A man might win the war but lose the world and that might be the universal truth –east, west or middle east. A must see film.",

In my opinion, the producer couldn't implicate the viewer to be a accomplice in his project of depicting the under world of the Iranian family, namely, the ghost of divorce. What are we supposed to do as viewers? the cast didn't let us in. Also, the climax was a little mountain that took but minutes. Added to that, the movie hints at the cultural breach or xenophobic trend toward what is Arabic. In one of the scenes when the daughter was rehearsing some vocabulary with the help of the father she came across some words that are from Arabic and she chose them. The reaction of the father was negative by stating that it should not be Arabic. Yes, Farsi is considered among the oldest languages in the world but that didn't prevent it from borrowing or loaning new words like "" mother"", ""father"",..etc.",
284,1 November 2020,sudhirkumarpal8,8, To the point and thought provoking.,"A must watch for anyone who is planning to get married soon. The expectation in a marriage and in a family. What it takes to make it work just like any other job.
Earlier I used to think the marriages were simple and smooth and the movie debunks that myth so clearly. Explains the behaviour of my parents some years back. But overall it's a big change from the bachelorhood to the family thing. And one should go for it only when one is prepared for that other wise it'll make life worse, if not the same.
Well! back to the movie. The storyline was amazing, especially the way some different plots were intertwined together. The story transitions so smoothly between the plots and at one point one is hardly able to tell the one from the another. The movie feels whole and complete with no loose ends left. At the end what we are left with are our own expectations and decision with the corresponding consequences be these good or bad. It's shocking to see that people still make the wrong choices many times despite the obvious consequences. Nothing can put it so good as this movie. It's like a mirror to the family life.
The characters were so perfect to tell if they were acting at all or may were so natural that they didn't need that. Living and stuck in an orthodox country run by the religion, where you have to call the priest to ask for permission to help one elderly incapacitated man. The pain of the same was so clearly visible on the faces of the characters, especially Simin's.

> The symmetry present in self-examination of conscience of the characters.
>The things we do are direct or indirect results of our situation and need. This is what makes the story and characters self-reflective which creates complications.

Keywords Iran and realism, stacked together was originally a blank area that I haven't known too much, but after watching it, the just plain bland throat was choked, and my heart slowly became calm again.
The story that the movie tells is the kind that everyone may encounter, and like many things we experience, in the end, I do n't know or say no one is right or wrong, and there is no happy or regretful ending to define whether it is comedy or Tragedy, because it does n't matter, our life continues after each decision. What kind of decision does not seem to change the life itself. For example, the last daughter said the name of the mother or father. The ending may be separation.
Reality is added to the color and temperature of the movie, and the director can also present it as it is. The clothes hanger he saw in his daze and the corner of the clothing were slightly raised by the wind.

In a non-European, non-western, 'Islamic' society, a global issue in a family could hardly be portrait better and would be served to the clear comprehension of anyone without any bias and irrelevant conceptualization.

A though decision (divorce) and events taking place aftermath are narrated without any explicit expression of what is lying beneath.

293,13 May 2015,yaizapez,9, An exciting thriller disguised as a realistic movie,"I had not idea what to expect when I started watching this movie. The title suggested something like a romantic story, and as the film is Iranian, I thought maybe it was about a forced separation of two lovers because of political reasons? It's quite the opposite. And the fact that it is from Iran gives only a background: This is not an ""exotic"" movie. And it's not romantic at all. At least not in the traditional way. This is a movie about how two people grow apart, how a relationship deteriorates because of the circumstances and communication gives way to misunderstandings, about how hope and a project together turn into disappointment and exasperation. And this is told in a way that makes the film so original and thrilling I'm still thinking about it some days after I watched it. There is a brilliant dialog in the movie that condenses all the drama of a separation: - But you said it wasn't serious. - Well, it became serious. Perfect.",
294,15 October 2012,cldcls,1, Disappointed,"I was very excited to see this foreign film as I am a big fan of non-Hollywood movies. I saw the movie thinking it had a fresh and different theme for an Iranian movie. Most of the Iranian films I've seen relate to religion and traditions in the Arabic countries. I was also surprised to see Iranian women having a very different life style- The last Iranian movie I saw was ""The Stoning of Soraya."" Again, I was pleased to see a different movie. The photography was also great. The actors performances were very realistic. The grandfather really looked as if he was suffering of Alzheimer. However, I was really disappointed with the ending of this story. I was left with the feeling of an unfinished product. Who did the girl choose to live with? Whatever happen with all the lies told by the everyone involved in the abortion? What about the poor grandpa? Is the woman going to leave the country with her daughter? Did they finally get divorced? Anyway, very disappointed.",
295,17 April 2011,bhomaii,7, It's only good when compared to other Iranian films.,"Last week, despite the fact that I normally despise Iranian movies, I went to see Asghar Farhadi's ""A Separation"". To make a long story short, the film was more or less disappointing. It's not that it was not good, but that it had nothing to offer internationally. I've seen movies by Fellini, Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Bergman, Korosawa, Tykwer, Kubrick, Lynch, Fincher, Burton, Allen and other genius minds in the universe of the seventh art; and this movie didn't even have the potential to be compared to their works. ""A Separation"" had a better script in comparison to ""About Elly"", though, to my idea, the ending was pretty immature and not as sophisticated as the rest of the film. Acting was OK, but cinematography, mis-en-scene, editing, and direction still needed massive improvement. Sound, music, use of colors and etc. have utterly been neglected by the director.",

302,28 December 2021,abbadindiaguy,5, wat,"Hidlren of Heaven"", ""The Color of Paradise"", ""The Willow Tree"" and ""Baran"". I have also seen several other wonderful film by other Iranian directors. So, I was quite interested in seeing ""A Separation"" when it arrived at a local theater. And, I am glad I had a chance to see it. The film begins with a man and wife both seeing a judge (or more like a referee) to discuss a divorce. The wife wants to leave Iran (exactly why is never discussed, by the way--an interesting omission) but the husband is adamant--he won't leave his father, as the father has Alzheimer's. This is an odd reason to want a divorce and as the audience knew nothing about the family, it was easy to dislike the wife and side with the husband--especially since they have a daughter who is in the middle. But the wife insists--she WILL leave whether he divorces her or not. Most of the rest of the film centers on the husband. You have to feel for the guy--his wife insists on leaving, his father is in the mid-late stages of the disease and he is having a devil of a time finding someone to care for the man. His prayers seem to be answered when he finds a woman willing to watch him--and at the price he can afford. However, this is early in the film and there is LOTS to come. I'd say more about the plot, but there are so many surprises, I'd rather just leave it to you to see yourself.n The film is great to watch because there are so many surprises and so many situations where people are faced with very tough choices and yet they seem to make the wrong ones again and again--all due to stubbornness. Such simple things like apologizing or even talking out problems--all these seem beyond people. And, in the process, two children from two separate families are stuck in the middle--with HUGE pressures put on them by their parents. As a result of all this, I can guarantee that it's a film that will get you thinking and have a strong emotional impact. It's also a great film to see with friends because I could easily see the film stimulating a ton of discussion afterwords. Intelligent and very complex--the only reservation I have is that the film is unrelentingly sad and tough to watch. I could imagine some viewers just tiring of all this, as it's like an extended Bickerson's skit--without any jokes or levity--just anger, horrible decisions, selfishness and isolation. Sad but profound.",

326,28 January 2019,dragicakosir,10, Muslim world or the West - We share the same problems,"Although the setting of the film is located in the islamic cultural milieu, the film very clearly shows a problem on the global scale. And, more importantly perhaps, a problem that is typical for our age.
The story is about a separation of a married couple which was in turn influenced by a previous separation, i.e. a division into richer and poorer classes. In the foreground are two families, from one social class each as well as the jurisdictional authority. The rich and the poor have in common that they are both seeking the guilt in the outside world. Particularly tragical is that they point they are pointing their finger at those who are closest to them.
Yet, here we can see even the third separation: the young ones are withdrawing from the old ones, because they were already as children probably not really taken into account. Such an attitude does not bring any improvement and, as the things get even more complicated, eventually the judicature must intervene. Nevertheless, exactly in the person of the judge (Your Holiness) with whom they are dealing with the whole corruptness is reavealed - althouigh there should be no room for it there in the first place. Lacking any deeper reflection, the latter is prepared to put a man behind bars. The row in front of the door is long. But as soon as the one who has money pays the bail he can already be set free, as if he had not been considered dangerous to the society even a moment before.
The cast ist excellent, while the denouement of the film is left to each viewer. I was shocked by the appalingly open question of responsibility - so evident to all, so close to us all, yet so easy to overlook. In any case, well worth watching!",

For example, in this film, the focus and emphasis on the tense and critical situations between characters and often with exaggerated dialogues and sequences in the intensity of acting and play, somehow try to mislead the viewer and attract the audience by a fuss in the scene of the film. The open ending in the works of Asghar Farhadi is, in fact, a fugitive from the director to avoid the correct ending to the script.

The scenario has lots of potent characters to maneuver on them. In an attempt to depict all of them, Farhadi fails to present a deep picture of their emotional status quo in about 120 minutes. simply there are too much emotional relations: Nader and Simin, Nader and Terme, Nader and his father, Simin and Terme, Simin and Nader's father, Razieh and Hojjat, Razieh and her kid, Hojjat and his kid, Razieh and Nader's father, and The kid and Terme.

343,23 March 2021,winterimtheforeignfilmfestival,9," Family vs Pride - Winterim, The Foreign Film Festival","""A Separation"" is about the story of a family going through a legal issue. When Nader and his wife separate, he goes through the challenges of caring for his daughter and his ailing father. Things spiral out of control when Nader is charged with the murder of an unborn infant. Through the movie we see the choices Nader and his family have to make, from pressing charges on the caregiver for elderly abuse to choosing which parent to live with. The raw emotion expressed by the characters portrays the gravity of the film. We feel like the type of audience that would enjoy this movie are people who like drama and some intensity. While the film bounces around inconsistently to different characters, we think that this was done in a way that does not subtract from the feel of the film. The chaos of the lives of the characters are reflected in the chaos of the film itself. You could say say that there are times when some scenes were either be repetitive or mundane, but this only takes up a small part of the film. The movie is able to constantly throw unexpected twists up until the last scenes of the movie, and as viewers that is an element that we particularly enjoyed. Overall, the movie is very good and there's not much we can fault it on, the reason this is not a ten is because we would never say this our my favorite movie, or even a contender of it, it doesn't stick out enough or leave with that feeling of satisfaction you would get from a favorite movie.

But it takes time until you realize that. Anyway, I can almost guarantee you sit the film through, until the final post-texts has passed.",

The movie is full of social issues most of them happen in different societies like getting a divorce and it discusses the reasons that lead to it and, of course, the consequences that follow such decisions. The movie also mentions the problems that happen to the children under these circumstances and the relations between them and both parents. It also contains the relationship between a son and his old sick father. As we know him, Asghar Farhadi made every single moment in this movie thrillingly filled. The movie won an Oscar for best foreign language film and it completely deserves it. And Asghar Farhadi got a nomination for best writing, original screenplay.",

362,25 September 2016,hammed_del,10, Watch Afain,"an unhappily married couple break up in this complex, painful, fascinating Iranian drama by writer-director Asghar Farhadi, with explosive results that expose a network of personal and social faultlines. A Separation is a portrait of a fractured relationship and an examination of theocracy, domestic rule and the politics of sex and class – and it reveals a terrible, pervasive sadness that seems to well up through the asphalt and the brickwork. In its depiction of national alienation in Iran, it's comparable to the work of Jafar Panahi and Mohammad Rasoulof. But there is a distinct western strand. The film shows a middle-class household under siege from an angry outsider; there are semi-unsolved mysteries, angry confrontations and family burdens: an ageing parent and two children from warring camps appearing to make friends. All these things surely show the influence of Michael Haneke's 2005 film Hidden. Farhadi, like Haneke, takes a scalpel to his bourgeois homeland.",

364,21 February 2015,dervish-sedi,9, moving and brutally frank,Something peculiar made me deeply drawn to this film. It was very raw and simple and oh so real I was so indulged in it I almost forgot it was just a movie... apart from the great yet very simple plot it was also the actors with their outstanding performance that charged the movie with this flow of deep genuine emotions and made it roughly analogous to all the absurdity and pain we experience in our lives. One clear example is how we're forced in some way to sympathize with almost each character and not having the ability to judge or categorize any of them under some label.i think delivering this idea with this raw genuine attitude is what makes this film a mind blowing one.,

It showed the emotions between husband & wife, father & daughter, son & father & it's beyond that. It also tells the story of human's belief in religion. It will show you that a moment's fault can cause a disaster to you. Watch the movie and you will not regret.",
370,4 August 2019,seccon,8, Good drama but misleading synopsis,"This is a good drama, especially for a Western audience since it portrays much of what I believe to be daily Iranian life, but the synopsis is very misleading as that is a very secondary and minor subplot. The story revolves mostly around the conflict between two families with their own internal conflicts, as the son of the Alzheimer's afflicted elderly is charged with causing the miscarriage of his father's caretaker, the woman in the other family. It is at least interesting to see how religion seems to have such a huge impact in these people's decisions, but I must confess that I was expecting to see a much more harsh reality of state authoritarianism. Anyway, the movie does an excellent job in presenting ordinary people dealing with complicated problems pilling up one onto another, and in my mind brought a refreshing humanizing view to overly religious people.",

The film is a scathing dispute; no one questiones religion, does not humiliate a woman, or does not condemn some of the constitutional laws of Iran. You might imagine Nader and Simin infect the atmosphere from the very first seconds. Indeed, they look at their unfinished quarrels, and they hold each other upright. But the interesting point is that in a Western society, they are either a couple or severely cohabited or friendly. Usually there is no other way in Western societies!",

Of course, the film shows the Iranian society and culture, which I, as an Iranian viewer, completely understood this film. The plot of the story is set with patience and it gets better as it progresses and the viewer gradually puts himself in the film's atmosphere without using sexual tools and very beautiful women and handsome men; It attracts the audience to the story of the film.

406,6 December 2017,ali-ghasemi,10," Love does not consist of gazing at each other, but in looking together in the same direction.","The ability to see events from different perspectives is one of the most important elements of a successful relationship, whether it involves a married couple, a parent and child, or a group of nations. Warring parties are always convinced that they have right or, in some cases, God on their side. To them, every action they take is fully justified and every act the other party takes is sinister. The failure to see other people's perspectives is in full view in Asqhar Farhadi's brilliant A Separation, winner of the Best Foreign Film award at the Golden Globes and nominated for an Oscar in the same category. Farhadi does not ask us to choose sides but to observe how decisions made with good intentions and for the alleged benefit of others often have the opposite effect. The film opens in a courtroom in Tehran as Simin (Leila Hatami) speaks to a judge, unseen by the camera, asking him to grant her a divorce from Nader (Peyman Moaadi) her husband of fourteen years. Simin wants to leave the country and take her 11-year-old daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), with her to seek better opportunities abroad. Nader, a bank employee, however, will not leave Iran because of his responsibility to care for his elderly father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) coping with Alzheimer's disease. Even though they have been married for fourteen years, there does not seem to be any hint of compromise. Unable to obtain the divorce because the judge deems the issues not ""serious"" enough, the couple agrees to separate with Simin going to her mother's house and Termeh staying with her father. ",

The plot twists should be considered the most successful because they keep the audience watching until the end. In addition, the director clearly put the same effort for every twist, making it as unexpected as possible for the audience. Not only does the movie carefully portray endless conflicts among family members, but the movie also delivers a simple message to parents: everything they do will affect their child one way or another, which they have to consider carefully before any action. Lastly, this movie shows the audience a view on Iran's culture and religion. It is phenomenal how characters in the movie respect their gods; they are really serious when it is the matter of sins and swearing under the gods.",
