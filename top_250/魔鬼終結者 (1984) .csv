0,4 August 2002,Smells_Like_Cheese,10, This is the movie that made a big break through for sci-fi movies!!!!,"The Terminator is one of those films that no matter if you've seen it or not, you've heard of it, heck you know at least one or two lines without seeing it! This is the movie that blasted then new comer's Arnold Schwartzeneggerr's career, made James Cameron a name in Hollywood, and gave new meaning to a possible dark future that gave us nightmares. I remember the first time I saw this movie, I was just 8 years old and my dad of course walks in saying to cover my eyes at every ""bad"" scene with violence or nudity, needless to say about 70% of the movie he covered my eyes. Finally I got to see it with my mom and I was in love, this wasn't just an action movie, though it is one of the best, it had a story. To think this was all based upon just a quick nightmare that James Cameron had, he didn't have much money, but he had a good script, a great crew on his side to make one of cinema's greatest movies of all time.",/
1,5 June 2003,MovieAddict2016,10, The best of the best in its genre...,"Rarely has a film so frightened an audience as ""The Terminator."" After its release in 1984, the extremely low-budget sci-fi actioner broke box office records, and gave audiences something more to fear. Through the years, there have been stories of nature's beasts, of creatures from another world, and so on and so forth. ""Jaws"" was terrifying because it seemed so possible. And if ""Jaws"" is terrifying, ""The Terminator"" is horrific. The realization of this hit-man machine dawned on everyone watching the film. In a time of exceeding technology, how long will it be before man is overtaken by the very things he created? And that is what is particularly scary about a film like ""The Terminator."" ",r
2,15 July 1999,baumer,10, Nice night for a walk.,"Is there a better person to play a cyborg than Arnold?  For this movie he was a massively built oak tree of a man.  His strange accent makes for a perfect callous robotic sounding killing machine.  It's almost like his voice is a computer read out ( which I guess it is in one sense ). Terminator is one of those films that started something huge.  People didn't realize it at the time, but the careers of Arnold, Cameron and perhaps even guys like Micahel Biehn, Lance Henriksen and even Bill Paxton were substantially started because of this film.  And Cameron must have liked working with them so much that he gave all of them substantial roles in his next film ( Aliens ).",e
3,5 January 2018,ivo-cobra8,10, Schwarzenegger's my personal favorite best action classic masterpiece of all time,"The Terminator (1984) is a masterpiece, the best sci-fi action classics horror movie that started all the Terminator movies. This is Schwarzenegger's best movie and my personal favorite action film. I love this film to death it is my childhood film I grew up with it. Arnold Schwarzenegger was The Terminator T-800 Model 101 indestructible killing machine cyborg. This movie is brilliant, it has brilliant story, brilliant plot, excellent additional cast, brilliant director and writers, good special effects, it is mixed with sci-fi, action and horror. This movie deals with the war that was set in the future but the battle will be fought in the present. It deals with paradox travel trough time.",v
4,28 January 2011,axlrhodes,10," The Terminator has heart. Cameron might be well advised,less is more.","Many people look back at the films of James Cameron and suggest that the smaller, the budget, the tighter the limitations, the better the end product. Films like Avatar, Titanic and True Lies had huge budgets and drew in even bigger box office but many still yearn for the Cameron that gave us The Terminator and Aliens which were huge movies but packed a far bigger punch artistically. My feelings all these years on are that Cameron has earned the right to make those huge movies but i have to admit to preferring his earlier body of work. The Terminator is a nightmarish, time travelling science fiction film told at a breakneck pace and delivered with confidence and style. The film has a very gritty, underground look to it and does a great job of telling its story amid the frenetic action. There is also a huge slice of horror and suspense thrown in, an impression that has diminished in the years since it's release due to inferior sequels. Viewed as a standalone piece however, The Terminator is fine piece of work from a director with a very clear vision.Everyone knows that The Terminator is the film that gave us Arnold Schwarzenegger but when i look back at the film, it has heart and its the Michael Biehn character, Kyle Reese, that provides it Artistically speaking,Cameron might be well advised that less is more.",i

10,3 January 2011,gigan-92,10," Bold, Gritty, and Realistic","The 1984 classic, an astounding production. One of Cameron's early works, and yet one of his best. The ultimate thing that puts this film on a whole another level above so many other flops is the awesome blend of realism and atmosphere. When I first saw it as a kid, it just felt so real to me. And now, ten years later,t that feeling hasn't left me. Using his camera in a way only he can do, Cameron instills a sense of dread in every scene, something good old Arnold did quite well.",5
11,11 November 2016,Leofwine_draca,10, A beloved favourite of mine,"Widely regarded as something of a classic in the realms of science fiction and action films, I think that this film is an underrated horror film and may be in fact one of the most frightening films I have ever seen, due to the fact that I had a fascination for it as a child. Director James Cameron, better known to modern audiences for his bloated epic TITANIC, truly succeeded in creating a classic film, one which I would watch many times over his later, waterlogged dreck. THE TERMINATOR was a hugely popular hit and created a new movie monster, the big, silent, hulking figure of Arnold Schwarzenegger in what I believe to be his best role as an unstoppable killer. The fact that the monster is human - and thus able to hide amid fellow humans - is relatively original (depends on who you speak to, but acknowledgement definitely goes to Harlan Ellison) and his sheer indestructibility is really awe-inspiring.",0
12,30 January 2005,FrankBooth_DeLarge,10," An excellent film, highly original","Terminator is an extremely low budget movie. In fact, just about everything used in it didn't cost much at all, but it is a very effective movie. Back in the '70's and 80's, movies could be very low budget, but still be great(think of John Carpenter's Halloween).",2
13,16 March 2018,invisibleunicornninja,8," Old, but still good.","This movie is a solid action movie. Not all of the dialogue is great and some of the effects are a bit dated - but this movie is still effective. The acting is great. The plot is great. This movie is well-shot and worth watching. I can't really come up with many things that are bad about it that don't have to do with it being old. This is just a fun movie with good action, time travel, and robots. I'd definitely recommend this movie. Its worth watching if you're looking for a good time.",3
14,19 April 2003,PeachHamBeach,10, Review of the Special Edition DVD,"I've reviewed this classic movie before, but now I'm gonna review the DVD. To start, I must say that although they had their rationale for deleting the ""terminated"" scenes, as they were called, I think they definitely should have left that one scene in where Sarah Connor calls her mom and tells her to hide in the cabin, and where she finds the listing of Cyberdyne Corp. in the phone book. This scene established Sarah as one who is willing to try to take matters into her hands to stop a nuclear war and a horrible future. She talks to Reese about getting rid of Cyberdyne and they get into an arguement about whether or not that is a mission objective and Reese ends up chasing Sarah into a wooded area. I think the beauty of the woods, flowers and waterfalls was important too, because Reese starts crying and saying how all of this is destroyed, and the future is nothing but blackened, charred ruins littered with the skulls of attempted human genocide. What a terrific, powerful scene. I adore Michael Biehn, and I didn't realize what a great actor (and crier) he is!!! Maybe the other ""terminated"" scenes were okay to delete, although they were all delightful. The one where Sarah practices her ""wholesome waitress"" routine was cute. The one where she talks about Disneyland and hot dogs might have seemed silly, but it really brought home how foreign our world is to Reese, as did the crying scene. The tickling scene might have seemed silly to the editor, but I thought it really made a point: after all the violence and bleakness Reese lived through, to be with the woman he's always loved and idolized, to lay in a cozy warm bed with her experiencing the simple joys of life for the first time (I still wonder if Sarah devirginized him, since he said he'd ""never"" had any special someone in his life) seemed to bring everything into perspective. The scene where you discover that the factory was Cyberdyne Systems was important too, but I'll let these scenes slide. I really think they should consider releasing a TERMINATOR with the scene in the wooded area included. Nevertheless, I still consider this film as one of my favorite sci-fi films, and my favorite James Cameron film. I still admire who he infuses humanity with action and adrenaline, and the missing scenes were wonderful.",0
15,29 December 2020,auuwws,9, The terminator,"A very great action movie, despite the presence of some shots of boredom in the film, but it did not significantly affect my experience with the film, the Terminator was terrifying in the film, his role was played with all the ingenuity of the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger I cannot imagine another actor representing the character, Sarah and Kyle's relationship was not very interesting The soundtrack in the movie was great, especially the one with, the Terminator, the storyline of the action movie was very good, the film really enthused me for the other parts.",9
16,22 January 2006,DaRick89,10, The wonderful action movie which started a wonderful action saga,"The Terminator is one of the best action movies of all time in my opinion. It doesn't set a single foot wrong and it also kicked off a wonderful saga. Without this, there would be no Terminator 2. Think about that. As such, this movie is fondly remembered by many people and it has been the subject of many quotes and spoofs over the years. Why doesn't it set a foot wrong? It is thrilling, almost always entertaining and filled with insane explosions, which more or less makes a good action movie. But 'The Terminator' stands head and shoulders above the rest of it's genre, because of it's well thought-out plot, splendid acting and an eerily memorable music score which gives you a reason to watch the credits at the end.",1
17,21 August 2007,springsunnywinter,10," The best of the best movies ever on the planet, galaxy & the entire universe","The Terminator simply has to be my number 1 favourite movie of all time. When the first time I saw the film I fell in love with it about 15 years ago. The truly original idea of the story-line is amazing about a cyborg is sent from the future on a deadly mission. He has to kill Sarah Connor, a young woman whose life will have a great significance in years to come. Sarah has only one protector - Kyle Reese - also sent from the future. The Terminator uses his exceptional intelligence and strength to find Sarah. The movie was emotionally & psychologically thrilling and made so dark & sinister that give the tensive mood for the film. A well made for 80's film and I was surprised when I heard that it made with a budget of $6.4 million because it looks more expensive e.g. the nuclear war in Los Angeles 2029. I loved every second of it and the best scenes are:",/

20,22 September 1998,behamut,10, Awesome,"The Terminator, created after another one of James Cameron's reaccuring dreams (Abyss was another one.)  A true beginning in sci-fi movies.  As Schwarzenegger said to his friend when he was picked to play the part as the Terminator, ""they want me to play as some robot from the future in this weird sci-fi movie."" His friend said, ""take it."" Schwarzenegger is perfect as the Terminator, merciless, no fear, no love, no pity, no remorse, no emotions.  None could have pulled it off as well as he did.  Even his eyes showed no emotion with still showing true evil. Michael Beign is just the opposite.  A man sent from the future to stop this machine.  He plays his part as perfect as Schwarzenegger plays his.  A perfect cast of characters for an all star movie! Plenty of action, story line, plot, character interaction, love story, and romance.  Everything is tied into this movie that possibly could be, making it a 3 star movie.  Only drawback is it's a little dragged out at parts and gets slightly boring from time to time but it's so minor that one would have to think about it to care. A truly awesome movie.",e
21,25 February 2005,PhilipJames1980,9, The ultimate blend of Orwell and action,"Even in this post-Matrix era, this movie is still the ultimate blend of Orwell and action.

23,4 March 2000,catalyst-7,9, It's about transformation,"I just saw a horrifying, touching, very good movie again; it's The Terminator.  Now to talk of it as great film, to compare it with American Beauty might seem idiotic--it's an almost unrelentingly dark, violent, frightening action movie, after all--but strip away the relentless action, strip away the technophobia, strip away the blatant dislike of cops and modern youth, strip away the poignant love story and, at its core, it's about an immature, essentially mindless girl becoming a strong, determined woman.

25,31 December 2019,Hitchcoc,9, Amazing Intensity,"When this film was released I hesitated, not being a big fan of Arnold's. But his stolid performance (without any emotion) was really quite good. The plot line of a thing from the future taking on human form and trying to put an end to a problem through murder is quite captivating. Of course, the issue of time travel to the past is always fodder for criticism. Of course, we have the sequels, using computer generated special effects (which are remarkable).

32,7 March 2012,fredericksmith1952,10, Based on the writings of science fiction author Harlan Ellison,"Based on the writings of science fiction author Harlan Ellison, James Cameron's dark vision of the future was a launching pad for several careers in Hollywood. Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the height of his career and appearance in 1984, so his size and musculature made him the perfect choice to play the killing machine from the future. Linda Hamilton became a star after a somewhat lackluster career by portraying Sarah Connor, a role she reprises in T2: Judgment Day. Micheal Biehn, a heretofore minor character actor, gained overnight popularity as Kyle Reese and went on to film other action films, including Navy Seals and Aliens. Even Lance Henriksen can claim a large amount of his success on his role as Det. Hal Vukovich, and both Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson were seen early in their careers thanks to their brief but memorable roles as the punks who first confront the Terminator.",

38,7 April 2004,DarthBill,10, The kind of film that aspiring screen writers of today wish they had thought of first...,"When James Cameron finally got the Terminator made, the studio refused to advertise it as a ""science fiction film"", which puzzled Cameron. When he asked why, they said it didn't count as science fiction because it wasn't set in outer space like Star Trek and Star Wars. Jim shot back that it was science fiction because it dealt with time travel and cyborgs. This was significant for science fiction film making because, as much fun as those out of this world galaxies are, science fiction can still be compelling when set on Earth. The film also made a star out of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Well, technically ""Conan the Barbarian"" did that, but ""Terminator"" helped him break out of costume films and get into the shoot 'em ups.",

42,25 December 2015,anaconda-40658,9, He'll Be Back.,"The Terminator (1984): Dir: James Cameron / Cast: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, Paul Winfield: Exhilarating science fiction action film about all that is final. A cyborg drops to earth from an energy field. Underneath his perfect normality is a deadly machine programmed to kill Sarah Connor. A soldier from the future is sent via energy field to protect her because her life is important to the survival of the future John Connor. Extremely tense action particularly when it appears that the Terminator is virtually unstoppable. This makes room for interesting elements such as his ability to manipulate. James Cameron does an excellent job at staging the action as well as creating a convincing robotic structure. Arnold Schwarzenegger is overwhelming and intimidating as the cyborg whose defeat arrives when Connor uses the obvious against him. Michael Biehn is pushed to his physical limits as the soldier who is believed to be insane. Sarah is played by Linda Hamilton confused regarding a fate she didn't ask for. Lance Henriksen is unfortunately underused as a detective who could have provided an interesting investigating subplot. Paul Winfield plays another police official questioning Sarah Connor. The film is visually ahead of its time. Theme regards our problematic relationship with machines. Score: 9 ½ / 10",
43,17 December 2014,Rickting,9, Super strong sci-fi classic,"Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his most famous role, plays a brutal killing machine sent into the past to kill the mother of the resistance leader who leads the humans in the war against the machines in the future. A human soldier is sent back in time to protect her. Cue loads of sublime science fiction mayhem. The Terminator is inevitably dated due to the small budget, but it's a great time at the movies. It is a science fiction classic and completely deserves to be, thanks to the interesting story and strong action sequences. While it's a fast paced and snappy movie which hurtles along at breakneck speed, there's a moving relationship in the film and the elements of time travel give the story unexpected depth, which ensure the film certainly does not represent its iconic antagonist. Arnold Schwarzenegger dominates the screen in brilliant badass fashion and while he doesn't have many lines, he delivers them excellently and is an intimidating and threatening villain, although he's still not as cool as R2 D2 and C3PO.",

Not Arnold ""The Governor"" Schwarzenegger, but Michael Biehn. If there is an actor who is less appreciated for his work, then i don't know as much about cinema as I thought. He is, in my opinion, one of the greatest actors of all time, but he hits a peak in James Cameron's 1984 film ""The Terminator"". From the moment when he first steals that tramp's pants to his heroic death, he acts with a degree of intensity and skill that is rarely seen in film today. True, the rest of the cast are fantastic, and the script and direction are basically perfect, but for me the highlight of this film will always be Michael Biehn. I do think that The Terminator is one of my favourite films, and one i never tire of watching. its f***ing amazing!",

64,22 May 2011,blazesnakes9,10, Arnold Schwarznegger is THE TERMINATOR.,"Science Fiction comes a long way through aliens and flying saucers. Then, when Star Wars came out in 1977, the science fiction grew to a new level. Also, the special effects were mind-blowing during that time. But now, a science fiction movie about a robot from the future emerges. The robot is called The Terminator. The Terminator is a dark and action-packed picture about a killing machine sent back through time to kill a woman who hold the key of the future. The Terminator is played by Arnold Schwarznegger, and he has a frightening performance as the metal cyborg assassin. The woman who holds the key to the future is played by Linda Hamilton. She is the victim of the killer cyborg as she is chased around Los Angeles. But, someone else also came back from the future. A solider named Kyle Reese and he is played by Micheal Biehn. The Terminator has great cinematography and develops a personality for the Terminator. In one scene after being shot in the eye, he pulls his damaged eyeball out of his eye socket and reveals the red vision that he sees. After that, he picks up a pair of glasses. The Terminator is a menacing villain that is unbeatable and destructive. All in all, this movie is a good and great one. There are good performances and great cinematography. ★★★★ 4 stars",
65,5 January 2015,ahegde3149,9, Original and classic sci-fi action,"After hearing many times to watch terminator series and seeing good reviews finally saw all the terminator movies over the weekend. Being a big fan of sci-fi genre, must say this movie establishes another incredible sci-fi universe like alien,matrix,etc. even though last 2 movies were disappointing. Even if the effects looked very dated, still its a evergreen classic which will be remembered for a long time. The dreadful and menacing 'Terminator' played stylishly by Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of his career defining roles. It feels like he was destined for the role. The Terminator Theme by Brad Fiedel with the clanging metal matches the character of Terminator perfectly and is one of the best themes of all time alongside likes of Star Wars. James Cameron makes skillful use of low-budget effect with a wonderful story. I admired his work in 'Titanic' and 'Avatar', but now I have realized his best work dates back in the 1980s-90s with the best film being 'Aliens'. ",
66,19 August 2014,moviemattb,10," A Classic Movie Of The 80s That Mixes With Action, Horror, And Science Fiction","""The Terminator"" is one of the most popular movies that was made back in the mid-80s, and it has been well-remembered by critics and audiences alike. Everyone has seen this movies and knows it quite well as much as its famous sequel ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" I don't know if I had anything new to say about this movie because everyone already knows well about ""The Terminator"" and why its so darn good about it. This movie was directed by James Cameron who would go on to make the second ""Terminator"" movie along with the second ""Alien"" movie, ""The Abyss,"" ""True Lies,"" ""Titanic,"" and now ""Avatar."" I know that Cameron considered this movie to be his first film because his previous film ""Piranha II: The Spawning,"" was going to be but some random people of the movie took over and wasn't like the way the Cameron envision it. So he just ignores that movie and considers ""The Terminator"" as his first film because he had more control than he had with the second ""Piranha"" movie. The movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, which it was his first time to play a villain and he really does a fascinating job to not only he embodied the character, but making it such a memorable role. He is the Terminator. Michael Biehn was also great as Kyle Reese along side with Linda Hamilton as John Connor's mother Sarah. The movie really does go at a really good pace, and it does keep you on the edge of your seat. The music by Brad Fiedel is one of the greatest scores that has ever been heard in this kind of movie with the use of synthesizer, and featuring the famous ""Terminator Theme."" The special effects in this movie are really good in this movie, especially with the design of the Terminator by the great Stan Winston. The effects are no ""Terminator 2,"" but they are still really good before there was any CGI as what most filmmakers are using by today's special effects. The story is really well told and very effective as the premise goes along without any subplots or any of that mumble jumble. All it is that one is really trying to protect Sarah Connor, while the other to terminate and that is all you need for a story like this. ""The Terminator"" is a classic movie of the 80s that mixes with action, horror, and science fiction. If you haven't seen this movie, check it out! I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",

Still, the movie remains one of the most fascinating pieces of cinema history. It may show its age in some parts, where it's ""so 80's"" and goofy you'll probably have to giggle or roll your eyes and Arnold delivers his few lines with an accent thicker than pudding, but beside these minor scenes, it has aged well and truly reminds me that they don't make them like that anymore.

71,3 November 2012,Hey_Sweden,10, A career highlight for Cameron and Schwarzenegger.,"Filmmaker James Cameron had already showed a real style and vision when working for Roger Corman's special effects and art department, also learning well how to shoot fast and on a low budget. Here his talent and experience paid off with this breakthrough film, truly a model action picture with its unflagging pace and intensity level. It moves forward quite well while also remaining coherent, telling an interesting story that owes a debt to not only the works of Harlan Ellison, as is credited at the end, but Michael Crichtons' ""Westworld"". Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers a credible star performance as the title character, a cyborg sent to 1984 from the future by an omnipotent artificial intelligence. It wants to ensure that its primary human enemy, a man named John Connor, is never born, so the terminator is sent back in time to assassinate his mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton). Fortunately, a protector for Sarah is also sent back, a sensitive soldier named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn). Reese will have his work cut out for him not only trying to keep Sarah alive, but convincing her that his wild sounding story is indeed reality. ""The Terminator"" has incredible atmosphere, in both its present and future scenes, and has some wonderful eye popping visuals, not to mention fantastic special effects work by Stan Winston. Brad Fiedel's music score is catchy and iconic, but sounds even more haunting and effective when it's done as a simple piano melody. The editing (by Mark Goldblatt), art direction (by George Costello), and cinematography (by Adam Greenberg) are all first rate. The movie does date itself in certain ways (fashion styles and music), but that merely adds to the appeal in this viewers' humble opinion. It's also not wall to wall action, as it takes some breathers here and there, and is really quite touching in some of its quieter moments. The casting is spot on all the way down the line. Schwarzenegger is perfect as the relentless killing machine, especially as the role doesn't require a lot of dialogue, the under-rated Biehn does a nice job of selling his character and the material, and appealing Hamilton does a fine job with her character arc as Sarah changes from being kind of a mousy person to being more take-charge. The excellent supporting cast features such reliable people as Lance Henriksen (who's a hoot), Paul Winfield, Rick Rossovich, and Earl Boen, and there are some wonderful bits for Bill Paxton, Brian Thompson, and Dick Miller. Cameron and co-writer / producer Gale Anne Hurd inject the film with a decent dose of humour (such as the terminator cycling through various possible responses to a question) that never becomes too prevalent. ""The Terminator"" is simply one of the best films of its kind, and its impact on pop culture (including Arnolds' best known cinematic one-liner of them all) is undeniable. A must see for sci-fi and action lovers. Followed by three sequels and the 'Sarah Connor Chronicles' TV series. 10 out of 10.",
72,2 January 2021,njboden,10, Should be back in the top 250!,"It's a disgrace that this iconic film isn't in the top 250 anymore, in fact it leads the list of the 'shadow 100', films that have been in the IMDb list for the longest in the order that they stopped being there, Let's get The Terminator, Groundhog Day, Dog Day Afternoon and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid back in the top 250 again!

73,23 December 2014,thekansan726,10, Great Film,"A great science-fiction film with a compelling story. James Cameron does a good job interweaving a science-fiction narrative with other elements. The movie is considered an independent film with a low budget, but it feels much more than that. The animation for the time is actually done quite well, especially for being a low budgeted film. Linda Hamilton does a great job in the film. She doesn't over act her lines and the end of the film I felt she really outshone in the factory and leaving John her message. Michael Biehn also does a great performance and Arnold Schwarzenegger does a good job, he may of had very few lines but his physical acting is very well done. Schwarzenegger did a good job at portraying a cyborg with use of movements. The dream sequences in the film that go back and forth between the future and the present is amazing, gives it more of a chilling sense knowing that their future is full of hardship and turmoil. Overall this film is amazing and for being 30 years old, is still going to stand the test of time.",
74,27 August 2014,Mr-Fusion,9, Nightmarishly gripping,"You hear the name James Cameron and immediately think of big Hollywood spectacle. I mean, if nothing else, he's a consummate showman. And yet, one of his best movies works strictly on economy. ""The Terminator"" takes the B-movie premise of a killer robot stalking a young woman and infuses it with imagination. It's a terrific script that takes time travel, a love story and a nightmarish vision of the future and weaves it all into something exciting. You can see the constraints of the budget in the DIY effects, but the real joys of this movie lie in its flawless pacing and brutal efficiency. Schwarzenegger is imposing enough, but the image of the endoskeleton in the factory is still scary as hell.",

Back in present-day Los Angeles, his mother – a timorous pushover waitress Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) - is unaware of her role in the struggles to come, until the arrival of our titular terminator, whose only purpose is to kill her and thereby change the future. Her only hope is a bashful guerrilla fighter Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) who has followed the T-800 back through time to prevent her death and evade any and all attacks from the killer cyborg, while gradually forming a romance with her throughout the mission to preserve her life.

One of them even seems to want to kill her and ruthlessly kills two other Los Angeles women named Sarah Connor. The movie is pretty well directed with the tone being ominous at the beginning and more exciting as the story moves on. The mystery element is what makes it work in the first half, with us having no idea who these men are and why they are looking for her. There turns out to be an interesting revelation for it and a cool sci-fi paradox at the end. The action scenes are exciting, but it would have been better to have it more science fiction and less action as we only see a small part of the film focusing on the future. The climax is also very exciting and well done. The acting is good but the main character is not very interesting or likable, just your average woman. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays his character perfectly as an unstoppable emotionless freak, which is the strongest part of the movie.

But that led him to The Terminator, it started off as he was having a dream about being chased by a killer cyborg while he was on directing the Piranha sequel although he'd been bed ridden because he got sick from the food poisoning. Arnold Schwarzenegger was known as a body builder not really an actor. Originally Schwarzenegger wanted to play Kyle Reese the man sent from the future to protect Sarah Conner. But it ultimately went to Michael Biehn. This is for the best as Schwarzenegger's terminated is known now to be one of the best movie villain's of all times. James Cameron originally plan was to only have one movie but the success critically and commercially led to four sequels (one of which he directs). The visual effect's for the movie are amazing as for the time of the initial release no one had ever seen anything like it making James Cameron a legitimate filmmaker in Hollywood. The acting is strong and is easy to follow, the ending of the movie is what you wouldn't expect leaving you with hope. If you thought this is another low-budget crappy sci-fi thriller you'd be wrong as this movie launched James Cameron's career, Arnold Schwarzenegger's career, Michael Biehn, and Linda Hamilton's and with Bill Paxton's cameo. With James Cameron's direction the film is what it is today a classic that never get's old.",

121,1 August 2015,goreilly40,10, Definitive action movie of the decade,"Very rarely do you ever see an actor who fits a role so perfectly, it becomes almost impossible to imagine anyone else playing it, a few well known examples would be Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, Kurt Russell as Herb Brooks and Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela, well I would put Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator right up there, he just fits the role perfectly. His very presence, his movements and his deadpan emotionless mannerisms were in a word, perfect for the character. When he appears you just know somethings going to happen, the depiction of the Terminator's sheer relentlessness and ruthlessness in the pursuit of his mission are borderline frightening. Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor turns in a brilliant performance as an ordinary person trying to get by, whose life has suddenly been turned upside down by being thrown into what can only be described as a nightmare situation, likewise Michael Biehn as the war weary soldier still bearing the scars of a troubled if not traumatic past so much so he barely knows what happiness is. The action scenes are probably some of the best I've seen, particularly the final confrontation when you think, ""what more do they have to do to beat this thing?!"". Some of the lines of the dialogue and one line in particular, have since become legend and the most well known in cinematic history. The story is compelling and even thought provoking as to where humanity could end up in the future, even the soundtrack adds to the ominous tension which you feel while watching, especially the title track which like Arnie has become so synonymous with The Terminator that most people would be able to identify immediate which movie its in. This movie will go down as an all time classic definitive action movie, and its a must see for all action movie lovers. I'll finish by describing the ending, the movie's ending is spot on as there isn't the happy ending that most action movies tend to have which can feel like an anti-climax. Oh no this movie ends on an ominous note as Sarah Connor knows the future is far from bright paving the way for the Terminator's return, or as the man himself said, ""I'll be back.""",

123,1 December 2008,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,9," Excellent, holds up unbelievably well","There are a lot of marvelous reasons to love this. What exactly they are may vary, but I can give you my suggestions for a couple: It mixes a bleak, dystopian future vision with breathtaking, mind-blowing action(and without becoming a film that can't inspire you to think, and that goes for others done by the man who helmed this), and does so extremely well. It is blessed with the enthusiastic and perfectionistic direction of James Cameron, and it shows. The pacing is utterly impeccable. I could not tell you how many times I've watched this. The plot and science fiction are both fantastic, well-thought out, and hold up to thorough scrutiny, I've yet to find a genuine problem in them. The concept is terrifying, smart and thrilling. It all unfolds rather well. The script in general is spectacularly well-done. This never runs out of steam, and in spite of intensity, it doesn't overwhelm, either. All three of the listed genres are masterfully achieved here, and I would agree with anyone suggesting that ""horror"" should be mentioned, as well. The acting is magnificent, the performances are spot-on. Not sure I'd say that there are any exceptions to that. I became a fan of Biehn from viewing this. Schwarzenegger does pretty darn amazing. Henriksen is a lot of fun to watch, intentionally so. Lines are well-written and equally well-delivered. The score is synthesized and is a perfect fit. The music, clothes and special effects(which are almost invariably still incredible) are the only aspects of this that date it any. The guns are tremendously well chosen and handled(read the Trivia to see Arnie's efforts in that area). There is violence and some relatively disturbing sights in this, as well as a little sexuality/nudity, and a moderate amount of language, that can get strong. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the notion of an exciting movie with gun-fights, car-chases, a dark tone, well-done sci-fi, that just might provide food for thought, if you go in looking for that. 9/10",

126,9 July 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8, He'll be back.,"Since 'The Terminator (1984)' is so iconic, it's easy to forget just how downright solid its storytelling really is. I mean, the core concept alone is so 'out there' that it's a miracle it's as house-held as it currently is. It's really clever stuff. Basically, the feature takes the tropes of the 'slasher' genre and tells them through a science-fiction lens, with the classic 'unstoppable killer' literally being an unstoppable killing machine. The eponymous 'Terminator' doesn't think or feel and it has no sense of self-preservation. It exists for one purpose only: to kill the protagonist. All of this is excellently conveyed through performance (I needn't even mention Schwarzenegger), action and dialogue; the film takes its antagonist seriously so so do we. This makes for a tense and engaging experience that's effortlessly propelled by its world-building. This alone would make for a compelling story, but Cameron wasn't content with keeping things that simple. Instead, he decided to create one of the most satisfying time-travel narratives to date. The whole thing feels incredibly insular yet decidedly massive, as the relatively small-stakes central plot is perpetuated only by its context within the large-scale 'future war' and its world-ending consequences. Indeed, the flick is rather bold in its decision not to tie victory directly into 'saving of the world', rather to ensuring that it only gets destroyed so much: the nuclear war is inevitable but, eventually, the human resistance can win if it's allowed to exist in the first place. Having both the small-scale, in-the-moment, horror-driven elements and the near-intangible, sweeping, science-fiction stuff run simultaneously allows for a wonderfully unique and uniquely wonderful experience. Biehn's future-fighter, 'Reese', is a remarkably interesting character. The way he remembers things that haven't happened yet, his infrequent yet effective flashbacks to the post-apocalyptic future and the way he interacts with a version of a historical figure who has yet to do any of the things she's famous for are all intriguing and well-written. Also, the way he is used to convey exposition is particularly good, as it naturally hints at a much wider world than the budget could afford. Carter's 'Conner' initially comes across as a relatively generic 'final girl' but slowly garners more agency, culminating in a showdown that sees her finally accept what she must do to survive and do it with style. Her romance with 'Reese' is rushed, feels forced and, generally, could have been developed further, especially since it's integral to the story. Its introduction also marks a slower portion of the piece. Still, these issues are small when stacked against the flick's many positives. Overall, it's tense, exciting and enjoyable. It's a mash-up of many genres (including 'action', I'll add) that works far better than you might expect. Plus, its story, as iconic as it is, really is fantastic. 8/10",

There are some cheesy moments (""we loved a lifetime's worth"") and one wonders why they didn't send back a few more Reese's since the fate of humanity depended on it, but I liked the spare plot and flashbacks/forward to the nightmarish future.

130,7 May 2011,KineticSeoul,7, Good start for a notorious sci-fi franchise and it's the film that was a big break for Arnold,"This is a excellent sci-fi movie for it's time, it has a lot of the elements in this mixed together but works very well. The main villain is the one that stands out the most, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. He is basically a full machine in this literally when it comes to the plot aka The Terminator and he played his role in a pretty intimidating and menacingly manner, although he seemed a bit human at times when he is suppose to be a machine which isn't good. Especially since he is the villain and should not be showing emotions when it comes to facial expressions for this first movie in the franchise, even if it's slight at times. Although it will be different in the sequel, but for this it came off as a bit of a mistake, especially the mannerism in certain scenes. He just didn't seem like a full machine that is out to kill it's target because he seemed human, so it made the experience a bit slightly less frightening. But for it's time it's done very well. This is the beginning of a very notorious movie franchise that many people know of or at least heard about and I can see why by just watching this first movie. The script is well written and got my attention most of the way through even if it's a outdated and certain scenes just look way too fake. But even now this movie still holds up in today's standards because of the good direction and because it's well crafted. This movie also has classic phrases that are notorious and the way it reveals what is going on bit by bit is done pretty well, although some audiences will know what is going on pretty quickly, the execution is well crafted. This is a sci-fi/action movie with elements of horror and romance in it, but it's blended in just right and is worth seeing even if it's outdated by today's standards by a large margin and is a thrill to watch.",

It's also the reason that Arnold Schwarzenegger got work for so many years after as a star, with a performance that oddly enough features only a handful of lines of dialog.

Although Terminator 2 (also 3) were fantastic films with better action scenes and special effects than the first Terminator film, what I prefer about the first Terminator film is the good acting,(especially by Kyle Rees/Michael Biehn) sense of depth and storyline that the other two sequels lacked. What all three Terminator films had in common were that they had elements of Science Fiction and action in them, but what the first Terminator film had that the other sequels didn't have was that it had a romance element. The romantic side of this film is how Kyle Rees travelled back in time to meet Sarah Connor(to save her from the Terminator) and falling in love with one another, while conceiving their son John Connor during their short time together.

This machine is on a mission to kill a woman who is key to what could help the future, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), and the only man she can count on who knows most about this future is Kyle Reese (Michael Beihn), who also came from it. He tells her all about the Terminator, the war (Judgement Day) and why it is important she lives. She is the mother of the man who is the saviour for the human race, John Connor.

Those clothes, incidentally, should definitely not fit the much massive man, but that's merely one of a goodly figure of plot cavities that I only ever note after it's over: Like several ambitious thriller directors before him, Cameron reveals an exceptional skill at sustaining the action so summarily that this or that inconsistent detail doesn't matter.

Until one man from the future named Reese(Michael Biehn) who went after the cyborg to stop him. The Terminator seems to be more ruthless than any criminal of any class.

However, The Terminator got to a few wrong Sarah Connors. The first one, was a mother one bullet to the head was bad enough, did he have to totally ambush her?

He was very convincing. I honestly could have gave this a 7 had someone thought of the idea before. The idea alone is incredible. A cyborg human robot chasing someone from the future. And I watched the extras and it went over the cut outs and back lighting. They even made it look like they were running over skulls.

James Cameron really showed his talents as not only a writer, but as a film maker in this classic. The story is fluent, the pace is frantic and is grounded by excellent direction, great performances and good dialogue. The tone of the film is dark and its ambiance is amped up by Brad Fiedel's ominous and percussive score. Stan Winston's special make up f/x are top notch. While Arnold as The Terminator is a focal point and in this role he is perfect, it would be criminal to overlook the rest of the cast in this picture. Michael Biehn gave an exceptional, intense balls out performance here and carries the story delivering exposition while being chased by The Terminator. Linda Hamilton is great too. She shows a lot of range in this film. Lance Hendrickson and Paul Winfield give brief, but memorable performances as cops. There also are some cool cameos from Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson as punk rockers. This movie is a solid production and holds up well. I am not much of a fan of the sequels.

There are a lot of comments about plot holes, but there are always going to be possible paradoxes when it comes to time travel movies/books. The effects were pretty awesome for 1984. The terminator itself, with its relentless focus on its mission, has also become an iconic character/idea. You really have to give Cameron his props for imagination.

Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger give one of their best performances as Sarah Connor and The Terminator respectively. Congrats to all the cast and crew who made this movie happen!,

162,7 May 2016,PredragReviews,9, I'll be back...,"The original ""Terminator"" is arguably the greatest sci-fi/action film ever, and the Special Edition DVD finally does this classic film justice. In the future, SkyNET, the supercomputer in control of all military power, decides that humans must be destroyed and begins a massive nuclear war that destroys most of the population. The survivors form a resistance against the computer and its mechanical army, and eventually defeat it, thanks to their leader John Connor. In a final effort to win, the computer sends a Terminator back in time to kill John's mother, Sarah, before he is born. The humans send back a lone soldier, Kyle Reese, to protect Sarah from the seemingly unstoppable cyborg. I think what's so great about this movie is how you're slowly revealed the true form of the Terminator. Piece by piece he loses a chunk here, a chunk there. You know he's a machine with flesh over his endo-skeleton, but the full force of this implication isn't really felt until you see the machine without the flesh emerge from burning wreckage. I find the scene where the endo-skeleton is lurching very quickly toward the door as Sarah is struggling to close it far more terrifying than the whole Terminator apocalypse scenes in the sequels. But then again, those are action movies.",

The sound design is excellent, surprisingly good considering the age. The music fits with the tone but I did find it a touch synth which comes across as a bit cheesy. The story is actually really strong and incredibly well told. I love time travel and robots! The future war scenes compliment and contrast the eighties perfectly.

A piece of action-packed ""tech stuff"" on the surface, ""The Terminator"" comes a very long way from simply being a stylish noiresque chase movie with some time travel elements thrown in to spice it up. Because, first and foremost, this stuff is thoroughly rich in meaning. In essence, it's a superbly told tale of a lone warrior on a doomed mission who is given only a fleeting moment to share with the only one of his life. While desperately trying to protect her and everything human in human beings from forces so overwhelmingly destructive that they seem to be on par with the will of the gods in Greek tragedies. And the powerful background, permeated with a sense of impending fate, against which this drama is unfolding, apart from helping to deliver a serious and convincing message, somewhat unexpectedly turns it into one of the most poignant and poetic love stories – where love conquers time and space and the moment becomes eternal. So this picture should be named among very few actually substantial and emotional fables produced by the department of mainstream entertainment – as it sets off on an infinite journey far beyond the confines of a genre  and beyond the infinite.",

It's also one of my favorite James Cameron sci-fi films, along with Aliens and Avatar. Though Arnie is portrayed as a villain in this one, he literally steals the show.

203,5 June 2016,saymaraza,10, The Terminator review,"Fantastic film! my favourite film of the 80s along with Robert Zemeckis Back to the future. One of Arnold's first films as a professional Actor, and his most memorable role. With James Cameron directing, this is definitely my favourite film of his by far. Most people think that Terminator 2 is even better than this one. But for me, this beats it every time. I love Terminator 2, but i thought that it dragged out a lot longer than this film. This film was the perfect amount of time for a film to be running without getting boring. And leaves tension all the way. I used to be inspired by The Terminator when i was younger, and I'm pretty sure it was my favourite film at one point. Arnold Schwarzeneggar does such an amazing job as the Terminator, it's unbelievable. I know James Cameron tried to make him look cooler as the guardian in Terminator 2, but in this film to me is as cool as you can get. With supporting acts of Linda Hamilton (Sarah Conner) and Michael Biehn (Kyle Reese) the whole film is a complete blow-out! Schwarzeneggar was perfect for the role of The Terminator, with the size that he is, the one thing i didn't like with Terminator 2, is that he was the half the size he was in the first one. I know it was 7 years after the first one, and he had stopped bodybuilding, but still i think he should have been the same size as in the first one for playing a Terminator. With Terminator 2, it had a clever concept, and is probably the most well though out Terminator movie of them all, with Robert Patric playing a new style of Terminator. I think the first one if slightly better because it was Cameron's original idea for a film, and plus i think if you are playing a Terminator you need to be a considerably big and intimidating size like Arnold was.",

208,28 October 2021,adampkalb,10, A very fun romp through chase scenes by an evil robot from the future.,"I thought it was pretty cool how The Terminator premiered in the same year as another slasher film, A Nightmare on Elm Street. However, that movie is supernatural horror while this is science fiction horror. In The Terminator, the plot is always on the move - just like the main characters trying to get away from the T-800. Kyle Reese told Sarah Connor all she needs to know about the future he is from and the Terminator while he is driving her away from the Terminator. Arnold Schwarzenegger was worried that playing a villain would be terrible for his acting career, but he turned out to like playing the bad guy for once and he had the right body to play a strong robot who looked like a human. However, his one condition for James Cameron getting him back for Terminator 2 was that his T-800 character would become the hero protecting Sarah Connor from a new Terminator villain. In the 1-hour ""Other Voices"" documentary from the The Terminator DVD, I learned that Linda Hamilton really broke her ankle during filming, which meant all of her running scenes were filmed late in the schedule, and that made the peril of those moments feel even more real to me when I know why Sarah was having a hard time running away from a huge truck and carrying Kyle Reese at the same time.",

213,9 June 2015,geminiredblue,10, I'll Be Back!,"Over the years, James Cameron has made quite a name for himself. Especially in terms of ""sci-fi"" and ""action/ adventure"" movies. But long before TITANIC, AVATAR, and ALIENS, he came up with this original idea. In the not-too-distant future (now anyway), a nuclear war has taken place between the world superpowers. In the wake of the fallout, homicidal machines have risen up; attempting to exterminate the human race. In a desperate effort, the machines have built a time machine and sent a nearly-indestructible cyborg assassin, The Terminator (played icily by Arnold Schwarzenegger), back to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who will one day give birth to the leader of the human resistance. To protect her, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) a future soldier is sent back through time as well. Combining the best parts of horror, sci-fi, action, and crime drama, James Cameron keeps the movie going at a blistering pace without sacrificing the compelling (and necessary) human story.

True, if Ah-nuld had murdered the mother, then there never would have been a resistance leader to begin with, and the government wouldn't have seen any reason to send him back in time.

I went to see it because my youth group was talking about it and, as their Minister of Christian Education, and their youth leader, I was always interested in interacting with them about the media they consumed so I could challenge their worldview with the cause of Christ. I was completely astonished to fall in love with the love story that was, surprisingly, at the heart of this weird, mechanical, apocalyptic movie. It became one of my favourite movies and I've seen it multiple times since then and it still moves me.

I saw this movie and I realized that my mom would have killed me if she would have known what I had been watching in the theater playing this movie. I was used to the R rated blood lust from various Friday The 13th movies and therefore I had walked out of theaters with my friends in an uproar over the carnage. Not this time, my friends and I walked out as if we had seen the goriest snuff film ever made. However I don't want to give off the impression that this was a bad feeling, indeed we went back the next day to see it again! We would feel the same way after seeing Aliens.

310,9 July 2002,Angry_Arguer,10, Help saved sci-fi from Star Wars (spoilers),"Terminator deserves an award for the impact it made to sci-fi--albeit good and bad.  Star Wars demolished the genre that Kubrick slaved to change, making space operas more important than thinking at the box office.  With Terminator we abandon droids, galactic empires, the Force, and all that other pissant elementary school dung and get down to business, pronto. Many films are hailed ""cool"", but intellectuals get their brains working and reject is as garbage.  Terminator is one movie that'll please both smart & stupid, the darkness gives the sense of evil everywhere while an electronic score enhances the feeling of man at the mercy of machines.  Arnold, limited actor he is, reigns king of deadpan brutality.  When he puts a shotgun shell in someone's chest or rips their heart out--he doesn't smile, frown, or flinch, his performance is robotic--AND IT WORKS! The nightmarish future scenes make Mad Max look like Teletubbies (interesting how many set pieces were reused in T2).  While the futuristic Hunter-Killers seem fake, their machined ruthlessness causes fear. The cyborgs slay like Judas, betraying our emotions into believing only what's human, then whipping out the laser cannon and perforating us. As in almost all his work, James Cameron has women become strong.  Little is spent worrying with that and more on the story--making it one of the best low budget movies that does a lot with little.  In a 150 MILLION dollar film, do they care where the cash goes?  No, and we spectators wind up with ""Wild Wild West"", ""Pearl Harbor"", and ""Waterworld"" (not bold moves for the studios)!  In a $6 million film like this, togetherness is key. WARNING!  DON'T CONTEMPLATE HOW TELEPORTING IN TIME TO CHANGE THE PAST IN ORDER TO SAVE THE FUTURE WORKS!!

The rebirth of idea, is so rotten, that even the visual-effects is brand-new, the story is unpleasantly same. I just can't watch movie like that. Fortunately, I've found the era of idea treasure, it was in 1980's, the new beginning of action and science fiction. ""The Terminator"", is one of the first notable movie that defines its decade. It is somehow full of explosion, but still pay attention in its screenplay. Yeah, I know that the acting is not that good, but just be honest, the robot's acting, good or bad it is always the same. Don't mind the acting from the robot character, at least for this movie. A little awkward act don't break the entire movie, but there are other reasons that make it worth eight out of ten.

The movie that turned Arnie into an international star and director James Cameron a highly acclaimed director.The story is dark and disturbing.A nuclear holocaust is about to take place and the machines will take over.The only hope for the remaining human resistance against them is the still unborn leader John Connor.His mother Sara doesn't suspect that a machine called Terminator is sent from the future to assassinate her and prevent John's entire existence.To protect Sara the human resistance sends a man named Kyle Reese.But will he succeed against an enemy who seems unstoppable?And so a dangerous game of cat and mouse begins.There is a lot of action,chills but most importantly a great story ,something new and fresh for 1984 when the movie was released.Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn both give amazing performances and the audience feels what they are going through.But the real credit goes to Arnold himself who is absolutely stunning as the mean machine that kills everyone that gets in its way.He gets shot,burned,hit by a truck and blown up but just keeps coming back.A famous scene is when the Terminator goes into the police station after Sara and kills at least 20 cops in the process.One of the greatest things about the movie is the metal endoskeleton of the robot which looks like Death,covered in metal as Cameron describes it.Its totally terrifying and brutal.

His performance is completely dull, and I wish James Cameron put more thought into casting the hero.  You do want the hero to have SOME inkling of a personality.  Linda Hamilton's performance, though rusty at points, is pretty good.  It's also nice to see Paul Winfield, who I think I haven't seen since ""Cliffhanger."" Lance Henriksen is always cool to watch.  The storyline is thin and easy-to-follow.  It's nice to hear the premiere of Arnie's ""I'll be back"" line.  The film didn't send me leaping from my seat, but it's worth a look.

The plot is one immense paradox and you either love or hate the ultra-apocalyptic and sadistic theme of this film. But, even when you completely loathe the premise, you'll still always have to admit that The Terminator is one of the most imaginative scripts ever written. Dig this: the futuristic rulers of the world anno 2029 send back a robot in time, to the year 1984, with only one goal. Kill the mother of the great future freedom fighter before he's even born. And the father of this great hero is a soldier, sent after the cyborg, to prevent him from fulfilling his mission. If this isn't ingenious, nothing is! And, above this, The Terminator is a very diverse film as well. It's a shocking thriller (the hunt for Sarah Connor) as well as a dared, intense drama (the huge load of innocent victims).

335,12 June 2009,tburke85,7, Terminator A Good Sci-Fi Film With Some Flaws,"The Terminator is a good sci-fi film with some flaws but it does have a compelling story, plenty of action, character development, suspense, great special effects especially for that time, and solid performances by the whole cast. I did prefer T2 and most recently Terminator Salvation over this one but the original is still a good film. Writer/Director James Cameron the man behind films like Titanic, True Lies, Alien 2, and the upcoming Avatar showed a real talent as a filmmaker with this movie which was his second one back then. Cameron is one of the best writer/directors out there and he continues to prove just that with every one of his movies. The cast are great in their roles bringing to life these imaginary characters Cameron created for the film. Arnold Schwarzenegger is fantastic in the title role. He may not have many lines and his screen time is cut a little short near the end well sort of Schwarzenegger still proves to be an effective villain. He was born to play The Terminator a ruthless cyborg from the future that will stop at nothing until it's mission is complete. Michael Biehn is equally impressive as time traveler Kyle Reese from the future. He gets just as much screen time if not a little more than Schwarzenegger and Biehn makes the best of his role as the hero in the movie. He brings an intensity to his performance which makes his believable as a time traveler whose mission is to protect Sarah Connor played by Linda Hamilton. She's also very good in the role of Sarah an ordinary woman who must find the strength within herself to stop the Terminator before he kills her. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles but they're not given much to do and really any screen time to leave an impression. The whole story of the film would take me forever to fully explain so I'm not going to get into it. It's better to just watch the Terminator before knowing too much what the movie is about before any spoilers could ruin the experience. The action is pretty much non-stop making the film move at a steady pace as the main characters are introduced and the chase begins to get to Sarah Connor first. All the crashes, explosions, chases, fights, and narrow escapes are well executed most of them looking very realistic. The special effects are state of the art especially for movies back then considering they didn't have the technology available today. The few flashback sequences with Reese showing a post Judgment Day are just as good. The world is an apocalyptic wasteland overrun by machines bent on annihilating the human race. Despite some flaws with the dialogue occasionally, answered questions, and somewhat rushed love story although it had to happen or else John Connor wouldn't exist, The Terminator is still a solid sci-fi film. It's much better than other ones out there like Ultraviolet, Babylon A.D., or Aeon Flux to name a few no offense. Overall The Terminator is an entertaining sci-fi adventure definitely worth watching with plenty of action, great special effects, thrills, suspense, drama, some humor, a little romance, and terrific performances by the cast.",

In this movie I think the best scene is the final scene when they get in this factory (or whatever it is) and Terminator's after them. If you haven't watched it, do it immediately. Every movie made by James Cameron is top. 10/10",

342,30 April 2007,xredgarnetx,7, Scary sci-fi,"I first saw TERMINATOR on a hotel room TV in Washington, D.C., with my wife and young daughter. I would say the film thrilled the heck out of us and probably scared my kid half to death, but the fact is, we were in a brightly lit hotel room and the TV wasn't particularly large. I know we were bowled over by the police station sequence and the final chase at the very least. This is one of Ah-nuld's best roles, and director James Cameron knows how to keep things moving along on a shoestring budget. The scene where Ah-nuld must deal with a partially ruined face is unforgettable. T2 came along a few years later and put the original to shame, much like ALIENS did to ALIEN. But if it were not for THE TERMINATOR, where would we be today? A groundbreaking sci-fi thriller, loosely based on a TV program and very old short story, by the way, neither of which is credited, as I recall.",
343,8 July 2012,g_ryder,10, In the end the Terminator will triumph - that is the real terror of mankind,"The basic plot of the movie is that a highly sophisticated machine (The Terminator) with extraordinary physical powers that also looks like a human on the outside (Schwarzenegger) has been sent from the future to the present so that the machines can terminate the mother of the only person who can save the human species in the final war between humans and machines that rages in the future world. This is being done so that the 'savior of the human species' is never born, and with that done the machines of the future can win easily. The humans of the future come to know of this plan, and so they too send a human into the present time to stop the terminator from carrying out this plan. All the action revolves around this plot, and all the sequences are brilliantly choreographed, along with superb visual effects and dialogs. The role of Schwarzenegger is so perfectly fitting as 'The Terminator', that it is spooky. This has rightly earned him the nickname 'Terminator' of which he too is proud of. It is this spooky feeling that indicates that this is no simple sci-fi action movie, and that there runs beneath the surface theme of man versus machine, a more fundamental theme of life and death, of 'Eros' and 'Thanatos' than just action and adventure, and that is why this is a classic.",

There's lovely bits of character development littered through it as well, not in your face back story, just stuff that make the characters a bit more human (well bar Arnie obviously). I think what makes it such a great film is the fact that it doesn't rely on massive special effects to make it good. They really do play a back seat role, and the fact that it's just a really simple narrative makes it work very well. It's more of a violent game of cat and mouse, with a massively overshadowing sense of no hope. The plot is well thought out, and the characters are very believable. There's no doubt in my mind that Arnold Schwarzenegger is a terrible, terrible actor, but the thing about him in the Terminator series is that you just don't care. The main reason being is that he's playing a cyborg, and isn't supposed to show any emotion. I think what this film managed to do very well, which I think lacked in all the other films, is the genuinely chilling atmosphere. I think the soundtrack plays a really big part in this, it sounds like a violent, orchestrated game boy soundtrack. There's something just so fitting about it.",

Body builder Arnold Schwarzenegger virtually guaranteed that this 107 minute exercise in murder and mayhem would be a blockbuster with his villainous, straight-faced portrayal of a relentless cyborg that will allow nothing to stand between its programmed objective of executing a woman, Sarah Connor, in the past. The chief science fiction element in Cameron's film is the use of predestination paradox where it appears the history is being altered, when in fact, it is really being fulfilled. Cameron rehashed much of the ""Terminator"" action in the sequel, but he made the Schwarzenegger more sympathetic by having him serve as young John Connor's bodyguard. Ironically, this $6-million plus movie wasn't that original because cyborg characters have been around in fantasy literature as early as Edgar Allan Poe. Nevertheless, ""The Terminator"" put cyborgs on the map more than ""The Six-Million Dollar Man"" and eventually inspired the ""Robocop"" franchise.",

His prey, Sarah Connor played very well by Linda Hamilton.  The story is good and there is lots of action and excitement.  This one goes pretty quick too, unlike the second one which has places in it that drags a bit.  Of course it makes up for the slow parts by having better effects than this one.  This one has many memorable scenes, the most memorable being the Terminator's attack on the police station.  There are a couple of Cameron staples here as Michael Biehan and Lance Henrikson are in it.  They appear in other Cameron movies as well.  Bill Paxton even has a small role in this one.

381,2 October 2009,thesar-2,8, I'll Be Bare,"One of the most amazing aspects of 'The Terminator,' was the story. Despite the extremely low budget, and the equally low-budget feel of the film, the movie had an extremely well thought out story. This is evident when they took this film into three additional sequels, made a mega-star out of Schwarzenegger and even produced a short-lived TV series. Unfortunately, despite the quality of story and the sci-fi aspect of the plot line, I viewed it more as a horror story than an action picture it was meant to be. I think it was the genre of films produced back on and around 1984. Only this one stood out, with solid performances by Hamilton, Biehn and, of course, Schwarzenegger. In the defining movie based on man vs. machines (tell me the makers of 'The Matrix' wasn't thinking about this movie throughout), comes a 'Judgment Day' apocalyptic war when machines take over in 1997 and man spends the rest of his days fighting the mistake we made. Back in time comes a ""terminator"" to kill the mother of the resistance leader in a valid tactical move, but thankfully, the leader also sends someone back to protect her – giving us valuable information in the process. While some of the graphics (and hair, oh, God, the hair) were extremely dated (also see: the closing, when Schwarzenegger finally loses his skin), the movie holds up very well, even 25 years later. And it's all thanks to the interesting and original story as well as the acting. Many imitated this movie; none came close to the heart of 'The Terminator.' I even loved the ending. Of course, it opened the doors to sequels, but if it ended with the storm coming, it would've been okay. They produced a quality product that honestly didn't need a continuation.",

397,19 August 2008,kyle-cruse,9, Classic,"""The Terminator"" is a classic 80s action movie. Yes, it's a bit cheesy, the special effects are obviously fake now, and there isn't a huge amount of character development in this film, but it's still the best of this series, in my opinion. This is considered to be a low budget film, as most of the stars were unknowns at the time. Now that Arnold Schwarzeneggar is a huge star (as well as governor), the film can be looked at somewhat as the beginning of a career. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is rescued from the Terminator by Kyle Reese, a man from the future who knows that Connor's son John will lead the rebellion against the takeover by robots in the future. The rest of the film consists of the two of them trying to escape this Terminator and the events that will result in John Connor's birth. It's still a great film, and the best of this series so far, even though it doesn't have great visual effects. There are good performances from the entire cast, and there are tons of humorous bits throughout the film that lighten up such a suspenseful, frightening story. ""Terminator 2"" is an impressive sequel, but because I feel it is overly violent, I'm not going to rate it higher than this film.",

I was surprised that they made me care about the characters as much as they did (don't get me wrong, I was never completely invested in them, just decently invested in them) and that there was never a time I found the dialogue to be cringey. Sarah Conner was a very likeable character that was very easy to root for, you could always tell what she was feeling and thinking, and I wanted her to succeed, I wanted her to live. She wasn't some generic ""damsel-in-distress,"" though she kind of came across that way for a bit in the movie, but she learned to do things on her own as the movie went on, which I'm glad for.

Moments later ""Kyle"" (Michael Biehn) arrives with the aim of thwarting this dastardly plan - and soon the race is on. Meanwhile, ""Sarah"" (Linda Hamilton) is blissfully unaware that she is a target until the news bulletins start reporting the brutal slaying of her namesakes. She is spooked, and takes refuge in a night club while the city's finest head to her rescue. Thing is, Arnie is not just a big muscly bloke, he's a big muscly killing machine - and a nigh-on immortal one at that. ""Kyle"" and ""Sarah"" now have their work cut out just to stay alive while they try to concoct a plan that will destroy her nemesis before it destroys them - and pretty much everyone else it comes into contact with! Aside from the synthesiser music - which has dated quite badly - this film still holds up as a solid and entertaining sci-fi horror film. True, the script is never top of James Cameron's priorities, and here is no different, but the pace of the film and the sparing but effective use of the special effects build to quite an exciting crush-endo that is good to watch with a surprising degree of jeopardy right until the very end.

Anyone who prefers the kinder, gentler Terminator over the monster that Arnold portrays here is a person with quite different tastes than mine.

The plot doesn't holdup too well on scrutiny, but that's why it's called science fiction. Arnold makes one of filmdom's meanest villains and gets to utter one of his famous lines, ""I'll be back."" Biehn is likable as the hero and Hamilton makes a lovely damsel in distress. Cameron, working with a small budget in only his second feature film as director, keeps the action moving at a break-neck pace as the tension mounts.

417,24 May 2009,poe426,10, The Outer Limits redux...,"When I saw this one in 1984, I couldn't help but point out that it was nothing new: anyone who's seen THE OUTER LIMITS (the original, black and white series) can attest to that. THE TERMINATOR ""borrows liberally"" from at least three episodes: THE MAN WHO WAS NEVER BORN, SOLDIER, and DEMON WITH A GLASS HAND. The latter two episodes were both written by noted Fantasist Harlan Ellison. He would sue the filmmakers for plagiarism and win. (When the movie played theaters, the ""acknowledgement to the works of Harlan Ellison"" did NOT appear at the end of the movie.) Cameron and company took the romance between Martin Landau and the soon-to-be mother of the man who would bring about the end of civilization from THE MAN WHO WAS NEVER BORN and coupled it, if you will, with the time-traveling title character from SOLDIER (brilliantly played by Michael Ansara) and the Mandroid (another brilliant performance, by Robert Culp) from DEMON WITH THE GLASS HAND. Focusing more on action than anything else (though it's Michael Bien's passionate performance as the hero that makes the movie worth watching), THE TERMINATOR proved the perfect vehicle for Arnold Schwarzenegger: he says little, but is physically imposing enough to intimidate anyone he comes into contact with. The fx were good enough for their time (and still hold up on the small screen) and the music is unforgettable.",

For the Machines to win, they send back a killer robot to kill Sarah Connor, who will mother a child named John, who in turn will grow up and one day lead The Resistance against the Machines. With her dead, no John, and the Machines win. So Man sends a man back in time (apparently, 10 years from now, in 2029, we'll be able to time travel) to stop The Terminator so John can be born. The story holds up nicely, but the action sequences have been done to death so many times since, they don't fare as well. Yet the movie manages to give you the feeling that the studio had no part in the creative process, and let them just make their little movie. Here's $6 mil, Jimmy, go out and play. I just read that James Cameron had the image of the metallic skeleton killer robot first, and worked backwards from there. And because of budget constrictions (he couldn't have a future that looked all that good, in the movie, not in real life), so he made it a time travel story so he can shoot in present day.

445,21 May 2020,fernandoschiavi,8," ""The Terminator"" is, without a doubt, a modern landmark in science fiction cinema and, why not, a cinematographic landmark independent of genres","""The Terminator"" is, without a doubt, a modern landmark in science fiction cinema and, why not, a cinematographic landmark independent of genres, alongside other works of the size of ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"", the classic ""Star Wars"" trilogy. Behind an unprecedented and even frightening concept - of a future dominated by machines - mainly if transported to the current reality in which technology increasingly assumes new roles in people's daily lives. The work of visionary James Cameron, who wrote the script alongside Gale Ann Hurd (another visionary) who was responsible for the final format of the work - there were two Terminators from the future, one made of liquid metal, which was cut to reduce costs and then famously reused in the sequel. This film was one of the first to present the perfect balance between action and pure science fiction (not fantasy as is the case with Star Wars), challenging definitions and the barriers of the genre. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, it demonstrates that creativity and inventiveness will always, under any circumstances, be able to overcome budget constraints.
The script is a master of narrative economy and deceptive simplicity. It is a masterpiece of efficiency to convey very interesting concepts about time travel and the resulting paradoxes. In the same way, without resorting to much exposure (some is necessary and inevitable), we learn details about the painful life of Kyle Reese (Biehn), soldier of the future who is sent to the past to protect Sarah Connor from a cyborg sent by the machines to kill the mother of the future leader of the rebellion against the machines. While rejecting the cyborg attacks, Kyle is guiding not only Sarah, but us spectators as well, through the bases that support the film. For example, Cameron intelligently makes him tell a good part of the details of the future in an interrogation to the police, a simple exposition that gives us the necessary knowledge about the gears that move tomorrow. Gradually, we realize that Kyle will have an importance beyond the protection of Sarah's life, as he will play another key role in the war against Skynet. In these few exhibition scenes, it is possible to convey the whole idea of a dark future caused by a nuclear war, and which is dominated by machines, which take humans to extermination camps. The first infiltrated robots had rubber skin and were easy to identify, but then more real skins, blood and everything were made to make them more human, so dogs had to be used to identify them. It still shows the remaining humans living hidden, underground, dirty, hungry (even rats are eating to survive), with John Connor his only hope. We see Reese's past (or would it be the future?) In flashbacks (or flash-forwards, if you look at it chronologically) perfectly stitched into the plot and visually inserted by Cameron with original and smooth transitions, now as a dream, now as a ""bedtime story"".",

James Cameron's first movie sets the perfect tone for his later work. Arnold Schwarzenegger is , even tough he doesn't say much, the best aspect of this film. You can feel the stakes and I love the time travelling love triangle paradox. This movie feels like a practice for Aliens which is even more awesome than this movie. The neo-noir technique gives this grimm and dark tone that fits perfectly with this movie. So if you want a good 80's action sci-fi classic, i suggest you check this one out.",

461,15 April 2017,pc95,7, Dated Music But Still Good,"""The Terminator"" is director James Cameron's big ticket into the world of film, and rightfully so. He's put together an interesting, partly paranoid, gritty survival Sci-Fi Action mesh that ought to be rated highly given the apparent modest budget. While lead actress Linda Hamilton's gives a soft and maybe somewhat uneven performance, Cameron scores largely due to choosing Schwarzenegger for the lead villain. An article states Cameron was against casting Arnold initially, but the planned rejection-meeting changed and reversed his mind, and the rest is history. The action in the movie fairly competent. Perhaps the most interesting aspect is the back-story which is a great setup and give the movie some depth. Rewatching it, I hadn't seen in it in 15 years, but it is still a good watch minus the scene-cutover music which doesn't stand the test of time and makes and dates it sounding circus- like and cartoonish. You can forgive this though. Note Michael Biehn does solid job in supporting role. Recommended Sci-Fi, and certainly for Arnie fans -- 7/10.",

Arnold shows his prowess as the Terminator, a man sent from the future to kill Sarah Connor, played by Linda Hamilton (who reprises her role in the sequel). Kyle Reese, played by Michael Beihn, is also sent from the future, this time to prevent her and her future son.

471,1 October 2017,mike48128,9, The Story Always Seemed so Familiar-A Guilty Pleasure!,"Somewhat plagiarized and cliché. Another monster-chase movie with a science fiction twist. The scenes from the near-future are understated yet effective. It's kind of low budget as there are only a handful of ""extras"" and a few killer machines shown at a time. The matte paintings seem very ""static"". Almost non-stop action for most-of-the-time and Arnold has the time-of-his-life annihilating everything in sight, except the right Sarah Connor and her real big dog. Young Arnold is in incredible physical shape. Warning: ""cheeky"" male nudity and one female topless shot during obligatory ""copulation"". Overly bloody and violent? Sure. Do all ""action"" movies have to have an exploding gasoline tanker? (yes) I have always considered this to be the ""prequel"" for Terminator 2, which I like far better. It's a real ""Ying and Yang"". Here Mr. Muscles is too mean and in #2 he's a bit too nice. I have yet to see all the sequels that follow, as I suspect it's like ""Star Wars"" with it's many unoriginal and similar story-lines? Stan Winston Studios crafted a great Terminator ""puppet"" and the slight amount of stop-motion animation does not deter the overall effect.

For Sarah Conner it's just an outlandish nightmare that won't end, and she goes through an understandable range of emotions: hysteria, incredulity, anger and affection for her protector before reaching down inside herself and finding the resolve to end her ordeal.

1. There are numerous earlier films with better special effects e.g. Alien, Star Wars & Empire Strikes Back.
2. The story line is ridiculous. TIME TRAVEL EVEN IF POSSIBLE WOULD MEAN TIME IS CIRCULAR WITH NO BEGINNING OR END, OR THE TRAVELER TO THE PAST CREATES AN ALTERNATE TIME CONTINUUM. THOSE ARE THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE HYPOTHETICAL FICTIONAL REALITIES. WHY WOULD IT BENEFIT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN 2049 TO PREVENT THE LEADER OF THE RESISTANCE FROM BEING BORN? JUST CONTINUE KILLING THE HUMANS NOW!!!
3. THERES NO BEGINNING OR END? HOW CAN YOU BE ALIVE TO SEND SOMEONE INTO THE PAST WHO UNTIL HE IS YOUR BIOLOGICAL FATHER. THAT MEANS TIME IS AN INFINITE LOOP AND FUTURE AND PAST ARE RELATIVE AND ITS DUMB.

The Plot: A machine from the future is sent back in time to kill the mother of the future resistance leader John Conner. A soldier is sent back in time to protect her. But it turns out that he not only protects her, he is the father of the future resistance leader. The first Terminator film is a classic. It doesn't make my favorites list, but it's sequel does. From the minute you see Arnold Swartzenegger on the screen, you know he was on roids.The other films I don't think he was. I don't like this one as much because I prefer the liquid guy as a villain over him. Arnold Swatzenegger isn't meant to be playing a villain in a film. He's always the hero.

495,9 October 2001,stamper,8, Great classic,"This is truly a great film, which of course is always somehow compared with part two, just as part two is always compared to this one. Sure this one has it's advantages over the second one, but it also is a bit worse at times. But those times are not as frequent or as important as the many times it has advantages over the second installment, because everything that is worse in this film, over the second one has to do with special effects. Now listen closely, the effects are not bad, they are as good as they were in 1984, but they just are not as good as the effects in 1991 and that is it. Regarding the rest of the film, it sure as hell is somewhat better than the sequel. First of all, everything in this film is more original and fresh (because it is a first of course), but not only that. One thing I like a bit more in this film, is that it is darker you know, more mechanic and inhuman. You really get a sense here of the fact that you are dealing with an emotionless machine. All this dark sphere that is created must be ascribed mainly to James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger. James Cameron, of course for his vision and execution of the way he felt the music and the sets had to be and Schwarzenegger for his good performance. I know that many people may well argue about my last statement: 'Good performance, Schwarzenegger can't play CRAP!' Well in terms of great character roles or dramatic ones this might all be very true, but in this film Schwarzenegger captured everything his character was about perfectly. You might say he didn't have to act at all. But you go ahead, try to pass as a machine in a movie, kill emotionless, walk static, look grim, speak slowly and well 'machinery' (cut off). All of this enables the viewer to totally believe that he is indeed a machine.",

The Terminator is Cameron's first major film, and he couldn't of done any better. The Terminator is an all-around better sci-fi action film equipped with great direction, brilliant storytelling, and high caliber acting from Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, and, of course, Arnold. Arnold. Arnold. That's right, use your Austrian accent. Arnold. I love, Arnold. Arnold, Schwarzenegger was the strongest selection on planet Earth to become the Terminator. Arnold is the Terminator. The Terminator launches Schwarzenegger's career into unprecedented superstardom. The Terminator is Schwarzenegger's most iconic role. ""I'll be back."" Linda Hamilton, too, is literally the best woman in the world to be Sarah Conner. She was born to play Sarah, and she has earned it. Michael Biehn has the star strength of a soldier. Biehn's tough to replace as Kyle Reese, the man sent back in time 50 years from the future on a succeed at all costs mission to protect Sarah Connor, the mother of her unborn child, John Connor, who is the leader of the human resistance against the machines far into the future, and yep, you guessed it, the machines sent back Arnold the Terminator to Sarah Connor's time to hunt her and kill her. The Terminator has a timeless battle of resourceful human soldier, Kyle Reese, vs. unstoppable killing machine, the Terminator. The Terminator has an innovative and groundbreaking story for its time. The Terminator is high conceptual cinema that's powerfully dramatic and happens to be a bit scary at times. Bill Paxton plays his role for the time making for more classic Cameron. One thing that really makes the Terminator special, that you wouldn't have known at the time, is that its sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, is one of the all-time 50 best movies, and easily in the conversation of being the best sci-fi fantasy adventure, along with a few other Cameron greats, like Avatar, Aliens and The Abyss. T2 improves in all the right areas where T1 is minorly lacking. The Terminator very much feels like one extended and incomplete preview, yet, outstanding outing of the soon to be conceived and released, T2.

501,8 April 2013,benfield-larry09,9, Among the Best,The Terminator launched an era of sci-fi action and endless copy cats that never lived up to the originals. The film sets a lone soldier Kyle Reese who is sent back through time to protect a woman Sarah Connor who has a important destiny in the future. His opponent is a half human half machine programmed to kill Sarah at all cost. The film is both quite violent yet blends a romantic story within it's plot that is touching and central to the story. For a film of the middle 1980's the visual effects are still good yet somewhat dated but when this film first appeared they were amazing. Stan Winston was a master of animatronics and makeup effects and his work shines here. Arnold Schwarzenegger comes off well as the emotionless machine and is well balanced by Micheal Biehn's passionate Reese. Linda Hamilton completes the trio and does solid acting as a confused and scared Sarah Connor who finds her world and reality crumbling as the film progresses toward it's conclusion. This film defined Arnold as action star and coined one of the most well known one liners in Hollywood history.,

Lacks the comedy that was gradually introduced in the sequel and taken to ridiculous levels in the terrible 3rd movie. But I think the more serious approach is what appeals to me about Schwarzenegger's first outing as the T101. He plays a brutal relentless killer, emotionless and satisfyingly true to the MO of a terminator. The special effects are of the era. But the movie hits so many good notes that it's easy to overlook the'hi tec' prosthetic's of 1984. Great movie. A Classic.",

It's fast, has cool story, action sequences and even cooler antagonist. I don't remember why I gave it 9/10 in the first place and not 10/10.

Kyle Reese is a great protagonist alongside Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor. She is very natural and her reactions to the situation she finds herself in are spot on.

516,2 May 2007,Isaac5855,8, An Instant Sci-Fi Classic that put both its star and its director on the map...,"THE TERMINATOR was a non-stop, slam bang action classic that established James Cameron as a director to watch and established Arnold Schwarzenegger as a superstar. Schwarzenegger plays a cyborg from the future who has been sent back in time to the year 1984 to assassinate a woman whose son grew up to be great military leader whose enemies want to wipe out his entire existence by killing his mother. This film was a smash hit at the box office and became an instant classic. Cameron has mounted an exciting and riveting story that redefined the action genre forever. Linda Hamilton (who later became Mrs. James Cameron) delivers a star-making performance as Sarah Conner, the ordinary woman who is completely baffled as to why she has become a target for termination. Michael Beihn is sexy and charismatic as the soldier from the future who has also been sent back to stop the terminator and protect Sarah. Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen garner some chuckles as police trying to protect Sarah and there's an early albeit brief appearance by a young Bill Paxton as an early victim of the terminator. If you're an action fan whose never seen this, it's a must. Followed by a sequel called TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY.",

520,21 February 2000,Lord Tal,10, One of the All Time Greats.,"We all know the story, so i wont bore you on that. What i want to say is this, the Terminator is a timeless classic that is often overlooked due to its far poorer and yet far well known sequel that, from my point of view, should never have been created, if it were to be so infinitely inferior compared to The Terminator. The Terminator could well have just turned into a B-movie, but didnt. The great thing about it is how right from the start to the very end of the music (another brilliant thing about it), it has you at the edge of your seat, your attention never waivers, and no matter how many times you watch it, it just gets better and better. The music is, to put it bluntly, almost the best. The only music in a film that is better is that of The Last of the Mohicans. From my point of view, the music of a film is more important than the dialogue and visuals of a film, and after the first time i watched The Terminator, that music has stuck in my mind ever since (and im glad for it !). The other reasons that The Terminator is so good is its characters. Arnold Schwarzenegger is at his very best in this film, and i still think he has never managed to top this performace. Granted, he said less than 100 words or something, but that doesnt matter. The music and his actions when he was on screen defied any dialogue, and the less he talked, the better he was. The scene in the technoir club and the Police Station ""incident"" are two of the greatest scenes ever. Linda Hamilton was brilliant as the innocent waitress who's boring every day life, being continuously stood-up, suddenly turns into the most important living being on earth. Finally, there is Michael Biehn. Now i thought that Linda should have been catapulted into super stardom, when she wasnt, but Michael Biehns' luck in Hollywood is evan worse. He pulls off a performance that i dont think any other actor could have done. From my point of view, he was perfect. He had the greatest lines and the best character in all the film. You can really feel pity for this guy to say the least, as he seems so small compared to the massive bulk of Arnold, and yet just as Arnold keeps on getting up after being shot up, for a human, Riece does very well, showing the urgency and importance of his misson, as he must succeed. Michael Biehn gets no where near enough credit for this film, and instead of being in the Hollywood A List, hes way down the line. When it came out in the Cinemas', i watched The Rock, it had Sean Connery and Michael Biehn in it, i thought that both of them would have pivotal parts, and was hugely disappointed too see him die almost immediately after less time on screen than Ray Parkes in TPM. This guy really has been literally dumped on. Finally, James Cameron, for a guy who made the most expensive film ever, i have one piece of advice, get back to low budgets, cause this is the best film you've ever made and are ever likely to make. So, in conclusion, if anybody out there hasnt watched this film, watch it, its one of the best.",

The film is still excellent. It is a clever, thought provoking, suspense action thriller. It is a Science Fiction fans dream.

Everybody knows that; and just a quick glance through the comments of IMDB users is enough to convince anyone that that is the majority view. But why? Surely any hulking brute could have filled the role just as amply? Answer - no. Arnie wasn't just born to play a cyborg because he had a pneumatic physique. On the contrary, it's his robotic austrian grasp of English, his total physical stiffness, and his face redolent of a Barbie Doll ""Ken"" on anabolic steroids that do it. In 1986, the real Arnie was little more than an android himself - so unwieldy that he'd had to tone down his workout for 'Conan' simply so as to be able to swing a sword comfortably. It's one reason why the play's most grating 'special effect' (the moquette head used to conduct the eye operation) paradoxically doesn't grate that much: it may look like bad Harryhausen; but then again so does Schwarzenegger.",

You get corny one liners that are still in use by the general public for comedic purposes, you get the bullets and explosion action, and you get a solid plot all packed into one film. There's not much to dislike with the film except for that the effects are a bit dated, but not for it's time of production and that doesn't change how good of a movie it still is. As most of you reading this already know, this is the movie that everyone familiarizes Arnold Schwarzenegger with. According to IMDb, Schwarzenegger even stated that ""the Terminator is a defining work in my career"" and most of us couldn't agree more. This movie was also nominated for 6 awards and won 8 awards which to me seems a little underwhelming.

540,20 October 1999,PeachHamBeach,10," Violent, Gory, Metallic, Raw and Surprisingly Touching and Humanistic","Although I loved TITANIC as much as anyone,  THE TERMINATOR is my favorite James Cameron movie.  It was raw,  gritty,  violent and although it has its own technological wonders,  they are far fewer than the ones in Cameron's newer movies,  and I liked the lack of frills.  This story about a woman running for her life from a futuristic cyborg programmed to assassinate her is more human than technological.  I hope that Cameron never loses that quality because I've always admired it and noticed it in every one of his films from THE TERMINATOR to ALIENS to THE ABYSS to T2 to TITANIC.  There's lots of special effects,  but he never fails to breathe life into his human characters.  I am like a lot of people,  I really like Michael Biehn and every movie I've ever seen with him in it.  He never gets the kind of attention he deserves,  and this early role of Kyle Reese,  the human soldier who risked ultimately everything to travel over time to help protect Sarah Connor,  was the first nuanced hint of his amazing talent and is still my favorite role of his.  And I'm certainly glad I'm not strange for thinking that the brief love affair that the two had was a touching and fitting though very surprising ingredient to the story.  To me, the talk that they have about the bleakness and pain that Reese knows is in the future and the sudden and unexpected discovery of their love is making a subtle,  yet profound statement,  like saying hope in the stead of hopelessness,  life in the place of lifelessness,  and joy and love in the place of hate and violence and pain. Okay,  I'm corny,  but this movie really did leave me with the corniness you read.  And last but not least,  Arnold Schwarzenegger as the huge,  ammoral killer,  a real treat,  the icing on the cake,  and my favorite lines: ""Twelve guage auto loadah...Phase plasma rifle with a forty watt range...uzi nine millimetah!!!""  : )",

There is an unstoppable, inhuman threat out there that won't stop until it devours its prey. It's certainly much less bombastic than any of its sequels, and while I don't personally like it as much as ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"", one can't deny the charm and captivating nature of the original movie.

If you were to see it, there's no way you could of imagined that it was made in 1984.  Camereon's first real classic.  Michael Biehn I thought stole the show with his performance as Kyle Reese.  Sarah Hamilton also gives the performance of her career and Arnold delivers an outstanding performance in the few memorable lines that he gives.  The Terminator delivers not only a action packed, explosive thrill ride, but also a very emotional heart warming scene involving Biehn and Hamilton.  This will forever be the most memorable film I've ever experienced.",

This is one of the most usual setting for science fiction and the most common of that variety is the post-apocalyptic future, in which all things more or less goes to hell and humans have to survive in the wreckage of our fallen civilization. Now there have been many interpretations of that kid over the years in books, television series, comic books and most prominently in films. ",
570,16 May 2020,TheHoodOfSwords,8, Classic Action Film,"So I kind of did a double feature that worked incredibly well. War games and then this movie. Both are really about humanity and machine. I've heard the sequel is better then the first on this franchise, but I went into this with admittedly pretty high expectations. The movie delivers on the Sci-Fi thriller and crime story pretty well. The casting of Arnold is amazing and for the most part the special effects don't hamper it. Parts of it are supposed to be a bit tongue and cheek and I think it's done pretty well. The romance gets a bit strange but it isn't front and centre so much that you notice it too much. I found all the action and chase scenes to be pretty damn cool. I do think the world could have been built up a bit more. Since the story is all about the world being so bad they have to send a Terminator back to that humans never take over. We get a bit of development of it later on but it's not a whole amount. Still, super solid great action Sci-Fi movie with some great lines and even a bit of comedy.",

However, I can't deny that it aged pretty badly. It's still quite entertaining as it's fast-paced, straight to the point and with a good atmosphere, but everything has been made better in other films. The Terminator character has been built around Arnold Schwarzenegger's stiffness and inexpressiveness, and it works great for this film. He should have been a bad guy for the whole franchise.",

Relentless action and well thought out plot and excellent cinematography, and acting help to make this one of the classic violent, sci-fi movies of all time. It is dated in a non bad way on certain effects and with the synthesizer soundtrack; (which i love and think it adds to the atmosphere of the movie, even from the opening credits. Perhaps it is effective because it is machine made and therefore emphasis the emotionless quality behind the Terminator.) Suspense is kept up through the entire movie especially picking up during the dance club scene as you wonder how the Terminator can just keep coming at you. Arnold truly portrayed the Terminator as an emotionless (in a good way) automoton bent on completing the mission at all cost. The actors have wonderful chemistry and were cast well including the psychiatrist and the police officers. It is fun to watch the heroine and hero grow through the movie as other posters have said.

I've seen it for seven or eight times before this. So when I sat before my TV to watch it again, just a day after I saw T3 in theatre, it gave me a new idea. That the Terminator (1984) never meant to be a sci-fi eye candy based on raw action, which T2 and more precisely T3 have become. It should be classified into some sci-fi horror to be more perfect. That creepy Terminator model, that gory look of Schwarzenegger, the night based story and especially that background music--- all meant to create a feeling of horror or dark thriller, never a die-hard action flick. I don't know if seeing this film in the perspective of that era, early 80's, could tell a different thing. But to be an action movie in today's eyes, Terminator is not sufficient.",

596,8 February 2021,Jackblyth8,10, Nothing Quite Like It,"In 1984, visual effects and CGI weren't as extensive as they are today. The advanced cinematography films matching 'The Terminator' were the likes of 'Raiders of the Lost Dark' and 'Return of the Jedi'. Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger star in the eerie thriller, begging the questions about the possibility of time-travel and how you can change the past to affect the future. The film begins in 1984, a cyborg assassin named the Terminator (Schwarzenegger) arrives from 2029 in the search for Sarah Conner. Kyle Reese also appears from the same year, sent as a human soldier to protect the Terminator's target. The Terminator murders all women named Sarah Conner, failing to find his prey. Fearful that she is being followed, Linda Hamilton's character calls the cops and hides in a night club where Kyle and shortly after the Terminator are both situated. After an outbreak of gunshot fires, Kyle escapes with Sarah as the Terminator chases them in a stolen police car. Hiding in a car park, Kyle explains to Sarah that an artificial intelligence defence network, known as Skynet and created by Cyberdyne systems, will become self-aware in the future and initiate a nuclear holocaust. Sarah's future son John rally's the resistance troops as a leader, guiding them to victory and on the verge of destroying the defence network. Shortly before their destruction, Skynet sent the Terminator to prevent the arise of Sarah's future son. The Terminator, a cyberdyne system model 101, is an efficient killing machine killing machine with a powerful metal endoskeleton, and an eternal layer of living tissue that makes it appear human. Kyle and Sarah are apprehended by the police, ridiculing Kyle for his explanation. They keep Sarah in the office away from the ruthless Terminator. The famous line ""I'll be back"" is performed by Schwarzenegger shortly before driving into the station and killing many officers. Kyle escapes from his entrapment with Sarah and drive a stolen car to a motel where they obtain pipe bombs and plan their next actions. Kyle opens up about his love towards Sarah stating he fell for her ever since he saw a picture of her carried by John. Sarah reciprocated his feelings by kissing the soldier, leading to the pair having sex. The Terminator kills Sarah's mother, impressively impersonating Sarahs's mother's voice, Terminator attempts to contact her via telephone. When they realise the Terminator has located them, they escape in a pickup truck while it chases them on a motorbike. While launching numerous pipe bombs at the Terminator, Kyle is wounded by a gunfire. Furious, Sarah throws the Terminator off his motorbike but loses control of the truck which flips over. The Terminator, now bruised and badly damaged, hijacks a tank truck and attempts to run down Sarah, but, Kyle slips a pipe bomb inside the tank truck's hose tube, causing a colossal explosion that burns the human flesh off from the Terminator's endoskeleton. It pursues them into a factory, a struggling Kyle activates the machinery to confuse the Terminator. The robot-looking assassin confronts the pair, however fails to affect them as Kyle places another pipe bomb into its abdomen, blowing it apart, killing itself and injuring Sarah in the process. The relentless machine's torso reactivates and grabs the injured Sarah, who stretches to break free and operate the hydraulic press, to crush and destroy the last parts of the cyborg. Months later, a pregnant Sarah parks up at a gas station while travelling through Mexico, recording tapes to pass on to her unborn son, John. A boy takes an instant photo of Sarah in return for some cash, she buys it - the same photograph that John will give to Kyle. A great concept on the basis that the present can change greatly with one small change to the past. Gripping and electrifying - 'The Terminator' - ends on a fitting suspense, what is next for Sarah Connor. Winning the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film, it is a quality spectacle, keeping you on edge throughout. A true classic.",

By now, I have lost count of how many times I've viewed this horror science fiction classic. But one thing is sure, it will never fail to amaze and shock (especially for new viewers it would make a real treat), standing the test of time as one of the cinema's most popular and successful trilogies, and for me, most favorite! I have to confess I enjoy T2 Judgment Day as well, but it kind of drags in the middle and the violence isn't as ferocious, partly maybe because John Conner is still a kid then. But in T1, it's a roller coaster, full-blown ride of non-stop action with not a single boring moment, every scene is crucial to the story and the violence is bared for all to see the kind of urgent and desperate situation our heroes are in.",

Despite improvements in CGI, etc., the mesmerizing force of the titanium endoskeleton wrapped in synthetic tissue still causes the sci-fi fanatic in me to rejoice! It is also refreshing to see that no film has touched upon the idea of sending an agent back in time to destroy the creator of the future as well as this film does. Not only did this film come off as a huge success, but the following two sequels fell into place in a satisfying way. I can see that this film will continue to grow in its cult status over the years, based on its simplicity, thrills and suspense, and sheer action value. I've GOT to get the entire collection of all three films someday, so I won't have to ""stumble"" upon it by chance on a movie channel.",

Arnold was perfectly cast as were the rest of this cracking cast. Fear is a hard thing to generate in a movie and this one had it in bucket loads! Definitely one of the best science fiction films of the '80s. Arnie's lack of dialog was a brilliant idea. His sole reasons for being there were made obvious by this. No nonsense prattle which I believe ruins movies. Watch the sequels to see what I mean. Fantastic movie, a must see. The only complaint I have is why oh why were sequels made. Usually sequels are made to enhance the original. Not so in this case. Have only just seen the cuts which were on the bonus disc. Oh wow. They really set it up for the sequel.

The exposition is great. The story develops quickly and each character is different. Unlike most action films we aren't given a character who goes nowhere, Sarah Connor (Hamilton) develops into the strong woman we see in the second film during the course of this film. The T-101 is acted well by Schwarzenegger, and before you say anyone can act like a robot know this; Schwarzenegger came up with most of the ways the T-101 moved. When he is searching for Kyle Reese (Biehn) and Sarah he moves his eyes and then his head giving him the resemblance of a surveillance camera. It's little things like that which gives his performance a little bit of extra weight. Michael Biehn is believable as Kyle Reese and takes the part very seriously and it paid off for the film. The special effects are excellent for such a low budget film and the dark look adds to the intensity that the film already carries. The music isn't typical Hollywood either it is always complimenting the danger the characters are facing. This is a fantastic film, a must see movie for everyone. Only one flaw and which is that in one scene the stop-motion isn't very good, but other than that perfect.",

Arnie was born to do this role. Michael was a perfect hero and James was the only to pull it out, by his standards. Arnie had a very small amount of lines but more-less all of them are memorable. From ""i'll be back"" to his multiply options of answers while repairing his face damage. Even Reese's one-liners like ""Come with me if u want 2 live"" are legendary. And our main hero dies. I mean in how many movies nowadays this happen? I was always against any syrupy happy-endings but this one is just about perfect. What about that picture at the end? The beginnings of this masterpiece might be in some other classics like ""Blade runner"" or ""Mad Max"", than Cameron definitely borrowed from ""Westworld"", but somehow he managed to create his own space. There are countless books written about it and there will always be a debate which one is better T1 or T2? For me personally after more than 10000 movies seen there are just a few with 10 points. Terminator is one of them.Star Wars, Matrix and Alien come up to the near second in sci-fi section but ""I'll be back!"" rules. Still after more than 20 years it is not dated or outlived.

Arnold Shwartznegger was great as The Terminator, this movie shot him to superstardom. I loved Terminator 2: Judgement day and I liked T3:rise of the machines to a certain extent but none of the sequels had the same impact the original had on me.

620,28 June 2020,Svenstadt,9," Almost perfect, often imitated gem in sci-fi.","This film is nearly perfection. Much grittier than all other later installments (perhaps because it was the 80's). The only problem I have with it is that in recent years, there's been a trend in remastering the soundtracks. I can't tell you how much this annoys me! It ruins the entire feel of the movie. If a movie was made in the 80's, it should not be redubbed. It should be true to its proper place. Just imagine if ""It's a wonderful life"" had been remastered!! ""What a weird movie that is,"" everyone would say. Arnold's brand of acting, however, was the main let-down in the movie. For a person who said he tried to ""become the machine,"" he had some moments where he let his guard down, both in this installment and in T2. For example, when he is repairing the battle damage, he brushes his hair briefly, and you can see a minor smirk on his face. Can't hide the humanity. Arnold can't really act much without his subtle cockiness and muscle-confidence. As he aged, he started starring in worse and worse movies like ""Collateral Damage."" He is now just a sad, limp, old Austrian Wurst, unfortunately for him. The art department was the major let-down in this one, which was far superior in T2. You can tell that some of the vehicles and other things are almost like cardboard cut-outs or something. The battle damage repair scene was oh-so-obviously not Arnold but a cheap mold of his face.",

I have seen both films more times than is good for me and I rank the original as being far superior. The second one feels very Hollywood, like it was made by a bunch of businessmen. The first one was done for no reason other than to make a great film. This is refreshing in this day and age, and the film carries it off perfectly.",

623,30 March 2010,ochoamanuel21,10, A Masterpiece,"This movie is every bit as good as the second one in its own rights, first of all it does not feel outdated since the movie is set in the 1980s so it fits and the future flashbacks are awesome- Kyle Reese is awesome too and also and in my opinion this T-850 is more relentless than the T-1000 since he does not hesitate in the kills- the T-1000 is still awesome and sleeker but the T-850 is more threatening in this movie. This film is violent, grim, and with a glimmer of hope with Reese and Connor, the way is supposed to be. Not to mention Brad Fiedel's metallic score matches the film perfectly as a Tech-Noir film. Sarah's evolution from a lowly waitress to the mother of the leader of the human resistance is believable. This film also has lots of backstory relating to the Terminator franchise and is essential to view for any Terminator fan out there.",

625,2 September 2020,meissotruey,5, I'm confused a bit (Director's Cut Review),"I start with cons, cause there are too many. During watching i felt indifference. I didn't spent any time with each of characters(i don't really know them) so how can i be with them, share their emotions? All we know and see is kinda formal, Kyle emotional speech(on nature, in the morning) feels like outta nowhere. And also this 2 minute instant love looks strange. I can't relate to Sarah also because she don't act rational, she kinda simple and not really smart(okay, maybe it's my personal reasons), but do not forget about what i said before ""we do not really know these characters"". Well, if Kyle as simple as he looks, we can assume that we know him, but again, we have no idead about the certain events of his life, we didn't see him much among people to grasp his full personal portait. And even when we see the future, we are not that impressed by effects of that time to fully believe in dangers of war, moreover it looks both boring and unreal(in sense that you don't feel like it is happening for real), very much like action scenes. Lore is kinda simple and not intriguing. So we can come up with the conclusion that this movie has not many things to offer to the viewer. But now to the pros: shooting is quite good, Arnold acting Terminator is convincing(though it is not a simple role), overall acting is authentic, we do not just hear that Kyle is a soldier but we see every aspect of it( war flashbacks, raws, his slim body, his fighting skills, he is not afraid, he don't really pays attention to his wounds(and also not used to think abouth not critical pain), when soldier from future can knock out policeman without using hands), Terminator looks terrifying, decorations is good, movie itself aged not bad(unlike Star Wars 1 or 4 or any before the new ones). So, for the attention to details and caring i'll give it additional star, but i can't rate this film any high. If you not that of true cinematography lovers or art lovers, yeah, many people say the are, but, in fact, nearly no one is. If you think that Nolan Batman movies are good, you probably like it very much, but actually it just reflects your absence of atteintion and taste(no offense, but more or less my ratings and reviews(my approach to rate and review) aimed on minor audience that wanna see something really outstanding, or unconventional or spent their time not bad in the worst case). But here is the thing, Terminator 1984 as enetertainment or let's say ""good time spent"" and it is not art.",
626,13 November 2015,idanvinter123,9, Could've Been So Much Better,"By the look of the title you'd think I'm in some way disappointed about this movie. I'm actually not, but like the title says- the movie had some mistakes that could've been fixed if they would've maybe re- write the script or change something in the movie, nothing major or huge but still pretty important issues. Now let's move to the ''why this movie's awesome'' section: The action is truly great, the dialog is also great, Arnold is epic and brilliant, Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor was excellent and the story is original and great. Now the ''why this movie's not fantastic'' section: The way the story was told wasn't great, I felt like it could've been told better, Michael Beihn wasn't as good as I was hoping he would be, the romance part between Sarah and Kyle didn't work in my opinion... The thing that bothered me the most was that the first half of the film wasn't explained to the audience until THE VERY NEXT HALF. I was a bit confused over what was going on in the first half of the movie that I didn't get any explanation just the the second half, which is my biggest problem in this film. No matter how cool or great the first half is, if you don't explain the audience what's going on and why- they'll be confused for a long time and it's very bad if this happens. Overall, it still is a great film, definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of Sci-Fi/Action, or just a fan of Arnold.",

Aside from a few shoddily obvious rear projection shots, the special effects are still realistic and credible, and much of the f/x makeup and prosthetic work remain seamless.

But that led him to The Terminator, it started off as he was having a dream about being chased by a killer cyborg while he was on directing the Piranha sequel although he'd been bed ridden because he got sick from the food poisoning. Arnold Schwarzenegger was known as a body builder not really an actor. Originally Schwarzenegger wanted to play Kyle Reese the man sent from the future to protect Sarah Conner. But it ultimately went to Micheal Biehn. This is for the best as Schwarzenegger's terminated is known now to be one of the best movie's villain's of all times. James Cameron originally plan was to only have one movie, but the success critically and commercially led to four sequels (one of which he directs). The visual effect's for the movie are amazing as for the time of the initial release no one had ever seen anything like it making James Cameron a legitimate filmmaker in Hollywood. The acting is strong and is easy to follow, the ending of the movie is what you wouldn't expect leaving you with hope. If you thought this is another low-budget crappy sci-fi thriller you'd be wrong as this movie launched James Cameron's career, Arnold Schwarzenegger's career, Michael Biehn, and Linda Hamilton's and with Bill Paxton's cameo.

And the machine can't be dropped: the difference from humans is properly in its incapacity to understand emotion and to understand limits; if it's created for destroy, if it understands just the obligation to live better (and for this also killing creators, seen as weak and imperfect), nothing can't defeat it, and the last scene, with the Termination disposed to fight until it can reveals this strange creepy strength that comes not from willing but from a mechanical rationality and program.

To start of The Termintator works as a great science fiction/time travel story, but transends that and goes of into other fantastic realms as Cameron takes the film and turns it into a great gothic love story, a nightmarish thriller and a story of irony and love. It is a classic film and one that defines the 80's. Where he suceeds most is with his story. Cameron's abilities as a story teller is what makes him one of the best directors working today and the story of Sarah Connor and the battle to either save or end her life is compulsive film and is dealt with with great assurance from Cameron as he takes full control of the screenplay and the direction, squeezing every emotion and inch of suspense for all it is worth.",

Its packed with solid action, a good plot, and good direction. The only thing was the special FX, but considering the film's budget and that it was 1984, they are not bad. But comparing them to today's they are kind of weak.  But besides that, this is one hell of an action film.  Arnie's does'nt say much but he does a good as the title character.  I also thought Michael Beihn gave a good performance as the rebel soldier sent back to protect Linda Hamilton.  The action scene's were also solid, especially the car chases and the shootout at the police station.  In all a highly recommended film, especially for fans of Arnold as well as sci-fi action film's.  4/5",

The setting is dark, moody, depressing - all of the things you need to make an end of the world scenario believable. It is quite gory and violent without being too much. The story of the film is excellent, the acting very good, but the atmosphere is what really makes this film work in my opinion. Films today lack atmosphere, darkness and grit. This is a masterclass of how to create tension in the audience. It really is gripping, scary and has just the right balance of action and dialogue. Take note new film makers, less is definitely more. You cannot beat this movie. It never gets boring. Classic.",

The narrative however, is kept pretty linear, nothing else is happening but what you are seeing happening. Character development and narrative subtexts are also kept to a minimum so we are firmly concentrated on the action and the simple task that this unstoppable killing machine is trying to achieve. This is a formula Cameron would successfully repeat and more for his spectacular sequel T2, one of the best examples of a sequel surpassing its predecessor in terms of quality. However, he had a bigger cast, crew and lots more money for that and there is no doubt he would have made most of his later films like The Terminator if he wasn't given loads of dosh! (Damn Titanic studio execs!) However, The Terminator is a great, original film in its own right, perfectly suited to its 80's setting and besides it is also notable for making a star of Arnie. His monosyllabic T-800 became a cultural icon, getting more menacing as the film progresses into a thrilling climax.

I decided to go back and watch the first two movies and they were much much better. This movie is great and was a more engaging film with great characters, soundtrack, tone, writing, and the terminator being more interesting/badass. The action scenes are fun to watch, the drama is well done, it's funny with the terminators come backs etc. The relationship between Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor was believable. The films pacing was really well done also I never felt bored in the movie due to it's solid directing. It's acting is good tho certain characters could've done better.

This movie balances a very personal story with end of the world stakes, superbly well. Kyle Reese (Michael Bhien) is a very well written character, his motivations are set up nicely and his development throughout the movie is really Interesting. The Idea of Sarah Connor's (Linda Hamilton) character and what she means is so amazingly interestingand it really gets your brain going, which is a problem with movies today. The 80s time period in which this film was made, and obviously set, feels so fitting to the story. The monster that is the Terminator, played off course by Arnold Schwarzenegger, is simply terrifying. A big beefy man that is a machine designed to kill immediately creates this sense of nervousness. When you're watching this film you have this feeling to look over your shoulder, almost like It Follows (2014) does. Every action scene is gripping and feels haunting. The score by Brad Fiedel feels very dated at times and is kinda goofy but the main theme remains one of my favourites. This film to me did so many things for the first time in cinema history and doesn't get the credit somerhing like say Star Wars does. The Terminator is one of my all time favourites and really deserves appreciation.",

I started watching it thinking it was gonna be good - it was great. If there's anything I didn't like, it was that they made the future seem so dark. Overall it had a great sense of being in the action from beginning to end. I sure didn't expect the terminator to die in the way he did, neither did I expect Reese to get killed either. Another thing I liked was that Sarah Connor didn't even believe Reese about the Terminator until the police station scene (that was pretty funny how she saw the Terminator get up after being shot in the club, and still didn't believe it). I do have a question, though. When the Terminator went into the gun shop, they didn't do a background check for him or make him sign any forms (before he shot the clerk). Imagine if they did...""Sir, you're from the future, you're a man-killing robot, and we can't sell you these."" But my point is - this is a great movie for both action and sci-fi lovers alike. Thumbs up.",

As a kid games like missile command and movies like war games were a constant reminder of the possibility of a nuclear war. Never really considering what might start a nuclear war the intelligent machine sci-fi aspect of the movie is original. A Terminator hunting down mercilessly is a terrifying thought. Extremely well paste, the editing is amazing, the visuals are very well done especially for its time. Although it is extremely dated this movie is effective, terrifying and a masterpiece.

You can't think Terminator without thinking ""Ah'll be back.""

This story is very thrilling, but has some emotional parts. I like the way to show that the strange man is very strong. He is in good shape, and also does not smile at all. When I thought of the time that this man comes to the real word, I could help feeling fearful. However, this happening is never occurred in this world, so I could enjoy watching the film. On the other hand, the content is a little bit complicated for me, especially, the relationships among people. One more thing I was surprised to see is that there are some grotesque scenes in the film.

709,4 May 2006,clementtuffreau,10, a cold war masterpiece,"As used to say a friend of mine watching Terminator : cold war masterpiece. You couldn't say it a better way. James Cameron's best movie might be the most dry movie you'll ever see. It is not a movie, in fact, it is a tunnel. Once you enter it, you cannot go out until the end. The talent of great directors is to operate a kind of fusion between a great universal story (here : primal fear, pure fear, and violence) and powerful images. The talent of genius is to invent a character that will be used out of the context of the art form : it has been the case for Lewis Carrol's Alice, Jerry Siegel's Superman, it is the case for TERMINATOR. Cameron, alongside with Schwarzenneger, has invented a legend : the pure, the perfect killing machine. It never stops. The Terminator is the definition of cinema : once the film has started, it wont stop until THE END. Once the Terminator arrives, it won't stop either. After that very simple (but so powerful) basic rule, Cameron has just put everything he had in his hands to make it quick, straight and super clear. The editing is direct. Pictures are clear. Music is brilliant, reminding of Carpenter's Assault, meeting with an industrial rock band. Each element of the script is given in a short dialog between bullets storm. So why a cold war masterpiece ? Well, with this dark light, poor areas, lost streets, suburbs houses looking all alike, with Schwarzenneger and his very far far away English accent, you've never seen a movie making the USA look that close to the Soviet Union.",

This movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the silent killing machine known to man as The Terminator (T-800 Model 101) and is sent into time to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton)to prevent the birth of her son, future leader resistence John Connor. A future soldier by the name of Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is sent to 1984, to intercept The Terminator  before it kills Sarah. The acting in this film is memorable, Arnold is perfect as The Terminator with absoutely no emotion of killing people. Biehn is great as Reese a soldier who is bound by duty and honor but never has experienced Love in his life which he will receive later on and is potrayl is so real you can not help but feel sorry for him. Hamilton does a wonderful potrayl as Sarah Connor the victim of all this who can't believe that she will be the mother for the future and is scared about what happens when she has this child. Other supporting Actors are good including Paul Winfield and the late Lance Henriksen a Cameron favorite. This is proberly James Cameron's greatest achievement in 1984 whenever he made this movie he wrote and directed, along with his former wife producer Gale Anne Hurd. The Visual Effects in today's standards are not up to par but however still they are bot bad for a movie made in 1984 and besides Orion Pictures Studio only gave him a 6.4 millon dollar budget to work nothing much i would say. However the makeup designs and creations by Stan Winston are still excellent to this day he remains one of the best Creature designs ever (Endoskeleton for example remains the best work in 1984). The Terminator serves as a great art for filmmaking it inspires filmmakers to make what you have. Regular scale: 4.5/5; 1-10 Scale: 9.5/10.

723,8 September 2011,compi24,8," Review Of ""The Terminator""","I honestly don't think that this movie needs an introduction, but I'll give it one anyway - ""The Terminator"" is a 1984 film crafted by legendary filmmaker James Cameron. The film follows tells the story of a cyborg assassin (Schwarzenegger) who is sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 to kill a young woman (Hamilton). Well, starting from the top, the movie's premise is certainly bizarre and outlandish, though Cameron and team seem to successfully transcend this obstacle by presenting the film's plot with utmost realism and seriousness. Quite possibly the greatest aspect of the film is, in fact, Arnold Schwarzenegger's truly menacing portrayal of the titular character. I wouldn't go so far as to say that this was a difficult performance, but Arnold pulls off one of his earliest acting roles with an intense amount of menace. The action sequences were also a masterstroke aspect of the film. Nearly every set piece in the film contained a good dose of thrills and jaw-dropping moments. The movie itself is, arguably, one of the greatest and most revolutionary science fiction films in film history. ""The Terminator"" was one of the first films to introduce the concept of self-aware artificial intelligence to the big screen, it catapulted the careers of Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron to new heights, and simultaneously introduced several memorable lines of dialogue that most people are familiar with. In 2008 ""The Terminator"" was selected by the Library Of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, being deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". Did it deserve this honor? I believe so. For, ""The Terminator"" was a fun, intelligent, novel film for me to experience.",

The massive body and the perfectly chiseled face. Who else looks as superhuman as he does? It starts to stroll the streets.

Arnold Scwarzenneger is scary as the terminator trying to kill Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton)because her unborn son has great significance in the future to come!And Kyle (Michael Biehn)is the man set out to protect her. The chemistry between Sarah and Kyle is very strong. But its really upsetting when he dies as he was meant to be the father of Sarahs unborn child John!This is classic entertainment that has a very strong story to it and will be a film thats never forgotten no matter how old it is!,

Arnold's ability to project menace and an aura of invincibility are crucial to the success of the film and he doesn't disappoint.  From the moment the Terminator shows up he seems so ruthless and imposing that he literally seems unstoppable. I thought the scene in the disco was a real standout.  This movie was made before Cameron became a star director who could command big budgets and elaborate special effects.  The story and plotting are much tighter and more focused than in any of his other films and the result is a great action movie and Cameron's best work.  Highly recommended.,

James Cameron made this before he got the big bucks from Aliens and went on to make Terminator 2: Judgment Day. But to this day I consider this his best movie, because of the independent qualities that it has. Arnold's character has become classic now, and Cameron builds tension and real, actual horror from this creation instead of relying solely on special effects. This movie is called a thriller but should also be called a horror, because the way the Terminator chases Linda Hamilton and Nick Stahl is something to be truly feared, even if he is a robot. This movie is a futuristic allegory, full of meaning, full of thrills. One of cinema's most famous lines is ""I'll be back."" and it is from this movie. But this movie has never left.

When I first saw it, I didn't have much of a clue as to what it was about. So when this android arrives from the future, inexplicably looking for ""Sarah Connor"", it was very mysterious and increasingly terrifying. As the movie progresses, it becomes increasingly clear this thing has no conscience, and is nearly unstoppable. Arnold Schwarzenegger gives it a suitably deadpan performance which only adds to the sense of dread. Linda Hamilton as a woman named Sarah Connor initially has no idea why she - a waitress in a coffee shop - would be a target of a thing like this. Only one man, Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese, seems to have some idea, but everyone else just thinks he's crazy. Who would believe a ridiculous story like this?

The Terminator took the Thriller genre to an even bigger height, the Terminator to Science Fiction to a bigger height, The Terminator took cinema to a bigger height. These kind of movies started out with Alien (when I mean these kind of movies, I mean Science Fiction Thrillers, with a whole bunch of guns, not like Invasion of The Body Snatchers) went to The Thing, and then came The Terminator. The Terminator changed cinema by the stunning special effects, the tremendous plot, and story that can't get better, the creative villian that won't stop till he kills. Also in most Science Fiction films you don't have much romance, in this one you do. This also continued with a woman being the heroe in a Science Fiction film, before Alien (the movie that kind of started for woman being heroes in Science Fiction films)there wasn't a lot. The Terminator also like Alien, kept you guessing till the end, thinking is he going to get killed now, or who will get killed. Other compliments for the film are the acting, which is tremendous, Arnold Schwarzenegger makes you really fell that the villian is really bad, he makes a good job of playing a computer. Linda Hamilton is excellent because she does a great job of being scared. The writing is great, this film created a line that everybody knowes: ""I'll be back,"" one of the most famous lines, right up there with ""Bond, James Bond.""

One is where Arnie's T-800 goes on a LA wide killing spree, which is the best part. The second section on the other hand is packed with Jim Cameronesque preachy symbolism and dull to lifeless performances by supporting characters. The epicentre of this A bomb of underacting is Michael Biehn's dreadful performance as Kyle Reese.

This movie has a big series of special and practical effects which are very peculiar for an 80s movie and the story is very interesting and engaging.,
781,22 January 2006,ingrid-vuga,9, terminator...legend,I saw this movie when i was 5 and since saw it at least 100 times...not joking. It is one of my top 5 movies. I've got to say this that the producers thought that this movie isn't going to be a big hit. This blockbusters made Arni a big star. Linda Hamilton plays the mother of John Connor-future hero off the earth.Arni has been sent to earth to kill her. The resistance is aware of this fact and sent back to the year 1984 a man to protect Sarah Connor(Linda H.)-Michael Biehn. He is a normal human while Arni is a machine and much more powerful. By the way: they sent these machines back to the future in the year 2029. So M.Biehn falls in love with Sarah and so becomes the father of John. In a final battle Arni and Michael both die. The remains of the Terminator are shown in T-2 ....well this movie is just a great one!!...you must see it. And includes one of 6 great scenes in movies of all times....I am talking about the part when Arnie says: I'll be back.. I give it 9/10 because it just is not that perfect...i think if the budget was a few millions bigger it would have been perfect,
782,5 September 2010,Velociraptor256,8," Dark, fascinating and pretty much brilliant","James Cameron's first full stint as a director, and Arnold Schwarzenegger's first time in his most famous role, is still definitely a worthwhile watch, though not without its flaws. Thanks to its cinematography and particularly good soundtrack, this movie has a great atmosphere, dark and frightening and not for the faint-hearted. The action scenes are good for the 1980s at least, but some of the special effects for the Terminator look a bit dated these days: for example, in one scene, the use of an obvious animatronic head that doesn't even really look like Arnold.",
783,22 May 2002,c1k3,8, Impressive,"While this film may not be as good as its successor, it is unquestionably more impressive. Terminator 2 had a $100 million budget, the largest of any movie that had yet been made. The Terminator was filmed, produced, and distributed on a meager budget of $6 million. If you were to watch the movie, you would never know it. The things that James Cameron was able to do with such a limited budget is nothing short of remarkable. Downsides: The 1980's style of this movie makes everyone look absolutely terrible.  The soundtrack is also one of the worst ever produced. 3.5 out of 5",
784,3 October 2003,druryd,9, One Of The Best Sci-Fi Films Ever.,"The Terminator is one of the best Science Fiction films ever made. Although the plot is somewhat simplistic, the non-stop action and excellent performances more than make up for the thin plot.  One of Arnold's best performances (due to the lack of dialogue). Highly recommended for Sci-Fi fans. My rating 8.8 on a scale of 10.",
785,20 December 2004,Tom16uk,9, 100% classic stuff.,"The Terminator has everything - action, romance, slight humour and a brilliant storyline. The reason the story line is so good, is because unlike a lot of films these days, this film could become a reality. The idea of machines and computers taking over our world is a definite possibility, as they will indeed become cleverer than us. (fact)",
786,19 May 2009,SmakethDown638,10, The amazing beginning!,"This was the film that made me a Terminator fan for life! Sure, I saw T2 in theaters as a kid before I ever saw the original, but this movie did the trick. The Terminator has a terrific blend of action and horror as it makes for a great little roller coaster. This has an original plot, great acting, and a great theme. The fear of machines taking over the world through a nuclear war vs humans is depicted beautifully in the future/flashback (or flash forward ha ha)scenes! Great casting as James Cameron created the start of my all-time favorite franchise. ",
787,8 July 2006,moocus,10, One of my favorite Sci-Fi Films,"THE TERMINATOR is about an almost invincible cyborg sent back to 1984 in order to terminate Sarah Connor, who will give birth to John Connor, leader of the human resistance in the year 2029. A man named Kyle Reese is sent back to protect Sarah from the powerful cyborg. When I first saw this, I thought to myself what a masterpiece. This is without any doubts, Arnold's best performance and most memorable one. Biehn and Hamilton also give impressive performances. I also liked the score. Very machine-like and flows perfectly with the terminator story. I have this film on DVD and I have seen it about 70 million times. I never get bored of THE TERMINATOR. I can watch it over and over again. I think the story is very solid and highly original. James Cameron, thank you for making one of the best films ever.",

789,3 November 2001,smallchief,10, Best villain ever,"Terminator is a good movie primarily because Arnold Schwartznegger (sp?)is the most evil, relentless villain in the history of film.  He is a killing machine disguised as a human being and his lack of any feeling, any remorse, any spark of humanity is chilling indeed. It has a pretty clever story line too.  As action movies go, Terminator is near the top of the list.",
790,3 June 2009,ryanaustinf,7, Amazing!,"Ahh... James Cameron. One of the best directors ever. From this to Titanic, some of the best movies ever. But today I'll be reviewing one of his movies. The Terminator. This movie is one of the best. It is action paced and it actually works as a love story.SO! on to the main review. The main characters of this movie are Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) and Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn). They are pretty good characters and the actors just make it better. Kyle is kickass and Sarah is also awesome especially near the end. The main villain, of course all of you should know this by now, is The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). He is AWESOME! He doesn't have a personality but you can sort of get one OUT OF A FRICKIN ROBOT! He's just awesome that way. The supporting characters are basically the police lieutenant (Paul Winfield) and while he's on screen, he does a pretty good job! The action is just amazing. It kept you watching and the suspense could cut you like a knife. And finally, the story is actually kinda complicated but still good. A war in the future forces the robots to send a terminator to destroy the mother of their best fighter, John Connor. John then sends Kyle to protect his mother. Then the rest is running for a Arnoldinator. But it's more complicated than that which this is my only gripe. The story has what is popularly known as the Connor Paradox. If Kyle Reese is the father of John Connor since he made love to Sarah, then how was John able to send Kyle if he hadn't even existed? Was his father a different person before he sent Kyle and he thought Kyle was cooler so he sent him to be his father? MY HEAD! the story is my only gripe. But overall, I give The Terminator, 80% awesome.",

792,22 November 2003,jarkantt,9, A legend of it's time.,"No doubt of it. The Terminator is a movie that I won't never forget. Mostly because of that Michael Biehn is on it but also because of it's made by master director James Cameron. Movie was the opening for many star actors of today; Arnold Schwarzenegger (as the Terminator), Michael Biehn (As the savior Kyle Reese), Linda Hamilton (as Sarah Connor). Even Bill Paxton is on this movie. Movie is made with the touch of specialists (James Cameron, Gale Anne Hurd, Stan Winston, Brad Fiedel and so on),the effects are good for a movie of the 80's, music is...well what can you say except legendaric. The movie is getting little bit old, but it won't never be forgotten. Seriously I can say that is movie beats at least Terminator 3 and maybe even Terminator 2. A movie that no scifi fan should miss.",

794,28 February 2007,nrobinson10,10, One of the best movies... OF ALL TIME.,"This is, truly, one of the best movies of all time. Released in 1984, The Terminator has become an instant classic with critics, comedians, and die hard Schwarzenegger fans (such as myself). The opening scene, which is now considered legendary, starts out at 1:52am on a May morning, with an old man operating a fork lift, cursing when it won't work. Then comes the Terminator, Schwarzenegger's ultimate role, and the movie takes off. Featuring Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese, Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, and the masterful movie-maker James Camereon as director, this movie is no filler any way you look at it. Also it has some of the best movie scenes and quotes you'll ever see, like ""I'll be back,"" which has been slaughtered by comedians 'round the world. This film as an absolute MUST-HAVE, whether you're a Arnold fan or not. This movie will most likely be remembered 100 years after its release from 1984; it's already gone platinum twice after 23 years, and will most likely be released a third time as its 25-year anniversary. Truly legendary.",

This film a resistance soldier Kyle Reese played by a favorite actor of mine Michael Biehn is sent back to the year 1984 to protect Sarah Connor who is the mother of the futures only hope John Connor. The film is action packed as a man fights machine. What I love about this film is it has so many messages engraved within the storyline... just imagine some guy youve never seen before in your life arriving before your eyes telling you that the end of the world is near and that Machines are going to take over and that he's from the future.",
798,31 October 1999,Morpheus-76,10, The most relentless film ever made!,"This marked as Arnold´s and Cameron´s rise to stardom and was also a landmark in action and sci-fi films. Although the Terminator had a small budget, it´s still visually perfect and captivating. As for the acting, Arnold does what he does best and he does it well (he´s very convincing as a cyborg) although many would claim it´s not acting...  But the best thing about this film is it´s relentlessness; it´s totally merciless and humourless as it drives towards one of the best end-fights ever made. Music serves an important part in convincing the viewer of the sheer unstoppable evil of the Terminator who never rests. A total masterpiece which endures repeat viewings from year to year!",

810,8 October 2012,Shantell_sabbar,7, James Cameron. An Auteur?,"When watching a James Cameron film if you didn't know he directed it, you wouldn't guess. He doesn't exactly have the complete directive control on all of his films. He doesn't stick to the same genre; although no matter what genre his film is there is always a strong aspect of love and it isn't always romance. There is however some similarities within the films he has directed. Firstly, he has a large budget when it comes to making the film. Identifying the budget; Aliens was around $18,500,000; Titanic at $200,000,000, and a more recent film being Avatar at $237,000,000. Two top box office films were also both made by James Cameron so he is making a huge profit on what he is putting into the film. It could be argued that James Cameron is an auteur when it comes to money in terms of the budget and the profits. Secondly, there is always an aspect of strong love within his films. In both The Terminator, and Aliens the human forms a relationship with the non-human species although that same species within each film is shown to be bad. In Terminator the viewer witnesses a strong love between the robot and the boy almost like a father and son relationship although the enemy is also a robot. In Aliens, although it is a horror and the aliens are the enemy there is a scene where Ripley has no choice but to kill the alien to survive but it is quite emotional as there is a bond between this alien and herself. In both of the above films the non-human species is shown to be good and bad. It changes with Avatar. A human and a Na'vi fall in love, and instead of one of the non-human species being the enemy, the human is. Which takes the film from another perspective but it still shows a strong love within this film. Although not as obvious as another director such as Tim Burton for example, James Cameron could still be perceived as an Auteur in the ways mentioned above.",

It focuses on Sarah Connor, a woman who will give birth to the future resistance leader of the human race, as she is hunted by a robotic cyborg who has been sent from the future to kill her. She is also protected by a human called Reese who has also been sent from the future. The story is so unique and all the actors are amazing. The fight and action sequences are perfectly shot. Despite some people saying the CGI would be laughable but for the time it was released it was groundbreaking. The standout is Arnold Schawzneger who shines as the tough, emotionless cyborg.

It's the story, which along with ""Back To The Future"" explores aspects of time travel in an interesting way. It's also the way the Terminator is presented as a malevolence that is almost unstoppable. One of my favorite moments is watching Linda Hamilton's expression after Kyle Reese has pumped round after round in the the Terminator - and he still gets up! I swear, it is almost like ""The Omen"" - how do you stop a foe that is unstoppable? The 2nd movie was also good although I'm not wild about loudmouth kids acting beyond their years.

Like Special effects wizaed Stan Winston who has workin on all T movies said: "" Terminator was landmark in movie history"". Totally awesome movie. I wont starting telling you a plot because everyone knows it. At that time it was just called B movie. Studios didnt think that Terminator would be such a commercial and critical hit. It launched James Camerons and Arnold Schwarzeneggers to sky. Cameron become Hollywoods respect director and Arnie became actionstar. Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton did amazing perfomances. The movies budget was only 8 million dollars but still movie rocks!! Of cource special effects are bit old but it doesnt take the pleasure of seeing this movie. Cameron is such srong and good director that this could be made on limited budget. Buy special edition Dvd and I promise you will enjoy the extramaterial. James Cameron also wrote Arnies legendary line ""I´ll be back"". That became Arnolds trademark in his films. Checkout Bill Paxton in the beginning of the film as one of the punks.

A new book called ""Radical Evolution"" by Joel Garreau explores various endeavors by DARPA (Goverment's (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) The direction that scientists in the book are taking is one geared towards making people more than human (Enhanced) and melding them with machine and vice versa.

826,16 December 1999,Dave Evans,10, The defining film of our generation,"Well, my generation at least. Terminator is referenced in so many films it becomes impossible to list, it can be held responsible for a deluge of 'robot from the future' films, and yet its memory remains untarnished. Why? Because this is where it all began (yes I know there were similar films before Terminator, but how many can *you* name? And how many were this influential?) As well as launching the careers of most of the actors, it catapulted James Cameron into the limelight. The plot, which seems so simple (robot from the future comes to kill someone) is incredibly complex, depending on how far you wish to analyze it. There is so much material in the Terminator world that even the sequel barely scratched the surface, and although it is only hinted at in this, the background history (future?) gives the story unparalleled depth. I can't think of another film that has ever had me thinking about the possibilities for so long (and then you start thinking about temporal paradoxes and go insane...) or that has captivated me so completely. The Terminator is the only film that I could even think of describing as flawless, and it still remains my fervent wish to see it on the big screen (sadly I was 4 when it was released) So in case I'm being too subtle for you, I absolutely love this film.",

836,13 April 2020,Emre-kyncu68,7, THE TERMINATOR,"The Terminator, the first film of the terminator series, which is a 36-year-old series, still manages to be a traceable quality film even though it was produced in 1984. At that time, he was one of the best science fiction movies with Star Wars and Alien. In 2029, terminators take over the world. Terminators are intelligent robots made of almost immortal strong metal, bullet proof and human skin. John Connor, on the other hand, is able to kill these terminators thanks to the technology he finds and he fights against the terminators with the people who are left behind. He returns to the past with a time machine on the terminator and tries to kill Sarah Connor, his mother, so that John Connor was never born. The scenario is briefly like this. First of all, although the movie is a 36-year-old movie, it does not reveal it at all. The terminator character is both realistic and puts the name's weight. Arnold Schwarzenegger is cut out for the terminator role. Overall, the player selections are successful. The script is also beautifully detailed and beautifully rendered. The voiceover fits well into the characters. Music is suitable for the theme of the movie. The only thing that gets stuck in my head comes from the future of Kyle and is John Connor's father in the future. How did John Connor know that Kyle was his father, or if he made a mistake and sent someone else out of Kyle into the past, he would never have been born. Maybe they will elaborate a bit more in the next movie of the series, I hope this subject. Watch it right away if you haven't. My score for the film is 100/77",

All these movies like: Star Trek, Star Wars, Battle Star Galactica, etc. started really to bore the people. Of course Star Trek and Star Wars were pretty cool, but after those movies, the rip-off sci-fi started. Until 1984. This year was an important year for the science-fiction, because this is the story: in 2029 the world is in hands of the machines, which are raised out of the nuclear mess after the Nuclear War. But the machines are almost defeated by mankind, thanks to their leader John Connor. But the machines sent a advanced cyborg back to 1984 to kill the mother of this leader: Sarah Connor.

839,19 June 2004,nicklavigne,9, A True Sci-Fi Classic! 8.5/10,"When The Terminator came out in 1984, it launched Arnold Schwarzenegger into super-stardom and established its director James Cameron as one of Hollywood's most talented directors by becoming one of the most successful movies of the year. The story of a cyborg brought back through time from 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, a woman who's unborn son will become a military leader and help mankind fight the machines who will take over the world in a near-future captivated movie-goers everywhere around the world. The movie was shot with a $6 million budget and ended up grossing more than $80 million worldwide and became a sci-fi classic among fans. Although the movie was overshadowed by its 1991 super-sequel, T2, The Terminator stands on its own and manages to give good thrills and great action sequences even with its small budget. Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect in is landmark role as a fearless mean-killing machine who has no remorse and no pity for poor Sarah Connor who's life changes after Kyle Reese, a soldier who was also sent back from the future to protect Sarah against the terminator. Linda Hamilton is excellent and so is Michael Biehn as Sarah's love interest and father of her son, Kyle Reese. Most people have seen T2 and have missed this incredible first chapter to one of the best science-fiction sagas in movie history.

When I first saw it and checked the year of the film and saw it to be 1984 I was gobsmacked and I thought to myself. ""Woah this film is seriously ahead of its time."" And it truly was. The plot itself has everything action, love, suspense, emotion and a great ending. The acting is first class aswell with superb displays from Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, Michael Bhien as Kyle Reese and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator which began an oddessy of action films for the Austrian star. As for the storyline its out of this world and is surely Cameron's brainchild. As for the premise Kyle Reese and the Terminator have been sent from the future with two different objectives, the terminator's is to kill Sarah Connor so that her unborn, unconcieved son John Connor never sees light of day. Reese's is to protect Sarah from the Terminator. Who is John Connor? John Connor is the leader of a human resistance that fights against an uprising by enhanced machines after a nuclear bomb launched onto LA.

Michael beihn who is also known for choosing not to play the main as he plays such a good part is awesome in this movie and i have looked for him in many other movies due to his performance in this, which is also brilliant in aliens, another favourite movie of mine....terminator two was also very good because it has the right kind of humour in it, whereas when i watch the third instalment i think of it as ""seperate"" from the other two as you cant take it seriously and i think that really spoils what could have been a slightly better movie, shame Cameron's didn't direct! a great movie that is definitely worth owning,",

The characters are Sarah Connors, Kyle and the T-800, that the first two characters are the protagonist and the T-800 is the movie antagonist.

Because that's what he seems to be; a monstorous, mechanincal tyrant, a cold blooded killer. Michael Biehn defined the phrase ""action star."" He play Sgt. Kyle Reese like a flute, note for note. He plays his character with emotion, energy and depth, much better than most Hollywood ""action stars."" Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor was just fine, I didn't find anything about her performance dazzling, but it was good. This movie is called The Terminator, but the stars of it are Reese and Connor. Without Reese, there was no story to the events taking place, without him, we'd have no idea about what was going on. And, like most movies, this one is about a girl, Sarah Connor, once the girl next door, a simple college student and part time waitress, who becomes wrapped up in the future in the making. Story summary: In the year 2029, machines, that humans built to serve them, have taken over, and now the humans either serve them, or fight against them. The leader of a Resistance force, John Connor, learns of the machines devious plot to kill him. The machines; Skynet, will send back their ultimate weapon; a highly advanced, cold-blooded killing machine, a Terminator. Skynet will send back a Terminator (Schwazenegger) to the year 1984, nine months before John Connor would be born, by killing his mother. John sends back the first volunteer to 1984 to protect her, Sgt. Kyle Reese. With Reese to protect her, teach her, and guide her, Sarah Connor must survive this ordeal, or the human race is doomed. The odds are not good, Reese with no modern weapons or help must protect Sarah, or die trying.",
891,26 November 2020,gurhn,8, A True Science Fiction,"Although shot in the 1980s, this movie, which has inspired many contemporary movies, is a masterpiece. The details in the Terminator's view (textual and numerical information) are similar to the features we can currently see in technological glasses.",
892,1 August 2005,Moviemanic89,10, Best Movie of the late 80's!!,"I think that everyone must see this movie because in this day and age, movies are not made like this. Today there is too much special effects it's ridiculous. True this movie uses stop-motion animation but it doesn't even come close to LOTR or Jurassic Park. Yes this movies was made by Cameron but if you can look past that, then you will enjoy this movie. Now this movie is not as good as two but still is a classic hands down. This movie is even on 3 different AFI'S 100 Greatest lists. Now there is something to think about.",
893,18 December 2005,rbtlf,8, Scared crooked,"Then along came a terminator............when I first saw this film in 1985..............it scared me...............the end was a real nail biter. It was, at first - I feel; a kinda low budget- side alley/ side track film -that got a kinda cult'a feeling about it.",
894,7 January 2022,woolfalljones,1, He'll not be back... on my screen,This film is really bad and badly aged. Not for people who like visual effects or strong plot.,
895,19 August 2019,otsima,1, Nice,This movie is so so interesting,
896,27 May 2006,hayley-jackson,9, a great film!!!,"this is a fantastic film especially if you enjoy horrors and sci fi films.its about a cyborg sent from the future to kill the mother of the leader of the human resistance.in the future, machines rule the world and one man called John Connor created the human resistance to fight back against the machines. Arnold Schwarzenegger is brilliant as the terrifying cyborg even though he doesn't have to say much in the film.He has come to teminatinate John Connor before he has even been born The main character is Michael Biehn who plays kyle Reece, he narrates the story to the audience and Linda Hamilton is good at the woman who's world has been turned upside down. the special affects are not that good now but at the time they were really good especially for the end scene between the terminator and Sarah Connor. if people liked this film they should definitely watch its sequel as it gets even better than the first!!",
897,26 December 2019,ratinmash,7, It's well good entertainment,"I ain't even attempted to write a review since 1990, that's just cos of certain legal stuff which I don't want to legally talk about. Anyways, this movie properly blew my brains out and splattered them on the wall, back in the day, And it still deserves nuff respek, surely? You've got your fancy CGI stuff and that, and of course in that (cutting his eye out scene, his head looks well plastic) but realism is only as real as the perception of the perceiver, surely.
Anyways, its a love story, that is told under very caotic situations. But that love made J. Connor.",

900,24 March 2020,kurbanowmerdan-94936,10, Terminator the best,"If I had a ability to erase memory, I will do, and watch terminator for the first time. I don't know why some people put love scores because of graphics? I think in the film the main reason should be a good scenario.",
901,19 June 2020,stonesandsticksbreakbones,10, A stellar thriller,"I love this movie for its horror, thriller, low budget, and sci-fi elements that make this film one of the greats. It has an amazing soundtrack too.",
902,18 September 2006,qhr-1,10, Terminator = Cinematic Perfection,"James Cameron's 1984 low-budget blockbuster film The Terminator, one of the most popular movies of the 1980's, has become an American cinematic legend whose follow-up installments T2 and T3 continued to push the boundaries of action, suspense, and special effects. The success of the first film is due to many factors, primarily Cameron's cinematically efficient illustration of a tight story that he fills with powerful and iconic imagery frequently interspersed with dark humor.",
903,22 September 2020,stentechnology,9," This is just for school, please ignore this","Opinion:
At first I didn't quite get what the movie was about but when you get farther into it you'll know what it's about, I just really enjoyed watching it because it's a die hard type ish movie and there is a lot of chaos but not too hard to follow, the jokes of Arnold were really funny over all",
904,1 November 2001,acaramello72,10, I think IMDB is awesome!,"I think that this was the greatest movie ever made, it had plots that weren't old and stupid, michael biehn has been my favorite actress since I was little and this is actually the first movie I have ever seen, it came out a year before I was born and my dad would always rent it and I still remember it!! I love it!!! Does anyone know if they are coming out with a third one???",
905,15 February 2007,bilisnet,10, My opinion,"The killer machine from future is here. Tonight they will settle the future of the world. Arnold Schwarzenegger does the best role play what i know.Play the role of terminator. So brutal so cool. I just love this. James Cameron so think-full director. And the music of film is also nice. Even thought it is so 80's it rules. I think first Terminator is much darker than second one. But plot is very tight and not so humorous than second one. There is many memorable moments in this movie. When terminator goes in police station and first time says: I'll be back, and shooting on disco when Sarah is Resguet by Jonh's dad. Many old movies look ridiculous nowadays, but not this one.",
906,10 April 2022,paraskevis-35666,8, Still my favorite one,"After watching through the whole franchise, this one is still my favorite. I just feel that all the sequels went waaay too far in the action direction.",
907,25 January 2002,imida234,9, Wow!!!!!,This film has to be the most terrifying film ever and it does not let up for the entire film. This film was also special for the leading man Arnold schwarzenegger (who absolutly laps up the role of the machine that wont die) as this was the film that made him a hollywood star.n Anyway back to the film as you my know arnold is the cyberdyne model 101 terminator who is sent back throught time to kill the mother of a future rebal leader John Conner because he is the one who can wipe out the machines existence. Also sent back through time is a lone warrior called Kyle Reese (played by Micheal Biehn) who has been sent to protect Sarah conner (played by Linda Hamilton). The plot moves at such a fast pace that the action move to fast to keep up with. Overall this has to to be my altime favourite film. 9/10,
908,17 June 2007,nyyllfe,9, Where it ALL STARTED!!,"Watching this movie, leaves you scared and stuck to the screen! Great makeup and effects for its time, especially being able to pull off after being low budget. A must see movie for all guys (girls can watch to). You also get a nice little love scene ; ) Great action, great suspense. Although not required to understand the other two terminator movies, this one shows the 'bad' side to the terminator. Great lines were born from this movie, such as ""I'll Be Back"", ""Come with me if you want to live"", and ""knee caps!"" Great performances by Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The finale is filled with amazing thrilling action, and will let you leave the movie satisfied wanting to be part of the future!",
909,9 April 2023,eyedoctor-97908,7, Good Cameron film,This and 'Aliens' - forget 'Titanic.,
910,29 February 2008,ujcsillag,10, In retrospect maybe terminator is what George Orwell had in mind about doublespeak,"In 1984 I was 14 and reading George Orwell's novel titled 1984, written in the 1930's I think. I remember finding the book very thought-provoking and wondering about the agenda of world governments and covert agencies. The sign I was looking to confirm Orwell's predictions specifically was what was referred to as doublespeak especially by members of the government. That summer in 84 the U.S was in a military conflict with someone, I forget who now. When they attacked their enemies they ended up killing members of their own forces. It was the first public use of the words ""friendly fire"". After that I became somewhat obsessed with comparing what people said with what they obviously meant.",
911,22 January 2003,siisin,9, The Best Debut of any actor,"This film is magnificant, i mean u have this huge man/machine (Arnie) who just makes the film hit u even more...Imagine someone like emmm michael biehn as the terminator it just wouldn`t be the same, don`t get me wrong i think mike played an excellent part, but it wouldn`t so most of the credit should go to him, oh and cameron (great director i like all his films....titanic not in my fav films though) the story is superb and when u see the sequel it just goes together perfectly which is why i believe is what makes terminator 2 such a tremendous film! a true classic!!!",
912,2 April 2006,aalataur,10," Great, simply great","Well, what can I say. Simply the greatest action movie ever, and I've seen a LOT of them. ",
913,28 March 2004,ais_m,10, Amazing,"My favourite film of all time. It has everything - action, sci-fi and romance, what more would you want? The actors are amazing: Arnie - Shocking with his one liners; Michael Biehn - Breath-taking - everyones hero!; Linda Hamilton - ""The mother of the future!""; Great Writer/Director and an even better producer!; The colaboration between Gale Ann Hurd and James Cameron is breath-taking and one of there many films that they did together, It is also there best!",
914,29 April 2005,tomislav-bastac,10, The BEST,"I have to confirm that TERMINATOR is my favorite movie. It is just perfect.I have seen it first when I had 3 years and i still remember that moment. Story is unique and beautiful and it really can't be compared with movies like MATRIX because it is much better. Atmosphere is dark and scary. There are not many action scenes,like todays blockbusters, but there are wonderfully made. SCHWARZNEGGER is brilliant in his role,and he makes TERMINATOR character one of the most scaring characters in movie history. JAMES CAMEROON did excellent job, and he really deserves a title of the best today's directors.",
915,12 November 2004,martinoneill1888,10, Why this is the most important film of all time,"Being rather young when The Terminator was created (1984), I have grown up in the shadow of Arnie. Pretending to be the T1000 in the playground so that no_one could beat me. This film is most defiantly the best thing thats ever happened in our short colorful lives!",
916,18 December 2004,seanwestgate,10, Best Sci Fi movie for me,I loved this movie and found that it was totally believable. That was one of the things that I liked most. They covered all the believability issues and had plausible explanations for everything which left me feeling as if it could some day come to pass. Great film! Arnold cast as a cold killing machine that rarely if ever speaks was the best use of his natural performing talent as will ever be chosen. He was simply awesome and not cheesy at all. Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton were also really great. The ending of this movie was fantastic. The storm coming and the loneliness of it all for Sarah Connor. For an action film it did not have the cheesy ending one comes to expect. Rather it had that creepy feeling that humanity was set to begin a new dark age. Too bad other James Cameron films have not been as raw and fun to watch.,
917,6 April 2005,livingcorpse_scarface,10, Genius Movie!!!!!!!!(PLZ READ),"This is my favourite film, it really is great man. it is basically genius, anyone wanna say anything to me? i think that gladiator is also a good film, that is my second favourite film. The godfather films are also fantastic just as well as Leon and Scarface. 1. Terminator 1 & 2 2. Gladiator 3. Godfather 1 4. Scarface 5. Leon 6. The Green Mile I think that all of these films are fantastic and if there i anybody who thinks these are no good then you have to get your heads sorted. you should really watch these films they are all very good and well written, as a film critic it is vital that i share my information with the public, this is your chance to learn from a real movie genius.",
918,23 April 2015,shayanjameel,7," It was great. Is still is. Arnie was always the best as the bad guy. There's a rumor, Don't know if its true. Arnie has a brief cameo in Terminator Salvation.","Cameron was stuck in Rome in the early eighties editing Piranha II: The Spawning; a film that he was not even supposed to be working on. During the late nights in the editing room Cameron started to dream of an image of a robotic skeleton emerging from a massive explosion. He took that idea home with him and while waiting for his paycheck from Piranha II, he and his future wife future wife Gale Anne Hurd developed a story around the image.",
919,15 August 2018,JacKessler,10, Re-Watch(able),"Nothing to add to the positive reviews. However, during my early attempts to write screenplays, this was a film I played on repeat (often in the background) as one to study. I believe it is worth the same exploration for any brewing screenwriter.",
920,6 July 2018,bernalluis-99915,9, The perfect match-up ARNOLD and THE ANDROID,"A movie that personally inspired me to write SCI-FI, this movie became an instant classic, creating a new genre, and giving us the perfect role for a movie icon such as Arnold (even more fitting than Conan the Barbarian),",
921,27 July 2019,abhishekverma-16342,8, Best action scfi movie,"The greatest B movie ever made. James Cameron's first movie, and he delivers proves he's a genius from the start.

Yes the mono sound track and low budget effects are part of it's charm.",
