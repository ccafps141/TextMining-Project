0,24 January 2021,RJBrez,10," Best movie of the MCU, incredible from start to finish.","Infinity War is remembered mostly for how it ends, with good reason. But for me, the entire movie is incredible. Action, humor, cinematography, heartbreak, etc. It was a culmination of 10 years of character development. The benefit of that hard work? The movie can start with incredible action and never let up. Most wouldn't agree because of the ending, but I feel it's the best movie of the MCU (so far). Endgame was awesome, infinity war was better. I think the best part of it was the fact that we had so many cool character meet ups that as fans we never thought we'd see. Thor with the guardians? Wow. Star Lord and Iron Man? Rocket and the winter soldier? We could go on and on. They also mastered the art of humor to help offset some deep deep hurt throughout the story. Thor and Star Lords interactions are pure gold. Thor calling Rocket ""rabbit"" pure gold. Dr Strange and Tony going toe to toe is worth the price of admission as well. I'm going to stop now or I could type forever.",/
1,5 February 2021,Alex_Lo,10, Best Cliffhanger of all Time,"A meticulously planned film down to the last detail, where you can see how much love is behind it. Of course, the film delivers impressive show values and action, but besides, it is above all the interactions of the characters that are well thought out. Surprisingly, no character is neglected, and all the storylines of the previous films are brought together amazingly logical. The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars.",r
2,14 March 2021,grztxks,10, Better than Endgame,"Infinity war is one of the best MCU protects. It has a great story, great acting, and awesome looking. If you aren't a Marvel fan or haven't watched most of the previous MCU movies this however, won't be something for you. Let's start with Thanos, definitely one of the best villains, he has a motive, is well played, you can even say that Infinity war tells his story and not the story of a hero. But also most of the other cast members were great in their role and again, if you love Marvel, watch this movie.",e
3,16 February 2021,andreascaloni,9, EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER,"Avengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Joe and Anthony Russo create a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. Infinity war is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking.",v

6,5 February 2021,Abdulxoxo,8, A superior avengers sequel,"Although this film has 'Avengers' in the title, it ultimately belongs to Thanos. It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by.",w
7,21 April 2021,Puroo,10, How MCU should have always been like,"It was only after the release of Infinity War that I got interest in MCU. Before that I wasn't very much into superhero movies. So a couple of months after this movie released, I skimmed through all the MCU movies from Iron Man to Black Panther. I didn't put much focus into watching them all, since most of them were just following one pattern. Iron Man? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Captain America? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Thor? A guy ""loses"" and then gets superpowers, beats the bad guy and saves the day. Even in The Avengers and Age of Ultron it's just ""now all those guys come together, beat the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and save the day"". But Avengers: Infinity War is very much different.",/

9,2 September 2019,michaelhowell12,10, Way better than endgame,"This film is way better than endgame!
The actions better
The writings better
The dialogues better
The cgi is better
More shocks and more emotional.
Watching both in the cinema , the reactions to this in cinema was unbelievable compared to endgame. Dont get me wrong endgame is good but to say its the best marvel film is jus marvel fan boys being stupid.
I just dont see how people are saying endgame is the best marvel film when theres clearly other marvel films better than it!
But trust me this is the film that changed the mcu , lol maybe it because i wanted them to lose because thanos is badass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",w
10,29 November 2020,auuwws,10, avengers infinity war,"A wonderful movie and the action scenes in the film are some of the most wonderful, especially in the Battle of Titan. I liked the fact that Thanos was capable of defeating all the battles in the film and he did not use a plan and the end was sad, especially the death of Spider-man",4
11,25 October 2021,Filmdokter,8, It all led to this: superhero film at its best,"#MCUrewatch. A confrontation that has been in the making for dozen of films. Thanos finally arrives. And boy he doesn't disappoint. He is by far the most interesting MCU villain: strong, nuanced and perfectly performed by Brolin. This really is HIS movie. The film has a train like speed and one impressive sequence is followed by the next. Especially the banter between Thor and the Guardians and Iron Man vs Strange is what makes these Marvel films so fun to watch. Great climatic ending (a well ending...). As a stand-alone film it might not be as good as some others but as a showcase of what MCU has achieved, it has never been better.",1
12,25 April 2018,shawneofthedead,10," This movie will blow your mind and break your heart - and make you desperate to go back for more. Brave, brilliant and better than it has any right to be.","Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. ",4

17,8 January 2021,eva3si0n,8, The first Marvel film I really liked,"The first Marvel film I really liked. Surprisingly in the film there are many spectacular scenes, which are well held and the main transition between them is made seamless, which does not make you miss. And the main thing that surprises the film - the ending, it really makes it clear that Marvel now plays big, since began to break up with the main heroes of the giving films.",/
18,24 April 2018,garethvk,10, A Summer Film That IS Even Better Than The Hype,"Summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like ""epic"", ""spectacle"", and ""smash"" as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales.
The summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
When Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive.
With The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing.
Naturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence.
What really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other.
There are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film.
I was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene.
Believe the hype, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be.
5 stars out of 5",?
19,12 June 2018,jordanthomas_2009-346-914758,8, Breathtaking,"Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It's a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields. ",r
20,7 January 2021,miacoop,10, Amazing,With Thanos come into play you think that the avengers would be able to tackle this problem but no. After re-watching Infinity War multiple times it still gets me because it's sad the ending really is just another cinematic masterpiece which Marvel always pull off and the fight scenes are amazing. Marvel have some of the best actors and the best casts I'm not applaud them for that. No mad Steve was just sexy after mate and I loved it a lot.,e
21,17 December 2021,ACollegeStudent,9, The Bar for Super Hero Cinema,Rating: 9.0,f
22,4 May 2018,Horst_In_Translation,8, Taking the genre to the next level,"""Avengers: Infinity War"" is the newest addition to the now already long-running Marvel superhero franchise and in my opinion this movie is a definite contender for best installment of all. These 2.5 hours were directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, who started with Community and then entered the Marvel world with Captain America and for this new Avengers movie, they reunited with writers Markus and McFeely. Let me start by saying that I was a bit critical about previous Marvel films, especially Avengers movies as they frequently united way too many characters without properly elaborating on most of them. And the stories about them failing on their own against the villains, but eventually managing to succeed as a team after overcoming their conflicts and differences was gently-speaking not too new or creative. But this one here is different. Almost all characters have their moment to shine really, well Black Widow could have had a little more than that Hulk moment, but she is the exception. Even those they added new now like the Guardians of the Galaxy and the characters from Black Panther add their fair share of material worth seeing. Peter Dinklage is pretty interesting and memorable as a dwarf (yep!), the stories on romance and male friendship are nice to watch too and even Benedict Cumberbatch is tolerable for once.",_
23,6 September 2021,Dello_,10, The standard for every crossover movie,"Though this is not my favorite MCU movie I think ""Infinity War"" is the best product the studio produced both because of the really high scope and because of the execution itself. I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in ""Endgame"" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly ""Infinity War"" has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn't have asked for more.",=
24,25 April 2018,pranayjalvi,9, Infinity War deserved to be the best and grand,"The most anticipated movie of 2018 has now been released and my word, I have to say that Infinity War was brilliant on each scale, whether be its story, Visual Effects and the ensemble cast consisting all the Marvel characters. Every Marvel Fan needs to watch the movie as words cannot describe the magnificience of the movie.",t
25,12 May 2018,pjgs200,7, An objective review of Avengers: Infinity War,"I don't mean to be negative here, but Avengers: Infinity War's 8.9 on IMDb is entirely undeserved. Marvel superfan or not, this movie has nothing on films like The Dark Night, La La Land, Pulp Fiction, or Inception, all films which it either outranks based on it's 8.9 rating or comes close to. I get that there was an insane amount of hype around this film, and it's awesome to see our favorite Marvel characters come together (The Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Panther, etc.), but we shouldn't let our excitement over all of our favorite characters coming together cloud the fact that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an overly long movie that relies on cheap, unbelievable deaths to generate excitement and that isn't particularly well written or edited. I commend the directors and writers on being able to successfully interweave so many stories, but the movie just felt too long. ",t
26,9 May 2018,RNMorton,6, One hot mess,"Two other titles came to mind as I watched this. ""The sum is much less than the parts"", and/or ""Way too much on the plate"". As I've said in an earlier review on the Avengers, you get into this superhero escalation where the next movie has to be even more threatening and the evil even more evil than in the last one. Avengers 1 was the best superhero movie ever made period. Avengers 2 fell into the problem I just noted. Avengers 3 has just way too many important characters, story lines, plot twists, issues, blah blah blah. And the motivation and plan for the villain is about as sophomoric as you can get. One good thing - Doc Strange is actually using spells now, not just body throws. There's a number of good moments in this movie but it's just way too much and at its essence way too stupid.",_

30,19 June 2018,kevintgeisler,9, Excellent Film,"I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please. This movie was 2 1/2 hours long, but I could have sat there another 2 1/2 hours and not noticed. Thoroughly entertaining, and I love how the directors weren't afraid to take chances. I've read a lot of other user reviews that claim that there's no plot.

Every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for Infinity War because of their fundamental lack of understanding.

Most of the things I expect from the Avengers were absent in this film. There was very little working together to defeat a Foe; and way too much about the Bad Guy -- Thanos. Like, why do I care?

37,3 May 2018,georgewilliamnoble,3, 4DX Seat To Infinity!,"Sometimes in this life there are things beyond criticism, the Mona Liza for example or Turners rain steam and speed or Chaplin in The Kid. Masterpieces all, no debate right?
Then there are products is one soap powder really better than this other, or a $1000 perfume can it really be better say than one at a mere $10, beauty they say is in the eye of the beholder! So they say. Then there is this new mega movie Avengers Infinity War, now i would take issue with anyone that this is actually a movie at all, it is a consumer product the must see/ have accessory for the moment, Pre-sold, Pre-packaged to a ready made audience desperate to spend their money, it is just another fashionable element in today's throw away age. Telephones i believe are sold this way, at least this is how i see the commercial world of now. Now, i know my views are in total opposition to the frankly ridiculous high score's on this web site, and please don't think i am not grateful, my local multiplex needs big profit films to survive and hopefully prosper so the likes of me can see proper films that are real cinematic experiences but make next to no money, usually that's the fate of most superior films these day's! 
Can i be positive in any way about this Marvel, well i saw it in 4DX & 3D, the chair swam and jolted, there were lights, flashes, and sprays or did i imagine the last one, oh yes, the sound was loud, very very loud. and Oh yes do not forget, it is extremely long, very very long, like a bad flight across the Atlantic but without the benefits of a helpful service attendant's tray. Did i enjoy it? in any way, well no, just too much of a good thing, i like sugar in my tea, but 32 spoons is to much! This i will call it for ease, a film, it just had too much of everything. Now, i can just imagine steam boiling over from most readers that i am clearly to old and out of touch, but i argue not so, the trailer for Deadpool 2 was so funny and inventive that i am eagerly awaiting this release.

38,11 May 2018,Otte1,5, Enjoyment of movie depends of if you are a fanboy(girl) or not.,"The rating of 10 are obviously people under the age of 18 or extreme fans of Marvel. This is not even the best Marvel movie this year(Black Panther had better story & drama), definitely nowhere near 'best superhero movie ever'. The action and special effects are very well done, the pacing, powers and 'decisions' are on par with a B-horror movie. When having the ability to end a scene quickly or leave a scene quickly, our 'heroes' would stand there and trade one-liners. I seriously considered walking out at the lack of competence.

49,2 May 2018,gcarpiceci,2, Heavy Indigestion,"Sometimes when you cook a dish for your guests, you think that you'll make it more tasteful if you keep adding ingredients over ingredients; so, you have made this nice pizza, you have put your tomato sauce, your mozzarella cheese, maybe some ham, then you think why not some mushrooms, and well peppers will be just perfect on top it, and don't forget olives and cappers, hey we have some sausage in the fridge just slam it on top of it....etc. Most likely your guests will spend the night wrestling with your heavy-loaded pizza, trying to digest it.
Well, that is how I feel after watching Avengers - Infinity War; it's not by cramming piles of different super-heroes into one single movie that you make a great movie. It just results in a huge loss of focus and in the inability to pull together a cohesive story as you have to make space for this crowd of stars.
Note that I'm not even complaining about the ordeal of CGI: they have by now become a commodity in contemporary movies and not even only sci-fi, so their abuse in this case was in the expectations. But geeez, the plot....the plot is so thin that one might claim there is not one; just an infinite series of punches, hand-fights, bang-bang, etc...

57,14 May 2018,mitrapourmand,1, Worst MCU movie ever .,"We all know that these movies are blockbusters , we know that we should not expect much , when someone sits through one of these he /she should not expect citizen Kane , or the seventh seal , these movies are almost always mindless action scenes and big bangs and boom ( throw in a few punch line and some lame one liners and voila you have have your self an action movie ) but , at the same time these movies must be compared with other movies of the same genre , even the same universe to see pros and cons and for this i like to review it based on two of my favorite MCU movies. Winter soldier and Ragnarok , one being very serious the other choosing a very light and sarcastic approach ( almost parody like ) for their subjects , both i think did a far better job than this . As infinity war stumbles between being dark and fun and ends up tedious and stupid , characters do stuff which makes zero sense Heimadall can see all but he could not see Thanoses big ass ship ? Loki is holding the stone and he sends Hulk to earth ? Thanos acquires all the stones , becomes the most powerful being in the universe but has to kill people to save the universe ? cant he.. i don't know make the resources infinite and be everyone's hero ? If no , then why did it take him this long to act upon his plans ? Heroes run head on towards the bad guys LOTR style ? Its the 21 century guys humans don't fight that way you know , Thor has the power of lightening and thunder but needs an axe ? then why didn't he just chop off Thanoses head ? And the most important question , who invented these stones and don't they have something to say about how these things are used ? You see this is what makes a movie this big this bad . And since we are sure that the people who died are bound to be revived again ( don't bring visions back that guy is a nightmare ) there is no sense of tragedy or loss just a very lame move to pull on our heart strings .",

Other than Black Panther and warriors from Wakanda, but it shows more the often that The Avengers and the Marvel Universe lack diversity and is white privileged. It is yet again white people saving the Universe! Where did we hear that before! Also why does Marvel incorporated Thor, a greek god in their series and not for example the God Krishna from India? Towards the end there were so much of the same going on that you don't feel any empathy anymore of the entire Avengers crews when they died one by one, and you start to think the Universe might aswell be perished, who cares....cant stand the fact that this movies continue to go on and on, and wishing for it to end!

Will not a full-stop (Avengers 4 comes out next year), it does a great job of bringing the much-teased infinity stones/Thanos storyline together.

And I do admit it makes for a rollocking good time, a two-and-a-half-hour rollercoaster ride of thrills, spills and excellent special effects to tell a story of good and evil, chaos and destruction, with a massive and awesome span across the galaxy. Just seeing all of the returning characters is a delight in itself, and they're all given their own moments to shine. The humour is fast and witty as you'd expect from an Avengers film, and the startling CGI work is endlessly enjoyable. The story ably mixes together character interaction with big battles and showdowns and there's never a slow moment from beginning to end. I can't wait to see the follow-up!",
80,6 August 2018,phoenixinvictus,1, Worst Marvel Movie Ever With a Huge (or tiny) Plot Hole,"I can almost guess how the sequel is going to go... they are going to use some ridiculous time travel trick to undo all of Thanos damage. This two and a half hour movie was nothing more than a ten minute cameo for each actor to fight some alien.
The HUGE plot hole in this movie is Thanos ""plan"" and Ant-Man's mysterious absence in this movie. Let's see how absurd the plot hole of this movie is... Thanos' master plan is to wipe out half the population of the Universe because according to him there aren't enough resources for us all. Have you seen the size of the Universe??? The resources are almost endless! The Universe is a BIG place people! How can anyone not point that out to him? With his magic gauntlet complete he can just ""magic"" all the resources he wants with the snap of his fingers. Duh! But that is not all... Ant-Man possesses the technology to END WORLD HUNGER!!! All he needs to do is supersize ""a steak"" to the size of a ""truck"" and presto you can feed an entire city for weeks. Right there is the weapon to end Thanos' dumb logic.
Almost right in the beginning of the movie Thanos kills off the Asgardians on the ship, except for the main characters because... well just because we'll dump logic out of window and not bother the audience. Thanos then kills Loki-for REAL this time. Let me please have a moment to laugh out loud ha ha ha ha ha ha ha HA HA HA HA HA! Even if Loki is really dead this time I cannot feel anything but amusement at this ridiculous death for he has died so many times that I have lost count! Why should I feel sorry for a guy who wanted humans to worship him as a living god? Wasn't this the guy who literally placed his father in an old folks home to rot away? Wasn't he the one responsible for starting a war of genocide? Wasn't he the one who was responsible for the death of tens of thousands of people and caused the near destruction of New York City? Wasn't he the one who caused the invasion of New York City by aliens?
Let's face facts! Nearly every Marvel character has died and been brought back to life that it actually is getting boring!
Heimdall who is wounded uses the last of his powers to transport Hulk\Bruce Banner to Earth in an effort to warn the Avengers instead of-I don't know- beaming the tesseract away from Thanos. How about sending it to the edge of the Universe? It's not like he has a locating beacon to find these things.
Gamora wants to stay away from Thanos because she knows something that he wants and makes Star Lord promise her he will kill her (yeah right). Gamora then does the very thing she said she wouldn't do and runs directly to Thanos to engages him in battle where we all know that she will lose.
Aliens attack New York again. What an unlucky city. Doctor Strange is abducted and Wong doesn't seem to care that his friend is in danger and returns home... Really Wong, I'm so disappointed with you! Why doesn't he open up a portal to rescue his BFF? I know that Doctor Strange wouldn't have abandoned him... of course there is the fact that Wong's ten minutes were up and the studio couldn't afford him. Okay Wong I forgive you. Doctor Strange doesn't use his magic gem to turn back time and ""bargain"" with Thanos. Why doesn't he do it? With the help of Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Spiderman and Star Lord they hatch up a ""plan"" to remove the magic gauntlet off Thanos rather than just cut off the guy's arm off! Star Lord being the screw up that he is screws up the entire plan. Doctor Strange simply gives up the time gem because it's the only way to prolong this agonizing movie for another hour! Why didn't I just stop watching this movie?
Captain America who is a fugitive is suddenly pardoned because he is just so darn good looking and awesome in his costume. Vision says that he won't trade a life for a life but there were so many lives lost during the battle to remove the stone from his head. Wakanda is invaded and the Hulk refuses to come out of the closet... So why was he saved and not someone else? Does anyone care? Why didn't Wong and his friends appear in the final battle and lock the evil alien army into the ""mirror dimension""? I'm just saying... Everyone dies and we all know that they aren't going to stay that way. These movies get worse and worse each year.",

In the end it's just more of the same computer generated over the top smash and bash that appeals to 12 year olds or those that are stuck at that age. The first avengers was original. But now what Hollywood movie makers due best, take an original movie concept to cash in until death in franchising occurs. Sorry about raining on your Hollywood comic book Heroes block borer. But the only hero I can see is someone to say enough comic book sequels. They've become boring and predictable recycles. I spent more time thinking about how uncomfortable the theater seat was than being interested in the things blowing up in the movie. Seems Hollywood is addicted to CGI for making movies that shouldn't be made. If they keep going this way they could probably try selling a film of things just blowing up, no story, plot or actors acting just things blowing up.",

My girlfriend, who normally likes any superhero movie that's action-packed, even though this movie stunk. Many boring scenes of talking....all about nonsense. Because when every single character can do absolutely anything....when every character has powers that are limitless....like for instance, let's go to outer-space, let's teleport, let's shoot a rope that curves 20 times and wraps around our opponent....when anyone can do anything....the result is total boredom after a short while.

This ties in to not enough screen time, lack of emotional connection to the characters. I simply didn't care that half of the characters died by the end of the movie. Because we all know that most if not all characters are going to return anyway in future movies, it's a financial decision on Marvel's behalf. We all know that these characters are cash cows for Marvel studios so why care that they died when we all know they are going to come back anyway.... 3. Plotline, it had potential but due to time limits done by the studio and editing team it wasn't fully developed (Yes I understand half of you are going to say 'but I want my movie to be an hour and half and mindless fun'. and to rebut that, you can look this up here on imdb, 90%+ of movies that have made the most money and have the highest ratings are at least 2 and half hours long, most being over 3 hours so don't claim to represent the majority). 4. I would have liked this movie a lot more if they would have split it up into 2 movies, which would have been warranted with the material they were using in the movie.

Neither applauded, nor famous, even rejected by some, and, definitely, you would polarize the audience. On the other hand, you get some franchise fans who will accept you uncritically, guardians of everything that's included in the story. Look at what's happening with Star Wars.
Returning to Avengers, I see the scenario getting out of the accepted framework: they gave us 18 movies with the heroes of the Marvels universe (and movies about them) to kill them suddenly, unbalanced, easily.
The last ""Avengers"" resembles an episode of Dr. Who (older). I paraphrase it: in the last episode they destroyed the universe to revive it the following season.

This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level. In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second. It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop. 'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.",

Functionally, the wisecracks are tacked on to make the movies take on a ""lighter"" feel to contrast the darker themes they sometimes tackle. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with this approach, except that executionally the lines just aren't that funny, too frequent, tryhard, and awkward, sometimes even going as far as to ruin a potentially epic moment by cheapening it beforehand or afterwards. Not to mention that this formula for ""comedy"" is carbon copied across almost all modern Marvel movies, so it gets tiresome quickly.

The Marvel franchise went downhill since Iron Man 3 which hurts so bad considering he is my number 1. But this movie took the cake. There were so many inconsistencies, so many random characters which weren't introduced in the MCU (only in the comics). There were far too many big egos and sub plots to try and cram into one movie.

131,19 June 2021,ssatvaya-16480,10, Much better than END GAME,"AVENGERS:INFINITY WAR,to say in one line,is perfectly balanced as all things should be. It was the most anticipated movie of the decade,and it had to deliver what seemed impossible-bringing together two dozen superheroes,combining plot threads from the previous 18 films,introducing the biggest villain onscreen and perfectly balancing humor with emotions and action with drama-all in a single film-and the russos nailed it.... Mild Spoilers follows... The main attraction of the film ,is no doubt the Mad Titan. Thanos is not your usual villain. He is complex and multi-dimensional. He is cruel,ruthless,kills but at the same time, he mourns,shows compassion,and above all-he has a reason for his actions-and that's what makes him the most interesting and dangerous villain. He gets the most screen time than any other hero...It is as if he is the central character. Its as if we are following his journey of collecting the six infinity stones so that he can destroy half the universe. He wants to wipe out half of the universe,not because he sees fun in it nor he wants to rule. All he wants is to achieve balance in the universe. According to him if the universe is left unchecked,then the universe might destroy itself due to overpopulation. He wants to do this action so that the other half and the future generations can thrive....he describes it as mercy. Along with him ,the film also gave us sidekick antagonists in the form of black order. Among them,Ebony maw was cool to watch. The actions and choreography were amazing. If you thought the actions in the trailers were awesome,o boy...u aint seen nothing. The people behind the camera ..they did a fantastic job. The art work was good ...and the cgi and vfx looked realistic. They did a remarkable job in capturing all the facial expressions in josh brolins face. Nothing to say about screenplay...its just ....I cant imagine how they delivered it ..and like a star wars movie we got to see different parts of the galaxy-From the sanctum sanctorum to New avengers facility. From wakanda to New york. From Nevidilir to knowhere and from vormir to titan and finally to wakanda...The shifting of story from one scene to another scene and location without confusing the plot was executed perfectly. The dialogues were sensible..and the film is filled with lots of pretty and punchy one liners that will fill you with laughter,and some that will make you emotional. The character interactions...well this was what we wanted to see more than anything...and trust me ,the russo brothers delivered more than what we expected. Not only that, the film gives adequate time for characters to grow and develop in such a short time frame that you feel for each and every character ...its a treat for those who have followed all mcu films and had made the characters part of their life.....the interaction between these different characters is what makes this film unique.....there are reunions...there are first meetings..the plot is written as such that each and every character is vital to the story... The guardians get a lot of screen time...and Thor-guardians interactions are one of the best and most entertaining moments in the film .The trio formed by dr strange,peter parker and tony stark was also very amazing..The first meeting between earths mightiest heroes and the guardians of the galaxy is very funny ...The thanos-gamora relationship is very well explored ..the film also gives ample time to vision-scarlett witch romance that was teased in the trailers... captain america has a grand entry ..we get to see black panther...bruce banner ..o well he has his own arc in the film and is funny.. and so on...
Its the darkest and most emotional movie in the franchise..as the first scene itself sets the tone for the entire film. The stakes are higher than ever and the ENDING will just make you numb .....,
Its not just a superhero movie..Its a movie about love,relationship,sacrifice and above all asks a moral question- ""under what condition is it just to trade one innocent life to save others"".",

135,20 March 2021,judemcrobbie,10, You've seen it,"I have basically nothing but praise for Avengers: Infinity War. Considering the rest of the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) are very safe and don't take many risks or deviate from their generic formula, this does. These movies will go down in cinema history, for better or for worse, and I do truly believe this deserves to be there.
There are plenty of reasons this is the best MCU instalment and one of the better movies of the decade:
The primary reason is the villain, Thanos. He played spectacularly by Josh Brolin, who even in motion capture gets all the acting through. The MCU has had such weak villains throughout so to see Thanos done so well is a great change. I think the genius behind how Thanos is the best villain is because the way the movie cleverly poses the question ""Could he be right?"". This gives him not only a sense of moral righteousness to us but we can truly see the ""No one thinks they're the villain"" philosophy making him so compelling. The opening scene of the movie shows the mad titan effortlessly slaughtering families in his quest to destroy half the population of the universe. He seems completely unfazed by this like he's done it before countless times. There is a clever line of exposition in this after this, not only backing it up that he has (That we will see a flash back showing he's been doing it for at least 20 years) but also how he got the first stone. I like this decision to say rather than show this as it puts us in the action of the people we actually have emotional resonance with, The Asgardians. Throughout this scene we see the two previously strongest characters, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), get not only beat down by Thanos but humiliated. This is especially prevalent in the hulk as we don't see the fight between Thor and Thanos. We do get to see the fight between The Hulk and Thanos however. This is one of the best set pieces in the franchise as not only is it bombastic action but also shows character for both of them, but especially Thanos. Through a mere few counterattacks, Thanos decimates The Hulk. This shows the brains he has, not fighting like the animal The Hulk does, and showing he also has the strength to go toe to toe with the previous strongest avenger. The genius behind the decision to show the brains is that t circles back to when in the final fight he says ""You're not the only one cursed with knowledge"". In this scene we also see the smarts of Thanos, outsmarting the God of Mischief-Loki (Tom Hiddleston). He ultimately kills both Loki and Heimdall (Idris Elba), the final remaining people from Thor's previous life before the first Thor and the avengers. I think the next time we see Thanos on screen is in the Knowhere scene. In this he uses his grip over the weapons he has gathered, showing their abilities and his ability over them by cutting through The Guardians of the Galaxy (Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff) with ease and going as far as to turn our beloved Mantis and Drax into Spaghetti and just blocks respectively. There is a lot more in this scene which I could talk about, Peter's arrogance and the Guardians dysfunctional family ultimately leading to their downfall to the hand of a competent villain, but I will elect to talk on the emotional climax of the scene, Peter Quill attempting to kill the love of his life in order to save humanity but getting the rugged pulled out from underneath him. This leaves Peter in a complete state of disarray as if he had killed he would have felt immense guilt for killing the one true love of his life, and if he hadn't then he may have just doomed the universe. No win situations like these are perfect for developing character as we get to see them in difficult situations. This drives Peter and the rest of The Guardians the rest of the movie. There is two more Thanos scenes I would like to would like to talk about: the first of which is the Nebula torture scene. This is a truly perfect scene compared to the many others. Marvel has a tendency to crack jokes unnecessarily, which I'll get into later, but this is just completely devoid of all that humour which is just perfect. The fact Gamora says ""I always hated that chair"" and Thanos deciding to bring himself to the lower level, not feeling the need to assert his dominance over her sets up the next scene perfectly, and then the other thing in this scene is the decision for the 'Mad Titan' no to torture Gamora and instead torturing Nebula, again this makes the next scene perfectly. Then the final scene of the Thanos chat is the Vormir/Soul Stone scene. This scene is just chilling. When Red Skull (Ross Marquand) pronounces that you must give a soul you love for the soul stone, the reactions from both Thanos and Gamora are just amazing. Thanos goes completely silent, null and void he thinks over what he must do. The tear shed shows the pain perfectly set up in the previously alluded scene, but understanding he must do what he must do. In his eyes it means crossing the fate over the universe over his daughter and the only person he ever truly loved. Gamora in this scene is fantastic as well. She originally believes that Thanos doesn't love anyone and therefore he will fail, going as far as to taunt him about it. At the beginning the taunts come thick and fast but they slow down with her voice realising there's only one thing he loves. The climax of Gamora trying to kill herself instead of having to give the stone to Thanos is what makes the scene so great, giving the moral compass of The Guardians and she carries that to her grave ultimately.
Another reason for this being this being the best instalment in the franchise is because of the writing and acting for/from every character:
Iron Man is the man who started all this and Robert Downey Jr. gives a trademark performance. He brings the narcissism and arrogance that comes with the character. He also shows the swagger but more he brings arguably the fourth personality trait of Iron Man's tenure. This iteration brings the most human Iron Man. He has always had obsessions but in this the obsession is with having a child. This is started as far back as Captain America: Civil War (2016) with the introduction of Spider-Man (Tom Holland). In this Spider-Man was easily the youngest superhero, he was still in high school, so Tony Stark saw him as a child, which later became his child of sorts. This is emanated as the same you want to push your child but not to the point of harm, Tony brings Peter Parker into the fight to expand the help for Team Iron Man or whatever it's called, but at the first sign of real danger he tells him to leave. This is carried over to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) where we see Iron Man as the mentor, Uncle Ben figure of the MCU. To those who don't understand that, Uncle Ben in Spider-Man is the man who teaches Peter humility and ""With great power comes great responsibility"". Tony Stark has this trait in this as he teaches Peter not to thrill-seek and do it for the greater cause, what Tony Stark had to learn 9 years prior in the first instalment of the MCU, Iron Man (2008). I say all of this because he gets annoyed at Peter for getting on the spaceship as he is fully aware that it could be a one way trip. The line Peter says ""I can't be the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man if there's no neighbourhood"" encapsulates the lessons taught to him in the previous instalments of his character in other MCU movies. Then to see Peter die in his arms has to be the killing blow, comparable to losing a child. Not only does Tony feel this, but because of all the time spent developing their relationship in other movies and this one, we the audience also feel this like the dagger Tony Stark has just been stabbed with, both physically and emotionally. The back and forth between Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Iron Man is brilliant, it evokes the feeling when two of the worlds greatest but heads, like Messi and Ronaldo or Lebron and Curry. The ""I speak for myself"" from Doctor Strange is completely unnecessary and he just affirms Tony Stark's point but it shows however on the same tea, they are very much at each other's throats. This is even more apparent when in the spaceship Tony and Peter save Doctor Strange by blowing a hole and releasing the vacuum. Doctor Strange doesn't thank the pair but proceeds to make an indirect threat to them, saying he will not hesitate to not save them in aid to keep the Time stone. Also another 'alpha' character in Peter Quill joins them on Titan. This throws another problem as he has no willingness to listen to anyone but himself.
Thor is clearly fighting out of vengeance towards Thanos. Though not all by the hand of Thanos, in the last 3 features of Thor he has lost his father-Odin (Anthony Hopkins), his mother-Frigga (Rene Russo), his brother-Loki, and his four of his best friends in Heimdall and the warriors three (Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson and Tadanobu Asano). This man has seen everyone die around him so the guilt he must feel is through the roof. This is said by Mantis when trying to empathise with him. He is very much motivated in this by vengeance, it is because of this he is so powerful as he has ""Nothing left to lose"". This gives Thor the reckless abandon needle to take on Thanos alone or take the weight of a star to form his weapon. The will to take the weight, heat and energy of a star shows how much he was connected to Mjolnir. In very much way the the Tardis feels like a person in Doctor Who (1963-Present), Mjolnir had a sense around it that it was more than just a weapon, not just how Thor and it interacted but it's perfect timing and the noise it makes feeling like a language. Speaking of people Thor has lost, Mjolnir in Thor: Ragnarok (2017) was destroyed early by Hela (Cate Blanchett). There isn't enough words doc for me to get it all in",

was the person that created Thanos. Thanos kills to please Lady Death, he does not kill just because he thinks there's to many people, what a stupid idea that was.
I mean if he is worried about there not being enough resources for the population, once he has the infinity gauntlet, he can solve that by creating enough resources for
everyone! It would have been so simple to have Thanos worshipping Lady Death, her just silently watching, and him, as in the comics trying to gain her attention by 
killing to please her, but that was to complicated for the writers to put in, as audiences would not know who she was, lol. Self explained by Thanos, easily done, 
we've not seen the dwarf before, but he magically appeared, I mean, that was another waste of a whole sequence, Thor trying to get a hammer made (Beta Ray Bills 
hammer btw), I mean WTF, just have his proper hammer rejuvinate and hold the power, oh yeah, these writers wanted to change that part of the story as well.
These writers need to know, Stan, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko etc etc wrote and created these characters and they should stick to the original elements that made them

Many of the characters are likeable esp the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Hulk and Tony Stark BUT, there are just too many groups involved with too much repetition. The plot is mildly interesting daring to touch on overpopulation crisis. Thanos makes a good point. Though in true Hollywood style, he goes about it the wrong way. He should have sterilized half the planet, not dissolve them.",

166,13 January 2019,tfminfl,3, More of the same...,"303. Avengers: Infinity War. Heres what I get... There's a big cell phone game app fan out there named Thermos, he loves Bejeweled and Pokemon Go so much, that he decided to combine the two... search for the jewels in real life!! Collect them all, get free gifts, lives, reverse previous mistakes, you've played the games you know how they work. But little does Thermos know, the game apps feel him as a threat, once he collects all the gems, Thermos snaps his fingers and poof all the game apps Thermos doesn't like poof! Gone! So what happens is another app called the Avengers go after Thermos. Now I've played the game apps before, and I always thought that each Avenger had their own unique powers, which after watching this, they're all pretty much equal, and in most cases its the uniform they wear that gives them the power. So Thermos wants to delete half the apps because his cell's memory is almost full. Logical. But the Avengers being just an app themselves feel threatened, but luckily they can power up anytime, somehow they can change the pre existing uniform they wear to combat any situation they are in! Awesome. it all takes place within the Sims universe, obviously, because only the Sims would be oblivious to the alien invasion happening all around them and still go to work the next day, and the Avengers know they are just Sims, otherwise they wouldn't be throwing out one liners while the city and its population are being destroyed around them. In the end Thermos gets his way and kills off half of the apps!! Until he gets an upgrade on his cell for Avengers: Endgame, and/or Disney contracts are negotiated. Also loved the recreation of the battle scene from Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.

The Russo Brothers utilized some of the best tones the MCU has set, to really enhance the emotion and tention in every scene.

This movie has quite a bit of humor, but pretty much all of it worked very well to me. Normally when a marvel movie gets this long, it starts to get boring or it heavily drags during some points, but this movie is constantly moving towards the climax and really keeps you invested. I was so surprised by this, as I saw it with all of my high school buddies without many expectations of it.

More heroes, villains, battles, worlds, stars and CGI do not make a better movie. I really liked the first two avengers movies wich also did have a lot of heroes, but it had it's own style. This was a mix of everything that didn't really match. Thank god part 2 of this movie wich had a lot more of what Hollywood movies often tend to forget : a story, emotions, a twist, a plot,...

187,29 April 2018,pal05052003,10, A superhero movie that really makes you fear for the lives of superheroes,"Avengers: Infinity War manages to fix and upgrade superhero movies on many levels. First, it manages to deliver a truly intimidating villain with a good motivation. Thanos, played by Josh Brolin, is an upgrade of great Marvel villains such as Killmonger, who is human, and Hela, who is a goddess. Brolin's delivery is perfect, his voice is calm but intimidating and his performance makes you actually root for him. P.s. he gets to manhandle some of the most powerful Avengers. Second, Infinity War manages to raise the stakes like never before. Even Thanos' henchmen are formidable fighters and can take on any Avenger any time. Never before have I really feared for the lives of a superhero in a superhero movie. Third, all characters have enough screen time to allow them to shine and to remind you why they are heroes. Unfortunately, Black Widow does not get much material to work with, but she has a kickass fight in the end, so I am cool. Finally, despite the destruction, the movie manages to lighten the mood periodically so it does not get too depressing. The stirring musical score by Alan Silvestri is so well integrated to the movie that manages to rouse you without you noticing it. All in all, Avengers: Infinity War is probably the only movie where you really fear for all the heroes, but somehow also root for the villain.",

They're all ""super"" so no one is super anymore. And I feel some character have lost their true nature. Iron Man for example: what defines the character is his suit of armour, high tech sure, but still ""clunky"" and ""solid"". This new nano tech suit fits and looks like a soft glove: transition from a knight in armour to a well dressed, tailored character.

193,30 April 2018,olgavalentovaov,3, Thoroughly Disappointed,"This movie has certainly made history. A film that has so much going on and still manages to be boring just has to be some sort of a record. I went to the cinema with so much hope and enthusiasm and left wishing I'd kept my cash instead. The fact that so many characters leave no room for any sort of character development probably comes as a surprise to no one, and yet every single person in the film managed to annoy me at one point or another. The only exception to that rule was Stephen Strange, whom I've come to completely adore. I've always disliked Tony Stark so I was truly sorry I didn't get to see him disappear in a cloud of poop-colored dust but at that point I was almost beyond the point of caring. Black Widow, another one of mine top runners for the character I despise the most, thankfully did not have much screen time, and yet more than most. Spider Man - more like Pathetic Spider Boy, amirite - was once more delegated to being Iron Man's most faithful groupie, and poor Bucky had maybe three minutes of screen time (after finding out that Hawkeye was not actually in the movie, he was basically the main reason why I really wanted to see this steaming pile of hot garbage, so another disappointment there).
Also, considering the number of characters who died in this, we can be almost certain that they won't stay dead, otherwise Marvel wouldn't have anybody to make movies about anymore, unless they want to bring about Squirrel Girl. So any emotional impact any deaths may have caused was non-existent. Most of the jokes fell flat, and even though the storylines were woven together almost masterfully, it did nothing to disguise the fact that this flick was basically just another pathetic cash grab. And boring to boot.
And to add insult to injury, after I sat through the entire credits, I was treated to the promise of Captain Marvel. Horay. We don't need another character up in here, we really don't. And especially not Carl Manvers.

Still being rather skeptic, the ride started, and it actually seemed promising in the beginning. As the movie proceeds, however, it felt for me like a bunch of characters fighting, in a typical ""good vs. evil"" manner, while the bad guy, who had so much more potential, seems to be utterly evil with some seemingly emotional moments of redemption mixed in. The atmosphere in the movie IS dark, much darker than the previous Marvel movies, actually. There was an ""apocalyptic"" feeling throughout the entire movie. However, I was still shocked by the public that showed many emotions during the screening. There was something I probably missed in the movie. I have the feeling that Marvel Studios simply used some ""plot holes"" inside this movie for the sake of commercialization and further production of the MCU movies. Regardless, I would recommend watching this because many people find this to be the best thing that ever happened to the MCU.",

210,25 July 2020,adeckofcards,10, Superhero odyssey,"A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level.
In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second.
It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop.
'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.",
211,26 April 2018,oliverdimitri,10, THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER!!,"Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E's that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. 
So let's start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it's highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). 
Now, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you've seen in the previous marvel movies that aren't dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. 
And of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel's villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he's got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. 
I cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come. ",
212,10 May 2018,ocr-94520,1, Silly movie,It totally wasn't how i expected it to be. It's just a silly film with only action. Many cringy dialogues and dumb moments ruined the film. I felt really bad when yondu died in GOTG 2 but in this film never felt anything for anyone. So many died but i don't know why this film was in a rush and that's why their death didn't made me feel bad for them. They should have increased the runtime of the film. One of the worst thing is characters were not balanced. Captain america hardly had any dialogue. Hulk was shown only for 30 seconds in the entire film. There were many ways to stop thanos but hey he should look badass so let's make heroes dumb. Cgi was okay but in many places it looked cartoon-ish. In one scene it looked like Mark ruffalo's face is pasted on hulk buster. The film is full of plot holes.,
213,13 June 2018,yrwann,1, Can Disney Studios Depart Into The Porn Industry Already?,"Because guess what, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a straight up porn for any fan of cinématography. The plot is as simple, formulaic and stupid as it can get. There is a huge amount of holes, henny. The chemistry between actors (hence acting) is non-existent. All that we get - is a portion of idiotic choices just to excuse the upcoming ""ACTION"". Ye, baby, gimme more... These sweet fireworks and a talking piece of purple CGI is all I need. ",
214,26 November 2020,williammosedale,10, Thrilling,"Theres nothing that i can say about this film that hasnt already been said,a visual spectacle,yeah thats been said before,an amazing action,already been said but i would certainly recomend this film.",
215,12 November 2018,SerpentMage,2, WOW soooo bad,"I have no idea how this movie managed to get an 8.6. The story writing is exceptionally bad, and cliches used are dimes a dozen. It seemed a very rushed story involving too many actors and super heros. I do like super hero movies and do enjoy a good fantasy, but this was not it.",
216,5 May 2018,three_dead_crows,8," Do not believe the ratings, this movie is not nearly as good as people claim it is","In the end this movie proved to be an absolute slugfest that never stops. The action is nonstop and there is neither any buildup or climax to the action. This could have been redeemed if the actors had any time to do their jobs but they were never given any time to perform and so the characters are rather disconnected from their surroundings and their reactions ridiculous. The only character that is given time to evolve in this movie is Thanos, and he is an interesting figure and I fully approve of how they chose to adapt his motivations instead of following the comic books. But one character is not enough and as usual there is nothing on the line which is hardly surprising since they need to milk every cent they can out of the franchise, and I do not in any way blame them for this. But when the movie ends and not a single character have been killed except for heimdal I really can't bother with their cash grabbing ways any longer. For the people who actually believes that half the characters died i pity your stupidity, because it is painfully obvious that they will be revived in the next movie and everything will continue. 
 
The day marvel decide to actually have the heroes sacrifice crap and take responsibility for their actions is the day I will respect marvel. After watching this movie I feel that the correct way to continue is to make an entire movie about what an complete and utter failure Peter Quill is, just like they did with Danny Rand in the defenders.",
217,18 May 2018,sergew,1, Too simplistic!,"I'm tired of the comic based movie genre which further signals the death of original scripts and content. Don't get me wrong, originality alone does not make a good story. This movie continues to try squeeze water from a rock and I leave wanting so much more. The movie was much too long and especially the fight scenes. As in the old Wendy's commercial, ""Where is the beef?"", or in my case a good story and characters I care about.",
218,29 September 2019,billking6666,2, Not the Marvel I remember.,"Disney really went all out on this and the sequel. Thanos was a character introduced AFTER my time reading marvel Comics. His character is what we in the gaming world would call OP (Over Powered). How does destroying 50% of all life in the universe bring balance? The whole blasted plot was based on that silly premise! I am pretty sure I need to blame some obscure writers at Marvel for this ridiculous plot and character. The entire movie makes a mockery of science and even science fiction. Spoiler: The idea that you could collect 6 stones (which were created during the Big bang) and then snap your fingers to wipe out 1/2 of all life EVERYWHERE in the known (and probably unknown as well) universe takes witchcraft, sorcery and the supernatural to levels beyond anything within reason. Now where do you go Disney? You gave us a worst case scenario and any future villains will be mild by comparison. As with Thor Ragnarok you destroyed a future where Marvel has skipped over many villians and leapfrogged to the top, leaving a barren wasteland for future enemies to ""marvel"" at.",
219,4 May 2018,ikeanuhd,1, According to fanboys: as good as The Godfather,"This movie was litterly the same as the avengers and civil war. Nothing new here except that the hype is getting stronger??? By rules of nature hype must die down over time but marvel fanboys want more bad movies? Disney's board of director's and their shareholders are laughing their ass off. They acquire the rights of a universe with some superheroes en then they release 5 superhero movies a year that are complete and utter trash but its fanbase will love it no matter wat. now a cgi war movie (were we all now how of how it will end, it doesn't becouse Disney will keep spitting out these movies until marvel fanboys stop going to these trash movies.) Is considerd better than movies like Silence of the Lambs, Se7en, forrest gump and Leon??? Well if this is the case than i will leave this site and never come back becouse i use this site to see if a movie is worth seeing.

220,3 May 2018,tavm,10, Avengers: Infinity War is an excellent culmulation of all the previous movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"If you've read my reviews on this site over the years, you must've known that I love superheros and especially Marvel ones. So when watching this with my movie theatre-working friend, we were very excited to watch all those awesome characters come together to fight one really Big Bad one who cannot be easily defeated by just any one of them, one who goes by the name of Thanos. I mean, at the very beginning, someone is already defeated and by the end, well, it's not pretty, that's for sure! That end also seems to be a cliffhanger for the inevitable sequel that I know has already been made and is due next year. Great mix of humor and drama! I and my friend really enjoyed it so on that note, yes, go watch Avengers: Infinity War if you haven't already!",
221,22 May 2018,aikenkatie,1, Meh,"Not that great- WAY too long, too unengaging and too many plot holes-just too much period. I'm notorious for crying in movies;didn't even sniffle, and there were many ""deaths"" of my fav characters. ""Poignant"" scenes were all flat, I didn't buy into any of them at all. Always a bad sign when I'm checking my watch and realizing I still have to sit there for 45 more minutes- didn't even stay for the bonus at the end. Yawn! Knew I waited for a reason, and I'm sorry I saw this- the individual movies are light years better- would still pay to see Black Panther/ Captain America/ Wonder Woman again, and I've seen them multiple times already. Jmo, but meh. Pretty disappointed.",

Now take a slow peek beneath the 'hype' and what do you find?
You will see a repeat of what previous MCU chain movies offered:
Slick action and stunning visuals.
The producers know this mix works very well at the box office and so it comes to no surprise they apply this same formula again here. ",
224,17 November 2021,FishDrowned,8, Best MCU movie yet,Wow where do I start. The thought of bringing all the characters of many many movies hasn't been really explored in a more recent time. This is what the MCU has been building up for the many years. And the Ending is so perfect. I think it in-bodies the comic pretty well but at the same time manages to keep it as cinematographic as possible.,

""Can this movie stand alone without having seen at least 75% of the other Marvel movies?"" The answer is NO! 
I know I've seen most of Marvel's movies (loved Black Panther) but I think to enjoy this film you have to be a serious Marvel fan. Even with as many of the Marvel movies that I've seen, I still didn't have enough back story or character recognition to pull together this plot which seemed to me to just be an excuse to have CGI battles over and over. 
Then, to make matters worse, it's sooo looong. Add to that, that I need to see a sequel to see how this story ends and I hate it - 1 star out of 10 - done and done.",

229,21 June 2018,Vartiainen,9, How can this be so good?,"Quite honestly this shouldn't work. Marvel has been approaching its breaking point for a while now. By conventional wisdom there are too many characters, too many storylines, too many warring threats and points of interest. We could even kind of see it in The Age of Ultron. Too many plot points, too vast a scale, too far-reaching a scope.",
230,12 December 2018,CubsandCulture,5," Better than expected, but still a narrative and thematic mess","Everything about this movie was portrayed as bigger and more. Bigger Action! More heroes! The problem with that eventually more becomes less and the story collapses under its own weight. That happens here but not as much as I expected. The final film is coherent so there's that. It is also largely fun. There's that too. However, there is still too many sequence of the same stuff (get the stone!) and a lot of the film is very unwilling to play with the world it has set-up. Of note Dr. Strange and Thanos (post reality stone especially) are far too punchy. You can change the fabric of reality. Why do you insist on just punching people?",
231,28 April 2018,Lewis_Heather787,7, I don't know what to say!,"What did I just watch???? To be honest I don't think I can process everything and I'm not such if that is a bad thing or a good thing. To get it out there straight away I'm not a die hard fan of these films actually if anything I've losing more and more interest in the MCU as its gone on. I'm not quite sure why, just a lot of them are not for me but I can see why general audience love them, they are vey appealing. ",

Finally the day came and I watched the movie. For some reason I was completely bored. One fight after another. Lots of stuff blowing up. Lots of people running around. Characters blowing up and running around at the same time. Is it possible I have become overstimulated by this type of adolescent entertainment? Believe me, my girlfriend and I have a better relationship than some of the so-called romance subjects in this hyped up disaster movie.

The film was over-long and packed with way too much violence for what it delivered as entertainment. It also spent too much time focusing on the villain and his rationalizations for genocide.

237,26 May 2018,viithtrump,7," Could have been done better, and so many characters now...crazy","Marvel's biggest issue in my opinion is that there is just too much to take from comics, as it is a giant cluster mess. There is so many marvel characters now that some are just not that great and they shouldn't exist. Black panther is a yawn, and same with the second iron man (pure stupid, along with a 3rd in Banner? Are you kidding me right now?) and new younger spiderboy (even more dumb), which I feel shouldn't be in this series. Then you have that assasin girl (stupid, not even a super hero, just some average joe with moves stronger then aliens? Cmon hollywood!) Speaking of spiderboy (he doesnt deserve to be called man) He should have enough strength and then some to pull that glove off that Thanos hand easily. As i was saying too many plots to pull off. Too many unknowns left on table because of Dr. Strange. No antman was strange too...No real explanation of some things too, like the reality stone. The movie worked, but sloppily in terms of things. Without Thor this movie would have been not very good. There is a reason why Asgard was set on top of the Tree, as they are the most powerful. I really think they are headed for clash with like Galactus and other bigger enemies and when Fox is bought out by Disney it will lead to the Xmen joining too, gets bigger and worse. Good luck.",

It's a reminder of how far the MCU has come in 10 years and this movie capitalises on its bloated, but beloved cast to draw you in. Every character gets their own moment to shine a little, the dizzying, vibrant comic book action is satisfying and defies conventions. While admittedly, this darker chapter in the Marvel movie-verse is oddly paced and suffers from the occasional tonal inconsistency, all issues can easily be forgiven as almost each scene is a sizeable dosage of fan service. Josh Brolin as Thanos deserves all the attention he gets, as he is a villain with a tragic story to tell. For really the first time, the consequences are felt and resonate long after the credits roll. non-stop comic book action and surprising emotional depth. While a little uneven at times, its beloved cast, outstanding villain and sheer scope never underwhelm and the end product is something truly epic.",

247,29 April 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,9," Bold, brazen and ballsy stuff that isn't afraid to go dark; incredibly thrilling, nail-bitingly tense and satisfyingly unconventional.","'Avengers: Infinity War (2018)' is bold, brazen, ballsy stuff that's dark, daring and manages to deftly dodge all of the deep chasms that come with having the sheer amount of characters it has, all with rich histories and personalities as different from one another as their respective films are from this. It's remarkable how well it keeps each of these in focus while also keeping them true to who we know them to be, amalgamating their presences perfectly with this new tone so that nothing is lost yet nothing stands out. Admittedly, many of even the key players don't have much to do but all of them are well drawn and exist within the world in a tangible space, fulfilling their roles in the best way they possibly can. It feels as though this is the best version of a film with over twenty core characters that could have been accomplished. Besides, it's actually Thanos that's the 'star' and that is an unconventional and unexpected move. It's also one that pays off as he is easily the best, most intimidating and most understandable villian in Marvel's history. You empathise with him, on the most human of levels at times, and can even understand his point of view, just not his methods, whilst fearing his might as it lives up to all the hype it's been given. There's a real sense of forward-momentum and a proper pacy tension propelling the picture, leading to a series of confrontations that may be almost entirely digital but feel fully palpable thanks to excellent CGI and phenomenal writing. The script sets the stakes pretty much perfectly, weaving the interpersonal character motivations with the overall universal threat, and it paints a picture of a layered, all encompassing situation in which all our players play a part. It all comes to an unexpected and deliciously downbeat close, too. This is only dampened slightly, in execution and perception, because of the flick's 'Part I' nature - as well as the announcement of a few post-'Part II' MCU titles - which is actually the source of most of the film's minor issues. Without the context of the next film, there are some elements that don't quite seem 'real', but this could just be that they haven't sunk in yet because we don't know if they will be backtracked by the sequel or if they will be solidified by it. Still, as it is, this entry in the series is perhaps the most unconventional and unexpected flick the MCU has ever produced, one that stands on its own as a ballsy blockbuster unafraid to divide its audience. The tone is almost perfect, incredibly dark but with a dash of levity where it's called for (this is how you do 'serious', DC), and the pacing is great, too, even if it feels a tad long at times due to the unusual structure. It's just a breathlessly entertaining, incredibly thrilling, nail-bitingly tense, hopelessly jaw-dropping, edge-of-your-seat roller-coaster that does all of its characters, and its legacy, justice. Not to mention Alan Silvestri's phenomenal score. 9/10",

Probably won't happen....I can dream however....and I won't bother with going to the movies for AVENGERS: Thors Shower.........and I can't wait for Thanos to become a 'good guy'........plot makes less sense then a bugs bunny cartoon...I give the dribble factor a 9........,
249,5 May 2018,arthuradam,4, Terrible,"If I am to get to the point, the movie was noisy audibly and visually. It felt like a Michael Bay movie where he creates a false sense of excitement by wildly swinging the camera around with nauseating shots that last a few split seconds, leaving the viewer confused as to what is happening on screen. 
There's a balancing point in a movie with CGI and this movie has too much of it. Nothing feels real or organic. Much of the movie is like watching a children's morning cartoon. 
Too much was crammed into the movie. Every minute you're in a new area in space or on a ship. I savoured the non action scenes where people were talking to each other.
Wakanda? I never read the Black Panther comics and I am not sure if the movie represents the comics, but wow, what an embarrassing part of the movie for black people. These Africans are so advanced that they fly spaceships and tell Bruce Banner, a genius, his folly in relation to brain surgery while working on Vision. Is this supposed to come across as condescending to blacks because it was super cringe-worthy. I mean, it's kinda like dressing up a 5-year old as a professor and telling him he is the smartest person on the planet. And for these people to be so advanced, why are they using spears? I realise why Black Panther was always a 3rd tier comic now.

263,3 August 2018,frank_kneepkens,1, It's all for the money,"Very angry after watching this movie. It's a trend, started by Netflix, now Marvel also sees a good money making formula to force people and Marvel fans to keep watching and buying the stuff. The formula is this: make a (potential) good storyline, use good actors and great cgi but then make an open end, ready for a sequel. I'm sorry but then there is no real satisfaction after watching the movie. Normally (especially) Marvel movies end well, the good guys win, the bad guys loose. In the old days you get a good feeling and have 2 hours of good entertainment. You can replay the movie back in your head and repeat that good feeling. No not any more, all for the money, more more, make (force) the people longing for the next episode. I'm ok with that with series, but NOT for movies. Movies need to have a satisfactory good end. That is why you watch 2.5 hours of movie. It's that I could watch this for free with friends, but in a cinema I would demand my money back. What would people say if you buy a book and there is no end, you need to buy another book for the end, it's the same thing. So that is why I rate this movie a 1, even though all my favorite Marvel characters are in, lot's of humor, super CGI and everything looks great for a 10 rating, until the last few minutes. It really ruin everything before it back to the lowest rating. Oh and please, it has nothing to do with that ""I don't understand"" the movie. I understand the financial reasons for doing this very well!",

The prequels felt more like getting the most out of all the destruction that the super-heroes could inflict on their cosmic adversaries. That formula's still at work here but it seemed a lot fresher with the team-up between The Guardians and The Avengers, while Thanos (Josh Brolin) brought a decidedly different dimension to his role as an intergalactic enforcer.

The emotional roller coaster that begins right at the beginning of the movie to the very end has you feeling more and more frustrated and on edge as it goes on.

Still, there are huge pacing issues but it's a comic book movie with a lot of characters so i've got to give it a pass. But my biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't feel like an ""Avengers"" movie- they're all split up and such. The theme barely plays and when it does it doesn't feel quite right. The Russos don't really understand what the Avengers are, based on this movie. It doesn't feel quite as complete as the previous two.

297,22 May 2018,ThisisFizban,4, Some decent fight scenes and a few funny parts but that's about it,"There's something odd about Infinity War and a lot of other Marvel films and it's hard to put my finger on it. But after thinking about it, here's an analogy. It's like watching a sports game where the top seeded team plays the lowest seeded team. If you're a fan of the top seeded team, then it's an amazing game. It's a very safe experience. You get to watch your team decimate their opponent. Every play is fun to watch and you leave feeling superior and satisfied. As an example I'll point out the first action sequence in Winter Soldier. Captain America jumps out of an airplane without a parachute like he's headed out to pick up the morning paper. When he lands on the ship of bad guys it looks like he's just in a casual daily sparring exercise. I felt no tension at all that he was in danger or that he couldn't take the entire ship down by himself. But here's where Marvel has it figured out. It LOOKS cool and impressive. Each kick and punch is thrown highly stylized and well choreographed. That is the problem there in general with Infinity War and others. I'd say I like about half the Marvel movies just to put that out there. To put things in contrast I'll bring up the show Agents of Shield(which sadly has been more or less cast out by Marvel). The writing on the show can be somewhat repetitive but what they do get right is the tension(and the amazing characters). Every season they put them through absolute hell over and over and over to the point where I don't know who is going to survive and even if they do, how will they recover emotionally? I'll frantically binge watch a season in like 2 weeks, staying up till 3 AM each night and then get mad at myself that I'm too tired to continue watcing. I don't feel this with the Marvel movies. But like I said before, Marvel has discovered that they don't need to make a tense storyline or deep relate-able characters. Really it's all about showcasing everyone's favorite character be dominant and show off their powers. One of the problems with Infinity War is that it felt like a sports game where they were giving out participation awards. Back in the day I was an avid comic book reader. And I knew that there was a wide range of characters with varying levels of powers. Some stronger, some medium and some without powers at all. It brought tension and interesting dynamics to the stories because why in the heck would Captain America take on Thanos head-on seriously? Cap is a smart guy. He's not that stupid. As far as super abilities Cap is on the lesser end. Similar to Batman in many ways. He uses his intelligence, speed and fighting ability most of all. But he knew his limitations and his comic book had a raw relate-ability that other comics didn't. The fact that Cap actually beat the crap out of Iron Man in Civil War is absolutely preposterous. So there were many moments in Infinity War where super heroes were treated on equal levels when they shouldn't have been. I have some other criticisms of the movie like how all minor villains were completely forgettable. I don't know their names or really much anything about them. And Black Widow continues to annoy me with her invincibility and the fact that she is so American it's cringe worthy. And Thanos' supposed sacrifice of Gomorrah and his inner pain that was trying to pull on my heart strings? Yeah not very believable. The movie wasn't terrible... just to clarify. But the main thing I wanted to point out is that many people are saying this is a great movie and well that's your opinion but maybe it's just a great looking movie and you enjoy it because you get to see your favorite heroes kick butt. But does that make it a good movie though? You could argue that it did have tension because at the end half of the characters die. By the time all that started happening I already knew that Marvel doesn't have the guts to kill of anyone major. They'll all be back in the next movie :)",
298,31 December 2018,freddfoley,6, Bad Movie,Unlike the majority of people I honestly really disliked this movie. I felt it was far to crammed because of how many characters where in it and that Thanos was not a good villian. I believe Thanos was not a good villian because the directors made him so sympathetic that I was struggling to believe that he could do the horrible things he wanted to do because one moment he'd be crying about letting Gamora die and the next moment he'd be happily planning to wipe out half the universe! Also because the decimation (Official name for the Snap) wiped out all the new characters no one is expecting the snap to be permanent so it removes the tension of what will happen next in Avengers End Name,

300,28 January 2019,tabuno,7, As a standalone movie was a disappointment,"As a likely minority in the over-rated super-hero extravaganza, Infinity War as a standalone movie was a disappointment. It pandered to the audience with simple script devices where the superheroes were made to look pretty stupid, uncertainly un-Jason Bourne like in mentality and behavior. The evil ones were able to convenient arrive just in time to continue the storyline that could have easily ended multiple number of times at any number of points if these multitude of conglomerate, almost innumerable superheroes could actually learn to work together and obtain the oneness that comes of Buddhist, Eastern cultural wisdom of the importance of society over the individual. The backstory of Thanos and his daughter was too brief and insufficient to provide a more complex and bonded emotional connection is one problem. And another problem is simply too many superheroes that almost makes the movie more about heroes becoming the norm instead of super. It's almost now about many people who appear to be super but the movie is populated with so many of them that really it seems that they are normal people with extraordinary differences that the audience has seen so often that they almost appear normal now, nothing really special anymore, something the audience just comes to expect. Overall, the movie substantively is pretty superficial and the plot while challenging includes too many cliques and uneven tone from a chaotic fusion of trying to be so cute and funny, to serious and emotional riveting so much so that it becomes neither.",

Marvel movies have been at the top for years now, and this is the peak. I was so excited to see all these characters meet for the first time and take down Thanos. For me, this is the best way to introduce the Infinity War story. There was so much characters and subplots, and there was no pacing issues and the story didn't get lost in itself. This movie could've been three hours plus, but putting it all together in two hours thirty minutes is a real achievement. I was never bored too; there was action right in the beginning to the end. I know a lot of the non-comic moviegoers are going to hate this movie, because they had no idea that Thanos would kill everyone, luckily I knew what was going to happen. I think it was a hard decision for Marvel to take this direction; due to the criticism of the naive moviegoers, salute to Marvel. The thing is, if Marvel never explained all of the characters, then this could've ended up as a failure. We knew all of the characters and plots. Marvel explained every bit to the audience through multiple movies. Marvel took their time to explain and not confuse the audience. DC didn't do that with Justice League, there was no hype for that, because there were no ""Multiple movies"".",

Also too many times, before he had the full set of rings that Thanos could have been shot but no, everyone politely waited until he was aware of their presence (eg when he is talking to Gomorra and Star Lord is standing there with a loaded gun doing nothing!!!). I cried at the end of GOTG 2 when Yondu died, but this movie almost trivialised death, it was an emotionally vacant experience. I love both Marvel and DC universes but this missed in too many ways to be engaging, Justice League a clear winner. a final thought, the music was also draggy which didn't help, I came out thinking I may well see the follow up on DVD. My favourite bits were the different groups meeting each other and finding out that Thor speaks Groot.

I won't waste my time and money on the next one.",

The main battle scene: Horrible. The battle scene looked like it was left over from the ""Phantom Menace"". Frankly, if you are in Africa, and you are a rich country, why not call South Africa to send some of their close support aircraft. Pretty sure the South African Gripen's would have dealt with the interstellar scum pretty quickly. The superheros and the Africans all seemed to be using military tactics without noticing that WW1 and WW2 had produced the concept of aircraft that deliver large bullets and bombs. 
Other items about the battle scenes just pulled me out of the picture time and time again.
There is little room anymore in this franchise to recover.

They are stretching out this story into two parts.,"The movie had some good character moments but aside from Thanos' story arc, which was interesting, the movie was a convoluted mess. And not even all of the action kept me from yawning. Dr. Strange had some great action scenes but for the most part the choreography in this film was nonexistent and sloppy. And If people thought the humor in the Last Jedi was out of place then you will really be disappointed here. Unlike Thor Ragnorok, the humor in Infinity War was for the most part; not funny and it came up at wrong moments in the film, which removed the seriousness in certain situations. ",

And despite a dark premise there's lots of laughs along the way as well as tears. From the opening moments you know the game is real. The events are shocking and yet it's still exciting to see our favorite characters come together especially a hilarious Thor and star lord and a lovable and heartbreaking spider man. But the real goods belong to a wonderful layered Robert Downey Jr. The best thing about this film is that it leaves you wanting the next chapter desperately.,

337,1 August 2018,sheppard-2,5, Disappointing ending and lots of logical inconsistency,"Well, this movie is certainly entertaining and packed with action and expensive visual effects. It also gathers superheroes from several comics in one place. This feels both fresh and random. It also feels like each character is less interesting, because the writers had to write for so many characters, and they had to spread their effort instead of focusing it. The only actually funny characters here are the guardians of the galaxy, and they are still pretty shallow. The villain team looks like some orcish/undead characters straight from some fantasy video game. The ending might seem like a fresh move for some people, but to me it was just very underwhelming. Not unexpected, no twist, just ""to be continued"", and also on the verge of justifying genocide. This already makes the movie not really worth watching. You get entertained, but it's shallow and empty. And besides that, there are lots of logical inconsistencies. And the biggest one is why would they even fight throughout the whole film? The outcome of their fight is completely inconsistent with their effort. Then, why does the main villain use his powers in some cases and instantly undoes everything that the good guys try to do upon him, but in other cases he just wrestles with them as if he has no superpower at all? And gets no damage most of the time, except one moment where he gets a tiny scar. This really lowers the stakes. All in all, there's no need to watch this movie.",

I had to put my input as well and agree that this film does not deserve a high rating as IMDb's users are placing it to be. This movie is tiring in both a good and bad way. Too much action crammed in a 2.5 hour movie. This story should have been serialized or someplace like Netflix where they can hash out a story in an episodic format, like a comic book. I agree with others with plot holes, but we must remember that this is a comic book movie and you have to expect that.

The film is packed with many hero characters, that sometimes makes the viewer struggle to work out how they all fit into the script. You have to have watched the previous Marvel movies, in sequence, to recall each characters role and ""powers"". This is a long movie, but it is an action rollercoaster. I have to say that the ending is in true Marvel movies tradition; it is like wadding through extra thick treacle, it is that slow and drawn out. But, it is clever in that it keeps the view hooked and on the edge. It seems like this is it, game over, but we shall see. As I said, this is a really good movie, perhaps the best from Marvel Movies in my opinion, I really enjoyed it. The special effects are just superb, the storyline is full of twists and turns, and all the different actors brought together works in perfect motion.

365,29 April 2018,n-kefala,5, Too much of everything,"Though surprisingly rich, the film's storyline remains incomplete. Feels more like several movies squished together. ""Avengers: Infinity War"" isn't a perfect film, but it's probably exactly what it wants to be. A massive spectacle full of fun character moments and impressive action sequences. It is an entertaining movie but one that leaves too many unanswered questions. Also it is too long, too dark and too confusing but the humor and all star cast helps you endure the overrunning length. On the whole, ""Infinity War"" is what fans have been clamoring for - an action movie that puts everyone under one cinematic roof, that puts all the good guys against the ultimate big bad for a better universe.",
366,21 February 2019,Emma-M-V,5, Just not that enjoyable,"There are obviously good things about this movie - a lot of talented people worked on it and especially in the scene design there is a lot to like. But there are a lot of problems too.
For one it feels disjointed, as if there are scenes that have been uncomfortably cut out. Only a few characters get introduced, and just a few more get what feels like a decent amount of screentime and dialogue. With Cap for example, his role feels extremely insignificant - as if he as a character could have been replaced with any other Avenger performing the same actions and nothing would change.
I thought Vision's and the Witch's romance was pretty inoffensive and sweet. I was surprised at how much of a role they had, but the actors did very well at making me see them as real characters, which was at times difficult with some of the more main-cast characters.
On the other hand Tony gets an uninteresting and cheesy as hell intro that easily could have been pared down, he and Strange have a stupidly prolonged dickwagging segment and Banner's way to frequent attempts at humor made me wish somebody would shoot him in the face already.",

368,5 May 2018,ironhorse_iv,9, Avengers: Infinity War is a Comic Book Triumph. Everything nearly assembled flawlessly.,"Ever since Walt Disney Company purchase Marvel Studios in 2009; they have been on a blockbuster roll, with their comic book movies. Their Cinematic Universe lead by producer, Kevin Feige has introduces countless amounts of superheroes and their stories to vary amounts of success. In return, every standalone & 'Avengers' assemble movie, the studio had made, has been built up to lead up to an all-encompassing climatic arch, in which big villain, Thanos (Motion Capture & Voice Acting by Josh Brolin) will one day, come to control the universe, through the use of six powerful infinity stones. Most of those films in their Phrase One & Two, kinda work, as they help push the apocalypse doom subplot, in a somewhat foreshadowing constant rate. However somewhere, in Marvel Studios Phrase 3 film campaign, that story thread began to lose some ground, as more popular & recent Marvel Comic story elements were put in the foreground like 'Civil War' & 'World War Hulk'. Because of that, it really felt, like Thanos threats of worlds domination storyline was not only coming at snail pace, but simply, delay, more and more, in order to milk more cash out of establish standalone films. Not only, was this decision, causing, doubt that this assemble movie would ever get release, but it was also, making people, wonder, if the film can be possible to be made. Finally, in 2017, we got our answer, as one of the biggest & the most ambitious film projects ever undertaken start to take shape with screenwriter, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and directors, Anthony & Joe Russo with their crew on hand, shooting back to back with a direct sequel. In 2018, on the ten year anniversary of the Studios first cinematic universe movie 2008's 'Iron Man', 'Avenger: Infinity War' was finally released to the public. Without spoiling the 19th overall film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, too much, it did live up to the hype as one of the best entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe yet. It was somewhat accurate to the first half of the 'Infinity Gauntlet' comic book story, written by Jim Starlin, minus the absence of some key characters, like Adam Warlock, Silver Surfer and Mistress Death. Hopefully, they are in 2019 sequel. As for length. For 3 hour film, it was also surprisingly, well-paced. However, there were some really confusing exposition dump parts in the film that seem really odd. It seem like the movie cut a lot of sequences. One of them, involving the Nova Corp & the Power Stone, and the other, concerning the Soul Stone & Thanos's daughters. This also, includes the after credit ending, with the hints to Captain Marvel. Those parts really did seem like to come out of left field. Despite that, while, the movie does jump around, a lot; every scene was a very heart pounding experience built on many amazing heroic characters having to deal with such devastating stakes, in their own unique ways. Surprisingly, the movie gave, enough screen time to, nearly all the marvel characters, without, turning into a giant mess of a film. It's also truly unique, in how well, the writers, fully introduced the villain with all the heroic characters, having to deal with him, one way or another. The screenwriters really did flesh out, Thanos from a cartoony over the top, out there simpleton baddie, into a believable down to earth, well verse, complex nemesis through his fatherhood subplot. Not only that, but Brolin's acting is so commanding, that he really seem like a serious threat with his voice. It was a huge improvement, since his last appearance. He's the best Marvel villain, yet. Even as a special effect character, Thanos kinda moves as if he's really there. The only scene, that kinda look fake with him, was, in the beginning, when he was choking out, a character. As for the good guys, the CGI suits on Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) & Spiderman (Tom Holland) could had look a little more realistic. It was given off, a 2011's 'Green Lantern' vibe. Other than that, all the action scenes with them, and the other CGI characters such as Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Groot (Voiced by Vin Diesel) & Rocket (Voiced by Bradley Cooper) were compelling enough to overlook the CGI spot fest. As for full make up performers like Dave Bautista (Drax), Karen Gillian (Nebula) and Zoe Saldana (Gamora). They did well in their scenes. As for Paul Bettany's acting was alright as Vision, but his makeup, was still a bit off. As for live action performers such as Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) & Starlord (Chris Pratt) and others. Every performer in this movie did a great job in their action scene & their acting. Even, the Stan Lee & Peter Dinklage cameo was great. I have no complains about that. As for the humor, it was fine. Lots of laugh out loud moments for a surprisingly dark film. As for the depressing bittersweet ending. I love it! While, a lot of diehard fans and young children might find, this climax to be upsetting. Just note, to take it, with a grain of salt. It's a comic book movie. There is always, going to be some kind of McGuffin or Ex Machina to bring them back. I just glad, Disney took the risk, rarely than play it safe. It was broad to subvert expectations. Overall: The movie was an exceptional achievement that somehow leaves you both fully satisfied and desperate for more. In the end, 'Avengers: Infinity War' ranks among the best adventures, we've seen yet from this stellar franchise. I can't wait for the next movie. I highly recommended seeing this.",

Here I am six years after The Avengers, Infinity War tickets go on sale and I buy two for the BFI IMAX in Waterloo for me and my girlfriend. I walked into this movie with nothing but high expectations and they were all met. This film benefits from the existence of the other 18 films in this illustrious franchise. It builds upon every single character thread and arc laid down in previous films. No theme is left untouched and no character is left without their traits and quirks. Time has left it's toll on some and has barely graced others. Iron Man's unwillingness to let go of the life he stepped into 10 years ago shows in his absolute eagerness to step into battle with his new nano-suit. Captain America's optimism has wavered but his ability to fight for what is right hasn't. The romance between Wanda and Vision doesn't feel random or forced because their connection has been present since Age of Ultron and especially Civil War. ",

It gives you everything you want, it gives all the heroes perfect amounts of screentime, it has a perfect villain with motives you can understand and even support, the fights are one of the bests in the entire MCU, even despite watching it like 15+ times, I still have chills when all the heroes appear, on all the fights, when thanos gets another stone and specially on the ending. Watching this movie is literally one of the best experiences you could ever have.",
378,28 September 2022,tylerdburns-81322,10, Perfection,"The twenty ninth entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Avengers: Infinity War is damn near perfect. The special effects are breathtaking, with several new planets seen, each one with a unique environment. The dialogue is some of the best seen in any film, not just from the MCU. The villain, featured as a side character in three previous installments, is one of the best offered by the MCU, with complex motives and a moving backstory, who also believes he is on the right side of history. Seeing all the Avengers reunite for their greatest threat yet, with the newer faces of the Guardians of the Galaxy, is spectacular. All in all, this is one the few examples of the perfect Marvel film, and just films in general.",
379,2 May 2019,undeaddt,9," Up there, shoulder to shoulder with Captain America-Civil War","Arguably, the best MCU movie ever made, and yes, I watched Endgame. Many people say Infinity War is the action and Endgame is the brain and I agree totally with that, but in Endgame there are many things that can be questioned, the decisions, things that did not make sense, things that can't be explained, some rushed choices and many more. But Infinity War is perfect, it is balanced, it is well written, it is action-packed and the most important thing, it never gets boring, not for a single second. There is always something happening, something big and exciting, heart pounding and stressful. There is happiness and there is grief, there is team work and there is power. Incredible re-introduction of all the characters that we've seen throughout the MCU journey with some of the most amazing visuals and CGI effects ever seen in the movie theaters.",
380,1 May 2018,CardinalsBaseball,2, Grade - Incomplete,"This is an incomplete film. Thanos is collecting the 6 gem stones, which can magically do anything for the possessor. The Avengers, Guardians and anyone else you can think of are out to stop him. That is the entire crux of the film.
 Thanos' motivation is that he wants to eliminate half of the universe's population under the notion that it will somehow cure poverty and starvation. This premise is asinine, however. Earth was half of it's current population a mere 50 years ago, and poverty and starvation was an even bigger problem at the time, than it is today. If he really was concerned with the ratio between life and natural resources, why not increase the amount of resources? Either way you look at it, the motivation was incredibly asinine and poorly thought out. Regardless, that's Thanos' master plan and the heroes aim to stop him. From the very beginning, however, they fail miserably. By movie's end, Thanos has won; he has all of the gems and half of the universe is dead, including all of Asgard and at least half of our heroes. The End. Seriously, that's the end. 
 Now most folks recognize that the carnage and death in this film will be undone in the next movie. Dr. Strange likely cast a spell on his gem that will start mucking about with time and reality and they will somehow make things right again in time for those Black Panther and Guardians of the Galaxy sequels. But that's a completely different film and that just belies the significance of this film even further, Films should stand on their own. Infinity War doesn't do that. If you get off seeing the heroes getting their asses kicked and dying while the bad guy wins at the end; then this is the film for you. I think that's the sort of story that would only appeal to someone who enjoys tearing the wings off flies.",
381,12 May 2018,holgerscholl,1, Utterly disappointed,"So, this was it, the culmination of a decade of Marvel movies preparing and leading up to this final showdown? Well, I could not be more disappointed.",
382,21 November 2021,patrick-91640,4, Assembly-line work,"Yeah, I get it: the bigger picture, the grand finale, and how it all wraps up the entire mcu saga that was build up for so long.",
383,10 August 2018,fmbr-1,4, Deeply flawed,"There are two types of stories where the hero doesn't save the day. Horror and documentary - horror because the villian is far too powerful to begin with, but even then is usually thwarted by the last of the survivors it has chosen to torment. The other is documentaries, because they are based on real events - but usually the heroes win, because they write the histories.
This film is neither and while others applaud the boldness of letting half of the universe get snuffed out, I would say that if the studio was truly bold it would not release another film featuring the characters it so casually got rid of. As it is, this 'boldness' costs them nothing more than thinking of some BS excuse to bring them back, and we are all the poorer for it, for if they can be brought back once, why not twice? Why not over and over again? Death has no meaning to these heroes, they'll be back as long as writers can dream up an excuse.
Further, I object to Thanos' loony idea. Kill five billion people on Earth (half is less but then there are airline pilots that disappeared, people killed in traffic because of crashes, etc. etc. Within 100 years, the population will be pushing 8 billion again. He hasn't stoped the problem, merely delayed it for a little while.
However, the problem isn't even real. Thomas Malthus published his 'Essay on the Principle of Population' in 1798 predicting that people would run out of food - yet today, we produce far more food than we can use (even if it was sent to feed the hungry in areas of famine).
Finally, Thanos doesn't even have the courage of his convictions. If he believed that it was for the good of the universe, he should have volunteered that he be the first taken. The fact that he isn't means that he doesn't believe and is also a coward.
Truly this is the worst of the Marvel films to date.",
384,29 April 2018,macakanobi,10, 10/10 Awesome epic adventure from start to finish..!,"10/10 and this is why..! I've watched this film three times now so I can get a true picture of it and honestly I enjoyed it more, the more I watched it. To juggle a huge cast this size and make it work is an accomplishment, and boy is this an accomplishment.",
385,7 October 2018,computermech,3, Falling asleep in the middle of the movie,Very confusing story. In my personal opinion Thor should have long hair. Captain America should not have a beard and wear his uniform. Hulk should be more powerful than what was shown on this movie. Ironman's nano tech suit is a joke. The Avengers seem to have no powers in this movie.,
386,20 August 2018,kirbylee70-599-526179,10, THE WAR BEGINS,I will admit to feeling a certain amount of joy the first time I watched THE AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR. Having just watched it a second time I can let those who felt the same that it holds just as much impact the second time around. No doubt it will on repeated viewings as well. It is that good of a movie.,
387,7 July 2020,nahumthebest,9, the final battle in this movie was great and very enjoyable and it is only topped by its sequel which offered a truly EPIC battle of APOCALYPTIC proportions,I have always felt Marvel VILLAINS that hit the big screen were laughable. And then came Thanos - finally a formidable opponent that was to be taken seriously.,
388,11 May 2018,holgerscholl,1, Really? This was the culmination of 10 years of Marvel movie story telling?,"Completely disappointing. A few mildly witty or funny scenes. The rest a sum of dumb and unwitty fights against an enemy who is already too strong at the beginning of the movie and only gets stronger during the film. The only suprises are negative ones, No resolution at the end of the film. Many dead. And now years to wait for a sequel...? My personal rating: Not worth the money.",
389,29 April 2018,Adenney19355,4, Horrible ending... wish I would have waited for it to wind up on Redbox,Movie was good until the ending. Absolutely sucked. I would have much rather had them make a 4-5 hour movie than have them leave it like they did. After that ending I'm not sure I care to watch anymore Marvel movies. And if I do ever watch more of them I'll wait until they're on Redbox or at my local library so that way I don't have to pay an arm and a leg to potentially suffer this kind of disappointment from a movie again.,

392,11 July 2022,dakuchonekobing,9, Wonder how many movies like this Marvel can create? Maybe never,"This is the result of 10 years. And it's incredibly effective. When you create a good enough villain, the superheroes around him only need to appear for a few seconds. But everyone knows these heroes well, they all have their own movies that have been released before. So can I consider this a solo movie about Thanos lol.",

395,4 August 2020,WasiReviews,9, Adventure Awaits,"Infinity War had a lot to offer with stunning cgi that basically made the entire film apart from the heroes heads animated but done so well it looks real. The adventure the quest the ultimate event, and over ten years of waiting for the MCU to finish. Thanos really makes you question your morals... if you're twelve years old and don't understand the myth of overpopulation and genocidal tactics. The action and heros are a welcome inclusion and yeah this movie was kicka**. Not as good as Endgame but close.",

400,24 April 2019,minister_of_silly_walks,10, A cinematic feat like no other,Another hit by Marvel assembling the Avengers against one of the most intimidating movie villains in history - Thanos. It took them over 20 movies to get to their most defying antagonist and the wait was worth it. Josh Brolin's performance as Thanos truly stands out among a sea of Hollywood A-listers portraying characters that became iconic. The movie is a action packed thrill ride from the opening until the shocking ending and it keeps you on the edge of your seat during the whole run-time. A must watch and one of the cultural phenomenons of modern cinema which will be remembered and re-watched by generations to come.,

403,28 December 2018,lovettstough,10, WOW! JUST WOW!,I am totally shook and mindblown. I can't believe how good and bad this movie is all at the same time. I can't believe they let the movie end the way it did but there has to be another in the works. Thanos is totally and completely pure EVIL just like the EVIL lying crooked corrupt chump trump and his family and administration. This movie will make you cheer the good guys and break your heart all at the same time. There has got to be more in the works.,
404,26 April 2021,racoonito,10, What i wanted and what everyone wanted.,This movie is perfect. Marvel pulled this off amazingly with us being re-introduced to the characters after civil war was amazing. The writers worked on every little detail on the script and the Russo brothers put it in front of our eyes in such a perfect way. This is why Marvel are the best superhero franchise.,
405,2 May 2018,RussHog,7, Like too many marvel crossovers...,This movie is a lot of fun and it has great moments. It is a delight to see the crossover of Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers meet to battle the veiled villain of the last decade in the Marvel Universe. But IMO: Thanos is not the greatest villain in the Marvel Universe. His motivation is not that awesome - and in a way - by making the universe hang in the balance the film raised the stakes so high it was difficult to really care or believe. There is no real drama at the end because like any comic book...the character's will return. However - the fights are great fun. So - like any great crossover...it was big and loud but not as good as a single edition adventure.,
406,27 May 2020,brandonrhewitt,10, Masterpiece!!!,The reason i love this movie well there are millions of reasons but one of the reasons is that THE BAD GUY WINS like i love that its dark kinda its realistic in a way as to say that not all the time the good guys win. I just love movies that shows the bad guys win like this and revenge of the sith i need to see more movies or shows like it coz not all the time the good guys are gonna win i love it i inject that s**t,

You may nitpick and there are things to critisize as with all movies, but as a Universe Marvel did a fantastic job, setting characters up and giving us something to look for. So even the smallest things can make you chuckle (if you are like me and into that sort of stuff), like Groot and Captain America introducing themselves to each other.
