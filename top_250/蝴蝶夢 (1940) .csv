0,15 January 2017,AlsExGal,9, A film with a nameless protagonist and an invisible namesake,"This was Alfred Hitchcock's first American-made film. Quite frankly, I'm amazed at how well Hitchcock ""got"" what American audiences wanted in their suspense films, hitting them out of the park from the moment he began working in the US. ",/
1,10 July 2021,kosmasp,10, Place Holder,"Hitchcock - never won an Oscar - not in the Best Director department that is. He was nominated multiple times, but never got one. At least this movie right here won one for best movie. I know it is sometimes strange how a movie can win best movie, but the Director won't get one too.",r
2,5 March 2005,nycritic,10, What Atmospheric Gothic-horror Should Be.,"Alfred Hitchcock was and is still the undisputed Master of Suspense, and there is a lot of that here in his foray into Gothic horror, as the mystery surrounding the unseen yet omnipresent Rebecca will engage the viewer from its dreamy start to its bleak conclusion. This is exactly what atmospheric is supposed to be about, and in black and white, it shines. This is also what Gothic horror is in essence, and many have imitated yet come up short, most notably M. Night Shyamalan who, in trying to go for a shock twist and purported ""atmosphere"" only creates a bad aftertaste and a hangover the size of Mount Everest. This is, essentially, Hitchcock's first true masterpiece.",e
3,15 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10, Chilling and dramatic- a must see for Hitchcock fans!,"I am 17, and I love this movie. One definite positive of Rebecca is the masterful direction by Alfred Hitchcock, full of the usual twists and turns that make his films so pleasing. The chilling and suspenseful story, of a timid young woman marrying a man and finding herself in the shadow of his dead first wife, has many complex issues, such as the possibilities of suicide, murder and mistaken identity, all of which took me completely by surprise. Rebecca also has gorgeous black and white cinematography, and a beautifully atmospheric music score. But it's the performances from the distinguished cast that holds this film together. Laurence Olivier, one of Britain's finest stage and film actors(you only have to see him in Shakespeare to know the talent this man had), gives a towering performance as Maxim De Winter, a broken man haunted by his first wife's death. The lovely Joan Fontaine is the picture of innocence and vulnerability as the 2nd Mrs De Winter, giving a genuine sense of fright and emotion throughout. Also superb is the suave George Sanders as the rather loathsome blackmailing Favel, who smirks and makes acidic remarks as effortlessly as Clark Gable did in Gone With The wind. But stealing the acting honours is Judith Anderson as the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, a performance that is truly sinister, like the scene when she sets Manderly on fire, her facial expression looking out of the window gave me the shivers. The script was tense, dark and flawlessly delivered. Through the characters we hear that Rebecca was beautiful and possessed all the other positive virtues, so I was shocked when that wasn't to be. All in all, a chilling and dark film, that is a must see. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",v
4,3 December 2003,FiendishDramaturgy,10," All around, an excellent production.","his movie is a 10 from the very beginning.

6,5 October 2006,ma-cortes,8, Hitchcock's first great American success in a classic story with a love story and suspense,"This is a Daphne Du Maurier's story (from a best-seller novel) concerning a prominent widower (Laurence Olivier) called Maxim De Winter who finds a gorgeous and timid young girl (Joan Fontaine) who is serving to an old Mistress (Florence Bates) . They are married and head to Manderley , the familiar mansion (in the exterior actually is a scale model).

7,3 January 2005,sol-,10, My brief review of the film,"A stylishly directed and photographed film that examines a number of themes, such a deception, death and depression, and explores well the emotions of its characters. It is rare to find a film like this, as it tackles various genres, ranging from being a romance to a mystery to a drama to even a comedy at times, and all without seeming pretentious. The cast is truly magnificent. Judith Anderson is a stunner is a quiet but sinister role, and George Sanders is even more impressive in lively but also sinister performance. Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine are perfect for their roles too. The film won Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Cinematography quite deservingly  this is one of the best films Hollywood has ever produced.",/

This was also the first film in which he adapted someone else's work, the famous novel by de Maurier.",w

11,5 June 2006,Quinoa1984,10," a producer/director combination that works, elegantly and to the best of abilities","David O. Selznick might have had more of an influence over this production than some might think- as with many of his films- and he is the one who ended up receiving the Oscar, not director Alfred Hitchcok, for the 1940 mystery-drama-romance Rebecca. But it is to the credit of both that, for the most part, it looks as if both tried to stay out of each other's way and just put up as good as film as they could. And it is a credit to Hitchcock that with a certain change from what one might see in his perhaps more entertaining films of the 50's and 60's also shows his knack at making great romantic Hollywood movie-making.

15,13 February 2020,BA_Harrison,8, Hitch's first hit from Hollywood.,"Director Alfred Hitchcock is renowned for his visual acuity, creating some of the most memorable shots in movie history; he also had a keen eye for beauty, casting some of Hollywood's most stunning actresses in iconic roles: Grace Kelly in Rear Window, Maureen O'Hara in Jamaica Inn, Tippi Hedren in The Birds, Ingrid Bergman in Spellbound, and Janet Leigh in Psycho, to name but a few. Perhaps his most enchanting leading lady was Joan Fontaine, who won an Oscar for her role in Suspicion (1941), but who was never more appealing than in her first film for Hitch, Rebecca, based on a novel by Daphne Du Maurier.",8
16,11 June 1999,Twillhead,10," A Classic on par with ""Citizen Kane""","In a line-up of great motion pictures, ""Rebecca"" stands as one of the giants. It is arguably Hitchcock's greatest film effort, replete with jolting, slap-in-the-face plot twists and gothic sets. Dark and moody, the film boasts Sir Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine in slam-dunk, dead on performances, George Sanders as the deliciously despicable Jack Favell, and Judith Anderson nearly stealing the show as the eerie, obsessed housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers. A perfect ""10"".",6
17,17 August 2006,bkoganbing,8, On The Road To Manderley,"I've always found it curious that of all the films Alfred Hitchcock directed Rebecca was the one that wound up with the Best Picture Oscar and that Hitchcock didn't receive Best Director for it. Usually those two go together. John Ford won his second Oscar for Best Director for The Grapes of Wrath that year instead. Also Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson were nominated and all came up short.",/
18,23 March 2018,LuuxeDelux,8, Answered Questions,"I'm not saying that this is one of my favorite Hitchcock films (it isn't), but it IS one of my favorite books. Because of the production code being in full swing in 1940, several main plot points are either much too subtle or were left out of the film altogether, and I want people who have seen ""Rebecca"" to understand some of the most important things in the story.",?
19,29 December 2006,Doylenf,8," This is a Daphne duMaurier story, not a typical Hitchcock film...","It's silly for those who complain that Hitchcock did not put his usual stamp on this film--and then they cite VERTIGO, MARNIE, SHADOW OF A DOUBT, etc., etc.--when all the time Hitchcock himself has said that this was not a typical Hitchcock film per se. He knew he had a Daphne duMaurier story to tell and he was not able to turn the whole thing into his kind of film because David O. Selznick insisted that they be as faithful as possible to the original material.",r
20,15 November 2005,JamesHitchcock,8, One of the Great Hitchcock Classics,"It is strange that after arriving in Hollywood from Britain, Alfred Hitchcock should have chosen to base his first film upon a novel by Daphne du Maurier, the same author, who had provided him with the material for the last film of his British period. ""Jamaica Inn"" was one of his few failures, a minor-league costume drama that is today of little interest except to Hitchcock completists. With ""Rebecca"", however, he achieved one of his greatest successes, even though the story is hardly typical of his work.",e
21,21 September 2001,Hitchcoc,9, I'm Glad He Made It,"I pretty much ignored this film when I first saw. Having gained a great appreciation for Hitchcock and having studied his films and read widely about his work, I have come to appreciate this more than some think I should. I bought a copy of the movie, but I forced myself to read the book again (it had been about 30 years, when, out of curiosity, I read it). It is a book full of wonderful atmosphere, a bit sappy in places, but has that Gothic appeal that I love. When I got the film out, I was ready, and found myself caught up in the wonderful story. Like Jane Eyre, there is that secret that becomes a part of the decay of Manderly. It can't become alive again until things have been resolved. With a masterful hand, Hitchcock delicately brings his camera around and around and peeks in the shadows, bringing threat from every corner of the mansion. I don't think the acting is average. Olivier is at his best, again, as in Wuthering Heights, standing above his ghosts. If there is a weakness, it's not in the film, but in the book. What are Olivier's motive sin marrying the girl if he was to resign her to the coldness of her new environment. How clueless was he about the hatred directed toward his young wife. Was he totally unaware that Rebecca could hold forth even in her death? Still, even though Sir Alfred didn't really like doing this film and probably butted heads with his producer, it is a work of incredible craftsmanship and when it is over, it makes one feel the great loss. Like ""The Fall of the House of Usher,"" the cracks in the foundation are what this story is all about. If it had been made today, it would probably have brought down the characters as well.",f

Maxim takes his new wife to his mansion, the huge Manderlay, and they are booth greeted by the staff. But this is not the first time Maxim is married. His former wife, Rebecca, drowned a year ago and her memory lies heavy over the mansion. Mrs de Winter feels totally out of place, like an intruder, and it does not help that Mrs Danvers, the head of the staff, was very fond of the first Mrs de Winter and is acting very cold towards the new wife. And Maxim, when not leaving his new wife alone, acts very strange when anyone speaks of Rebecca. His new wife feels that she has to compete with an idol and does everything she can to please her husband, but as she misinterprets a lot of signs, she fails. And one fateful night, things are discovered that puts the death of Rebecca in question. Accident? Suicide? Murder?",_
23,20 September 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10," Fantastic Hitchcock, one of his best","This is Hitchcock at his best; just when you think that you've figured everything out, you are treated to a twist that completely turns your perception of the film around. This isn't the twists of modern movies, where you're immediately awe-struck by the sheer unlikeliness of them, but rather twists that send a chill down your spine and turn the movie in a direction you wouldn't have imagined possible. There is almost more suspense and tension in the entire last *half hour* than there is in the collective amount of supposedly suspenseful films of newer time. This is thriller, as it's supposed to be. Don't give us the husband-suddenly-turned-psychotic out to kill his wife, keep the face-less killer devoid of any real motive away, and please spare us the old cliché of the psychopath who rarely ever has a reason for his/her behavior. This is what a thriller is supposed to be like. Constantly hinting at something, hidden in the past, keep us guessing what it is, and just when we think we've figured everything out, pull the carpet out from under our feet. The one complaint I could come up with for this film is that the first half doesn't accomplish much, apart from build-up and character development, but, the more I think about it, the more I realize that that's what makes the impact of the second half; we *think* we know these people, these secretive and hidden people, we think we've figured out what they're hiding, why they are so secretive, and then we hear how different the truth is from what we had expected, and it is devastating, in a good way. To use a metaphor: Just the moment you're sure you've put together the puzzle, someone points out that you've missed a fourth of it, or, rather, points out that the picture is, while it seems logical at its current state, far from the real picture. The plot is excellent, and the way it slowly unravels is perfect. It keeps you guessing and watching, patiently and attentive, and once you're treated to the mind-blowing final half hour, full of twists, tension and suspense, you will not feel that you have wasted the time up to that point; quite the opposite, actually. The film has a very good pace, and is thoroughly interesting. The acting is great; Laurence Olivier as the mystical yet charming Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as the nameless heroine who is humble and submissive, George Sanders as the sleazy, creepy Jack Favell and Judith Anderson as the cold character of Mrs. Danver, who is seemingly devoid of emotion. The characters are well-written and credible. The cinematography is defining of Hitchcock, with plenty of play on shadows and long, lingering pans that only increase the chill down your spine. The dialog is well-written and surprisingly sharp. The whole thing is just amazing as a film. Defining of Hitchcock and worth watching for any competent film viewer. One final note; the last few scenes involve so many twists, so much suspense and tension, that it puts just about every single other non-Hitchcock thriller to shame. I recommend it to any major fan of film in general, as most should find something enjoyable about it, any fan of Hitchcock, and big fans of the following genres: thriller, mystery, drama and romance. This certainly deserves its place on the Top 250(as I'm writing this, it's #105), and should be viewed by any major fan of films in general. 10/10",=
24,1 June 2000,zetes,10," The very definition of ""Haunting""","I was quite interested in the film while I was watching it, but when it ended, I didn't feel impacted. Very soon afterwards, however, my mind began to feel very heavy. The first words of the film came floating back to me: ""Last night I dreamt I went to Manderly again."" I ruminated over the events of the film, and I began to tear up a bit. It creates one of the most unsettling atmospheres ever to exist in a film. I still feel enshrouded in the mist and smoke that curled around Manderly. I can tell that this is going to be one of those films that, when I recall it to memory, I will fall back into its mood. I can't say this for too many films.",t
25,11 June 2005,blanche-2,10, one of the greats,"Rebecca is one film I could watch over and over. It is definitely one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. I recently saw the DVD version for the first time, which had the screen tests and some of Selznick's memos. My favorite was the memo that said, ""Please don't say anything to Larry and Vivien"" referring to the fact that Vivien Leigh wanted the Fontaine role so that she could be with Olivier. Though her second screen test was better than her first, in my mind, I've always pictured Leigh as the actual Rebecca, were she ever shown.",t

Van Hoffstetter is instantly replaced by the awful, iron-willed, disdaining housekeeper at her new estate, Mrs. Danvers; some sort of nightmare embodiment of all that's wrong and masochistic about British servitude.

28,6 November 2006,moonspinner55,7, A sumptuous Gothic...,"Daphne Du Maurier's novel becomes a handsome romantic-thriller from director Alfred Hitchcock involving a naïve young woman (Joan Fontaine) who weds a wealthy, mysterious man (Laurence Olivier) and moves into his imposing castle filled with memories of his deceased first wife. Despite a stiff opening reel, ""Rebecca"" is a well-mounted psychological melodrama in the ""Jane Eyre"" vein. Judith Anderson's Mrs. Danvers has been interpreted (and misinterpreted) to death--she's indeed a little grandiose--though it's still a stunning characterization: a steely-eyed villainess who ranks right up there with the most enjoyable cinema-baddies. The movie gushes and flutters over Olivier almost as much as Fontaine does; he's quite good, but this turns out to be Joan's picture. Increasingly insecure, nervous, chatty and overeager, Fontaine runs the gamut of emotions and is never less than compelling. 11 Oscar nominations with two wins: George Barnes for hsi cinematography and for Best Picture. *** from ****",r
29,8 February 2007,planktonrules,9, Exceptional but perhaps a tad overrated,"While I have always thought this movie was a bit overrated, it is still an exceptional film and those on IMDb who gave it scores of 1 or 2 are way out of line. Overrated it might be, but it STILL is a very good and interesting film.",v
30,11 September 2021,briancham1994,9, Suspenseful and dark,"In true Alfred Hitchcock style, this film is full of suspense and darkness. The initial events seem innocent enough - a wealthy gentleman sweeps an insecure young woman off her feet while on a trip to Monaco - yet things go on a gradual downtown as the events of the past catch up to them. The atmosphere is one of extreme discomfort, as the protagonist is constantly under scrutiny and compared with her predecessor, a universal obsession that she eventually succumbs to. The stark monochrome cinematography suggests that many things are hidden in the mansion, and the emotional acting adds deep characterisation to everyone on screen, all culminating in some shocking twists.",
31,25 December 2007,ackstasis,9," ""She knew everyone that mattered. Everyone loved her.""","By the end of the 1930s, working for Michael Balcon at the Gaumont-British Picture Corporation , director Alfred Hitchcock was heading towards the peak of his artistic potential. Films such as 'The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934),' 'The 39 Steps (1935)' and 'The Lady Vanishes (1938)' became both critical and commercial successes, and so it was only a matter of time before he was tempted over to Hollywood to pursue even greater fame and fortune. Though his working relationship with independent producer David O. Selznick proved constantly frustrating  Selznick often demanded a large amount of creative control over his films  their very first collaboration proved one of Hitchcock's most successful, with 'Rebecca (1940)' becoming his only film to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Based on Daphne du Maurier's 1938 novel of the same name, 'Rebecca' is a tense, atmospheric Gothic melodrama about the lingering influence of the story's unseen title character, long after her own death.",
32,3 May 2008,wes-connors,10, Alfred Hitchcock Puts Hollywood on Edge,"What else can you say about Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rebecca""? It's still a startling production. Most obviously, it's one of the most perfect ""Gothic"" dramas produced; making a very steady transformation from Daphne du Maurier novel to film, it gives the genre refreshing celluloid life. Mr. Hitchcock directs star Joan Fontaine (as Mrs. De Winter) to the top of her profession; her guilty, frightened performance is a model for the reluctant Gothic heroine. Mysterious Laurence Olivier (as Maxim De Winter) and the supporting cast are perfect; with sinister Judith Anderson (as Mrs. Danvers) raising her character to striking icon status. Ms. Anderson's excessive fondness for ""Rebecca"", and the understated perverseness of sexuality between Mr. Olivier and both Mrs. De Winters, gives the film a edginess not permitted at the time. And, it was all enhanced by Hitchcock's expressive direction of George Barnes' camera. ",

34,29 December 2010,mjneu59,10, Hitchcock goes to Hollywood,"Alfred Hitchcock's Hollywood debut, while not likely to appeal to the same fans who champion 'Vertigo' or 'Psycho', is nevertheless a 14-karat treasure from the Golden Age of movie-making. Purists will argue that the film is more Selznick than Hitchcock: a blockbuster studio production packed with talent, prestige, and all the glamour money can buy, but certain touches (mostly those concerning malevolent maidservant Judith Anderson and smarmy playboy George Sanders) could not have been duplicated by any other director. The film today, restored to all its magnificent, pristine clarity, is suitably lush and moody, and after all these years the atmosphere of unease surrounding the stately house of Manderley is still palpable. But the Daphne Du Maurier scenario is still very much an anachronism: the innocent, unsophisticated girl who marries into wealth and tries, desperately, to conform to society's manners is hardly a valid role model these days. And once the mystery of the late Rebecca de Winter is finally solved, the Gothic plot settles into a conventional blackmail scheme more typical of the Master of Suspense.",

That's how good a film it is. Daphne Du Maurier's tale of a shy companion who shocks her employer by winning the most desired wealthy widow in England is gripping, suspenseful, and filled with innuendo. Joan Fontaine never gave a more lovely performance as the awkward bride who leaves her hysterically selfish employer (Florence Bates) to marry the brooding Maxim De Winter (Laurence Olivier) and finds animosity from the darkly dressed Mrs. Danver (Judith Anderson) who resents her intrusion because of her devotion to Maxim's late wife, Rebecca. The mystery of how Rebecca died and what kind of woman she really was is explored, and with the intrusion of scoundrel George Sanders and some well-meaning advice from Maxim's toothy sister (Gladys Cooper), the new Mrs. De Winter (her first name is never revealed) finds out more than she bargained for.",

But though these memorable instances attempt to cajole us into admiration during the viewing, the overall product beckons us to reexamine our initial wooing. There are a few other moments of atmospheric success, and Fontaine's initial arrival and exploration of Manderlay and its characters is interesting, but otherwise, the film is often mediocre, and sometimes even poor. Laurence Olivier is very stale and does not exude much of a presence, nor a riveting sense of charm. Fontaine is better, but her character is completely over-the-top. She seems well adjusted and interesting at first, then does nothing but shake and stand with lost eyes for the rest of the film. I know the situation is supposed to bring about such behavior, but it is just too much. The chemistry between the two characters is horrible. Perhaps that is supposed to demonstrate the awkwardness in their relationship. But, then we find de Winter really does love her, and he hates his dead wife. So while his madness translates well, his supposed love for her never does. Not even at the end. And hers for him feels impossible to get our heads around, since he never does anything but be rich and handsome to impress her. I know, I know, those are the dynamics of the relationship, and some of them are more subtle (e.g. de Winter probably goes for her because she seems sexually tame and timidly obsequious), but it still does not feel right in the end. The characters' actions are too shortsighted for the overall plot.",

Almost everything that makes a film Hitchcock-esque seems to be missing in Rebecca. The film is full of imposing camera angles and the wonderful lighting I adore in Hitchcock pictures, but his standard care with which his narrative is formed seemed completely different.

The music is so overdone it makes you wonder what they were thinking by putting it in there so much. This movie is just waiting to be parodied (as it has been).  And then there's the ending when this turns into a movie in search of an editor. Every time you think it might be over it goes on for ten more minutes. Then, is it over?  No, it just rambles on and on until you want to strangle whoever is playing that awful music.  It should be noted that this movie has more of Selznick in it than Hitchcock.  After making this film Hitch began to try and get every other studio in Hollywood to hire him out so he wouldn't have to work with Selznick again.  He even makes fun of Selznick with smug jokes in later movies.  I can see why.  If somebody took my movie and put in that music and let it ramble on forever I'd be mad at them, too. There is a good idea for a film in here somewhere, but this isn't it.  I hope all the people who voted this the best picture of 1940 were given a nice padded cell.

I have several problems with the film, not least with the two leads but I think that for me the real problem is that this is not so much Hitchcock's film as that of the all powerful and at that time all involving Mr Selznick. Given more of a free reign, I would have expected Olivier to be replaced if he could not get himself a little more involved in the proceedings and not to have had Joan Fontaine play her role so meekly (and dowdily!). Most of the action at Mandelay is good and creepy but we seem to gain little from the early scenes, supposedly showing us the couple's love blossom. I also felt that the almost comic cops at the end took away what edge the director had managed to engender.

89,20 November 2001,blu_cu,9, WONDERFUL!!!,"Rebecca was the second consecutive Best Picture produced by David O. Selznick. Selznick did the right thing in bringing Hitchcock to direct the film and in doing so, turned it into a classic. Hitchcock is a genius and throughly deserved an Oscar. Laurence Olivier plays the rich English owner of Manderly, Maxim De Winter. Olivier gives a fine and tortured performance of a man who is haunted by his dead wife, Rebecca. His performance was great but the only flaw is that his character is annoyingly unresponsive to his wife. Judith Anderson gives a chilling performance as Mrs. Danvers, the crazed housekeeper with a lunatic obsession to her dead mistress, Rebecca. Her lines are classic and it is she who gives the tense atmosphere to the movie-Hitchcock's dark and cold Manderly just enhanced Miss Anderson's performance. It is Joan Fontaine who really gave the stellar performance as the second Mrs. De Winter. She is a shy girl who suddenly marries the haunted Maxim of a great estate. Hitchcock originially wanted Fontaine's sister, Olivia De Havilland to play the part. Olivier wanted his wife, Vivien Leigh. Although both ladies are great actresses, I'm glad that Fontaine was cast because she made Rebecca what it is today. This was the movie that sprung Fontaine to stardom and her shyness of the camera was carefully inputed into the character of the lonely Mrs. De Winter. Her first words: ""Last night I dreamt we went to Manderly again"" sets context not only to the story but to the character of Mrs. De Winter. She is shy, unused to a formal life, desperate for Maxim's love and most of all, intimidated by the presence of the late Rebecca in Manderly. Mrs. De Winter was supposed to be a plain and mousy person and so, Fontaine had the misfortune of being a beautiful woman playing an unattractive one. However, Fontaine presents other ways of being unattractive--such as that Mrs. De Winter has absolutely no social skills. All in all, Fontaine gave a performance that deserved a Best Actress Oscar. Although she lost out to Ginger Rogers, the Academy gave a compensation Oscar the following year for her less impressive ""Suspicion"".",

She stops him and they met up again later that day. They spend lots of time with each other and soon marry, despite the fact that Ms. Fontaine is unprepared for her new role as Olivier's wife. Trouble only continues when Ms. Fontaine arrives at the large estate and finds that everyone, especially the head maid Miss.

99,1 November 2020,Cineanalyst,9," A Haunted House, Incest, Lesbians and Rosebud","The central romance and mystery may be the least interesting thing about ""Rebecca,"" but even that has its psychosexual perversity. It's a typical Hollywood coupling of an older man, Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier)--in this case a widower--with a younger and inexperienced woman (Joan Fontaine). She's presumably a virgin before they meet, but, more than that, for most of the picture, she's entirely submissive and unsure of herself. She has so little identity beyond constantly being afraid and her devotion to her husband that she's never even given a name until she's married, becoming the second Mrs. De Winter. Orphaned, she leaves the employ of one mother figure to marry a stand-in for her other deceased parent. This is precisely what Maxim adores about her, too, as he orders her to never be 36 years old and laments what a pity it is that she has to ""grow up."" The Oscar-nominated Fontaine nails ""that funny young lost look,"" too, that her fatherly husband wishes to preserve. The great mystery of this Gothic romance turns out to be that Maxim didn't love his first wife precisely because the gendered roles were reversed--him inexperienced and Rebecca unsubmissive and sexually promiscuous. It's the old chestnut of punishing women for sexual infidelity, which, as it involves her cousin (George Sanders), also takes on an incestuous quality this time--and not of the sort condoned in the father-and-child dynamic of the second marriage--to go along with a hint of gay panic and queer bashing over the subtextual lesbianism between Rebecca and Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) and the threat thereof between Mrs. Danvers and the second Mrs. De Winter.",

Her beauty, wits and most importantly how she had managed to admire so many people all at once while maintaining her solemnity with everyone except her husband.

104,31 December 2005,Igenlode Wordsmith,8," It's clever, but is it Art?","The tragedy of this film -- at least to anyone who knows the book, which is naturally a self-selecting and biased group -- is that the pacing is terribly uneven. It's almost as if the studio suddenly noticed that the picture was going to run twenty minutes over its allocated slot, and ordered the final scenes to be cut to the bone and run together at breakneck speed. The result, for me, is a curiously unsatisfying finale; why go to the trouble of altering the original plot to ensure that Maxim's wife is in the house when it is set on fire, for example, and then cut the sequence so quickly that there is no real element of suspense whatsoever? It's a tragedy precisely because the film was potentially so good. I've seen stage adaptations of the same story, and they totally failed to catch the book's mingled atmosphere of sunlit happiness and suspense -- the taint of Rebecca reaching up from the past to destroy the innocence of the present. Right up until the moment when the heroine descends the staircase, however, this version is almost flawless; the comedy, the romance, the crippling social humiliations, the country-house interiors, the monstrous Mrs van Hopper, kind and tactless Beatrice, insinuating Jack Favell, aloof Maxim... and, of course, Joan Fontaine, who might have been made for the part. I had no mental image at all of what the book's heroine looked like -- but the moment I saw Miss Fontaine I knew she was absolutely right. Arguably she is too beautiful, almost distractingly so at times; but her style, her body language, the schoolgirl simplicity of her face, are all exactly fitting to the mood of Daphne du Maurier's unnamed narrator.",

Selznick. That honestly feels like a step in the right direction. Instead of having an egomaniac try to dictate Hitchcock's own movie to him on set, he only had the egomaniac on the phone and in the editing booth. Reading about Hitchcock up to this point in the timeline of his filmography, this is the first time I've seen his editing in the camera technique mentioned where he only shot exactly what he needed to edit together. So, he didn't have entire scenes playing out across multiple takes, instead he shot what he needed from a particular actor in an exchange at a particular angle and stopped filming. I have to imagine that this was a technique that he developed while working in the studio system in Britain where he had to be as economical as possible. It had the added advantage of preventing Selznick from completely remaking the film in the editing bay. So, despite the stories of how much Selznick wanted to mess with the film, Hitchcock made the film in a way that only minimal messing could happen.",

Anyway Selznick was honored in 1939 by a ton of Oscars including Best Picture of the Year. Not satisfied with thus honoring Mr. Selznick, Hollywood bestowed another Best Picture Oscar on him in 1940 for ""Rebecca."" The difference being that GWTW is/was truly a great film, while ""Rebecca"" was boring enough to put a hyper-active into a coma of ZZZ's.

116,11 May 2020,zeekwunlau,8, A little thought,"Mr. Maxim was very suspicious as soon as he appeared. He invited the hostess to travel, but his expression was so impatient and anxious. It seemed that he was not enjoying but what forced him to do these things. His posture was high, and the hostess was in him. The words are ""girls"", ""kids"", and the miserable life of the hostess, his angry temper at any time, I suspect that this is a blue beard-like character, the hostess's cautious flinch, but also her self-positioning ratio Since the hostess is more like a pet, she has to please the gentleman in order to qualify as the owner of this manor. When Maxim spoke of rebecca 's accident, he hated her instead of rebecca, the heroine 's eyes were the brightest in the show, it was a real joy, and it was different from the pleading with a pitiful smile. It was only after that that the heroine changed her direction of courageous growth. That was the source of her courage, whether she was accidentally killed or murdered. In the novel, it was murdered in the movie, but for the heroine, both murder and accident could only be Accidentally, a murderer is better than a husband who never forgets his ex-wife. Maxim was injured here in rebecca, so he subconsciously found the hostess who is completely opposite to r. The biggest advantage of the hostess is that she is different from the discordant upper class. Her clumsyness is her flash. It 's a pity. Yes, the hostess is a very adaptable person. I think about Stockholm, why there are more women with such a psychological state. In primitive tribes, women are used as reproductive resources. When this tribe loses, they only become the mothers of another tribe. In addition to being a loser, the male will die. The Lord had no choice about getting married. He was proposed by a wealthy husband and continued to live with the wife who made trouble. She chose the former so she naturally fell in love with the gentleman. Like behind a window in ""Back Window"", the sweet newlyweds live upstairs with their husbands who killed their wives and separated their corpses. They are in different periods of love, and the hostess will never be incompatible with the upper class. No one cares about her. Name, she will have a name and life like ""rebecca"" one day.",

Basically, a young wife joins her husband in his ancient family mansion, only to be haunted by his past wife's influence. This is, in my opinion, one of Hitchcock's best. The acting is fantastic across the board; from the two main leads, to Mrs. Danvers (who became a huge influence in many other films) to the old beach hermit. The love between the second Mrs. De Winter and Maxim is believable. It makes you root for them the whole movie, which makes the stakes feel higher, and the tension tenser. The set pieces (especially the mansion) are grand and dark and brooding. There are some special effects and backdrops that are relics of the age, but they don't distract from the movie too much. The pacing is also a little slow at times; it felt like there were long stretches were every minute I was fully engaged, but then there would be a scene or sequence that seemed to drag on forever.

It was the first among the string of hits he directed during 40's and 50's. And moreover this is is so different from his other movies which generally revolve around some guy trying to clear his name and someone discussing a perfect murder. I cannot understand why academy didn't award Hitchcock an Oscar for this(though the movie got one) This is the story of a young simple woman played by Joan Fontaine who falls in love and marries a widower Maxim De Winter who is the lord of Manderly . She finds herself in a awkward position of the employer in their mansion with a fleet of servants to her disposal . But she finds that everyone is still in awe with with maxim's ex-wife Rebecca and no matter what she does she cannot fill her shoes. Maxim played by Laurence Olivier is a loving husband who loses his mind easily and bursts into violent anger sometimes. He is quite convincing as a man trying to forget his dead wife and trying to move on.

Thanks to the larger budget he got across the pond from David O. Selznick, he could build magnificent sets crammed with detail.

Having considered both Hitchcock and Olivier vastly overrated almost all my life I had no problem avoiding this one when it occasionally surfaced on television but recently it was given away with a newspaper and so eventually I stuck it in the DVD and tried to give it a fighting chance to justify the hype surrounding it. I've seen about 90-95% of Larry Olivier's films and found them mostly ho hum but here he hits a new low worthy of Emil Jannings or Charles Laughton at their worst. Displaying neither charisma nor charm he is nevertheless able to sweep an ultra naive Joan Fontaine off her feet and repair with her to his Gothic manse where the memory of his first wife, Rebecca, is all-pervasive not least with the Gale Sondergaard-lite housekeeper Mrs Danvers (Judith Anderson). About half the 'English Colony' - UK actors domiciled in Hollywood - pop up in an attempt at 'local color' so trivia buffs can have a field day looking out for C.

Mrs. Danvers is scarier than any vampire, she appears and disappears almost like a ghost, so ominous it's clear something must be terribly wrong with this household. One almost expects her to announce, ""This is Hell and I am the Devil."" For the young woman that moves into this house (Joan Fontaine), she sure is. A new wife of the owner, Max de Winter, she feels small and insignificant, constantly unfavorably compared to Rebecca, the deceased first wife, by Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper. We see her roaming about the gigantic house, lost and confused. She doesn't even have a name and Rebecca does, still the lady of the manor, as ever. We never see a picture of Rebecca though, and our mind, just like the young Mrs. de Winter's, can't stop trying to imagine the greatest beauty to ever grace the earth. She was prettier than Joan Fontaine! Her husband Max, played by Laurence Olivier, doesn't help her much with his constant put-downs. Olivier was perhaps a better film actor than he had thought of himself. The film shifts from romcom, to psychological, to very real horror. Cynics would say, the natural stages of any marriage. But in the masterful hands of Alfred Hitchcock, it's art. The Selznick production - impeccable, as always. Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers will forever give me nightmares.

And - the best of all - this is a movie with Mrs. Danvers (magnificent Judith Anderson). Now I can finally admit that I always found her the true owner of Manderley and if anybody asked me, I would drown both Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier, in my version Mrs. Danvers would live on and on forever, bringing fresh flowers in Rebecca's bedroom and occasionally even try those silk stockings and underwear made by nuns from convent.

132,28 August 2008,JohnHowardReid,10, Last Night I Dreamt I Went to Manderley Again!,"If 1939 was Hollywood's greatest year, 1940 certainly followed it mighty close. And of all 1940's marvelous movies, Rebecca is one of the most enduringly entertaining. In fact, it has not dated in the slightest and is still one of the most suspensefully intriguing, rivetingly fascinating of all Hollywood's essays into the realm of the romantic Gothic thriller. Among many reasons for this success, I offer the following thoughts at random: (1) Daphne du Maurier is one of the most talented and articulate writers in this field and her novel has been expertly adapted; (2) despite his disclaimers, Rebecca is the sort of movie at which Hitchcock excels. It has a brooding atmosphere of mystery and horror that Hitchcock is able to play up to such an extent that it becomes more important than the plot. This is a major triumph because when boiled down, the plot is actually rather familiar, even (dare we say it?) trite. Hitchcock's creation of this richly pervading atmosphere which leads to such a complete suspension of our minds, is achieved by his masterly control of pacing, acting, composition; and his ability to influence photographer, composer and set designers to produce the right effects. Notice, for example, that Manderley is really a castle of the mind. It is too shadowy, too remote, too unreal because it is in the mind. It exists now only in the heroine's mind. ""Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again."" As these words are visualized on the screen, we don't see a real Manderley, but a Manderley of the mind, a nightmare, a ghost. This is Hitchcock at his most accomplished. Never mind Foreign Correspondent with all its showy bags of directorial tricks. There are just as many brilliant displays of legerdemain in Rebecca, but they are thrice as effective because they are so imperceptible, so subtle; (3) Rebecca is blessed with a most gifted cast. Joan Fontaine is exactly right and never gave a finer performance. It is really a most difficult role. The heroine in these Gothic romances is frequently some colorlessly bland little mouse of incredibly limited experience. Joan takes this stereotype and works on it with such persuasion that she brings the character not only to a vivid life, but to an astounding pitch of audience sympathy and identification. Olivier also delivers an admirably judged performance, giving de Winter effective shades of moodiness. The rest of the players are equally adept, though all are rightly overshadowed by Judith Anderson, whose coldly intense housekeeper is easily her most memorable and haunting role.",

But soon, the darker note are pressing in, and the viewer is tangled into the twisted mystery world of Manderlay.

147,30 June 2005,jboothmillard,9, Rebecca,"Most people would think that Psycho would be the most financially successful at the cinema from director Sir Alfred Hitchcock (Suspicion, Rear Window, Vertigo, The Birds), but actually it was this one, based on the book by Daphne Du Maurier. Basically, on vacation in Monte Carlo, a self-conscious inexperienced young woman (Oscar nominated Joan Fontaine) meets aristocratic widower George Fortescue Maximilian ""Maxim"" de Winter (Oscar nominated Lord Sir Laurence Olivier). She works as a lady's companion to Mrs. Van Hopper (Florence Bates), and the two spend a good deal of time together, leading to love and marriage. Maxim takes his new bride back to Manderley, his grand mansion by the sea in south-western England. The housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Oscar nominated Judith Anderson), is domineering and cold, and is obsessed with the memory of the first Mrs. De Winter, the eponymous Rebecca. Mrs. Danvers has preserved Rebecca's former grand bedroom and continues to display various items that carry her monogram (the letter ""R""). The new Mrs. De Winter is overwhelmed and intimidated by the huge house and her newfound responsibilities. But more than anything the spiritual presence of Rebecca causes Mrs. De Winter to believe that Maxim is still in love with his first wife, which could explain his occasional outbursts of anger. It is only later, talking to others, Mrs. De Winter discovers what happened to Rebecca; she died out at sea after her vessel capsized, and her body was washed ashore a few months later. There is also the appearance of Rebecca's sleazy cousin Jack Favell (George Sanders) when Maxim is away. Wanting to please her husband, Mrs. De Winter suggests holding a costume party as he and Rebecca used to. Mrs. Danvers advises her to copy the dress worn by a young woman in one of the portraits displayed on the staircase, which she implies is one of Maxim's ancestors. But, when Mrs. De Winter comes down the staircase wearing the costume, Maxim is appalled as Rebecca wore an identical dress at her last ball, just before her death. He angrily orders her to remove the dress, and she runs upstairs in tears. Mrs. De Winter confronts Danvers about this, but Danvers tells her she can never take Rebecca's place. Feeling helpless and disturbed, Mrs. Danvers almost persuades her to jump to her death from the second story window in Rebecca's room. At that moment, however, the alarm is raised because a sunken boat has been discovered. Rebecca's body has been identified aboard the boat, and suspicions start to circulate, as Maxim identified her body previously. Maxim now confesses to his new wife that he misidentified another body as Rebecca's in order to conceal the truth. He hated Rebecca and the marriage had been a sham from the start. Rebecca told Maxim she intended to continue the promiscuous and perverse life she had led before they were married but pretended to be the perfect wife and hostess for the sake of appearances. Rebecca had an ongoing affair with her cousin Jack Favell, and one night she told Maxim that she was pregnant with Favell's child. During a heated argument, she fell, struck her head, and died. To conceal the truth, Maxim took the body out in a boat, which he then scuttled and identified another body as Rebecca's. The crisis causes the second Mrs. De Winter to shed her naïve ways as they both plan how to prove Maxim's innocence. Favell attempts to blackmail Maxim by threatening to reveal that she had never been suicidal, which is suggested by the police. When Maxim goes to the police, they suspect him of murder. However, further investigation reveals that Rebecca was not pregnant but terminally ill with an incurable cancer, and may have had only weeks to live, so the suicide verdict stands. Maxim realises that Rebecca had been trying to goad him into killing her via indirect suicide so that Maxim would be ruined. Maxim is freed and returns home. But returning to Manderley, the mansion is on fire, set ablaze by the deranged Mrs. Danvers. Mrs. De Winter and all the staff escape the fire, except Danvers, who dies when the ceiling collapses on her. Also starring Nigel Bruce as Major Giles Lacy, Reginald Denny as Frank Crawley, C. Aubrey Smith as Colonel Julyan, Gladys Cooper as Beatrice Lacy, Leo G. Carroll as Dr. Baker, and Hitchcock's cameo is as a man with his back turned to the audience walking past Sanders talking to a police officer after a phone call. Fontaine is highly convincing as the constantly nervous as the working-class woman thrown fast into marriage and the high life, Olivier does very well as the husband haunted by his past, and Anderson is highly memorable as the evil housekeeper with a sinister obsession (there is a possible lesbian subtext) with the dead wife of the title. It is a film of two halves, the first about the new wife trying and failing to fit in, and the second the truth about the first wife's death being exposed, it has terrific camerawork and a splendid score that adds to the eerie atmosphere, and it is engaging, an interesting classic romantic psychological thriller. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, and Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Special Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Franz Waxman, and Best Writing, Screenplay. Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Laurence Olivier was number 21 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 3 on Britain's Finest Actors, he was number 14 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 4 on The World's Greatest Actor, Mrs. Danvers was number 31 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 80 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 73 on The Ultimate Film.

So begins the Daphne de Maurier novel and so begins this film wonderfully adapted from it by Phillip MacDonald and brought to life by Director Alfred Hitchcock of the strange days of the life of the second Mrs. de Winter. Despite what it says here on IMDb about Hitchcock winning an Oscar for Best Director for this film he did not. John Ford won for Grapes of Wrath. Hitchcock was nominated five times including for Rebecca but amazingly he never won a Best Director.This did win the Best Picture for 1940 which of course is the big award to win but it was otherwise shutout from it's 11 nominations. This is a fine film with a great cast of Joan Fontaine as the 2nd Mrs. de Winter along with leading man Laurence Olivier as her husband and Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers. The film's title character Rebecca, the first Mrs. de Winters never appears in the movie except in a portrait. George Sanders, Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny and Leo G. Carroll round out the fine cast. David O. Selznick showed with this film a preview of what great films would come from his studio in the 1940's following his monster hit the year before of Gone With The Wind and Hitchcock with this gave all a preview of what was to come from him. This is a beautifully done film and like the novel is now a classic. It's not as suspenseful as other Hitchcock films to come. It's sweeping landscapes and large interiors has the signature look of a Selznik produced film. I've seen this film several times and would rate it a 9.5 on a scale of 10 and highly recommend it.",

Regarding the acting, Joan Fontiane is absolutely believable as the young woman trying to discover and live up to the legend of Rebecca. Olivier has to convey a very complicated set of  emotions, often conflicting, and he succeeds in doing so. All the character actors whom I recognize (eg. Nigel Bruce) from other films are picture perfect in Rebecca as well. To me however the actor who leaves the most indelible impression is the actress who plays Ms. Danvers. She really comes across as loyal to her former mistress and tormenting towards the new lady of the house. I should also mention that all other aspects of the production are more than competent, especially the haunting voiceover at the start of the film. All in all, great classic picture, 8/10.",

The story centers around an wealthy English man who is suicidal and gloomy after the death of his wife.  This role is carried out brilliantly by Laurence Olivier.  He meets and falls in love with a young and very naive girl he meets in Monte Carlo. He marries her and brings her back to his boyhood home, called Manderley. This is when the trouble begins. The wife, played wonderfully by Joan Fontaine, is ill at ease as a mistress of the house and is intimidated and frightened at the idea of the first wife, Rebecca, haunting the house and the idea that she does not measure up to Rebecca, who was charming and beautiful to all who knew her. Rebecca allegedly died in a sailing accident, and when the wreck of her boat is found near the estate, all the past rises up again to destroy Maxim and his bride. Films like these are no longer made, which is why they are called classic. If you enjoy suspense, romance, or even Alfred Hitchcock films (Heaven knows I can't be the only Hitchcock fan around!), rent this film. It is rarely shown on cable, so don't look for it on TV.

184,9 November 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," Happy wife, happy life.","Essentially, 'Rebecca (1940)' feels like three different films welded together; each of its acts are somewhat distinct in tone and, even, style. To begin with, the picture focuses on a whirlwind romance between the nameless protagonist and a rich recluse who's haunted by the enigmatic existence of his eponymous ex-wife. It feels sort of like a romantic comedy here, with only a few hints of darkness seeping into the fray, and its aesthetics are rather light and, for want of a better term, fluffy. It also culminates in one of the worst marriage proposals ever, a declaration of love disguised as an insult. The second act is by far the feature's most successful, focusing on the protagonist's attempts to acclimatise to the vast halls and large staff found in her new home, all while feeling pressured to live a certain responsibility-ridden, rich-blooded lifestyle as the 'lady of the house'. It's a lonely, mysterious and somewhat gothic fish-out-of-water segment that does a fantastic job of putting you in the new Mrs. de Winter's position. It's also the part in which the haunting, almost otherworldly presence of the deceased yet incomparable Rebecca is most keenly felt. The icy air that hangs over the house and its inhabitants belies the fact that this is, in essence, a ghost story, which gives the piece an interesting texture and lends it an air of suspenseful unpredictability. The movie's final third takes place after what you initially presume to be its big, reveal-ridden finale. It turns into a sort of courtroom drama/ police procedural and is much more focused on delivering information, albeit in an intriguing and well-conceived way. It lacks the almost ethereal vibe that the second act is soaked in, feeling much more in-the-moment and, in a way, straightforward. Of course, this segment isn't bad. It just feels as though it could have been refined somewhat and arguably isn't all that necessary in the grand scheme of things. Still, the conclusion is satisfying. Overall, the film is a beguiling and often enigmatic experience that keeps you engaged throughout. 7/10",

There really isn't much meat to this part of the story. It's a bit of a rich meets poor love story, as the young bride finds herself in a romance with this man who was quite above her socially, and it's even got a bit of humour to it, as we watch the young woman's employer Mrs. Van Hopper (Florence Bates) try to ingratiate herself with Maxim. It's a pleasant enough (although not exactly engrossing) love story for a while, and after their return to Maxim's Manderlay estate it still seems to be little more than the challenge of the new Mrs. de Winter (whom I don't remember being named) to overcome the reluctance of the servants - and especially Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) - to accept her, since they appear to have been fiercely devoted to the late Mrs. de Winter (whose name was Rebecca.) Yes, Mrs. Danvers is an unusual, and therefore suspicious, character who has more than a bit of mystery about her, but still this really doesn't seem to be going anywhere very fast.",

Not horror at all, although that Mrs. Danvers could certainly pass for Bela Lugosi's sister. And it didn't feel all that Gothic to me either. But it certainly is a wonderful drama/mystery that pulled me in and held me right through to the end. I found myself staring at Joan Fontaine's face in almost every scene.

192,6 November 2013,pixrox1,9," A virtual sequel to GONE WITH THE WIND, only without the racism . . .",". . . it is no coincidence that the movie REBECCA comes from the fiendish mastermind behind WIND, producer David O. Selznick. After studying his memos to director Alfred Hitchcock for hours, several things become clear. First, Selznick treated Hitchcock as a total idiot, and bullied him to such an extent that any Miami Dolphins offensive lineman would have quit the team if faced with even half the amount of abuse. Second, Selznick decided that the magic formula for making Americans empty their wallets at the cinema box office was to select a period piece from a female novelist at the top of the best seller list and spare no expense on costumes to put a word-for-word Readers' Digest length ""picturization"" on screen. Fortunately for REBECCA, the censors forced Selznick to accept a change of the key plot point from the book regarding Rebecca's death, which improves the story's believability by at least 400%. An equally important break for this picture is that Hitchcock's one-camera, one-take shooting style prevented Selznick for totally destroying Hitchcock's work in post. (Perhaps the best proof of the virtual meaninglessness of Hollywood's Good Ol' Boy Oscar voting system is that Selznick--NOT Hitchcock--got an Oscar for REBECCA; the best picture awards for THE ARTIST & ARGO prove that, if anything, the system has devolved to an even lower nadir today). Finally, the reason WIND merits just 3 of 10 compared to REBECCA's score of 9 is that the latter is 1 hour, 45 minutes shorter, and is NOT a racist misogynistic marathon melodrama.",

Nevertheless she is talked up as the absolute paragon of womanhood and femininity; mature, sophisticated, the most beautiful creature you could ever lay your eyes on. Joan Fontaine plays the opposite quite well - the naive, tittering little girl who could never compare to the first Mrs de Winter (at least in the eyes of Mrs Danvers), and yet Maxim seems to fall for him anyway. In a funny way, the twist does make sense; most of the resentment is from Mrs Danvers herself, eyeing needles her way as she dons what Rebecca made stunning and keeps her former bedroom in pristine condition, like an obsessive shrine.

Worse still, Hitchcock found himself strangled by producer David O. Selznick, who was legendary for control-freak attitude.

The characters didn't reflect the writers picture of what they should have looked like and the acting was way over dramatized. It seems in many cases Hollywood ruins movies for the readers of the original books points of view. Was the acting good in this movie? Yes Was the directing good? Sort of... Was the casting correct and true to the story? NO I never understood why this movie was so popular... probably because most of it's viewers hadn't ever read the book before and since Hollywood loves to change things to make them ""better"" people didn't notice. If you want to see an amazingly accurate version of this wonderful book, watch the version from 1997 by Masterpiece Theatre staring Charles Dance as Maxim and Emilia Fox as Mrs. de Winter. The casting was PERFECT as was the acting. All the characters fit especially Mrs. de Winter who is supposed to be a little quiet mousy thing of a girl, very naive, who isn't all about glamor like the Mrs. de Winter depicted in the original film, who looked more like Rebecca than the character she was cast to play.",

Among them is the direction of Alfred Hitchcock, who cemented his already renowned talents developed in UK and delivered them to Hollywood (although almost the entire cast is British). The basic plot, however, is whether or not Laurence Olivier is good or evil. As evidenced by the great skills of the director, we will not discover the answer to this question until the very end of the film. Supposedly, the film had two alternative endings to match the good or evil side of Sir Laurence. I will not reveal which ending was actually used. You will be able to see it for yourself.

I won't waste space repeating all of the praise that's already been expressed by so many reviewers about the wonderful acting, directing, musical score, etc. I would like to comment, however, on the performance of one actress who never seems to get much credit. It's Florence Bates, who plays the rather short but important part of Mrs. Van Hopper at the beginning of the film. I don't think her performance as the rich, rude, self-centered American traveler abroad could possibly have been more perfect. She interrupts and rudely scolds her paid companion (Joan Fontaine), she pushes herself on Max DeWinter in efforts to scrape an acquaintance with him because of his wealth, she's totally repulsive and she speaks English in the uppity- rich Boston/Philadephia manner. She is rude and insulting at all times.",
203,10 December 2005,hmpulham,9, A lesbian subtext.,"We know that Mrs. Danvers was in love with Rebecca, the question is was Rebecca involved sexually with Mrs. Danvers? Hitchcock made pointed references to the fact the Rebecca was often a cold and sexually unresponsive wife . There is the assumption that Rebecca was at least bi-sexual. To really appreciate the subtlety of this film it helps to factor in this possible relationship between the women. Hitchcock working under the censorship code of the time could only hint at it. However, with this in mind, one doesn't have to look hard to connect",
204,3 January 2021,loloandpete,10, In a word: Perfection.,"One of the greatest page to stage adaptations and darn near faultless in every respect, it won a brace of hugely well deserved oscars in best picture and cinematography. The former obviously has a lot to do with the style and wit of the great Alfred Hitchcock, but also with it's producer, David O Selznick, who insisted on a faithful treatment of Daphne Du Maurier's novel. Hitchcock was often rather unfaithful to Source material and taking Du Maurier as an example this was sometimes a good thing (The Birds) and sometimes, a bad (Jamaica Inn). As to the cinematography, DOP George Barnes does a masterly job with moonlit images of the gothic Manderley and the rain reflected on the walls so they appear to be weeping, amongst many incredibly striking images. These are underscored and augmented hugely by Franz Waxman who provides an incredible music score and then there is the casting. Joan Fontaine from her opening voice over of the novel's first line, gives us a character who breaks our hearts and we empathise with her in every moment as a loveable, endearing and naive young women at the start to the strong, indomitable heroine at the end-what a journey and a masterclass of acting. Laurence Olivier is an aristocratic, brooding Maxim De Winter that partners Fontaine perfectly and the rest of the cast bats all the way down. Judith Anderson is one of the coldest and most intimidating characters on screen as Mrs Danvers and no one does a cad better than George Sanders as the oily but charismatic Jack Favell. Gladys Cooper and Nigel Bruce as the Laceys have brilliant chemistry together and bring immense warmth and humour to the film and Florence Bates is unforgettable as the dragon lady, Mrs Van Hopper, monstrous and hilarious. For my money this first American film of Hitchcock's is his greatest and indeed one of the very finest films ever made. In a word, perfection. Amongst it's thirteen academy award nominations that didn't win were Hitchcock, Waxman, Fontaine (who went on to win for Hitchcock's Suspicion, the following year), Olivier and Anderson. All would have been worthy winners.",

'Rebecca' combines a compelling story with excellent acting, masterful direction and haunting cinematography. The flow of the film, as it moves from almost light comedy (Florence Bates' over-the-top society-snob character) to romance to mystery to Gothic horror is a testimony to Hitchcock's skill as a director as well as the quality of the script and the talent of the cast. The climatic destruction of Mandalay and the immolation of Mrs. Danvers as she stands by her 'shrine' to Rebecca is one of Hollywood's most memorable scenes. I think that this is one of the finest films to come out of the 1940s as well as one of my personal favourites.",

Quite different from his other films, Rebecca contains no violent blood scare scene at all. But what makes Alfred Hitchcock talent is we can feel the tension atmosphere all through the film (the housekeeper's eyes to the girl, the weird west room, the sign tune of Hitchcock....). Joan Fontaine does a great help to the film as the The Second Mrs. de Winter. We have to mention without Judith Anderson (Mrs. Danvers),we can hardly imagine how it will to be. The film is really perfect until The Second Mrs. de Winter know all about Rebecca in the cottage. The after portion doesn't fully close to the beat of the film(Maybe director must make it a 2-hour-film to satisfy the company)",

209,13 March 2016,steven_torrey,10, A great HORRIBLE movie or a HORRIBLE great movie!,"The very nature of this kind of suspense drama is to lead the audience on, oftentimes with misdirection, or heightened atmospherics (an unblinking Mrs. Danvers). Of all Hitchcock movies I have seen, this one seemed to actively present Director Hitchcock as 'Deus ex machina'. The whole film seemed so contrived and fake; a story should develop 'suis generis' while this one seemed to develop by directorial disposition. In the end, to my way of thinking, it just seemed klunky. And unbelievable. For Hitchcock, the audience has to be conned into believing the events are plausible, the story line is plausible; and for many Hitchcock films, that can be a stretch. For me the worst moment came when Rebecca (Joan Fontaine) dresses as the first Rebecca for a masquerade ball at the suggestion of Mrs. Danvers. Rebecca ended up then, at that point, looking like an idiot; she always seemed not especially bright as a character--and that single decision made her seem downright stupid. Further, an inquest--long after the death of a person--was one more instance of directorial interpolation. And Rebecca, upon hearing that she is, in reality, manipulated into being the 2nd Mrs. Rebecca de Winters, would have acted appropriately in demanding answers from her new spouse; instead, she turns to Mrs. Danvers, who is intended to look and be something of psycho-zombie for confirmation of details. Again, turning to the demonic Mrs. Danvers makes Rebecca (Joan Fontaine) look borderline idiotic, especially given that Rebecca is portrayed in the film as being terrified of this psycho-zombie.",

The actors were amazing (I can't stop praising them) Laurence really nailing the role as the torn lover between his guilt and love for his 2nd wife. Joan Fontaine shines as the 2nd wife, creating what appears an exciting, genuine chemistry with Laurence whilst retaining what appears like a natural sort of innocence, that makes her a joy to watch. If only their were more actresses like her today!!! The supporting cast is well presented too. With Mrs Danvers giving me the chills every time she came on screen. Poor Joan I felt so sorry for her!

If there's any doubt of that, watch the scene of Olivier's Max recounting what happened to Rebecca. On page, it's nothing more than a well-written monologue; in Hitchcock's hands, it's a chilling piece of melodrama - a ghost story nearly-come-to-life.

The way the plot develops in this film is absolutely brilliant! Movies today are so class-less compared to this. What a performance by the actors of this film. Joan Fontaine's portrayal of Mrs DeWinter is completely convincing and I spent much of the movie really feeling for her. In the scene when she finally stands up to Mrs Danvers (""I am Mrs DeWinter now!""), you just want to cheer out loud for her! After seeing this, I really want to see more movies staring Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier to see what else they were capable of. The cast of this film are true artists who understood and got into their character, rather than making the character like their real personality, like so many actors do today. Sometimes I think it would be great if this movie were remade for today's audience, but it could never be done as well as this.

The beginning seems an excellent romantic comedy, what is not usual in Hitchcock's filmography (although it may also be seen in great Lady Vanishes). Gorgeous Joan Fontaine is extremely charming in the role of the clumsy and insecure woman whose name is never mentioned, and she has a good chemistry with Lawrence Olivier as the leading couple. The story has well developed and interesting characters, such as her Mrs. De Winter, his Maxim, and others among whom I may highlight flamboyant Mrs. Van Hopper and creepy Mrs. Danvers. However, an unique element is the strong presence of another character who is indeed absent: the Rebecca from the title, previous Mrs. De Winter. Probably, this is the most striking presence of a character who is only mentioned in the whole history of cinema. After the aforementioned romantic comedy beginning set in Monte Carlo, the movie continues engaging but with a dramatic genre twist, moving to a strong drama and psychological thriller, set in the gargantuan mansion Manderley, in Cornwall.

I have never really lost that feeling in all of the viewings since and unfortunately I have never satisfactorily figured out why it doesn't seem right. It isn't the setting or the fact that the film was made in black and white or the actors and actresses who were involved in its making, however, the actress who plays Mrs Danvers was superb and well worth watching just to see her performance and I have not read the book therefore I am not aware if it is a fair representation. Whatever it is that is not right about the film is all the way through. I know that a lot of people really like this film and when I come across someone who does like it and why I will hopefully find out why I don't.

219,16 August 2017,weezeralfalfa,7," Very slow to engage one's interest, until the last part","For me, this romantic drama didn't get very interesting until the last 40min. of a 2hr.,10min. film. However, I can say the same thing about ""Casablanca"", for example. This section begins with the startling revelation by Maxim de Winter(Laurence Olivier), that he detested, rather than cherished, his deceased wife: Rebecca. His young replacement wife('no name')(Joan Fontaine) had been in aw of Rebecca, as everyone praised her whit, energy, and skill as the mistress of an English manor. It's very odd that Maxim was so late telling his new wife that he hated his former wife, for several reasons. He said she was incapable of real love. She continued with her promiscuous lifestyle after they were married, although she managed to mostly hide this. She taunted him with details of her affairs and the suggestion that she was pregnant by another man. 'No name' was elated that Maxim, apparently in contrast to everyone else she had met at Manderley, despised his former wife, giving her an opening to outshine Rebecca, at least in Maxim's mind.(Incidentally, it's Manderley, not Mandalay, as a few reviewers wrote. Mandalay is a city in Myanmar(Burma)). Even a year after her death, there were still many physical reminders of Rebecca in the manor, often labeled with 'R'. Her room remained as it was when she died. Probably, this was more the policy of the head servant: Mrs. Danvers((Judith Anderson) than of Maxim. She had an extraordinary fondness for Rebecca, and often reminded 'no name' of her inferiority. At one point, Mrs. Danvers asks 'no name' why she doesn't leave, since Maxim doesn't love her. She opens the window, and suggests 'no name' may want to jump out. It's curious why 'no name' didn't fire her at this point?! It demonstrates how much Mrs. Danvers hated either 'no name' or Maxim or both. Also, during the burning of Manderley, Mrs. Danvers told 'no name' that she started the fire because she couldn't stand to see them as a happy couple in Manderley. Again, it's unclear whether her anger is directed at just one of them or both. Clearly, Rebecca hated Maxim, as he hated her, and tried to goad him into killing her, when she wanted to die because of her advanced uterine cancer. That way, presumably, she could ruin Maxim while accomplishing her goal of dying quickly. Did Rebecca and Mrs. Danvers have a common reason for hating Maxim? If so what was it? Could it be that they both hated men? Could they have had a lesbian relationship? The Production Code wouldn't allow clear evidence for a positive answer. Note that in burning the Manderley, Mrs. Danvers destroys all the remaining physical reminders of Rebecca, as well as herself. This was a suicidal act as well as an act against the de Winters. ",

223,17 March 2019,robfollower,10, My personal favorite. Arguably Hitchcock's greatest film effort,"1940 Hitchcock's first American film (and his only Best Picture winner), Rebecca is a masterpiece of haunting atmosphere, Gothic thrills, and gripping suspense The acting is uniformly excellent. Olivier is the hardened Maxim de Winter, untitled lord of Manderly, trying to forget the past and given to unexpected bouts of anger and coldheartedness. Fontaine is perfect as the unnamed mousy heroine, innocent yet deeply in love, still carrying with her the aura of an awkward schoolgirl. But it is Judith Anderson's role as Mrs. Danvers that viewers are likely to remember best. Her presence is as dark and foreboding as that of the deceased Rebecca herself, and Fontaine is evidently cowed by her icy stare and unnervingly formal manner. The dynamics between the two actresses are wonderful. In a line-up of great motion pictures, ""Rebecca"" stands as one of the giants. It is arguably Hitchcock's greatest film effort",

Fontaine was enchanting as the new Mrs. de Winters.  Its been mentioned, but Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers does add a sense of dread and intrigue into the mix, and was memorable and excellent as well. ",

Because I have infinite respect for Hitchcock, I knew that his choices were carefully planned and that the film would pick up sooner or later.  Of course, it did.  The end of the film was very gripping, but in order to get to that point Hitchcock spent considerable time developing the situation and character interactions within Mandalay.  Looking back on it, the last half of the film wouldn't have been as effective if he hadn't.  ",

The two main leads play their roles perfectly; the mysterious Maxim, of whom acts very suspiciously throughout the film, and the innocent Mrs De Winter who gets involved in an unusual situation and naturally goes a bit crazy as a result. The two have great chemistry and their dialogue is enthralling to watch, culminating in an incredible moment between them near the end of the film where Maxim puts it all on the table. And then there's also the evil Mrs Danvers, who with her insane obsession of the late Rebecca will do anything to ruin the life of the new Mrs De Winter. I also really enjoyed Jack Favell, the snarky blackmailer who steals the few scenes he was in.

238,16 June 2022,laurietallack,4, Interpretation of Favell,"The great George Sanders was used to play Favell, but this seems to miss a point in the original; Sanders plays his part with an upper middle-class accent, impeccably dressed and sipping his Whisky and Soda with all the entitlement of a fellow landowner; but is that what du Maurier intended? It could be argued that the rebellion of Rebecca - and Favell - isn't just personal, but they are in fact standing up to the entitled class hierarchy of Maxim, the local landowner who inherited his wealth. Favell is described as a somewhat drunken lover of Rebecca, talking of 'unions' and 'Marxism', albeit in passing and as a joke, but he grabs the whiskey whenever he can and stuffs cigarettes into his pockets - hardly the actions of the man portrayed in the film - dressed as he is and speaking with that accent. Perhaps Du Maurier intended Rebecca and Favell to be the somewhat working class locals made good, one of them marrying into the gentry and immediately ridiculing the attempted patriarchy and hierarchy of Maxim's class expectations. This becomes interesting because not only are we conspiring with a murderer and accessory by empathising with Maxim and his wife, but we're also confronted with the blatant inequalities of a class hierarchy - and yet still find ourselves on the side of the Maxim - I think the film misses this point.",

But everybody says that sort of thing. What I want to add to the mix is that this is a film in which one of the major players (if not THE major player) never appears and in fact is dead. Who could pull that off any better than Hitchcock? I read somewhere that somebody (Selznick?) wanted a flashback during De Winter's 'confession' in the boathouse -- a flashback showing the events of that fateful evening -- but Hitchcock had the good sense to leave Rebecca unseen and dead -- the flashback would make her a 'real person' and ruin the whole effect. Good for Hitchcock. Why is Hollywood turning out only foul-mouth trash today?,

What is less known is that in the entire fabulous career of Alfred Hitchcock, Rebecca was the only movie that won him a Best Picture award.

It would be well worth anyone watching the film and enjoying the various twists and turns found in the movie. I would suggest that after watching the movie you should also read the book........but read the book only after watching the movie. Hitchcock is at his best in this one and makes use of some very good character actors. One of the things to watch in this movie is the entire lifestyle of the English characters and the way wealthy people live. It is extremely interesting to note various differences in how people react to things in a culture with class distinctions. The housekeeper in this movie is a fascinating and complex character designed after the typical English housekeeper. However, she is like no other housekeeper you'll run into. The main female lead could not have pulled this off any better than she did. The acting is superb and is so believable you find yourself forgetting its a movie. That......to me..........makes for good movie watching. Enjoy!",

After watching this film, it is hard to forget about her extreme coldness and cruelty toward the young Mrs. DeWinter.

255,6 June 2020,dr_clarke_2,6," Enjoyable, but not Hitchcock's finest work","Rebecca is notable for being Alfred Hitchcock's first American film, and his only film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Given that latter point, it's perhaps ironic that he would later go on to make much better films: Rebecca, despite its reputation, is not his finest work.
Rebecca is closely based on Daphne du Maurier's novel of the same name, and sees Joan Fontaine's otherwise unnamed second Mrs de Winter meet and marry rich widow Maxim de Winter, only to discover that the shadow of his deceased first wife Rebecca hangs over their marriage. Part romance and part psychological thriller, the story sees the second Mrs de Winter - through whom the plot is focalised - gradually discover the truth about Rebecca's death.
The problem with the plot is that it changes direction twice, resulting in an uneven feel to the film. The first half sees the second Mrs de Winter meet Maxim, fall in love, get married, and then find herself somewhat lost in his huge mansion Manderley, which is metaphorically haunted by the spectre of Rebecca. The plot shifts halfway through as we start to discover the truth about what happened to her, and then shifts again for the final quarter, as it transpires that Maxim actually hated his first wife and he ends up in the familiar Hitchcock territory of a man desperately trying to clear his name in the face of wrongful accusations about Rebecca's death. All of which makes the film feel top heavy, with a padded first half and a second half that suddenly introduces new characters, most notably George Sander's caddish Jack Favell.
The other problem here is the characterisation. The screenplay is credited to Robert E. Sherwood and Joan Harrison, with adaptation by Philip MacDonald and Michael Hogan, and the involvement of four writers (plus, technically, du Maurier) is perhaps why it is less focused than it could have been. The film's main protagonist the second Mrs de Winter is quite nervous, insecure and basically rather wet during the first half, but suddenly finds new reserves of confidence and determination once she discovers the truth about Rebecca; despite a strong performance from Joan Fontaine, this means she never quite rings true. Similarly, Laurence Olivier's Maxim is by turns cold, warm, distant and vulnerable as the story demands and thus feels less like a real person and more like a function of the plot. Likewise, icy housekeeper Mrs Danvers, who gradually and subtly undermines and persecutes the second Mrs de Winter, suddenly decides to burn Manderley down at the end and kill herself in the process (possibly accidentally) purely out of spite, which feels like a step too far for the character.
But despite these faults, there is much to enjoy and admire here. Hitchcock's characteristic directorial flare is apparent throughout, bringing an appropriately Gothic feel to the film which has aged well. Right from opening scenes, George Barnes' award winning cinematography impresses: the second Mrs de Winter's first view of Manderley is through a rain-sodden windscreen, and after the wide-angled, deep-focus shots of the French Riviera scenes, close-ups and other techniques at Manderley make the excellent sets seem oppressive, whilst at the same time enormous and labyrinthine. Franz Waxman's score - added in by producer Selznick during editing - is a bit intrusive at times, but for the most part is memorably atmospheric as the mood of the film darkens. And whatever the flaws of the characterisation, the acting is superb: there's a lengthy scene in which Maxim reveals the truth about Rebecca, and which consists largely of melodramatic dialogue: Olivier's performance and Hitchcock's direction make it tense and absorbing. Judith Anderson is well cast as the intimidating Mrs Danvers, as is George Sanders as Favell and Florence Bates as Mrs. Van Hopper, the second Mrs De Winter's battleaxe of an employer.
Overall then, Rebecca is perhaps not as a good as its reputation would suggest. Nevertheless, like most Hitchcock films it is worth watching, and is significant for bringing the director to America, where as history has proved, he would go on to make some of his very best films.",

258,8 August 2016,JoeKulik,7, Joan Fontaine portrays a pre-Feminist Clueless Doormat !!!,"I give this film a 7.5 on a 10 point scale. All of Hitch's films, though mostly good, have screenplays that are just unbelievable & improbable to some degree and ""Rebecca"" is certainly no exception. Fontaine's character is S-O-O Weak, Naïve, Passive, & Fragile that it lacks credibility. NO Woman, even in pre-Feminist times, could possibly be as much of a Clueless Doormat as the new Mrs de Winter. That as the new mistress of Mandalay she would have kept that witch Mrs Danvers as the housekeeper is at least very unlikely, especially when Danvers tricked the new Mrs de Winter to wear that dress for the ball. The Mrs Danvers character was rather unreal too. She was much more a caricature than a believable character. Otherwise, a very suspenseful, & well thought out storyline, with great dramatic tension, although the ""dramatic"" was much too ""melodramatic"" in my opinion. How a great director like Hitch got stuck with so many sub-par screenplays is beyond my comprehension.",

Rebecca though still has her secrets as does Maxim. Its up to the second Mrs. de Winter to see that she is not destroyed by them. Even though it is very studioesque ( something rare in a Hitchcock film ), the movie is just sweeps you up into this romantic intrigue. Very good performances by Olivier and Fontaine, but Judith Anderson steals the show. Rating, 9 out of 10.",
261,10 November 2009,bragant,10," ""I am Mrs. de Winter NOW!""","Despite the fact that Hitchcock himself tended to be dismissive about this film (telling Truffaut, ""It has held up remarkably well. I have no idea why.""), REBECCA is undoubtedly one of his timeless classics - the kind of work which has become so embedded in the collective unconscious that certain scenes, lines and characters are mythic, to the point of parody (think of Carol Burnett's riffs on this story in her 1970s comedy show, or Stephen King's use of Mrs. Danvers' image in his ""Bag of Bones""). This is also one of Hitchcock's great crowd-pleasers - when first released, it played in New York for a year - held over repeatedly due to audience demand - and in England the movie went through the roof, running in London for virtually the length of World War II. It's been playing constantly since then in frequent revivals and television screenings. REBECCA's production was fraught with tension and pain: principal photography started only days before the outbreak of WWII, to the great personal distress of the nearly all-English cast and crew; Hitchcock exploited Joan's Fontaine's inexperience by telling her that she was terrible and everyone hated her so as to deliberately keep her in a near-constant state of defensiveness, fear and anxiety which was 100% appropriate for Fontaine's character; and it soon became quite obvious that Selznick and Hitchcock could not stand one another and would be unable to work together in the long run. The resulting motion picture, however, brought nothing but good fortune to everyone connected with it - Laurence Olivier's long-desired Hollywood career finally took off, Hitchcock's reputation in America was secured, Joan Fontaine became an international star overnight, Selznick won his second Best Picture Oscar in a row and dominated world box-office for another year, and Judith Anderson became an icon, just for starters. This is one of those rare instances where a fantastic book was brought to the screen and made into an equally good film. Miss DuMaurier's plot is legendary: On holiday in the south of France, the untitled Cornish nobleman Max de Winter meets and marries a sweet young girl (Fontaine) whose timely attention perhaps stops him from suicide in one of the best meet-and-greets of all time. Mr. de Winter's subsequent proposal (""I'm asking you marry me, you little fool."") rescues the girl from the hell of her life as a paid companion (""I didn't know companionship could be bought,"" says de Winter) to the Gorgon-like American socialite Edythe Van Hopper (Played with true verve by Florence Bates: ""Give me a chocolate quick!"" she cries as she stubs her umpteenth cigarette out in a jar of cold cream). After a whirlwind courtship and fast Italian honeymoon, de Winter brings his bride to the ancestral estate of Manderley. The second Mrs. de Winter is not happy in her new home, which seems to be overshadowed by the presence of Maxim's first wife Rebecca, dead for some time in a boating accident. Matters are not helped by her own complete ineptitude in her new position of Great Lady, or the hostility of the housekeeper, black-clad Mrs. Danvers (superbly incarnated by Dame Judith Anderson in the only successful one-note performance in movie history), who seems to have a strange fixation on her dead mistress, keeping Rebecca's clothes, personal possessions and rooms exactly as they were during Rebecca's lifetime. De Winter himself behaves like a different man - brooding, gloomy, temperamental and even verbally abusive. Poor Joan Fontaine blames herself for her predicament, contrasting her awkward plainness with Rebecca's alleged poise, grace and popularity...After a disastrous development during a costume ball, matters seem even more hopeless when Rebecca's previously-undiscovered body turns up out of nowhere, and it seems Mr. de Winter has a lot of explaining to do...Strong plot and performances aside, this film has a truly unique atmosphere - George Barnes' Oscar-winning cinematography transforms Manderley into a Gothic symphony of light and shadow where unseen forces seem about to manifest themselves at every turn. Perhaps the greatest bit of showmanship is the way the dead, absent Rebecca becomes a major character - in the stunning and very perverse sequence (""Feel this..."") where Mrs. Danvers shows the new Mrs. de Winter Rebecca's things, you can SEE Rebecca in your head while ""Danny"" speaks. While the film is quite long (over two hours), you won't want it to be shorter by one second! A classic for the ages which the whole family can watch and enjoy together.",

266,29 May 2021,Filmdokter,7, Intriguing plot but a bit heavy on the dialogues,The film kicks off quiet slowly and Hitchcock allows to get to know the two lead characters (Fontaine and Olivier). The plot really gets going once the newlyweds arrive at Manderlay. From there the film that's started rather as a romantic story turns into a thriller (what happened to Rebecca?) and a drama (Fontaine and her struggle as the new lady of the house). It is a bit of a shame that the great way in which Hitchcock tells this story visually is sort of abandoned in the final 40 minutes or so. There we have (really) long dialogue scenes that take the thriller bit out the film. A pity but nonetheless a film worthwhile checking out.,

But Olivier is excellent in his effort to act the carefree playboy haunted by his first wife, as is the spectacular supporting cast, the cream of British character acting of the 30's and 40's.  George Sanders plays the part George Sanders always plays (and it is irrelevant whether he is the good guy, as in the Falcon series, or the bad guy, as in most of his other films) and does it better than anyone else can.  Judith Anderson makes your blood curdle while she is being ever so proper and polite.  And then there is the first Mrs. De Winter -- ah, she is the scariest of all to poor, suffering Joan.

They all still miss her and it is obvious that they wanted the new wife to kind of take the place of Rebecca in a way that she just couldn't do. Rebecca had a huge effect on the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers. She even set the house on fire at the end of the movie and ended up dying in the house. The movie had a very surprising ending which I liked. Hitchcock is a great director and you can see that through the movies lighting, camera-work, sounds, and editing.",

It is always amazing how Hitchcock starts with innocuous situation, like a young woman employed as company for an elderly lady, woven together with a chance encounter, and ends up with a tightening noose around his characters. He perfected this in Psycho, and in the late, lesser work Family Plot - which is still remarkable.",

It is brilliantly acted and beautifully shot. It's not exactly scary from the point of view of the audience, but you feel increasingly worried for Joan Fontaine as Rebecca's ghost eat it's way into the movie.",
277,8 December 2019,andrewmerritt-31652,9, A twisted fairy tale,"Rebecca stars Joan Fontaine, Laurence Olivier, and Judith Anderson. The story revolves around a young woman who meets Maxim De Winter and soon becomes his second wife. Later, he takes her to her place named Manderley where she learns a dark secret to his first wife. Rebecca is a twisted fairytale. At the beginning of the film we are introduced to Joan Fontaine who is a shy and insecure woman looking for love. She later meets Maxim De Winter who acts as her prince charming even though he is cruel towards her and she tries everything to escape her evil godmother and eventually the two fall in love and get married. She has this fantasy that he will to her to his palace called Manderley and live happily ever after, but it is far from happy. She is Snow White who wakes up from her coma with the imagination that she will live happily ever after with her prince charming, but once she sees Manderley up close her fairytale is an illusion. Mrs. Danvers is the Queen in the Snow White story who is the scariest woman in movie history. Mrs. Danvers loved the first Mrs. De Winter almost as she were the first wife before the second Mrs. De Winter took her place. All the other characters that we meet along the way are part of the second Mrs. De Winter's fairytale illusion. She's still wants that fairytale to be real and it's the only one living in that fantasy while everyone else is oblivious of the fact that they are also part of the story, but they don't realize it. By this point there is no hope for her as she refuses to be woken up from her dream as she believes that dreams can come true while the first wife was cruel to Maxim. Maxim at once believed that dreams do come true, but once he found out about her real intentions he woke up and realized that his dream was shattered. Alfred Hitchcock takes the beloved fairytale that we all know and turns it upside down and gives it a more gothic tone. Overall, this love story shows us that love is cruel and harsh even though we don't want to accept it. Rebecca took me completely by surprise as it showed me what love is truly about filled with tons of suspense that makes this a great film to watch.",

The film lacks gothic and mysterious elements that are present in Daphne DuMaurier's novel. I feel as if this film was rushed and there was not enough depth to the characters. The build up to the big twist was underwhelming. While reading the book, there was a lot of build up towards the end, preparation. I will admit though, it is hard to fit a storyline that occurs over the course of 6 months into a 2 hour movie. The only reason I am giving this a higher rating is because I think that the the main characters are perfect in their roles.",

This is an early Hitchcock classic that's more mainstream than his later work and, I think, much better.  Pre-WW2, the rich widow Edythe Van Hopper (Florence Bates) decides to spend a few weeks in Monte Carlo with her hired companion/assistant (Joan Fontaine).  When the companion is introduced to the recently widowed, wealthy, and handsome Maxim de Winter (Olivier), she is swept from her feet.  They marry rather quickly and she moves into his mansion.  However the atmosphere is not very welcoming.  Most of the staff is still mourning the recent death of the first Mrs. de Winter, Rebecca, and the new Mrs. de Winter cannot seem to fit in.  Hard enough as it is to live up to the expectations set by Rebecca, it quickly becomes apparent that some of the staff WANT her to fail.  How far will they go?  Excellent film. Maybe Hitchcock's best.",

Hitchcock's movies have a peculiarity. If you see that the beginnings of his movies is good rest assured that by the end of the movie you will be lost for words. He's not only the master of suspense but the master of romance. He makes the world more beautiful and mysterious to me. I wish i could keep this feeling inside a bottle,

Beautifully shot, brilliant acting, casting and directing. I can and have watched this over and over. Drama, suspense, intrigue, mystery. And with the grand old master at the helm of this production, how could you go wrong? If anything, 'Rebecca' is underappreciated. It's a classic and one of my favorite Hitchcock movies. It's a movie students studying film production should watch, because it utilizes light, shadows - and great acting. You can easily get hooked watching this movie. You'd never remake this one as good as this is.",
296,2 September 2000,Hitch-26,9, A Hitchcock Classic,"It is one of the greatest ironies in all of movies that the great Alfred Hitchcock won only one oscar for best picture.  Some people would think it was Rear Window, North by Northwest, Vertigo, or Psycho.  But it was none of those, it was this one, Rebecca(1940).  Although the movie drags a little bit, it really  picks up after the first hour.  Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, and George Sanders all give excellent performances, but it is really Dame Judith Anderson who steals the picture.  Just thinking of how she played Mrs. Danvers gives me chills.  Rumor had it that Hitchcock deliberately made Joan Fontaine feel terrible by claiming to hate her and getting everyone in the movie to dislike her as well, but the reason why he did it was so she would perform in the title role the way Hitchcock envisioned it.  One thing about this movie--I was shocked and you will to when it was revealed in the movie a certain plot element.  If you haven't seen this movie, you need to see it.  Definitely one of Hitch's 10 best.",
297,31 October 2002,nofear1012001,10, Love it or hate it.,This is very much a love it or hate it Hitchcock movie. I think its outstanding. One reason people may hate it is the suspense takes a long time to build up and Hitchcock himself didn't seem to fond of it. But don't let that fool you- this is a great and twisted love story mystery movie. Joan Fontaine's character is one of the greatest reasons to purchase this. This is Hitchcock's first picture in America and his first under producer David O Selznick. Don't miss out on this classic. The Criterion version is recommended once again- a LOT of extras.,
298,29 September 2021,shanie25350,5, Overlong and overrated--not one of Hitchcock's best,"Okay, but overlong and overrated. Lovely cinematography. Great score. I liked Joan Fontaine as Mrs. De Winter and Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers, but did not care for Laurence Oliver's performance as Maxim de Winter at all. I never realized how horribly he mumbled until I saw Rebecca and, after seeing it, couldn't believe he was considered one of the most acclaimed actors of the 20th century. You really need subtitles/closed captioning to understand him in this film. I found Olivier nearly impossible to understand without subtitles--and not necessarily because of his accent, but because he constantly mumbles, merges words together, and is basically incoherent except when he's angry and shouting. Plus, he's totally detached and unemotional and speaks too fast in a cold tone even in the scenes where he's supposed to be falling in love with Joan Fontaine's character. Olivier's performance was very disappointing, and I think just about any other major leading man of that era could have played the role of Maxim de Winter better than he did. At least they would have been more coherent.",

It was the first film either of us had seen of him and his screen presence was really captivating. I never enjoyed the book this movie was based on (gave up roughly fifty pages in), but the film had plenty of atmosphere, suspense and that chilly Mrs. Danvers!",
301,1 March 2021,chrislivings,5, Olivier acted of the screen by a good supporting cast,Massively overlong production. Olivier and Fontaine give understudy performances they just haven't got enough screen presence between them to hold the interest of the viewer there must of been two performers with some chemistry who could of done a better job. In fact you'd never really know this was a Hitchcock directing job it could of been handled by any number of competent directors from the era. If you really want to like it you'll get something out of it otherwise wind forward an hour 25 it takes that long for a story to kick in,
302,11 May 2015,cleigh115,9, Great hitchcock film,"Out of all of the movies of Hollywood's Golden Age, ""Rebecca"" is certainly one of the best. It's an excellent mystery movie! Everything about this movie shines, beginning with the story itself. I really liked the story, in which the title character is a dead woman whose ""presence"" still lingers in many ways. The plot takes quite an unexpected turn near the end of the movie, when a shocking revelation is made. Hitchcock is known for twists and turns that the story and its characters take. There is always at least one big secret hidden away in the story. Secrets that us as viewers seemingly believe our characters have no way out of, but somehow someway the story comes back around and changes our minds. Hitchcock, like several other great directors is always good at creating memorable characters, and this one has plenty. Particularly the housekeeper Mrs. Danvers. She holds the craziest grudge over Rebecca as she enters her newly married life into the mansion. Although I personally found Rebecca's character to be of weak nature, it somehow brings out the cruelty in Mrs. Danvers, giving her an even larger ability to hate the girl. Overall this is an impressive and engaging film that tells a good story with a great approach, producing a dark and interesting film that is driven by an unseen character whether the tone is melodrama, romance or mystery story.",
303,17 December 2015,m-carter-68742,8, Hitchcock does it again,"Albert Hitchcock creates yet another masterpiece. From the start, the cast is like a dream team. The acting was superb., though sometimes over dramatic, but that was common for the time. The music was also spectacular. It allowed for the mood to be set. Both soft and hard shadows were applied when they needed to be. The story was something different, someone being haunted by their husbands dead wife? Thats different even for todays horror type movies. The atmosphere created was brilliant, we know we couldn't see Rebecca, but she had a god like feel. She was always there, manipulating things as she pleased. A different story from the start was made amazing by the stellar actors and actresses involved in this film. Easily a must see for any horror buff",
304,1 November 1998,Moviebuf,9, Haunting and Beautiful,"This early work from Alfred Hitchcock is one of his finest.  His abilities as an auteur are just beginning to develop in this haunting, dark film.  I read the book in high school and saw the movie several years later.  The interpretation is wonderful.  Joan Fontaine plays the mousy second Mrs. deWinter beautifully.  She is a bit more attractive than I had first imagined here in the novel, but her acting ability overcomes that minor drawback.  Also, for the time period, I could not think of a better actor to play Maxim than Sir Laurence Olivier.  Not only is he extremely talented, but he is exceptionally handsome as well.  He is a perfect match against Ms. Fontaine.  The first time I saw the movie, I immediately thought the young Olivier looked and acted like Cary Elwes (a great tribute to the latter!) For Hitchcock and suspense buffs alike, this is a must see!",

The woman named Rebbecca doesn't have a view in this movie but she is so lively in my head as the movie going on. Director uses a lot of invisible hints to describe how Rebecca is. Such as the ""R"" letter showing on the napkin, her dog, and the using habitat of living room are the invisible cues for viewers to think about Rebecca. Those hints perfectly showing a haughty but kind woman for viewers. Also this is one particular view I like most. It is from that dog - Jasper.

Jack Favell seems to be a male version of Rebecca, who hates Maxim out of envy partly, but also because he loathes or is bored by most people -- similar to the way that Rebecca felt, we are led to believe. I think that this is particularly the case since Rebecca and Jack are not from the same socio-economic stratum as Maxim, who ultimately had the most material resources of all the characters. Jack is, in a way, an embodiment of Rebecca, as Danvers is, and he is obsessed with Rebecca, as most of the major characters are except the more stable Bee, Giles, and Frank.",

It has an interesting story that will captivate any audience. At any moment you might think you know exactly where the story is going, but there are just enough twists that you're never bored and are more than likely surprised. The most wonderful part is that there IS a story here. It's not just the glue that hangs by a bead holding together great action or unbelievable mystery and intrigue, though there is a good deal of that as well. It's also a refreshing change that while the basic story for most of us today would remind of us other films, it doesn't smack of a tired story that never should have been retold or changed in any way. It is fresh in a dark and brilliant way. The pace is good and the acting is adept even though one might find it stilted in that reactions may seem canned. It is one of my biggest problems with early films and yet, 'Rebecca' is not limited by this. It is absolutely clear why it is an Oscar winning film.",

Most of the film is awfully boring, needlessly drawn out without any substantial plot or anything to create tension and suspense and I was wondering what is the plot where is this film going to?

322,9 June 2000,orcrush,9," good, but not Hitch's best","A sprawling, romantic, literary drama in the vein of 'Gone With the Wind' does not exactly seem like a typical movie for the so-called 'master of suspense'. And in fact, for much of the movie Hitch seemed out of his element, setting up suspenseful moments, just for the sake of having them, without having any real bearing on the plot. In fact, the plot doesn't even seem apparent until about 2/3 of the way into the picture(which is when you're finally rewarded for enduring the first 6 hours or so). On the other hand, there's nothing wrong with a director stepping out of his element once in a while, and the characters created by Joan Fontaine(who won an Oscar the next year for an inferior Hitch film, Suspicion, in one of the Academy's most blatant make-up votes ever), and Judith Anderson(as one previous reviewer alluded to, Cloris Leachman's comical performance in Young Frankenstein was a certain homage) are among filmdom's all-time best.

324,16 March 2020,asmgodoy,9, A classic by all means,"Not always the title of a novel, or a movie, has to do with the main issue that is treated in the novel, or on the movie. It stands to The Name of Rose (there is no one called Rose in the novel), as well as to the Three Musketeers (Dumas tell us the story of D'Artagnan, and not the story of the musketeers, who are Athos, Porthos, and Aramis). It goes quite perfectly well to Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca. A classic, by all means, Rebecca has been challenging its viewers since 1940, the year it was released. Throughout the movie Rebecca is the main character, she is everywhere, she is in everyone's minds and thoughts, but she never appears. We have no idea of how she was, yet she remains at the core of this charming movie. Sir Lawrence Oliver (by then very you'd and handsome) is a millionaire who marries a humble girl, played by Joan Fontaine. They live in a castle, owned by the sometimes irksome millionaire. But Rebecca, to whom the millionaire was firstly married, seems to be everywhere. To impose herself in this new and aggressive milieu the humble girl has to face Rebecca's ghost.

As an avid reader of Daphne du Maurier and one who loves her critically acclaimed book Rebecca, I found that none of the movie adaptations bring the book to justice. In mostly every movie adaptation there seems to be something lacking, and I think the biggest reason is pacing. Pacing is critical in a movie and truly builds atmosphere and tension. Alfred Hitchcock is a great master at pacing and it truly shines in his film Psycho. However I felt that he did not care for this film. I think, what most of the adaptations miss is the subtleties of Rebecca and Mrs de winter in Monte Carlo.

330,5 October 1999,Skypark,10," Well , it's just another great one from Hitchcock .","Hitch is the best and this proves it. Fontaine is awesome & beautiful. One of Hitch's darkest . Powerful , a movie for all to see !",
331,16 December 2019,goatcheese-25746,7, Underrated Gem,Rebecca is truly an underappreciated Hitchcock movie. It's very Gothicly atmospheric and has a dreamlike feeling.,
332,2 December 1998,nester-2,9, Brilliant early work,"I was a bit worried that I would be disappointed in this early Hitchcock, but this movie had it all.  Some of the artful elements Hitchcock became famous for are already in place, as well as fabulous acting and a wonderful plot.  And isn't it nice to witness a movie unfold, and not be slapped in the face with exploding aliens or a car crash 10 minutes into the movie? This  film doesn't reveal the ""catch"" until 90 minutes in,  but you never feel like a moment was wasted!  Classic for it's 40's chauvinism, too: ""now, be a good girl and finish your food.""  But, I guess, if you watch the film, you find that this attitude is important in developing the characters.",
333,28 April 2023,p-69076-12366,9," Excellent Plot and Acting, Nice Setting, Long Scenes","This movie was one of the best I have seen in a while. To start, it did not stimulate the viewer, as most modern films do with sex or fantastical CGI. Further, this film has an excellent plot which kept me in suspense nearly every moment of the movie. Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs. De Winter was especially great at depicting the part of the new, innocent wife who initially must live in the shadow of the first Mrs. De Winter know as ""Rebecca."" Hitchcock does a great job of using the scenery, especially the symbol of the ocean in the film. My only complaints were that some scenes seemed drawn out or somewhat unnecessary, especially at the beginning, and there are a few instances of obviously fake old-school type acting (in one scene Maxim--Mr. De Winter--""punches"" someone and then there is no mark on the other fellow's face).",

335,5 October 1998,Gene-10,10, Availability of Fantastic Classic Films,REBECCA (1940) is one of the best films that I have ever viewed classic or otherwise.  A fantastic performance by Laurence Olivier which many critics will agree in most all his films. The settings used in many frames were super in presenting the situation being shot at the time.  Considering the time frame (era) in which the movie was depicting has to be a masterpiece. I further believe that it's just a shame that this movie seem to be out of print.  No one seems to have it. No one can order it. No one prints it any more.  A GREAT LOSS TO CLASSIC MOVIE LOVERS. GREAT MOVIE! GREAT CAST! MAGNIFICENT DIRECTOR!  WHAT A LOSS!,
336,17 October 2000,angelofdeath-3,10, Hitchcock's analysis of the past on the present,"'Rebecca' is perhaps the best exponent of a film made on a material level, as oppossed to Felleni's films for example, that explores issues concerning elements of humanity such as guilt (or lack of it) and also the factor of the past creating a voice for itself throughout Hitchcock's adaption of the novel. These issues have been explored more times than anyone would like to remember, but in 'Rebecca' they find voice through Rebecca's ever haunting and ever intrusive presence within the house. Indeed, her memory has found itself to be present in every element of the film, including the sea of course, the letters, statuette's and most importantly every character makes her return into the present. Maxim is the only break in the chain as he wants to forget his past, repress it to the deepest recesses of his mind, whereas he finds this impossible due to her memory almost controlling his future on behalf of those other characters opposed to his ideal.",
337,18 June 2001,s_menchen,10, What Hitchcock was in the 40's,"If one were to ask me who Alfred Hitchcock was, I might tell him/her to just watch ""Rebecca"". It is a magnificent piece of work, and I could watch it over and over again. The cast is terrific, the story couldn't be better, and virtually every element could not be improved. I've given it a 10! Suspense, romance, what more could one want from a movie?",
338,19 May 2023,ravandzaid,6, Rebecca,"That's the essence of Daphne Du Maurier's book, a book which has never gone out of print, speaking to its cross-generational appeal. The past lives around us. Memories ""stir."" The world is in a state of ""furtive unrest,"" it's full of ghosts making demands on the living, the dead exacting revenge from beyond the grave. When the unnamed narrator of marries the widower Maxim de Winter, she barely knows anything about him. Swept away by this dazzling mysterious man, the naive young woman goes back with him to the family manor, a Gothic monstrosity called ""Manderley."" There, she finds herself in a world dominated by the dead Mrs. De Winter, the mythical ""Rebecca,"" whose presence is still felt, in monogrammed pillows, engraved hair-brushes, not to mention the memories of everyone, who all agree she was the most beautiful woman who ever lived. The new Mrs. De Winter fears she will never measure up. Her fears are justified.",
339,28 September 2008,jaaakez99,10, Observation,"Does anyone else think its possible that Mrs. Danvers was either Rebecca's mother or maybe a sister? Given Hichcocks hobby of adding subtle items into his movies, this idea is plausible from the Director's motive. That Director's like to add their own styles to books and plots makes my observation also plausible. Couple of comments in the movie that have led me to this question are the Dr.'s comment at the end of the movie that ""Mrs. Danvers had been coming to see him for years"". Also that Rebecca uses the name Mrs. Danvers. The other thing that makes it possible is that Rebecca had a sordid past, according to Max's narration of their visit 4 days after their marriage.",
340,4 July 2007,AugDog,10, Pioneer of the Used Car Salesman Character,"Hitchcock deserves props for his role in developing the Sleazy Car Salesman archetype with George Sander's Jack Favell. At the beginning, Favell appears as a dashing, charming bachelor (think a more rugged Hugh Grant.) By the end, he is a sleazy, blackmailing, cousin-humping, used-car salesman . . . he literally is a car salesman (in a scene near the conclusion, he implores the chief constable to come see him if he needs a new car.) Hitchcock helped pave the way for future ""Sleazy Car Salesman"" characters such as William H. Macy's Jerry Lundegaard in ""Fargo"" and Robin Williams' Joey O'Brien in ""Cadillac Man"" to name a couple. ",
341,25 April 2005,hilarygirl13,10, Joan Fontaine's character is nameless,"If you are into scary movies, this is the best. My mom was jumping every five seconds and finally left after screaming her head off! I guess this is a spoiler--in a way, about the dress. The dress Mrs. Danvers convinced Joan Fontaine to wear--it was rather predictable. So, that is sort of a spoiler. Anyway, it was really creepy, and (another spoiler if you didn't see it) Mrs. Danvers' face in the end was REALLLYY creepy. But did you notice that Joan Fontaine is credited as ""the second Mrs. DeWinter, and she doesn't have a first name. Mr. DeWinter just calls her ""dear"" or ""darling."" She doesn't have a name, because it is overshadowed by the first Mrs. DeWinter. CREEPY MOVIE ALERT! This movie is not rated, because it is so old, but I would rate it PG-13 for disturbing images.",
342,4 February 2014,lgirlproductions,10, A great classic movie,"Contains spoiler alert. This one is probably one of my all time favourite classic movies. The intensity hits you from the opening scenes. Mrs. Danvers is one hell of a scary housekeeper. She holds the craziest grudge over Rebecca as she enters her newly married life into the mansion. Although I personally found Rebecca's character to be of weak nature, it somehow brings out the cruelty in Mrs. Danvers, giving her an even larger ability to hate the girl. This movie is filled with mystery, murder, romance and a who done it plot. If you love the old classic movies and haven't yet watched this one, I would recommend getting hold of a copy somehow. A great Sunday afternoon movie to watch.",
