0,18 December 2013,gogoschka-1,10," ""Luke"" is a character Newman was born to play - and this is one hell of a beautiful film","This film got me from the first frame to the last. It's not even because of the story (which I love, of course) - it's just so very well made. And so modern. The kind of angles and perspectives the camera uses, the way it zooms in and out or even allows itself (literally) to get dirty - the way this whole picture was shot is just something I haven't seen in an American film released prior to this one.

1,21 June 2012,ferguson-6,9, What we have here is no failure,"Greetings again from the darkness. I went way too many years without watching this movie again, so when Cinemark included it in the summer classic film series, I was in my seat nice and early. Mention this movie and the first thing people do is quote one of the most famous lines in movie history: ""What we have here is failure to communicate."" No question that's a great line. But there is so much more to this movie and it holds up beautifully 45 years later.",r

5,6 November 2000,rupie,8, memorable,"Truly a memorable movie, and more than just a documentary about southern road gangs. It's a study on the theme of the indomitability of the human spirit in the face of oppression. I was about to name this as Newman's finest performance until I thought of Eddy Felsen in ""The Hustler"" and Frank Galvin in ""The Verdict""; it's impossible to choose among such a cornucopia of acting achievements, but Luke is right up there (the analogy to Luke as Christ becomes a tad heavy-handed when we see him, at the close of the egg-eating scene, stretched out, arms outward, feet crossed, as if crucified; none the less, it's a powerful image). There is no doubt, however, about George Kennedy as Dragline; it is his finest achievement, and fully deserves the Oscar he got for Best Supporting Actor. It is also fascinating to find so many familiar faces among the inmates - actors such as Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton, Joe Don Baker, Ralph Waite. and Wayne Rogers - who would go on to fame in their own right. This movie can unquestionably be called a classic. American Movie Classics just started (11/2000) showing a beautifully restored letterbox version which shows it in all its glory.",e

7,21 June 2012,ma-cortes,7, Unforgettable Paul Newman as a cool prisoner in a Southern chain gang who flees and is recaptured,"Interesting flick about the deprivations and subhuman conditions of a chain gang and a rebel prisoner to whom wardens will attempt to break his free spirit . Based on a real story by Donn Pearce who wrote the novel on which the movie is based , he spent 2 years on a chain gang for safe-breaking ; Pearce makes a cameo appearance in the movie as a convict named Sailor . It deals with Luke (Paul Newman ) who is sent to a prison camp , where he gets a reputation as a hard man . He becomes a prisoner on a Southern chain gang , there the head of the gang hates him , and attempts to break him by beating him up . It doesn't work, and he gains respect and not even the deprivations of these wrong conditions will break his spirit . Irrepressible Luke even manages to win the admiration of his rival (George Kennedy) in the chain gang . Luke is visited by his ill mother (Jo Van Fleet was only 11 years older than Paul Newman , Bette Davis was first offered the role of Luke's mother, but refused the bit part) ; after that , Luke refuses to conform to life in a rural prison and he getaways , but is caught, but escapes again .",/

9,9 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10, The quintessential Paul Newman movie,"I like Paul Newman, he is very likable while being suitably brooding and intense in his films. To me, as much as I do like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Cool Hand Luke is my favourite movie of this great actor. What of Newman himself? Well he is just superb here, very cool and charismatic as well as the skills he is best at. The cinematography is also a delight, the Technicolour is just stunning, and Stuart Rosenberg's direction is a career-best. The dialogue is crisp and memorable, and the story is beautifully constructed. As for any memorable scenes, the prologue and the egg-eating scene are classics, the film succeeds adeptly at being a character study and I for one had no problem with the religious symbolism. Lalo Schifrin's music is very nice too. So all in all, if you love Paul Newman, you will love Cool Hand Luke. 10/10 Bethany Cox",w
10,2 February 2008,ackstasis,8," ""Sometimes nothing can be a pretty cool hand.""","'Cool Hand Luke (1967)' was and remains one of Paul Newman's most iconic performances, with the image of Luke Jackson  with his piercing blue eyes, blissfully carefree smile, dogged determination  forever entrenched in the minds of all who see the film. Having experienced a lifetime of difficulty and oppression, Luke is one man who never learned to conform to society, and who is willing to sacrifice himself in order to avoid compromising his own integrity. On many occasions, the motivation behind Luke's actions are dubious at best {his numerous escape attempts appear to have been orchestrated for the mere sake of rebellion}, but this all adds to the lure of his enigmatic personality. Many critics have noted the film's scattered Biblical references, with some proposing that Newman's character is an allusion to Christ, who mentored a group of ""disciples"" before offering his own life in the face of tyranny. Directed by Stuart Rosenberg, and wonderfully captured by cinematographer Conrad L. Hall {whose final film, 'Road to Perdition (2002)' is among the most beautiful of the new century}, the story of ""Cool Hand Luke"" remains one of cinema's most definitive prison dramas.",5

14,6 November 2016,SimonJack,9," One person can give purpose to life for others, no matter where","The many other reviews posted by the time of my writing discuss the plot and other aspects of ""Cool Hand Luke."" So, I'll just comment on the source of the movie and what I think the aim was in making it. The film is based on a 1965 novel of the same title, by Donn Pearce. The premise for which Luke is jailed and then continues to try to buck the system, escape and then return is ludicrous. Unless one can see that Luke puts life and energy into the prison and his fellow inmates. He is a spark of hope that helps these men survive otherwise monotonous and endless days of drudgery. I don't know if it is that way in the book, but that seems to be the intended drive for the plot in the film. It shows how much difference one person can make – not just in prison, but in the life of other people wherever they are. ",0

16,22 February 2019,robfollower,8, Paul Newman was nominated for an Oscar and George Kennedy received one for his work in this allegorical prison drama.,"Paul Newman was nominated for an Oscar and George Kennedy received one for his work in this allegorical prison drama. Luke Jackson (Paul Newman) is sentenced to a stretch on a southern chain gang after he's arrested for drunkenly decapitating parking meters. While the avowed ambition of the captain (Strother Martin) is for each prisoner to ""get their mind right,"" it soon becomes obvious that Luke is not about to kowtow to anybody. When challenged to a fistfight by fellow inmate Dragline (George Kennedy), Luke simply refuses to give up, even though he's brutally beaten. Luke knows how to win at poker, even with bad cards, by using his smarts and playing it cool. Luke also figures out a way for the men to get their work done in half the usual time, giving them the afternoon off. Finally, when Luke finds out his mother has died, he plots his escape; when he's caught, he simply escapes again. Soon, Luke becomes a symbol of hope and resilience to the other men in the prison camp -- and a symbol of rebelliousness that must be stamped out to the guards and the captain. Along with stellar performances by Newman, Kennedy, and Martin, Cool Hand Luke features a superb supporting cast, including Ralph Waite, Harry Dean Stanton, Dennis Hopper, Wayne Rogers, and Joe Don Baker as members of the chain gang.",3
17,9 May 2006,JamesHitchcock,9, The Sin of the Angry Believer,"This film is set in America's Deep South in the years after the Second World War. Luke Jackson, a down-on-his-luck war veteran, is arrested for vandalising parking meters while drunk and sentenced to imprisonment in a brutally tough prison. At first his offhand, seemingly arrogant, attitude alienates not only the prison governor and guards but also his fellow-prisoners, and he is soon challenged to a fight by another inmate named Dragline. The tall, powerfully built Dragline is an easy victor, but Luke's determination and fighting spirit, never knowing when he is beaten and refusing to quit, arouse the respect of the others, especially Dragline who becomes his close friend. Luke becomes a hero to the prisoners because they see him as a rebel who refuses to be beaten by the system. (His nickname stems from the cool way in which he plays a hand at poker, but it also refers to his remaining cool in the face of persecution). Luke makes two escape attempts, but on both occasions he is recaptured and brought back to the prison for punishment by the guards who are determined to break his spirit. It seems that they have succeeded, but then Luke and Dragnet make one last break for freedom.",/

19,15 April 2016,prodigalorphan-72099,10, A classic that became a big part of my life,"I first saw ""Cool Hand Luke"" the first week it came out. Went to see it with my father at a theater on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. We were just a few blocks away from the hospital where my Mom was dying of cancer and we just needed a break. It was cathartic. Feeling as beat up and left for dead as I was at the time, I came across a character who knew how to take the punches. ""Luke"" is a beautifully crafted film. Not one wasted frame or moment. Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson's screenplay is nothing less than a working man's parable of a truly good soul who just couldn't seem to get a break. In ways, it could be said he truly didn't let himself. But the strength within Luke that would not let him compromise who he was for who he was told to be, the resilience to fight back against those who tried to fight him on that was inspirational. Whether it was a carefully chosen remark or just one of them Luke looks, They knew They couldn't knock him out no matter how badly They knocked him down. Seems he handled life like that, and it was an example I've clung to and have tried to follow in the almost fifty subsequent years. Conrad Hall's cinematography was breathtaking, providing the scope of all the integral parts of the story with the immediacy of all the most intimate moments. Any single frame could hang on your living room wall as the centerpiece. The cast: Dennis Hopper, Strother Martin, Lou Antonio, Ralph Waite ... and George Kennedy. Academy Award Winner George Kennedy. ""Dragline"". The most unforgettable ""gentle giant"" I believe I've ever seen on the silver screen. Each and every one of them, in all their glory and in the simplest of nuances, helped raise Paul Newman's masterful portrayal to an ever higher level, maybe his best work ever. The character is very much the story in ""Cool Hand Luke"" and the ensemble brings it to life. Frustrating, challenging, confusing, pain- in-the-ass life with just enough of that rebellious spirit to bring hope to those facing some of their tougher times. I saw the film four more times that first year, and probably twice each year since whenever I could find it. Check in with Luke and the boys for a breath of fresh air and some world-shaking hope. Can't speak for anyone else, but Luke is right up there with Atticus Finch for me when it comes to celluloid heroes, these are the two whose stories got me through some really, really bleak times. And for me, ""Cool Hand Luke"" was ultimately a story of hope. The story of a man who never gave in. Never gave up. And never stopped grinning. All that they piled on him, all they tried to bury him under ... just wasn't worth his getting worked up over. Wasn't gonna get to his spirit.",r
20,17 September 2006,Quinoa1984,9, a classic anti-hero and a near-great Hollywood prison movie of the 1960s,"I read another comment on here that said that this and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest are two films which are pretty much identical. While I was watching Cool Hand Luke I did recollect the other classic (to me still much more extraordinary) guys-locked-up movie Cuckoo's Nest, as it did have its hero knocking an authority as tough as a ton on bricks. But there's a big difference between the two films- in Cuckoo's Nest, you had in Nicholson a rebel-rouser who didn't mind getting some real words across to people with his plight, and the people he was locked up with are actually, to a basic degree, sane. Newman is, much as the title suggests, 'cool', as he really doesn't have that much dialog for most of the picture, and the system he's bucking isn't supposed to be ""helping"" him and the people he's with. They're there on the chain gang to bust ass and do the work that nobody in their right mind would do unless pointed by a gun to do so. Though on the other hand, this dynamic from Newman, amid a very good prison movie, still makes Cool Hand Luke quite memorable for its ways of bucking the system.",e

He is sentenced to two years on a prison farm in Florida run by a stern warden, the Captain (Strother Martin), and guarded by a stoic rifleman, Walking Boss Godfrey (Morgan Woodward).

28,30 March 2015,brchthethird,10, The power of non-conformity,"One problem with society is its tendency to marginalize those who are different or don't fit in and, to a degree, this is what ""Cool Hand Luke"" is about. Luke is a loner who is picked up by the cops one evening for cutting the heads off parking meters while drunk. However inconsequential this crime might seem, it gets him two years on a chain gang and what transpires over the next couple of hours shows how one man resists a system which seemingly has no place (or use) for him. Despite the overall downbeat tone, the film still manages to have a sense of humor which is heavily derived from situations that one might find while in prison. It also helps that Paul Newman as Luke is so likable and ""cool."" The title of the film comes from a scene in which Luke is playing poker with the other guys and wins by bluffing the other guy into folding. He says that ""Sometimes nothing is a cool hand,"" and from then on is called ""Cool Hand Luke."" Aside from Paul Newman's excellent performance, Strother Martin gives a great turn as the prison captain who, while seemingly easygoing on the surface, is quite authoritarian and does everything in his power to beat Luke into submission. He also gets an awesome quote which has become quite famous: ""What we've got here is a failure to communicate."" Not only is that a great line, but the way in which he delivers it suggests a weariness with the way that Luke has thus far managed to resist being broken. It was also nice to see Harry Dean Stanton, Ralph Waite and Dennis Hopper in supporting roles. Lastly, the cinematography and score by Lalo Schifrin were also excellent. My favorite element was a repeated closeup of a guard's sunglasses which showed the reflection of what he was looking at, and in general, the on-location shooting gave a very palpable sense of what the characters were feeling whether it was the scorching sun or pouring rain. Overall, this is an outstanding entry in that latter days of Hollywood's golden age which has been extremely influential on the films that have come after it. Whether you feel like you fit in or not, ""Cool Hand Luke"" tells a great story with fine performances from its cast.",r
29,10 March 2002,rmax304823,9," Shaking' it here, boss!","Paul Newman can sleepwalk his way through a movie. Don't bother seeing ""Torn Curtain,"" for instance. But give him the right part, engage his interest, catch him in the right mood, and he delivers a performance as good as anyone could provide. As good as Brando, Olivier, as good as anybody. In my estimation he has given at least four performances that reach asymptote: ""The Hustler,"" ""Hud,"" ""Cool Hand Luke,"" and ""The Verdict."" Others may have been almost as good, ""Hombre"", maybe, or ""Harper"", but they restricted his acting to a stereotype or else the story wasn't worth much effort. ",v

32,2 January 2016,sol-,8, About nonconformity,"Sentenced to a stint on a chain gang for a minor offence, a disillusioned former soldier becomes an unexpected role model for his fellow inmates due to his unwillingness to conform in this iconic prison movie starring Paul Newman. Often cited as one of Newman's finest performances, 'Cool Hand Luke' certainly provides him with one of his most complex and dynamic characters as he has to balance pretending to be subdued by the wardens and actually feeling subdued by their harsh treatment. It is also easy to relate to Luke's uncertainty with what he wants to do with the rest of his life, which surfaces in a touching scene in which he is visited by his mother who is shocked that he has no plans for the future. As the film progresses though, Luke becomes bent on escaping captivity, and the way he is treated, it is hard to blame him. On the same note though, his wanting to escape goes directly against his characterisation as a man with no plans for the future. It also never quite gels that he would escape given that he was serving a quite minimal sentence. Prison escape movies are almost always interesting though, and Luke's ingenuity is remarkable in itself. The entire film is also buoyed up by the genuine sense of camaraderie that radiates between the prisoners throughout; they are not out to attack one another, but rather share a strong bond similar to POW inmates. The film has several memorable scenes too beyond the famous ""failure to communicate"" exchanges and Lalo Schifrin's slowly swelling score is a blast, especially during a pivotal boxing match.",

34,12 October 2008,moonspinner55,7, Nobody up there likes him...,"Rabble-rouser from the 1960s isn't as fresh (or as hard-hitting) today as it must have been in its time. Hell-raising ne'er-do-well with nothing to lose winds up on a prison chain-gang, setting a new pace for the guards and other inmates. Fairly straightforward crowd-pleaser, though with odd flickers of melodrama, heightened by Stuart Rosenberg's overeager direction and Lalo Schifrin's mercurial score. In its latter stages, the overlong film appears to aspire to loftier meanings, but for the most part it's Chain-Gang 101--though well-played by Paul Newman, Oscar winner George Kennedy, and a solid, sometimes funny and colorful supporting cast. The central character's sunny rebellion turns serious by the midway point, and director Rosenberg overdoses on inmate clichés, but one is so apt to be drawn to Newman's characterization that the sour residue the movie leaves behind is not likely to catch up to viewers until later. *** from ****",

But it was made, keep in mind, in an era when assembly line symbolism was all the rage, and mainstream American movies were often hard pressed to express some kind of 'heavy' relevance. The film is actually a good deal less pretentious than it sounds, with attractive photography, several notable performances, and a lively sense of humor helping to offset the lazy pacing and obvious emphasis on subtext.

Admittedly I had for some reason imagined it was about gambling and not a prison film. Not that I'm keen on gambling films which always seem to go the same agonising way but prison films as well if they are serious and involve prolonged periods of guys testing themselves against each other in a closed environment. WIP are OK because the focus is inevitably not on male bonding or rivalry which is what seems to have no interest for me. So here I found the first fifty minutes or so rather tedious and uninteresting in the extreme, the middle section unpleasant and nasty and the end rather silly. Presumably what I don't like about this film is what some do and here I'm thinking particularly of protracted scenes of semi naked men sweating in the midday sun with bosses being bossy, a heavy overtone of religious symbolism and an overriding tendency towards glorifying sadistic behaviour. Thinking about it those three do fit quite nicely together and are epitomised by the fearsome boxing encounter and the well filmed but horrible egg eating sequence which culminates in Newman laid out as if crucified and abandoned. The only exception to all this is the rather exceptional sequence of the buxom and barely clad young lady supposedly cleaning the car but seemingly more like offering herself teasingly to the inmates digging their trench. Although even here there seems just as much attention on those bulging and sweating male chests as on the young girl's body parts. In conclusion, I would mention that any film with Harry Dean Stanton seems to get my hackles up and here it is all the worse in that it falls to him, in the main, to sing the spirituals, another element of the level of religiosity it was felt appropriate to lay over this peculiar little, yet overlong, film.",

There is an interesting turning point in the film where Luke (Paul Newman) refuses to shelter from a deadly(?) rainstorm with the rest of the gang, and defies God to do anything to him; his character is defined by this sort of bravado. In the next scene, he learns that his beloved mother has died and the famous 'Plastic Jesus' song scene follows. Luke then simply becomes reckless and hurtles towards his doom.",
44,25 October 2005,krorie,10, Prison As The Establishment,"I never really thought much of Paul Newman's acting until he played Cool Hand Luke. When I was growing up in the 1950's, I viewed Newman as sort of a poor man's Marlon Brando. Even his glorious role in ""Cat On a Hot Tin Roof,"" I viewed as mainly an attempt to emulate Brando's magnificent performance in ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" I was impressed by his role in ""Hud,"" but thought that was due more to the excellent script and direction than to his performance. But with ""Cool Hand Luke"" I came to realize what a truly gifted actor Paul Newman is. Like any great actor, Newman actually becomes his character, a nonconformist of a prison community who would rather die than surrender his individuality. He captures the essence of the protagonist who is rebelling against the system or as it was termed in the 1960's, the establishment. Without Newman this film would have gone nowhere, not even with the brilliant performances of the rest of the cast, especially those of Strother Martin, George Kennedy, J.D. Cannon, and Jo Van Fleet.",

46,9 February 2008,blanbrn,7, Working on a chain gang! One of the better old fashioned prison films of all time!,"At it's time in 1967 ""Cool Hand Luke"" was clearly a masterpiece a work of art in it's time frame with it's main theme being to learn to adapt to the rules of conformity. Set in the rural south classy Paul Newman plays Luke a southerner who's rebellious and a loner. So upon his arrest for another petty crime it's off to a camp that's rural just like a work style road prison. The work is harsh ranging from digging ditches, shoveling dirt, and cutting and chopping hay. Along the way for Luke learning to adapt is a struggle, yet help is provided from fellow prisoner Dragline(George Kennedy)I must say that George gives a fine and likable performance by showing his character could be such an anti establishment role model. Very memorable is the accent and performance of camp captain played by Strother Martin who chills Luke with one of the most memorable and famous lines in cinema history ""What we've got here is... failure to communicate"" Though the film is not a modern day prison film and seems outdated to some the film is with rich humor and clever in it's own way. Especially during the chase scene when Luke uses pepper to throw off the smell of the chasing dogs. And the storytelling is powerful with the scenes of the inmates communicating by folk music and hymns. Overall a powerful film about trying to adjust to conformity, and it shows at the same time it's so hard when a strong detached and indifferent character like Luke is just so prone to the crime of non conformity.",

His performance, as well as that of George Kennedy, are striking. It could be the best he has done although he has so many other fine movies.

What really gets me though this time around is this metaphor for non-conformity and how much fighting the system alone can wear someone down and eventually break their spirit. An aimless man refusing to bend or be broken only to be worn down to nothing. This is a tough movie though.

Luke becomes the star of the chain gain due to his fighting spirit and courage in defying the prison guards. Amid constant threat of punishment, each building in cruelty, Luke continues his quest to escape. Surprising amount of emotional depth throughout.

The movie is one of great memorable moments such as the mass egg eating scene, the road sanding scene, and the brilliant part in which Newman sings a few lines of plastic Jesus that shows exactly how he's feeling more than normal spoken words ever could.

A group of prisoners work on a chain gang, one of whom (Luke, played by Paul Newman in what is not his greatest performance) refuses to bow down to the system. But at first, he is not especially defiant and his antics seem more like pranks, played to test his own character and to give him something to do, but there's never a sense that too much is riding on them; and the soundtrack seems to emphasise the comic over the grave. Then his mother dies, he attempts to escape, the guards turn nasty and eventually he is engaged in a fight for his life and integrity. The disconnected nature of the two halves of the film means that neither is especially effective; some scenes are entertaining but the whole does not cohere, and Luke seems too simplistically nice to really convince as a prison hard-man.

73,9 February 2008,dave13-1,9, Seminal 60s movie,"A work prison serves as a setting for a showdown between rigid established authority and anarchic rebellion. By extension, this is a social metaphor for everything that happened in the 60s - Kent State, the Chicago 7, etc. The 60s were about rebelling against and trying to change the established order and having those in power strike back, usually with excessive force, and Cool Hand Luke is all of this in miniature. Here Paul Newman plays Luke, the essential rebel without a cause, butting heads with prison warden Strother Martin, who tells him, in a perfect encapsulation of the Establishment's attitude toward the youth of the 60s, ""Boy you need to get yourself right in the head..."" Martin gets the script's best material as the spokesman for Law and Order, warning the new cons, ""Man tries to run, he gets hisself a set of leg-irons. He runs twice, he gets two sets. Don't nobody get a third set."" In his world, as in the button down world of LBJ and Nixon, the most the individual could hope for was to be ignored. To raise a fuss was to get slapped down. The supporting cast is superb, especially George Kennedy as a tough, none-too-bright convict who becomes a reluctant admirer of the cool, anarchic Luke, marveling how ""He just kept coming back with nothing."" The script is a marvel, wonderfully memorable and full of ideas and attitudes about society, the value of and need for regulations, the place of the individual etc. and very entertaining, despite a bleakly existential message: there is no salvation or redemption, no reward for virtue, merely consequences for getting out of line. Also significant is the fact that the picture is firmly set in the humid, sun-scorched Deep South with its backward looking traditions and entrenched unwillingness to modernize. A rebel is not only slapped down, he is dragged backward in time against his will. So much here is watchable, meaningful and resonant that even 40 years later it deserves an audience.",
74,10 February 2019,zardoz-13,10, One of Paul Newman's Best Movies,"Director Stuart Rosenberg's chain-gang melodrama ""Cool Hand Luke"" chronicles the imprisonment of the eponymous character that Paul Newman plays in this adaptation of Donn Pearce's novel. This is one of Newman's more entertaining epics as he spends his time at a compound surrounded by high wire fences where prisoners are used on various jobs, such as cleaning roads. The cast is quite diverse, with George Kennedy taking top honors as a thick-headed fellow named Dragline. Perhaps the funniest scene occurs when our hero enters a competition to eat dozens of eggs. One of the more memorable characters in this drama set in the deep South is a prison guard, Boss Godfrey (Morgan Woodward), who sports a set of mirror sunglasses. He is in charge of keeping the prisoner from escaping, and he is a deadly shot with his rifle. At one point, he shoots a giant turtle and has Luke (Paul Newman of ""The Left-Handed Gun"") fetch the creature from a ditch. The official in charge of the prison is simply known as Captain (Strother Martin of ""Fool's Parade""), and he utters the most memorable line in the screenplay co-scripted by Frank Pierson and Pearce: ""What we have here is a failure to communicate.""

Basically Lucas 'Luke' Jackson (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Paul Newman) is sent to prison camp after cutting heads off parking metres, and gets a reputation as a hard man, and he gains an enemy with leader of the prisoners Dragline (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated George Kennedy). Luke is very competitive, and not afraid to prove himself in a challenge, whether it be boxing, a game of poker - where he gets his nickname, or eating fifty boiled eggs without puking. He seems to be used to the prison camp life until his mother dies, and that is when he begins a constant attempt to escape. He manages to escape twice and get quite far, but they catch him both times, and the final time, joined by now friend Dragline, he is shot. Also starring J.D. Cannon as Society Red, Lou Antonio as Koko, Robert Drivas as Loudmouth Steve, Strother Martin as Captain, Jo Van Fleet as Arletta, Live and Let Die's Clifton James as Carr, Morgan Woodward as Boss Godfrey, Luke Askew as Boss Paul, Marc Cavell as Rabbitt, Dennis Hopper as Babalugats, Harry Dean Stanton as Tramp, Licence to Kill's Anthony Zerbe as Dog Boy and Joe Don Baker as Fixer. Newman is superb is the leading role, I can see reasons why Kennedy got the Oscar, and there are plenty of influential moments to be enjoyed, a great prison drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Music for Lalo Schifrin and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. Paul Newman was number 16 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Luke Jackson was number 30 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, ""What we've got here is failure to communicate"" was number 11 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, the film was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments for the girl washing her car, and it was number 71 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers.

Maybe not every role, because Newman was an Actors Studio's student - not Mac Queen - for instance CAT ON A HOT IN ROOF, SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH or FROM THE TERRACE, maybe too ""intellectual for Mac Queen. But for the rest, why not Newman in BULLIT, or THE SAND PEEBLES - which very ending is similar to the COOL HAND LUKE (the hero killed by a rifle shot, in a Church, or temple, with surprise on his face.) or in LE MANS ; don't forget that Paul Newman actually was a pilot in Le Mans car race for several years.

Brilliant performance by Paul Newman as the titular Luke who's put in prison and endears himself with the rest of the guys with his can-do, jokey attitude and willingness to do stupid stuff as well as his aloof and singular need to break the rules. The egg scene was really funny. Humour, drama and quite a lot of heart, and an interesting study in human behaviour and dog psychology. Really enjoyed it, didn't know what to expect but can see shades of every other jailhouse drama in this. Shows how a film can be honest and psychologically affecting without resorting to graphic violence and brutality. This is a clever film, and his character is intelligent and crazy - dangerous because he just doesn't care and is somewhat damaged and at odds with God. A young Dennis Hopper puts in an appearance.

It was nice seeing a very young Ralph Waite,Waltons patriarch, very young Dennis Hopper and of course Strother Martin, who teamed up with Newman in Slapshot. I digress. This movie was basically about an impish 30 something guy that got bored easily. Thus his antics that got him in jail also got him in trouble while he was in jail. Newman was a thrill seeker . The fact he was a military man further shows he is a man that likes to take challenges in life whether they are acceptable of society or not. He is not a sociopath ... more like a goof ball if you ask me. The fact that he had 2 year prison sentence is irrelevant. He tried to escape for the challenge more than anything else. He seemed to enjoy the camaraderie of the cell . The cell was more like an army barrack anyway where everyone slept in one big room. Thus the fact he kept fighting when he clearly lost , also he got involved in that lame egg eating challenge. Attempt escape of prison with year and half or so to go is on the surface a very stupid thing to do, most of us can agree. Especially in a prison that , truthfully , did not seem all that hardened to me. Again, Luke was a thrill seeker and had no choice in his mind. When they showed that picture of Luke with the debutantes looking completely different that was another example of that being the case. Luke was the type of guy that would sneak into a super bowl, attempt to do Evel Knievel type stunts or even Harry Houdini type stunts. The plot was that simple. The ending was awesome and always look for LUKES smile. That is telling . Great movie and great acting . If they do one thing to properly memorialize Mr. Paul Newman , I ask they do nothing... in other words , no remakes of this great piece of film writing.",

Cool Hand Luke also caught me because of its portrayal of the strong bonds between men, it's also a beautiful showcase of masculinity with luke as the unsettled rebel, Courageous, perseverant, cool and stoic.... etc representing the man model, however, it's these patterns that lead to his end. Yet, masculinity and men bonds aren't the main subjects of this film. The storyline of Luke is one of a tortured and free man brawling with this freedom and struggling to give meaning to his bleak life. Luke self-destructive behavior leads him to this work- camp/prison where he was supposed to get his mind right and comply with rules and standards. however, this place makes him more resilient to find his own way in life, trying to escape as he realizes he can't fit in with these ideals. Even if at some point we see him regretting not starting a home and settling down. It was stirring, as he turned to god and tried belief as his last resort in one of the most classical and best scenes of cinema, in my opinion. All this to end up to the realization that he was on his own. Add to it Paul Newman nailed his role, he gave his complex character this enthralling charisma and infectious witt but most importantly he triumphed at portraying the light and smiley despair of luke.

"" The Warden of the prison seek to crush his independent spirit so when Luke's mother dies, he is unexpectedly placed into 'The Box'. Unfairly punished, Luke accepts the challenge and retaliates. There after it's a question of time before, Luke is beaten or he makes good his escape. A number of notable stars can be seen in featured parts who also make this film the Classic it has become. Men such as George Kennedy, Strother Martin as the Captain, Morgan Woodward, Luke Askew, Dennis Hopper, Wayne Roger, Harry Dean Stanton, Ralph Waite, and Anthony Zerbe are the strength of this very serious film. The question lingers, is it Luke or the Captain who is responsible for the remark, ""what we have here, is a failure to communicate."" Is the law guilty of provocation when one is punished unjustly for a minor infraction? Only the audience knows. This movie is easily recommended to all Newman fans. ****",

Not only is this picture extremely dated, and it shows, but the movie is wholly unconvincing. And quite frankly, Paul Newman in the lead gives a performance of utter blandness. The most laughable thing about this picture is how the likes of the individual who wrote the headline comment here (titled 'the evangelist') can write such twaddle and pretentious nonsense.

Perhaps the following observation might qualify as such a point. Over the years---I have increasingly reflected upon the perhaps novel idea that CHL and the movie version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest ((OFOTCN) may have sufficient similarities so as to make it reasonable to compare and contrast them with each other.,
106,20 October 2020,Kingslaay,6, A product of its time,"Cool Hand Luke would have greatly appealed to the men of the time. Luke Jackson was an anti-hero which was unique in those days. A quite, self confident and very laid back southerner that many would have felt was the epitome of masculinity. The prison setting also says a lot. All white men who are collegial and most of the time live in harmony with no presence or even mention of anyone different to them. It is all too easy for them to quickly revere and rally around laid back Luke with close to no backstory or reason. As a character Luke is never fully explored nor is there any strong substance driving this story. Paul Newman is a great actor and icon but the film leaves a lot to be desired. You end up having 2 hours of film with no ground covered, great directors have done a lot with less. But again its a product of its era and sold to a different kind of audience with a certain exposure.",

The moral of the story: Well, sometimes prophets are more successful than other times. Sometimes their message changes humanity and sometimes they just get dead, as was the case for Luke. This is one truly great movie. To think that movies like ""The Departed"" and ""No Country for Old Men"" are winning best Picture awards while this picture did not, mmmmm what's the message here. Hollywood does have it's moments such as ""Crash"" of 3 years ago, but seems to be rewarding mediocrity more often these days.",

This movie resonated with me like no other before, and I can see what many reviewers mean when they use the term ""life changing."" It really is a spiritual experience in a way no Ingmar Bergman nor Kubrick or Orson Welles film could possibly accomplish. Where Bergman made esoteric films that were solely for 'intellectuals', and Kubrick and Welles did films to either impress other directors or annoy audiences Cool Hand Luke speaks in a way wholly it's own. Much like The Seventh Seal (1957) Cool Hand Luke dwells on the meaning of life, and like 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) or Citizen Kane (1941) it focuses on what makes a person human. But unlike those films it doesn't get hooked up on the minutia of existential philosophy that bogs down many spiritual films. It all plays out in a way that is easily digestible for both intellectual and average viewer alike no matter their background. Cool Hand Luke treats death not in a blunt or purely metaphorical way, but in a comforting and understanding way. One of my friends committed suicide last week and the questions of ""why"" and ""how could this happen"" have been in my mind every second since then. This movie was a cathartic experience that did nothing but bring comfort to a mourner.",

Newman is brilliant as the main character from beginning to end as the reluctant hero. I also loved the ""man with no eyes"" character.

151,18 August 2007,sherismedia,10, Absolutely my favorite movie,"This movie is so full of symbolism and is a literary genius. Many people who watch this movie at face value simply seeing Luke as just some guy who went to prison (chain gang) and would not conform do not get this movie at all. I've read many comments on IMDb about this movie and even those who really liked it do not hint on the meaning of this movie. Luke goes to prison for a simple crime of destroying government property by cutting heads off of parking meters in a drunken stoop. He truly cares less about life in general demonstrated by what he did in the war. In the war he earns medals that he downplays which relates directly to the respect he earns of his fellow prisoners. If you saw this as some kind of male bonding movie, then you aren't looking far enough into it. Consider that Luke eats 50 eggs which represents the rebirth of the 50 prisoners there. Eating the eggs bloated him which is what a pregnant woman looks like. You see Luke laying on the table with both arms straight out and one leg folded over the other and he's wearing only white shorts. If you didn't get the Jesus Christ symbolism at that point, then you didn't get the movie. This is NOT male bonding. Luke is emulating Jesus Christ in a rough manner taking their pain into himself. He escaped 3 times not because the author wanted you to see him keep getting caught, but 3 is a prominent number in the bible. For those who questions him dying at the end, it's obvious he dies if you follow that symbolism. He died for them. This movie is such a literary genius that it almost upsets me to even hear it compared to the likes of The Shawshank Redemption, a movie I also like. It doesn't compare. It's unfortunate that so many people do not see the comparable difference of a great literary work to that of another great movie. While the Shawshank Redemption was entertaining, it doesn't have that deep literary content that fills Full Hand Luke. This is why you don't hear great quotes from it like you do Cool Hand Luke. Probably the greatest thing about Cool Hand Luke is we all can relate to wanting to be like that, but most people do not have the nerve to be that strong. That's what makes him different. All the religious symbolism only strengthens this movie into what I feel is the greatest movie ever produced.",

Luke tried to find God but the chains around his legs seemed to tie him down.  His mother visited him in the back of a truck because she was too gravely ill to walk, this scene was very dramatic. George Kennedy,(Dragline),""Bayou Ghost"",'97 had to beat up Luke in a fight that never seemed to end because Luke refused to just lay down on the ground. Kennedy gave a great supporting role to Luke right to the very end of the picture.  Chain Gangs were a very real thing in the 30's and 40's, mostly in the South where I would often see them working in the hot sun and was told by my parents NOT TO FOLLOW IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS!!!",

People say how the mid-60's movies are pretty bad, but this one just proves them that not all the movies in the mid-60's were terrible. My favourite actor is Paul Newman and he always pulls off a great performance. I'm not sure if George Kennedy deserved an Oscar for this, but I'm absolutely certain Paul Newman did (even though he didn't win it). Luke is one of the greatest characters of all time; he never gives up!! I love the scene where he eats 50 eggs in one hour, that was incredible, I can barely eat 2 eggs in one hour!! I'm a girl but that car wash scene was so funny and agonizing at the same time, I could feel their pain!

162,1 February 2012,matthewmarshall,8, Can definiely relate to newman,"One of the reasons that the late 60s/early 70s was such a powerful era in filmmaking is the emergence of the anti-hero (defined as an individual with heroic qualities, but not in a position we would usually find a hero). This is symbolized greatly in 'Cool Hand Luke'. We can identify with Luke because his crime is venial and his concerns over the great questions of life are ours. It is because of this and his persuasive charm that the other prisoners (played remarkably well by Kennedy and a host of others to include Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Dennis Hopper and one of the actors who played a crewmember on 'Alien') live vicariously through him.",

Many of us who lived through the sixties (I actually live near Woodstock, NY) can see part of ourselves in Paul Newman's archetypal antihero, but the character is eternal--the individual against the system, against authority, against political correctness. The Christian imagery reflects director Stuart Rosenberg's sixties interpretation of Christ, one which is open to reflection. I also see parallels between Kafka's The Castle, in which the individual is squelched by faceless bureaucrats who fail to communicate. I was thinking about how I can integrate this classic into the business class I teach, which includes discussions of conformity and communication. Strother Martin's classic line can be integrated into a discussion of the importance of communication and its relevance to power and conformity. The ensemble cast blew me away. I spent several hours figuring out where I've seen the various actors before--Dean Stanton in Big Love, for instance. What a movie! The carefully crafted plot and Rosenberg's meticulous, artistic direction make this a true work of art on a level that is rarely duplicated in the post-millennial world of instantaneous gratification.",

As the audience, we feel like we know every individual man who ends up in the prison, and the many bonding scenes create a warm feeling of camaraderie. However, these scenes were too long and were in need of some serious trimming. Watching this film got repetitive as we were bombarded with the same information over and over - the wardens are cruel, the labour is harsh and the inmates are really good men underneath it all. The technical aspects of this film were actually behind the times and felt disappointingly low-budget which was sometimes distracting. By the end, the film picks up pace and we are treated to more about Luke's backstory and escape attempts which makes up for the rest of the film's plodding timeline.

There were no reviews, nothing in the papers or anywhere else because the movies were so new. All I had to go on was Paul Newman's name. I was mesmerized by the acting, script and production values of this film. The film taught me a number of things I used in my military experience i.e. 1) importance of comradeship 2) being able to stand up for ones self and 3) being a nonconformist when it counts. Newman was ex Navy and he devoted a good portion of his time and money helping veterans. He was also of course a very charitable man (all ""Newmans Own"" profits go to charities) and an accomplished race car driver. I have only a few of his movies missing from my DVD collection and I never tire or get bored watching his movies. Cool Hand Luke is one I've watched at least once a year for the last 10 years.

The film seems to show, if compared to today, a republican point of view, shown by the great Strother Martin and his cronies, versus a democratic point of view, shown by the chain gang inmates, who fight and resist at first but ultimately come together through egg eating contests and never ratting each other out. even race relations were fostered, as Luke stopped off at a black family home to knock off his chains, a clear reference to the opposite of the way things used to be and the good nature of blacks, who could have easily been mad and turned him in.

This was a movie about a rural chain gang prisoners and how he and his buddies passed time. Sure, Luke was a hero, but not the model of resistance that he truly was revealed to be in little of the next couple of years. Today, Lucas Jackson is still the coolest, far cooler then Dean, Travolta, or Cruise. No character since has personified ""cool"". He makes DeNiro look like high school! Luke was fearless because we was right, not to mention very righteous, because he knew he was going to die someday, and he didn't exist simply to justify being alive.

The plot revolves around a petty criminal named Luke who lands himself in a Florida prison and on the chain gang for two years. He is monitored by one of the most sadistic wardens ever portrayed who is called Captain and guards who aren't much better. At first Luke is not very welcomed by the other inmates however that changes once they see what he's made of. Luke continues to rebel against authority and repeatedly tries to escape. He also gains the inmates respect and admiration with his antics and unbreakable will. The plot is realistic, clever, funny, violent, ingenious, captivating and has a cathartic ending. The character Luke remains an icon to rebels everywhere. There are so many memorable scenes in this film. My favorite is the egg bet which challenges Luke to eat 50 hard boiled eggs in one hour. To this day you'll hear fans of this film quote famous lines such as, "" What we've got here is failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach"". In this viewer's opinion that quote sums up the main theme which is although Luke is viewed as a criminal and rebel it is actually authority that is in question, should be challenged and is the antagonist in the film.

188,10 July 2007,stiffcookie33,9," ""He's a natural born world shaker""","With Stuart Rosenberg's COOL HAND Luke in 1967, Paul Newman completed a series of five films, including THE HUSTLER(1961) by Robert Rossen, in which he provided audiences with an extraordinary hero/anti-hero unparalleled (bar Marlon Brando) in cinema history. As Luke, the former war hero turned social misfit imprisoned for chopping the heads off parking meters despite claims he has ""a score to settle"", Newman gives a striking and unforgettable image of a man that just won't lie down, no matter what treatment he endures. Whether it be the seemingly endless torture by the guards, treating him as a dog in order to discipline him after his second escape attempt, or the stomach-churning scene in which he upholds his bet to eat 50 eggs in the space of one hour, Luke always proves his doubters wrong and grows to become a hero for the others prisoners. His bravery, ""more guts than brains"" as states the incarcerated lawyer, and downright stubbornness leads all the others, even the ultimately naive tough guy Dragline (played by George Kennedy in an Oscar winning role), to silently worship him as their hero...the guy standing up for the things their cowardice won't allow them too. Newman's role became iconic, and this is down to some legendary scenes that have turned this movie into an all-time great. For instance, the Saturday afternoon fight scene with Dragline, in which Luke just won't ""stay down"" despite the barrage of punches coming his way, concluded by him muttering: ""to keep me down, you gonna have to kill me!"". Or the scene where Luke is able to push the other members of the chain gang to work at twice the speed, thus giving them more free-time and puzzling the guards. The film is also filled with memorable one-liners, such as: ""What we have here, is failure to communicate."" This in a way sums up the entire film, Luke is a rebel, someone who won't be repressed by the rules set down, whether it be those of the guards or of his inmates. His incarceration is due to his nonacceptance of the rules set down in the outside world, his reason for his crime being that it was ""a small town, not much to do in the evening"". But the world to which he is introduced represents many more ""limits"" which, every time he breaks, imposes increased and harsher punishment. He pushes the Captain, played with a peaceful but easily ignited rage by Strother Martin, into demonstrating to the full extent his ""mean son-of-a-bitch"" side, whose wrath parallels Luke's vision of the ""Old Man"" up above who sees him solely as a ""hard case"".As he says, ""You've got to admit, You ain't dealt me no cards in a long time"". The spectator may or may not like his character, but what's sure is that definitely dosen't give a damn whether we do or don't. And that's what makes COOL HAND Luke such a powerful movie.""You run one time, you got yourself a set of chains. You run twice you got yourself two sets. You ain't gonna need no third set, 'cause you gonna get your mind right"", the other characters, the other members of society are doomed never to comprehend him, leading to his actions being completely unpredictable. But as he says himself, ""I never made a plan in my life"". The movie may not be beautifully filmed or as exciting as other prison escape movies such as Steve McQueen's THE GREAT ESCAPE and PAPILLON, but that is not its point. COOL HAND Luke represents a cultural and historical milestone, with Newman's performance up their with the very, very best. 18/20",

This is a great Paul Newman vehicle in one his his most memorable roles. He was nominated for the Academy award for Best Actor as Cool Hand Luke for 1967 but lost out to Rod Stieger in a field that also included Spencer Tracy, Warren Beaty and Dustin Hoffman. The film received three other nominations for Supporting Actor which George Kennedy won, and for Screenplay from Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson adapted from Pearce's novel and Original Music Score from Lalo Shifrin. Novelist Pearce had himself one been a chain gang convict which inspired his story. It would be his first and only screenplay for a theatrical release. Director Stuart Rosenberg would go on to direct Newman in a couple more movies had just made the leap from television director to the big screen with Cool Hand Luke as his first theatrical feature. Rosenberg would enjoy continued success with Brubaker, The Drowing Pool, the April Fools and The Amityville Horror. Kennedy won the Supporting Actor Oscar but more people probably remember the remarkable performance by Strother Martin. Cast members also include Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton, Wayne rogers, Ralph Waite and Joe Donn Baker. Cool Hand Luke thumbs it's nose at conformity, establishment and oppression which made it very popular in 1967 with audiences.

I can see why his fellow prisoners seeing Luke as cool and aspire to be like and admire him. Newman does give a solid, interesting and enjoyable performance. I think Kennedy creates an equally important and realistic character as Luke's lead admirer type and champion, equal in importance to the story as Luke's character. Is Luke really a wronged, non-conformist hero to be admired and someone others can learn from about how to go through life? Absolutely not. However, he and Kennedy do represent two of life's types, and even though this film is not the great film some espouse it is still worth checking out.",

There are still some of the old buildings from that prison work camp still standing on Hwy 19 just south of Tavares, Fl. From what I have been told from some older people in the area, the movie is pretty close to the actual environment at this prison camp.

196,26 May 2003,esteban1747,8, Hard Man Luke,"This is probably the best film ever played by the extraordinary actor Paul Newman. Nearly the whole film is played in a prison in a rural area, where the prisoners have their ways of living, and obviously a kind of boss among them (Dragline= George Kennedy), but once Luke is placed in prison, his way of resisting anything around him attracted the sympathy from many of his colleagues. He was never afraid of anything, he did not know why he was living in this life, and he had serious doubt about the existence of God. Probably he had a heavy childhood although he loved his mother very seriously. Prison in many parts of the world, not to say everywhere, instead of being a place for educating persons, it is just a place for punishment without any mercy. Many of the prisoners due to this was of living normally become more dangerous than in the past. This film shows an injustice, Luke's mother died, and the bosses of the prison put Luke in a hole just to avoid him to escape, So where is the logic? the man did not do anything wrong and is punished. Obviously, Luke became a hard rebel and escaped anytime he could. At the end of the film, there is an interesting scene when he tried to talk with God, whom he called the Old man.

He is sentenced to a labor prison where the inmates work in sweltering heat to clear vegetation and help pave roads. The prison warden, known as Captain (Stother Martin), reads from Luke's records that the new prisoner is a war hero with no prior arrests, making him an outsider among outsiders. But even if he had more in common with the other prisoners, Luke's style is to maintain his individuality rather than to try to fit in. Showing no signs of fear or of quitting whether he goes up against other inmates, the bosses or even inner conflicts, Luke is most inspirational when he is at odds with the working order. He consistently chooses the hard road, taking knockout blows again and again in a fistfight with the much bigger Dragline instead of accepting defeat by simply staying down. Or pushing himself and the other prisoners to work an entire road in just a fraction of the time it normally takes. Or betting the prisoners that he can eat 50 eggs in one hour. Lukeï¿½s free spirit leads him to continually push the envelope, eventually manifesting in dangerous escape attempts now on upgrade Native 4K and Dolby Vision coming soon on Warner Bros 4k ultra hd release July 2021",

The movie stars Paul Newman as Luke a man who refuses to conform to prison life, this movie goes on a par with some of the best prison movies ever made such as Birdman of Alcatraz, The Green Mile, and The Shawshank Redemption. This movie is not only great it also has a huge emotional impact because when Newman's mother dies the guards wouldn't even let him go to the funeral, including the scene where he talked to his mother for the very last time. This would probably be the most emotional prison movie I have seen in my entire life. No one would have played the character of Luke Jackson better than Paul Newman in one of his career defining performances. There was a lot of other good performances especially from George Kennedy in a great supporting performance, including a young Dennis Hopper in an excellent portrayal.

And man, oh, man, is it a powerful film. I recently revisited it, as much for kicks as anything else, and I was surprised at how much I had missed when I first saw it. This film is heralded as a nonconformist film and a social commentary. Well, it may be a social commentary, but calling it a nonconformist film is like calling the Hope Diamond just a gem. It is so much more. Luke is a stubborn guy, and when he's shot at the end, it's affecting. But Luke isn't the type of guy who is stubborn to be a nuisance, it's just how he is; he can't help it. He became a hero to the men, compromising their own dreams of freedom just to get a glimpse of Luke's, but he never chose to be. He partakes in horrible acts of self-destruction, like eating fifty hard-boiled eggs in one hour or boxing against the makeshift leader of the men, and his does so willingly, until he's battered and broken beyond repair. The film is about what it takes to break a man. The psychological and physical torture put upon him by the guards cause him to question himself, and then God for having made him as he is. When he runs to an old church and asks God what to do with the hand he's been dealt is a haunting and indelible piece of cinema, from his soliloquy to his death. It's unforgettable. George Kennedy plays the leader of the prisoners, and a friend of Luke's. His character is deep and complex, not as strong as he lets on, nor does he understand Luke, but he is a wonderful character and a good man. This film is more bleak than other social commentaries, like ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" a decade later, but Paul Newman as Luke is a more likable, sympathetic character in a significantly worse situation. Nobody else could have pulled off a role like Luke.",

He had starred in movies like Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The Hustler, Hud, Butch Cassidy, The Sting, The Verdict and Cool Hand Luke (all of them Oscar performances). In Cool Hand Luke..Newman gives an outstanding performance as the laconic ""anti hero"" who really doesn't like anyone ....particularly those in Authority. He ends up in prison where..eventually he becomes a hero to his inmates. Luke knows they are intimidated by the villainous Warden (brilliantly played by Strother Martin) and that means he cant be friends with any of them. Luke shows no fear....and continually aggravates the hard--line Warden. There have been many parallels drawn about the Vietnam war Etc. Etc. , and his close resemblance (in behavior) to Jesus Christ. Luke sees defeat in the eyes of his fellow chain gang members..a willingness to toe the line. That is not the Cool Hand Luke way, so he goes it alone. It has to end in tragedy (this is Hollywood !!), and it does.....after the Cool One takes us on a wild and emotional ride. Stuart Rosenberg directs this wonderfully.

The other interesting thing about this movie, is the most memorable scene with the hot blonde woman played by Joy Harmon...in my memory, she really grinds herself into that car's window while wet and soapy for awhile, on further review, the scene only lasts about three seconds!!! I think they should probably do a remake and extend that scene and play some really great hot and heavy music, or maybe somebody should just make a cool music video with the scene and play it in slow motion for the greatest effect!!! But over all this movie stands up to time and I am actually amazed that they haven't done a remake with Denzel Washington or Will Smith playing Paul Newman's part and Forest Whitaker playing the big dudes part...",

The film is almost a Biblical tale of the last years of Jesus Christ's ministry from the New Testament. I can't divulge any details as it ruins the film's plot.

An unhappy yet realistic ending , much like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid. One cannot stop hoping it is a happy ending.

The prisoners before the arrival of Luke are not united and have lost all the fighting spirit within them.

If he does survive, is his survival merely wishful thinking on the part of his fellow inmates? Note that the film's final image is a brief shot of a photograph. It was established in an earlier sequence that this idyllic photograph represents a lie. We also know that the photograph's image was staged and that the photograph itself was torn to shreds earlier in the film.

I am glad it wasn't because I suspect that vested interests would have messed with it in one way or another for commercial reasons. Thankfully it was made when it was and the cast and crew deserve a collective congratulations on a job really well done. I have met people like Luke in my life on a few occasions and although I briefly warmed to their respective personalities I was also aware that they were not destined to be be around very long for at least one reason. Luke was a square peg trying to fit into a round hole and no matter how hard he and they tried he and they never actually make it work. In another country at another time he may have survived but not in this state and not at this time. Whatever it was that Luke wanted he was never going to get it because the people who ultimately had the control in this case a prison but it could easily have been out on the streets, were not going to relinquish that control for nobody or nothing. I understand that rehabilitation can be a wonderful thing but I suspect that the word was not in the forefront of the training if there was any for a job in that prison. If you were strong enough and intelligent enough to survive the heat, the monotonous work, the beatings and even the mind numbing boredom then I suppose you would leave at the end of your sentence and try and get out of that state as fast as possible. If you weren't strong enough you perished and ended up in an unmarked grave. For all his strength of character and trying to 'live life free and above board' Luke doesn't make it and fortunately the film is a lot more than just about how and why he fails to survive. Some square pegs eventually fit into round holes with luck and support from family and or friends, Luke had none of these and although his defiance was admired by the other inmates the guards broke him and eventually killed him. For me it was just over two hours well spent watching a very good film and I would recommend anyone watch it.",

Luke's prison buddy, Dragline, played by George Kennedy, rides Luke's coattails like a fumbling, bumbling idiot. I believe he actually won a Academy Award for this part, when the true star of the movie was Paul Newman.  Many scenes and characters from the movie are still vivid. The ""man with no eyes"", who plays a shotgun toting guard, the chase scene where the blood hounds run themselves to death trying to catch Luke. And Strother Martin is memorable as the warden, especially when he utters the famous line to Luke, ""Now, what we have here is a failure to communicate.""

He plays a bored guy in a small town who gets drunk and cuts the heads off of parking meters. This lands him in jail where we spend the rest of the movie watching him (as Luke) and his fellow inmates. George Kennedy turns in the performance of his career as a fellow inmate who takes his time warming up to the headstrong Luke.,

255,11 December 2021,jandrfilms,8, Cool Hand Luke was,"Cool hand Luke was a pretty good movie.

256,21 March 2009,jonoabde,8, A Real Cool Hand,"Cool Hand Luke retells the archetypal struggle of hope in the face of adversity. It tells of defiance in the face of overwhelming pressure to conform. It presents to us an injudicious judicial system, whose wanton brutality and heartlessness confronts the audience. Vicariousness (which we all to some degree can identify with) is examined, in the most depressing of circumstances, namely, imprisonment. Much meaning is conveyed throughout the film and the film's overall message remains as relevant today as it did when the film was made. Luke says in the film, 'sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand.' That, in a sentence, embodies what Cool Hand Luke is about. The director is trying to say that there can be victory, regardless of circumstance and that hope, persistence and optimism can prevail against all. It is Luke's hope that keeps his smile on his face; it is hope that typifies him as a hero to his inmates, it is hope that continues to fuel his escape attempts and, above all, it is hope that keeps his spirit free. It was Thomas Carlyle who said, 'he who has hope, has everything.' The truth of these words is personified in Luke. An air of invulnerability surrounds Luke throughout the film and it is hope that acts as his protection. Even on the doorstep of death, Luke is seen smiling. From beyond the grave Luke tells those who lived vicariously through him 'keep Hope alive.' It is also this that the director is telling us. Ultimately, Cool Hand Luke tells us that freedom of spirit is of far greater importance than that of the body. It is a reminder to us; we who are 'free' to ensure that we do indeed, lead truly free lives. That we should not live our lives in a vain effort to conform to our bureaucratic systems but rather, live our lives in the way they ought to be lived. The director is telling us to be free and to hope and it is that that Cool Hand Luke so skilfully imparts to us.",
257,20 May 2000,Dante Hicks,8, Cool Sunglasses,Small town misfit Lucas Jackson ends up in a road prison for 'criminal damage against municipal property'. Despite the rather unusual crime he committed and his standoffish attitude he eventually gains the respect of prisoner and guard alike. This is a neat little film which showcases Newman's undoubted talent. His excellent performance as the non-conformist 'Cool Hand' Luke lends much to a film which has been eclipsed repeatedly as best prison movie. What the film lacks in the depth of it's characters it makes up for in audience feeling towards Luke and his desire to find his place in society yet not change his ways. You can't help but love his stubborn arrogance as he goes up against the system and many of the films ideas can be found in better and deeper movies like 'The Shawshank Redemption'. It's sad to think that it is better remembered for the egg-eating scene than for it's symbolism and regard to those who choose to live as social drifters.,

The movie was very well made, well acted, and well casted.  I couldn't see anyone else as accurately playing the parts in the movie, except maybe Denzel Washington if they made a new version of the film where Luke was black, because Paul Newman is old now, and he's not even black. Anyhow, not only was the movie awesome and very well made, it was made from a novel.  They say that books are hard to turn into movies (watch ""Sphere"" to see for yourself {the book ""Sphere"" was good but the motion picture sucks!}) and that you have to start from scratch when moviemaking- obviously not with Cool Hand Luke.  Luke is copied for heroes in many other movies, books, and even video games (Metal Gear Solid), as is the mysterious warden (""Holes"").  Cool Hand Luke is a movie about a man arrested for something he did while intoxicated, then makes every effort to escape a labor camp. Special appearance by Dennis Hopper when he was young.

They are disappointed when Luke demonstrates the obedience while they are obedient, asking him to be courage eventhough they think , ""give someone their limits to the bosses"", but still maintaining the same passive position. Within this mechanism, Luke's dignity has a symbolic significance both outside the world of the oppressed and the oppressor, and is a feature that they both politicize from different angles and use them for their own purposes. Being irrational and Luke's lack of intelligence drives him to death.",

271,26 October 2000,mse1576,8, Acting and Direction are tremendous,"Paul Newman played the quintessential loner who tries to buck the system. He underplays the role to the point of perfection. He's not only a loner to his cell mates, but also to the audience. Strother Martin is excellent as the Captain, while he sounds rather tame is actually brutal. Its a little melodramatic, but it ultimately is about the result of alienation. Great if you are in a rebellious mood.",

The Park Theater in Gardena, CA was the world's most expensive movie theater...50 cents to get in and 50 dollars for new clothes! Back to the movie...this was one of the best movies of its type and its year. Paul Newman gave one of his greatest performances (Oscar nomination) and had one of the best supporting casts of any movie of any kind. George Kennedy won his Oscar after years of journeyman work; Oscar winner Jo Van Fleet gave a great cameo performance as Luke's mom; and that ensemble of fellow prisoners and prison officials...?! Just watch the movie, pause at intervals and look at that cast (Wayne Rogers, Joe Don Baker, Harry Dean Stanton, Strother Martin, on and on and on). Great scenes and/or quotes (who can forget the floor walker explaining what will get someone ""a night in the box,"" the girl washing the car, the egg eating challenge or the warden's legendary statement to Luke toward the end of the movie, etc., etc.). The IMDb section on Goofs said this movie showed 60s era money when it was set in another era...??!!... this movie, from all indications, was set in the 60s. Leonard Maltin said in his book of movie reviews that this film shows that ""chain gangs haven't changed much since Paul Muni was on a chain gang."" Amen.

Don't let the low profile mislead you - 'Cool Hand Luke' might be one of the most influential movies of the 60's. Great script, one I'm sure the Coen Brothers would bear witness to.

A transformation that morphed the male ideal to one of feminine beauty. But in between the laconic, rugged individualist (Gary Cooper, Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne) and the cute, physically non-threatening boy toy (David Cassidy, Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger) was the charismatic outsider (Marlon Brando, James Dean, Paul Newman): beguiling yet dangerous, clean cut yet anti-authoritarian--refusing to give in to the societal polemic that demanded conformity.

An American classic, Cool Hand Luke (1967) is as much a product of its time as any important movie ever made. CHL marks the beginning of the end of the cycle of American movies about rebels standing up to authority. In many ways it is the apotheosis of such movies, providing in one fell swoop both one of the most appealing of the rebels, while at the same time fundamentally questioning whether the ""establishment"" is at all vulnerable to rebellion. It is, at its core, a pessimistic film... pessimistic about the possibility of justice, of reform, and of individualism. In the end Luke dies for his sins, and to an outside observer, his reification as a folk legend among a small band of convicts seems like a hollow victory at best.

But he's paying the price for a drunken jag resulting in some damaged parking meters, and without trying, ingratiates himself with fellow prisoners following a physical beating at the hands of fellow prisoner Dragline (George Kennedy). That confrontation sets up the story for Luke's repeated attempts at escaping not only from the work farm, but from his own restless sense of being a prisoner in his own skin.

How it missed out on Best Picture, Best Director and Best Cimenatography is amazing. There are so many great camera shots. The one that stands out the most is after the ""Walking Boss"", ""the man with no eyes"", as Kennedy's character says, shoots the snake Luke is holding up in his hand. The camera moves to a close-up of the Boss' mirrored sun glasses and we can see and hear Luke talking in them. The religious symbolisms are many. Just to name a few; Luke spread out just like Jeasus after easting the eggs, the scene when Luke talks to God in the bad storm and even the way the roads form crosses.",
308,3 November 2000,agregor1,10, Fantastic.,"Imagine Shawshank Redemption of the 1960's on a chain gang.  But funnier.  Really uplifting tale about how the human spirit will stand strong.  Strothers Martin, my man Paul Newman, and George Kennedy all put in great showings.  Good music too.   Its a close race, but I would have to say that this is my favorite movie of all time.",
309,25 April 2003,Blink18teetoo,10, one of the greatest movies ever!,"Great acting, great story, & a great period in American history; when you didn't have to worry about being stabbed or raped in Prison, but be cheated in a friendly poker game.  Honestly, the only movie I've ever seen with Paul, but something tells me it's his best because it can't get much better than this movie.  I would say it is up there with One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Bravo.",
310,28 August 2003,izzy45,10," ""What we have here is a failure to communicate...""","Paul Newman had said that this was one of the best scripts he has ever read. ""Cool Hand Luke"" is about a man who is arrested and put into a chain gang for cutting of the heads of parking meters while drunk. The movie takes place in the chain gang and is about how Luke (Newman) deals with his life. The acting in this movie is excellent. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I recommend you go see it.",
311,8 June 2005,ohio_state_buckeyes1,10, A great movie,"I watched Cool Hand Luke as part of my Existential philosophy class I was taking this past spring. While I had heard of the movie, I never took the time to watch it before this class. What a great movie with a lot of symbolism. I watched this movie and immediately saw the character of Luke as Freidrich Nietzsche might have seen him, an overman type that had come as close as maybe anyone to using his own ""will to power"" if you will. While I am a fan of Nietzsche, I also saw other points of other philosophers as well, even Nietzsche's opposite Kierkegaard and others like Heidegger and Camus. Maybe this movie was intended to be philosophical and maybe it wasn't, but I enjoyed it either way and recommend it to anyone regardless of their feelings of life or philosophy.",
312,28 July 2003,angmiller80,10, The Best Movie Ever,"Cool Hand Luke has something for everyone, Action, Drama whatever you like. If you have never seen this movie, you need to watch it. The only question I have about this movie is how many eggs did he have to eat for this movie. I love this movie I give it 20 thumbs up.",
313,24 September 2003,vladamirswartzkopf,10, Definitely Paul Newman's best film.,"In this classic film Paul Newman gives his best performance ever in a film (although the Academy Awards failed to think so). While I'm upset at the Academy Awards snubbing Newman's performance, 1967 would've been a hard year to choose a winner (Rod Steiger in In the Heat of the Night, Spencer Tracey in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, Dustin Hoffman in The Graduate, and the icing on the cake, Warren Beatty in Bonnie and Clyde). All the performances were Oscars caliber, and I guess they couldn't have a five way tie....but Rod Steiger? Oh, well, that was many many years ago. Newman's performance finally got some attention this summer as his character of Lucas Jackson appeared on the list of the top 50 heroes of the movies of the last 100 years. It made me very happy seeing as AFI failed to list the film in the top 100 movies. But your favorite film can't win everything I guess. If you're a Paul Newman fan definitely check this one out, you won't be disappointed. If you don't check it out you're a ""Failure to Communicate.""",
314,1 April 2004,gshivers,10, Watch it again,"This movie has everything anybody could ever ask for.  Paul Newman gives the performance of his life as Luke the ""nonconformist.""  I'm a college student and this movie was past my time, or so I thought.  this movie made such an impact on me that i instantly wanted to see some of the older movies that i neglected because of the year they came out(i used to hate old movies). My dad knew how much i like movies (especially new ones), and suggested I see this one. Sure I thought, i'll take one for the team because he wants me to see it. I thought it was going to be another boring old movie, but I couldnt have been more wrong.  this movie works in so many ways.  all i can say is that u need to watch it, then watch it again.  and once you've done that, watch it again.",
315,14 October 1998,andy-148,10, Great movie,"This movie is the greatest movie of the 60's and one of the greatest movies of all time.  The cinematography is wonderful, and the acting is great too! I just love this movie!  Probably a bias",
316,30 May 2000,grayharrison,10, The God-darn coolest film ever made!,"This has to be regarded as one of the best American films ever made. This cool, slick and stylish prison drama has George Kennedy in an award winning role while Paul Newman in an Oscar nominated (should have won) role for playing Luke. With an amazing supporting cast and a host of memorable moments, this is one of those films you can watch over and over again. Also I've read an article which mentioned the similarities between the plot of Cool Hand Luke and One flew over the cuckoo's nest which I would have to say is alike, what do you",
317,30 June 2008,qasim-beatlesrock,10, Cool Hand Luke and Existenialism.,"Existentialism has been part of literature and movies ever since it was popularized by the likes of Jean-Paul Sartre and other French Philosophers.I've seen many movies which can be interpreted as having existentialist or postmodernist (Nihilistic) tendencies. I myself can't stand movies having nihilistic themes such as 'Pulp Fiction',although these movies have been quite a success at the big screen and no body feels reluctant to call them 'Blockbuster'. Existentialism on the other hand is not as hopeless a philosophy (If you consider it a philosophy) as Nihilism.Existentialism in a nutshell is philosophy 'individualized'.Its emphasis on human freedom and liberty is such that it has attracted many creative writers and film makers.The influence of existentialism spreads beyond the realm of philosophy. 'Cool Hand Luke',staring one of my favorite actors Paul Newman stands up as a movie which can surely belong to existential genre.The movie surrounds around one man's defiance against authority .The protagonist from start of the movie till its end ,struggles to get himself free.The problem with the most of the people is that they give up pretty quickly but the problem with our hero is that he never gives up.He can be described as a person who consciously makes all those efforts to get himself free,but is unconsciously aware about his futile efforts.Any person who have special affinity towards 'Existentialism' must see this masterpiece.Had Sartre reviewed this movie he would only have used one sentence to end it all,the sentence would surely have been ,'Man is condemned to be free'.But I will end my review with the tag line of the movie,'What we've got here is a failure to communicate'.",
318,6 September 2019,ls_coop,10, Best movie I have ever seen.,It is a great movie my favorite in fact. The story is a man serving time for destruction of public property and has to serve 2 years in jail. And he becomes desperate and tries to escape. Watch this movie it's worth it.,
