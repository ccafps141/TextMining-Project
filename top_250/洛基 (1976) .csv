0,2 January 2010,classicsoncall,10," ""He doesn't know it's a show. He thinks it's a damn fight!""","One gains a certain degree of perspective with the passage of time, and one of the things I like to do is watch a movie that I saw upon it's original release and compare my feelings for it now to those I experienced back in the day. I thought ""Rocky"" was a great and inspiring movie back in 1976, and with only the slightest bit of hesitation, I think it delivers the same feelings today. I throw in that slight hesitation part because over the years, the sports underdog theme has been worked to death in cinema. But the thing about ""Rocky"" is that it's not so much a film about boxing as it is a film about life in general. A direction-less man with no goals suddenly finds the gold ring handed to him on a platter. Not that there isn't a whole lot of work involved to make that dream come true, but one has to recognize opportunity in the first place. I read with some amusement the negative reviews of the picture on this board and have to wonder how many of the nay-sayers consider themselves so intellectually superior that they trash the film for that simple lack of recognition. Because criticizing Rocky Balboa for talking like he had a mouth full of marbles is missing the point. He talked like that because he was a street punk working as an enforcer for a local mob boss, and the people he dealt with on a daily basis weren't exactly magna cum laude types. Nor was he going up against members of mensa whenever he climbed through the ring ropes at a local boxing joint.",/
1,24 February 2016,BA_Harrison,10, Yo!,"Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a struggling Italian/American boxer who also earns cash collecting debts for shady Philadelphian 'businessman' Gazzo (Joe Spinell).

2,6 July 2015,utgard14,10," ""I ain't no bum, Mick. I ain't no bum.""","A first-rate film that's about as close to perfect as any movie about boxing (or any other sport) that I've ever seen. The plot is very simple -- small-time boxer Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is given a chance to fight the heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). It sounds no different than a ton of old movies about the sport. But this film proves that it's not always how fresh or unique the story is but how well it's crafted. Rocky is a masterpiece of filmmaking with dynamite acting from Sylvester Stallone, Burgess Meredith, Talia Shire, Burt Young, and Carl Weathers. Many classic scenes, lines, characters. Bill Conti's score is one of the all-time greats. It was nominated for nine Oscars, winning three including Best Picture. It was director John G. Avildsen's best film and many would argue it is Stallone's best as well. Certainly his best screenplay. The fight choreography is terrific. Followed by a string of enjoyable sequels but they were just solid entertainment. This one is very entertaining but it is also something much more than that. It's one of those movies that becomes part of culture in a big way where everybody recognizes something from the film even if they've never seen it.",e

4,3 November 2015,ivo-cobra8,10, A classic! the best and the original movie of all time - Rocky !,"Rocky (1976) It is still today one of the best action, sport, drama and a cult classic low budget films ever made in history. It is an underdog story telling about a men and his struggle in his life. Sure, I know that without it, there'd be no sequels for a ranking, but compared to III, although this Best Picture of 1976 was great, it just dragged a bit for me. I'm no brainless action-goer, mind you. I love real human drama portrayed on screen. I've got to say though, at times, you feel like you're watching a documentary on a real man's life. It's that much realistic. This to me is a no brainier. You get introduced to an insecure Rocky who works for the mob as a collector, but has too big of a heart to go around hurting people in an awesome heartfelt movie. Adrian and Rock meet, You get introduced to the lovable A-hole Pauly. Introduced to Creed. Introduced to Mick. And BUTKUS! And Rock goes the distance with Creed! This movie has a Heart . As a kid Rocky III was my favorite best movie ,but this one is my second best movie. YO ADRIAN I DID IT!!!",i

I remember when I was a kid, I never liked the first Rocky, was too obsessed with III and IV. It happened when I was 11 and I went to see V in the theater. I never been to a movie like that before. People were screaming and cheering. Shook the whole damn place. They were dancing in the isle's and celebrating. It was then I realized the true power of Stallone's vision.

7,11 August 2019,BandSAboutMovies,10, A perfect movie,"Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay for Rocky in three and a half days after watching Chuck Wepner take world champion Muhammad Ali to 15 rounds, a feat that no one saw coming. Stallone was also inspired by two boxers named Rocky - Marciano and Graziano, as well as Joe Frazier.",/
8,18 February 2005,rbverhoef,9, A great Sylvester Stallone film,"If you think Sylvester Stallone has made nothing but stinkers you just have to see 'Rocky'. This is a brilliant film, based on Stallone's own screenplay, where he plays a complex character in such a terrific way it is not strange people thought this was going to be a great actor. Compare it to another great film about a boxer, 'Raging Bull', and 'Rocky' will be better at some points. It goes without saying that it's quite an achievement.",r
9,15 May 2020,marcin_kukuczka,10," The older it gets, the better it is... Wonderful Movie!","It seems that those movie productions that had to fight the big fight with the expectations, somehow, turned out to be timeless, not only for the fans of the genre but for the general audiences as well. That is, undeniably, the case with ROCKY not yet directed by Sylvester Stallone but by late John G Avildsen (who comes back with the direction of ROCKY V in 1990). ROCKY, after all these years and a lot of sequels made after, including the recent CREED films, proves to be one of the very best films about sport, a sportsman and, most importantly, a personality - formerly 'nobody' rising to the top-notch fame and popularity.",w
10,24 December 2015,Uriah43,8, Intense Action and Drama,"""Rocky Balboa"" (Sylvester Stallone) is a boxer who struggles just trying to make ends meets in the city of Philadelphia. Although he certainly isn't the brightest person around he has a big heart and does the best that he can. Yet even then he realizes that he is going nowhere fast. Then one day he gets a call from a man who wants to schedule a fight between him and the undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World who goes by the name ""Apollo Creed"" (Carl Weathers). At first Rocky refuses because he doesn't believe he is in the same class as the World Champion and doesn't deserve the honor. However, he eventually comes around and gets more serious about his training. But even then he has grave doubts about his chances. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a very good movie which really highlights the importance of never giving up and always trying to do your best in spite of the odds. Admittedly, the first hour or so is quite slow but during this time it provides the character development necessary for the intense action and drama in the second hour. This is especially true for Talia Shire (as Rocky's girlfriend ""Adrian"") and the aforementioned Sylvester Stallone. At any rate, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it to those who might be interested in a movie of this type.",0
11,30 March 2013,planktonrules,10," The film cost a million and grossed over 100,000,000 domestically.....'nuff said.","I am not a huge boxing film fan. Well, that's not exactly true. I am not a fan of films that glamorize boxing. Movies like ""The Harder They Fall"", ""Requiem For a Heavyweight"" and ""Champion"" and ""The Set-Up"" are all wonderful films about the brutality and vicious nature of the 'sport' and are great indictments about what a terrible thing boxing is--and I heartily recommend them. However, ""Rocky"" is a rare film that glamorizes boxing (for the most part) and manages to deliver a film that you can't help but admire. Think about it. It was a small film, costing only about a million, and earned TONS of money and won the Best Picture Oscar!! No matter what you think of the later Rocky Films (as they got progressively worse) or the other films of Sylvester Stallone, you cannot take anything away from this tremendous achievement. It is a great film and it's amazing that it was made by folks who no one really heard about up until then. Plus, when you read about how quickly Stallone penned the script, you can't help but admire it. A terrific film.",9
12,9 April 2001,mm-39,9, Stalone's best,"As much as the media mocks Stallone, he won best picture for this film. He will never top this film, which made him a icon.  It's a story about a down on his luck loan collector/ boxers who gets a one time shot at the heavy weight championship, because of a late pull out by a contender, and the champ does not want to lose his money on the deal.  There is romance between Rocky and his new girl friend who lives just as hard of a life as Rocky, and together they make life livable. The rest of the cast is other down and outers who give the viewer a feeling of hopelessness until Rocky gets his chance.  This film is touching, and unforgettable.",6

14,14 May 2000,forsaken999,10, NOT A BOXING MOVIE!,"The first common misconception about Rocky, and something that's almost inevitable when you put a half-naked Stallone with boxing gloves on the cover is that it's a fighting movie.  In that time it would fall into a category including Jean-Claude Van Damme and Jackie Chan.  Now don't get me wrong, I like both of these actors a lot, they're among my favorites, but Rocky is not just another cheap movie about a man who like to win a fight or tournament because he deserves it (Bloodsport, Quest).  Instead of a fighting movie we should say that it is a movie about a fighter.  That changes the context altogether, it means that sure he has fighting on his mind but has other personal issues that are demonstrated throughout the movie.  In fact in the whole movie there are two fight scenes (at the beginning and at the end) which together add up to about 15 minutes.",6

Although the latest efforts of Stallone have been pitiful, the movie that made his career is the 1977 Academy Award Winner for Best Picture, `Rocky'. On top of that, `Rocky' also earned two more Academy Awards for Best Film-Editing and Best Director (John G. Avildsen).",5

19,20 December 2016,Hitchcoc,10, What's Not to Like,"Rocky is the consummate boxing movie. But it's also the story of a man who had pretty much wasted his life. Sylvester Stallone's boxer has thick head and a good heart. He depends on other to kind of look out for him. Unfortunately, he has worked with crooks because it's the only living he knows. He does hard manual labor. He likes to box and because he is intense, he catches the eye of the world champion. He gets a gig as a sparring partner and eventually a fight with the champ, Apollo Creed. Of course, it's a circus. Because Rocky is not bright, Creed is able to abuse him emotionally. Rocky is a bruiser, taking as many hits as he gives. Not a good way to have a future. There are subplots, involving MIck (Burgess Meredith) and Pauley (who is disrespectful of his sister Adrian) and then there is the romance developing between Rocky and Adrian. What happens is that Creed thinks Rocky is a joke while Rocky begins to train seriously for the first time in his life. What eventually happens is one of the best choreographed fights in all of cinematic history. A masterful movie.",r

It's okay. It was needed to give us character studies of the main players: Rocky, his wife, his brother, his manager, etc., people we would see in subsequent films. Also, the fight scenes in those sequels went on too long, anyway. Frankly, I've enjoyed all the Rocky movies, beginning with this one.",e

22,4 March 2002,b_u_n_44,10, The fact that Rocky isn't on the top 250 is kinda sad.,"Rocky is one of two great boxing movies. Only Raging Bull challenges Rocky as the greatest boxing movie of all time. Not only is there great action inside the ring, the story and drama outside the ring makes for a movie worth watching over and over again. There is no doubt in my mind it should be at least in the top 25.",_
23,21 July 2009,kosmasp,9, Underdog,"The making of the movie, seems to mirror the movie itself. As much as Sylvester Stallone struggled to make the movie, as much is his character Rocky in a struggle in life. And that's what makes the movie so great. The boxing reflects the life of it's characters. And Sly believed in this movie, which is why he wanted to star in it too. His choices were right.",=
24,26 February 2003,Obi-Wan Wilson,10, One of the greatest movies of all time.,"I don't remember exactly when I first saw this film, but for a long time I thought that the second of the series was my favorite.  Well, I recently bought the DVD box-set and after I watched the first movie again I knew that it was definitely the best in the series, and also one of the best movies ever made.  Rocky is very much more than just a boxing movie.  It's a movie about the unbreakable human spirit, determination, and the will to ""go the distance.""  Rocky(Sylvester Stallone) is a second rate club-fighter and a debt collector for a loan shark(Joe Spinnell).  He becomes involved with a shy girl working in a petshop named Adrian(Talia Shire), and also becomes friends with her brother Paulie(Burt Young).  Rocky's life really isn't anything of interest - until the World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) gives him an unexpected shot at the title.  An old boxer-turned-trainer named Mick(Burgess Meredith) offers to be Rocky's manager.  Although the whole film is outstanding, what follows are some of the greatest and most memorable movie moments of all time.  Rocky striving to go the distance in the training scene, the final fight, and the closing moments of the film are so emotional and inspiring that they perfectly demonstrate the human spirit and can bring out the will to win in anybody. Add to this an excellent music score and you have  a classic and unforgettable movie.  Without a doubt deserved the Best Picture award in 1976.   Exceptional performances by all the cast members, notably Burgess Meredith and Sylvester Stallone.  **** out of ****",t
25,8 December 2018,josephellis,7, More than a boxing movie,"This film is very different than the sequels. It's more of a Drama that explains Balboa's early life. It's cool to revisit, seeing him before his success. For those who just want boxing, you won't get too much of it. It focuses on the drama and character buildups more than action. You still have to watch this before you watch the others.",t
26,19 July 2017,ironhorse_iv,9, What a knockout! This underdog boxing film was amazing! It went the distance!,"Opening with a black screen, following by giant white letters, the word, 'Rocky' scrolls across from right to left, accompanied by the iconic theme song 'Gonna Fly Now' from composer, Bill Conti ; this Bi-Centennial sport film, tells the story of a down on his luck, boxer, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) on his quest to achieve success in the boxing world, by accepting, the role of replacement opponent for world champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) in an exhibition match in Philadelphia, PA. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while many of film historians & critics, labelled this, as the 'greatest boxing movie of all time'; in truth, this film directed by John G. Avildsen has little fighting in it. When it did, the punches look a bit fake and hokey, despite Stallone and Weathers suffered injuries during the shooting of the final fight; with Stallone suffered bruised ribs and Weathers suffered a damaged nose. Nevertheless, the fight scenes are not really, the heart of the movie. Instead, this film written by Sylvester Stallone works best, when focuses mostly on the titular character, trying to seek the love of a mousy pet store employee, Adrian Pennino (Talia Shire), by proving his own self-worth. If anything, this movie should be label as 'one of the greatest love stories of all time'. Because of this, I wouldn't say, this is action-packed film. The love story takes a big part of the movie, making the fight with Apollo, somewhat secondary. I know, that some people might find this choice in direction, a bit slow paced and somewhat boring, but if you can push through that, you would find yourself, loving the dramatic, more, because how awkward, and real, the love scenes, seemed, between the simple-minded, Rocky and the somewhat recluse, Adrian, even if Rocky is a bit, too dumb to taken serious, while Talia Shire's character, can be a bit off-putting, with her close-minded introvert attitude. It's worth it. You get, a lot of iconic unforgettable scenes like the ice skating sequence & the climatic 'Yo Adrian!' call-out. However, the best scenes in the film, had to be, the training montage. The sequence in Rocky uses meat carcasses as punching bags, and jogs through Philadelphia is very memorable. Yet, the best, out of these training sequences is the scene, where Rocky run up the Philadelphia Museum of Art's flight of stairs. It got so famous, that tourists, around the world, often mimic Rocky's famous climb, as a metaphor for an underdog or an everyman rising to a challenge. The site also got Rocky statue, situated just northeast of the steps as a memorial. Nevertheless, one of the most common misconceptions about this movie, is that, Rocky's trainer, Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith) help Rocky, train for his fight. In truth, most of that training, including the infamous 'catch the chicken' scene was, in 1979's 'Rocky II"". In this film, Mickey barely does anything, but make Rocky's life, a living hell. So, don't bring up, your hope, in, seeing them, connect with each other. As for other supporting characters, like Paulie (Burt Young). He was alright, but his character hasn't yet, became the famous comic relief, that he would become, in later movies. In this, he just a big fat jerk, most of the time, who doesn't know, if he wants to hook up Rocky with his sister or not. It's a bit confusing. As for Apollo Creed, Weathers really has the charisma to pull this role, off. I really don't think, the movie's original choice, real-life boxer, Ken Norton, could do this. As for the main character, Rocky, I really couldn't see, anybody else, playing the role besides Stallone, because how much Rocky mirrors his real-life. However, I do have to say, the original choice, James Caan does look the part of a fighter when, parodying himself, in 1976's 'Silent Movie'. He was very close, in becoming the title character, before the studio took a chance with Stallone in the lead role. Nevertheless, I still think, every actor in this movie, played their roles to the fullest, despite how mean-spirited, their characters, were, even the cameos from real-life, boxer, Joe Frazier. However, I do have to say, some supporting characters were a bit, pointless. A good example is little Marie (Jodi Letizia) who pretty much, disappears for the rest of the life, after Rocky's life talk. Her character doesn't really come back, until, much later, in the sequels. So, what was the point of having her!? It's filler. It's weird, that this movie won, Best Editing & Best Screen writing at the Oscars, that year, but they kept scenes like that. They really could had cut her from the movie. Anyways, I still kinda glad, the film script was somewhat influence by a real-life fight, between journeyman boxer, Chuck Wepner against controversial, charismatic, and overconfident champion Muhammad Ali. I just kinda wish, Wepner didn't take it, so personal. There wasn't no need to file a lawsuit with Stallone for an undisclosed amount. Rocky acts and looks nothing like him. Anyways, with its Cinderella 'feel-good' crowd-pleasing story, 'Rocky' was the highest-grossing film of 1976. The film was nominated for ten Oscars and won three, including best picture; which 'Rocky' became the first sport film to do. The film also spawned six sequels: Rocky II (1979), Rocky III (1982), Rocky IV (1985), Rocky V (1990), Rocky Balboa (2006), and Creed (2015), the latter a Spin-Off about Apollo Creed's son, with hit and misses results. Nevertheless, overall: Despite some goofs in production, this low-budget movie was indeed, a huge hit for me. It's a movie, I will watch, time and time, again. I highly recommended seeing it. It's worth going to the distance for.",_

28,31 December 2021,nickenchuggets,9, The Italian Stallion,"If you've seen any movie in the popular Rambo series, it's easy to understand why Sylvester Stallone has a reputation as a tough guy, much like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Clint Eastwood. That might be his public image now, but that wasn't always the case. A few years before Rambo, a boxing movie named Rocky was released. This film is much different from something like Rambo because Stallone actually plays a more humble character in it, and the movie is quite depressing at times because he can't seem to get his life together. Even the ending isn't as triumphant as it seems, which is something I'll get to talking about later. This helps to make Rocky more believable as a character because he's not invincible, and is subjected to bad luck and hard times that everyone on earth can have happen to them. The movie is about the titular Rocky Balboa (Stallone), a down on his luck boxer who makes barely enough money to stay alive by fighting in local gymnasiums and extorting people for a loan shark. One of the gyms Rocky frequents is supervised by Mickey (Burgess Meredith), who has been in the boxing business since the 1920s. He serves as a kind of father figure to Rocky, despite the latter being somewhat angry at him for refusing to train him in the past. Later, we are shown how the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) plans to fight Rocky because his scheduled opponent is suddenly unable to compete against him. A representative visits Rocky and tells him to try and understand the magnitude of the situation he's in right now. The champion of the world has selected him as a potential rival, and he may never get a chance like this again. Rocky accepts the offer, and starts training under Mickey's leadership. Meanwhile, Rocky begins an (initially) awkward relationship with a girl named Adrian (Talia Shire), who is the sister of his friend Paulie. Paulie works at a meat packing factory, which Rocky frequents and trains at by punching hanging slabs of meat. As Rocky's physical prowess grows through training, so does his reputation. He becomes a local celebrity, and Apollo watches his progress on tv when reporters are sent to interview him. He even gets to meet Apollo at one point. The day before New Year's, Rocky visits the Philadelphia Spectrum (where the fight is to take place) and feels his spirits start to fade. He knows Creed is the best the world has to offer, and being just an average guy who not many people have heard about, he has no chance against him. Still, the fight begins the next day, and Rocky faces off against Creed in the ring. Apollo effortlessly kites Rocky's punches and stays at the edge of his reach, while closing the distance occasionally to hit him in the face. Despite this, Rocky manages to land a solid hit on Creed that causes his (so far) only time being knocked down. Rocky now knows Apollo isn't invincible, but Creed still remains arrogant throughout the rest of the match. The match lasts the maximum amount of time allowed (15 rounds), with both Creed and Rocky sustaining numerous injuries. Although it's apparent that Creed is the better fighter, Rocky never gets knocked down no matter what Apollo throws at him. As the match finally runs out of time, Rocky and Apollo come close to each other and swear there won't be another time they fight. As expected, the audience goes crazy and Adrian runs to the ring in order to be reunited with Rocky. Apollo has won the fight (technically) according to the judges, but Rocky has shown the whole world he had enough stamina and willpower to stand face to face with him, and that's what matters. I found Rocky to be a pretty entertaining movie, but was surprised at the sheer amount of filler it has. Lots of people get this idea that the franchise is about boxing and not much else, but this film proves that notion wrong. Most of the movie doesn't have much to do with boxing, and we instead see what Rocky does on a daily basis. Before getting into his relationship with Adrian, he visits her at her pet store workplace, from which Rocky bought some turtles. We see Paulie go insane and smash things in his house with a bat because he's getting envious of his friend's popularity. They also show how Mickey tries to get back into Rocky's good graces and offers to train him, but Rocky doesn't want to hear it because all the times he needed help from him before, he didn't answer. That's exactly what makes this movie special. It doesn't have a very pleasant feel to it. Rocky doesn't even win the fight at the end, but he is still happy with himself because he worked hard to get to that point. Getting strong enough to stand up to Apollo took time, and the movie shows all the difficulties involved with doing that. Even though he's not featured all that much, I liked Meredith's performance as Mickey. He's a reproachable and easily upset person, but being 76 years old, he has more patience than you would think. He gets frustrated a lot, but puts up with Rocky because he wants to see him become famous by fighting Apollo. Adrian on the other hand gives Rocky a purpose and drive to succeed. Even if he doesn't win, he trains anyway because it makes her happy to see him make something of himself. The music by Bill Conti is also pretty iconic, and even today, many people film themselves running up those steps to the art museum with Gonna Fly Now playing in the background. Even though sports never interested me, Rocky is a classic sports movie that will probably always be recognized as one of the genre's finest.",r

Sylvester Stallone does an impressive job here in his career-making and career-defining role as the dumb, penniless semi-pro boxer who is given his once in a lifetime shot at the world champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). Pretty self-explanatory plot. Most sports underdog movies that have come along since have attempted to imitate the training montages and the utter hopelessness and humiliation that Rocky feels at certain low points in the plot. Imitated, but never mastered quite as well as the original, in my opinion. Talia Shire also does great in her role as Adrian.",

This film, even with the occasional technical issues and bad punches, is a wonderous underdog story that brings me joy every time I watch it.

But what won Best Picture in the year of Taxi Driver, Network and All the President's Men---the legendary arguable masterpieces of three of contemporary cinema's finest directors---is this paint-by-numbers inspirational sports flick. Stallone's screenplay is the most wholesome 1930s Hollywood fantasy. It's the tale of Rocky and his girl Adrian, when he, because of conditions too irrational to go into, is given the chance to fight the world heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed, fashioned after Muhammad Ali so sketchily as to be a practically senseless misuse of character. It's not sufficient enough to even be defamation, but by making the Ali-like fighter such a garish fool, the film treads regions of undeveloped racism that might not be all that undeveloped.",

Even the slow scenes had my attention and I really felt for the character Rocky Balboa despite him being fictional and all. Sylvester Stallone did a fantastic job writing to script and I could tell why he wanted badly to take the lead role in this. Even by making big sacrifices and taking cuts in his paycheck to make it work. It really is a touching boxing film. The build up has a lot of meat to it and when it hits it brings the momentum.

Hollywood executives wanted names more famous than him as potential choices to live the Italian Stallion: the most highly rated were Robert Redford, Ryan O'Neal, Burt Reynolds and James Caan. But he stamped his foot: he would only sell the script if the role was his. It achieved its goal thanks to the support of producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff. The initial budget for filming the film would be $ 2 million, but they cut that amount in half to offset the risks of having a stranger as the protagonist. To make it all right, they thought of rising actresses like Carrie Snodgress and Susan Sarandon to live Adrian, but who led the character was Talia Rose Coppola Shire, sister of Francis Ford, known for The Godfather parts I (1972) and II (1974). For Apollo, boxer Ken Norton was thought of, but Carl Weathers was the winner of the shorts with the colors and stripes of the USA flag.

Rocky isn't just about some guy getting the shot of a lifetime, it's about the conquering spirit which seems to be inside each and every person, whether they believe it or not.

While some may dispute this film as the best of 1976, one cannot deny the power and new ground it broke.

Rocky is so incredible lovable and relate-able and you just can't get enough and you become so completely fascinated with his life and his romance and everything he has done to fight his way to the top that by the time the match comes about you are practically on your feet rooting for him. Add to that the gritty, and melancholy setting of Philladelphia projects that begin to feel just like home as it is for Rocky. Stallone has always said that 'Rocky' was more than anything else a love story between him and Adrien and it really is now that I watch it for the purpose of reviewing it.

Rocky probably didn't deserve an Oscar over Taxi Driver but that aside Rocky is a rather uplifting drama that works because it concerns itself with the lives of an average joe. Sylvester Stallone is perfect as the average joe who is down to earth, likable even if not too bright. The fight sequence at the end is in particular well staged and it really does get the blood pumping although it's more about the pride of one man and his chance at accomplishment than it ever is about who is really winning.

88,25 July 2007,johno-21,9, The little story that could,"I saw this during it's initial theatrical release and I've seen it several times over the years as well as just recently for the first time in along time. It holds up well and is a remarkable film in many ways. It's creation and success is as improbable as it's story. An unknown struggling actor with tough guy looks writes a screenplay about a struggling boxing club fighter who is somehow given a chance to make the most improbable leap imaginable; a shot at the heavyweight championship of the world. Syvester Stallone wrote the story after seeing a fight between Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner. Wepner was a club boxer known as ""The Bayonne Bleeder"" who worked as a liquor salesman to make a living. In a boxing stunt to give an unknown a chance with a champion, a fight was arranged between he an Ali. The fight was expected to be a brief one with Ali hardly working up a sweat but Wepner went the full 15 round distance and even knocked Ali down once in the fight. In Rocky Stallone plays the title role of a club fighter who works as a collection enforcer for a loan shark to make a living. He's a sensitive guy behind his tough exterior and has a crush on the mousy pet shop sales girl Adrian played by Talia Shire. Burt Young is Paulie, her brother. Burgess Meredeth is Mickey, the owner of the gym where Rocky fights. Carl Weathers is Apollo Creed the Champ who wants to give an unknown from the streets a chance to fight him. Rocky gets selected for the chance and Mickey trains him for the match. Meredeth was the best known of the cast at the time of the film. Shire was known for her recent supporting roles in The Godfather I and II but only for those roles and here is an opportunity to break from the Godfather. Stallone, Young, Weathers and the rest of the cast were relative unknowns. Shot on a small budget and in a 30 day shoot schedule it would make 50 times what it cost to make it during it's initial North American theatrical release and go on to be nominated for an incredible 10 Academy Awards, winning two of the biggest in Best Picture and Best Director and a third for Best Film Editing. John Alvidson who had some critical success with Joe and Save the tiger get an Oscar for his direction. Scott Conrad and Richard Halsey early in their careers get an Oscar for their editing. James Crabbe is the cinematographer. Among the Academy Award nominations Rocky beat out a strong field that included Network, Taxi Driver and All the President's Men for Best Picutre. Stallone in his two nominations for Best Actor and Original Screenplay lost out to film veterans Peter Finch in Network and Paddy Chayefsky's Network screenplay. Young and Meredith may have canceled each other out with two of the five nominations for Best Supporting Actor and Jason Robards won the Oscar for All the President's Men in a strong field of nominees that also included Luarence Olivier and Ned Beatty. Meredith should have won the Oscar for his memorable performance. Shire lost out to Faye Dunaway in Network for Best Actress. This film of course went on to launch a franchise of Rocky films for Stallone but I would have preferred no sequels to this story. Just let it stand as it is as the little story that could. This is a very likable film filled with memorable scenes and duologue and shot on location in Philadelphia with a gritty look. It's worth a look if you've never seen it and worth a revisit if it's been awhile since you've seen it last. I would give it a 9.0 out of 10.",

It's also a role with much more depth than what Stallone usually subjects himself to, which isn't saying a whole lot considering the mindless tripe we see macho-man Stallone in, but I regained a lot of respect for the guy after seeing Rocky. It's one of the greatest underdog stories you'll ever see, following the story of Rocky Balboa, a small time boxer who is given the chance to make it big when all-star boxer Apollo Creed challenges him for a publicity stunt. Rocky takes this chance to become somebody and trains his heart out to beat Creed. It is a story of triumph and solid determination to overcome personal tribulations. It is an inspiring and well made film.",

I think that's the first step of any goal. Accepting clearly where you are, leaving the rest to times unknown, is the only thing required to conquer anything mammoth.
That moment when Rocky goes in Adrian's arms in the bed and accepts the fear for upcoming day, says he can't defeat Creed, but still promises to himself and her, to go the distance, I mean that's what courage is. If you have the conviction despite of what the world or even you for that matter think, then that's it. That's the only thing that matters, going the distance, no matter what the outcome is. We know that it's all about the journey. And if in those times you have somebody by your side, it's better. Somebody who could believe in you more than you do.
Another thing worth emulating of Rocky is ""Getting up again"", be it from your bed or that boxing ring of the world around.
Mickey, any less than that wouldn't have even been qualified for the job. ""women weaken your legs"", if that is to be believed then only one fierce like him can keep them away from you.

The lesson of life and the strong moral,"""Rocky 1"", a film that even after 40 years still manages to express its purity on the highest sentimental scale. A simple movie that still charms the story of the fifth-rate boxer who has never achieved anything relevant in life and one day has the opportunity to prove his worth. Rocky is to be just one more in the millions, but he had the chance, and he grabbed it, it's easy to identify, it's easy to cheer, it's easy to fall completely in love with the movie, which his big top was supposed to be the final fight , which is nothing more than a fight, because its result is irrelevant, Rocky has never been about winning or losing, but about overcoming your limits and achieving your dreams, and this is for every anthology. ""Rocky 1"" has a powerful moral that stirs the American dream, it's not the movie that takes place in the bicentennial year of American independence and its location, the sad, cold and depressing Philadelphia masterfully recorded by director of photography James Crab that manages to incorporate these characteristics that are fundamental to the film. His screenplay is simple but well built, the rocky, heartbroken, silly rocker, Balboa, who can not say no to anyone and is full of lessons and annoyances, and at the same time excites the viewer, his characterization is great and Rocky , as all the characters in the film are trying to prove something, Paulie, Adrian and Mickey, everyone has something to say and everyone develops along with Rocky, his script carries a development and individualities of impeccable characters that gives a unique three-dimensionality to each character . The good direction also helps the great script and the excellent performances, with one of the most vibrant, iconic, unique and exciting soundtrack of the history of the cinema, composed by Bill Conti, it is impossible not to mention its exquisite fit the work, that later would come to being an anthem not only of the franchise, but practically everything that involves boxing, other highlights are the excellent montages and compositions of scenes, costumes and the wonderful makeup, mainly in the final fight that is ahead of its time in terms of makeup and effects . Rocky is pure feeling, Stallone shines in this film as nobody, with script written by him in three days and a beautiful performance, the brucuto that years later would be seen as bad movie signal shows his talent, or not, because Rocky is a mirror of Stallone's life, he does not act, he only lives the character he created himself in the truest way I've ever seen in the movies, ""Rocky I"" was an absolute success, such as Stallone, born along with the powerful franchise which would be created in the future. This film goes beyond many technical or aritic aspects, it is a lesson, a feeling, a more complete demonstration of clarity of ideas, with problems is true, especially in its rhythm and in the narrowing of the third act but even so Rocky enchants the world more than 40 years for its genuinely true and touching simplicity.",

This is the original Cinderella Man, a boxing story wherein the final outcome doesn't matter so much because the training montage already has the protagonist (and the audience) bursting with exhilaration. Low-life, good-hearted Phillie boxer Rocky is invited to go the distance with the heavyweight champion, a show-off in the Muhammad Ali mold. The human dynamics--with Rocky's aged trainer, his mousy sweetheart and her loud-mouthed brother--nearly turn the early scenes of the picture into a replay of a ""Playhouse 90"" sketch, and the boxing choreography and cinematography are both disappointing. However, when Stallone takes to the streets in his workout sweats, and Bill Conti's music floods the screen (the equivalent of a cheering section), all is forgiven. Stallone's writing is basic, however he does allow his characters to take shape--and he stays out of their way in the process.

It runs for pretty much exactly two hours and takes us on a journey with Rocky Balboa, a formerly very talented boxer, who just fights for little sums of money these days, and also a debt collector with fairly violent methods. The first hour of the film is basically about the title character's relationship with a friend and his sister, who he has been crushing on for a while. The two become a couple around the 1-hour mark, so the second half has more focus on the actual fight that is about to happen.

Strength of spirt more than of body, although Rocky can really throw a punch (and take one as well) and that training montage will forever be awesome. Rocky is one of the most endearing characters ever in my opinion. He is someone who you just can't help but root for (just watch Rocky IV).

Would you let it go pass because it is almost impossible to achieve or you want to use all you have to give it a great shot? This is what the movie about, how a struggling underdog became hero, legend or more. This is the one of my favorite movies. Because it has a simplest storyline but it successfully gave expression to it's theme-if you want to be on the top, you have to pay the price which means hardworking and determination A good movie must require an understandable storyline which clearly tells its theme. That is why I think rocky is a great movie. The movie is about the sudden life change of a struggling underdog boxer-Rocky, the world champion set up a fight between himself and Rocky, but he decided to give it the greatest shot just to prove that he is not a bum for a entertainment show. So basically, whole movie is about how Rocky trying so hard to achieve his goal: go the distance with the champion.",

148,7 March 2009,Aaron1375,7, Of the Rocky's probably the most realistic.,"This movie was a rather good drama starring Sylvester Stallone as the title character Rocky. It also is one of those movies that has a theme that sticks with a person because it is so memorable. The movie, too is memorable although kind of slow moving in places as well. They try a bit to hard making Rocky seem real, showing a bit to many details of his courtship of Adrien, though I have to say that these scenes while slow help with the ending making it a bit more emotional. The story, the heavy weight champion of the world Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is about to fight a title bout. Well the person he is supposed to fight drops out so Apollo decides to fight an unknown guy and picks a local named Rocky. Rocky is a bit of a washed up fighter, he can win but he does so clumsily. The trainer who I think owns the gym, Mickey, decides to help Rocky train for this fight and these two opposing forces meet in the ring for more of a fight than Apollo was expecting. This fight is a bit more realistic than the fight in two in that Apollo was not taking this fight seriously at all and was not training hard. An underdog that he had never really seen before could have taken him by surprise the way Rocky did here. So a good fight sequence a some filler before then to pull at the heart strings and inspire one. Still good though for a sports movie.",

Stallone is an Italian hack boxer, in the underbelly of Philadelphia's rough boxing scene, fighting over the hill has been's, never-will-be's, and never have been's until his name is almost drawn from a hat, so to speak, by Apollo Creed's (The current world heavy weight champion) management at a time when the boxing world lacks solid contenders and Apollo figures that it will make him more popular with the fans if he gives a nobody a shot, but his manager thinks he might be barking up the wrong tree by picking a south paw that he knows nothing about. Apollo, being a business man, selects Rocky based on his ring name ""The Italian Stallion."" Rocky is in an inner city friend to the Italian Catholic community who stands behind him as he trains on the streets of the bicentennial city, in underground boxing gyms and in a meat locker, where he works for his future brother in law, by punching large slabs of meat into submission, in cold freezers. It's also a story about a simple man, in love with his city, culture, church and a simple girl, Adrien, who is the clerk at a pet shop below his apartment where he shops for turtle food, that he does not need, in order to have conversations with his future wife, who I might add, he never cheats on through 5 Rocky's (Refreshing).

156,11 March 2008,sddavis63,9, Definitely One Of The Greats,"This is not only one of the best sports movies ever made, it's got to rank as one of the most impressive films ever made. Rocky Balboa must be perhaps the most memorable character Hollywood has ever come up with. Really - is there another character that could compete? Maybe James Bond - except he wasn't a Hollywood creation; he came from novels. The memorable thing about Rocky is that he's everyone - everyone who has ever been down and out, everyone who has ever felt that life didn't give him a fair shot, everyone who has regrets about not having lived their dreams - and who doesn't fit in there somewhere? Rocky Balboa (whom Sylvester Stallone was absolutely born to play) is a bum. There's no other word for it. He's uneducated and crude, he lives in a rundown apartment in a rundown part of Philadelphia, he makes a living by collecting for the local loan shark and sometimes by being a club fighter, and from the opening scenes of the movie - featuring a depiction of one of his club fights - he's a club fighter who's even outclassed by the other club fighters, except that when he gets mad, boy can he punch! And - when he wins, bloodied and bruised, he gets the winner's share, which amounts to all of $40.55, if I remember correctly. But there's another side to Rocky. You see it early in the movie when he returns to his apartment after that club fight and he stares at a picture of himself as a young boy. It's in his eyes - ""What happened to me? What happened to that young boy?"" And you keep seeing it. There's a gentle, even playful side to him. He can't bear to break the thumbs of a guy who owes the loan shark money, he looks out for a young girl who's hanging out with a bad crowd, he picks up a drunk passed out on the cold streets outside a bar and carries him inside to warm up, he likes animals (he has pet turtles and a goldfish) and he plays with the animals at the local pet store. And - most important to the movie - there's a sweet sort of innocence to him as he struggles to come up with the words to ask the equally shy Adrian (Talia Shire) - who works at the pet store - for a date. Rocky is a far more complex character than most people think.",

The love story aspect is what anchors this inspiring movie. Without this, it simply would not nearly have the same impact. Two lovable losers, Rocky and Adrian, meet regularly in an innocent and tender way. She's shy enough to be afraid of her own shadow and he's a gregarious Paluka who talks a lot. When he takes her to his apartment it's about as awkward a date as can be after having a brief outing on an empty Ice rink. Adrian has concealed herself from the world by wearing layers of clothing, spectacles and a Mitten cap which covers her almost completely. As Rocky lowers her guard in his boyish and earnest way, we aren't sure how this will unfold. He asks her softly to take off her glasses. Then her hat.

But getting there is the joy in Rocky; getting there is not about sports but about life, companionship, living, just generally surviving less than pleasant conditions but most importantly: belief, the belief and eternal optimism that something good might well lurk around the corner. Sure, Rocky boxes but it's a hobby, a hobby that he can't really nail for whatever financial or lack-of-skills reason.

186,21 February 2007,dee.reid,10, You'll love it the first time you see it...,"...Which is ironic for me to say that because I'll admit the first time I saw the original 1976 ""Rocky,"" I wasn't all that impressed. Maybe it was because of Sylvester Stallone, his hammy Oscar-nominated role as the ""underdog"" boxer Rocky Balboa, or its lack of in-the-ring action (which is saved for the last 20 minutes) - I don't know, and I'm not sure I'll ever know. The point is, after a lot of soul-searching and realizing that ""Rocky"" is the real deal (plus a convenient chance at re-watching the film in its glory), I find that ""Rocky"" is very easily one of the best movies ever made. The story of strength, determination, and the desperate need of a new hero in the wake of political turmoil during the 1970s helped Rocky Balboa's eventual rise to fame at the box office in '76, and his subsequent entry into pop culture history. At the heart of the film, is the title character, a hard-luck Philadelphia loser played gloriously by Stallone. The muscle for a local loan shark, his only real source of pride is in the ring, besting other fighters who are way below his skill level. On the side, he also flirts with Adrian (Talia Shire), the sister of his best friend Paulie (Burt Young) who is also the chronically shy clerk of the pet store where he frequents. When the reigning world heavyweight champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) discovers he needs a challenger for the upcoming Bicentennial because all the rest of the competition has bowed out, he chooses the ""Italian Stallion"" out of other contenders. When Rocky gets the news, he sees it as a chance to prove his worth and ""go the distance"" and start training with a former champ, Mickey (Burgess Meredith). ""Rocky"" was a huge hit in 1976, as Stallone's script floated around Hollywood for several years before being picked up by United Artists and given to director John G. Avildsen. Sure, ""Rocky"" gets off to a slow start. But that's part of its magic: to let the audience really know who these people are, and the lives they are leading. The big day does come, but there's something about the conclusion of the picture that will always remain true to real life, and about that once-in-a-lifetime, million-to-one shot at glory.",

Like Rudy, Rocky was based on true events. For Stallone, it was his chance to be a superstar. It was not only his break through performance that made Stallone a star. Many forget that Rocky was his screenplay. Much like the 1,000 - 1 shot that was Good Will Hunting, Stallone was in the same situation as Mat Damon and Ben Affleck. Both films were true labors of love. Both believed in their stories. Each wanted to do more than just make a little movie and earn a pay check from it. Rocky has become more and more of a classic as time passes. It is a universal story with themes of true grit and passion. More than just movies, the message that films like Rudy, Rocky, and Good Will Hunting leave the audience is timeless. They not only score big at the box office, they hit close to home with a story that is pure and truthful. These movies capture the essence of the settings they take place in whether it be Boston, Philadelphia or Notre Dame. If done right, the overall theme of the common man making his mark and beating the odds is a genre that is dynamic and well encouraged.",

Stallone wrote and starred in the Lords of Flatbush it launched a lot of careers but failed at the box office. Struggling Stallone wrote a novel and a screenplay for PARADISE ALLEY that he failed to sell then he went to the Bar to see Ali fight Chuck Wepner. Stallone became inspired. He only had 120 dollars in the bank. Inspired he wrote Rocky in a fever pitch during the course of three days. Stallone sold it but stipulated that he and only he play Rocky. A gutsy move that paid off. Rocky had the makings of a hit. The Studio didn't want Stallone as Rocky they wanted Burt Reynolds or Jon voight. but Stallone stood his ground and won,

206,9 April 2022,RonellSowes,9, Great Film We Didn't Need The Sequels,There's no other way of saying than straight up: Rocky has been vitiated by its sequels. What could have been another classic 70's Oscar winning drama has simply become the first of a series of silly and over the top boxing movies. Maybe Rocky II gave us the conclusion we wanted and Mr T single handedly redeemed Rocky III(everything afterwards is garbage)but the further they progressed the less they focused on character and more on boxing.,

But they pale in comparison to the original now.  A classic movie, instantly making Stallone a star and introducing the ""feel good"" movie for a new generation (which may or may not be a good thing). The movie has such a genuine feel - much like ""Good Will Hunting"", it gives a seemingly accurate glimpse into urban blue collar life.  The music is also masterfully done... of course the main theme is immediately recognizable (and if it doesn't get your heart rate up, you must be comatose), but the supporting music creates a wonderful ambience... the music Rocky plays on his turntable, the lone french horn theme as he begins his training, the a capella group in the beginning - it's all classic.",

I don't know what makes Rocky Balboa so sympathetic apart from the obvious contrast with the big bad opponent, but get this, I think it's Stallone's acting. Some people see him as a hormone-enhanced bodybuilder stereotype who just happened to be around when they needed someone tough. Those people are entitled to their measly, inferior, wrong opinions, but Stallone has got talent. Even if you don't take into account that he wrote the screenplay, hey what the hell I will take that into account. This is a solid screenplay. There are just so many good ideas in there. Balboa is just a great anti-hero. He was milked a lot over the years, but somehow always managed to keep his dignity. Furthermore, there's a great joy in seeing Rocky running around places accompanied by flocks of cheering bystanders. It's the cheesiest thing, but you can sense the euphoria. And let's not forget the undying ""Rocky"" theme. Everything about this movie is just so awesome.",

The first true underdog boxing story with iconic lines scenes and characters has anyone who watches it wanting to run a mile and become the heavyweight champ of the world. The story of nobody to somebody might as well have been invented by this movie. There is nothing that gives me more goose bumps in all of cinema than this movie. From the incredible training scene, capped off by arguably the most famous shot in all of film of Rocky's arms in the air after climbing the steps of the church, to the ending of the fight as when Apollo sees rocky down and thinks he has the fight one only to see rocky get back up and taunt Apollo to fight some more. The incredible writing acting and cinematography in this movie makes it a classic every time you put it on. Ending it with Rocky losing on paper but truly winning in the hearts of the fans and viewers at home was something so original at the time that it was the perfect ending to the most transcendent sports movie ever made.",
217,4 December 2009,jboothmillard,9, Rocky,"Described as one of the best uplifting dramas ever made, and probably the most popular underdog story of all time, I had to see it, from Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director John G. Avildsen (The Karate Kid). Basically Rocky Balboa (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Sylvester Stallone) is a struggling small-time boxer in Philadelphia, who works in a meat factory, and also collects debts for loan shark Gazzo (Joe Spinell). Rocky boxes once in a while to develop his skills, his ex-trainer Mickey (Batman's Oscar nominated Burgess Meredith) thinks he could be on top if he really worked hard, which is why he is really hard on him. Current world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Predator's Carl Weathers) is visiting Philadelphia, and after a match he was keen on falls through, he and his promoters decide to set up a once in a lifetime opportunity for an unknown boxer to fight him, they of course pick Rocky, ""The Italian Stallion"". Rocky, while training for this event, is trying to get closer to his local pet shop owner Adrian (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Talia Shire), who is very shy, but they do fall for each other. So it comes to the big match, and after Rocky in his training montage, with that iconic theme, he is ready to face Apollo, and it takes more than three rounds to finish either of them off. The final round is really hard to watch, and even though Rocky didn't win, you really feel up in arms for him, and he and Adrian declare their love for each other. Also starring Oscar nominated Burt Young as Paulie, Thayer David as Jergens and Joe Frazier. Stallone is brilliantly convincing as the no-hoper boxer who makes the most of his opportunity, Weathers does well as a worthy opponent, Shire wonderful being quiet and attractive, and Meredith, still almost quacking like his Penguin, is gloriously over-the-top grouchy. This is a story that will appeal to all those people out there who want to achieve something, and this shows with hard work, it can be done, and it doesn't necessarily matter how long it lasts, with the iconic montage sequence and catchy music, and the great fight sequences, especially of course the finale, this is a must see boxing drama. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Song for ""Gonna Fly Now"" (which was number 58 on 100 Years, 100 Songs), Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Stallone, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Editing, Best Screenplay and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score for Bill Conti and Best Screenplay. Rocky Balboa was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, ""Yo, Adrian."" was number 80 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, the film was number 78 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 70 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, it was number 52 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers.

I don't think there's a single person who has seen ""Rocky"" whether or not they enjoy it who would disagree with him. I don't even think the movie's makers, including writer/star Sylvester Stallone would strongly argue against that. It is sort of an old-fashioned tale about the underdog trying to become somebody in a moment that is really a scandalous motive for publicity. But as much as I admire and will always admire Mr. Canby as a critic and thinking man, I cannot agree with his overall verdict of ""Rocky.""

It's striking how this really is one of those films that I've coloured in my view of it over the years by things that are little or nothing to do with the film itself - toxic masculinity, cheesy sequels, a childhood embarrassment seeing Rocky 4 in the cinema, the culture that grows up around the film ... and much else. And yet ... revisiting it now, its qualities are striking. How little happens in the first 30-45 minutes or so apart from character and establishing the scuzzy, grimy, down-at-heel, urban feel, the sweet growing relationship with Adrian, who little actual boxing there is in the film, even the result of the fight itself. Its status as an Oscar winner, and everything Stallone went on to become and much else besides that has shaped my perceived opinion are all really moot; it's really pretty good. Who knew?",

231,15 July 2019,Falconeer,8, A Real Story,"This is what people want, real stories about people that they can relate to. The original ""Rocky"" brilliantly captures one man's struggle so profoundly, so elegantly, that it is almost poetic. Stuck in a nowhere job, doing something for a living that literally makes him sick to his stomach, (who can relate to that?), Rocky is big and strong enough to work as a heavy...a debt collector for some nasty Philly loan sharks. The problem is, his personality doesn't fit with that kind of work, because he's a good guy, that likes people. So when he sees the opportunity to step into the ring with established Heavyweight Champion of the World, Apollo Creed, he takes his chance. Not for the opportunity to buy a Ferrari or gold chains or fur coats, but just so he can have a life that is better than the grinding poverty and hopelessness that he is living every day. He also has a good woman that he goes crazy for. Adrian isn't most people's idea of ""beautiful,"" but Rocky loves this woman, and knows that he wants to give her everything.
Rocky enters the competition, and with the help of his trainer Mickey, (today an iconic movie character) he soon begins to believe in himself, and that he can win. And by some fluke...he DOES win, making Rocky Balboa a true local hero. His win also ENRAGES the Champ, Apollo Creed, who becomes obsessed with a rematch, in order to reclaim his title. That brutal second fight, is the culmination of one of the most dramatically powerful films of all time. It's conclusion literally had people cheering and rolling in the aisles. When was the last time you have seen that happen? ""Rocky"" is great because it truly makes the point that any dream is attainable, if you truly believe in yourself. This movie also put the city of Philadelphia on the map. It's hard to think of Philly without thinking of Rocky and all the sequels. A special nod goes to the cinematography, which captures Philly in all it's dark, atmospheric glory. Followed by many sequels, all of them having a certain value in it's own way, and making a statement about the time in which they were made. And ""Rocky"" was a film that had something that today's movies just don't have...it has a heart, and a soul.",
232,2 July 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8, One of Stallone's best films,"Let me start this review of by making one thing absolutely clear; I hate boxing. I don't even consider it a sport. I consider it legalized violence, that people pay money to see, knowing that each blow to the head costs countless braincells. So, there is no way I would ever like a boxing movie. But Rocky isn't a boxing movie. It's not about boxing; it's about determination, will-power, and doing what you can to realize your dream. That's why I think Rocky is a great movie; it has something that everyone can relate to. Many people who watch this movie don't know the first thing about boxing, nor do they care about it(myself included); but everybody has a dream, something that they want to accomplish, something great they want to achieve at some point in their life. And that's why it's going to appeal to so many different people; everyone can relate to the theme: wanting to realize a dream. The plot is good, it moves along at a slow, steady pace, so you will need to be fairly patient with this film. Don't worry, the waiting pays off in the end. That I can promise you. The acting is pretty good, by pretty much everyone in the film, even Stallone, who I'm normally not at all impressed by. The characters are well-written, credible and likable(the ones we're supposed to like, at least). The story and theme is something that really sparks some interesting thought, especially since this was based on something that really happened. It's definitely one of Stallone's best films. I recommend it to fans of Stallone, and people who the subject appeals to(which should be many, many people) who has the patience to sit through a somewhat slow-moving two-hour movie(which narrows it down a little). 8/10",

Rocky is a nobody that soon finds himself at the top. Everything's possible for the little guy with courage. You might actually draw a parallel with Sylvester Stallone's own life. Before Rocky, he was almost unknown. He wrote the script for Rocky. It took him years of work but it paid off real big.",
240,5 August 2016,skyluke1985,8, A story about real life winners,"First of all this movie is not about the boxing. This movie is about a fighter (Rocky) who struggles with his life without losing his courage to continue pursuing his dreams. It is movie about courage, about love, about unfulfilled dreams. It is a movie that shows with which the real life winners are made from. In the first scenes we meet Rocky. The man who tries to make some cash by participating in low level boxing games, but he doesn't want to. He knows that his life and his potential is far above. Then he comes back home where he reveals to us his loneliness and his unhappiness for himself. He is so lonely that he is talking to his turtles, sharing his news with them and feeding them. After he looks himself in the mirror, where there are hanging photos of his childhood and early life and next to the mirror is a poster of his idol, the boxer Rocky Marciano. His is unhappy about his life and thinking that his life turned to be different than it should be. The important thing is that behind his loneliness and his disappointment is a smile that never fades away and a positive attitude for life. Although life has treated him bad, he is not a give up guy and continue to pursue his dreams. ",
241,15 July 2002,EijnarAmadeus,9, A touching film full of spirit and hope.,"ROCKY tells a familiar rags-to-riches story that has that amazing thing about it that no matter how many times you've seen the film, it's always engaging, uplifting and hopeful. Sylvester Stallone wrote it while his acting career had slowly started becoming a dead-end, and he realized a story that reflected his own with Rocky ""The Italian Stallion"" Balboa, a promising small-time boxer that threw it all away and wanders the streets serving the local loan-shark as collector. Boxing champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) decides to face off an unknown in his New Year bout and picks Rocky, which gives the Italian Stallion one last shot at glory. What Stallone truly understood while writing this film, is that to make such a fairy-tale work he had to capture it realistically, and it had to be captured emotionally. He and director John G. Avildson managed both; the dirty streets and corners of Philadelphia paints Rocky's character along his tender romance with Adrian (Talia Shire), his relationship with her brother Paulie (Burt Young) and his own grizzled coach Mickey (Burgess Meredith). ROCKY stands tall alongside Scorsese's RAGING BULL (1980) as the best boxing- film of all time.",

It is more than just a story about an underdog boxer who makes the best of a title shot.  It is a story about perseverance, heart and courage.  Most of all it is a story about transcendence.  All the major characters in the film, including Apollo Creed, transcended their previous limitations.  If you reflect on it, Mick, Paulie, Adrian and Rocky were all changed people by the end of the film.  Apollo was changed too, but we didn't realize it until the sequel.  ",

255,26 September 2020,TheHonestCritic,10, This movie marks the beginning of a legendary film franchise. How does it hold up today?,"""Rocky"" (1976), as far as boxing films go, this one, along with the other five movies, top them all without question. I do have to admit something though before I get into my review. As a kid, I didn't like the ""Rocky"" films nearly as much as I do now. But, as I got older, I gradually understood them better and learned to appreciate them more. Plus, as I grew up, the storylines were much easier to understand. Nowadays, I can't get enough of the six ""Rocky"" films! Any way, let's just get back to my review. ""Rocky"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The story at first glance just sounds like your typical underdog story of an amateur boxer realizing his dreams. I can assure you, it is much more than that. Yes, it is a boxing film, but it is so much more than that. It has many great morals, a decent love story, and more! This is the underdog story done right, where you personally care about the main characters and want them to succeed in the end. The acting is some of the best in movie history, all of the actors and actresses give it their all and put on stellar performances. However, the biggest standout has to be Sylvester Stallone as Rocky himself. Had someone else been cast in the role, it would not have worked. Sylvester Stallone is Rocky, and he always will be. It is, by far, his all-time best performance. Now, he has acted well in other movies, but Rocky is his signature character. Talia Shire as Adrian is a brilliant love interest, Burt Young is fantastic as Paulie, Burgess Meredith is phenomenal as Mickey and Carl Weathers is great as Apollo. One thing I always say, your main characters are only as strong as your side characters. Every role is performed flawlessly, therefore, impeccable chemistry between the cast is brought to the screen. All of the sets/locations are perfect and give the film a fantastic atmosphere. One cool thing about this movie, along with the other five films, is that it is filmed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The reason why that makes it stronger is because it's not too far from my original home town of Milford, Delaware. Just about a two hour drive away. Statistically speaking, it hits close to home! All of the special effects are perfect and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Bill Conti is nothing short of stunning. Bill Conti is one of my top 10 all-time favorite film score composers, and this soundtrack is no exception. My personal favorite track has got to be, ""Gonna Fly Now"". That's one of my top 10 favorite pieces of music in any film. Whenever I think about it in my head, my spirits rise and I feel like I can accomplish anything! ""Rocky"" is a cinematic masterpiece and the start of an iconic movie series. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you're looking to watch a boxing film, look into this movie. I sincerely promise that you will not regret it. Take notes, Martin Scorsese, this is how you make a boxing film!",
256,26 February 2006,OriginalMovieBuff21,10," Inspirational, stunning, and moving-One of the greatest sports movies ever","Rocky is about a small time boxer from Philadelphia who gets a once in a lifetime offer to challenge heavyweight champ, Apollo Creed. This is one of the most moving and inspiring films that I have ever seen. Rocky Balboa played by Sylvester Stallone, who also wrote the screenplay for the film, played an absolutely breathtaking performance that made him an icon in today's films. Stallone is backed up by other really good performances from Talia Shire as Adrian, Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed, Burt Young as Paulie, and Burgess Meredith as Mickey. The film is extremely stunning in its own aspects and is inspirational to never give up and always work at what you've been brought up to. This is a fantastic sports movie that moved me in every way. I highly recommend ""Rocky!""",
257,10 September 2014,samurott74,10, Why Rocky is the Movie of all time,"Why is Rocky the best movie ever made? I know why, Rocky is a underdog who gets a shot at the big league by fighting the cocky Apollo Creed in a boxing match through the whole movie you grow attached to Rocky as he goes from being some decent south paw boxer to the man who blew everyone away. I love every character in this movie especially Rocky and his trainer Mickey, Mickey is Rocky's coach who is the classic broken down mentor character who even though is old is also very wise he has a lot of wisdom to share with Rocky as he helps him get stronger and readies him to fight Apollo. Then There's Rocky's love interest Adrian who at first is shy and socially awkward opens up to Rocky as we the audience does to, and then there's Adrian's brother Paulie who is a friend of Rocky who always puts Adrian down and later he gets what he has coming to him and although you may see Apollo Creed as the antagonist he's not really a bad guy he's the one who gives Rocky the shot. This entire movie is amazing there's never a boring scene your always on the edge of your seat waiting for the final fight and when it happens your just like what he doesn't win but doesn't lose he just went through all 15 rounds with Apollo but I like this ending most people would be all like OK cliché he's going to win but he doesn't win or lose. That's why I love this movie so much all I can say is go watch your in for a treat.",

I'm a big fan, having seen it 5-times or so - once even with the DVD commentary. I've usually focused on the Mick scenes, always looking forward to his visit to Rocky's apartment. This time, I was drawn to Adrian. Only in this viewing did I notice how Rocky's relationship with Adrian is more important to his character arc than his match with Creed. It's Adrian that helps him stop feeling like a loser. The Apollo fight is framed before-and-after with key Adrian moments - first in Rocky's bedroom and then in the film's iconic final moment. It's all about her.",

The sequels may have been more simplistic, forgetting that the boxing part was actually a sub-plot, but they are all enjoyable. This film is the most meaningful though. The relationship between Rocky and Adrian takes centre stage and despite the un-realistic story with respect of the boxing, this is more engaging, this is basically an against the odds movie, not designed for realism but to have elements of realism in it. The script is good and Sly hasn't written anything nearly as good since. What makes this film so successful however are the fantastic performances. Stallone is excellent as Rocky, its a fantastic performance right down to the way Rocky moves and the mannerisms, while Talia Shire is equally good as Adrian. The scenes between Sly and Talia are movie magic. Burgess Meredith is also excellent and there is a fantastic turn form Burt Young as Adrian's abusive brother Paulie.

Yes, it was low budget, even for 1976, but it's one of the aspects of the film that actually works to it's advantage. Rocky is a man from the humble streets of Philadelphia, poor and seemingly going nowhere in life. The movie, much like it's sequels paralleled the struggles that Stallone faced making it as an actor. The cinematography and the way it's shot really sympathizes with the way Rocky saw his life. Stallone with his charm and wit took a lot of the limitations and budget restrictions of the movie and just made it work. It is unquestionably the best of the series. As time goes by it's more clear that this film carries an inspiration that resonates. I recently visited the city of Philadelphia, and saw the Rocky statue, and felt the movie has a lasting legacy, not just for Philadelphia but for all humanity. The scene just before the fight where Rocky reveals to Adrian his doubts and fears about fighting Apollo was shot at the last minute but is one of the key scenes to the movie.

If Spacey and Norton could show the range of emotions Stallone shows in this, i would admit that they are great actors, but they haven't yet, so i won't.

A Classic For Everyone.,"Many are unaware that Stallone got the idea of a screenplay for Rocky from a professional fight between little-known Chuck Wepner and Muhammad Ali. A fight in which little-known Wepner went the fifteen round distance with the greatest Ali. It took Stallone only three days to write the story of an underdog boxer named Rocky Balboa. Shot on a shoestring budget in just under a month, Stallone had the sleeper hit of 1976, winning Best Picture and Director Oscars while Stallone received acting and writing nominations. Rocky is a beloved classic for many reasons the film has a certain theme to it the film has more to it than fighting for the heavyweight championship of the world. Most importantly Rocky gives a message of fighting and standing up for what you believe in. No matter how much of an underdog you are fight for what you believe and prove the doubters wrong. Balboa proves this by finding love with shy Adrian(Talia Shire) proving no matter how awkward a person may seem love is possible for anyone and they can live the American Dream together. Rocky is more than a movie about a fourth-rate boxer who gets a shot at the title. Aside from finding love the film is a study of finding one's self through hard work and determination though Rocky Balboa(Stallone) taste defeat at the hands of Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) he felt that of a winner for going the distance proving it's not whether you win or lose or draw , but whether or not you fight hard. Remember(Balboa) his whole life was a million-to-one chance. Sure Rocky was what made Sly Stallone a movie superstar, and Rocky also came to be a film that helped start what we call sequels. The main message in Rocky is for anyone who's ever won or lost hope and happiness are always possible. Success is possible to any underdog who works hard. Rocky is a symbol of the American Dream. Finally Rocky is one of the best films of the century a must watch for anyone and you will want to review the sentimental theme of the film many times. A classic forever.",

It is true that his interpretation is not any wonder, but the script of this film is one of the best I've seen. With a beautiful love story between two shy characters and a not-so-high self-esteem of course, far from Hollywood's glamorous love relationships and the underlying theme of success and failure in life, we find ourselves with a very well built, it hurts whoever hurts.
If this is signed by another director and the script was signed by another person, the media of IMDb would shoot up like the foam, because I'm sick of having seen movies with scripts and very mediocre stories with averages superior to this excellent film, only endorsed by the name of the one who signed them. But in the end, all that matters, the really important thing is that we can always get excited again and again with the great performance of the fight between Apollo and the ""Italian Stallion"".

This is his one and only good film the sequels to rocky are the same hollywoodish feel-good movies not really worth watching ... some of the moments and dialougues in the movie stuck to my heart and made me cry ....... Stallone give the performance of his lifetime as rocky balboa a man who is criticized by even his closest friends as a no good bum. The final boxing scene is very realistic ... the movie on the whole is very realistic ... this movie is about a true champion ... a core fighter at heart ..... it is the story of an underdog who lives his dream ... it is the story of a free spirit ...... embark on an emotional journey of a lifetime with stallone ...he didn't need to act in this movie he was just rocky ....

Rocky Balboa has become synonymous with being a nothing, and proving that you can become something, and the 1976 film Rocky is where we find him. He's too small, too much of a nobody to do anything in his amateur boxing career, but when he gets his shot at the champion, Apollo Creed (played with all of the flair of an Ali-like boxer by Carl Weathers), he proves to himself that he can do something with his life. In true typical Philadelphia fashion, he is worshiped, not as a champion but as a guy with a lot of heart who didn't quite make it to the top. We Philadelphians have to take solace in getting close but we never get to the top. Sylvester Stallone wrote and starred in this Oscar winner for best motion picture of 1976, and portrays a down and out bum who had one shot and took it. In the end, he may not have won the fight, but he's happy with the girl, Adrian (Talia Shire), knows that he gave it his all, and came this close to be a world champion. The later Rocky movies were not quite as inspiring, because Rocky wins (in most of them), and where is the fun in that?

There may never be another movie that can deliver such a force of the human spirit like Rocky does. A boxer facing a life going down the drain, and out of the blue he gets his one in a lifetime shot to make something of himself. He is offered to compete against the world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). Rocky struggles through decisions while fancying a love interest in Adrian (Talia Shire), and while Micky (Burgest Meredith) tries to offer his ring knowledge in hopes to become his trainer. Rocky then finds a hunger, an urge to at least 'go the distance' with the champ, being that the undefeated champ has never went 15 rounds of boxing with anyone. ""Rocky"" features spirit raising moments like when he does his famous jog up the Philidelphia stairs, workout, and one of the best boxing fights ever performed in cinematic history.

Add the fact he wrote the movie and you can see he deserves his superstar status. Ten years later he was doing stuff like Cobra but never mind! Rocky is as they say a true underdog story, a boxing story and above all a love story between Rocky and a shy pet shop worker called Adrian. Also a friendship between him and Adrians brother Paulie, a bitter man with a chip on his shoulder but a good guy underneath. Also Boxing trainer Mickey played by a superb Burgess Meridith and World Champion Appolo Creed played by the under-rated Carl Weathers. All the ingredients make this an amazingly uplifting movie. Praise to Bill Conti too for producing the now very familiar music, although there is very little of it at the beginning only when Rocky starts to train for the big fight. The film has so may memorable images, especially when Rocky runs up the steps in Philadelphia. Also loads of endlessly quotable lines, many of which are very funny. On a final note, one thing I have noticed about the Rocky movies, Rockys career seems to run very close to Stallones in as such if Rocky is on top of his career then so is Stallone in Hollywood. Rocky II is similar to this but III and IV are just pure entertainment and V tries to get back to the style of this one.

The fans don't like it and jeer, and as the fighter leading decides to crank it up a notch he backs the loser on the ropes and head butts him.

Avildsen / Cast: Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Burgess Meredith: The ultimate underdog film stars Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa, a humble boxer in training who will receive his big break when a chance challenge is sent his way. Talia Shire plays Adrian Pennino, his love interest and sister to his best friend. She is shy and works at a pet store while at home she slaves for her unappreciative brother. Burt Young plays Paulie, her brother who works at a meat factory where he has Rocky trading punches with hanging slabs of meat. Carl Weathers plays boxing champion Apollo Creed who issues the challenge when his latest opponent backs out due to an injury. Burgess Meredith plays Mickey, who trains boxers at the gym and takes on Rocky when the challenge is issued. The result is a film with a lot of heart and a protagonist who works hard and has a good heart. Directed by John G. Avildsen who previously won acclaim with Save the Tiger. The climatic boxing match is energizing and brutal but given the appropriate conclusion. This is not about winning the bout but about winning respect for oneself as when Rocky calls out to Adrian because within all the cheers she is the most important thing. This is a film for the hard working underdog who desires to be a winner and has the determination and drive to get there. Score: 10 / 10",

Yeah, there are all the scenes you've seen parodied before -- the training montage with raw eggs and the Philadelphia steps, the big fight at the end, etc. -- but nobody remembers that the bulk of this film is a fairly low-key, working class drama. I mean, most of the first hour is just Rocky hanging around the slums and harassing some pet shop girl. It's a lot more subtle and -- dare I say it? -- intellectual than it gets credit for, and it's also the kind of slow build that you could never get away with in a Hollywood movie today.",

The movie is a straight classic, I love the pacing that is starts off with, a slow, easy to follow pace that lets you know who this protagonist is. He's a relatable character, he has a job, he has a love interest, and a good heart.
The fact that everyone takes Rocky for granted throughout the entire movie and doesn't think much of him doesn't discourage the viewer. I just makes us want to see the character succeed even more than ever. The iconic song ""Gonna Fly Now"" and the iconic race up the Philadelphia steps are just the cherry on top of this treat of a movie. When Rocky succeeds in going the distance, I couldn't help but cry at the ending. Not of sadness, but of happiness. Knowing that he succeeded and won the heart of the woman he loved for so long. Sylvester Stallone clearly knew what he was doing when he made this character.

There might be movie that are more well made or that got better reviews, but considering what Rocky did on the budget that it had, it shoots past all of them. Rocky tells the story of a down and out boxer named Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone. When the Heavyweight Champion of the world, Apollo Creed, , played by Carl Weathers, gives Rocky the chance to fight him in an exhibition fight, he must prove to the world that he isn't a bum, and win the love of Adrian, played by Talia Shire. This is an incredibly inspiring movie, and if you know what Stallone went through to get this made, it makes the movie even better. Watching this today, almost forty years later, it does look a little dated, But so does any old movie. That doesn't make it worse than movies made today. The acting in this film is extraordinary. Stallone gives an emotional and winning performance. Shire is great as an extremely introverted character. Burt Young is good in the movie, even though his character is unlikeable.

Well, maybe because you don't need a complex plot or a dark story conveying the eternal ""everything is crap"" message told in a monotone voice-over, to have a good movie and Rocky is more than a good movie, it is what I would call a ""genuine masterpiece"".",

341,17 September 2015,kocijanemil,10, Recommended!,This old school movie ended up being a start of an amazing franchise. It's been almost a 40 years and it is still alive and kicking and all thanks to the amazing Sylvester Stallone who fought and bled to star in this movie for which he banged up the script in matter of days. Rocky is an amazing movie which kind of reflects on the life of Sylvester Stallone back in the days. Also for any younger generations as myself who didn't get the chance to watch it back in the 70s I would absolutely recommend it. It's a beginning of a franchise you don't really get to see today. This is 2 hours of your life you will never want back because it's worth every single second of watching it.,

And without even realizing it, we're getting a whole lot of character depth during the first half of the film. ",

It is fair to say the series went on to become unrealistic in the extreme and while I have a fondness for parts 2-4 (5 is not good)I honestly believe that the first Rocky movie would be far better thought of without the sequels and the career path that Stallone took.,

The movie's purpose is not showing a boxer's life in details. It's a sad and realistic movie. I don't know how many of you realized that many parts of the movie were like a documentary of the life of an average American and if we cut the whole sport thing, the movie would have been a documentary that make us think and realize how lucky we are. Rocky's life sucked and boxing for him was something more than just hobby or something he likes to do. It's the thing that destroyed the bad thoughts in his mind. He might have seemed stupid and careless about what is going to happen to him, but I don't think so. Haven't you ever met a person who doesn't show he cares about something with facials, actions or words, but he just feels it inside him and he doesn't feel the need to release it. That was Rocky's character and that is why I love that movie. Well one of the many reasons. The supporting characters are wonderful as well and the original Rocky is something not to be forgotten ever while the sequels are just entertaining.

By now, most people know about the behind-the-scenes story that was just as interesting as what happened on the screen:  Sylvester Stallone was a character actor who was having a hard time finding roles.  Till then, his biggest part has been as one of THE LORDS OF FLATBUSH.  With a pregnant wife and little money in the bank, Stallone wrote a screenplay about a down-on-his-luck heavyweight boxer who gets a million-to-one shot at the championship of the world.  When he pitched his story to United Artists, such names as Robert DeNiro, Ryan O'Neal and Burt Reynolds were brought up to play the lead.  But Stallone was adamant about one thing:  Either he played Rocky Balboa or he would destroy the script. The studio relented and a classic was made.",
363,7 August 2019,theterminator-92378,8, The best sports movie ever made and a story about dedication and going the distance,"When people think about sports movies Rocky usually the movie that first comes up in the discussion and rightly so because Rocky is the greatest sports film of all time it has a timeless message and it's a story about how you don't need to win or lose it's about in Rocky's case going the distance against Apollo Creed the heavyweight champion of the world and rocky will do what ot takes to go the distance against Apollo.
The Cast includes Sylvester Stallone {Rocky Ballboa} Talia Shire {Adrian} Burt Young {Paulie} Carl Weathers {Apollo Creed} and Burgess Meredith {Mickey} I can't think of a better cast for this movie Rocky and Adrian's relationship feels so natural and they have some great on screen chemistry and another great relationship is the father/trainer bond between Rocky and Mickey they have some great moments and it shows how Rocky's hardwork and determinaton pay off in the end.
Bill Conti deserves a mention as well for doing the iconic score and theme for the movie and let's face it it is probably the most iconic score of all time because you instantly know that it's Rocky and also the going the distance track is also very good and something that i can listen to casually and still enjoy listening to.
Rocky is iconic it's such a amazing story of a boxer from Philadelphia who is down on his luck but he gets the shot of a lifetime and Rock doesn't want to win and he doesn't care if he loses either it's about going the distance and at the end of the day that's a great message you don'r always need to win and Rock teaches that if you put in effort and you are willing to give it you're all then you are a winner no matter what and that is why Rocky is so great and one of the best sports movies of all time.",

Back when this film was made, there was mostly one boxing champion in each weight division. There was, for example, one middleweight champion, one heavyweight champion. The days of numerous sanctioning bodies each claiming their own champion had not yet come. In this sense it was a matter of PRESTIGE for a fighter to hold a championship. And before the days of guaranteed multi-million dollar contracts, a champion might have taken on ""all comers"" to try and cement his reputation. A case in point would be when Joe Louis fought Tony ""Two Ton"" Galento, a short stout and overweight beer salesman. Galento was a 30-1 underdog although he did manage to knock Louis down before getting cut to ribbons.

I had never heard of Sylvester Stallone and had no expectations or preconceptions other than it was supposed to be a good depiction of boxing. I hated it when I walked out of the theater in 1976, and I hate it even more now. The film is one of sappiest pieces of melodramatic tripe I've ever seen. Every character is a stereotype, and every turn of its derivative, amateurish plot can be anticipated from 50 miles away. Now for the boxing -- a Popeye cartoon has more realistic action. It rivaled the most ludicrous exhibitions staged in professional wrestling matches, and any combatant who endured two minutes of the kind of pummeling depicted in the title fight would be brain dead. My contempt for this trash reached even greater depths when I watched it beat out three outstanding movies -- Network, Taxi Driver, and All the President's Men -- for the best picture Oscar (I've never seen Bound for Glory, but I have no doubt it was also a far better movie than this drivel). I can somewhat understand that a portion of the public would enjoy Rocky, but I can find no excuse for the voting of the Academy members. Shame on them for elevating this sorry excuse for a movie above such worthy contenders. It makes about as much sense as a punch-drunk bar-fighting buffoon landing a title fight with Muhammad Ali.",

Rocky Part I is a great film. This film is infamous. Since that most people have seen this, there are some people that haven't seen this. They need to see this. This is my 9th favorite film ever. Sylvester Stallone was in a few films before this. Starting out with that porno that he did. Rocky is a great film. Best film from 1976. Great film about a boxer. Everyone who has not seen this needs to see this. Rocky Part 1.",

The way he depicted the roles in the movie shows his master piece of work and his another face. And the climax of this movie brings the moviegoers to the corners of the seats with a bit tension of what going to happen next. And after he won the match without showing any signs of victory as a winners would do, he just go out of the ring and calls his lover. And this scene i was really impressed.

399,6 June 2005,David_Frames,7, Only In America,"By law in the UK its compulsory for the Rocky Movies to be shown once every 6 months and so we're all something approaching experts on the Italian Stallion and his best bouts. I therefore humbly offer you the benefit of my country's Balboa expertise. Rocky's one of those movies that's pleasure tends to defy logical scrutiny. On paper its a fairly familiar archetypal inspirational drama about a poor boxer who gets the chance to fight the heavyweight champion of the world in a one-off for America's bicentenary dreamt up as a gimmick by the champ himself, Apollo Creed, to celebrate the countries mantle as the land of opportunity. Fairytale stuff then, except instead of getting to wear pink slippers and marry a prince, Balboa gets to have his brains smashed out in front of a baying for blood crowd. Obviously Rocky, who already looks as though he has brain damage from too many head blows, isn't thought to stand a chance. Creed's the champ after all, he's got all the money, all the experience - it'd be like me picking a fight with Mohammed Ali (in his heyday not now naturally, I'm not a complete bastard) and as Creed puts his feet up and awaits the walkover, the sound of etching can be heard as the Stallion's marble memorial is prepared. Can you see where this going? Of course you can and that's the point. Rocky is old fashioned Hollywood - adversity and long odds conquered by raw guts, determination and heart. It's what America is supposed to be all about and released in 1976 it was barely a shock that the gutter to the stars tale was rewarded with a best picture Oscar. Stallone's titular meathead makes for a likable hero. He may be dumber than a box of rubber swords but the semi-audible lug is a suitably endearing contrast with the arrogant Creed who wins on points (stetching credibility would be left to the sequels) but loses the battle for hearts and minds. If it's supremely entertaining it's because we're all a sucker for this kind of inspirational bilge. Rocky woos the demure object of his affections, runs up steps, trains hard and all to the emotive strings of Bill Conti, who goes a long way to wringing the last shred of cynicism out of the audience. It's never going to feature in your top hundred but Rocky packs a punch and we all know he really won the fight anyway.",

406,3 January 2012,bock_g,10," Oscar bait, clichéd, simple, BUT IT WORKS!!!!","Rocky is without a doubt one of the best American films of all time. The success of this film is not based on the fact it triumphantly won the Best Picture Oscar against great films such as ""Network"" and ""Taxi Driver"", nor how it revived the whole ""underdog"" genre of sports films-- it's the lovable characters. The premise is simple: a local fighter gets a shot at the World Heavyweight title. Rocky is living a near desolate life working as a loan shark for a local mafioso during the day and fighting underground bouts at night. Despite his dodgy appearance, Rocky is a man who has a good moral personality. The subplot in this film is the romance between Rocky and a shy pet store clerk Adrian (Talia Shire). Adrian is an isolated woman treated rather poorly by her brother Paulie (Burt Young)who is Rocky's close friend. One of the best scenes in the film is the dating scene between Rocky and Adrian at an isolated skating rink. It shows how these two characters are complete polar opposites (Rocky is dim-witted but out-going, and Adrian is clever but detached): it's a stereotypical love moment, but it works because we see how much these two characters have developed beyond their assumed social appearances. Another great character in this film is Mickey (Burgess Meredith) who is Rocky's grouchy manager. Mickey is a father figure and mentor who sees Rocky's talent as a boxer, but disapproves of his lifestyle as a loan shark. Another great scene in the film is when Mickey humbly approaches Rocky to be his manager. He talks about how his own boxing career and how it was wasted because he never had a manager. Rocky is reluctant because he was never approached this way for his first few years of his boxing career. He lashes out his ambivalent feelings towards Mickey and eventually accepts his offer. The rest of the film is predictable, Rocky trains hard, he fights, he loses, but eventually triumphs because he was able to go the distance with the Champion toe to toe, and he embraces Adrian at the end. Oscar bait, clichéd, simple, but it works. Not to mention, Bill Conti's amazing score and one of the first uses of the steadicam were also a contributing factor to how great this film is. Sylvester Stallone is constantly labeled by critics and audiences as the macho action star with limited acting skills, but after watching this film, you would believe he is the reminiscent of a young Marlon Brando. His down-to-earth performance and his great screenplay truly earned him the acclaim he got for this film.",
407,2 December 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," Yo, Adrian!","For a low-budget, 'take a chance' type film, 'Rocky (1976)' is pretty accomplished and realistic stuff, with its focus always on building character and setting up an empathetic underdog rather than on overt spectacle (something some of the sequels would go on to struggle with). Some of it has aged quite a bit, though, and the final bout isn't necessarily one of the piece's highlights, even if it certainly works rather well. This isn't a big issue considering that the flick isn't really about the climactic match anyway, but the fact that some of the preceding film is a bit slow and that some of Stallone's dialogue is genuinely hard to decipher is more of a problem. Still, it works well as a grounded character study and, like its hero, it has a lot of heart. 7/10.",

410,16 August 2019,Carrzinho,7, Plucky fighter movie,"Stallone writes and leads in this against all odds boxing drama. Rocky is stubborn, dumb and quite likeable. We get a decent foothold on the character, fighting in run down halls for a few dollars, working for a loan shark but with too much heart for his own good and down on his luck living in a beat up apartment. He's are largely popular figure in his community and desperate to date his friends sister Adrian.
All this is very convincing. The streets look authentic, as do the buildings and the circumstances. There's a lovely innocence to his burgeoning relationship with Adrian and a credibility to the bums that inhabit his world.
Giving a nobody a shot at the title is a bit of a stretch but a scene in Apollo Creeds office largely takes care of that. Later it sets an early bar for what became a ubiquitous montage and sucks you into really rooting for this underdog. The fight scenes are pretty darn good and again sets an early bar. The pacing is good as is the pathos.
However, the characters are fairly one dimensional like walking plot devices and when a character gets heated, they tend to over egg the performance.
At 2 hours it can feel at little sluggish early on but it kinds needs it to labour the mundanity of everyones lives. However, when it hits its stride it really rather zips along and the music is nothing short of inspiring. I really rather like the ending too barely acknowledging the result. SEVEN",

It 's funny because as you get older your taste changes in regards to your likes and dislikes. There were movies years ago I thought were good and now I consider them just OK. This movie, however, still moves me. The musical score is well done and provides emotion to the film. I think the only character that may have been done better is Pauly. Other than that this movie is intense and for a film made in 1976 the fight scenes are done pretty good. If you watch them though, there are flaws chronologically. Example, in the later rounds Rocky has no sweat on him in or bruises on his face or you will see a lot of empty seats in the arena. Just things to pick out. When you do watch this and you get to the part where Apollo Creed is being introduced and he is dressed like George Washington throwing money, you can hear someone laugh as if they were laughing at him.

418,12 March 2018,ket-44107,10, The Legend,"Rocky Movie Review
 I chose do do a movie about a movie series starting off with the first movie, Rocky. I personally selected this movie because it not only portrays a exquisite storyline, but also portrays numerous themes of perseverance and character development. The movie Rocky is about a regular guy named Rocky Balboa, and he does boxing as a hobby to make a little cash. He likes a woman named Adrian who is his friend's sister. However, he knows this trainer named Micky and he's mad at him because Rocky has the potential to be a great boxer but he doesn't use his talent to make himself better. Apollo creed, the heavy weight champion of the world, offered Rocky a shot for the title to prove to the world that anyone can have an opportunity to be great. Rocky took this opportunity and trained with Micky. At the end of the movie, which is the fight between Rocky and Apollo, it was supposed to be one sided for Creed. However, Rocky fights his heart out, knocking down Apollo Creed, giving him a very tough match. At the end, however, Rocky loses and the second movie is the rematch. This movie series has a total of 5 movies highlighting Rocky's boxing career and is still continued to this very day when Rocky is old and training Apollo Creed's son, Adonis Creed. 
 To me, this movie is worth watching because it is knows for being one of the most inspiring movies of all time. It motivated me to start working harder and to believe that anything can be done if you truly put your heart and soul into it. Because of watching Rocky's hard training, it pushed me to start working out harder and even pushing me to be a better person and a stronger student in school. It teaches you how to build yourself up from nothing and no never give up. Rocky once said, ""It's not about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, how much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done! Now if you know what you're worth, than go out and get what you're worth but you gotta be willing to take this hits and stop pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him or her or anybody, cowards do that."" I remember his exact words because I was deeply inspired by what he said and I probably will never forget what he said. Overall, I highly recommend this movie for anyone of all ages. 
 There were many reviews all of them ranging from 2-10 stars. The majority of the reviews for Rocky was 10/10 with a few 9/10 and 8/10. However, I did see a review that rated the movie a 2/10 and it said, ""World's biggest let down? Yes"" I believe the reason for that is because Rocky was defeated at the end of the first movie, but I am positive that if that user were to watch the rest of the movie series, he or she would be incredibly happy to see that Rocky was victorious at the end. This demonstrates the many individuals who treasure the original movie and it's artistry to portray self development and determination.
 Although there may be a few people out there who do not like the movie a Rocky, starring Sylvester Stallone, I truly do believe that this is the greatest movie to ever exist. Like my mother said, Rocky isn't just a boxer, he is an inspiration and a great role model to all. Encouraging individuals to never give up and to chase their dreams proves to be a great way to inspire others. Not only that, Rocky is a clean person as well. He treats Adrian and his friends so well that it makes me want to be like that to other people. The way he never gives up in his fight makes me a stronger person, wanting to be just like him and never give up when life seems to be getting too hard. Rocky had a broken nose, broken ribs, one eye swollen shut, out of breath and border line dying but yet he still found the will power to push through all that adversity. Overall, I highly recommend this movie as is has won numerous rewards and nominees and is still known till this very day as one of the greatest movies to ever exist.",

However, I wasn't all that impressed with the majority of the movie. The storyline is pretty simple, but spends way too much time on boring side stories and secondary characters. The scenes with Adrian's brother are boring and unnecessary, and he's crazy. The first half of the movie is rocky trying to hook up with Adrian, then about 2/3 in he actually focuses on boxing.

He's not annoying but not really likeable..... just strange. Adrien has no real development and is kinda boring. And Paulie is an unlikeable ass hat. Rocky's trainer is fine but he's barely in the film. But I did like Apollo, though he was barely in it, the actor was quite charismatic. And there are at least 3 plot elements introduced in the beginning that don't really go anywhere. I'll say the movie has 2 really good scenes in the 3rd act. There's the scene where he finally climbs those stairs, (you know the scene), and the final fight was actually quite good, and so the film goes out on a high note.

The truth is Stallone is a good actor and rocky is a brilliant film, not many films can get an audience so emotional and Rocky does it without making an audience sad and make them cry but makes everybody in an audience jump up out of there seats and cheer, also not many other films use music so well, well done Bill Conti this has to be one of the best film scores in film history.

And four sequels later, it may be easy to forget ROCKY'S roots.  But this gentle tale of an Italian southpaw from the Philadelphia slums is worth returning to.  An old fashioned story about the potential for every underdog to achieve greatness.  Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay in only ten days, when he was little more than a bit performer in low budget films, and its success led him to become one of the most recognized movie stars in the world.  His quiet unassuming portrayal of the Italian Stallion, an innocent boxer who gets a shot at the heavyweight title of the world is always intensely moving.  A film that is both edgy and sensitive at the same time, ROCKY is every guy's STEEL MAGNOLIAS.  And for anyone who's had to fight for what they believe in, it is guaranteed to draw a tear.",

What moved me most about it was not the fighting, not his ""ugliness"" that some people say makes it more realistic and easier to related to; my favorite aspect of Rocky was the transformation the girl Adrian makes throughout the movie, her character, her look, her whole self. This, I believe, was what Stallone truly wanted to point out, even if he didn't admit to the tabloids - I think he wanted to say to the world that it's not the beautiful, extroverted women who truly deserve attention at times, but women like Adrian who live quiet, but shaky, mistreated lives and don't allow themselves to be heard. Realizing this throughout the movie put tears in my eyes, I won't even hide it. The reason this movie deserves Best Picture I think is because it focuses on the more positive human traits - love, honor, respect, etc, unlike Taxi Driver. No matter what movie I see about crime in whatever shape, I'm never left with the heartwarming feel I got from Rocky. And I guess the media agrees with me: look at the movies that Hot Shots - the 'mother of all movies' - chose to allude to to show a true love memento - Rocky, Superman, and... Lolita, was it? Anyway, the part when she rushes over to him after the fight was a huge climax that summed everything up superbly. I even expected that it would be her doing that that would get him to win, because that would've increased the voltage of the scene many times over, I think.",

The way over the top slugfests in ROCKY lend the character an almost comic-book aspect (which suited the character well in later movies, when he faced everybody from Rocky, Junior- played by Tommy Morrison- to Godzilla- played by ""Hulk"" Hogan). Stallone would base yet another of his ROCKY movies (III) on the shenanigans of Ali (against giant Japanese professional wrestler Antonio Inoki) and Wepner (versus Andre the Giant). Stallone's debt to both Ali and Wepner is something that the star only begrudgingly admits (though it's crystal clear to anyone with at least one working eye).

To know that this production was not only in on film, but also in real life, a ""win or lose"" project for the then unknown Sylvester Stallone only makes this film more lovable. It tells the story of a unknown prize fighter who doesn't really have a life worth envying. Suddenly he gets his big chance when the world champion seeks a new challenger, as the challenger he had has to bail out, due to an injury. Rocky goes for it, but in the end he knows he's not in the same league as the champ. The true victory is Rocky's new gains self respect and love for his girlfriend Adrian. This film has a really cool 70's vibe and for me the locations use (Philadelphia) fit the film perfect. It was filmed during winter 1976 and that's something you can actually see. The true realism and great acting performances (plus the unforgettable soundtrack) makes this a film worthwhile. A must see definitely!! My favourite scene is still the one where Rocky goes out for his first morning run. He gets up at 4 A.M. and sets out into the cold, frozen streets of morning hour Philadelphia. The mood, music and the winterish landscape of a city frozen up are brought to the screen with such a transparant touch.. It still chi lls my skin everytime I watch it!

A chick flick that the guys will like, because it's so strong. You feel for Rock when he yells at Mickey in his apartment. You feel Rocky's pain when he can't even run up those famous steps in Philly. The most powerful scene in the film, is the Gonna Fly Now segment.

Putting it below 200 is just ridiculous. It has superb acting, a great story, and a phenomenal iconic following. Also, it can relate to anybody because everybody has been the underdog at one point. Maybe not the greatest sports movie of all time (I'd give that one to ""Raging Bull"") but it is the film that everybody references and spoofs. Featuring so many classic moments (eating the raw eggs, pounding the meat, etc.), its the typical underdog story that was made before it was typical. Every other story or film made nowadays involving somebody being the underdog is just a child of this film and how powerful and moving it is. In my opinion, the silly sequels (mainly 3, 4 and 5) have given this film a bad name and a bad reputation. Definitely a pure cinematic masterpiece, Rocky also won 3 Oscars, including Best Picture, which many of the films that are ahead of it on this list haven't even came close to. One reason why this film is great is because it came from Sly's heart (he had a struggling life and this film was his million to one shot, quite possibly one of the reasons why this is one of the few films he acts well in).

Nobody gave Wepner a chance; everyone thought Ali would knock him in less than 3 rounds.

From the opening shots of the grittiness of where Rocky is living, Rocky is a sports drama that will never be forgotten. Everything about Rocky seems real; the characters, the locations, the drama, the boxing match, everything in Rocky seemed extremely realistic. Sylvester Stallone gives a very convincing and incredible performance as Rocky, very real and very believable. No wonder why Roger Ebert declared Stallone as ""the next Marlon Brando"" back in the day. While Stallone is definitely no Brando in today's time, Rocky makes Marlon Brando feel like a chicken.

468,13 December 2010,moorepiper,8, Determination shows victorious.,"Sylvester Stallone plays the main character, ""Rocky"". Rocky is a local boxer only known to neighborhood residents and boxers at the local gym. He is an amateur with strong determination. Rocky was given the opportunity to fight heavyweight champ Apollo Creed, played by Actor Carl Weathers, known to be the best of the best. In accepting the challenge the underdog became the champ. Rocky believed in himself and conquered his dream. He stayed the course, stayed focused and never gave up. Unrealized to Rocky, the reason that he was not moving forward in accomplishing his dream prior to the Apollo challenge, was that he had no strategy and no proper training. He was never properly managed, just a man with a passion and a dream. When the manager from the gym Rocky attended learned of his opportunity to fight Apollo he asked Rocky if he could manage him. He knew Rocky had the potential to be a great boxer. He also knew that Rocky did not understand how to improve on the talent he already had. This task was now Mickey's (Burgess Meredith) responsibility. Through the course of the movie Rocky falls in love with Adrian Pennino (Actress Talia Shire) after pursuing her for a very long time, she eventually became his roommate. Paulie Pennino, played by Burt Young is Rocky's best friend and Adrian's brother. Paulie was very adamant about Andrian getting out of the house and enjoying life before she ""dried up"". After successfully forcing Adrian to go out with Rocky, Paulie's actions caused the two to become roommates. Everything Paulie did to and for Adrian was out of love and concern. The music in the movie is the greatest technique used. Sylvester Stallone became Rocky in this 1976 movie. To this day, there are certain songs that can be played and the first thing that comes to my mind is ""Rocky"". Throughout the movie the music and sound placed strong emphasis on Rocky's emotions and where he was at that point in his career. The music drew me emotionally into the characters and the movie as a whole. The lighting and angles were very impactful and worked together throughout the movie.The lighting created a sense of poverty in Rocky's neighborhood and within his home. The angles contributed to the effects of the lighting even as we watched Adrian's body language as she was a lady of very few words. Rocky is definitely a movie that shows that love will conquer fear, determination will conquer adversities and dreams do come true.",

The acting is top notch all-around, even from Stallone, who is considered the king of Razzies. Everyone knows the story. It's about a down on his luck Philadelphia boxer who is given a title shot by the respected and beloved heavy weight champion of the world. The boxer manages to go the distance, and manages to get the girl. Predictable and clichéd storyline? To a certain extent, yes, but it's the characters that draw you in. Each and every one of them you get to know well, and you feel for them, even Apollo Creed, who is not made out to be a villain, but more a man with lots of pride who's on top of the world and has nothing else left to prove. The ending of this movie does hurt the argument that the movie is entirely predictable. Rocky does go the distance, but he gets beat up pretty bad, and loses the fight. It's the perfect ending to go with, and in a way elevates it above the predictable and clichéd tag this movie gets labeled with.

We were both underdogs. Great movie aside, Rocky is one of the all-time best characters ever to be imagined and Stallone brought him to life perfectly. I have always wanted to meet Sly just to thank him for inspiring me with the confidence to do things I never thought I could do. See there was this neighborhood bully who used the beat the crap out of me just about every day and I never even fought back, it just wasn't my style. So one day my Grampa takes me to see Rocky and I was like ""Hey, I could fight back too, I could be like Rocky."" Even though that kid was bigger and older the next time he came at me I just pretended I was Rocky. And guess what? I beat the crap out of him that day and he never touched me again. I was one of the most liberating things that I have ever done in my life. I sometimes wonder how different of a person I may have been had I not seen Rocky and been inspired to stand up for myself. Would I have been a wimp all my life? I don't know. But what I do know is that seeing Rocky at that age and during that time was very formative and inspiring for me and my character. So thank you Gramps, even though I never got to tell ya, and thank you too Sly, you were both my heroes.",

Stallone's performance is as his character's punches in the ring. This one of the most exciting action movies ever made, if you haven't seen it, what have you been doing with your life. :D :D :D This is the film that catapulted Sylvester Stallone into the international spotlight and launched one of the most successful series of films in movie history.

481,4 January 2021,ryleereiter,10, Monday Movie Memories,"Of all the films that I've seen in my lifetime, no movie surpasses ""Rocky"" (1976), in character development and story quality. ""Rocky"" is not a popular movie to review in my social circles, because a lot of my friends do not care for sports. First of all, this is hardly simply a movie about boxing. In fact, I would imagine boxing professionals would scoff at the Hollywood approach taken by Avildsen in representing their sport. The truth is, that this movie is about persevering through extreme adversity, the influences of life choices, taking advantage of opportunity, and love. Thanks to Stallone's ground breaking performance, I know I'm not going to let my flat feet and bowed legs stop myself from enjoying my body. Now go revisit this film before you end up kicking it on the street corner with Marie.",

Beautifully acted by Sylvester Stallone (sadly to say one of his only few great performances) and Talia Shire as Adrian his love interest. Rocky gets a perfect score in my book and is to date the best Boxing movie of all time. Now if you have never seen this movie before that is a shock and I beg you please go out and watch it and you will be sure to love every moment.",

I remembered it as a sentimental tale which robbed other greater movies of the Oscar in 1976. I was wrong. It works on every level. It is a gritty movie that earns it's place alongside the other classics of the seventies. The relationship between Paulie and his sister is brilliantly done. Life has been unkind to all the central characters between dead end jobs, poor living conditions and alcohol. They all realise their dreams have been trampled on, but they trying to get on with life. The only character with money is a local gangster. Then Rocky gets a break. From then on, the film builds to a climax taking in doubt, faith, love, confrontation and hope along the way. It really is a wonderful film. Watch it again and listen to that soundtrack.",

He wanted to show everybody that he had the potential to become the greatest fighter and wasn't just another bum from the neighbourhood. This movie truly inspires me and millions of other people around the world. ""Never give up"". This movie boosted my confidence and encouraged me to follow my dreams. The other rocky sequels are awesome as well. I think if someone is about to give up something and he watches this movie, he would definitely stand up and follow his dreams.

Back in 1976 and even today Rocky was and should continue to be looked upon as not only groundbreaking, but also as a truly landmark moment in western cinema. I don't merely hyperbole either, because Rocky was the first of it's kind; it was the movie that created an archetype. The underdog story, in which a million-to-one shot gets his one chance at stardom and overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to top the world, is now, an all too familiar tale, but back in 1976 this type of tale, one that captured the very essence of the American dream had never before been brought to the big screen. It was the first of what was now to become a genre of it's own; it was innovation at it's finest.",
495,25 September 2015,Toni9434,10, We are all outsiders,"What to say about this movie? This is one of the best pictures ever made. Stallone (who also wrote film's screenplay) stars as Rocky Balboa, small time boxer who is living in a small apartment infested with roaches and almost always doesn't have money for that same apartment. He doesn't like his job (working for loan sharks) and (like all of us) dreams of something better. He boxes every night because that is the only constant thing in his life. Also, every single day he tries to impress 'the girl' Adrian (played by Talia Shire), but all his attempts ends unsuccessfully. But, everything will change when heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (played by Carl Weathers) pick him for his next opponent. Apollo is doing that because he knows that Rocky does not have what it takes to beat him. He believes that will easily defend the champion's belt, but he doesn't know that Rocky isn't just some guy, some loser... Oh, no... He is a fighter, he never backs down. This is his only chance to do something with his life, to do something great... And, how many punches he must receive to do this, he will endure till the end. This movie is a 'must-watch' because it tells the story of an outsider who is nothing most of his life and who is never getting a chance to do anything right. But, when he does... Will he use it? Also, you must watch this movie because Stallone give's us one of the best performances in a lifetime, before he went to do some really, really bad action and comedy movies. All in all, this is a 'classic' with some memorable performances (including Burt Young and Burgess Meredith) and story that all generations can understand.",

This is a good depiction of the typical American rags to riches story. Rocky develops feelings and pursues a pet shop worker by the name of Adrian (Talia Shire) and we watch their relationship grow as the movie progresses. Rocky is given a shot at the title of world heavyweight champion when the reigning heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) challenges him to a fight. The purpose of the fight was to give an unknown boxer a shot against the champion. Rocky accepts the challenge and begins his famous training regime leading up to the legendary running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The much anticipated boxing match takes place on New Year's Day in an arena full of spectators. The fight is long and very intense lasting the entire 15 rounds, and both boxers are pretty badly beaten up. Once the fight ends, everyone pretty much goes wild as this was one of the most entertaining fights in history. The winner is finally announced with Creed named the winner by virtue of a split decision. ",

Rocky is certainly one of the most inspiring films for me. Demonstrating that with focus you can reach your best possible version to reach your goals. At the beginning of the film we can see Rocky's personal life. We know some of his principles in the conversation he has with Marie, we meet the people in his social circle next to his romantic home Adrian, we are also presented with Apollo Creed, and his interest in fighting with Rocky Balboa. Throughout the development of the film (2nd act), all the characteristics of the 1st act are more in-depth and very well constructed. In Act 3 we have the whole process of training Rocky for his big fight against Apollo Creed and obviously, we see the fight of these legends. In general, Rocky is a great film, totally inspiring and beautiful. His photography is very beautiful, interpretations are good and great plot.",

A man on his 29th birthday received $200 dollars if I can remember. He spent half on his birthday needs and wants, and he took the rest to see a fight between Wepner and Ali. That man was Sylvester Stallone. That night he went home and wrote the story of his own life, although some sites will tell you otherwise he really based it off his own life. He had taken his picture down to agencies and people turned him down. One time he even erupted throwing furniture around the room because he didn't get the fight. He had had previous movies but they were not successful. He said that if Rocky didn't make any money all hope was lost. Nobody wanted Sly to play Rocky. Stars were looked at such as James Caan and Ryan O'Neal. But Rocky said he would play the part or he wouldn't do it at all. What followed was a movie phenomenon. Sylvester never imagined it would go as well as it did. This movie is perfect if you want a good story. I has a story of gentle, sweet, and wonderful love between Rocky and the shy pet shop Adrian. It has the meaning of getting self-respect by competing for the title of the heavy weight champion of the world and lasting the 15 rounds, thereby going the distance. This is a great family film. Other than the hanky-panky between Rocky and Adrian and the bloody images of Rocky, this movie is great for the young ones. So what are you waiting for?

504,3 June 2023,CinemaSerf,7, Rocky,"Sylvester Stallone is ""Rocky"", an enforcer for a small-time Philadelphia mobster who works out in Burgess Meredith's gym (""Mickey's"") and is keen on the sister of his friend ""Paulie"" (Burt Young), the shy and retiring ""Adrian"" (Talia Shire). Meantime, World Heavyweight Champion ""Apollo Creed"" (Carl Weathers) finds his impeding tilte defence kybsoshed by an injured challenger. At this point serendipity takes a hand and ""Creed"" decides to pluck a challenger from obscurity - and he chooses the ""Italian Stallion"". What follows is a solid, engaging tale of grit and determination as the champion assumes it's all in the bag and together with his tight-knit team, the challenger is focussed and determined to, at least, go the distance. Sure, Stallone isn't an actor in any traditional sense - he is more of a character, he oozes the part rather then portrays it - and that is what makes this work. You are subsumed into his life, his love, his training and his ambition - almost as the then aspiring Stallone would have been whilst writing and making the film. The action scenes are first class, and the charisma offered by the star, and by trainer Meredith help this stand the test of time well. There are holes in the plot - but they are fairly easy to overlook if you allow the sentiment and strong performances to take and keep hold of your imagination. Great stuff.",

What I thought would be a standard sports movie ended up being an incredibly well told and wonderfully acted underdog story that has strongly inspired and uplifted me during the hardest times of my life. Sylvester Stallone has appeared in more bad movies than good, but Rocky is up there with his best. Rocky is a surprisingly endearing character, he's tough, not too well-spoken and a little dumb, but he's kind-hearted, loves animals and doesn't demand for much outside of not being seen as a bum. The other characters are excellent too: Adrian, Paulie, Mickey and Apollo Creed are blissfully cast and compliment Rocky well, they all have an important place in the story and the movie simply wouldn't work without them. Many think of Stallone as another generic action movie star, but to me, he's not John Rambo, Barney Ross, Judge Dredd or The Toymaker. He's the guy who inadvertently might've saved my life with this excellent film. He is Rocky.",

Rock was a 1976 motion picture starring and written by Sylvester Stallone who is a great actor, but does not always choose the best movies. The story is about a boxer named Rocky Balboa who is a man of heart but when he is in the ring, he is a ferocious gorilla. Rocky is given a one-shot opportunity for the world title by the champion himself Apollo Creed. Now with a chance of a life time, Rocky needs help from former boxer and trainer Mickey and the support of his girlfriend Adrian to rise up to the challenge and take the guts and glory.

516,8 October 2018,tarasmaluk,10, Rocky Review - Classic Movie,"Rocky is a movie that was made in 1976. The movie is about a man named Rocky Balboa. Rocky is from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He is a debt collector and a boxer. In his boxing career, his nickname is the Italian Stallion. Rocky is very poor in the beginning of the movie because his boxing career isn't taking off. Soon, things start to look up for Rocky as he is chosen to take on the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed. Apollo uses Rocky to make himself look better, to make a ""nobody"" into a ""somebody."" Apollo uses Rocky for viewers. He knows he's going to win right off the bat, but Apollo doesn't realize that Rocky is taking the fight seriously. This can be his only shot at the big leagues. Therefore, Rocky acquires a trainer named Mickey Goldmill. Mickey is a feisty old man, who believes in Rocky, but knows Rocky has to put in a lot of work to win this fight. He tests and pushes Rocky to his limit. Rocky trains extremely hard for this match. Later in the movie, Rocky and Apollo have their boxing match. 
 At this time in the movie, Rocky is smitten with a woman named Adrian. Adrian and her brother Paulie are there to watch the fight. Apollo is taken by surprise when Rocky, The Italian Stallion, comes into the ring ready to fight. They fight until the fifteenth round. Apollo Creed had said he would knock Rocky out in the second round, but Rocky has just proved him wrong. The judges chose Apollo Creed as the winner, but it was a difficult decision. Apollo doesn't understand how Rocky was able to make it this far. Now, Rocky has his chance as a boxer. He starts to get in more professional boxing matches, and is now making a lot of money. Rocky continues to fight throughout the Rocky series, continuing to the movies II,III,IV, and, V.
 Overall, the first Rocky movie had received 93% in rotten tomatoes, and a high review score on other websites. I believe the Rocky movie was thrilling and heart-wrenching. Although, at times, Rocky is very difficult to understand. I love sitting down and watching this movie with my family. You feel like a part of this movie. The struggle Rocky endures, the preparation to the fight, the awesome soundtrack, and watching him make his way to the big leagues. You feel the adrenaline and hope Rocky does. The actors portray the characters accurately and immensely. They make you feel the struggle, the love, the hate, the hard work and dedication. Rocky is truly a fantastic movie. 
 Also, with the movie being made in the 1970s, the effects are great. The sound effects, noises, bruises, etc. It is a high quality movie for it being made over decades ago. The camera angles are fantastic, and the soundtrack is just amazing. It gives you that adrenaline feeling. It's a very high quality movie. It's one of my family favorites. 
 The number one thing I enjoy about this movie is the message. The message of the movie is you can do anything as long as you put your mind and dedicate yourself to it. Even if people doubt you, or thing you're a joke, you can always prove them wrong. You can start anywhere. You can do it. This is movie has such a strong, emotional message. You can prove the people who doubt you that they were and are wrong. It shows you may not have a lot of people in your corner, but you can still succeed. One of Rocky's problems were because he was getting older. New boxers were coming in, and they were better than Rocky. Rocky didn't let that stop him. It doesn't matter your age, your education, or if people doubt you. You can do whatever you set your mind too. Rocky does such a fantastic job portraying that message. This is one of my all time favorite movies. It's a classic, heart-warming, emotional movie. I highly recommend if anyone has not taken the time to sit down and watch this movie. You're missing out. It's great.",

I watched it over the weekend again and it is always a good decision. Now getting well into my 30's it holds an even closer appeal to me. The acting, the story, the music... the raw Philadelphia backdrop...quite possibly the perfect movie. Stallone would never be this textured again. Too bad his legacy has become diluted with Rhinestone and Stop or My Mom Will Shoot, or even Rocky V. Can't say that I'm looking forward to the sixth installment of the Rocky franchise, but I won't let that take away from this great film. This needs to be in the IMDb top 250, in fact, it's just plain ridiculous that it's not.

520,27 December 2006,jacksenvy,10, Rocky: The Greatest,"I think Frank Capra said it all when after having seen the film, he said ""Now there is a film I wish I had made"" Rocky manages to be wholly realistic, and utterly uplifting. Performances from the leads right down to the minor supporting players are beautifully realised. It is very easy to see why Stallone was touted as the next Brando after this movie. His acting ability, delivery, and physicality are all reminiscent of the great man himself. Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, and of course Burgess Meredith are all wonderful. They take an already great screenplay and make it better by adding nuance, layers, and idiosyncrasies to their characters without trying to hog the picture. Whenever any of these actors appear on screen, it is like they are the star, and the movie could be about them. But let us not forget Stallone. He is the lynch pin around which the movie revolves. An acting style so natural you'd swear that it was a documentary. A movie that makes what should be unlikeable characters lovable, because you understand them. It is no wonder Stallone continued to revisit these characters a further five times. A truly great movie, that stands shoulder to shoulder with any other movie ever made.",

In my opinion this movie is about a hopeless loser with a heart of gold who cant catch a break except for his nose, pounding away in back alley brawls Rocky survives on meagre penny pinched purses and moonlights as a debt collector in a Cowardly Lion fashion. His best friend is a drunken bully with a society suppressed sister who would jump at her own shadow but these peoples domestic woes will start a chain of events that will change Rocky's life forever. A chance of a lifetime, a boxers dream bout lands on Rocky's lap when the CHAMP wants to make an example of somebody, Only Rocky is to punchy to except, Only Rocky is to sluggish to refuse, Only Rocky has the heart to stand toe 2 toe with the best and when this movie climaxes it really packs a punch.....Enjoy the movie its a debateable gem created entirely by a loser on the edge who catches a big break when he throws his hat in the ring.....highly recommended.",

Avildsen's and Sylvester Stallone's Rocky... The film revolves around a neighborhood bum and boxer Rocky who talks to two turtle and a fish in his stinking house... He fights and works for a rookie Gazzo and collects money for him... He goes to a pet shop where he loves a girl named Adrian irrespective of her geek looks and her age.. He goes there to crack a joke in front of her to make her laugh.. Nothing is working out in his life.. he lost his locker in his boxing club that he used for six years to a new boxer.. his neighborhood thinks he is a dumb guy.. He has one friend Paulie(Adrian's brother) who nags in front of Rocky to take him to Gazzo for a job... Things changed from the night Rocky takes Adrian out on a Thanksgiving date when world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed's contender got injured and there was nobody who could take the place within 5 weeks... Apollo got interested in Rocky by his boxing name that was The Italian Stallion... Rocky was selected as his opponent.. He got his manager and he devoted himself in training... his unique style of training included punching dead and raw meat in the meat house... Adrian was his shadow helping him in each and every step to rise to the podium... Before the night of the match Rocky says Adrian that he knows he will not be able to defeat Apollo as the match is fixed... But he wants to go to the distance and when the final bell rings he wants to stand there and raise his hand... After the 15th and the final round bell Rocky stands and calls out for Adrian which shows his passion for the game and his love.... Rocky is a once in a lifetime movie that you can watch over and over again... Sylvester Stallone shaped the character right from the first scene to the last... His shadow boxing while walking, his way of cracking jokes his love towards animals, everything blows your mind... Well in short even after 37 years of the Apollo Creed and Rocky match we see and we cheer Rocky's every moves....",

In this fight, everyone said that Chuck Wepner would last 2, maybe 3 rounds at most. What actually happened was chuck Wepner was knocked out in the last 20 seconds of the 15th and final round, even managing to knock Ali down in the 9th round. Stallone was so impressed and inspired by this, he decided to write a script about a lone underdog who gets a shot at the title.

Rocky has a potential to motivate people to lift, work hard and finally achieve a great result. Slyvester Stallone, in his own production, has done a very good job at being a tough and motivated prizefighter. The soundtrack within this film is also cleverly made which suits the emotional aspects of this film.

543,4 March 2012,twk00,9, Hollywood at its best.,"Before Stallone diluted the brand with a series of increasingly ridiculous sequels before finally bringing the franchise back to respectability with ""Rocky Balboa"" there was this little film which is a fine example of the Hollywood formula executed to perfection. The classic underdog tale combines the gritty realism of the 1970's, with the uplifting story of a down on his luck boxer who gets the chance of a lifetime when he gets a shot at the World Championship. At its core ""Rocky"" is really a touching love story and working class drama featuring great performances by all the principles (Stallone has never been better) and great direction by John G. Avildsen who won an Oscar for his work. Stallone's screenplay hits all the right notes and it is impossible not to be fully invested in the story by the time the emotional climax hits. There are scenes in this film that left their mark in film history and the film became an inspiration to people around the world. The only downside was that Stallone decided to cash in his characters popularity and made 5 sequels that had varying levels quality. Rocky 2 was entertaining but unnecessary, while Rocky 4 was so utterly ridiculous that the movie has become nothing but an entertaining joke. It's best to forget the sequels because the original is truly a classic example of Hollywood cinema at its absolute best.",

I owe it all to Rocky Balboa..Although Rocky is a fictional character his spirit and essence lives in all of us..When you think he is down and out or defeated for the last time he gets up and keeps going win or lose..winning or losing is never an issue Rocky..but getting to the finish line with honor and bravery is..His character has inspired a whole generation and maybe the next to keep up the good fight!!

If you've never seen it, you should know going in that is not really a boxing movie per se; it's more of a tale about overcoming adversity with a sprinkle of a love story, and boxing as a backdrop. The fact that this was also Stallone's gamble that would either make him successful or break him can be felt through the whole script that he wrote himself.

Eventhough some may find the story building boring, I don't. This movie gets the highest possible rating in my opinion.",

581,17 May 2021,Maxence_G,5, Review - Rocky,"There is so much wrong with this film, starting with the poor collaboration between the directing and the screenplay. Both don't fit, they don't depict the same thing, John G. Avildsen appropriately depicts sports sequences, training sequences in the way that he does in The Karate Kid, but he doesn't understand the nuances. The most important one is that Rocky is prima facie a melodramatic film. And, maybe that I'm too harsh on him, maybe it is the fault of Stallone who did the same mistake on First Blood, but anyway, I don't like it.",
582,25 August 2006,ranjm7-1,10," Go Rocky, Go!!","Rocky is one of the best films that have ever screened. To my taste it is far more better than ""Taxi driver"", ""Godfather"", ""Titanic"" or ""Forest Gump"". Stallone changed the Hollywood movie industry by doing the film. I think Stallone still can make award winning films like Rocky (not Rocky or Rambo sequel). Rocky film, character and Sly him self were icons which reflected American culture to world. Asian and African countries knew America as Rocky and Rambo in 1970s,1980s and 90s. I don't know why this film was not in the top 250 movies list while such bad films like ""Pirates of Carribian"" are in the list. You may think who am I to judge and to criticize. Anyway I hope Sly and Rocky will stay in the highest peak of the history of Hollywood.",
583,8 October 2006,joepc3,10, Rocky-Always and Forever a Winner!!!,"The Greatest underdog story in cinematic history, Rocky is a true tale of an underdog story where even with a million to one shot there is still a chance. I have watched this movie hundreds of times and it still moves me to this day. Maybe the greatest things to come out of this movie was introducing the world to one of the most underrated genius's of the Hollywood culture, Slyvester Stallone. This was a man who lived the rocky story in real life. Growing up in hells kitchen, this man was born to write, and for that matter star in the wonderful franchise. It is the story of Philadelphia club fighter Rocky Balboa who lives paycheck to paycheck fighting in small churches and crumby gymnasiums at night and working the streets as a collector to second rate lone shark tony gazzo. His shot comes the day the undated and unstoppable champ, appolo creed gives an underdog club boxer a shot at the biggest title in the sport. What comes after that is a story of passion, love, fight and the power to dream the impossible dream. I cant wait for December 22 the day this storied franchise, my favorite thing in the world, rocky, hits the theaters for one more round!!!!",

This movie was truly Stalone's swan song! The only reason we know the name Sylveter Stalone today is due to his authorship of ""Rocky"". This movie is an inspirational gem! It shows us all that is good within even the dullest exterior. The possibility of duality and complexity of characters without great intelligence. The lacking of a realistic plot is made up for by the purity of character depicted in Rocky Balboa. This movie carried with it a message that needed to hit home within the inner city population's of America. The time period was crying for a hero, and Rocky certainly delivered. A feel good 4 star story of heart overcoming steep odds! Without the love story, this is Still the greatest boxing movie of it's age. However the love story brings SOP much to the overall enjoyment of the film as well as the complexity of Rocky's character.",

589,19 April 2017,sullymazda,3," While not intentional,a film's whose effects ended up being irresponsible","I'm glad to see that each of this motion picture's detractors here showed the guts enough...even on the Web, where there usually (and hopefully) is little threat of immediate face to face confrontation. The film, if one characterizes it as less than even merely mediocre, generates more arguments than it does healthy discussion.There is rarely an occasion where one can even attempt to tone down the other person's strident tone by discussing one of the movie's precious few merits. To its credit, the production credits are top notch. Talia Shire's performance was worthy of an Oscar nomination, it is for the most part well directed (until, ironically, the final scene) and... and that's about it. Even the very theme song itself was one where people wanted to stomp you if you said you didn't care for it. The recording somehow manages to be not only bombastic, it is threatening at the same time (actually, a bit of an accomplishment). It defies you dislike it. And finally, while there are some iconic images in it...(particularly, the poster) some of those are still of short of merit. It is my understanding that in Philadelphia, there is some sort of monument to the title character jumping for joy on top of the lengthy steps. There's only one problem with that...the man never existed. So not only is it unwise, the tribute doesn't even particularly make sense.",
590,1 May 2010,misassistant,10, The perfect movie that originally came out at the perfect time,"First, allow me to bat aside the cynics who now disparage this masterpiece of a movie by pointing out that - in the full context of the time in the U.S. when it was released - this was exactly the kind of movie we immediately were ready to fall in love with. Rewind back to 1976, post-Watergate, the Arab oil embargo, deep recession, the Soviet Union on the march, and the era that saw the invention of the terms ""malaise,"" ""misery index,"" and ""stagflation."" To make matters worse, all this economic and foreign policy decline was occurring on the bicentennial of our nation's founding. Along comes a movie about a lowly amateur boxer who earns just enough to pay for his hovel of a Philadelphia apartment as a ""collection agent"" for a loan-shark, using his menacing size as the ""penalty"" for debtors slow to pay back their loans and gigantic interest. Yes, it's the classic underdog story, and yet Stallone - who both wrote the script and played the starring role - and director John Aldiss somehow managed to craft a movie that allows the audience to fall into believing the story and cheering enthusiastically to the end. Incredibly, they managed to produce this movie for a grand total of one million dollars, a shoestring budget by even the standards of the time, and somehow that only added to the realism. This movie also saw - for the first time in a major film - the use of a brand new technological innovation: the Steadycam That particular innovation greatly enhanced the illusion that the audience is literally running alongside Stallone as he runs through the seedy neighborhoods of Philadelphia, getting in shape for the big fight with the Heavyweight Champion, Apollo Creed. It turns out that the set they used for Stallone's apartment was not really a set at all, but in fact a genuinely shabby hole. There is litter in the streets, too, and that only enhances the point that this is a real nobody trying to show that he can be a somebody. There is also a love interest in this movie, played perfectly by Talia Shire as Adrian. When Stallone first sees her, she is a dowdy young woman wearing hideous cat lady glasses, frumpy clothes, and (worst of all) a gray wool watch cap. She is also extremely shy and reluctant to respond to Rocky's affections. Somehow Rocky sees through through all that, and (later) also shows that Adrian is in fact a strikingly beautiful woman. As Rocky courts Adrian, Heavyweight Champ Apollo Creed (played brilliantly by Carl Weathers) is growing bored with the routine nature of selecting his next challenger. Creed takes the daring (and very smart) move of deciding to do something radical by offering an unknown the chance to fight him for a shot at the title. Creed knows that this will only draw more fans because of its unusual nature, plus he is cocky enough to believe that the challenger will be a cinch to defeat. Rocky at first does not want to do this, since he senses what is really going on, plus he also realizes that he is being used as a prop for a kind of publicity stunt. However, he also realizes what this would mean for him, and retired trainer Mickey (the role of a lifetime from the great Burgess Meredith) talks him into it, with himself as the trainer. Mickey himself had boxed quite a bit in his youth, never quite reaching the big time, and he sees in Rocky the opportunity for both of them to reach it. The story progresses from there, Rocky at first in agony as he struggles to run even a short distance, the Bill Conti soundtrack expertly conveying the lonely pain of an out of shape contender. Later, under Mickey's instruction and with confidence building, the soundtrack becomes upbeat with the now familiar ""Gonna Fly Now"" propelling it along. As all this happens, it really is hard to remember that this is only a movie, and the final ten minutes are some of the finest in movie history. I will not spoil this for those who have never seen it, except to say that the ending is absolutely perfect, and I am unembarrassed to admit that even now I get a bit misty when I see it. Again, getting back to the context of the time that this movie was released, I suspect that if this movie had come out in 1996 instead of 1976, it might not have gained the iconic status it now enjoys. Yes, it's true, the story of Rocky nicely mirrors that of America as a whole, and that makes it all the more appealing. And I don't care if I get derided as some kind of flag waver for having written that. If you have not had the chance to see this movie, you owe it to yourself to grab a copy and watch. Another point that should be mentioned is that this is neither a guy flick nor a chick flick, but instead a perfect blend. It's terrific to watch alone, as a couple, or a whole crowd. Trust me, you won't regret it!",

592,7 August 2004,GlitterzNStarz,10," Inspirational, heartwarming, perfect","*I don't think there's any spoilers, but I guess I'll put this here just in case.* ""Rocky"" is quite possibly the greatest movie ever made. You don't have to like boxing or Sylvester Stallone to love Rocky. There's humor, romance, drama, and action. Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is poor, sweet, and a little slow. Every one pretty much thinks he's a bum, but he has a big heart. He tries to woo Adrian (Talia Shire), his friend Pauly's (Burt Young) sister, but she's so shy she won't even look at him half the time. When he finally wins her over is about the time heavyweight champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) needs someone to fight--and he picks Rocky. Trained by the somewhat harsh Mickey (Burgess Meredith), Rocky works his tail off to get ready for the fight. He wants a chance to prove that he's not just some bum, and he does that and more. ""Rocky"" is the kind of movie that makes you cheer no matter how many times you see it. It definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Picture that it won in 1976. 10/10",
593,21 April 2011,sashank_kini-1,5, Schlocky,"The most memorable moment in Rocky is the love-scene between and Adrian, both steaming the otherwise fetid room with such clean passion that it surpasses all cardinal passions. Adrian first tries to resists; an act shy but with slow excitement, then acquiesces and lastly is enticed. Rocky slowly allures kisses and then makes love. Both connect emotionally, nullifying each other's weaknesses. The problem is that 'this' is the best scene in the movie, while the 'action' and the 'sport' which should succeed, sag. This kind of movies should be a little unpolished but not indecisive. Rocky made me feel like watching just a sweet romance rather than an action, an underdog story. It more seems like Boxing Practice 101. Rule 1: Gulp down six raw eggs Rule 2: Jog a mile or ten! ",

So if we were to look at Rocky as a defining moment for the Stallone's star then yeah, it's a pretty important film.

He goes to this persistently and persistently. The main character prepares his body and spirit with the most severe training and huge loads. With his human simplicity and charm, Rocky won the hearts of a huge number of boxing fans. But to become a ""favorite"" in boxing, it is not enough to be cute and charming. You have to fight. You have to fight selflessly and detachedly, as if every fight is the last. Rocky is not afraid of authoritative names and titles; he boldly enters into battle with any opponent.

If we can pretend for just one moment that we live in a world free of Rocky II - V, we can admire a true piece of cinematic mastery. Rocky is a story worth telling. To suggest that this film is merely a story of a chump fighter's shot at respect in the bigger and brighter world, is to only scratch the surface of what makes Rocky truly great. Rocky Balboa represents the plight of second generation immigrants everywhere, struggling to survive in a society which has yet to accept them. Set in the Philadelphia Italian ghettos, Rocky explores the lives and hardships of the people around him aswell as Balboa's own. In this case Rocky's opportunity becomes a chance for one man to raise the spirit of an entire people' and is beautifully depicted in the famous running scene. It is testimony to the fact that one act can breakdown barriers and that the human spirit can turn survival into prosperity.

Likable characters, the way Rocky talks is so cool. This is one of the most memorable movies ever, you'll be shadow boxing everyday. A must-see.",

Stallone performances a very difficult role with a wide way of senses and when the film finishes you just think Sylvester will be Rocky forever . Now, at 2005 we can see that this is true. The supporting cast deserved an academy award for each of them...and what can I say about the Bill Conti marvelous music? I will always remember this film like a composition of quotidian characters that finish involved in a extraordinary situation not resolved with the typical Hollywood ending, but also have a little piece of the American dream came true. The conversation between Rocky and his old manager Mickey at the Italian Stallion's apartment worths his weight in gold.Like the rest of the film.I recommend it to everyone...It's the triumph of the Human Spirit!!!!

Don't get me wrong i liked Cinderella Man but it was too fabricated not like Rocky where you feel you are part of it and not just watching it. My parents used to hate me watching Rocky when i was younger , I would always watch it then go and belt my little brother up in a Rocky Rampage afterward.

I think it's a smart idea of the producers to let Rocky lose against Apollo after a great fight. Moreover I think it's a great choice to let Rocky live in a-not-so-wealthy neighborhood, but not let him be such over-the-top gangster. Many things in the movie were not planed (ex. there ought to be many more people skating on the ice, Stallone's father and brother got a role in the movie, Butkus wasn't the original dog they wanted), but they were all solved and it looked very smooth. I'd say Rocky is a brilliant underdog movie which shows in a realistic way the most beautiful things that mankind can have: courage, wills power and hope.",
643,23 August 2006,chriscates1,10, Still under-appreciated,"I know, I know, most people yawn when they hear about the next Rocky sequel, but these movies stand the test of time. The first Rocky movie, in my opinion is one of the greatest movies of the past 35 years. All those film students out there will be up in arms saying that is not possible. Most would say that some foreign film that nobody has ever heard of is the best. Though I had several film courses on a university level, I don't consider myself some scholar. I like what I like. My DVD collection is filled with Criterion titles and foreign films which I love, but it somehow all comes back to Rocky. It is one cliché after another, but it's brilliant in it's simplicity. How can you not root for this underdog? People say how stupid Rocky is, that he's an oaf, etc. Rocky ISN'T supposed to be some nuclear physicist, he's just a down on his luck, poorly educated boxer with a big heart. Take the sequence when he goes on his first date with Adrian. They are both nervous as nervous can be, but as we watch, they slowly start to open up to each other. A great example of this is when they're at the ice skating rink. The way they communicate and laugh is fantastic, one of the most ""real"" scenes I have ever seen in movie. Adrian says ""Why do you fight?"", Rocky says ""Because I can't sing and dance."". EXACTLY. The dialogue is crisp, they say exactly what they should say in that situation. Look at the ending, the scene where the winner is decided is a mere two second shot. Rocky isn't even paying attention, he's looking for Adrian. The scene where she's standing in the tunnel and starts to run to the ring after the fight still gets me misty after all these years (and I know I'm not the only one who gets like that!). This is a film about inspiration and not backing down. When Rocky gets up after the 14th round, his right eye swollen shut, his face looking like it was run over by a truck, he never backs down. He gestures to Apollo, as if saying ""Come on, bring it."". Apollo just shakes his head. Apollo may know he has already won the match, but Rocky won it all. He won self respect, the respect of Mickey, the respect of the country, and the love of Adrian. I've started jogging in the past few months and every time I'm at the park I try to push myself a little bit further. A film like Rocky shows us that we can all go the extra mile. This is a great film and not to be missed.",

Rocky is a very easy character to connect with. I'm sure there's many that feel like they never had their shot and if provided the opportunity they might just make it. This story certainly gives some support to that belief. Rocky is just your common Italian man struggling to get by living in Philly when he receives the opportunity of a lifetime to fight the world champion.,

Quite simply, this is the reason I got into watching films, and despite having seen it over 30 times I never tire of it's magic. I can't say what that magic is, otherwise it'd take something away from the film. If I'm down I watch Rocky, then I'm fine again. This film gives me something new every time I watch it, from the fight scene when I was a kid to punching meat to Adrian entering rocky's house for the first time. But what moves me more than anything, and no one else ever seems to mention it, is the scene in Rocky's house when he realises that he can't win the fight. The last time I watched it I had to stop the DVD for 5 minutes as I started howling like a baby. Don't ask why, just watch the greatest film ever made and ignore the snobs who say otherwise.

The ability to escape into a movie and become part of it is a rarity.  There will probably never be another underdog movie that will captive the general public as this one has done. This movie should definitely be in the top 250 films of all time.  If you have never seen this movie - rent it and enjoy it commercial free.  The DVD version has some excellent extras on the making of the film. It was a very low budget movie that nearly did not get made.

657,8 April 2008,jsterkel,10, Arguably One of the Best Movies of All Time,"Most people probably like Rocky but I don't think most people know how good the movie really is. To credit Stallone would be the start of why this movie is great. Not only is it great I think it is one of the greatest of all time. Now you might ask you mean it's Battleship Potemkin and Rocky? You might laugh and ignore the comment and read something else but I think that you might have to re watch the film with a different lens to appreciated it fully. Now I know that there is no Odessa Steps in Rocky so don't laugh. One reason that I love the film so much is that the message is so simple that anyone, including children, can grab hold of it. You can't say that for Potemkin. Another reason is that the film is completely heart and shows a character that is down and out. The character comes from no where and has nothing except love in his heart for a regular looking women. So typology is something that Potemkin and Rocky share, that is to Rocky's credit. The scenes consist of seemingly everyday conversations with everyday thoughts, nothing profound is said, at least not on the surface. What is really being said here that the America Dream is alive and well, honestly that was said more in the sequels but I'm talking about the original movie. What I think is being said is that in life we go the distance. Rocky doesn't win the match, he simply goes the distance when no one except a handful of people told him that he could even fight Apollo Creed. That is the magic of the movie the magic is that we all have the ability to fight the good fight in life. We need more movies to not tell us that we will all have a slice of the American pie but that within us all is a un-dying spirit that can not be put out by even the greatest of circumstances.

I had to see every one not just once but over 100+ times.  I am not exaggerating, every time a ROCKY movie is on TV I just have to watch it.  I just got the DVD box set and I watch each movie over and over again.  I really like the bonus footage.  I also bought ""ROCKY"" the game for X BOX!  Hands down the best boxing game I have ever played and probably ever will play until maybe they release another one down the road.  I am from Pennsylvania and Philadelphia is only a quick drive away.  I always try to visit the Philadelphia art museum and every run a few times up and down the ROCKY stairs!  On top of the stairs there is a mold of his sneakers, really cool to see!  I have even gone to the Spectrum a few times to get some pictures of the ROCKY STATUE.  Oh yea and you can play as the ROCKY STATUE in the video game! You can also play as Mickey! I always look like a nut hanging from the ROCKY STATUE but oh well I am just ROCKY's biggest fan.  Oh and if you visit Philadelphia go to PATS STAKES home of the best cheese steaks in the world you will see that Sylvester Stallone was there and you will see ROCKY's name engraved in the front sidewalk!  Check it out!  In conclusion, even though this was a fictional character these movies defiantly pull you into a boxer's life that went from rags to riches.   I also like these movies because of the great training scenes.  If someone had to ask me what was my favorite ROCKY movie, I would have to say it is tied between ROCKY I and ROCKY IV, but for the best training and sound track I would have to pick ROCKY IV! SURVIVOR is the best!  I hope Sylvester Stallone and MGM gets together and agrees on good budget for ROCKY VI!  I know there are millions of fans out there, not only within the United States but in other countries waiting for ROCKY VI!  I will leave you all by saying ""YO ADRIAN I DID IT!""",

675,27 February 2023,claszdsburrogato,8, Rocky (1976) Amazing and inspiring,"More than forty years since its release and this film remains great. The film works very well on Rocky's development and his training to reach his goal. The way the film presents this development is wonderful and brings us much closer to the character. You don't watch the movies for the fights, you watch them for Rocky himself and his drama. Even the fight scenes aren't even close to being the best moments of the film. The romance built is not perfect, but it is also very interesting to follow throughout the film. This is not just a sports and fight movie, it is an inspiring story and a very well constructed drama.",
676,18 February 2005,bunac2002,10, Rocky the Love Story,"How can you write a review of Rocky and not mention the relationship between the protagonist himself and Adrian. I admit that this is an enthralling story about an underdog fighter that makes it all the way to the top yet that isn't the focus of the film. I think the point of Rocky is that it is his love for Adrian that makes him strong. At first they are the unlikeliest of matches yet he sees the beauty in her that nobody else does. This strong theme is carried throughout all five (not so much the fifth film actually) Rocky films and he makes it clear that the fame, the money, the big house doesn't mean a thing without her.",
677,25 April 2015,delawarejason,9," Cinematic and actual ""First big break""","Rocky is not perfect. I will not try to convey that it is. But just like the character Rocky, the movie more than makes up for its shortcomings with true, honest heart. As strange at is seems, the parts of this film that resonate the strongest with an audience happen outside of the boxing ring. While this is a sports movie, the characters drive this movie, not so much the action (which honestly didn't age as well as Sly). I think that comes down to Sylvester's script, which captures the true voice of real people. Rocky may not speak eloquently but the message is delivered in such a natural way that it is easy to let one's guard down and suspend disbelief, allowing the viewer to fall in love with these characters and their heart. Mr. Stallone had to fight tooth and nail to bring this story to life as he saw it, wage an uphill battle of seemingly impossible odds that only a crazed man loyal to his passion would be willing to endure. And this comes through for his titular character as well. When that much earnest drive is poured into the characters, the film simply cannot help but benefit. Overall, I highly recommend this film. Watch the way the characters interact, listen to the way they talk. They are living, breathing, fighting and loving humans; Therein lies the magic of ""Rocky"".",
678,7 September 2004,Orestes988,10," ""Adrian!!"" Stallone no Big Dumb Animal","I would have to say that Rocky is one of those gem flicks that everyone has seen but is misrepresented as a simple dramatic underdog story. This movie is so chock full of metaphorical scenes and symbols the movies' screenwriter Silvester Stallone must have been aware of its complexities. The opening scene (that lays the whole context of the whole movie) shows a stained glass window of the Virgin Mary and then slowly tilts down into a haze of smoke and darkness (hell, chaos). It is obvious to the majority of the audience that Rocky is a part of a group of characters in the film that are incomplete and represent complete anonymity, but the underlining theme of the rest of the movie is salvation; of the economic, political and self. Rocky knows the difference between what is right and wrong and although he is not an intelligent character, he is morally good internally. Apollo represents god and divinity and Rocky is the humble and kind subservient. Many, many beliefs, values, ideals behind this movie. A classic religious tale.",

I'm a guitar player and always wish to get my shot at the big time. I think Stallone acted great and the series has offered great quotes for our lives. I could watch these all day and not get tired of them. My favorite part is when Apollo knocks Rocky down in the 14th round for a 7 count and Rocky gets up and motions for him to come back at him again because he wont give up. The heart in the movie is awesome and anytime i have a task i try to have heart to press on even through adversity because....I was nobody.it really don't matter if I lose this fight. It really don't matter if this guy opens my head, either. 'Cause all I wanna do is go the distance. and if I can go that distance, you see, and that bell rings and I'm still standin', I'm gonna know for the first time in my life, see, that I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood.",

Although some would argue it's not the best one and there's there choice but I always find that usually the first in a line of films can't be topped. Sly does a grand job as you Burt Young you have probably seen before plays a good role as Adrian's brother but Adrian herself AKA Talia Shire steals the show with her shy retiring ways, that Rocky has to try and bring her out of, though a little hard with her protective brother watching her every move, So if you have not seen it, where have you been?

Rocky is an amateur boxer, who is going nowhere fast, is given the opportunity to fight the heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed, who is played by Carl Weathers. Rocky's boxing skills are very raw at first, but with the help of a gritting old boxing trainer, played by Burgess Meredith, turns into a hard-hitting boxer. Rocky is a sports drama, which deals with redemption across many different aspects. The director uses many different camera angles to give the audience the feeling of actually taking the hits from Apollo Creed during the scene at the end of the film. Throughout the film, the audience sees the struggles that Rocky has both in and out of the boxing ring. By the end of the film, the audience really connects with Rocky and is pulling for him every punch that is thrown. The cinematographer uses two great montages to cover a lengthy period of time when Rocky is training with Mick as well as the final rounds of the fight. The training scene is one of the great series of scenes of the 1970s films. The famous Rocky run has been shown in numerous different films and television shows, including The Simpsons, Nutty Professor, and The Fresh Prince of Bel- Air. Both of these theatrical montages are put to great soundtrack music that brings the audience further into overall experience.",

I first saw it when the BBC were going through the Rocky series and since then it is fair to say I have been a big fan. Yes, the subsequent four are below the standards of the original but it is totally over the top to say that they tarnished the first and greatest. So many of the scenes are memorable...the beef beating, the run through the market where just a random guy off the street (totally unplanned so I am told) threw Sly an orange, the characters and the setting. It is certainly the only movie that can make me want to go for a jog at 6am. I haven't drunk any eggs for breakfast yet but I am sure it is just a matter of time.

He plays Rocky Balboa the underdog boxer who gets a chance to fight the world champion Apollo Creed. As the original advert claimed, he had a 'Million-to-one shot' He suits the character perfectly and plays him to great ability. I voted 10/10 for this film! I'm a Stallone fanatic! I have seen all five of the rocky films and own the Rocky anthology DVD box set, a great buy and well worth the money! If you liked this film see also: The rest of the Rocky films, The Rambo Trilogy, Judge Dread, Assassins and all the other great films in which he acted!

691,22 March 2005,cremeemblem75,9, A True American Classic,"This is the movie that pitted a second-rate prize fighter against the reigning heavyweight champion of the world. Rocky is not just a boxing movie but it is about the fact that in America anyone can get the opportunity of a lifetime. From the opening scene to the climatic finish, Rocky is a timeless masterpiece. Stallone did an exceptional job with the script and acted Rocky's character to near perfection. This movie has many classic scenes from Rocky's run up the steps of the Philadelphia Art Museum to his moment alone in the Philadelphia Spectrum. Bill Conti did an amazing job in helping make Rocky a masterpiece. Conti's ""Gonna Fly Now"" was perfectly placed in the scene in which Rocky runs throughout South Philadelphia up the steps of the art museum. It was really in the ring where Conti actually did his real work though. ""Going the Distance"" and ""Final Bell"" emotionally triggered audiences at the perfect moments and made the Bi-centennial fight more than just a brawl but a fight for survival between the underdog and the champ. Burt Young (Paulie), Talia Shire (Adrian), Burgess Meredith (Mickey), David Thayer (Jergens) and Jimmy Gambina (Mike) all did tremendous jobs at depicting their respective characters. When you scrap all this together you get an Oscar winning movie that is so beautifully constructed that it could bring a tear to anyone's eye.",

Stallone is a genially movie's writer, but the best character is Paulie, the drunk Adrian's brother. Is really good time, the two hours spends for see Rocky. MMA never shine like the golden box years. The final of this movie is unpredictable and perfect. The most incredible of the whole plot is the ability to create a thought- provoking plot without a villain. Apollo Creed, in no instance would fit into this concept. On the contrary, despite being a marketer, he believed in the concept of nation of opportunities. He is the reason that Rocky got an opportunity and took a swing at the fate of a failed amateur sportsman",

It's a love story between a guy who thinks he is dumb and a bum and an introvert girl who thinks she isnt pretty. Rocky doesnt even want to win the match. He just wants to go the distance. At the end of the movie after the match as people try to interview him, all he does is call for adrian. Even as people are asking for a rematch he doesnt want one. He realized in that moment all he wants is her. She is what makes him feel like he is not a bum. At the end of the movie very faintly they mention that creed wins by split decision but if you are not paying attention you cant even hear it over rocky and adrian telling each other ""i love you"" as the movie ends.

Burt Young does an excellent job as well as Rocky's brother-in-law, though Young does portray an unbearable, mean, obnoxious scoundrel who is mean to his own sister/Rocky's wife played so convincingly by Talia Shire.

I am not a sports movie fan and I guess boxing is considered a sport but I am a huge fan of all five movies. It isn't a movie you can watch part way and stop.

Rocky only took 28 days to make and didn't cost very much. Sylvester Stallone is brilliant as Rocky Balboa the lovable boxer and he also wrote the film. Talia Shire is superb as the shy and meek Adrian. And who could forget Burt Young in his great role playing Adrian's loser brother. Carl Weathers is superb as the Jive talking Apollo Creed. I just love this film. I'm 11 years old and I'm a huge movie buff and know heaps about movies,I love to drive my friends crazy when I talk about Rocky. I even did my speech on the Rocky films this year and got a very good mark. This film was awarded with The best picture Oscar,The best Director Oscar and the best cinematography oscar. Sadly Sylvester Stallone did not win Best Actor or best Screenplay which is very sad because it was probably his only chance judging by his latest movies.

Not only is the movie incredibly inspiring and well made, but it is a shadow story of Stallone's life.  If one looks deep into this movie, and they don't worry about the other four films (which are only good for fun entertainment value if your a real Rocky-fan) than... you'll realize just how great this movie is.

Although I appreciate his humility near the end of the movie, I feel he lacked the gratitude of the absolute lottery he won by being picked by Apollo. The development of Adrian is also really odd as shes first portrayed as this shy, quiet, nerd with glasses yet does a complete 180 after being pretty much harassed by stallone. As for Apollo we really don't get to know much of what should be the antagonist of the movie until the very end, and all we do figure out is that he is incredibly cocky (big shock). I feel stallone attempts to catch a relatability factor with his character yet tries too hard with making him perfect that his very obvious imperfections seem unintentional which they probably are. I'm not even going to get into Paulie and Mickey as completely (almost) forgettable characters. The only reason they're not completely forgettable is due to their yelling and bashing throughout the whole movie that leaves me wondering what they were trying to say if they could communicate like real adult people. Now this one might be just a difference in eras but watching rocky's interactions just felt so off, like he was unaware of the nonsense he was saying. The film now just really seems like it aged horribly but hopefully back in the day it would have come off as a much better film, which might have been the case as it won best picture. I'd hate to leave this review as a complete bash on Rocky which is why I'd like to add even after everything I've wrote that the cinematography was impressive and with the little Stallone had he did a lot better than a lot of people could, even those with much more.",

BAR NONE. Sure the sequels were dodgy, but relevant i believe. But for Stallone, to come up with work of art of how a fighter from the gutter becomes heavyweight champ cannot be ignored. Superb acting from Stallone to bring HIS character 'Rocky' to life. This film is a brilliant example to everyone that nothing is impossible and nothing should get between you and your dreams",
725,28 February 2005,jdrogove,10, One of the best movies ever made.,"Winner of four Oscars including Best Picture and the recipient of several more Oscar nominations, Rocky is a phenomenally heartfelt and motivational movie about an underdog from South Philadelphia who overcame the odds to ""go the distance"" with the heavyweight champion of the world. Shot for a mere million dollars, Rocky grew to become a symbol of the American Dream. Sylvester Stallone does an amazingly realistic job portraying Rocky Balboa. For the full 2 hours, you are taken on a journey where Stallone literally becomes Rocky, a feat few actors are able to pull off. In the supporting roles, Talia Shire, Burt Young, and Burgess Meredith all match the realism and power of Stallone's performance. Without a doubt, Rocky is one of the best movies ever made, eclipsing other classic boxing movies such as Raging Bull and the recently made Million Dollar Baby.",
726,5 August 2022,SethGoldstein,9, Powerful sports film,This is the underdog story that really hits the core of the heart. That really pulls you in because of the character Rocky. Who is a very likable and yet flawed amateur boxer. The struggles to make ends meet and falling in love aspect of this film was raw. Even the slow scenes had my attention and I really felt for the character Rocky Balboa despite him being fictional and all. Sylvester Stallone did a fantastic job writing to script and I could tell why he wanted badly to take the lead role in this. Even by making big sacrifices and taking cuts in his paycheck to make it work. It really is a touching boxing film. The build up has a lot of meat to it and when it hits it brings the momentum. This is a movie about a underdog that goes the distance to prove to himself. It has heart and has elements that uplift and inspire the viewers. This is a true classic that will be a part of Sylvester Stallone's legacy.,
727,28 January 2022,marcellajacobs-11868,6, A Love Story,"Although Rocky has been hailed as one of the greatest stories of underdog victory of all time, it is less about boxing and more about the love story that develops between Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) and Adrian (Talia Shire). In the 1976 film, written by Stallone, we follow Rocky in his journey of self-discovery and his influence over Adrian. His desire to woo her leads to her realization that she is worthy of love. Will Rocky discover his inner victor and be able to win Adrian's heart and defeat the current heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers)?",

729,1 June 2018,janvils,5, My dad forced me to watch it,"As my father brought us to watch the movie we got disappointed. He had it way better remembered in his mind that it was. It can't hold on to the suspense from nowadays. Either way, the camera is well guided and shows nice pictures, also the background story how Sylvester Stallone made the studios to produce his film is stunning.
In conclusion for 16 years old, it can only impress with the picture quality and the background story. The story hasn't aged so that you can be packed during the film.",
